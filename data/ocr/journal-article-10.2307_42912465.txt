<plain_text><page sequence="1">JBL 132, no. 4 (2013): 749-767 Sacred Spaces, Objects, Offerings, and People in the Priestly Texts: A Reappraisal MICHAEL B. HUNDLEY Mbh64@georgetown.edu Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057 In the Priestly texts, holiness is understood both as an absolute and as a relative term to demarcate the hierarchy within the holy sphere. Rather than primarily redefining the term "holy," the present work aims to determine the terms function in describing spaces, objects, offerings, and people in the Priestly account. While there are several different levels of holiness for people, places, objects, and offer- ings, the Priestly writers have only two terms at their disposal, "holy" and "most holy," which they use in a dizzying combination to situate elements hierarchically. Nonetheless, once the Priestly language is clarified, elements in the holy sphere fit into a fairly consistent hierarchy. Within this taxonomie system, people have access to spaces and objects of one level of holiness higher than they themselves possess. While accessing one degree higher is acceptable, two degrees proves fatal. The Priestly labels "holy" and "most holy" mediate access, express the privilege and unnaturalness of access, and indicate the consequences of improper contact, thereby safeguarding the divine abode from improper encroachment and human- ity from the corresponding punishment. Traditionally, scholars have divided the Priestly tabernacle complex into three spheres of graded holiness: the most holy inner sanctuary, the holy outer sanctuary, and the unlabeled court.1 However, this convenient division is not always borne An earlier, abridged version of this article was presented at the European Association of Biblical Studies (EABS) Annual Conference in association with the Bible and Sacred Space section of the Society of Biblical Literature, in Tartu, Estonia, in July 2010 and benefited greatly from the discussion that followed the presentation, especially the comments of Christopher Meredith of the University of Sheffield. I would like to thank the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation for giving me the time and resources to finish this article. Thanks are also due to the JBL reviewers, who challenged me to sharpen and expand my argument in various ways. 1 See, most recently, Mark K. George, Israels Tabernacle as Social Space (SBL Ancient Israel and Its Literature 2; Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2009), 71-73. By labeling the outer sanctuary "holy" and the inner sanctuary "most holy" (based, e.g., on Exod 26:33) and assuming 749</page><page sequence="2">750 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) out in the textual description, which is more varied and complex than has often been assumed, especially in the use of "holy" and "most holy" as descriptors. For example, in several texts, such as Lev 6:9 and 19 (Eng. 6:16, 26), the court is explic- itly called holy (UHp),2 while the altar within it is referred to as most holy (UHp D^unp) (Exod 29:37; 30:28-29; 40:10), the same term used to describe the inner sanctuary, or holy of holies (□"»urrpn unp; Exod 26:33-34). The only difference is that the designator for the inner sanctuary has the definite article attached. In fact, the altar is referred to as "most holy" in more places than the inner sanctuary (Exod 29:37; 30:28-29; and 40:10 vs. 26:33-34). In 40:10, the bronze altar is even referred to as most holy in (deliberate) contrast to the tabernacle (pWD) and all that is in it, including the inner sanctuary, which is simply labeled "holy" in the preceding verse (40:9). Against the generalizing trend, which glosses over the terminological com- plexities, some scholars have noted the more complicated terminological dis- tinctions between places and objects. Menahem Haran and Philip P. Jenson have significantly furthered our understanding of the sacred gradations within taber- nacle space, yet distinctions in sacred terminology largely lie outside their purviews. Haran simply notes the terminological flexibility, while Jenson comments generally about the variable and often comparative force of holiness.3 Others, such as Martin Noth, explain the discrepancies diachronically.4 As is often the case, Jacob Milgrom has done the most thorough and compel- ling examination, in which he recognizes the complexity of the textual representa- tion and offers some important preliminary remarks. Notably, he labels all space in the tabernacle holy space, equating the tabernacle court with a holy place. He also differentiates between the most holy furniture in the court and the holy space in which it is located, divides offerings into two categories, and argues for nonpriestly access to all areas of the court and that only most holy space receives purgation.5 a progression of increasing holiness, the court is implicitly considered "common," or at least less holy than the "holy" outer sanctuary. 2 Rather than using the adjective U&gt;n£, the Priestly writers consistently employ the nominal form unp to describe spaces, objects, and offerings. Thus, in this instance, UHp could be more accurately translated as "holy place" and, when referring to objects and offerings, "holy thing(s)" and "holy offering(s)" respectively. 3 Haran, Temples and Temple-Service in Ancient Israel: An Inquiry into the Character of Cult Phenomena and the Historical Setting of the Priestly School (Oxford: Clarendon, 1978), 172 n. 50; Jenson, Graded Holiness : A Key to the Priestly Conception of the World (JSOTSup 106; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1992), 91-92. 4 Noth, Leviticus: A Commentary (trans.

Wright, The Disposal of Impurity: Elimination Rites in the Bible and in Hittite and</page><page sequence="3">Hundley: Sacred Spaces , Objects, Offerings , and People 751 However, his analysis appears piecemeal throughout his commentary and in many places requires clarification and elaboration. Indeed, although numerous studies have appeared on holiness, it would seem that none has yet appropriately applied the Priestly writers' (P)6 primary language - holiness - to define and delimit the sacred compound. Nor have these studies sufficiently explored the implications of P s definitions and the limits of its descriptive terminology. Rather than primarily redefining the term "holy," the present work aims to determine the terms function in describing spaces, objects, offerings, and people in the Priestly account.7 I. Separating the Divine Sphere Like most of their contemporaries, the Priestly writers naturally sought to express the importance of divine space structurally and with verbal descriptors to label the structures that divided that space into various zones. In fact, the Priestly writers, like ancient Near Eastern architects, shape temple/tabernacle space for the Mesopotamian Literature (SBLDS 101; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1987), 232-35; and idem, "Holiness: Old Testament," ABD 3:237-48. Rather than my summarizing all of Milgrom's remarks here, his multiple contributions will emerge as appropriate over the course of the analysis. 6 The nature and extent of the Priestly texts remain disputed. The present inquiry examines the tabernacle texts in Exodus-Numbers according to Noth's classic delineation of P ( The Chroniclers History [trans. H. G. M. Williamson; JSOTSup 50; Sheffield: JSOT Press, 1987], 107- 47). The disputed P(-like) texts in Numbers (compare Noth with Israel Knohl, The Sanctuary of Silence: The Priestly Torah and the Holiness School [Minneapolis: Fortress, 1995] and Reinhard Achenbach, Die Vollendung der Tora : Studien zur Redaktionsgeschichte des Numeribuches im Kontext von Hexateuch und Pentateuch [Beihefte zur ZABR 3; Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 2003]) will be included, since, regardless of whether they stem from the Priestly hand(s), they seem to be aimed at filling out the Priestly portrait. However, they will be understood as secondary to the primary P texts in Exodus and Leviticus. Texts from H, the Holiness Legislation (following the more neutral rendering of Baruch J. Schwartz, The Holiness Legislation: Studies in the Priestly Code [in Hebrew; Jerusalem: Magnes, 1999], 17-24), will also be used secondarily to add contour to P's portrait, since H functions as a sequel and occasional complement to P (Christophe Nihan, From Priestly Torah to Pentateuch: A Study in the Composition of the Book of Leviticus [FAT 2/25; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2007], 546). Rather than entering into the debate on the extent of the Holiness Legislation outside of Leviticus 17-26 (compare Knohl, Sanctuary , with Milgrom Leviticus 17-23: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary [AB 3A; New York: Doubleday, 2001], 1337-44; idem, "HR in Leviticus and Elsewhere in the Torah," in The Book of Leviticus: Composition and Reception [ed. Rolf Rendtorff and Robert A. Kugler; VTSup 93; Leiden: Brill, 2003], 24-40; see also Nihan, Priestly Torah, 559-75), H will be limited to Leviticus 17-26, an ascription with which most commentators agree. Finally, although diachronic analysis is undoubtedly helpful in illuminating the uses of holiness terminology, the present study approaches the Priestly texts synchronically. Namely, it examines the Priestly texts in the form in which they appear (according to Noths delineations) embedded in the MT of the Pentateuch. 7 On the potential pitfalls of using holiness as an organizing principle, see George, Israels Tabernacle , 105-11.</page><page sequence="4">752 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) purpose of constructing a home for the deity that appropriately mediates contact between the deity and the people.8 Most fundamentally, its walls and doorways physically separate divine space from mundane space and divide the larger space into various smaller spaces.9 Several other factors also illuminate the spatial hier- archy within the divine sphere of the Priestly tabernacle, such as proximity to the deity, the composition of the furnishings, ritual action, and access. 10 Most important for our study, the label "holy" (unp) is a primary way of highlighting the significance of divine space and dividing it hierarchically into smaller spaces. Holiness In the Priestly texts, UHp is a multifaceted root, used in at least two ways: as an absolute and as a comparative.11 First, holiness may be understood in an absolute sense; people and objects are either holy or not. Although it is difficult to categorize more precisely, at a minimum, holiness is an inherent quality of Yhwh, who may be understood as "separate from the created world."12 Holiness then may 8 See Michael B. Hundley, "Before YHWH at the Entrance of the Tent of Meeting: A Study of Spatial and Conceptual Geography in the Priestly Texts," Z AW 123 (201 1): 15-26; see also G. J. Wightman, Sacred Spaces: Religious Architecture in the Ancient World (Ancient Near Eastern Studies, Supplement 22; Leuven: Peeters, 2007), 932. 9 See Hundley, "Before YHWH," esp. 18, and the references cited therein. 10 On the material gradations of the tabernacle, see Haran, Temples and Temple Service , 158-65; Jenson, Graded Holiness , 101-6. Regarding access, see Haran, Temples and Temple Service , 175-88; Jenson, Graded Holiness , 107-8. Although space does not permit a sufficient summary, the amount, nature, and extent of ritual action in the court, at the altar, and in the outer and inner sanctuaries, especially to inaugurate, maintain, and remove pollutants, are likewise informative (on proper ritual procedure for consecration, see, e.g., Wright, "Holiness," 244-45). 11 The concept is difficult to define and its etymology difficult to pinpoint (see Walter Kornfeld, "iznp qdš ," TDOT 12:522-23; William H. C. Propp, Exodus 19-40: A New Translation with Introduction and Commentary [AB 2 A; New York: Doubleday, 2006], 682). Rather than offering a new and exhaustive definition, the present study will examine how the label functions in its various tabernacle contexts. See the survey in Hundley, Keeping Heaven on Earth: Safeguarding the Divine Presence in the Priestly Tabernacle (FAT 2/50; Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2011), 71-73. 12 Schwartz, "Israels Holiness: The Torah Traditions," in Purity and Holiness: The Heritage of Leviticus (ed. M .J. H. M. Poorthuis and J. Schwartz; Jewish and Christian Perspectives Series 2; Leiden: Brill, 2000), 48, drawing on the definition of "holy" by Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy: An Inquiry into the Non-rational Factor in the Idea of the Divine, and Its Relation to the Rational (trans. John W Harvey; London: H. Milford, 1923). Jan Joosten refers to Gods "unspeakable nature" (People and Land in the Holiness Code: An Exegetical Study of the Ideational Framework of the Law in Leviticus 1 7-26 [ VTSup 67; Leiden: Brill, 1 996] ,123). This is not to deny corporeality or to suggest that Yhwh is entirely absent from and dissimilar to creation, only that his presence in it is (somewhat) unnatural, an intrusion of the divine into mundane space (on this important topic, see further the provocative work of Benjamin D. Sommer, The Bodies of God and the World</page><page sequence="5">Hundley: Sacred Spaces , Objects , Offerings, and People 7 S3 refer to the qualities that set Yhwh apart. By contrast, no person, place, or object is intrinsically holy. For example, on its own, the ark is simply a pretty box. Rather, holiness is derived exclusively from its source, Yhwh, and roughly connotes belong- ing to the deity and thus to the divine sphere. As we will see, holiness is more than just a label; it likewise seems to carry some of the dangerously potent divine essence. A similar principle seems to be at work elsewhere in the ancient Near East. In both Mesopotamia and the Priestly texts, elements closely associated with the deity may absorb some of the divine essence. In Priestly terms, they become holy. In polytheistic Mesopotamia, they are often divinized. More particularly, objects, such as thrones and other temple furniture, crowns, chariots, and weapons attain some measure of divine status.13 Rather than simply being labeled holy, these items are divinized; that is, they receive offerings and are listed with the divine determinative. In essence, they "became deities by contagion,' by a transfer of divinity to them from the inherently numinous gods that owned them and with whom they were in frequent contact."14 There is evidence of a similar tendency in Hittite Anatolia, where constituent parts of temple structures- such as walls, windows, doors, thrones, and altars - likewise receive offerings and are listed with the divine determinative.15 of Ancient Israel [Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009]); cf. Robert Kawashima, "The Priestly Tent of Meeting and the Problem of Divine Transcendence: An Archaeology' of the Sacred," JR 86 (2006): 256-57: "An intrusion of transcendence into the empirical, [Yhwh's glory] is dangerous and volatile, a toxic and hazardous substance, as it were, requiring proper containment." Karel van der Toorn refers to holiness as the semantic equivalent of the Mesopotamian divine melammu. Namely, gods are holy in the sense that they exude radiance, splendor, and luminosity ("God (I)," DDD [2nd ed.], 361). Holiness, then, seems to be an inherent divine quality, like melammu , that can be conferred on or absorbed by the nondivine (on the Akkadian concept of divine splendor, see more expansively Elena Cassin, La splendeur divine: introduction à letude de la mentalité mésopotamienne [Civilisations et sociétés 8; Paris: Mouton, 1968]); see further Shawn Zelig Aster, "The Phenomenon of Divine and Human Radiance in the Hebrew Bible and in Northwest Semitic and Mesopotamian Literature: A Philological and Comparative Study" (Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 2006), 29-176. 13 See esp. Barbara Nevling Porter, "Blessings from a Crown, Offerings to a Drum: Were There Non-Anthropomorphic Deities in Ancient Mesopotamia?" in What Is a God ? Anthropo- morphic and Non-Anthropomorphic Aspects of Deity in Ancient Mesopotamia (ed.

Neal H. Walls; Boston: American Schools of Oriental Research, 2005), 23.</page><page sequence="6">754 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) Although the Priestly terminology and ancient Near Eastern terminology are dif- ferent, the eifects are similar; sacralized and divinized elements belong to the divine realm and are imbued with some of its essence. Second, holiness is also employed relatively to express the hierarchy within the divine realm. Although another term would be welcome to limit the confusion, no more suitable term exists in the Priestly vocabulary. Thus, while everything within the divine sphere falls under the category of holy, the Priestly writers also employ the labels "holy" (UHp) and the superlative "most holy" (trunp[n] unp) in often complex and confusing combinations in order to express the different grades of holiness16 within the holy sphere and the boundaries they communicate. The Textual Data With this general framework in hand, we now turn to a survey of the textual data. The entire divine sphere, circumscribed by the curtains of the court, is holy and conveniently labeled the UnpQ, "holy place" (Exod 25:8; Lev 12:4). 17 Within this sphere, the court, sometimes assumed to be common like the people, is referred to as a holy place, "unp" (Exod 28:43; Lev 6:9, 19 [Eng. 6:16, 23]). Everything within the divine sphere that is anointed with the special anointing oil, namely, the tent of meeting ("TplD bnn) and everything in it as well as the bronze altar and basin in the court, is labeled "most holy" (D^UHp IZHp) (Exod 30:26-29; Num 4:4). Although elsewhere referred to as "most holy," the tent, and, more specifically, the outer sanc- tuary within it containing the incense altar, table, and lampstand, are also called simply "holy" (urrp) in distinction to the "most holy" (D*»^rrp urrp) inner sanctuary (Exod 26:33-34). To further muddy the interpretive waters, the otherwise "most holy" inner sanctuary in Leviticus 16 is merely labeled "the holy place" (urrpn) (w. 2, 3, 16, 17, 20, 23, 27), while the outer sanctuary is called simply "the tent of meeting" (w. 16, 17, 20, 23, 33). Like the tent, all of the furniture is labeled "most holy" (Exod 30:26-29). At times, however, as in Exod 40:9, the same "most holy" items are called simply "holy," while the bronze altar retains its "most holy" status in v. 10. 16 See Jenson, Graded Holiness. 17 Jacob Milgrom, Studies in Levitical Terminology, vol. 1, The Encroacher and the Levite: The Term Äboda [University of California Publications, Near Eastern Studies 14; Berkeley: University of California Press, 1970], 23 n. 78; idem, Leviticus 1-16 , 754-55; cf. Haran, Temples and Temple Service , 14-15. The use of W*TpD to refer to the entire divine compound, including the court and tabernacle, is especially clear in Lev 12:4, which states that the parturient may not enter the UnpQ until the days of her cleansing are completed. If W"TpD here refers to the tabernacle alone, the warning would be senseless, since she has no access to this space regardless of her state of purity. Rather, the warning must be understood more generally, barring her access to the entire complex, which in her case refers to the court, the only place to which she has access under normal circumstances.</page><page sequence="7">Hundley : Sacred Spaces , Objects , Offerings , and People 755 Regarding offerings, the grain offering (nrüD), the so-called sin or purification offering (riNün), and the guilt or reparation offering (OWN)18 are all referred to as "most holy" (Lev 2:3, 10; 6:10, 18, 22 [Eng. 6:17, 25, 29]; 7:1, 6; 10:12, 17; 14:13), while the peace or well-being offerings (wübw nit),19 and the firstborn and first- fruits fall under the category of "holy" (Num 18: 12- 19).20 Anomalously, the burnt offering is not labeled at all, nor are the offerings in which blood is brought inside the tent (the nrua of the priest in Lev 6:16 [Eng. 6:23], the riNOn of the priests in Lev 6:23 [Eng. 6:30], and the nNün offerings on the Day of Atonement in Leviticus 16). II. Interpretive Framework It would seem that within divine space, there are several different levels of spaces and objects. However, the Priestly writers only have two terms at their dis- posal: "holy" and "most holy." Thus, they use them as well as the implicit factors mentioned above in a dizzying combination to situate spaces and objects hierarchi- cally. Despite the complexity, once the Priestly language is clarified, divine space and objects fit into a fairly consistent hierarchy. With this interpretive framework in mind, we will reexamine the primary data, proceeding from the lowest to the highest levels of holiness, and return to the most anomalous cases at the end. Holy Spaces Fundamentally, the entire divine sphere, that is, the area circumscribed by the curtains of the court, marks the divine domain and, as such, is holy space. Within this holy space, there are further classifications. As less important and less holy, the court and its curtains are called "holy" without further distinction,21 while the more 18 On the nature and function of the nNOT and DU?N offerings, see Hundley, Keeping Heaven , ch. 6 and esp. ch. 7, 179-85. 19 Regarding the translation, see, e.g., Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 204. 20 Wright, Disposal , 232; idem, "Holiness," 239; Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 182-83, 320, 394- 95. "Holy" offerings generally are not labeled "holy." They are to be distinguished from most holy offerings since they are at least partially consumed by nonpriests and are never labeled "most holy" See further the passages that contrast holy and most holy objects (Lev 10:12-16; 21:22; Num 18:9, 11, 19). 21 Leviticus 6:9 and 19 (Eng. 6:16, 23) clearly equate the tabernacle court with a holy place (Rashi; Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 392). Since the entire compound is technically a holy place, Unpü, the Priestly writers here specify that the priests may eat their portion of the grain offering (nrUQ) and the riNOT anywhere in the court. Since the location of priestly meals has been established, all subsequent references need only mention "a" or "the" holy place (6:20 [Eng. 6:27]; 7:6; 10:17, 18; 14:13; 16:24) (Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 392; pace Wright, Disposal , 232-35, who attempts to differentiate the two expressions).</page><page sequence="8">756 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) important tent of meeting is called "most holy" (Exod 30:26, 29). The most holy tent is further subdivided into two distinct zones, the less important outer sanctu- ary, which is called "holy," and the more important inner sanctuary, which is called "most holy" (Exod 26:33-34). In other words, within the most holy space of the tent, where everything is most holy, some things are designated holy and some things are designated most holy (see fig. 1 ). Within the confusing categories of most holy space, we may thus refer to the outer sanctuary as "holy of most holy" space and the inner sanctuary as "most holy of most holy" space. Perhaps more simply, while the entire sanctuary is designated "most holy," the outer sanctuary is one degree less holy than the inner sanctuary. In other words, while most holy, the outer sanctuary is merely holy relative to the more most holy inner sanctuary. Holy Space: The unpD Holy Most Holy Court Tabernacle Holy Most Holy Outer Sanctuary Inner Sanctuary Figure i. Divisions of Holy Space Holy Objects While holy spaces have three levels of holiness, the objects in them have four. The curtains of the court are implicitly holy, since they demarcate the holy sphere. The tent of goats' hair (Exod 26:7) and its cover of ram skin and U&gt;nn skin (Exod 26:14) may also simply be holy, since they explicitly serve to cover the most holy tabernacle. By contrast, since they have been anointed, the tabernacle curtains and all furniture in the divine sphere are designated "most holy" (Exod 30:26-29). 22 However, unlike with most holy spaces, the text does not explicitly differentiate between most holy objects. Instead distinctions must be inferred from an objects relative position and composition. The bronze altar occupies an ambivalent position. Since it is a most holy object (Exod 29:37; 30:28-29; 40:10; Lev 10:12) in the holy court, it indicates that the court is divided into two levels: the holy court and the most holy altar (and basin) within the holy court.23 As most holy, the altar is associated with the tent and its furniture, 22 It would seem, then, that anointing an object with oil elevates it to most holy status. As we will see, this does not hold for the anointing of people. 23 Contra Haran (Temples and Temple Service, 184), who divides the court into two areas of graded holiness, the more holy between the altar and the tent and the less holy between the</page><page sequence="9">Hundley: Sacred Spaces , Objects , Offerings , and People 757 that is, with the more intimate24 and important divine space and possessions, sug- gesting that it is more intimate and important than the rest of the court. However, although the altar is associated with the tent, several factors nonetheless indicate its lesser status.25 It is made of bronze26 in distinction to the gold of the tabernacle furniture, and it is visible to all in the congregation of Israel, who may approach it without touching it (Num 4: 1 5, 1 8-20), whereas all of the furniture within the divine sphere cannot even be seen.27 Most fundamentally, since it is located in the holy outer court, the altar is associated with that space, yet in an elevated capacity as a most holy object. Thus, on the holiness spectrum, the altar stands between the court and the tent and may be labeled a most holy object in holy space. On the next level of the holiness spectrum, the incense altar, table, and lamp- stand inside the tent of meeting are most holy items in most holy space (Exod 30:10, 26-29). They are made of gold and may be seen, touched, and approached only by the priests. Even the Levites responsible for carrying the furniture may not view it. Instead they must wait for priests to cover it so that they may transport it (Num 4:18-20; 18:3).28 entrance of the court and the altar (see further the critique of Milgrom, Studies, 207 n. 25; idem, Leviticus 1-16 , 147-49, 392-94). All space in the court, none of which has been anointed and regardless of its position, is simply holy, while the anointed furniture- the altar and basin- is most holy. 24 Since the inner sanctuary is understood to be the place of divine residence, that is, where Yhwh presumably resides or at least appears (e.g., Lev 16:2). Contrast, e.g., Gerhard von Rad, Old Testament Theology (trans. D. M. G. Stalker; 2 vols.; London: SCM, 1953), 1:237-39; Frank Moore Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: Essays in the History of the Religion of Israel (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1973), 245, 298-99; and Milgrom, Numbers ""DTDl: The Traditional Hebrew Text with the New JPS Translation (JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society, 1990), 374-75 (Milgrom asserts that divine presence in the tabernacle is "temporary, unpredictable, and symbolic") with, e.g., Tryggve N. D. Mettinger, The Dethrone- ment of Sabaoth: Studies in the Shem and Kabod Theologies (ConBOT 18; Lund: Gleerup, 1982), 83-97; idem, "The Name and the Glory: The Zion-Sabbath Theology and Its Exilic Successors," JNSL 24 (1998): 15; David H.

See also Hundley, Keeping Heaven , 66 and n. 56. 25 The bronze altar, like all of the objects in the tabernacle, falls into the category of most holy. However, since no term exists to express greater than most holy, its lesser status within the most holy category in relation to the furniture within the tent must be indicated in other ways, for example, through material composition and location. Regarding the descriptors "status" and "holiness," it would seem that the bronze altar is less holy within the larger "most holy" category and thus has less status than the other most holy items. Although perhaps not always the case, in this instance status equals relative holiness. 26 More specifically, it has an acacia wood (D^ÜU? ^P) core overlaid with bronze (nu&gt;l"ü) (Exod 27:1-2). 27Haran, Temples and Temple Service , 175-78. 28 Ibid., 178.</page><page sequence="10">758 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) The ark and m£D29 are the most intimate and important and thus most holy objects. They stand beyond the veil in the inner sanctuary, cannot be seen on pen- alty of death, even by the high priest (Lev 16:2, 13), 30 and may be approached and touched only under extreme circumstances, on the annual Day of Atonement. Like the furniture in the outer sanctuary, they are most holy objects in most holy space. To differentiate the ark and m£D from the table, lampstand, and incense altar, another subcategory is necessary. As the outer sanctuary may be referred to as "holy of most holy" space, the most holy objects within it are "most holy objects within the holy of most holy space." As the inner sanctuary is "most holy of most holy" space, the most holy objects within it are "most holy objects within the most holy of most holy space." Or, more simply, the ark and m£D are one degree more holy than the incense altar, table, and lampstand within the larger category of most holy.3 1 Holy Objects Holy Most Holy Court Curtains, Tent Coverings Bronze Altar in Incense Altar, Table, and Ark and Kapporet in Holy Court Lampstand in Holy of Most Most Holy of Most Holy Holy Outer Sanctuary Inner Sanctuary Figure 2. Division of Holy Objects 29 The meaning and etymology of the term ÍTISD are both puzzling. Scholars usually associate it either with cover or with atonement/purification. For a summary of the views with references, see Propp, Exodus 19-40 , 385-86; and Nihan, Priestly Torah , 44-46. It seems best to associate it with the verb 1£D (Bernd Janowski, Sühne als Heilsgeschehen: Studien zur Sühnetheologie der Priesterschrift und zur Wurzel KPR im Alten Orient und im Alten Testament [WMANT 55; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1982], 271-72 n. 457). This derivation seems to be the most likely and finds meaning especially on the Day of Atonement, likely forming an inclusio with the command to construct it in Exodus 25 (Nihan, Priestly Torah , 45-46, 382), a connection that was obvious to the Greek translators (so Klaus Koch, "Some Considerations on the Translation of kapporet in the Septuagint," in Pomegranates and Golden Bells : Studies in Biblical , Jewish, and Near Eastern Ritual Law, and Literature in Honor of Jacob Milgrom [ed. David P. Wright, David Noel Freedman, and Avi Hurvitz; Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 1995], 65-75; cf. Janowski, Sühne , 348-49; Cornelis Houtman, Exodus [4 vols.; Historical Commentary on the Old Testament; Leuven: Peeters], 3:382). It is perhaps best translated generally as "place of clearing" (cf. Houtman, Exodus , 3:382). Regarding "l£3D and the translation "clearing," see Hundley, Keeping Heaven, esp. 186-92, building on the translation of Propp, Exodus 19-40, 46 6-67. 30Haran, Temples and Temple Service, 178. 31 Within this larger most holy category, the bronze altar, which is a most holy object within holy space, is naturally one degree less holy than the items in the outer sanctuary and two degrees less holy than those in the inner sanctuary. See fig. 3 below.</page><page sequence="11">Hundley: Sacred Spaces , Objects , Offerings , a /id People 759 Holy Offerings Offerings likewise use the labels "holy" and "most holy," yet they do not employ subcategories. Those shared by people, priests, and the deity are simply considered holy,32 whereas the grain, nNOn, and offerings are labeled "most holy." Their elevated status is indicated also by their selective consumption; that is, they are shared by priests and the deity but are off-limits to nonpriests after the beginning of the ritual sequence (e.g., Leviticus 6-7). 33 Although one would expect burnt offerings to fall into this category, they are not labeled "most holy." Nonetheless, since holy and most holy apply to the portions of the offerings to be consumed, the burnt offerings, which are wholly burnt on the altar and thus leave no consumable portions except for the skin (Lev 7:8), for prac- tical purposes, need not be labeled at all.34 Offerings in which blood is brought inside the tent, while the remains are burnt (the priests grain and riNOn offerings and the rtNün offerings on the Day of Atone- ment), seem to form a discrete category or at least a different subcategory of most holy. Since Yhwh is their exclusive beneficiary and their blood alone is brought inside the tent, these offerings would be the most important and the most holy. However, because no term exists to describe the offerings as more (than) most holy and because, like the burnt offerings, there is no need to regulate the remains since there are none, these offerings are not labeled at all (Lev 6:16, 23 [Eng. 6:23, 30]; 16:27). 35 III. Access to Holy Spaces, Objects, and Offerings Within this taxonomie system, it seems that a person has access to spaces and objects of one level of holiness higher than he himself possesses - namely, the com- mon may access the holy, while the holy may access the most holy. More particularly, the common clean congregants may access the holy court, while the clean, holy priests may access the most holy space and objects.36 Within the most holy category, however, more qualifications emerge regarding access. Most holy objects have three subdivisions: the most holy objects in the court, 32 Indeed, all offerings must be holy, since Yhwh cannot partake of anything common, and, more simply, being presented to Yhwh, they become his possession and thus, by definition, holy. 33 See Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 443. 34 See ibid., 182-83, 320-21, 395. 35 The burnt offering may also fall under this more important most holy category because it is not labeled and it is (primarily) off-limits to priests and nonpriests. It may, however, be best to classify it as a different kind of most holy offering, one that does not need qualification because it leaves no remains. 36 Regarding lay access to the courtyard, see Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 147-48, contra Haran, Temples and Temple Service , 184-87.</page><page sequence="12">760 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) the outer sanctuary, and the inner sanctuary. Most holy spaces have two: the inner and outer sanctuaries. Priests have access to most holy space and objects in the court and the outer sanctuary. However, access to the inner sanctuary and its appur- tenances is limited to the most important priest and severely limited in terms of frequency and proximity. Namely, the high priest enters the inner sanctuary once a year with a visible and olfactory shield so that he cannot see and so that his scent does not offend the deity (Leviticus 16). As with holy spaces and objects, there seems to be a distinction among the holy priests. The high priest appears to possess a higher level of holiness than his priestly counterparts, indicated by his greater access, fuller initiation, double anointing, and better clothes.37 Although he never attains "most holy" status, the high priest seems to be more holy within the holy category, compared with the regular priests, who are less holy within the holy category. This distinction approx- imates the distinction between the inner and outer sanctuaries and thus helps to explain the priests relative access to those spaces.38 ¿s (1) Holy Objects / in Holy ' Space ' . / ' ' &gt; Clean . congregants / ' granted access / (2) Most Holy ' / / Objects in ' V Clean holy priests / / Holy Space ' //' granted access / (3) Most Holy / ' / Objects in ' / / ' / (Holy of) Most V/ Ì, Clean (more) holy ' / Holy Space /A / high priest alone ' ' / granted limited ' ' / access ' ' ' / (4) MoSt ' St / / ' ' I / Holy Objects in ' ' St / / NvXw ' 1 (Most Holy / / yf ' Most J / // ^^^vVHoly Space Objects in ascending degrees of holiness: (1) The court curtains and the tent coverings (2) The Bronze altar (3) The incense altar, table, and lampstand (4) The ark and kapporet Figure 3.

Hundley, Keeping Heaven , 60-62. 38 Regarding labeling priests and high priests holy, see further below under The Status of the Priests."</page><page sequence="13">Hundley: Sacred Spaces , Objectsy Offerings , and People 761 This principle of allowing individuals access to a higher level of holiness than they possess likewise applies to the offerings, in which there are three categories but only two labels. Holy offerings (e.g., the well-being, firstborn, and firstfruit offerings) are accessible to all clean congregants (e.g., Lev 7:1 5-2 1 ), while most holy offerings (e.g., the regular grain, nNün, and OWN offerings) are accessible only to priests (e.g., Lev 6:6-7:14). The unlabeled offerings, which seem to be more (than) most holy, in which the blood is brought inside the tent (the grain offering of the priest, the riNOn of the priests, and the nNün offerings on the Day of Atonement), are accessible only to the deity (Lev 6:16, 23 [Eng. 6:23, 30]; 16:27). This phenomenon also seems to carry rhetorical freight. For both the priests and the people, such access expresses the privilege of entering divine space.39 It communicates that, although they are permitted to enter that space, they do not really belong there and contact between humanity and the divine is unnatural and, as we will see, volatile.40 Although they are granted limited access, they must be careful not to transgress the boundaries carefully set.41 The Participants 9 Perspectives The dizzying taxonomie terminology may also be better understood when viewed from the various participants' perspectives. Broadly speaking, within tab- ernacle space, "holy" and "most holy" mark domains of access, dividing the sacred compound into three walled spheres: the court, the outer sanctuary, and the inner sanctuary. Within the larger world of the tabernacle, the world of the clean congre- gants is confined to the court. In that world, holy space and holy offerings represent the elements permissible for clean congregants, while the most holy altar, basin, and offerings are inaccessible. Here the superlative marks the elements that are visible and approachable yet ultimately off-limits and thus form the upper bound- ary within that space. Beyond the boundaries of their world lies another space with its own labels, the most holy tabernacle, hidden beneath and behind its more mun- dane coverings. The world of the priests extends logically beyond that of the people. The most holy elements in the court mark the exclusive purview of priestly access and activ- ity in the court, yet remain within view of the clean congregants. The tabernacle curtains mark another world, the world of most holy space, within which the rela- tively less holy space of the outer sanctuary, simply called holy, is permissible space. The more holy space, the inner sanctuary, called most holy space, lies physically 39 That is, access is a privilege, not a right. 40 See Kawashima, "Priestly Tent," 256-57. 41 Although it lies beyond the scope of the present article, it would be worth exploring whether the concept that individuals may access spaces and objects of one degree more holiness than they themselves possess has parallels in biblical, ancient Near Eastern, Jewish, or Christian literature.</page><page sequence="14">76 2 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) and visually beyond the world of the regular priests, hidden beneath and behind the veil. Within this world, like the altar in the court, the inner sanctuary is desig- nated with the superlative, indicating that it is off-limits as supreme space. As more holy than the holy priests, only the high priest has limited access to this most holy of most holy space. Within the spatial world of the inner sanctuary during the special annual ceremony, this space and its furniture are minimally accessible. How- ever, the deity himself, the superlative element within that sphere, remains physi- cally and visually inaccessible. Although the Priestly writers do not label him as such, Yhwh may be referred to as in Isaiah 6 as thrice holy, forming his own holy category distinct from all other persons and objects. Within the holy space of the tabernacle, the deity remains both near and far. As an individual becomes increasingly holy, Yhwh becomes increasingly close and accessible yet always remains beyond reach. Although each group has privileged access to divine space and may in some way interact with the deity in that space,42 no group has access to the deity himself, who remains in a world of his own.43 "Holy" is thus employed to indicate the importance of divine space and to differentiate its spaces and objects, serving as criteria for mediating access. The term also has a more immediate use, as it indicates the consequence of improper contact. The Consequences Certain elements within the holy sphere are also contagious.44 At the bottom level of the holiness spectrum, holy places and objects are not contagious; that is, they do not possess enough of the divine essence to transfer it to people and objects by contact. However, most holy objects (Exod 29:37; 30:26-29), offerings (Lev 6:10-1 1, 19-20 [Eng. 6:17-18, 26-27]), and spaces (Exod 30:26-29) are contagious to all who touch or enter them. Like severe pollution, the most holy has an energy 42 For the entrance of the tent of meeting as an access point, see Hundley, "Before YHWH " 43 The Priestly concept of a continuum linking humanity and divinity, which minimizes yet fails to eliminate the chasm between them, also may be compared with Moshe Idels notion of connectivity in Jewish mysticism and his rejection of Gershom Scholems denial of the possibility of true mystical contact between humanity and divinity in classical Kabbalah. See, briefly, Jonathan Garb, "Moshe Idels Contribution to the Study of Religion," Journal for the Study of Religions and Ideologies 6 (2007): 20-21. See Moshe Idei, Kabbalah : New Perspectives (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988); Gershom Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (rev. ed.; New York: Schocken, 1946); idem, Kabbalah (Jerusalem: Keter, 1974). 44 A similar principle seems to be at work in ancient Mesopotamia, in which certain elements absorb some of the divine essence by contagion and become divinized (see further above at n. 13). However, although divinity may be transferred from the deity to an object, the deified objects do not themselves seem to be contagious. Contact with them, nonetheless, is fraught with danger (see, e.g., Porter, "Blessings," 191-94, on the danger associated with divinized beds).</page><page sequence="15">Hundley: Sacred Spaces, Objects , Offerings, and People 763 of its own that can be transferred by contact, an energy that partakes of the divine sphere and is thus dangerous to the mundane world.45 What then is the effect of contracting holiness? Holiness contracted by objects maybe remedied in several ways: it maybe removed (e.g., from a garment or bronze pot; Leviticus 14); the consecrated object may be destroyed (e.g., an earthenware pot; Lev 6:20-21 [Eng. 6:27-28]); or the object may be attached to the holy sphere (e.g., Korah's censers in Num 17:2-3 [Eng. 16:37-38]). However, when an indi- vidual goes beyond his clearance level or inappropriately accesses most holy areas, holiness is fatal (Exod 28:35, 43; 30:20-21; Lev 8:35; 10:7; 16:2, 13; Num 1:51; 3:10, 38; 17:5 [Eng. 16:40];cf. 1:53; 8:19; 18:15, 22). Thus, while people may appropriately access spaces and objects one degree higher in holiness than they possess, two degrees will kill them. Since they are not holy, nonpriests who make contact with the most holy contract holiness fatally.46 Regardless of whether they make contact with an object or an offering, holiness destroys them.47 Priests, who are already holy, may safely contact the most holy without danger. However, as indicated above, the text records many instances where illicit contact proves fatal. Even the high priest, as the holiest 45 The activities surrounding the dedication and clearing of holy spaces and objects especially differentiate most holy from holy elements (on translating *1£D as clearing, see n. 29 above). Only most holy spaces and objects are anointed and are the object of blood manipulations. The holy court is never anointed, nor is "one drop of purgatorial blood [intentionally] spilled upon the curtains of the court or its floor" (Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 393). Thus, it would seem that elements must be anointed to become most holy, and only most holy elements receive clearing. 46 Although there is some debate whether ("all") refers to persons and objects or simply objects, it seems best to conclude that bD refers to both categories (Haran, Temples and Temple Service , 176, pace Milgrom, "Sancta Contagion and Altar/City Asylum," in Congress Volume: Vienna 1980 [VTSup 32; Leiden: Brill, 1981], 278-310; idem, Leviticus 1-16 , 446-55, after the rabbis). For Milgrom, sancta cannot transmit both holiness and death. However, it is possible that, if contracted inappropriately, volatile holiness could prove to be fatal. In other words, an individual can become holy by contacting any most holy sancta, yet contracting holiness will kill him unless he follows the proper protocol. In the end, the result is not of undue practical importance since, whether the person absorbs holiness and dies or holiness simply kills him, the end result is that he dies and that the most holy is lethally off-limits. Regardless of which position one takes, an additional problem remains. The Gershonite Levites, who are not holy, may carry the inner curtains (Num 4:25), which are most holy and thus should be lethal (Num 4:15) (see the tentative solutions of Haran, Temples and Temple Service, 179; and Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 50). It would thus seem that either the fatal consequences of contacting most holy sancta are not absolute, are not applied consistently, or are suspended for practical purposes. 47 However, there is little textual warrant for the fatal holiness of an offering, only mention of the consecrating power of the grain and riNün offerings (Lev 6:11, 20 [Eng. 6:18, 27]). The penalty may apply only to consuming most holy offerings, may be the enigmatic ITD, or possibly may not apply at all to persons.</page><page sequence="16">764 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) person, must be very careful in approaching the most holy inner sanctuary lest he die. Because the most holy divine sphere is wholly other, or at least wholly superior, any intersection between it and the mundane world is unnatural, threatening disas- ter. Thus, like nuclear power, divine energy is a volatile, dangerous force that must be carefully controlled and accessed.48 Viewed in this light, the descriptor "most holy" serves a new function in several instances. It is a warning that highlights the importance of most holy objects and spaces and the danger in coming into contact with them. In fact, the contagious quality of the most holy seems to function as an explanatory clause. For example, in Exod 30:29 contagious holiness seems to stand in apposition to and define what most holy means (Dna D^urrp unp vm unp' "and they will be most holy; whatever touches them will become holy"). The label "most holy," then, establishes the most serious boundaries of divine space and appropriately mediates contact between Israel and the deity, especially by warning people of elements that are more closely associated with the deity and are therefore especially dangerous and often dangerously off-limits. The text thereby displays a special concern for safeguarding the most holy and protecting the people from its lethal divine holiness. Thus, while certainly very dangerous, the holy is not as volatile as one might suspect.49 Instead, it is in many ways predictable, even rule- bound, enabling contact according to its strict regulations.50 The text thus uses various signals to warn people with different levels of access. The Priestly writers warn nonpriests about the altar, since it is the only most holy element they may approach.51 The text is careful to warn the Kohathite Levites, as bearers of the holy furniture, about the danger of improper contact with the most holy inner furniture, since they have a much greater chance of making illicit contact with it (e.g., Num 4:15, 20). The text takes pains to warn the priests, as the only people with access to the most holy elements, about proper conduct at the acces- sible most holy places and the dangers of approaching the inner sanctuary. The Priestly writers offer all these warnings so that the deity may be served appropriately and so that people may receive blessing instead of death.52 Rather than precisely outlining an abstract hierarchical system, the Priestly concern, as is often the case, seems to be more functional. They use "holy" and 48 See Stephen Quirke, Ancient Egyptian Religion (New York: Dover, 1992), 70; Rodney R. Hutton, Charisma and Authority in Israelite Society (Minneapolis: Fortress, 1994), 147; Propp, Exodus 19-40 , 490; Hundley, Keeping Heaven, 182. 49 Cf. Ottos tremendum. 50 Pace Sommer, Bodies of God, 118-21. 51 Even the most holy tabernacle is out of reach since it is covered by a tent of goats hair (Exod 26:7), which is covered by a cover of ram skin and OTH skin (26:14) (Haran, Temples and Temple Service , 162, 180). 52 When referring to these warnings directed at various groups of people, I speak merely of the textual world. The application of this textual world to its intended audience, whatever and whenever it may be, is far more problematic.</page><page sequence="17">Hundley : Sacred Spaces, Objects, Offerings, and People 765 "most holy" to mediate access to the deity, safeguarding the divine presence and the divine abode from improper encroachment and humanity from the correspond- ing, often lethal punishment.53 IV. Issues for Further Consideration My examination concludes by highlighting three anomalies of this complex system and suggesting possible solutions. The point of raising these issues at the end of the investigation is not to answer them definitively but to invite further research and discussion. Inconsistent Application of Terminology In some cases, the terms "holy" and "most holy" are applied inconsistently. In particular, most holy spaces and objects are sometimes simply called "holy."54 For example, in Exod 40:9 and 10, the anointed tent and its furniture are merely labeled "holy," while the bronze altar retains its most holy status. Understanding the des- ignator "most holy" as a warning may help to explain this anomaly. In general, it would seem that, when issues of contagion and danger are not in the foreground, it is more acceptable to label otherwise "most holy" objects "holy." In Exod 40:9 and 10, the priests seem to be singling out the altar because it is the most exposed sancta and within reach of the laity.55 The tent and its furniture are relatively more insulated from contact and thus can simply be called "holy" without further qualification. Nonetheless, although this explanation helps, it does not account for all of the inconsistencies. For example, incense is dubbed "most holy" and "holy" in back- to-back verses (Exod 30:36-37). It would then seem that the terminology is not fixed and must be examined on a case-by-case basis.56 In this instance, it is possible that, since v. 36 has called incense "most holy," there is no need to repeat the most holy label in the following verse. More broadly, it would seem that since everything 53 Theoretical or comparative works from the history of religions may be fruitfully applied to the Priestly texts. For the notion of holiness and its dangers, see, e.g., Otto, Idea of the Holy ; and Mircea Eliade, The Sacred and the Profane: The Nature of Religion (trans. Willard R. Trask; London: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1959). For ritual as performance, see, e.g., Victor Turner, From Ritual to Theatre: The Human Seriousness of Play (Performance Studies Series 1; New York: Performing Arts Journal Publications, 1982). For the possibility of ritual failure, see, e.g., When Rituals Go Wrong: Mistakes, Failure, and the Dynamics of Ritual (ed. Ute Híisken; SHR 115; Leiden: Brill, 2007). 54 See Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 395. 55 Ibid., 443. 56 See Haran, Temples and Temple Service , 172 n. 50; Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 320-21; Jenson, Graded Holiness , 91-92.</page><page sequence="18">766 Journal of Biblical Literature 132, no. 4 (2013) within the divine sphere falls under the general category "holy," the Priestly writers can choose how specific they want to be.57 The Case of Leviticus 16 Leviticus 16 is anomalous in its use of terms, especially when referring to the outer and inner sanctuaries as the "tent of meeting" and the "holy place," respec- tively. Perhaps, as Milgrom suggests, the Priestly writers are incorporating an ear- lier account with different terminology.58 Or, reading synchronically, we may simply assume that since both occupy most holy space, the Priestly writers may choose to use a different comparative to differentiate them, this time opting for the tent of meeting and the holy place instead of holy and most holy. This also raises the issue of the compositional history of P, which has not been broached in this article but may help to explain the terminological inconsistencies.59 The Status of the Priests Finally, why are the anointed priests simply called "holy" when every anointed object is most holy? On a general level, as the logic of ritual indicates, anointing people and objects does not necessarily have the same effect.60 More practically, since individuals are given access to elements that are one degree holier than they are, priests need not be most holy to access most holy objects and spaces. Likewise, the high priest need not be most holy to access the "most" most holy elements; rather, he must only be more holy within the holy category than the priests. More than simply being practical, the priestly situation communicates an important mes- 57 See the various uses of the expression "the holy place" (Exod 28:29, 35; 29:30; 35:19, 39:41; cf. 28:43, which seems to refer to the area around the bronze altar), which may specifically refer to the outer sanctuary (so Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , e.g., 1063) or may refer more generally to the inside of the tent. 58 Milgrom, Leviticus 1-16 , 408, 1013, 1063. 59 For example, Nihan (Priestly Torah , 132-33) contends that all references to the bronze altar as most holy are later additions (Exod 29:37; 30:28-29; 40:10). 60 See, e.g., David I. Kertzer, Ritual, Politics , and Power (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1988), 11; Roy E. Gane, Cult and Character: Purification Offerings, Day of Atonement and Theodicy (Winona Lake, IN: Eisenbrauns, 2005), 8; Hundley, Keeping Heaven, 22-24. Location also could be a determining factor. If proximity to the deity (i.e., location) separates the most holy from the holy, and if the priests are not defined by location, it is thus possible that priests could never be more than holy. However, this perspective does not clearly account for the most holy bronze altar, which stands in the midst of holy space and is not closer to the deity than the holy space in the court between it and the tent. In addition, although not strictly defined by location, the priests are nonetheless defined by their access to privileged locations. Indeed, it seems that rather than location, anointing is the primary mark of the most holy sphere (Exod 30:26-29). As priests too are anointed, the fact that they are not most holy remains an anomaly.</page><page sequence="19">Hundley : Sacred Spaces , Objects, Offerings , and People 161 sage, stressing the unnaturalness, importance, and danger of their access. Although they have been elevated to holy status, they still do not really belong in the divine sphere; their access to the most holy is a necessary and unmerited expedient. In addition, while the most holy elements are (fatally) contagious, contact with the priests is by no means lethal. Indeed, the very purpose of the priests is to mediate contact between human and divine. Thus, the "holy" priestly label may indicate their mediatorial role. Since people cannot contact the most holy and the (more than) most holy God cannot contact common people without killing them, holy priests provide the bridge. They share holiness with the divine sphere, anointing with the most holy divine sphere, and humanity with the people, and thus are the only ones who may safely interface between categories. In the end, despite these lingering questions, it would seem that Priestly con- ceptions of divine space, objects, and offerings fall into a fairly consistent hierarchy, differentiated by the descriptors "holy" and "most holy." In addition to marking hierarchical divisions, the descriptors serve to stress the privilege of access and the appropriate boundaries lest they be fatally transgressed.</page></plain_text>
