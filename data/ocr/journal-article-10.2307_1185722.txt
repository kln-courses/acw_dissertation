<plain_text><page sequence="1">Generative Adversity: Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda in Tracks and Love Medicine Kate McCafferty We're neither of us bad guys; just adversaries, that's all. - James Welch, The Death offim Loney The shapeshifting of a human being into the form and consciousness of an animal - a "lower" category of being opposed to human status - has horrified and stymied the Western imagination for hundreds of years, as evidenced by European and colonial witch hunts and executions. But the fullest interpretation. of certain texts by Chippewa authors will only yield itself when we accept shapeshifting as part of the human repertoire. In fact the generatrix of the Chippewa world presents certain of its sacred faces in animal form and is a divinity that cannot be identified as a stable, static being, but rather through the distinctive interplay of its shapeshifting components. Such a kinetic sacred- ness - not metaphor but lived experience, not subject but activity - challenges the very basis of Western ontology and epistemology in a valuable and productive manner. Throughout Tracks and continuing in Love Medicine, Louise Erdrich invites us to observe the generative consequences of certain sacred Chippewa practices when applied to Roman Catholicism (and vice versa). Erdrich's character Pauline/ Leopolda, a woman peripheralized by her traditional Chippewa community since childhood, is the complex focus of this study. The convent, locus of the highest institutionalized power available to Catholic women, legitimates Pauline, provides her access to a powerful manitou, and affords her a new identity through which she can apply Chippewa shamanic practices to Eurocentric dogma. This dogma in turn both obscures and protects the continuation of the indigenous practices in question, although sometimes problematically. Pauline develops into a powerful shaman through personal means, such as vision and dream, as well as through interactive practice with other principal players in Tracks and Love Medicine. Fundamental to a fuller understanding of her role is a preliminary discussion of various elements of traditional Chippewa cosmology. The Chippewa, central Algonquin people who migrated westward to the forests of the Great Lakes region' long before the white incursion, live Kate McCafferty was an assistant professor in humanistic studies at the University of Wisconsin but is now working full time on two books.

Also known as Ojibway (Ojibwe) and Anishnaabeg (Anishnabe), this group includes the Cree, Salteaux, and Ottawa people. With care to avoid conflating the diverse cosmological views of distinct tribal groups, this study will follow the practice of anthropologist Theresa S. Smith in elucidating material available on Chippewa culture with anthropological accounts of Menominee cosmology. As Smith writes, the Menominee, Cree, and Potawatomi "share a similar geographic distribution and many common cultural/religious elements."2 All such informa- tion introduced below is meant to amplify possible readings of Erdrich's texts rather than narrow their aperture by assigning a single, fixed meaning. Rather than discuss their traditional "religion," many contemporary Chip- pewa speak in terms of medicine. In Two Cultures Meet: Pathways for American Indians to Medicine, Ojibway tribal member Larry P. Aitken explains that while the West fragments discrete "disciplines," Native American "medicine" is really an interdisciplinary network of religion, philosophy, spirituality, health care, psychology, ecology, natural history, and more. In the indigenous context, medicine is a way of life. As such, health care, spirituality, the physical world, intellectual capability, and emotional strength are important components, but still only a part of the main source or matrix. Aitken writes, "The main source [of Chippewa medicine] originates from a spiritual sense which reaches out like a web and connects everything. . . . It connects all the fibers of life ... our codes of conduct, i.e., how people relate to one another and to all that live on this earth" (35). The Chippewa earth is traditionally conceived of as an island in itself, floating in a round, illimitable ocean. Earth divides this ocean in half, into upper and lower portions. Although the Jesuits and early anthropologists (Hoff- man 1896, Skinner 1921) interpreted the upper portion of the Chippewa universe as belonging to exclusively benevolent spirits and the lower to malevo- lent, these were predictable Eurocentric overlays onto a system in which good and bad are not static locations, but positions in constant creative interplay. Recently, Benton-Benai, a resident of Manitoulin Island, informed anthropolo- gist Theresa S. Smith: "Earth is a place and time that hangs between eight levels of elements. These elements are unseen but are as real and necessary for life as the water you drink [and] four are above the earth and four are below the earth" (47). Smith writes that the three main divisions of Chippewa space consist of four layers of sky realm, the earth plane, and the realm of the underworld. These layers are traditionally governed by various manitouk. The manitouk (manitou) have been defined by Ruth Landes in Ojibway Religion as "the power beings on whom Chippewan personal lives depend" (3). Smith locates the usual residences of various manitouk in the following manner: Kitche Manitou, whom "[c]ontemporary Ojibwes view ... as interchangeable with the Christian god," 730 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="3">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda surmounts "the field of the sky" and is ogimaa, or boss, of the heavens (44- 45).3 Also among the upper four layers live the Thunderbirds, the Ningobianong (Evening Star), the winds, and other birds. Louise Spindler, who worked extensively with the neighboring Menominee, provides a detailed map of the eight cosmic tiers, reporting that the sun is the most prominent "face" of the sacred in the highest tier. Spindler wrote: Beneath the highest tier, and in descending order are 1) the Thunder- birds, gods of war, and the Morning Star, 2) the Golden Eagle and the White Swan, and 3) birds of other species, headed by the bald eagles. Beneath the earth and in the lowest tier is the Great White Bear with a copper tail who is purported to be the traditional ancestor of the Menominee tribe and is the main power for evil. The Great Underground Panther comes next in ascending order .... Then comes the White Deer, who is important in the Medicine Dance. And finally, is the Horned Hairy Serpent ... who inhabits the lakes and streams and tries to capsize boats in order to drag people to the Underground Place. (711) This Underwater Serpent, whose realm lies between earth and the land of the dead, is known to both the Chippewa and Menominee as Mishebeshu or Mishepeshu. The spirits of the eight tiers are not vertically ranked as "good" or "bad" by the Chippewa, nor are they relegated to the space of their abodes: rather, the "manitouk, like the Anishnaabeg, traveled frequently, but . .. according to their own rhythms" (Smith, 45). What is natural, then, in the Chippewa world, is that all beings - disem- bodied forces like the winds, animal powers, the dead, the culture hero Nanabush, humans - can and do transverse boundaries and planes. Traditionalists among the Chippewa sought and continue to seek such travel, with the help of "complex sacred bundles" which contain appro- priate medicines, as well as through "ritual, song, and reverence." Depending on the practitioner's application of evocative tools, the forces which then align can be conjured for either "good or harm." (Spindler, 712) While relatively few Chippewa dedicate themselves to the rigors of sha- manism, a range of twentieth-century anthropologists have noted the necessity of the relationships between every individual and various spirit powers from the eight tiers of the universe. Landes writes that the Ojibway are "profoundly religious" and see "life as a personalized Mystery" (3), while Smith states that there are two foundational categories essential to understanding the Chippewa American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 731</page><page sequence="4">Kate McCafferty world: "the multileveled nature of the Ojibwe cosmos and the experience of all reality as 'personal' " (44). The traditional imperative for each individual to form strong bonds with mentors from the eight universal tiers, as well as within the human community, cannot be underestimated. But the roles of beings who inhabit the diverse realms, as well as certain human roles necessary to the wholeness of a social group, are at times adversarial to each other by nature. Over thirty years ago, Ruth Landes learned in her work with the Chippewa that the role of shaman is fundamentally ambivalent and socially problematic. In a power-seeking process through which people who received visions "turned away from simple warm relations with their kind, partly because of the new manitou intimacy, partly because the visions had to be kept secret (or the manitou will leave you)," the visionary-practitioner estranged him/herself from the human collective in many ways (9). Landes wrote that "the great or 'evil' shamans were those who had sprung high on secret visions bred of proper fears. [These] powerful evil shamans [who] were feared as sorcerers hurt and killed until eventually they were destroyed by their own success" (9). Landes was informed that " 'good' shamans were much less respected" (9). Anthropologist/folklorist Victor Barnouw confirms in Wisconsin Chippewa Myths and Tales that ambivalent attitudes were felt toward members of the community who worked with supernatural powers, for such powers could be enlisted for good or for evil. Barnouw learned that "a shaman cures people, but he may also kill others through sorcery. An animal which is normally feared may act as a benevolent guardian spirit. . . ." For example, "owls are associated with death and with sorcery, since evil old men may take the shape of owls." Yet in one story in the collection, "a guardian owl wraps its wings about the hero to keep him warm on a winter night" (254). In this manner, the "good" an entity does for its affiliate may mean "evil" for someone else. In the complex Chippewa force-field, characterized by active creative-destructive conflict between all types of beings, it follows that "the fundamental relationships that existed between [people] and the supernatural can only be understood in terms of power and power gaining" (Spindler, 714). The implications of coercive control over the thoughts, relations, and labor of others that attach to the Western concept of "power" do not translate laterally into Chippewa, where power is traditionally seen as a life force itself. Power was and is not an individual possession, such as charisma, but rather a kinetic alignment between a number of entities from various layers of the sacred universe. Regarding power, Landes wrote that the Chippewa held life as full of "risky activity"; therefore, individuals "strove to locate the founts of mystery and contain them, for survival both on Earth, which they called an island, and in the ghost-phase . . after death" (3). If we briefly consider traditional Chippewa social organization and attempt to understand how supernatural power relations fit into its context, we can perhaps also read Pauline/Leopolda through a clearer lens. In the 1930s the 732 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="5">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda anthropologist Felix M. Keesing noted that the "Menomini 'family' was a larger and more inclusive kinship group than that typical of modern white society, and appears to have been the basic unit of economic life and effort" (42). Likewise, extended Chippewa family groups banded together to meet affectional and material needs (Barnouw, 7). Each small extended family band, as the basic unit of society, limited itself to a specific forest/waterway area so that hunting, fishing, and harvest crops, such as wild rice and berries, would not become depleted. Group hunts for bison did bring together a larger collective on a fairly regular basis. However, in terms of warfare, although the southern Chippewa were open to attack from Sioux peoples, Chippewa lands were, for the most part, geographically protected from both white and Iroquois incursions until the acceleration of the fur trade. Therefore a coalition of all groups for purposes of war was not often required, and a strong central chiefdom was not customary. Responding to this absence of a central and hierarchal authority, the Jesuit Allouez marked that "the Menomini [are] a people who have neither laws, nor police, nor magistrates to check disorder" (Keesing, 40), while Perrot, the first fur trader to journal Native American contact, wrote: "The savage does not know what it is to obey.... The father does not exercise authority over his son, nor does the chief dare to give command to his soldier" (Keesing, 40). Although Perrot criticized a lack of civil structures, in a later section of his Memoirs he exhibits a clear understanding of the motivation for cooperation and self-control among the Algonquin people he observed. The Harmony which subsists among the savages is in truth displayed not only by their words, but in their actual conduct. The chiefs who are the most influential and well-to-do are on equal footing with the poorest.... They warmly support and take in hand the cause of one another among friends; and when there are any disputes they proceed therein with great moderation. (Keesing, 41) Traditionally, then, the Chippewa created a system in which individuals lived in extended families or bands of families. They came together with other groupings for material purposes, such as hunting and occasionally warfare, as well as to participate in sacred societies and ceremonies. While not "individualistic" in the Western sense (i.e., believing that the interests of a single human being, in contrast with a social group or class, are ethically paramount), the Chippewa group encouraged an interactive flow of relationships between individual humans, animals, animal-faced clan guardians, spirits of the land, the dead, and the sacred individuals from the eight cosmic tiers. Hence Chippewa social organization was merely one important arena of interaction. For the strongest of shamans, if we can rely on Landes' information, it was not necessarily the most important one. Within a human society in which cooperation and complementarity, rather American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 733</page><page sequence="6">Kate McCafferty than coercive authority, were highly valued, power alliances across the eight tiers of the world were sought by the individual from early childhood. Young boys quested for vision. According to Landes, voluntary starvation "goads the desired vision" and attracts the pity of the manitou (8). Girls waited for the same in their first menstrual seclusion lodge. Beyond these rites of passage, Landes, Spindler, Smith, Barnouw, and Keesing refer to the centrality of the dream revelation in attracting powerful mentors. Parents also taught their chil- dren to fast, to blacken their face with charcoal (dead to human appearance), and to keep vigils in order to attract "supernatural" visitations from sacred beings or powers. Such powers usually embodied themselves in animal form. The individual brought dream and visionary revelations to band elders, known as Old Ones, for interpretation concerning "the future destiny of the individual in the sight of the Powers and of fellow tribesfolk, his or her rights or duties in the religious sphere, [and] fortunes for good or evil" (Keesing, 47). Keesing writes that among the neighboring Menominee, the "importance of individual dreams seems to have given a marked personal character to religion and ritual, on the one hand excluding the possibility of developing highly institutionalized religious forms and on the other giving a potential of variation that was to be significant in the course of modern change" (47). Such perceptions as Keesing's help clarify that it was not "individualism," but the responsibility of every individual to her or his world, that encouraged the engagement between human, non-human, and superhuman allies. Through maintenance of kindred relations with such allies on dream, vision, and ceremo- nial planes, a resistance to Western religious imperialism and a flexible means of propagation of traditional Chippewa sacred ways were established. All life forms are essential to the great round of life, or else they would not have been created. Because the diverse beings who reside across the eight tiers of the earth embody varying powers (as do the human dead), and because the continuous conflict between "good" and "evil" is desirably holistic (it can never be eradicated if creation is to remain a current activity rather than a past event), the seeker of power is apt to accept alliance with the form of power that chooses him or her. To an extent, the character of the guardian will affect the destiny of the individual; its powers, behaviors, temperament, and desires lie in certain directions and are transferred to the human partner. For example, we have learned that the Great Horned Serpent resides in waters, trying to pull people down to the "Underground Place," while Thunderbirds are the spirits of friction, change, and war, and Owl is the harbinger of death. But the human-spirit alliance is not hierarchal. That is, the human is not a hostage to the sacred but rather an affine. This is a sought after, rather than an imposed, relationship; both the human and non-human spirits are mutually seeking an ally with whom to travel. Therefore the human's ethos, experience, and purpose also factor into the mutual attraction and ultimately influence the face and focus of the power that presents itself. 734 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="7">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda Both Chippewa and Menominee traditions report regular interchanges between beings in different physical forms. According to Aitken: The Great Spirit is the source of the spirit of all else. And because the spirit of each is also part of the same spirit that lives in everything, having the same origin, being just a little bit of the same spirit, it is likely that all spirits can communicate ... because coming from the same origin they "speak the same language." (37) Thus recognizing an invisible relatedness, the spirits of diverse beings can unite to take each other on "cross-cultural" journeys. Communication through a common language and merging with a human body are common ways in which the spirit of an animal guardian can walk and work on the human plane. At the same time, a human can expand his or her abilities into other realms of power, such as aqueous existence, flight, night vision, and superhuman strength. This merging of human and animal forms is known as shapeshifting. Shapeshift- ing requires, among other things, surrendering one's exclusively human nature, which is characterized by analytic thought. Certainly in Chippewa tradition, each life form has its "unique manner of existence - its essence, its spirit that makes it what it is" (Aitken, 35). But all are interconnected in kinship (shared substance) through their matrix, the Great Spirit Creator. In 1939, Keesing noted that "just as the original totemic spirit beings metamorphosed into man, so it was believed that humans could change into, or marry, animals and vice versa" (45). Fifty years later Aitken reports that Chippewa elders still urge younger people to "trade places." "The Old Ones say there will be those people who will laugh at us, because we trade places with a flower or a tree" (36-37). Hence we see that interdependent power mergers have traditionally been sought (and continue to be sought) between the Chippewa and other life forms. Such powers, embodied in non-human life forms, may accrue through clan totems, societal memberships, dreams, vision- seeking experiences, or they may be inherited from departed relatives. In addition to non-human guardians, "a small child may be a powerful reincarnated elder, whose power must be protected" (Spindler, 715). Aitken concurs with Spindler's research concerning reincarnation, saying that so called mainstream Americans: ... think sometimes that we are locked into our human element that holds us within limits. It is really difficult for people to understand that when someone leaves their physical existence, a spirit remains behind, and one's spirit may be revived and relived someday in another form, in the hereafter, the above, the below, or wherever. Here is where we differ from Christian theology .... We must accept the possibility of reincarnation of the spirit in different forms. (Aitken, 37) American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 735</page><page sequence="8">Kate McCafferty Through this process, undying spirits, passing from form to form, may return special perspectives and abilities to the human realm. Among the Chippewa, three formal avenues of medicine practice have traditionally been sought: those of the Midewiwin, the Je'sako, and the Wa'bano. The Midewiwin, or Medicine Lodge Society,4 is the first formal option for Chippewa participation with what Westerners define as "supernatural" powers. Its ritual and beliefs remain the core of Chippewa/Menominee medicine today. At one time, membership was available to all through invitation or inheritance of a medicine bag (Spindler, 715); however, Aitken informs us that contemporary membership is limited to those who speak the Ojibway language fluently, for a "literal interpretation of word definitions alone does not lead to understand- ing .... There's a feeling, there's an essence that goes with our language, and you don't even have to change body expression, or talk with body language; just the words themselves convey the meaning" (22). For one poetic example, the Ojibway term "si-si-gwa-d" embodies its own meaning, for it mimics the "sound of wind in the trees," its definition in English. We may conjecture that such linguistic particularities mean to respect, if not to invoke, the "common language" between diverse beings which Aitken refers to. Spindler, Keesing, Barnouw, Landes, and others present details of Mide- wiwin ceremonies observed by Whites and explain them to some extent with the assistance of tribal members. A discussion of the Midewiwin is not pertinent to this study. Suffice it to say that according to Spindler, members of the Medicine Lodge declare their intention to come together to ensure the long life and good health of its members, and that "all medicines and power were declared to be benevolent and protective" in ritual application (716). A second recognized means for directing a coalition of human/guardian powers has been practiced by medicine men and women known as jugglers, or Je'sako.5 In The Role of Conjuring in Salteaux Society, Hallowell points out the importance of this practice, stating that "references to conjuring by means of the 'shaking tent' are scattered throughout the literature on Algonkian tribes of the Eastern Woodlands over a span of more than three centuries" (ix). The Je'sako, or tent shaker, "summoned spirits into ajizikun, a barrel-shaped struc- ture covered with hides or blankets. The spirits were asked to give information and advice about problem situations" (Barnouw, 9). Spindler writes that jugglers were diviners and doctors of great power who entered small birchbark lodges to implore the spirits to heal the sick. "The lodge swayed from side to side ... wind was heard and voices spoke to the seer" (715). The Je'sako practitioner worked to determine the cause of a patient's illness (usually witchcraft), enact a cure with the help of affiliated spirits, and enable the return of the soul to the body. From this information, we note that both Midewiwin and Je'sako rites were organized around the intent to create, maintain, or restore harmony and health to one's people. In Western terms, these are forms of "good" medicine. However, 736 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="9">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda in keeping with the Chippewa dynamic of continuous conflict between "good" and "evil," a third option existed for medicine practice through a small, elite order - the wa'anows, or Wa'bano. Information on Wa'banos, while sketchy, is essential to our reading of Erdrich's figure, Pauline. We learn from Menominee Patricia K. Ourada that the Wa'bano were a cult of "prophets, who derived skills from the Morning Star" (6-7), while Kessing writes: The "witches" seem to have worked more or less entirely as individuals, and probably represent the older Indian religion back of the Mitawin [Midewiwin]. [They] could change shape, make themselves invisible, steal the luck of hunters, and dispatch objects or spirits into the bodies of their victims at will. (50) Spindler adds to this information by stating that "the wa'anows... were said to be able to furnish hunting medicine, prescribe herbal remedies, and sell love powders and charms that would cause an indifferent person to fall in love with the owner" (715). And Landes, in Ojibway Religion, links ritual cannibalism to the human affiliation with windigo (cannibalistic skeletal forces), directly stating that as members of the witches society, wa'panows were "said to perform special cannibalistic rites" (8). The Wa'bano society was reported to have had eight members, "four using the Bear as tutelary spirit, and four using the Owl" (Spindler, 715). While Je'sakos may also have been considered witches, we have seen that their work was restorative - that of divination and healing. However, in 1896 Hoffman's informants related that Wa'banos, under the guidance of the Morning Star, were engaged in practices known only to "evil spirits [who] favor the shamans' desires" (Spindler, 717). Skinner, in 1921, collected the first data on the witches society. He claimed that his native informant described witches as: ... persons who have obtained the patronage of some evil power, in return for which they are able to slay relatives as votive offerings. They are able to transform themselves into balls of fire, owls, bears . . . and other animals, and can travel with great speed at night. (Spindler, 717) Skinner noted, too, the cannibalistic rites of the eight-member witch society, in particular the robbing of the heart and lungs of victims from the graveyard. Keesing, in 1939, and Hilger, in 1960, collected information about the same beliefs among traditional Chippewa and Menominee. A frequent topic of both Chippewa and Menominee traditional literature is the struggle between a wa'bano and a culture hero, such as White Rabbit or Nanabush.6 Through such literature we get a glimpse again of a particularly non-Western sense of power. Personal power among the Chippewa does not American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 737</page><page sequence="10">Kate McCafferty always appear in those with secular might. While great hunters and shamans were known to possess plenty of it, one could never tell if the most unlikely layperson was involved with a potent guardian. Hence miscalculation of power forms the basis of many tales (Barnouw, 8). The battle of wit, strength, and stamina, in which players develop, test, and prove their powers time and again, demonstrates a shifting and often adversarial nature to universal power align- ments, resulting either in health and good fortune or in disease and death. Defeat for any player in a given situation is seen as an indication of the present natural order - an order whose very nature is, in turn, based on continual change. Spindler explains: In a struggle between a great mete'w and a wa'panow, one of the central figures admits that his power is not strong enough to withstand that of the other, and so gives in without further contest. If he loses a struggle or if life turns against him, it is not so much that he is weak or defective; it is because his power is insufficient. (Spindler, 718) When we turn to the study of Pauline/Leopolda with this background in certain tenants of sacred Chippewa cosmology and some understanding of how that cosmology is actively practiced in the context of traditional social organization, we are better prepared to explore which traditional Chippewa principles are alive and well, embedded in Pauline's vernacular practice of Catholicism. For in Tracks, and briefly in Love Medicine, the triad of traditional medicine ways discussed above thrives and conflicts, through the personae of Nanapush, Fleur Pillager, and Pauline Puyat. Old Nanapush, whose verbal imprints alternate with those of Pauline throughout Tracks, can be seen as a Midewiwin priest of the old tradition. He demonstrates characteristic Midewiwin behavior when he blackens his face to seek counsel in dreams, shapeshifts to guide Eli on the hunt, and draws on a wide repertoire of power songs to sing a burnt child back to health. He stores a treasure of medicine bags under his bed and calls on spirit helpers through drumming. In Midewiwin practice "it is crucial that a man obtain supernatural power ... [by] petitioning the spirits through the sacred drum and the ritual related to it" (Spindler).7 While Moses Pillager appears to be the "drum owner" in Tracks, the role of "drum keeper" of the ni. mehetwin (drum dance organization) belongs to Nanapush. This is in keeping with the practice of entrusting an older man to act as the "authority on proper ritual ... he is supposed to look out 'like a father' for the people of the Society and their families" (Spindler, 716). Like a father, Nanapush looks after the dying Pillager family, their surviving daughter Fleur, and later on, her own small family. It is he who stores the drum in its sacred wrappings and keeps the lantern lit by it at night. During the Midewiwin song service, it is the custom that when drumming, 738 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="11">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda singing, or praying is not going on, someone is speaking (Spindler, 716). The verbal duties of the society's leadership include, according to Spindler: One of the old men exhorts all present to do the right things, which means that one should respect the rights of others, and not arouse antagonism, live quietly, observe the sacrifices required to maintain good relations with the sources of one's powers, and be modest, even- tempered, and guard against undue pride. (716) In Tracks, the figure Nanapush - both a cultural hero and a member of Pauline's living community - is a master orator, speaking so much on one occasion that death gets bored and passes by. This old man exhorts the reader through the medium of storytelling, in which time can be collapsed, aligning people across epochs - for the past, when spoken of in the present, is alive now. As is fitting for a man named after the trickster who brought language to the Chippewa, Nanapush is a master of verbal medicine. He demonstrates other shamanistic skills as an herb doctor, saving Lulu's legs from amputation. Also a sucking doctor, he is able to plunge his arms into boiling liquid or poisoned guts without harm. But he is Midewiwin in focus; he does these things as an agent of healing aligned with forces benevolent to his people. Tracks opens with Nanapush telling the story of a wave of influenza that swept the reservation and of finding the living flower (Fleur) surviving among the dead. Fleur, we learn, was born into the bear clan. In addition to his role as clan mentor, the bear holds a dialectically complex and potent position in the lives of traditional Chippewa, for he is at once an original ancestor, tutelary spirit of the witches' society, a source of vast vengeful energy, and a "brother" to humankind. But for clan members, the bear is a benevolent and protective force. For instance, when Fleur suffers complications during her first childbirth, a drunken female bear bursts into the cabin, lending her the fusion of fear and power she needs to finally expel the baby into the world. In addition to her clan guardian, we know Fleur is blessed with numerous benevolent relations with other superhuman beings. White Deer of the sacred tiers favors her so that she is able to predict the location of the deer before the hunt. When the hunter (her mate, Eli) acknowledges this survival gift by bringing her the heart of a deer, she eats the entire offering in one sitting. Erdrich also lets us know that a primary affine, if not Fleur's spirit lover, is Mishepeshu, the Great Horned Serpent, who dwells in the lake by her cabin. Mishepeshu can shapeshift into, among other things, the form of a beautiful man, with copper skin, green eyes, and "a mouth as tender as a child's" (T, 11). In fact, in his human manifestation he looks very much like Lulu, Fleur's firstborn. In keeping with the Chippewa ideal, Fleur maintains strong bonds with many powers from the different tiers that form the world, drawing from the American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 739</page><page sequence="12">Kate McCafferty unnamed and unformed as well as the animal-embodied. Her ancestral dead seek to protect her, as do the spirits of the forest, which she loves and guards from human encroachment. Although we do encounter Fleur involved in one bout of retaliatory sorcery (after Boy Lazarre cuts off the braids of her mother- in-law), in every other instance she practices power with no curse attached. In one particular situation when vengeance might be expected, she elects the way of the "tent shaker," Je'sako. But it is not a tent that shakes, rather the entire town of Argus, North Dakota, where Fleur is gang raped. On the morning after her violation, Fleur leaves town early. As she disappears, a tornado appears on the horizon. Years later, Pauline recalls that the wind blew, the men vanished from Kozka's Meats, and "the whole place was trembling as if a huge hand was pinched at the rafters, shaking it" (T, 27). Then the "old smokehouse Fleur had slept in [and was the scene of the rape] was crushed to a reddish sand" (T, 29). In his work with the Salteaux, the anthropologist Irving Hallowell was taught that "at the four cardinal directions live the 'masters' of the winds, anthropomorphic beings." Hallowell learned that in Jessakind, or tent shaking, "the masters of the winds are responsible for the [shaking] movements" (10- 11). It is these wind manitouk who take pity on Fleur when her human and animal relations are not able to come to her aid. True to the phases of tent-shaking tradition, "then we heard a cry building in the wind, faint at first, a whistle and then a shrill scream that tore through the walls ... and at last spoke plain" (T, 27). During the process of traditional shaking rites, the voices of the spirits come to advise. And true to the constructive commitment of the Je'sako, though Argus "fell apart and got turned upside down, smashed, and thoroughly wrecked," no one was hurt by the storm itself. On Fleur's part, "It was a fair-minded disaster" (T, 29). But Pauline hears the same winds advising murder. For as Nanapush would say, she had already convinced herself of "the other way" (T, 107). While Je'sako and Midewiwin practitioners aim to divine, protect, and heal, Pauline chooses Wa'bano, the medicine path of disease and death. Why? Erdrich clarifies the myriad of difficulties (and the culpability) that shape Pauline's behavior. Problems stemming from both native and mainstream expectations, physical and psychological propensities, and the mysterious resonance between an individual and its guardian spirits, work to "produce" Pauline as a contextual being. With Erdrich, we move backward as we move forward. That is, we are first exposed to the shamanistic culmination, Sister Leopolda, in Love Medicine (1984); but, we don't meet Pauline, from whom Leopolda develops, until Tracks (1988). The story Tracks begins in 1912. In that year Pauline is fifteen and working in Argus, North Dakota, in a butcher shop down the road from the reservation. But we know that she has been "off the res" for some time when 740 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="13">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda she tells us she has already had some schooling. Although she never speaks about her early school experience, we know that as early as 1875 a concerted movement was implemented to assimilate the woodland tribes through a formal and estrang- ing education based on Western civilization. Based on his work with the neighboring Menominee, Keesing writes that although the elders resisted, The removal of... children for most of the year from their home setting to one under full control by whites was perhaps the most potent move made up to this time [1876] by the government in its attempt to "civilize" the tribe. Numbers of the people speak of the boarding school as contributing the really destructive blow to old beliefs and customs. (175) The Roman Catholic Church undertook the preponderance of primary education in Chippewa country. By 1900, all Indian children were obliged to attend school through fourth grade. In the Christian institution of the boarding school, all students were under "an order ... put into effect prohibiting the use of the vernacular in Indian schools, so that all children had to learn English" (Keesing, 188). Educational assimilation was a clearly defined strategy with the agenda of cultural genocide. For example, in Shawano County, Wisconsin, an editorial in an 1882 newspaper declared that "the young Indian should be educated for his own sake, his family's sake, and that of the nation, particularly as it costs a hundred times less to educate him than to kill him, which is the only alternative that has ever been discovered" (Keesing, 190). Born only fifteen years after this pronouncement, a smart and sensitive character like Pauline Puyat must understand all too well that to be Indian in America is to be inferiorized, disadvantaged, and to exist in mortal danger. A mixed blood, she hopes to pass as white - "to be like my mother who showed her half-white . . . [or] my grandfather, pure Canadian" (T, 14). She tells her father, "I was made for better than the epidemic-ridden reservation.... Even as a child I saw that to hang back was to perish" (T, 14). But even though Pauline enters the school in the white town with dreams of learning the (white) lady's trade of lace-making from the nuns, she winds up sweeping the floor of a butcher shop. Can we dismiss Pauline as a grandiose, selfish adolescent, who sells her birthright for the delusion of mainstream, personal success? Not when we read her anxieties concerning estrangement from her family, most notably the womenfolk: "That winter we had no word from my family.... I had a dream I could not shake. I saw my mother and sisters ... buried too high to reach, wrapped in lace I never hooked" (T, 15). It is clear that she yearns for her family when she says, "I tried to stop myself from remembering what it was American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 741</page><page sequence="14">Kate McCafferty like to have companions, to have my mother and sisters around me." But, the band as kin is sorely missed as well: "When Fleur came to us that June, I remembered. I made excuses to work next to her, I questioned her" (T, 15). Ojibway scholar Larry P. Aitken tells us, "For any Indian, the greatest punishment is to be banished.... It was the loss of personal identity and of common ground with the nation that then resulted in personal loss of direction and purpose" (93). Although young Pauline dreams of escaping the imposed poverty and squalor of the reservation via a Western education, we see that her dreams are naive. In fact, the dual mainstream and Chippewa social ostracization cultivates such a terror of estrangement in her that years later she resists birthing her previously unwanted child, thinking, "If I gave birth I would be lonelier ." (T, 135). She decides to die rather than suffer this fate. But the midwife restrains her, pulling the child (Marie) out with forceps, and, against her will, "We were divided" (T, 136). Pauline's path as a multiply marginalized individual begins to diverge from that of the traditional family group in 1912 when she is orphaned. Paul Radin, in a study of the neighboring Winnebago, writes that "an orphan is not only a person of no social importance, but actually belongs to a lower social class" (75). (Dialectically, in Native American literature we sometimes read that the human-orphan status can also become the locus of extraordinary capabilities and supernatural strength.) But adding to her problems as an orphan, Pauline informs us that her family, never village luminaries, were "mixed-bloods, skinners in the clan for which the name was lost" (T, 14). In a society in which all members align from birth with powerful clan spirits, Pauline is doubly orphaned. As a child of fifteen years, with neither family nor clan totem mentors, she must face a world of lethal, shifting powers. Nanapush's narrative provides further information on how her Chippewa community viewed the child Pauline: "She was, to my mind, an unknown mixture of ingredients. ... We never knew what to call her, or where she fit, or what to think when she was around. So we tried to ignore her" (T, 39). Pauline's need to connect with powerful allies grows more and more urgent as she finds herself cut off from mainstream American success, birth family, clan, and acceptance by the larger Chippewa community. In fact, if a concerned elder were to observe this child during her early days in Argus, she or he might have noticed danger signals; for Pauline recalls that she was "fifteen, alone, and so poor-looking I was invisible" (T, 15). Survivors must work with what they've got. In which circumstances can Pauline turn being ignored and invisible to her advantage? At first, fading into corners, squeezing beneath a shelf unnoticed, she listens and watches. But eventually, peripheralized by every social group she encounters, she begins to develop the traits by which, in Chippewa culture, the evil shaman can be recognized. Landes' research from the 1960s informs us that the Ojibway recog- nized "traditional psychic disorders among themselves, overwhelmingly among 742 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="15">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda the 'evil' vision-empowered shamans," whose insanity was not seen as a personal aberration, but windigo - that is, brought on through communion with the skeletal cannibal forces mentioned earlier. Paraphrasing her tribal informants, Landes writes, "The windigo disorder involved projection of the sufferer's fears and vindictiveness ... from profound melancholy to violence [until] in the latter phase the sufferer yearned to kill and eat all human beings around" (13). In a parallel way Pauline, young and estranged, "grows" Wa'bano in opposi- tion to Fleur Pillager. In 1912, when Fleur comes to town to find a job at Kozka's Meats, the outcast Pauline becomes increasingly jealous of her tribes- woman's natural powers. Attributes are cited, such as Fleur's physical strength, her sexual magnetism, and her charisma. But most of all, Pauline resents Fleur's growing medicine power. This is reflected, for example, when she describes Fleur's "glossy braids ... like the tails of animals ... held-in and half tamed. But only half" (T, 18). Unlike the Whites, whose limited personal power does not allow them to read the magical signs of Fleur's body, Pauline sees the meaning behind the manifestation, explaining that "they were blinded, they were stupid, they only saw her in the flesh" (T, 18). At first, healthy respect, if not fear, keeps Pauline wary of crossing Fleur Pillager. But one night as the older girl carries Pauline to bed, she senses the "flaw" in Fleur's power. It is kind compassion. Armed with this knowledge, Pauline sets aside fear to become Fleur's "shadow" - "the shadow that could have saved her" (T, 22). Of course this is a dubious assertion. On the night that is a turning point in the lives of all involved, Fleur enrages the drunken butchers by beating them at cards. They follow her to the dark pigpen. Fleur, little Russell, even the huge sow, fight as best they can to keep the men away; but, the butchers win and they drag her off. Pauline tells us, "I should have gone to Fleur, saved her, thrown myself on Dutch.... [But] I closed my eyes and put my hands on my ears, so there is nothing more to describe but what I couldn't block out" (T, 26). Pauline's decisions related to the rape of Fleur Pillager begin her life's detour on the path of Wa'bano action. For while she hides in terror rather than risk an attempt to assist her tribeswoman, only hours later, Pauline locks three men in the coldhouse, committing her first vengeful murders. We read, thus, of childhood circumstances and experiences that mitigate in the direction of Wa'bano sorcery. In addition, Pauline's very physical appear- ance bears an uncanny likeness to KoKoKo the Owl, guardian of the Wa'bano and harbinger of death.8 Nanapush describes her at fifteen as a liar whose "eyes skimmed from wall to floor, never meeting anyone's glance, so anxious to be believed. Her brown hair poked in straggles around her ears. Her hands shook like ragged wings when her voice went high ... her voice screeched [but we] only stared as if she were a talking bird" (T, 53). Nanapush knows the habits of owls. He often finds the bodies of small animals eviscerated by predators out on the trap-line. Later, during the aborted American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 743</page><page sequence="16">Kate McCafferty healing ceremony for Fleur, he recalls that "the still look in Pauline's eyes made me wonder, so like a scavenger, a bird that lands only for its purpose. I saw those eyes on Fleur" (T, 189). And well over a decade later, when young Marie Lazarre decides to join the convent in Love Medicine, she describes the "big stark bony nose stuck to the front of [Pauline/Leopolda's] face" like a beak (LM, 43).9 "Her lips were a wounded brown, and her skin deadly pale. Her eye sockets were two deep lashless hollows in a taut skull" (LM, 46). The image of Owl, the "wounded brown" of the blood of its prey on its mouth, is vividly evoked. Later still, we hear the nun's laughter - "a dry cackle like leaves crushed underfoot" (LM, 117) - and that her hands are "claws." We are told that when she dies she will swirl off and be nothing (LM, 120). Moving from the physical to the psychic form of Pauline, we do well to remember Bakhtin's concept of a "double body" in which "one link joins the other; in which the life of one body is born from the death of the preceding, older one" (318). Erdrich points to Pauline's owlish inner life in many scenes, none more explicit than when she and Napolean Morrissey couple for the first time. Some sixth sense prevents Napolean from finishing what he started; silently he rises, dresses, and abandons Pauline in the deserted house, where she lies listening to the mice in the walls. She falls into a vision in which "we coupled in blinding darkness, moved too fast to think.... I snapped him in my beak like a wicket-boned mouse. He crushed me to a powder and spread me across the floor. Yet when morning invaded the empty windows and doors, we woke whole, unhurt, prepared for more pleasure" (T, 73). This aerial view of a love dance of pleasurable destruction is both "owl-like" in nature and indicative of a culture comfortable with reincarnation. Barnouw's Chippewa informants told him that "owls are associated with sorcery and death" (141), and "the owl is on the road to the other world" (142). Through her work on that road between the worlds, Pauline's bond with Owl is irrevocably forged. After her return from Argus to the reservation, she accompanies Bernadette Morrissey (who the nuns considered holy because of her work) on deathbed vigils. In a sense Pauline is entering a pre-convent novitiate as she brings living souls into the waiting hands of death. Then one night, on a sick-call to the house of an old classmate from the nun's school, Pauline tells us, "I was excited to be out in the moonless dark and Kokoko, the owl, floated off a branch like smoke and called" (T, 67). After the owl's summons, Pauline sits by her sick schoolmate and dreams her to death. The girl struggles to breathe. Pauline admits that she perhaps "could have drawn her back to shore," but she becomes convinced her patient wants to die. That is why "I put my fingers in the air between us, and I cut where the rope was frayed down to string" (T, 68). Immediately after this death, the first shapeshift- ing occurs. Pauline merges with her spirit protector, Owl. Standing up from the deathbed she suddenly feels light enough to rise into air: "I hooked my hands on a chair just to hold steady." Then blackness lifts her "out the room, 744 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="17">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda through the door." She explains: "I leapt, spun, landed at the edge of the clearing. My body rippled. I tore leaves off a branch and stuffed them into my mouth to smother laughter ... and that is when, twirling dizzily, my wings raked the air and I rose in three powerful beats and saw what lay below" (T, 68). From this vantage point, Pauline looks down on the world of mortals and finds them stupid. "I alone, watching, filled with breath, knew death as a form of grace" (T, 68). At dawn, Bernadette and the mourners are horrified to find Pauline hanging seven feet up in a tree that has no lower branches. But Pauline knows that "after I circled, studied, saw it all, I touched down on my favorite branch and tucked my head beneath the shelter of my wing. Then I slept, black and dreamless, beautifully complete" (T, 68-69). At last Pauline, previously lost without human and clan protectors, finds that she "had the merciful scavenger's heart" (T, 69). We have read that among the Chippewa, "evil" shamans (the Wa'bano) are considered to be in union with the windigo. It is this connection that drives them to sacrifice their relatives, to devour their hearts and lungs. In Tracks, when Fleur's second baby dies (due directly to Pauline's negligence), Pauline attempts to take the child's heart through baptism as an offering for her new "God"; but, Fleur knocks her to the ground. The infant's coffin is a shoebox, which the father lays to rest in the old way: "He tied the box with strands of his own hair high in the old growth of oaks, out of reach of anything that moved on the ground below. A mistake" (T, 163). A mistake indeed, for Pauline can shapeshift into Owl; she can literally rise above protection against anything that "moved on the ground." She swoops to scavenge her tiny relative during nocturnal flight, telling us, "I've read its name in the pattern of wet twigs. I've heard it crying to its father, the presence of the lake" (T, 163). For a number of reasons touched on earlier, Pauline turns to the church. Educated in Catholic school, feeling the power of its struggle against the old ways of her people, she disguises herself in piety and meekness a short time after Owl first presents itself. Keesing tells us that the Jesuits of the seventeenth century were graciously received by the Algonquin Indians, themselves long familiar with shifts in the shape of cosmic power. The overlap of practices such as fasting, seeking of spiritual mediators, similarities between medicine bags/ bundles and the paraphernalia of the mass, concepts of intense conflict between powerful universal forces, and the use of chanting and song, seemed to imply important similarities. The Jesuit "always moved in the rarified atmosphere of the supernatural." Keesing notes, "He came under the Indian category of sha- man" (80). A century and a half after Jesuit incursion, Pauline Puyat, driven by losses of history, epidemic, alienation, and her own behavior as "death's bony whore" (T, 86), walks again to a white town to join the convent which will function as both camouflage and surrogate. She transfers her overt devotional connection American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 745</page><page sequence="18">Kate McCafferty from the Chippewa Kokoko to the mainstream Christ in an act of cultural shapeshifting essential to her survival. For as she explains, Our Lord ... had obviously made the whites more shrewd, as they grew in number, all around, some even owning automobiles, while the Indians receded and coughed to death and drank. It was clear that Indians were not protected by the thing in the lake or by the other Manitous who lived in trees, the bush, or spirits of animals that were hunted so scarce they became discouraged and did not mate. There would have to come a turning, a gathering, another door. (T, 139) There is a short-term logic to this statement. What makes Pauline's behavior Wa'bano is the fact that she twists this critical historical and personal moment toward competitive self-aggrandizement in opposition to her tribe. Speaking about the new door that would have to open, Erdrich writes, "[A]nd it would be Pauline who opened it, same as she closed the Argus lockers. Not Fleur Pillager" (T, 139). At this point in the text, mounting evidence suggests that Pauline has lived, in one form or another, much longer than one human lifetime among the Chippewa. For example, in her dream of the "terrible night" of her human and animal relatives, she recalls the historic atrocity of the buffalo massacres of the preceding century and hears the groaning of a species that foresaw its own end. In addition, she sees "the people I had wrapped, the influenza and consumption dead whose hands I had folded ... taking a different road. A new road.... I saw their unborn children hanging limp or strapped to their backs" (T, 140). Watching those she has scavenged throughout the ages for death as they arrive at the manitou now shaped as Christ, she asks, "What shall I do now? I've brought you so many souls." And true to the nature of the cannibalistic windigo, "He said to me gently: 'Fetch more' " (T, 140). It is a common tactic that when a new religion takes root, the god or gods of the old faith become the devil of the new. This veiling of the god with the devil, and veiling of the devil with the god, is an oscillating operation we find in Erdrich's work. She suggests that the "new" god of Western society may be the shape that a much older power has shifted into. When Pauline takes the veil, she gains camouflage; veiling from the nuns is the fact that she is Indian. But from a certain Chippewa angle, the church's evangelical mission has veiled its own windigo desire to murder a culture in order to scavenge its heart. The bosom of the white community, with its contemporary disbelief in witchcraft, is therefore an ideal front for continued cosmic conflict. As a nun, Pauline continues to maintain a strong link with Owl and the qualities it embodies. She renews that bond with every death she attends, as well as with those she brings about. The connection is refreshed in other ways 746 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="19">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda as well, such as through interference with "good" tribal medicine. For example, after interrupting a ceremony intended to restore Fleur's health, Pauline blas- phemes a Midewiwin practice by plunging her hands into a boiling stew as an offering for her own guide. We know that Owl has accepted her offering when the final result of this scalding is the regrowth of skin on her hands that is "smooth and pink as a baby's, only tighter ... so that my fingers webbed and doubled over like a hatchling's claws" (T, 196). Then she went out; and, with those half-human, half-bird claws, found the superhuman strength to strangle Napoleon Morrissey to death with a rosary. But shapeshifting is a partnership. Just as Owl helps Pauline to feel the "peace" of life-and-death control over others, she helps him, in his new guise of Christ - a "weak" but "tame newcomer in this country that had its own devils in the waters of boiling-over kettles" (T, 192) - to toughen into an equal adversary for older, deeply rooted forms of power.10 Over and over they tumble, true affines mutually delighted by struggle and pain. Her supernatural mentor tortures and tricks her. Is he Christ or Lucifer, "the Light of the World?" (T, 193). Whichever, she lets us know that he is the essence of Owl when she says, "[Christ's] love is a hook sunk deep into our flesh." Like the talons of the owl in its prey, those claws, Pauline tells us, pierce in the form of "a question mark that pulls with every breath. Some can dull themselves to the barb's presence. I cannot" (T, 205). Not only do the Chippewa characters of Erdrich's tales set earlier in the twentieth century cross over between religious forms and practices, but a study conducted among Catholic Chippewa by J. Anthony Paredes in Minnesota during the 1980s reveals that contemporary interviewees were familiar with cures, tent-shaking ceremonies, and traveling fireballs. In general this indicates a belief in both the Indian and Catholic religions (Paredes, 217). Even more recently, native colleagues on Manitoulin Island informed T. S. Smith that Kitche Manitou, or the Great Spirit, is viewed by contemporary Ojibway "as largely interchangeable with the Christian god, and invocations and prayers are offered up to both" (45). A cross-over virtuoso, the character Pauline/Leopolda utilizes the Roman Catholic Church to expand a particular Chippewa medicine practice - Wa'bano witchery - in an act of inverse assimilation. As we close this discussion, we benefit by returning to a closer look at traditional Chippewa perspectives on death and afterlife. Early anthropologists and clerics reported that Native Americans in general resisted the simple binary opposition of "good" to "evil," or the perception of "evil" as a thing that could or should be completely eradicated from the world. Many tribal groups held (and continue to hold) a more complex view of evil as a component of every person, every god, and of life itself. Yet surely the Chippewa made, and continue to make, distinctions between what they consider "good" and "evil" sorcerers. In such assessments, the negative appears to be determined by the type of power or control exerted over another entity. While the "good" witches known as American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 747</page><page sequence="20">Kate McCafferty Midewiwin and Je'sako work to divine and cure, the Wa'bano traditionally have sought to dominate others in the service of disharmony and death and hence are considered "evil." Syllogistically, if bringing about death makes a medicine "evil," then death itself would seem to be the evil component. But Aitken states the traditional Ojibway premise that death is not what it appears to be because "spirit is never lost." "It has no physical essence" (37). In Tracks, Nanapush echoes this belief as he describes the forest that is about to fall on the heads of those who had come to violate it. "[A]II substance was illusion," he tells us. "Nothing was solid" (T, 223). Erdrich, through fiction, and Aitkin, in his pedagogical tract, present a modern traditionalist message concerning the ongoing, kinetic interconnected- ness between life forms. "One's spirit may be revived and relived someday in another form," states Aitken. "We must accept the possibility of reincarnation" (37). Reincarnation can be understood as a type of shapeshifting in which the spirit of one substance, in order to take action in this world (tier), embodies itself within a form not "native" to it. This is a form of metamorphosis. Myths around the world, as well as in Native American culture, bear witness to metamorphic reality. In a Chippewa example, Barnouw writes that for tribal storytelling, "A key concept, as we have seen, is the notion that visible forms are deceptive and that human and animal forms are interchangeable. A spirit may appear in either human or animal form" (247). Barnouw emphasizes that human-animal shapeshifting is not a trope or literary device. Rather it bespeaks the arbitrary nature of outward appearance (248). "Related to the interchangeability of human and animal form," he asserts, "is the reversibility of life and death. . . . The notion of return to life is implicit in the Midewiwin ceremony .... It is this belief which makes it possible for hunters to kill animals without guilt. Death is seen as only a temporary interruption" (252)." Clearly death is an interruption that few, Chippewa or otherwise, are eager to experience. Still, if death is only an interruption of life, a life going on concurrently along various tiers of existence; if children are sometimes reincar- nated elders or spirits; if life forms "trade places," and "new doors" to the power of life present themselves; then those whose hearts Owl eats will cycle back someday into the drama one way or another. The only death a Chippewa cannot recover from is drowning. Pauline and Nanapush agree on this, and no one Pauline "helps" into death dies in the water. In fact, alone on the lake, she challenges Mishepeshu to drown her and end her lives forever. But the Great Horned Serpent declines to put an end to her and the important role she plays in traditional adversarial-generative conflict. In 1983, Ojibway elder Ignatia Broker recorded an oral history for the benefit of children and grandchildren. In it she alludes to five generations of 748 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="21">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda Ojibway who will make a circle: "The first people will start the circle and the others will move away from the Ojibway ways. There will be those who will ask questions and those who remember, and the last generation will again act as the Ojibway have acted in years before. Then the circle will be closed" (8). Throughout Tracks and Love Medicine, we may read Pauline as an embodi- ment of the transition from the traditional "circle" of the Ojibway into the forced "move away." But beyond this paradigm, we may also see Pauline, as well as Fleur and Nanapush, as essential players through whom a timeless struggle is continued. That struggle is the sacred and willful creation of a dynamic balance in the world. The antagonism between shamanistic Midewiwin, Je'sako, and Wa'bano paths forms part of an ongoing cosmic drama. In Tracks and Love Medicine, Erdrich presents a comprehensive look at the types of situations and behaviors that attract certain affines (human, animal, ecological, philosophical, supernatural, institutional, etc.). Through Pauline we learn that rather than a powerful traditional medicine practice having been absorbed by a supposedly indomitable Western institution, the church has been absorbed - at the local level - by a power with which it is not at all equipped to deal. In one example that illustrates how adversity can generate cultural renewal, Broker recounts how the coughing sickness came upon the Chippewa during their second winter on reservation lands. This sickness had two effects. It killed; but, it also motivated the people to "practice the herb healing in secret. The will of the Ojibway was one again, and the tie to the old ways was strengthened" (Broker, 87). Through the fictional medium of Tracks we are invited to observe at least one generative component of Chippewa sorcery - the antagonistic actions of witchery serve to bring endangered people together. Protection is sought. Moral and ethical questions arise, questions that will cause some to remember how to "close the circle." Moving Pauline to the institutionalized core of the culture that allegedly devoured Chippewa reality, inverts and interrogates historical assumptions. At the same time that the church - the "civilizing" agent - attempts to assimilate Chippewa traditions, it is unwittingly and skillfully incorporated into a drama that has for ages motivated people to form human and supernatural alliances according to their deepest values. Witches are activators and instigators, and the negative forces they employ can impel important developments, like grains of sand in the flesh of an oyster. Fifty years ago, Paul Radin researched two distinct genres of traditional literature among the Winnebago, another woodlands tribe. Radin was taught the differences between the waikq, in which actors are always of divine origin and time, and the worak, in which the actors are human, the time is set within human memory, and the tone of which is always tragic. His research indicates that "the transformation of the waikq into the worak has, apparently, been brought about by introducing a human hero and having the action transferred American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4) 749</page><page sequence="22">Kate McCafferty from the mythical, to the present human, era" (76). This example resembles a widely held Chippewa understanding and common literary practice. When discussing the cultural hero Nanapush with Theresa Smith, the noted de-ba- jeh-mu-jig (storyteller) of Manitoulin Island, Blake Debassige, said, "Who can say who [he] is? There are so many variations ... he's got a smirk on his face and you don't know what he's gonna do next. And I see that in a lot of people ... and it's alive, it's here with us today" (Smith, 30). In a feat of literary shapeshifting, Erdrich seems to have created such a transformation. Presenting ancient cosmological struggles as embodied by human personae in historical time (rather than speaking, for instance, of the generative cosmic conflict between Owl and Mishepeshu), she allows "ordinary" people to identify with relevant ethnical power struggles and to develop value-based empathy. By making the mythic - which operates on an eternal, vertical axis rather than across horizontal time - a personally meaningful experience and by demonstrating the closeness of all life forms through the practice of shapeshifting, Erdrich herself accepts for a time something like the role of Nanabush - he who brought language to the people, then instructed them in the right order of the sacred on behalf of his "elder brothers," the manitouk. All of them. Notes 1. The Turtle Mountain Band resides traditionally on the Great Plains. 2. For example, the Menominee and the Chippewa share the precise name, as well as legends of, the rabbit-trickster Nanabush, brother to the manitou and bringer of language and social structure to both groups of human beings. 3. T. S. Smith's work alludes to the ongoing interplay of Chippewa and Christian cosmologies when she writes, "Even the name Kitche Manitou was not invariably reserved for one Great Spirit. As Kohl relates: 'An old Indian with whom I once talked, told me that there were six Kitche- Manitous. One lived in the heavens, one in the water, and the other four north, south, east and west' (Kohl [1860] 1985, 60)" (46). 4. Midewiwin is literally translated as "mystic doings" (Landes, 3). 5. According to Landes, great self-esteem was offered to shamans who "pursued magical formulas, philosophies, and techniques ... [especially] adept shamans [who were] believed to manipulate the manitou supernaturals as we do electricity!" (3). 6. Both tribes know this trickster figure, brother to the manitouk, by the same name. 7. The ni.mihetwan first came about when the Great Spirit gave a young Lakota girl the original drum and rituals. It was later embraced by other Plains and Great Lakes groups, according to Spindler. 8. As we examine Pauline's representative physicality, it is hard to avoid recalling Bakhtin's concept of the body as a fissure or entryway: "The potentiality of another way of life ... [which leads] men [sic] out of apparent (false) unity, or the indisputable and stable" (8). For if the Chippewa world depends on generative oscillations of power, then that world is served in the long run by Pauline, who shakes it out of its assumptions regarding the indisputable and stable. Her physicality embodies signs of Bakhtin's "fissure." 750 American Indian Quarterly / Fall 1997 / Vol. 21(4)</page><page sequence="23">Shapeshifting Pauline/Leopolda 9. Again, referring to the general richness found in Rabelais and His World, Bakhtin names the literary nose as a site for transformation of the human into the animal, or the "combination of human and animal traits [which] is, as we know, one of the most ancient grotesque forms" (36). For Bakhtin, the body-grotesque simultaneously contains death and renewal in a process of becoming. 10. According to Landes' work with Chippewa elders, it was a common occurrence for the mature shaman to feel so intimate with the affiliated manitou that he showed "the Supernaturals to be even sillier or weaker than he" (24). 11.
