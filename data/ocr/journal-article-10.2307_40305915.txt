E-mail: violeta.munoz@ebc.uu.se ABSTRACT Aim Limited population structure is predicted for vagile, generalist species, such as the grey wolf (Canis lupus L). Our aims were to study how genetic variability of grey wolves was distributed in an area comprising different habitats that lay within the potential dispersal range of an individual and to make inferences about the impact of ecology on population structure. Location British Columbia, Canada - which is characterized by a continuum of biogeoclimatic zones across which grey wolves are distributed - and adjacent areas in both Canada and Alaska, United States. Methods We obtained mitochondrial DNA control region sequences from grey wolves from across the province and integrated our genetic results with data on phenotype, behaviour and ecology (distance, habitat and prey composition). We also compared the genetic diversity and differentiation of British Columbia grey wolves with those of other North American wolf populations. Results We found strong genetic differentiation between adjacent populations of grey wolves from coastal and inland British Columbia. We show that the most likely factor explaining this differentiation is habitat discontinuity between the coastal and interior regions of British Columbia, as opposed to geographic distance or physical barriers to dispersal. We hypothesize that dispersing grey wolves select habitats similar to the one in which they were reared, and that this differentiation is maintained largely through behavioural mechanisms. Main conclusions The identification of strong genetic structure on a scale within the dispersing capabilities of an individual suggests that ecological factors are driving wolf differentiation in British Columbia. Coastal wolves are highly distinct and representative of a unique ecosystem, whereas inland British Columbia grey wolves are more similar to adjacent populations of wolves located in Alaska, Alberta and Northwest Territories. Given their unique ecological, morphological, behavioural and genetic characteristics, grey wolves of coastal British Columbia should be considered an Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU) and, consequently, warrant special conservation status. If ecology can drive differentiation in a highly mobile generalist such as the grey wolf, ecology probably drives differentiation in many other species as well.

INTRODUCTION Phylogeographic structure is a consequence of limited dispersal within the range of a species. Phylogeographic patterns may reflect isolation by distance, the presence of a barrier to dispersal (such as a geological feature or unsuitable habitat), historical events or a combination of these factors (Avise et al, 1987). Environmental and ecological variables (Doebeli &amp; 1516 wvwv.blackwellpublishinq.com/ibi doi: 1 0. 1 1 1 1/j. 1 365-2699.2008.02067.X © 2009 The Authors Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="2">Ecology drives wolf differentiation Dieckmann, 2003; Nosil et al, 2005; Funk et al, 2006) and social interactions (Bolnick et al, 2003) may also contribute to shaping population structure. A geographic range that includes a variety of habitats may result in individuals that are adapted to specific environmental and/or ecological factors (e.g. Hoekstra et al, 2005). Adaptation, in turn, can cause some degree of isolation if individuals have a higher probability of survival where they were born or reared (Nosil et al, 2005). Differential fitness can lead to a reduction in effective migration between habitats and generate genetic differentia- tion and population structure. Phylogeographic structure generated by natural (non-anthropomorphic) causes has been proposed to be of high conservation importance, as these may be the units upon which evolution acts, and thus may even occasionally represent incipient species (Moritz, 1994). To highlight the importance of these subspecific units, the term Evolutionary Significant Unit (ESU) has been coined (Ryder, 1986). Recently, the definition of ESU has been refined to highlight the importance that ecology and local adaptation play in evolution (Crandall et al, 2000; Fraser &amp; Bernatchez, 2001). Identifying ESUs is therefore of high importance both for understanding the evolutionary past of a species and for ensuring its future. Many large mammals have high dispersal capabilities and are distributed across a variety of habitats. An emerging literature shows that genetic differentiation in such mammals may be associated with ecological differences, and not solely with geographical distance. Examples include the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus; Dalén et al, 2005; but see Carmichael et al, 2007), cougar (Puma concolor; McRae et al, 2005), coyote (Canis latrans; Sacks et al, 2004), and lynx (Lynx lynx and L canadensis; Rueness et al, 2003a,b). Perhaps the most well- known example of divergent behaviour associated with eco- logical differences resulting in genetic structure is that between sympatric resident (fish-eating) and transient (marine mam- mal-eating) killer whales (Orcinus orca; Hoelzel et al, 1998). Quantifying the degree to which habitat drives genetic differentiation is important. If habitat specialization is a major factor driving and/or maintaining divergence, then in the absence of specific data it should be assumed that populations in different habitats are genetically differentiated, implying that when a specific habitat is threatened, a unique population, differentiated from populations of the same species in adjacent areas, is also threatened. Grey wolves (Canis lupus L.) are highly mobile carnivores that often disperse more than 100 km before breeding (Fritts, 1983; Merrill &amp; Mech, 2000; Linnell et al, 2005). Geological features that may be barriers to some species, such as mountain ranges, probably pose little obstacle to wolf move- ment, and may even act as corridors (Forbes &amp; Boyd, 1996). In addition to their vagility, grey wolves are ecosystem generalists, occupying a wide variety of habitats. In North America, they live in habitats as diverse as arctic tundra, boreal forests, plains, mountains, deserts and temperate rain forests. Because of these characteristics, little phylogeographic structure is expected in wolves. Indeed, early phylogeographic studies of world-wide and North American grey wolves supported this prediction, showing no large-scale structure within Eurasia or America (Lehman et al, 1991; Wayne et al, 1992; Vila et al, 1999). Studies employing more detailed sampling, however, have suggested that there may be genetic structure in grey wolf populations (Carmichael et al, 2001, 2007; Sharma et al, 2003; Geffen étal, 2004; Pilot étal, 2006; Musiani étal, 2007). Geffen et al (2004) reanalysed some previous studies on grey wolves in North America and identified a pattern of isolation associated with habitat and climate. On a finer scale, prey specialization may drive population structure in grey wolves from Northwest Territories, Canada (Musiani et al, 2007). Similarly, ecological factors such as prey distribution, habitat and climate were found to be correlated with popu- lation genetic differentiation in grey wolves of eastern Europe (Pilot et al, 2006). Coastal British Columbia wolves occupy a narrow region that includes mainland coast and near-shore island habitats covered by temperate rain forest that extend from Vancouver Island in the south to the Alexander Archipelago of south-east Alaska in the north (Fig. 1). Although urgency has been expressed in responding to imminent threats to biodiversity in this ecosystem, a paucity of scientific information exists to support the evolutionary importance of the region (Cook et al, 2001, 2006; Darimont &amp; Paquet, 2002; Paquet et al, 2004-2005). Recently, a study of south-east Alaskan wolves identified genetic divergence between interior and south- eastern Alaskan coastal wolves (Weckworth et al, 2005). This highlights the need to study the wolves of adjacent British Columbia, as the coastal rain forest of south-east Alaska extends south through British Columbia. The wolves of British Columbia, Canada, provide a good system in which to evaluate the effects of distance and habitat variation on population genetic structure because they are distributed across very different habitats on a scale within the dispersal distance of an individual (Fig. 1 and Table 1). An ecological discontinuity exists between interior and coastal regions, to the east and west of the Coast Mountain Range, respectively. The interior plateau areas are dry, with a continental climate (warm in summer, cold in winter). Eight species of ungulates, which vary in their distribution, are available as prey to inland wolves (Cowan &amp; Guiguet, 1975; Nagorsen, 1990; Shackleton, 1999) (Table 1). In contrast, the coastal region is defined by a low-elevation rain forest with a temperate climate (mild year-long). Only one ungulate species is distributed through- out the coast, the black- tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus; Cowan &amp; Guiguet, 1975; Nagorsen, 1990; Shackleton, 1999). This deer and marine resources, such as marine mammals and seasonally spawning salmon, constitute most of the diet of coastal wolves (Darimont et al, 2004, 2007, 2008). This variability in habitat exists over geographic distances at the scale of wolves' known dispersal ranges in western North America. Consequently, an individual could potentially encounter both coastal and inland habitats in the course of its natural dispersal. Journal of Biogeography 36, 1 5 1 6-1 53 1 1517 © 2009 The Authors.

In order to assess the degree of differentiation, and hence conservation importance, of British Columbia coastal and inland wolves, we obtained mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) control region sequences for animals from across the province and integrated our genetic results with data on phenotype, behaviour and ecology. MtDNA is an appropri- ate marker to use to examine the general population structure in wolves because dispersal is not sex-biased (Mech &amp; Boitani, 2003) and has been shown to correlate with differentiation at nuclear markers in other wolf populations (Pilot et al.y 2006; Musiani et al.y 2007). We also used these data to test the hypothesis that ecology drives genetic differentiation by assessing the co-variation of distance, habitat and prey composition with genetic differ- entiation. To place our results in perspective, we also compared the genetic diversity and differentiation of wolves from British Columbia with these measures in other North American populations. 1518 Journal of Biogeography 36, 1 5 1 6-1 53 1 © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="4">Ecology drives wolf differentiation MATERIALS AND METHODS Materials A total of 160 wolf mtDNA control region sequences from British Columbia were analysed in this study. Samples included faeces, blood, blood serum, hair, muscle, skin and teeth. Faeces (n = 43) were collected between 2000 and 2005 across the coastal region in areas we term Coast 1, Coast 2 and Coast 3 in this study (Fig. 1). High-quality samples including blood or blood serum, muscle, skin and hair (n = 46) were collected by taxidermists from legally hunted animals and by province officials from animals trapped for reasons other than this study; of these, five were from the coast. Tooth root samples (n = 71) from museum specimens collected between 1932 and 1989 were analysed to improve geographical coverage, particularly in interior areas (see Appendix SI in Supporting Information). For comparative analyses, samples from adjacent regions were included in this study. DNA from wolves from central Alaska was obtained from muscle samples from the University of Alaska frozen tissue collection (n = 20; Appendix SI) and the collection of R. K. Wayne (n = 11). Muscle samples from Alberta (n = 10) were obtained from the Alberta Environment Natural Resources Service, Canada. DNA from wolves from Inuvik (Northwest Territories) was obtained from the collec- tion of R. K. Wayne (n = 37). All sequences from R. K. Wayne's collection and Alberta were previously reported as unpublished data in Leonard et al (2005). Additional sequences for wolves from these three regions were obtained from the literature (Vila et al, 1999; Musiani et al, 2007). Molecular methods Faecal samples were handled and extracted in a dedicated faecal DNA laboratory. DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNA Stool Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) following the manufacturer's instructions with the addition of a one-hour digestion step. Tooth roots of museum specimens were cut, crushed and extracted in a separate dedicated low-quality- DNA laboratory. DNA extraction was performed following the Yang et al. (1998) protocol involving silica-based spin columns (QIAquick PCR purification kit; Qiagen) with some modifi- cations. Skin, blood, blood serum, hair and muscle samples were digested with proteinase K overnight at 37°C, and DNA was extracted using a standard phenol-chloroform extraction (Sambrook et al, 1989). A 425-base-pair (bp) fragment of the 5'-end of the mtDNA control region was amplified with the primers Thr-L (Vila etaU 1999) and DLHc (Leonard et aly 2002). DNA was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 25 -^L reactions containing lx Gold Buffer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA), 2.5 him MgCl2, 1 him dNTPs (0.25 mM each), 0.5 fiM each primer, 10-100 ng of genomic DNA and 1 U of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase (Applied Biosys- tems). PCRs were performed in a PTC-225 (MJ Research, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) thermal cycler with an initial denatur- ation step of 95°C for 5 min followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s and 72°C for 1 min; and a final extension of 72°C for 7 min. PCR negatives were included in all cases to monitor for potential contamination. Owing to the degraded nature of DNA in most of our samples (faeces and museum material), we included DNA negatives in all extractions that we carried through the PCRs to monitor for potential contamination. To control for errors caused by DNA damage and degradation, we sequenced each faecal and museum sample from at least two independent PCRs. In one sample of faeces and five samples of museum specimens, one or more mismatches were identified. These samples were sequenced from two additional independent PCRs. The consensus sequence, based on identity of all but one sequence, was used in analyses. PCR products were purified in 18-//L reactions containing 15 fil of PCR product, 12 U of Exonudease I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and 1.2 U of Shrimp Alkaline Phosphatase (USB Corporation, Staufen, Germany) incubated at 37°C for 15 min followed by 80°C for 15 min. Both strands of each PCR product were sequenced with the same primers as used for amplification, and then reaction products were separated in an automated sequencer (ABI 3730x1 DNA Analyzer; Applied Biosystems). Sequences from multiple PCRs were checked and edited using sequencher ver. 4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI, USA), and were then aligned by eye using se-al ver. 2.0all Carbon (Rambaut, 1996). In order to reduce the possibility of including multiple faecal samples from the same individual, we used information available as part of another study, consisting of complete and partial genotypes for 30 and four faecal samples, respectively, from coastal British Columbia (Leonard et al, in preparation). These results suggest that re-sampling of the same individual, even in the same locality, is very rare (two identical genotypes were identified twice in 34 samples). Based on these data, in some cases we were able to determine conclusively that multiple samples from the same locality corresponded to different individuals, and so all of these samples were included in our analyses. Otherwise, only one sample per sampling locality, each being typically at least 20 km from another, was included to reduce the risk of sampling the same individual multiple times. Exclusion of these samples resulted in the inclusion of 43 out of 67 good-quality sequences from faeces and in only one haplotype missed at one locality. One dog haplotype found in one faecal sample and one sequence found in two faecal samples that showed evidence of being a nuclear insertion (Numf) were excluded from all analyses. Data analyses To illustrate relationships among haplotypes, we constructed an unrooted parsimony network using tcs ver. 1.21 (Clement et al, 2000). For analyses of structure, samples were grouped based on geographical proximity (Fig. 1): Vancouver Island (n = 22), Journal of Biogeography 36, 1 5 1 6-1 53 1 1519 © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="5">V. Muhoz-Fuentes et al. Coast 1 (n = 16), Coast 2 (« = 16), Coast 3 (n = 16), Coast South (« = 5), Kechika (« = 28), Fort St John (« = 11), Interior Plateau (n - 26) and Cariboo/Rocky Mountains (« = 14). Because samples along the coast were distributed continuously and no geographic or topographic division is evident, we divided the samples into groups of equal size. Six samples were excluded from the British Columbia genetic structure analyses because they could neither be assigned to any group described above owing to the geographic distance separating them from other samples, nor form a group on their own because of their small sample size: Telegraph Creek, n = 3, in the north-west, and three samples in the south (Fig. 1). These samples were only included in the larger-scale analyses as part of inland British Columbia. We used the software samova ver. 1.0 (Dupanloup et a/., 2002) to uncover hierarchical groupings of localities and to identify genetic barriers to dispersal, samova determines the most probable genetic structure according to the number of groups entered by the user. We tested for genetic structure with K = 2 to K = 9 groups. We used 100 annealing processes and repeated the procedure twice to test for consistency. We chose the most probable Kas the one that maximized &lt;PCr (Dupanloup et al y 2002). To calculate pairwise &lt;PSr between the groups we used arlequin ver. 2.001 (Schneider et al, 2000). In both samova and arlequin, the significance of (^-statistics and the variance components were assessed using a permutation approach (Excoffier et al, 1992). We controlled for type I error in multiple comparisons using the method of Benjamini &amp; Hochberg (1995) (also see Verhoeven et al, 2005). To identify correlations between the genetic distance among the groups (as represented by pairwise &lt;PSt) and geographical distance or ecological variables (vegetation cover and prey composition) we used the software distlm ver. 5 and distlm forward ver. 1.3 (Anderson, 2001; McArdle &amp; Anderson, 2001). Habitat data were entered at two levels: (1) as either coastal or inland, representing the major ecological and environmental differences in British Columbia; and (2) in more detail as biogeoclimatic zone data representing vegetation, soils and climate (temperature and precipitation) (Pojar &amp; Meidinger, 1991) (see Table 1 for characterization of each sampling area). Prey composition was entered as common, rare or absent for the following ungulates: woodland caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou), elk (Cervus elaphus), mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus), moose (Alces alces), bighorn sheep (Ovis canad- ensis), DalPs sheep (Ovis dalli), black-tailed deer and white- tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) (Table 1). Genetic divergence between coastal and inland British Columbia wolves, between these two and other North American populations, and between coastal wolves and two recognized wolf subspecies was measured by calculating pairwise &lt;PSt between the groups as implemented in arlequin (see above). RESULTS We identified eight distinct haplotypes in 160 wolves from British Columbia (Fig. 2) defined by 11 variable sites in the 425-bp region we sequenced. These variable sites included 10 transitions (C-T, A-G) and one indel. One haplotype in the coastal wolves (Iu68) and one in the inland wolves (Iu67) had not been previously described. The six remaining haplotypes have been found elsewhere in North America (Vila et al, 1999; Leonard et al, 2005; Musiani étal, 2007; this paper) (Table 2). The most common haplotype was Iu38 (50% of the individuals analysed). Within British Columbia, the distribution of haplotypes suggested differentiation between wolves of coastal and interior areas. Haplotype Iu68 was absent in inland wolves, and haplotypes Iu28, Iu29, Iu31, Iu36 and Iu67 were absent in coastal wolves. Only two haplotypes were shared, with Iu38 being more common on the coast than inland (76% and 27% of the individuals, respectively), and Iu32 more common inland than on the coast (36% and 5%, respectively) (Table 2). In total, more haplotypes were identified in inland wolves (n = 7) than in coastal wolves (n - 3), but no endemic haplotypes present at over 2% were identified in the inland population. Consequently, coastal wolves had lower haplotype diversity {Hd ± SD = 0.390 ± 0.060) than inland wolves (Hd ± SD = 0.749 ± 0.025) and, as a result of all haplotypes being closely related in the coast, coastal wolves also had lower nucleotide diversity (n ± SD = 0.00096 ± 0.00016) than in- land wolves (7t ± SD = 0.00641 ± 0.00057). These data sug- gest that the coastal wolves are more isolated from other wolf populations than the inland wolves are and that their effective population size is smaller. The relationship among haplotypes was reconstructed using an unrooted parsimony network (Fig. 2). The network clearly shows population structure, with several haplotypes present only in either coastal or inland wolves. The single haplotype endemic to coastal wolves, Iu68, is only one base pair different from the widely distributed and most common haplotype, Iu38 (Table 2). To represent graphically the haplotype diversity without imposing any grouping, haplotypes were indicated directly on a map (Fig. 3). Figures 2 and 3 both illustrate visually the difference in haplotypes and haplotype frequency between coastal and inland wolves prior to statistical testing, which requires that the samples be grouped. samova identified structure based on five groups (K = 5) as most probable (#Cr = 0.321; P = 0.006) (Table 3): a coastal group, formed by the four coastal sampling areas plus Vancouver Island (Fig. 1), and the four interior sampling areas. For two groups (K = 2), the most probable structure identified by SAMOVA was based on a coastal group comprising all sampling areas west of the Coast Mountain range, and an inland group comprising all the remaining sampling areas (&amp;Ct = 0.210; P = 0.006). Between K = 2 and K = 5, the coastal sampling areas remained a unified group, whereas the inland sampling areas, initially grouped together, separated sequentially for each increase of K. The coastal sampling areas divided when K was greater than the number of inland sampling areas + 1 (K = 6 and K = 7), but &lt;PCt then decreased. This suggests that the coastal sampling areas form a cohesive group and that greater genetic differentiation exists 1 52q Journal of Biogeography 36, 1 5 1 6-1 53 1 © 2009 The Authors.

A significant positive correlation was found between genetic distance and geographic location (66% of variation explained, P = 0.039), but when latitude and longi- tude were analysed separately, longitude explained more of the genetic differentiation in the data and was marginally signif- icant (41% of variation explained, P = 0.047), and latitude had no explanatory value (P = 0.512). Vegetation cover, as indexed by biogeoclimatic zone, explained 56% of the data and was significant (P = 0.016). Habitat, entered as coast or interior, explained 65% of the data (P = 0.014).

There was a significant association between the presence of white-tailed deer and moose and genetic distance, with 80% (P = 0.017) and 79% (P = 0.001) of the data explained, respectively. The presence of the remaining ungulates was not significantly correlated with genetic distance (all P &gt; 0.05). Black- tailed deer was not tested because it was present in all sampling areas. As before, because Coast South was represented by a small sample (n = 5), we re-ran distlm after removing this sampling area from the analysis, and the conclusions remained the same. These results strongly suggest that habitat is the major factor determining population structure in British Columbia. To place our results in a broader geographical context, differentiation between British Columbia wolves and other adjacent populations in North America (Alaska, Alberta and Northwest Territories) was explored. Pairwise &amp;ST showed significant differentiation in all cases (Table 5). Coastal wolves were more differentiated than were inland wolves from populations outside British Columbia. Inland wolves shared a large proportion of haplotypes, with some differences in frequency, with wolves from Alaska, Alberta and Northwest Territories, whereas coastal wolves were particularly distinct in haplotype frequency and composition from all others (Table 2). Coastal wolves are the only population to have an endemic haplotype with a frequency greater than 5% (Iu68, 19%). The most frequent haplotype in coastal wolves, Iu38 (77%), is widespread across North America, but present at much lower frequencies in other populations (i.e. 9% in central Alaska, 10% in Inuvik, 20% in Alberta and 27% in inland British Columbia). We also calculated pairwise &lt;PSt between coastal wolves and the two currently recognized and geographically adjacent North American wolf subspecies, C. /. occidentalis and C. /. nubilis (as in Nowak, 1995). The subspecies C. /. occidentalis is represented by wolves from Alaska, Alberta and Northwest Territories (Table 2) and C. /. nubilis by historical data (Leonard et ai, 2005). All comparisons were significant (P &lt; 0.00001), with coastal British Columbia wolves being more differentiated from C. /. occidentalis (&amp;St = 0.305) and from G /. nubilis (&lt;PSt = 0.550) than G / occidentalis and G /. nubilis were from each other (&lt;PST = 0.125). The genetic differentiation of coastal wolves from other wolves in North America demonstrates that this population is largely isolated. This genetic distinctiveness, in addition to their unique morphology and ecology (Table 6), strongly supports their status as an ESU sensu Crandall et al. (2000). DISCUSSION Ecology and genetic structure of British Columbia wolves Dispersal distances of 100 km are frequent in wolves (Linnell et ai, 2005), and dispersal distances over 1000 km have been observed (Vila et ai, 2003).

Grey morph with conspicuous Wood (1990) red tones and brown under-fur common. Brownish red tinge, a feature responsible for the one coastal region's historic sub-specific epithet fuscus.

Prey specialization Unique prey-based ecotype: wolf-black- tailed deer Darimont et al (2004); Theberge (1991) system, North America's smallest ungulate. Other regions include black-tailed deer but also other ungulates. Evidence for insular predator-prey (wolf-deer) Darimont et al (2004, 2009) dynamics on islands. Deer consumed at frequencies inversely proportional to island isolation. Populations heavily subsidized by marine resources, Darimont &amp; Reimchen (2002); Darimont et al especially in absence of deer; isotopic data (2003, 2004, 2008, 2009) suggest 25-75% of diet is of marine origin (especially spawning salmon and marine mammals). Salmon hunting behaviour; high efficiencies and Darimont et al (2003) shared fishing techniques and tissue targets across coastal region. Other specific Archipelago environment with islands often smaller Darimont &amp; Paquet (2002); Paquet et al (2006) behaviour than home ranges necessitates frequent swimming between landmasses. disperse from the coastal to the inland habitat is well within the range of dispersal distances of North American wolves, our data suggest that gene flow is largely restricted to within coastal and within inland habitats (Figs 2 &amp; 3, Tables 3-5). This suggests that factors other than distance are responsible for the observed structure. Geographic barriers do not provide a reasonable explanation for population subdivision among British Columbia wolves either. The Coast Mountain Range, which separates coastal from interior areas of British Columbia, averages only 200 km in width, and there are several large drainages that bisect the range, such as the Stikine, Taku, Kitimat and Skeena, that could be used by wolves as corridors. The Rocky Mountains in interior British Columbia, where some of the samples origi- nated, have been recognized as a dispersal corridor for wolves (Boyd et al, 1995; Forbes &amp; Boyd, 1996; Carroll et al, 2004) and are similar in average altitude and width to the Coast Mountain Range. For these reasons, it is unlikely that the Coast Mountain Range accounts for the strong phylogeographic structure we identify in British Columbia wolves. Factors other than geography, such as behaviour, wolf-prey dynamics or natural selection, must therefore be driving the genetic differentiation of British Columbia wolves. Vegetation cover explained 56% of the data and was highly significant (P = 0.016), and so it is an important factor in explaining the pattern of genetic differentiation observed. We also found a significant correlation between genetic differen- tiation and prey, namely white-tailed deer and moose. Both species were absent from our coastal sampling areas (except for moose present in Coast South) and present in all of our inland sampling areas. None of the prey we tested was distributed only on the coast. However, coastal wolves, especially those on islands, can obtain 50% to 75% of their protein from marine sources, including salmon and marine mammals (Darimont et al y 2008). Salmon are consumed to a lesser extent and in fewer areas in interior regions, probably owing to reduced availability (Darimont &amp; Reimchen, 2002). Habitat, defined as coast or interior, explained 65% of the data (P = 0.014). Therefore, habitat appears to be the most likely driving factor for the observed differentiation. Recent analyses of other grey wolf populations with detailed sampling have identified population structure within conti- nents related to climate and vegetation across a west-east axis in North America (Geffen et al, 2004), to hunting specializa- tion on migratory caribou versus non-migratory prey in the North American Arctic (Carmichael et al, 2001, 2007; Musiani et al y 2007), and to climate, habitat type and diet composition in Eastern Europe (Pilot et a/., 2006). In coyotes, natal experience is important in determining where dispersing individuals settle, but overall habitat quality and social cohesion (neighbouring individuals) may be important con- tributors as well (Sacks et a/., 2004, 2005, 2008). Similarly, dispersing wolves in British Columbia may select a territory based on the presence of a particular prey species or, Journal of Biogeography 36, 1 5 1 6-1 53 1 1 525 © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="11">V. Munoz-Fuentes et al. alternatively, on other factors that co-vary with prey distribu- tion. Independent of the availability of particular prey items, habitat structure may be important because it may affect den site selection or the ability to employ learned behaviours. Habitat-biased dispersal may promote divergence between coastal and inland wolves. A reduction in the fitness of dispersing individuals upon reaching ecologically divergent non-natal habitats may further foster genetic isolation ('selection against immigrants'; Nosil et al, 2005). A dispersing individual with learned behavioural adaptations to a particular habitat would have an advantage over dispersers without such experience. Important behavio- ural adaptations may include hunting techniques and disease avoidance. A solitary individual may hunt deer, but capturing and dismembering moose generally requires coordination among several individuals. For example, an interior-born wolf that disperses into coastal areas could forage on salmon, but may be more prone to suffering acute symptoms of salmon- poisoning disease (Neorickettsia helminthoeca), as the con- sumption of salmon tissue types high in parasitic load can be fatal to canids, including wolves (Philip, 1955; Knapp &amp; Millemann, 1970). Coastal wolves consume primarily the head of captured salmon (Darimont et al, 2003), foregoing the nutritionally valuable body presumably to avoid Neorickettsia concentrated in the viscera (Bennington &amp; Pratt, 1960; Baldwin et al, 1967). Marine mammals, too, are a known reservoir of viral diseases to terrestrial mammals (Prato et al, 1974), which could provide novel challenges to wolves migrating from the interior to the coast. Evolutionary origin of British Columbia wolves On a larger geographic scale, all comparisons of genetic differentiation between coastal British Columbia wolves, inland British Columbia wolves and wolves from adjacent areas (Alaska, Alberta and Northwest Territories) were signif- icant. The differentiation between coastal and inland wolves was similar to or greater than the divergence between inland wolves and other more distant populations of wolves in North America (Table 5), which highlights the genetic distinctiveness of the coastal wolves. Differences between wolves from Alaska, Alberta, Northwest Territories and inland British Columbia were the result mostly of differences in frequency of some widely distributed haplotypes that were shared by all popula- tions. In contrast, coastal wolves were differentiated by a combination of highly divergent frequencies in shared hapl- otypes and an endemic haplotype (Iu68) present in 19% of coastal individuals (Table 2). The endemic coastal haplotype (Iu68) differs from a common and widespread haplotype (Iu38) by a single mutation. This close relationship and its uniqueness suggest that this haplotype evolved in the coastal wolf population after this population was isolated from others. During the Last Glacial Maximum, the Canadian Pacific Northwest was almost completely covered by the Cordilleran ice-sheet (Clark et al, 1993). Some animal and plant taxa survived in réfugia north (now Alaska) and south of the ice- sheets as well as to the west in offshore islands and peninsulas (Alexander Archipelago, Queen Charlotte Islands or Haida Gwaii) (e.g. Heaton et al, 1996; Cook et al, 2006). As the ice retreated, many organisms re-colonized coastal and interior British Columbia/Alaska from different réfugia, which left an imprint in current patterns of genetic diversity (e.g. long-tailed vole Microtus longicaudus, Conroy &amp; Cook, 2000; ermine Mustela erminea, Fleming &amp; Cook, 2002; martens Martes sp., Small et al, 2003; deermice Peromyscus sp., Zheng et al, 2003; lichen Lobaria pulmonaria, Walser et al, 2005; moose Alces alces, Hundertmark et al, 2006; lodgepole pine Pinus contorta, Godbout et al, 2008; mountain sorrel Oxyria digyna, Marr et al, 2008). So far, no suitable refugium for wolves has been found in the west, and it has previously been shown that the wolf population in Ice Age Alaska went extinct at the end of the Pleistocene and was not ancestral to any living population (Leonard et al, 2007). Furthermore, in wolves from British Columbia we observed high-frequency haplotypes that have a continent-wide distribution and closely related endemic hapl- otypes. Consequently, these results support an origin from a single refugium. The distribution of common shared haplotypes across all northern North American populations is consistent with the hypothesis that wolves re-colonized Canada and Alaska, including the Pacific Northwest, from south of the ice-sheets after the Cordilleran glacier receded, probably following the northern expansion of deer less than 10 000 years ago (Klein, 1965; Cook et al, 2006; Leonard et al, 2007). This suggests that the strong differentiation between coastal wolves and other North American wolf populations evolved in the Holocene. Post-Pleistocene colonization of previously glaciated areas has left a signature of population differentiation in several species (Hewitt, 2000; and references above). However, given the biology and ecology of the grey wolf, history alone cannot explain the observed population structure on this scale because (1) there is little or no sex-biased dispersal in wolves in North America (Merrill &amp; Mech, 2000; Linnell et al, 2005), (2) the distance between the habitats is small in comparison to the dispersal capability of wolves (Fritts, 1983; Merrill &amp; Mech, 2000; Linnell et al, 2005), and (3) wolves are easily capable of crossing all terrain between the two habitats (Forbes &amp; Boyd, 1996). Therefore, it is necessary to consider alternative explanations for the cause of the observed pattern. Using nuclear microsatellite data, Weckworth et al (2005) identified a similar discontinuity between south-eastern coastal and interior Alaskan wolves. This may suggest that the distinct population we identify in coastal British Columbia extends north through the south-eastern coast and islands of Alaska. Evolutionary distinctiveness of coastal wolves Recently, efforts have been made to standardize the application of units below the species level. The designations management unit (MU) and evolutionarily significant unit (ESU) have been proposed with a series of testable criteria (Moritz, 1994; Journal of Biogeography 36, 1 5 1 6-1 53 1 © 2009 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd</page><page sequence="12">Ecology drives wolf differentiation Crandall et al, 2000). The criteria of Moritz (1994) depend entirely on genetic differentiation, defined as reciprocal monophyly at mitochondrial markers and significant diver- gence at nuclear loci. This definition prioritizes evolutionary heritage over adaptive divergence. By the definitions of Moritz, the coastal wolves constitute a management unit (MU), because they have significantly different frequencies of mtDNA alleles, but are not reciprocally monophyletic, and nuclear divergence has not been tested. Crandall et al (2000) give weight to both historical isolation and adaptive distinctiveness. They developed a classification in which four null hypotheses of exchangeability must be tested. The four hypotheses are recent and historical genetic and ecological exchangeability. The rejection patterns of those hypotheses lead to different management actions. In the case of the coastal wolves, two of the three criteria Crandall et al (2000) suggested were used to reject the hypotheses of current and historic genetic exchangeability: the observation of a unique allele (Iu68) and low gene-flow estimates (Nm &lt; 1, approximately when FSt = 0-2). Crandall et al (2000) recom- mended testing the hypotheses regarding ecological exchange- ability by overlaying ecological data on the underlying genealogy of the population. We have done this by employing a method for non-parametric multivariate analysis of variance (Anderson, 2001), which has been developed since Crandall et al (2000) published their recommendations but applies very well to these data. These tests showed a significant correlation between genetic diversity and ecological factors. In addition, rejection of the hypotheses of ecological exchangeability is further strengthened by aspects of the coastal wolves' biology and ecology, including a unique diet heavily influenced by marine resources, distinct behaviours such as swimming in the open ocean between landmasses, and their darker colour, smaller size and cranial and dental morphology (Table 6). Therefore, the null hypotheses of recent and historic genetic and ecological exchangeability can be rejected for the coastal wolves, and hence they should be classified as an ESU sensu Crandall et al (2000). Another definable, sub-specific unit is the designatable unit (DU) (Green, 2005). This unit avoids a judgement of evolutionary importance, and is designed to be the basic unit within species. The genetic and biogeographical distinctiveness of coastal British Columbia wolves each independently qual- ifies them as a DU. This terminology is of particular relevance in the context of British Columbia wolves because it has been accepted by the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (Green, 2005). Subspecies of grey wolves have been described based on morphological characteristics (Young &amp; Goldman, 1944; Hall, 1981; Nowak, 1995). Of the 24 subspecies across North America recognized by Hall (1981), three coastal subspecies were identified: Canis lupus ligoni in south-east Alaska, C. /. fuscus in coastal British Columbia, Washington and Oregon (now only extant in British Columbia), and C. /. crassodon on Vancouver Island. The most recent revision of North American wolf taxonomy reduced the 24 previously recognized North American subspecies to five and pooled all coastal wolves into the subspecies C. I nubilus, which includes wolves from most of the conterminous United States and eastern Canada, including the Hudson Bay area (Nowak, 1995). Notably, wolves from coastal British Columbia were not included in the accompanying morphological analyses (No- wak, 1995). In our study, we found that the level of genetic differentiation between wolves of coastal British Columbia and subspecies in North America {sensu Nowak, 1995) was greater than that between subspecies. Future taxonomic work involv- ing a detailed morphological analysis of coastal wolves in comparison with wolves from elsewhere in North America, reconciled with genetic data, would be informative on the subspecies issue. Although no type specimen was designated, the subspecies fuscus was the first used for coastal wolves (Richardson, 1839) and therefore has precedence over the other two subspecies designations. Conservation implications Coastal wolves are an isolated population uniquely adapted to the temperate rain forests of North America's north-west coast. These forests once stretched from California to southern Alaska (Schoonmaker et al, 1997), but more than half have been severely altered by clear-cut logging and other human activities, especially in California, Oregon and Washington, where wolves were extirpated Qeo et al, 1999). Wolves of coastal rain forests are now restricted to British Columbia and south-east Alaska. Of the remaining coastal wolves, those in British Columbia occupy some of the most pristine wolf habitat remaining on Earth and have enjoyed relative freedom from persecution by humans. However, the future of this remnant population is not clear. Coastal wolves from south- east Alaska are threatened by extensive timber removal, which has been predicted to cause a decline in deer and, conse- quently, wolf populations (Person et al, 1996). Direct over- harvesting could also become a problem as their habitat becomes more accessible to hunters via logging roads (Kirch- hoff, 1991; USDA Forest Service, 1991; Person &amp; Ingle, 1995; Person et al, 1996). Another anthropogenic threat to these wolves comes in the form of domestic dogs, through their ability to spread canid diseases and potentially hybridize with wolves (Vila et al, 2003). Both protection of the Pacific temperate rain forest and mitigation of these threats are needed for the long-term conservation of coastal wolves. The results presented here illustrate how habitat differences drive and maintain genetic differentiation in the grey wolf. The observation of this pattern in an ecosystem generalist with great dispersal capabilities suggests that ecological factors may drive genetic differentiation in other species as well. Even in cases without obvious phenotypic adaptations, populations of one species living in different habitats may represent distinct subsets of the total genetic diversity. Conservation program- mes thus should aim to encompass as much ecological diversity as possible to preserve species-wide genetic diversity and evolutionary potential.
