<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Apocalyptic Vision in Paradise Lost. By Leland Ryken. Ithaca and London: Cornell University Press, 1970. Pp. xi+239. $7.40. Leland Ryken's The Apocalyptic Vision in liParadise Lost" does what few books about Milton's epic written before this past decade attempted. It makes the language of the poem its subject and the examination of details its substance. It argues the necessity for close attention to the text and proceeds by demonstration through generous quotation. The details which it examines are those "apocalyptic techniques"?some times called "motifs", "patterns" or "themes"?by which Milton portrays material "not directly accessible to human experience." These "techniques" are categorized and profusely illustrated in Chapters 3 through 7. The first category consists of devices designed to portray "apocalyptic reality" by contrasting it with "ordinary human existence," distinguishing Eden or Heaven from the fallen world in "then-now" constructions, com paratives and superlatives, adjectives "denoting apocalyptic characteristics" applied to "empirical nouns," debased Latin words used for their purer root meanings, oxymorons, and, more unexpectedly, traditional "enamelled images" depicting "a transcencental realm whose permanence forms a con trast with the transient world of earthly experience." Other categories are defined in successive chapters as "Apocalypse through Negation," "Apocalypse through Analogy," "Apocalypse through Distance," and "Apocalyptic Imagery." The techniques grouped as negation include adjectives like infinite "based on denial of empirical qualities," but also larger "patterns of rejection" such as the "inactivity of Heaven" or the absence of qualities in Eden which are part of our fallen existence. The dis cussion of analogy (which turns out to mean any "similarity") treats the critically sensitive subject of Milton's anthropomorphism but also all kinds of descriptive vocabulary used for Heaven?urban, courtly, martial?and for</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 307 Eden?"the flora and fauna of the garden are essentially those of our own experience." Indirect narration, spatial and temporal distinctions, blurring among persons of the Trinity are included among techniques in "the area of distancing the apocalyptic vision from our direct view and maintaining the remoteness of the vision." Grouped as "apocalyptic imagery" (an "image" is defined as "any word which names a phenomenon existing in human ex perience") are conceptual, generic, and nonvisual sensory language. The existence of these "techniques" is argued as a defense of the poem against attacks on it for excessive anthropomorphism, confusing paradoxes, vagueness and sensuously impoverished imagery, because they are "techniques" de signed to portray "apocalyptic reality." The abundance of quotations in these chapters has the inevitable effect of showing yet again how details in Paradise Lost form intricately related patterns which, in their cumulative effects, seem richly evocative. But Chapters 3 through 7 do not really explore this quality. Each begins with a large statement such as, "One of the commonest techniques by which poets have portrayed apocalyptic reality is through contrast with ordinary human experience," which is followed by long lists of quoted phrases illustrating related "techniques." At the end of each section and chapter, where we expect a point to be made, a conclusion reached, we usually find a variation of the introductory statement: "Each time such a superlative description appears, whether it is applied to Heaven and its agents or to Paradise and its inhab itants, we are reminded of the contrast which exists between the apocalyptic state and the earthly existence which we know." The intervening groups of quotations have scarcely enriched our sense of the poem: they remain illustra tions of the category designated in the chapter heading. Even more disap pointingly, the final chapter misleads us by its grand title, "The Unified Apocalyptic Vision." Here we expect that the details previously categorized will be drawn together into some larger understanding of the poem, but in stead each kind of "technique" is illustrated again, this time by examples taken from a few single passages rather than from wherever they occur in the poem. We learn no more than that extended quotation is another way to il lustrate the "techniques" discussed before. The Introduction and Chapter 2, "Theoretic Considerations," are not more successful in guiding the reader to important questions about the poem because they are at once too complicated and not sufficiently complex. First we are given an unnecessarily elaborate definition of "apocaplytic" which, in the body of the book, never means anything less vague than what is "not directly accessible to human experience." We are then given a brief discussion of "background" ending, as usual, with a summary: "Considered together, the doctrine of accommodation, the Platonic theory of Ideas, and Christian humanism constitute the theoretic underpinning of Milton's apocalyptic vision." These neat divisions show how complex modes of thinking are re duced to oversimplicity, and the crude metaphor of "underpinning" in dicates no sophisticated sense of relations between such traditional modes of thought and the actual language of the poem. Such a sense is what the book lacks.

Close attention to the text and demonstration by generous quotation do not lead here to a richer reading of Paradise Lost. Anne Ferry Boston College</page></plain_text>
