This, too, remains a judgment for which strictly historical analysis is unsuited. Carl R. Holladay Candler School of Theology, Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322 The Merkabah in Rabbinic Literature, by David J. Halperin. AOS 62. New Haven: American Oriental Society, 1980. Pp. xii+212. $14. This book is a triumph for the new form-critical methodologies. The author deals with texts familiar to scholars in rabbinics and mysticism. Usually, the attributions and editorial settings of these texts are taken for granted, either on scholarly or on ideological grounds, and whole histories are spun out. Halperin, however, following the method of his thesis director (Baruch Bokser) and his director's director (Jacob Neusner), has approached the materials afresh in an exceptionally thorough, learned, and judicious manner. The new methods have now seen a second generation of scholars and are assured of their place in history. In his Introduction, Halperin notes that Scholem makes two claims about the Maaseh Merkabah texts: (1) that they are a bridge between the apocalyptic and the Heikhalot materials; and (2) that they betray a milieu of ecstatic mysticism, the associated dangers being the perils of the ecstatic ascent (pp. 3-4). Halperin notes, however, that the extant exegeses of Ezekiel 1 do not betray any such tendencies, nor are they esoteric. He proposes therefore, a re- examination of the rabbinic sources and sets forth four methodological principles, the most important of which is that the redactional meaning may not be the same as the original mean- ing (pp. 6-8). Chap. One is an overview of the sources. Chap. Two deals with Mishnaic sources by examining internal forms, parallels, and terms (including prefixes). Halperin concludes that m. Hag. 2:1 did not speak of any ecstatic mysticism but was an attempt, consistent with general mishnaic principles, to restrain exegeses that might have been potentially questionable. The effort, he notes, did not succeed since Ezekiel 1 continued to be read and preached in public, as well as studied (pp. 59-62). Chap. Three deals with a set of parallel texts from the Tosefta and the Palestinian and Babylonian Talmuds. After detailed analysis of forms, parallels, and terms, plus an additional analysis of each pericope, Halperin concludes that this set of texts had a common source (pp. 82, 104) and was re-worked by the compiler thereof into a redactional unity. The compiler's meaning was that of a warning against the study of esoteric matters, though this was not always the meaning of the original passages (pp. 91-92, 104). Chap. Four deals with the stories of Yohanan ben Zakkai. After meticulous analysis, Hal- perin concludes that the supernatural motifs were probably early and not later accretions; that they were used to support rabbinic authority in all sorts of matters; and that they were, in any case, secondary phenomena and not sought-after mystical effects (pp. 133-40). Chap. Five deals with the materials from the Palestinian Talmud and Chap. Six deals with those from the Babylonian Talmud. The latter clearly shows a modification of earlier materials into settings of mystical heavenly ascents as well as a retrojection of its views onto the period of Yohanan ben Zakkai in an effort to bolster rabbinic authority (pp. 162-67, 176-77). The Conclusion summarizes the sources, sets forth Halperin's very clear model for the development of the Maaseh Merkabah materials (pp. 182-83), and ends by noting that Scholem is probably incorrect in both his claims. What was the content of Maaseh Merkabah such that the early rabbis were worried about its exposition, such that popular tradition projected ill-defined "dangers" into it, and such that later rabbis projected heavenly ascent into it? Halperin points out that it was not 612</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 613 anthropomorphism (pp. 157-58, 175). Nor was it (originally) ecstatic mystical techniques (p. 175, passim). Nor was it an esoteric, secret exegetical tradition: that was simply "legend" and "fiction" (pp. 140, 183). Perhaps, it was an association between Ezekiel's "foot of a calf" and the Golden Calf (pp. 53-55, 158, 185). Or, perhaps it was some non-rabbinic, or peripherally rabbinic, mystical or esoteric tradition (p. 184). The study is masterful and I think that, for the time being, Halperin is right: we cannot know more from these sources. David R. Blumenthal Emory University, Atlanta, GA 30322 L'Hypostase des Archontes: Traite gnostique sur l'origine de l'homme, du monde et des Archontes (NH 11,4), by Bernard Barc, and Norea (NH IX,2), by Michel Roberge. Bibliotheque copte de Nag Hammadi, Section "Textes," 5. Quebec/Louvain: Universite Laval/Peeters, 1980. Pp. xii+173. $20. This fifth volume in the French larrguage series of editions of Nag Hammadi texts, edited by J. E. Menard for the Laboratoire d'Histoire Religieuse at Laval University, contains two separate works. In the first, Bernard Barc presents a detailed commentary on Hypostasis of the Archons (NHC II 4), which he reads with admirable consistency and sympathy. In seeking to discover the text's internal logic and to capture the nuances of this particular version of gnostic creation myth, he has produced the kind of well-focused commentary of which all the Nag Hammadi texts are so much in need. As such, the commentary serves as an insightful introduc- tion to the complexities of studying the Hypostasis of the Archons, ranging from the identifica- tion of the understood antecedents of ambiguous pronouns to the interpretation of gnostic symbolism. In Barc's opinion, the text was not meant, even in antiquity, for the uninitiated. This inherent obscurity makes it all the more necessary for the modern interpreter to approach the text well-versed in related literature. Even so, Barc finds that the text cannot be made internally consistent. This inconsistency has led Barc, like others before him, to resort to a source analysis. His analysis (pp. 1-48) is well-reasoned and merits close attention, for if he is correct, it may be possible to evaluate Hypostasis of the Archons still more precisely as evidence for the geneal- ogy of "gnosticism," and of "Sethian gnosticism" in particular. Three sources are distinguished, two of them by means of clearly presented comparisons of Hypostasis of the Archons to related sections of On the Origin of the World (NHC II 5) and Apocryphon of John (NHC II 1): (1) An Anthropogonic Outline, narrating the creation of Adam and the births of Cain, Abel, and Seth, which can be compared with formally similar outlines preserved in rabbinic literature. Hyp. Arch. 87:11-92:18 (glosses excepted; see below) was composed by expanding this outline with (2) True Genesis, a gnostic version of Genesis 1-6, of which the canonical version could be regarded as a falsified paraphrase. The anthropogonic section of Hypostasis of the Archons thus formed is introduced and followed by sections draw- ing on (3) a Theogonic Source, dealing with the history of the material universe prior to the creation of Adam. A brief resume of this source (86:26-87:11) introduces the anthropogonic section, and the source in its entirety forms part (94:4-96:11) of the concluding dialogue between Norea and the Great Angel (Eleleth). Barc suggests that the text thus composed was a sectarian manual meant for use by an initiate as an aide-memoire in expounding the sect's doctrine. The author was a "gnostic Jew" intent on attracting adherents to his sect from among those faithful to "official Judaism." Barc suggests, with little argumentation, or speculation on the historical significance of such a text, that this original version of Hypostasis of the Archons may have been composed in Alexandria, possibly early in the second century.</page></plain_text>
