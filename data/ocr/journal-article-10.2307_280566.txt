<plain_text><page sequence="1">PORum A CULTURAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT DILEMMA: ANASAZI RUINS AND THE NAVAJOS H. Barry Holt Archaeologists recently have been focusing increased attention on Native American concerns and ar- chaeology. However, some serious issues of Native American attitudes toward the activities of archaeology have so far been overlooked. For example, in the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mexico, archaeological activities that have been spurred by energy development violate certain tenets of the Navaojo Way of living, with possible adverse effects. Suggestions for the mitigation of these effects are presented as a way of expand- ing the dialogue between archaeologists and Native American communities, in order to identify and resolve such ethical dilemmas. Within the last several years, archaeologists who, in the course of their investigations, come in- to contact with Native American communities have begun to raise issues concerning the relation- ships between archaeological investigations and American Indians. These issues have been con- cerned both with research questions and methodologies (Trigger 1980) and with ethical respon- sibilities within the archaeological profession (Winter 1980). While studies of Native American communities have long provided information to archaeologists for use in ethnographic analogues and historical reconstructions, the passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act (P.L. 95-341) focused public and archaeological awareness upon some of the religious and/or ethical aspects of investigating prehistoric Native Americans. The Religious Freedom Act has provided a mechanism and indeed, a justification, for addressing Native American concerns within a federal land management context. However, the use of this mechanism can generate disturbing questions about the ethics of the entire profession of American archaeology as it relates to certain Native American groups. One region where these questions are salient is the San Juan Basin of northwestern New Mex- ico. In addition to being the focal point of that aspect of prehistoric Anasazi culture commonly called the "Chacoan Phenomenon," the Basin also contains a wealth of coal, oil, gas, and uranium reserves. Most of these vast energy stores lie beneath federally administered or state land. As a result of this apparently fortuitous circumstance, federal and state cultural resource statutes and regulations have necessitated much archaeological research. Every year in the Basin archaeol- ogists from private companies, educational institutions, and government agencies survey the land- scape, examining wellpads and highways, searching for "Chacoan roads," and excavating prehistoric communities in advance of their destruction by strip mines or irrigation projects. All of this scientific archaeological activity adds greatly to our stores of knowledge about prehistoric subsistence strategies, settlement patterns, and social systems. This must be archaeology at its best-development and knowledge through preservation and impact mitigation. However, the San Juan Basin, an archaeological Eldorado, is also the center of the traditional homeland of the most populous Native American group, the Navajos. While attempts are being H.

An understanding of Navajo traditional religious beliefs as they relate to the remnants of prehistoric cultures within their homeland may provide an example of the ethical dilemmas facing our profes- sion. THE ANASAZI OF NAVAJO LEGENDS Throughout the origin legends of the Navajos are references to ruins that today are recognized as structures built by the prehistoric Anasazi. While in some instances these structures are re- ferred to as homes of supernatural beings (Matthews 1897:81, 138), usually they are seen as oc- cupied or abandoned Puebloan constructions (Kluckhohn 1967:166-167; Matthews 1897:77, 81-82). This recognition of the relationship between the ruins and Pueblo peoples explains much about Navajo attitudes toward Anasazi ruins. The Navajos were preceded in creation by the Pueblo peoples, Khis'ani, and while the origin legends relate that these distinct groups did live together harmoniously for a time, eventually distrust forced them to live apart (Franciscan Fathers 1910:356-357; Matthews 1897:70-78, 195-208). Substantiating this distrust within a ritual context is the legend forming the basis of the Blessingway ceremony. According to this important tenet of Navajo belief, the Anasazi no longer exist because they were destroyed by the wind as a result of their blasphemies against nature, especially their painting sacred designs on utilitarian pottery and their living in rectangular stone houses (Wyman 1970:58-59; Medicinemen 1980-1981). Other legends describe later relations be- tween the Navajos and Puebloan peoples as being violent, with numerous references to Navajo raids against pueblos and captives being taken as slaves (Matthews 1897:146, 158). In fact, one critical curing ceremony, the Enemyway. is based upon a legend that has as a major component the "Pueblo War" motif, describing a bloody Navajo attack against a pueblo (Wyman 1957:18-24). Historical data tend to confirm these periods of adversary relationships between the Navajos and the Pueblos, beginning as early as the mid-seventeenth century (Brugge 1980:8). The Navajos describe the long-dead inhabitants of the ruins that dot their homeland as anaasazi, old or ancient enemy (Fransted 1979:61). These structures where the Anasazi lived and died are still occupied, according to Navajo tradition, by the ghosts of a blasphemous ancient adversary. Certain groups of Navajos hold a somewhat different attitude toward prehistoric ruins, viewing them as the homes of their ancestors (Wyman 1970:458-459). The origin legends do provide some basis for this belief, with several episodes recorded in which Pueblo peoples encounter and some- times join Navajo clans after famine forces them to leave their own people (Matthews 1897:145). Even Puebloan slaves of the Navajos were sometimes accepted into Navajo clans (Franciscan Fathers 1910:426; Matthews 1897:146, 158). Historical references to the Pueblo refugees after the Revolt of 1680 against the Spanish confirm migrations into Navajo land (Brugge 1980:20). In fact, several major Anasazi ruins are viewed by certain Navajo clans as being ancestral dwell- ings (Fransted 1979:39; Van Valkenburgh 1974:38; Wyman 1970:458-459). In light of the above, it is likely that certain groups of Navajos may view certain Anasazi ruins as crucially important to their personal history, and as the burial places of their ancestors. RUINS AS SACRED PLACES Many Anasazi ruins are referred to in Navajo legends. usually as locations along the paths of heroes as they wander throughout the Navajo homeland. Several of them are important in specific legendary stories intended to convey principles of the Navajo Way of living. As a result of such references, these major Anasazi ruins are considered sacred by the Navajos. and they thus come to be utilized as ceremonial locations. Anasazi ruins play an important role as gathering areas in numerous ritual activities of the 595</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Navajos. Each ceremony within traditional Navajo religion requires certain material ingredients that must be utilized in order for the ceremony to be effective. Some of these ingredients are gathered at ruins. Both medicinal plants and clay have been reported as being gathered on or near major Anasazi ruins (Franciscan Fathers 1910:410; Fransted 1979:25). More important, however, is the fact that Navajo religious practitioners utilize arrowpoints in their bundles of ceremonial paraphernalia. Ruins of all sizes are, of course, the obvious gathering areas for such items (Kluckhohn and Wyman 1940:34). Finally, one specific category of Navajo curing ceremonies utilizes ruins as an essential ele- ment for success: remaking rites. These rapid and inexpensive rituals for the curing of minor ill- nesses (Haile 1947:2-4) involve the carving of small animal figurines or anthropomorphic dolls that represent the cause of the illness. Once the practitioner ritualistically infuses a doll with the patient's contamination, it must be placed in an area accessible to supernaturals (Haile 1947:2; Kelley 1972:40). Under most circumstances, the dolls are deposited in prehistoric ruins, in order to effect the cure. A spiritual connection is believed to exist between these dolls and the patient's well-being, and if the figurine is disturbed, the remade harmony will be disrupted and a relapse can take place. In addition, the figurines, once deposited, become the property of the super- naturals (Haile 1947:2; Kelley 1972:40) and are filled with spiritual contaminant (Lang and Walters 1972:60). As can be seen from the above, Anasazi ruins are endowed by the Navajos with a mythological presence, and they are used in ritual activities. Their sacred qualities result from both of these aspects, and, as a result, they occupy important positions in traditional Navajo religion. THE DANGERS OF ARCHAEOLOGY Navajo legends sometimes provide unclear or even contradictory guidance for living in har- mony with nature. However, one of the clearest messages within this body of tradition is that con- tact with the dead or ghosts will bring misfortune or even death (Matthews 1897:78). Such misfor- tune is manifested in the form of "ghost sickness." Looking upon the corpse of an animal or human, failing to conduct a proper burial, or disturbing a grave can provoke supernatural retribu- tion (Kluckhohn and Leighton 1974:185). Even unwitting entry into areas of death can result in ill- ness (Reichard 1950:81-82). As a result, some degree of fear of the dead and ghosts is ever- present within Navajo communities. Because Anasazi ruins are burial places of enemies, or sometimes ancestors, any disturbance of them will antagonize the inhabiting spirits, which will result in retribution. In the same vein, all who view bones exposed from the unearthing of a prehistoric burial become vulnerable to "ghost sickness" (Reichard 1950:159). Navajos view "pot hunting" with great distress, as can be seen from a recollection of Mrs. Richard Wetherill (of Chaco Canyon) as told to Gordon Vivian (1948). Apparently a Navajo wished to dig for pottery and turquoise in one of the ruins of Chaco Canyon, but he was so afraid of antagonizing ghosts that only Mrs. Wetherill's setting off a magical charge of photographic powder would ease his fears. Navajo attitudes about disturbance of Anasazi ruins extend to professional archaeological in- vestigations. Archaeologists have reported illnesses arising during excavations in Navajo country that have been diagnosed by Navajo workmen as "ghost sickness" (Richard W. Loose, personal communication), and some authors indicate that just looking at ruins may be construed as a form of disturbance (Fransted 1979:6; Reichard 1950:81). Our most cherished form of nondisturbing ar- chaeology, the noncollection survey, may provoke grave threats to the well-being of the archaeol- ogist, according to traditional Navajo beliefs. However, another aspect of traditional Navajo reality raises a more unsettling issue. If a ruin is disturbed, it is considered most likely that retribution will be directed against the perpetrator. But, if the culprit manages to escape harm, the potential for misfortune remains in the area and endangers the local inhabitants (Martin Top- per, personal communication). In fact, young men from potentially affected Navajo communities have volunteered at times to serve on excavation teams in advance of needed construction proj- ects in an effort to deflect any supernatural retribution away from their communities onto them- 596 [Vol. 48, No. 3,19831</page><page sequence="4">FORUM selves. These actions usually have been preceded by prophylactic rituals and followed by exor- cistic ceremonies. Finally, Navajo beliefs concerning witchcraft can be associated with archaeo- logical activities around ruins. Only witches will go near graves, and grave robbing is one of their known activities (Kluckhohn 1967:28-29; Kluckhohn and Leighton 1974:202; Reichard 1950:82). Objects associated with places of death, and even parts of corpses, are used by witches as poison against their enemies (Kluckhohn 1967:25; Kluckhohn and Leighton 1974:187; Reichard 1950: 595-596). As a result, archaeologists and any Navajos who may work with them are vulnerable to charges of witchcraft leveled by members of Navajo communities. All of this suggests that our ac- tions as archaeologists, regardless of legality or professionalism, may today be introducing into Navajo communities extraordinary stress and concern about their well-being. INDIANS AND ARCHAEOLOGISTS Traditional Navajo religious beliefs hold that prehistoric ruins are dangerous and useful sacred places. It mut be remembered, however, that Navajos display a wide range of adherence to these beliefs. Some communities may be extremely concerned about the status of ruins in their vicinity, while others are only slightly concerned, and still others may not care at all. Only by contacting local Navajo residents can one discover local attitudes about nearby ruins. In addition, if a Nava- jo community is confronted with a decision between a critically needed road or development proj- ect impacting sacred ruins and no development, at times they will acknowledge their uneasiness about the disturbance while demanding that the project be accomplished. Currently in the San Juan Basin, many archaeologists demonstrate their respect for the Native American culture they are affecting by contacting local residents prior to fieldwork. And there have been circumstances in which archaeologists have taken extraordinary steps to be sensitive to the spiritual concerns of the Navajos (Spain 1981). However, it must be acknowledged that our daily actions as practicing archaeologists violate certain rules of the traditional Navajo Way of liv- ing. These actions are threatening to the very Native American communities whose heritage we are striving to protect. The above above circumstances demonstrate the considerable problems involved in conducting ar- chaeological research on Navajo land. However, archaeologists can take certain steps to mitigate the potential adverse effects of their activities. In the absence of federal implementing regula- tions for the Religious Freedom Act, I recommend the following: 1. The sponsor of a proposed project (company, state agency, federal agency) should be in- formed of the potentially sensitive nature of archaeological investigations. This information should encourage sufficient advance notice of the project requirements to allow the archaeologist to identify local Navajo communities that might have concerns about proposed investigations. 2. Sponsors of major projects, involving substantial survey and excavation of ruins, should be encouraged to contact local Navajo officials concerning actions that might mitigate the adverse effects of the archaeological investigations. These actions could include prophylactic or exor- cistic ceremonies to protect the local communities. As these ceremonies often are expensive to perform, sponsors should be made aware of the burdens their projects may impose and should consider funding assistance (Holt 1981:52). 3. The archaeologist should contact local Navajo government officials to inform them of the in- vestigations and to solicit information about local community views toward ruins and their exam- ination (cf. Doyel 1982:639; Holt 1981:51). 4. Prior to initiating fieldwork, the archaeologist should attempt to contact Navajo residents in the immediate vicinity of the project area in order to explain the nature of the investigations. Many times these residents already have consented to or have even requested the proposed proj- ects. As a result, this contact can serve to assure them of the legitimacy of the archaeological ac- tivities and ease any fears concerning grave robbing or vandalism of ruins. 5. If during investigations the archaeologist encounters evidence of Navajo ritual usage of the 597</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY area, care should be taken not to disturb any ritual paraphernalia until, if necessary, local religious practitioners can be contacted about proper disposal or relocation of the items. 6. On occasion, either by accident or design, a few archaeologists have hired Native American crews that have included religious practitioners. This circumstance has resulted in fewer prob- lems regarding incidence of "ghost sickness" and other ailments (Meade F. Kemrer, personal communication). As a result, archaeologists should consider hiring practitioners as crew members, or making prior arrangements to hire local practitioners to assist on an occasional basis to care for the spiritual needs of the other crew members. Although these suggested actions will not completely resolve the conflict between archaeological practice and Navajo traditional religious concerns, they may demonstrate our respect for and willingness to accommodate, as much as possible, Navajo beliefs. The desecration of sacred places and the ghoulish despoiling of places of the dead are not the obvious objectives or the intended results of archaeology. And yet, as can be seen from the Navajo example, our actions may be viewed in that light by Native American communities. It is the obliga- tion of the profession of archaeology to consider not only the obvious and convenient aspects of concern for Native American beliefs, but also the disconcerting issues that have been overlooked. This will result, no doubt, in the exposure of difficult ethical dilemmas, which should be thoroughly examined and, eventually, resolved. A broadening of the current dialogue between Native American communities and archaeologists is necessary, along with the continuing interest and sensitivity of social scientists in understanding Native American concerns.
