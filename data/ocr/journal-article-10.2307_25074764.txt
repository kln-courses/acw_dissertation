<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ethical Compliance Programs and Corporate Illegality: Testing the Assumptions of the Corporate Sentencing Guidelines Marie McKendall Beverly DeMarr Catherine Jones-Rikkers ABSTRACT. This study failed to support a commonly held assumption that the types of corpo rate ethical compliance programs advocated by the 1991 Uniform Sentencing Guidelines will result in less organizational illegality. We studied 108 large corporations to determine whether ethical codes, communication about ethics, ethics training, and incorporating ethics into human resources practices would result in fewer OSHA violations. The results of a TOB IT regression analyses indicated that ethical compliance programs did not lessen legal violations. Indeed, our one significant main effect suggested the possibility that ethics programs may serve as window dressing to deflect attention and or culpability resulting from illegal actions. Lower firm profitability did result in a greater number of willful and repeat OSHA violations. Introduction The last two decades have seen a rapid escala tion in concern over the ethical work climate of organizations, defined as "the prevailing per ceptions of typical organizational practices and procedures that have ethical content" (Victor and Cullen, 1988, p. 101). It is believed that because the law is an expression of "a broad moral con sensus" (Finney and Lesieur, 1982, p. 265), an organization's ethical climate will serve as a modifier of motive and opportunity, either prompting or discouraging organizations from engaging in illegal behavior (Stone, 1975; Clinard and Yeager, 1980; Ermann and Lundman, 1982b). This line of reasoning reflects Sutherland's (1949) early thesis that proclivities toward illegality are likely to be influenced by organizational norms that stipulate expectations about legal compliance. The belief that an organization's ethical climate and practices will influence illegal behavior is reflected in the provisions of the United States Federal Sentencing Guidelines, a set of statutes that attempts to bring greater sentencing unifor mity and more severe penalties to corporations that have broken the law. The Guidelines allow penalties to be reduced if an organization can show it had an effective ethics compliance program in place at the time of the violation. The content of the Guidelines raises some interesting questions about ethics in business. What led the Commission to believe that ethical compliance programs would significantly reduce illegal behavior in corporations? And, more importantly, were they correct - do devices such as ethical codes, ethical training, ethical hotlines, etc. lower the number of illegal actions by corporations? This paper will examine the prescriptions offered by researchers about how to create an effective ethical compliance program, and it will show how these prescriptions are reflected in the Sentencing Guidelines. We will then report the results of a study of 108 corporations that will add to the very scant literature that actually examines whether ethical practices by organiza tions have any impact on legal violations. Finally, we will add to the corporate illegality literature by using Occupational Safety and Health violations rather than the far more frequently studied anti-trust violations. ?* Journal of Business Ethics 37: 367-383, 2002. r* ? 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

Theories of corporate illegality Theories of corporate illegality developed by Finney and Lesieur (1982), Coleman (1987), and Baucus (1994) postulated that in order for cor porate illegality to occur, three factors must be present. First, there must be a motivating tension for the organization to break the law in order to achieve goals or to ensure survival. Second, in the presence of such motivation, factors that offer the opportunity for organizations to engage in illegal behavior must also be present. Finally, given motive and opportunity, illegal actions will occur when there are no effective controls in place to prevent or discourage such behavior. Motive Motive refers to the factors that incite organiza tions to commit illegal acts. Perceived unfairness and inefficiency of the regulatory system (Clinard et al., 1979), a consumption oriented American society that emphasizes profits as the primary goals of business (Conklin, 1977), and expecta tions of high profitability and the respect accorded to firms that demonstrate such achieve ment (Yeager, 1986) may act as a general induce ments for corporations to break the law. However, the study of motive has focused on what induces specific firms to break the law more than others when all are subject to the same general pressures. Consequently, two factors postulated to create motive have been extensively studied - low firm profits and industry financial hardship. Financial strain is hypothesized to be a major motivation to engage in illegal behavior; lower profits create a tension to use illegal means to acquire resources, improve competitive position and/or cut costs. A number of studies have found that illegal action is more likely to occur in firms operating in economically depressed industries and firms experiencing individual profit problems, although these effects are often small (Lane, 1953; Palmer, 1972; Staw and Szwajkowski, 1975; Asch and Seneca, 1976; Clinard et al., 1979; Simpson, 1986; Cochran and Nigh, 1987; McKendall et al, 1999). Two other studies, however, have not replicated these findings (Baucus and Near, 1991; Hill et al., 1992), and one found the opposite effect (McKendall and Wagner, 1997). Opportunity Motive alone is not sufficient; opportunity must also be present before corporate illegal action can occur. Opportunity makes an illegal behavioral option available to members of an organization by generating conditions conducive to violating the law and impeding detection and/or signifi cant punishment. Opportunity factors can also lead to unintentional or careless violations by creating conditions in which optimal decision making is compromised. Researchers hypothe size that the wider the window of opportunity, the more likely that legal violations will occur (Kriesburg, 1976; Colemen, 1987; Baucus, 1994). The most studied opportunity variable is organization size. Large firms have greater resources that allow them to more easily absorb legal fees, regulatory agency fines, punitive awards and other costs of illegal actions. Most studies have found that large organization size is correlated with a greater number of legal violations (Asch and Seneca, 1976; Perez, 1978; Cochran and Nigh, 1987; Dalton and Kesner, 1988; Baucus and Near, 1991; McKendall et al., 1999). High industry concentration is another variable that might create the opportunity for illegal behavior because collusion is easier among small numbers of firms (Clinard et al., 1979), low industry concentration might also create oppor tunistic conditions because regulatory agencies have a harder time monitoring actions and detecting illegalities among a large number of firms (Szwajkowski, 1986). Most of the research on industry concentration is older and looked at anti-trust violations. Several studies found more illegal behavior in highly concentrated industries (Leonard and Weber, 1970; Hay and Kelly, 1974; Clinard et al., 1979), while two found more illegal activity in industries with a low degree of concentration (Burton, 1966; Riedel, 1968).</page><page sequence="3">Ethical Compliance Programs and Corporate Illegality 369 One recent study found that lower levels of industry concentrations were positively related to serious environmental law violations (McKendall et al., 1999). A final opportunity variable that is frequently mentioned but not often studied is organizational structure. Organizations become more complex as the number of subunits, levels of management, and operating sites increases (Price and Mueller, 1986; Hall, 1991). Theorists speculate that high levels of organizational complexity can contribute to illegality because such a structure decreases communication, coordination and managerial control, and allows the "abdication of a degree of personal responsibility for almost every type of decision" (Clinard and Yeager, 1980, p. 4). An additional aspect of organization structure that has been hypothesized to correlate with illegal behavior is organizational decentralization. An organization becomes more decentralized as its decision making focus is dispersed downward and outward. Decentralization allows people greater freedom and flexibility in decision making; accountability is reduced and fragmented as more people at lower levels participate in decision making (Clinard et al., 1979). Large, complex decentralized organizations can there fore lead to violations because concealment is easier when accountability is dispersed; violations can also occur because constricted information flows and fragmented decision making impedes the ability to make good choices. Other than a few case studies, there has been little research on corporate structure and orga nizational illegality. Hill (1992) examined the relationship between organizational decentraliza tion and several types of illegal behavior and found no significant results. McKendall et al. (1997) studied organizational complexity and decentralization and found that they interacted with a number of other variables to produce more violations of environmental law. Control Given the presence of significant levels of motive and opportunity, the choice to engage in cor porate illegality will depend on whether there are effective controls in place designed to produce desired behavior. Controls can function in several ways; they can make information and expecta tions about legal behavior clear, they can increase the likelihood of detection, assure the punish ment of transgressions, and reward desired behavior (Finney and Lesieur, 1982; Baucus, 1994). Controls can be external to an organiza tion; vigilant regulatory agencies, substantial monetary penalties for noncompliance, profes sional and accrediting bodies, and media atten tion can be expected to prompt firms to behave legally. Given the budgets and size of regulatory agencies and the often small monetary penalties, external controls are rarely enough to eradicate corporate illegality. Internal controls are also needed; these consist of organizational mecha nisms that inform employees about and norma tively encourage legal behavior, detect transgressions, reward desired behavior through raises and promotions, and discipline those who engage in illegal behavior. Examples of such mechanisms include certain kinds of boards and governance committees; ethical codes; ethical training; performance appraisal systems and promotion criteria that have legal behavior as one of their criteria; ethical hotlines, committees, and audits; and management commitment to legal behavior (McVisk, 1978; Yoder, 1978; Weaver et al., 1999b). There have only been a handful of studies that have examined the role of control systems per organizational illegality. All have focused on internal controls; two examined ethical practices and three looked at Boards of Director structure. Mathews (1987) found no relationship between the content of ethical codes and illegal behavior by corporations. McKendall and Wagner (1997) found that ethical practices (e.g., codes, training, incorporating ethics into selection, appraisal, and discipline processes) produced no linear effects on environmental violations, but did produce first and second-order interactions with a number of motive and opportunity variables. Kesner et al. (1986) found that certain types of board struc ture had no effect on anti-trust violations. Gautschi and Jones' (1987) study revealed that various types of illegality increased as the pro portion of outside directors on boards increased.</page><page sequence="4">370 Marie McKendall et al. McKendall et al. (1999) found that outsider dominance of boards, social responsibility board committees, joint CEO-Chairpersons, and attor neys on boards did not affect legal violations. They did find that the value of stock owned by corporate officers and directors was positively related to serious environmental violations. Despite the very few studies examining or supporting the effects of internal controls on illegal behavior by corporations, it seems to have become widely accepted that internal controls in the form of ethical compliance programs will make a positive difference. The 1991 Corporate Sentencing Guidelines are a reflection of this belief. The 1991 corporate sentencing guidelines The Sentencing Reform Act of 1984 created the United States Sentencing Commission and empowered this Commission to establish sen tencing guidelines for federal judges to follow in order to achieve greater uniformity when sentencing individuals for violations of federal laws. In 1988, the Commission sought to influ ence the actions of organizations by proposing additional guidelines that instructed judges to impose fines on corporations based on the harm caused by the crime, compounded, when appropriate, by a multiplier. In 1989, the Commission published a draft that added both a mandate for large minimum fines and the concept of corporate probation to the guidelines. In response to a negative outcry from the business community, the Commission decided to withdraw the draft and presented a new proposal in March 1990. This draft also called for high fines, however, it placed more emphasis on ethics compliance programs as a way for corporations to reduce fines and avoid future violations (Anonymous, 1996; Carrasco and Dupee, 1999; Oakes, 1999). In November of 1991, the final draft of the guidelines became effective. These guidelines required that a convicted corporation's fine be computed by taking a "base fine" and multi plying it by the corporation's "culpability score." The base fine is set at the greatest of the following: (1) The standard fine imposed for the specific type of violation, or (2) The pecuniary gain to the organization, or (3) The pecuniary loss from the offense caused by the organization, to the extent the loss was caused intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly (U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Sect. 8C2.4(a)). Section 8C2.4(d) sets forth an "Offense Level Fine Table" with base fines ranging from $5000 to $72 500. The base fine, calculated as described above, can be either reduced or increased based upon the organiza tion's "culpability score." The judge deciding the case must apply a culpability score of one to ten or more, with the assumption that the organiza tion's culpability score begins at five. As culpability increases, the fines are multiplied by the amount described in a culpability score table. The multipliers range from 0.05 of the base fine to 4 times the base fine. The fine can therefore be reduced to one-twentieth of the original amount or increased by as much as 400% (Oakes, 1999). In calculating the Culpability Score the court is supposed to add points based on: (l)The size of the organization. (2) The involvement of top organizational officials in the criminal activity. (3) Any prior violations by the organization, and (4) Any obstruction of justice by the organization. The Guidelines also allow the court to consider mitigating factors when setting the fines. The court is allowed to subtract points based on: (1) Whether the organization possessed an "effective program to prevent and detect violations of the law" (2) Whether the organization cooperated in the investigation. (3) Whether the organization voluntarily disclosed its violations; and (4) Whether the organization accepted responsibility for the improper conduct (Oakes, 1999). What do the guidelines consider to be an effective program to prevent and detect violations of the law? This is elaborated on in the official commentary to the guidelines which stated that "the hallmark of an effective program to prevent and detect violations of law is that the organiza tion exercised due diligence in seeking to prevent and detect criminal conduct by its employees and other agents." Due diligence includes the fol lowing:</page><page sequence="5">Ethical Compliance Programs and Corporate Illegality 371 1. The organization must have established compliance standards and procedures to be followed by its employees and other agents that are capable of reducing the prospect of criminal conduct. 2. Specific individual(s) within high-level personnel of the organization must have been assigned overall responsibility to oversee compliance with such standards and procedures. 3. The organization must have used due care not to delegate substantial discretionary authority to individuals whom the organi zation knew, or should have known through the exercise of due diligence, had a propensity to engage in illegal activities. 4. The organization must have taken steps to communicate effectively its standards and procedures to all employees and other agents, e.g., by requiring participation in training programs or by disseminating publications that explain in a practical manner what is required. 5. The organization must have taken reason able steps to achieve compliance with its standards, e.g., by utilizing monitoring and auditing systems reasonably designed to detect criminal conduct by its employees and other agents and by having in place and publicizing a reporting system whereby employees and other agents could report criminal conduct by others within the organization without fear of retribution. 6. The standards must have been consistently enforced through appropriate disciplinary mechanisms, including, as appropriate, discipline of individuals responsible for the failure to detect an offense. Adequate discipline of individuals responsible for an offense is a necessary component of enforcement; however, the form of disci pline that will be appropriate will be case specific. 7. After an offense has been detected, the organization must have taken all reasonable steps to respond appropriately to the offense and to prevent further similar offenses including any necessary modifica tions to its program to prevent and detect violations of law (Official Commentary USSG Sect. 8A1.2(k)(l)-(7)). The Sentencing Guidelines were designed both to encourage corporations to behave legally and to significantly increase the costs of corpo rate misconduct. Have they achieved either of these goals? Presumably, because of the high percentage of cases resolved by plea agreements or guilty pleas, a solid body of case law addressing the application of the Organizational Sentencing Guidelines does not yet exist (Carrasco and Dupee, 1999). There is some evidence that corporate violations of federal law are beginning to cost corporations more in terms of monetary penalties. As of June 30, 1995 (the latest summary we could find), 208 organizations had been sentenced under the Guidelines. A review of these cases indicates that corporations have not been able to reduce their fines in the event of violations. Of the 208 organizations sentenced under the guidelines, almost all were small firms and only one was deemed to have an effective compliance program. Three others claimed to have programs but did not receive mitigation. In 54% of the organizations sentenced, fines were increased because senior executives had high level involvement or knowledge. Approximately 13% of the sentenced corporations received no mitigation for any reason, 61% were placed on corporate probation and 14% were ordered to implement compliance programs. (Anonymous, 1996). Perhaps it can be inferred from the evidence above that the Guidelines are resulting in increased fines for corporate wrongdoing. Are they also prompting corporations to implement programs that will hopefully discourage future criminal activity? The evidence we have on this question is contradictory. Of the 208 sentenced organizations, only four asked for mitigation based on the presence of an effective ethics compliance program. This would indicate that most of the offending organizations didn't have an effective compliance program and knew that they did not; this is probably because they were small firms. However, according to surveys, the primary effect of the guidelines has been the creation or improvement of ethics program by</page><page sequence="6">372 Marie McKendall et al. many companies throughout the U.S. Two studies (cited in Izraeli and Schwartz, 1998) indicate that between 20 and 40% of corpora tions responding to the surveys claim they have either instituted or enhanced their ethics programs as a specific response to the Sentencing Guidelines. Indeed, one author (Nunes, 1995) concluded that, because of the stiff fines the guidelines make possible, the guidelines have essentially imposed a duty on corporations to create an ethics compliance program, and that failure to do so could constitute gross negligence by the board of directors. Given this possible mandate, what kinds of recommendations exist for those companies that wish to establish an ethics compliance program? Creating ethical compliance programs During the last few decades a "business ethics" industry has developed that studies and codifies what is considered ethical behavior in business organizations (Kjonstad and Willmott, 1995). The kinds of ethical compliance programs detailed in the Sentencing Guidelines mirror the type of advice that has been offered to organi zations about how to promote the type of ethical climate that will positively affect employee behavior. Ethics compliance programs are a form of an internal management control system; they specify and communicate objectives, monitor performance, and motivate employees by linking rewards with desired behavior (Lindsay et al., 1996). Ethical codes are arguably the most popular vehicle used by organizations to set objectives and communicate expectations about ethical and legal behavior; in a recent survey of 254 large firms, 78% indicated they had an ethics code (Weaver et al., 1999b). An ethical code can be thought of as "the private laws of a private state"; they detail what are considered right and wrong actions in a given organizational setting (Brien, 1996, p. 25). The literature shows that significant agreement exists on the importance of estab lishing ethical codes that affirm compliance with the law as part of a corporation's operating philosophy (Sanderson and Varner, 1984; Mathews, 1987; Feinberg and Serien, 1988; Trevino et al., 1998). Ethicists have made rec ommendations concerning content, construction, and dissemination of ethical codes. Codes can contain general precepts or they can address and mandate/forbid specific practices. There is general agreement that while a well-developed section addressing moral values and principles should be included in a code of ethics, effective codes must also contain clearly stated provisions that deal with the legalities and ethical concerns of the business (Sanderson and Varner, 1984; Drake and Drake, 1988; Feinberg and Serien, 1988). In addition to statements of espoused values, codes should assure organizational members that implementation and enforcement will be carried out in a known and systematic manner; codes should contain specific language that details sanctions and enforcement provisions and describes methods of investigation and detec tion (Molander, 1987; Weiler, 1988; Buchholz, 1989; Brien, 1996). Other common recommen dations concerning ethical codes is that all level of employees participate in their construction, and that they be reviewed and updated periodi cally (Drake and Drake, 1988; Feinberg and Serien, 1988). Finally, authors agree that in order to create an effective ethical culture, the ethics codes must be regularly publicized and commu nicated (Laczniak, 1983; Molander, 1987; Weiler, 1988; Stevens, 1994). In addition to ethical codes, ethicists argue that top management must become ethical/legal advocates; they must make their own behavior a role model, and the expectation of ethical and legal behavior should be continuously reinforced through specific references by top management in the form of policy statements, speeches, and references (Laczniak, 1983; Waters and Bird, 1987; Brien, 1996; Trevino et al., 1998). Several authors pointed out that it is especially impor tant for top management to address the conflict between profits and moral constraints so that employees become aware that conflicts are not "automatically resolved in favor of the former" (Molander, 1987, p. 625; Waters and Bird, 1987). Accordingly, many ethicists advocate constant communication around the topics of corporate legal and moral obligations. Ethics training</page><page sequence="7">Ethical Compliance Programs and Corporate Illegality 373 programs, workshops, and discussion groups should be used to make conversation about ethics commonplace in corporations (Eckner, 1983; Waters and Bird, 1987; Drake and Drake, 1988; Buchholz, 1989; Brien, 1996). Additional ethical practices commonly pre scribed include mechanisms for measuring ethical/legal performance and for rewarding or punishing behavior. Examples of the measuring function include establishing a system for reporting legal-ethical violations and conducting social audits. Motivating employees to behave legally can be prompted by the incorporation of ethics into selection, performance appraisal, discipline, and job analysis procedures. Expecta tions of legal/ethical behavior should appear on all job descriptions; the capacity for ethical behavior should be a selection criteria for hiring and promotion; adherence to ethics and the law should be incorporated into performance appraisal; and people should be appropriately disciplined for unethical/illegal actions (Laczniak, 1983; Molander, 1987; Goddard, 1988; Buchholz, 1989; Lindsay et al., 1996; Trevino et al., 1999b). Despite the practical importance accorded to ethicality, there has been very little research that attempts to ascertain whether these recom mended practices actually produce any desirable effect on employee behavior. Most research on ethical practices has consisted of analyzing what percentage of companies use various ethical prac tices (Lindsay et al., 1996) content analyzing ethical codes for subject matter (White and Montgomery, 1980; Cressy and Moore, 1983; Sanderson and Varner, 1984), surveying employees for perceptions about their company's ethical codes (Pitt and Groskaufmanis, 1990), case analyses and field interviews (Ermann and Lundman, 1982a, b; Jackall, 1988), or having members of organizations self-report ethical behavior (McCabe et al., 1996). As detailed earlier, only two large scale studies (Mathews, 1987; McKendall and Wagner, 1997) have examined the actual effects of ethical compliance practices on illegal behavior; neither study found that codes or other ethical com pliance practices exerted any main effects on corporate illegality. Despite this lack of empirical evidence, researchers have routinely asserted that ethical climate is likely to exert a strong influence on illegality. The authors of the Sentencing Guidelines obviously believed this, as a company with a substantial ethics compliance program (e.g., ethics code, an ombudsman, a hotline, and mandatory training seminars) could conceivably get a $1 million fine reduced to $50 000 (Hager, 1991). However, in light of the scant research evidence, further empirical investigation is required before such statements can be accepted. Thus, the proposed study hypothesizes: HI: Companies which have well developed ethical codes will have fewer legal viola tions. H2: The more a company, visually and aurally communicates about ethics, the fewer legal violations the company will have. H3: The more a company formally trains its employees about ethics, the fewer legal violations the company will have. H4: The more a company formally includes ethics in its selection, discipline, perfor mance appraisal, job description, and other organizational processes, the fewer legal violations the company will have. Methodology Sample Our sample was chosen from Wards Business Directory (1988), which lists the largest 1000 U.S. based firms, according to sales data. Since our study used OSHA violations, we first elim inated any company whose primary Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) Code was not in manufacturing. We then eliminated firms whose activities were too dispersed to track effectively, i.e., less than fifty percent of business was con ducted by the parent company or a single sub sidiary. Finally, we removed from the sample any company that had been acquired by another</page><page sequence="8">374 Marie McKendall et al. company or gone private during our five year sample period. This left us with a total sample of 315 companies. A questionnaire about ethical practices used by the company was sent to a key informant in each organization; these informants were either high ranking members of the Human Resource Department, corporate counsels, or people the company had designated as ethics specialists. Informants were instructed to give the ques tionnaire to another person, if appropriate. We received usable responses from 108, for a return rate of 34%. The use of self-report data sometimes raises concerns about reliability, but survey questions used were quite specific and addressed factual information, which reduces the potential for inflated correlations (Crampton and Wagner, 1994). The cover letter that was sent with the survey indicated only that the survey was inves tigating the presence of ethical practices in organizations; it did not ask any questions about personal behavior, ethical problems, or OSHA violations. The survey was confidential, reducing the potential for social desirability bias. Respondents were assured that individual responses would not be linked with the organi zation. Thus, there was no incentive for the respondents to exaggerate the prevalence of their ethics programs. Dependent variable Detected violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act during 1989, 1990, and 1991 served as our independent variable; the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is the agency responsible for ensuring that all United States employees have a safe and healthy work environment. OSHA was created in 1971 and the agency establishes protective standards, enforces those standards, and offers firms and employees technical assistance and consultation programs. The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 encourages states to develop and operate their own programs; OSHA approves and monitors such plans (hhtp://www.osha.gov/about.html). In Fiscal Year 2000, OSHA inspected 36 350 workplaces. The 26 states with their own OSHA programs conducted an additional 54 510 inspections. Once a violation is detected, OSHA categorizes the violation as willful, serious, repeat, or other. Willful violations are those that the employer intentionally and knowingly commits; they carry penalties of $5000 to $70 000. A serious violation means that death or serious physical harm could easily be the result of the violation and that the employer knew, or should have known, of the hazard; these viola tions carry a mandatory penalty of up to $7000. A repeat violation involves any previous viola tion where, upon reinspection, a substantially similar violation is found. Repeat violations can bring penalties of up to $70 000. Finally, "other" violations are actions that have a direct relation ship to safety and health, but probably would not cause death or serious physical harm; penalties are discretionary and range up to $7000 (hhtp://www.osha.gov/about.html). Secretary of Labor Elaine L. Chao has made clear that under her leadership, "Our first respon sibility will always be to protect workers by enforcing our nation's labor laws." She has also emphasized her interest in enforcing the law "using common sense, not just a reflexive, one-size-fits-all approach to every situation" (hhtp://www.osha.gov/about.html, 1) This type of case by case so-called "common sense" approach is characteristic of Republican appointees. What is termed a violation is influenced by politics and the resources allotted to OSHA during each administration. Since each administration only lasts 4?8 years, policies do shift, and there is no way to completely remove these factors from violation counts. Our viola tions were measured from 1989-1991, all during the Bush administration, so political fluctuations were minimized as much as possible. Because the Sentencing Guidelines became effective in November of 1991; we chose to study violations from 1989-1991 in order to eliminate confounding effects. We wanted to focus on whether ethics programs affect the frequency and severity of corporate illegal actions. After the passage of the guidelines, com panies might have committed fewer violations</page><page sequence="9">Ethical Compliance Programs and Corporate Illegality 375 because they feared the high fines mandated by the guidelines and they might have implemented ethics programs in order to mitigate their liability in case of a violation. We would not have been able to separate these effects from the question of whether or not ethics programs actually work to reduce legal violations. We obtained the number of OSHA violations by searching the Enforcement Action Data Base that is maintained by OSHA and available through their web site. The data base lists all inspections, complaints, and state and federal actions against all U.S. companies.1 We identified 9093 total OSHA violations during 1989-1991 for our sample of 108 companies. OSHA classifies violations in one of four ways, as serious, willful, repeat, or "other". Of our 9093 violations, there were 4182 serious violations, 138 willful, 379 repeat, and 4394 other violations. There was a total of 1400 complaints filed against our sample companies; some did not result in a charge of violation(s). Because larger firms have more opportunity to commit violations, we used a proportionate violation measure. Our dependent variable is stated as the number of serious, willful, repeat, and other violations for each year per $100 million of sales. We added the counts from 1989-1991 to arrive at the company total for each kind of violation. It should be noted that our work can use only detected violations as the dependent variable. It is unrealistic to expect that the staff of OSHA can detect all violations of safety and health regulations. Consequently, our study, like all others on corporate legality, most likely under states the true incidence of violations for each firm. OSHA detections, however, represent the best proxy we have available. Independent variable Ethical practices served as our independent variable. Because we are using a predictive model, our independent and control variables were measured in 1987 and 1988, our survey was administered during a two month period at the end of 1987/beginning of 1988, and our dependent variable (OSHA violations) was measured in 1989, 1990, and 1991. A forty-seven item objective questionnaire entitled "The Role of Ethics in Business" was developed to measure the presence and degree of ethical practices in corporations.2 Specifically, the instrument assessed corporate practices in four areas: 1) ethics codes (questions about presence, development, content and revision: 0 to 13 points); 2) communication about ethics (questions about type and frequency of communica tion: 0 to 20 points); 3) ethics training (questions about type and frequency of training, who must attend: 0 to 19 points); 4) inclusion of ethics in human resource and organizational practices (questions about the inclusion of ethics in performance appraisal, selection process, job descrip tions, discipline processes, audits, hotlines, suggestion systems: 0 to 12 points). Our sample organizations therefore received a total ethics program compliance score and a score in each of the four areas (codes, communication, training, processes). The forty-seven items yielded a total possible score ranging from 0 to 65; we interpreted higher scores as indicative of more comprehensive levels of ethical compliance programs. Control variables We decided to use as controls the variables which have been found by a majority of studies to be related to corporate illegality. A description of each of these variables follows. Firm profits: Firm profits was calculated as a company's average return on assets during 1987 and 1988. We used data from Moody's Industrial Reports and annual reports to obtain the data. Industry profits: Industry profits was calculated as the average return on assets for the company's primary four-digit SIC code during 1987 and</page><page sequence="10">376 Marie McKendall et al. 1988, using Dun and Bradstreet's Industry Norms and Key Business Ratios. Firm size: Firm size as calculated as the average number of employees for each firm during 1987 and 1988, using Moody's Industrial Reports and annual reports. Industry SIC: It is conceivable that, because of more inherently dangerous manufacturing processes, some firms might be at a greater risk of OSHA violations than others in a different industry. Unfortunately, OSHA's only criterion is that if the industry has more than the average number of violations, it is considered high-risk. If an industry has more than average violations because of a manufacturing process, then it is fair to partial that out. If, however, an industry has more than average violations because the industry has a criminal culture or because of its concen tration ratio, or its profits are down, that variance should not be partialed out. Since there is no way to sort it out, we proceeded by designating any SIC code that had more than twice the expected amount of violations as "high-risk" and dummy coded those four SIC codes (20, 33, 34, 37). Analysis and results Means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations of all variables are shown in Table I. While many studies use Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regres sion to analyze data, a major assumption of OLS is that the data approximate a normal distribu tion. When that assumption is violated, the results produced will be biased. A normal distribution requires the data, when displayed as a histogram, to be symmetrical and unimodal, with the height of the curve dropping off rapidly from the peak, forming thin unbounded tails at both ends of the distribution (Enns, 1985). In our study there was significant truncation of the dependent variables at zero. Of 108 companies, 15 (13.9%) had no serious violations, 91 (84.3%) had no willful violations, 71 (65.7%) had no repeat violations, and 15 (13.9%) had no "other" violations. Clearly, our data did not meet the criteria for a normal distribution, thus we turned to a TOBIT regression model (Maddala, 1982). The TOBIT model with maximum likelihood estimation adjusts the regression coefficients to allow for data that is truncated (Maddala, 1982). To identify that the analysis was done with the TOBIT procedure instead of OLS, the amount of variance explained by the regression equation is reported as a "pseudo R2" instead of the traditional R2 reported in OLS. The pseudo R2 is a more conservative measure in that it under states the amount of variance explained. As shown in Table II, the hypotheses were not supported for any type of OSHA violation or complaint. While the inclusion of ethics in organizational processes was significantly related to willful violations, it was positive instead of negative. The presence of training about ethics did approach a low level of significance, and as expected, this relationship was negative. Of the control variables, only an organization's profitability was significant in predicting willful and repeat violations, in that lower firm prof itability was associated with more violations. The average industry ROA had no impact on any of the dependent variables. The average number of employees approached a low level of significance for serious and "other" violations, as well as the number of complaints; organizations with fewer employees were more likely to have a higher number of violations and complaints. Discussion This study did not support the commonly held assumption that the presence of vehicles and practices that focus on ethics in an organization will result in behavioral changes by employees. We examined whether the presence of ethical codes, communication about ethics, ethics training, and incorporating ethics into human resources practices make a difference in the fre quency of serious, willful, repeat, and other OSHA violations. The ethical compliance vehicles that we studied mirror the recommen dations made in the Uniform Sentencing Guidelines, with the exception of appointing a specific individual with responsibility for the</page><page sequence="11">TABLE I Means, standard deviations, and intercorrelations of all variables Variables Mean S.D. 1 10 11 12 1.

The results of a TOBIT regression analyses indicated that ethical com pliance programs did not lessen legal violations. The two other studies that examined the impact of ethical practices on illegal behavior also found no significant main effects. There are several possible explanations for these results. First, it may be that ethical emphasis and prac tices are, for the most part, genuinely unrelated to corporate illegality. Although many authors have maintained that ethical practices will produce a more moral and law-abiding corpo rate culture, others do not see any reason to automatically assume that compliance programs will produce a behavioral outcome. These authors feel that attempting to "implant" an ethical culture within an organization is a fairly useless endeavor, and can even be detrimental. Molander (1987) argued that ethical codes are not effective for a number of reasons. He con tended that people know right from wrong, and are indifferent to codes; establishing rules doesn't automatically guarantee compliance. Further more, codes often do more harm than good because if something isn't specifically covered in a code, it is considered fair game. Magnet (1986) held that the goal of a strong corporate culture capable of shaping individuals' behavior can be dangerous because it fosters the notion that individual employees are not responsible for their actions. Ott (1989) and Drake and Drake (1988) argued that there is often a difference between stated values and operating behavior. Peoples' underlying assumptions determine their core beliefs and patterns of behavior; codes, training, and speeches are unlikely to change those fun damental assumptions. A survey of 87 managers (Jose and Thibodeux, 1999) revealed that almost half of them believed that value systems are formed early and are not susceptible to change. Finally, ethical compliance programs may not work because they seldom address the causes of illegal or unethical conduct (Paine, 1994). Another reason why significant results did not emerge may have to do with the type of viola tion studied. It may be that ethical compliance practices will have an impact on the type of violations that are specifically addressed in ethical codes. A review of the studies that performed content analysis of ethical codes showed firms concentrate on self-protection; most ethical codes prohibit behavior against the firm that might impact profits, such as bribery and kickbacks, illegal political payments, conflict of interest, or misuse of corporate assets (Stevens, 1994). Perhaps employees are taking their cue from their organizations; if a firm does not identify safety and health as an ethical obligation, employees might not be as concerned with it as the types of behaviors that are specifically mentioned. Third, it may be ethics compliance programs, although necessary, are not what is most impor tant in promoting ethical and legal behavior. If meaningful ethics programs are to be developed, they must be supported by top management; this factor is more important than external controls such as the sentencing guidelines (Weaver et al., 1999a). Institutionalizing ethics involves more than codes and training; it must be supported by a culture change and examples of ethical leadership from top management. The Jose and Thibodeux (1999) survey of mangers found that 96.5% thought that genuine top management support was necessary if an organization is to become more ethical; this was ranked as far more important than codes, training, etc. In 1983 interviews with 64 retired Fortune 500 middle managers, Clinard found that the behavior and philosophy of top management was mentioned most often as the reason for unethical or illegal behavior. If employees think that top manage ment is the key to organizational ethics, and the behavior of top management does not match the behavior advocated by ethics programs, this discrepancy will probably be enough to render the ethics program fairly useless. This might be a major problem; in a survey of 254 Fortune 1000 firms, respondents indicated that the CEO appeared largely uninvolved and unconcerned with ethical matters (Weaver et al., 1999b). Indeed, a growing number of researchers have charged that the purpose of corporate ethical practices is not foremost and genuinely to promote ethical behavior. Instead, they are used to differentiate firms from their competitors (Barker, 1993), or more recently, to mitigate damages under the Uniform Sentencing Guidelines (Izraeli and Schwartz, 1998). Weaver</page><page sequence="14">380 Marie McKendall et al. et al. (1999a) argued that ethics programs can serve as window dressing and have little to do with a firm's customary operating behavior; programs can easily be marginalized and discon nected from real expectations and norms. They can be used merely as a way to "check off" the recommendations of the sentencing guidelines. The one result we did obtain was that the more firms incorporate ethics into their organizational practices, the more likely they are to have willful and repeat OSHA violations. Since willful vio lations seem like the kind to most likely involve management complicity, we can speculate that corporations may indeed be using ethics com pliance programs as a distracter from or a cover-up of purposeful illegal action. Research which tests the perceived ethics of top manage ment against actual violations would be a useful endeavor. Ethical compliance programs arguably have two purposes. First they are useful in preventing behavior that is accepted to be criminally or morally defective; in order to do so, programs establish, rules, monitor behavior, and punish transgressions. Codes of ethics, for instance, usually specify the requirement to obey the law, and prescribe the limits of discretionary decision. The second purpose of ethical programs is to create a commitment to shared values, to develop people's capacity to engage in moral reasoning, and to create an environment that enables responsible conduct (Reed and Anthony, 1992; Paine, 1994; Kjonstad and Willmott, 1995; Weaver et al., 1999a). Many argue that typical ethical compliance programs are seriously lacking in the second function; they concentrate too much on what shouldn't be done and do not rise to the level of articulating or communicating moral values and beliefs (Stevens, 1994). Training courses in ethics stress compliance with codes instead of thoughtful reflection on moral action. Ethical compliance programs are designed to instruct people about ethics and legality and to offer them rules to follow rather than help them exercise moral judgement (Kjonstad and Willmott, 1995). As valid as these criticisms may be, it is impor tant to note that, based on the few studies that have been done, ethical compliance practices are not even working successfully in their restrictive function, i.e., they do not discourage people from violating the law. Corporations that have followed all the guidelines about how to design and implement compliance programs do not have fewer legal violations. Given these results, it is questionable that the sentencing guidelines provide for a drastic mitigation of damages if a corporation has a comprehensive ethical com pliance program. If these programs do not make a difference, then such a provision only encour ages compliance programs as window dressing, and it creates a false sense of having done something that will result in a more law-abiding organization. And, perhaps most importantly, it may result in less motivation to discover and design vehicles that will genuinely work to promote ethical behavior and legal compliance.
