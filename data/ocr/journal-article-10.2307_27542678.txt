<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE IONIANS AND THE HOUSING OF THEIR GODS By HOWARD BAKER Prefatory Note ITH the indulgence of the reader I will claim as the premise for this chronicle the sort of proposition which Vitruvius established in his De Architectural architecture is concerned with much more than the foundation, the walls and roof, the columns and pediments, of a building. What goes inside the building, what surrounds it on the outside, has to be regarded as inseparable from its design. And ultimately, from my point of view, if it is a Greek temple, the soul of the people who are building it and fitting it out for their gods presides over the structure. It is a religious expression; and I hope that heaven will forgive me for presuming to try to elucidate it as such. In talking about Greek temples one has to rely on an imperfect blending of the little that is still to be seen up and down the Mediterranean and the plenty that is to be gathered from refer ence works. These being the implacable circumstances, it will be convenient, I believe, to give at the outset an account of the particular books which seem at the present time to be most repre sentative of the excellences of ancient architecture. The books of greatest interest include a number of exquisitely learned mono graphs and many more brilliantly illustrated volumes, ranging from European booklets and American paperbacks to sumptuous New York and London folios, sometimes in translation, often with the printing and plate-making done in the presses of the Continent. There is material in abundance for the study of the objects in which the ancient world expressed its religious genius. The new visibility of the past is what I hope to convey in the narrative which follows. It's as if anyone working his way through the new books may sometimes catch the gleam of the w</page><page sequence="2">556 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS flame on the altar and smell the smoke and hear the foot-beat and the chant?thanks to archaeology, the camera, and the book industry. Of course the new books require the support of the old books. If Miss Gisela Richter makes Pausanius more in formative, the contrary is also true. The Loeb Library's De scription of Greece hangs like a stiff and pleasantly distorted backdrop behind most of what can be learned about the world of the Hellenes. To have written about the lonians and their gods just a few years ago, before the triumphs of archaeology and color photography, was almost inevitably to have been cramped by the tradition of Sir James Frazer and Jane Harrison, in which, it has seemed to me, religion became a complex of ancient myths and rituals, rather murky goings-on, of more interest for their novelty and remoteness than for their pertinence to our own understand ing of ourselves in relation to the past. But now the evidence of visible masonry seems to give a more just sense of Greek preoccupations than literary allusions to rituals, which are often confused and hard to date. For example: the temple of Sunium poised on its promontory south of Athens, by its definite compact clarity against the sky, challenges even today the stranger looking up at it from the angle of an approaching ship, reminding him of what were once presumed to be the inviolable prerogatives of Attic citizens3 while out on the island of Samos the gigantic marble jewels which have toppled among the Venus-bushes and the reeds in the bright sea-glitter, bespeak, even today, a beauty and a leisured reasonableness the like of which is hardly to be found anywhere else. With the importance of the physical aspect of things in mind, anyone who examines the appended book-list will be aware of a problem. The best of the new publications are expensive, so ex pensive that I have felt compelled to omit some choice titles. While the high cost of producing illustrated books is understand able, excessive list prices will inevitably force the student out of</page><page sequence="3">HOWARD BAKER 557 his study and into an institutional library (which may not be able to afford a good many of them either), and all of the benefits of relaxed, prolonged inquiry will be lost. Some pricing makes not too much sense. Of the two older, wholly reliable books on ancient architecture, W. B. Dinsmoor's and D. S. Robertson's, the first has gone into a reprint edition at $20.00, the second into a re issue in substantial paperback at $3.95. Both are invaluable to the student; both are equally valuable just as reference books. The following, then, is a short, informal list in which I hope I have indicated a few of the titles that seem to be especially re warding from all points of view. I use the term "folio" to describe the large, excellently illustrated volumes. Since price listings for books made and sold abroad are generally unavailable at the present time, I give only the prices of publications which are on sale in the United States, and even these prices will probably be changed before this list appears in print. i. E. Homan-Wederking, The Art of Archaic Greece, translated by J. R. Foster, New York (Crown Publishers, Inc.), 1968, 224 pages, ?6.95. This is a volume in a series originating in Germany called "Art of the World: the Historical, Sociological and Religious Back grounds of European Cultures". True to the intention of the pub lisher, Homan-Wederking recounts the complex archaic experience most effectively, giving appropriate emphasis to the Eastern Greeks; and the publisher in his turn has been generous in provid ing illustrations which are well selected and beautifully reproduced. 2. Karl Schefold, Myth and Legend in Early Greek Art, translated by Audrey Hicks, New York (Harry N. Abrams, Inc.), [1966], 201 large pages, #12.50. The ceaseless interplay of myth with religion goes without saying. This volume, together with the one I describe above, presents a comprehensive view of the Greek landscape with archaic figures busy in it. 3. Arnold W. Lawrence, Greek Architecture, Baltimore (Pelican Books), 1957, 527 pages, $20.00. Lawrence brings architecture up to date in ways which cannot be expected of the two standard texts that I mentioned earlier; but more important in my opinion is his ability to attach architecture to a physical background and an his torical situation with a relevance which did not exist in the imagina tions of the first specialists. In this connection I should add that Vincent Scully in The Earth, the Temple, and the Gods (New York: 4</page><page sequence="4">553 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS Praeger, 1969, 271 pages and 456 figures, #16.00) carries the new conception of a temple merging into a landscape into a realm of Freudian absurdities, seeing the tumultuous Greek countryside as a composition of phallic and mammillary shapes, which in itself is not absurd; but visualized thus it loses its distinctive features and all temples begin to look alike. (The items which I number 4 and 5 are two choices among the many fine studies of the inwardness of the simpler Greek people and the curious outward expressions in which it often manifested itself.) 4.

Villard, Archaic Greek Art: 620 420 B. C, London (Thames and Hudson), 1971, 438 pages. This lavish folio, of which Jean Charbonneaux, the great curator of the Louvre, is principal editor, displays a panorama which has been hard for German- and English-speaking scholars to bring into focus; namely, the manifest gaiety and gallantry of the Aegean people which came out even, or perhaps especially, in the way in which they fashioned their temple and grave ornaments. 11. Gisela M. A. Richter, The Archaic Gravestones of Attica, London (Phaidon), 1961, 184 pages with 216 illustrations in black-and white. Miss RichterV Kouroi (1942, revised i960) and Korai</page><page sequence="5">HOWARD BAKER 559 (1968) are particularly eminent works on early Greek sculpture. However, since the emphasis in these volumes is basically on a chronological framework founded on anatomical details, more to our purpose is her elegant folio on archaic stele, which, perhaps be cause of the universality of a stylized grave marker, is as relevant to the Greeks of Samos as to the Greeks of Athens. 12. Karl Lehmann and Phyllis Williams Lehmann, Samothrace, Prince ton University Press (The Bollingen Series), 8 volumes, 1958-1969, $87.50. I recommend these sumptuous reports as examples of de votion to the science of archaeology: the personal devotion of the late Karl Lehmann and of Mrs. Lehmann and their many assist ants, the institutional devotion of New York University and the Bollingen Foundation who sponsored and publicized a dig that went on unwearied through three decades. Although the ways in which these excavations will contribute to our knowledge of the Hellenistic period can scarcely be assessed so soon, the schooling which Professor Lehmann was able to offer his young staff is prov ing to be of great immediate importance. The scene has shifted from Samothrace to Cnidus, the wealthy, well-planned city on the southwest tip of Asia Minor, which archaeologists from Long Island University are in the act of uncovering. And so, if the gods permit, we may find out more about the Aphrodite of Praxiteles, the most celebrated ancient statue, and more about Eudoxus, the most un rivaled of ancient mathematicians and astronomers. I don't know which of them did the city the greater honor, the goddess or the man. First Part Though far away, beyond our ever finding out} walking noiselessly, may the gods still lead our destinies to just ends. Religion is always the biggest problem. A fresh look at a structure of beliefs which flourished at the beginning of our his tory as westerners founding a new civilization would surely be pertinent to the uneasy religious temper of the twentieth century. This look would be an attempt to see into an almost forgotten state of mind that prevailed before Plato and Aristotle planted, consecutively, the concepts of eternal Ideas and an eternal Mover which exist beyond space and beyond time: which is to say, quite a while before Christianity undertook to marry these premises with Hebrew monotheism. An inquiry</page><page sequence="6">560 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS might profitably limit itself to the pre-Classical period, to the interval which was at once the time of the ripening of the finest archaic arts and of the beginnings of science and philosophy in Ionia. The island of Samos can serve most conveniently as representative of Ionia, and the forms of Greek architecture as the nexus of the whole subject. I The ancient Samians, along with all Ionians, were great makers of festivals, and great builders of sanctuaries, and great honorers of the gods. With the arrival of archaic times in the seventh and sixth centuries B. C, their religious observances seem to have shed the grimmer vestments of the primitive cults and to have become relaxed and easy, lavish, elegant, cheerful, though never giving a man much reason to be optimistic about his ultimate end. The human being was turned loose. And left more or less on his own, he could do nicely, except for that one last pang, which was inevitable anyhow. The gods often befriended him, and he was happy to render them their dues of gratitude. It was an informal contract, lacking both the fierce spirituality of the creeds with which we have grown familiar, and equally the dark sensual ism of the earlier rites. It affected all manifestations of Eastern Greek life, not excluding the inquiries of the philosophers?the worldly, mimetic, wonder-inspiring, and very social thing that it was. And it is with it in mind as such, as a well-tuned civiliz ing instrument, that I undertake to describe the affair of the Ionians with their gods and the style of the things with which they thought it proper to surround them. It has been argued that this affair was not religious, that this breed of East Greeks was not religious at all. Obviously they were a people who were strongly inclined toward irony and skepticism, and toward delight in an erotic "Milesian" sort of tale: "Ionian minstrels were fundamentally irreligious," in the judgment of Martin Nilsson; " . . . the holy wedding of Zeus</page><page sequence="7">HOWARD BAKER 561 and Hera is made rather a sensual love affair." Nilsson, how ever, as a specialist in the most primitive phases of religion, was seeing the problem from an oblique point of view. Burlesque, as in Homer, did no doubt play fast and loose with the ancient sanctities. But from another point of view we can see that Greek society, once it became literate, learned to relish a sort of vivacious profanity, an errant levity, just as many robust societies have en joyed their own extravagant Feasts of Fools, in which decorum is turned upside down. And contrariwise only the most cramped of Republics would consider the expurgation of Homer an ideo logical necessity. For people of open minds and open tempera ments the gods could hardly be taken so literally as to make spoofing a capital offense. Whether the brighter lonians were finally religious or irre ligious, we won't try to decide, the distinction being at best a matter of lonely, subjective opinion, and of a piece with man's native irrationality toward other men and their beliefs. But the plain objective fact is that celebrations pertaining to the Olympian cults went on and on in Ionia, undiminished and not visibly cor rupted in the period of skepticism and mockery. Our purpose is to inquire into the poise that controlled these celebrations, and the relation of this poise with other manifestations of these people, such as their disinterested curiosity about the world, their equanimity toward awesome phenomena, their love of beauty, and their devotion to the powers of the mind and the hand and the senses all fused together in the production of buildings and the fittings for buildings. We will try to say who the lonians were, and how, in the first blaze of our fragile civilization, they consolidated so many things with such enviable success. II The people whose ancestors brought their language and cus toms to the westernmost seaboard of Asia believed that their stock originated on the mainland of Greece?in fact, in Athens</page><page sequence="8">562 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS itself, according to Herodotus, their Athenian descent being proved by their calendar and their practice of maintaining old clan ties in the annual feast called Apaturia. Other very strong traditions connected some groups with Pylos, Nestor's famous Pylos, and enlightened Argolis, and a few lesser places. The Samians associated themselves with ancient Argos and their Hera with the Argive Hera. The non-Athenian contingents may have consolidated their Ionic characteristics during a half-remembered stopover in Athens. In any event migrants started moving out eastward from the mainland, so that sooner or later lonians in the broader sense of the name found themselves scattered along the island route between Attica and Asia Minor, with Delos and the temples of Apollo forming the axis on which their comings and goings turned. Most probably they followed a course which travellers have always followed, hopping from island to island as did your steamship of yesterday, touching Syros and Mykonos, making the devout excursion to Delos, continuing on to Icaria and finally Samos, whence they spread out up and down the neighboring coastal lands, taking up their habitations and inter marrying with the native women. The first migrations must have happened in the earliest Dark Ages, around 1000 B. C, when the Dorians were breaking into the central establishments in the west, and naturally must have included many bypaths. But before long the migrating Greeks had planted themselves firmly in the centers which were soon to comprise the Panionian League, and by archaic times this circle of cities had become Ionia in the narrow sense of the term. The league consisted of an exclusive alliance of twelve brilliant, small and not-so-small places, the resounding roster of which from north to south runs as follows: Phocaea and Clazomenae on the Gulf of Smyrna, now Izmir j Erythrae, opposite Chios ; Teos, Lebedos, Colophon, and Ephesus, along the ragged coast above the swampy delta of the Cayster river, now known as the "Little Maeander"; Priene, Myus, and Miletus on the flat lands</page><page sequence="9">HOWARD BAKER 563 and marshes of the Greater Maeander above and below lofty Mount Mycale; then, just outside the coastline, the two islands, Chios and Samos. Eighty-five miles of the globe's surface stretched between the northernmost and the southernmost settle ment. Pretty tight quarters, one would think, considering all that was to go on there. Even in early times the newcomers prospered. One of their number, in a period which is now quite obscure, put precisely everything which was most important to their minds and hearts together for them in the celebrations of those ancestors of theirs who had had to do with the sack of Troy: Homer, if not from Chios then from somewhere not far away, brought them an un limited wealth of consciousness, which they were bound to share promptly with all Greeks and before long with a multitude of barbarians. In a similarly obscure interval the first of the great works of Samos was taking shape. In the early eighth century a hundred foot, central-columned structure dedicated to Hera is identifiable as the earliest temple in Ionia, and, in view of its size and its subsequent evolution, it appears to be a prototype of the great temples of the Greek world. An Ionic way of doing things, which was at once spacious and full of fine detail, took hold of the imaginations of these people. Under the generous unagitated beauty of the goddess Hera, they learned to underscore and en rich the traditions they had brought with them from the plains below Mycenae. They were stimulated by the strange styles of their Oriental neighbors. With the clarities of sunlight and sea hanging around them, they were ready to go to work on all sorts of arts. Ill In the famous days of Samos, particularly during the middle and second half of the sixth century B. C, we can visualize, on the south side of the island, a few miles of marble-sanded, well</page><page sequence="10">564 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS watered seashore lying under green, steeply-terraced hills, with the cluster of white-columned temples at one end and the gray walled city of Polycrates at the other. Between the two stretched that remarkable feature of ancient places, a Sacred Way. Today the grandeurs of the Heraion are still sketched out in the drums and blocks of stone scattered on the ground ? and though the palace of Polycrates, which provoked admiration for a number of centuries, has now disappeared, there still remains the neat little naval basin which sheltered his boar-snouted warships. But of the Sacred Way and its wonders no sign is left. It was a broad ribbon of dry pavement which on leaving the city passed tomb and grave monuments that were works of exquisite artistry. As memorials to the dead the stylized portrait statues of naked kouros and elegantly draped kore would have been impressive 5 and the stelai would have been wonder-provoking and curiously striking from our point of view: simple, tall shafts of marble which seem to bespeak archaic orderliness at its most powerful. The graceful white shaft stood taller than the man it commemorated ; usually it was undecorated on Samos, merely naming the deceased and rising plain and polished to a crowning sculpture. There, on the top, Ionic volutes in various combinations supported a flat, widely spreading, perfectly sym metrical palmette. It is as if the gravestone wanted to make only one comment: "Just like the race of leaves, is that of man" {Iliad VI, 146)5 recalling vanished life in the summary form of the uplifted palm leaf. Passing on across a strip of fertile soil where the grape has flourished for no one knows how long, the roadway led among statue groups into the precincts of the temple. Those of the statues which have survived more or less intact, like the Geneleos group in the Vathy museum, are large, forcefully imagined figures. This one comprises a family group in the archaic style. Between a sitting and a reclining person stood four younger people, all frontally posed, each spaced off clearly from the others, with</page><page sequence="11">HOWARD BAKER 565 no byplay of story-telling detectable in the whole, and no refer ence to the quaint aspects of personality. This is the wonder of the art of this period j its effect is that of calm timelessness, and it harmonized perfectly with the open-air setting and the in comparable Aegean scene. But the Sacred Way most importantly was the avenue for the great processions. Of course when people travelled in groups, bringing large retinues with them or being part of a retinue (as in Euripides' Ion), their object being to carry gifts to the temple and dedicate them, then every day could be a procession day 5 and judging by the number of dedicatory objects that have been un earthed in Samos, this must have been pretty much the case. There were two great Samian festivals, however, and each had its procession. The first, centering on the marriage of Zeus and Hera, came in the springtime 5 the other was a midsummer event in which, through a ceremony of washing the cult statue, Hera's virginity would be restored to her so that she could marry Zeus all over again the following spring; thus the repetitious fecund work of the years would go on and on in its allotted way. Al though the enactments of the Hera myths were doubtless brilliant spectacles, what remained particularly memorable was the proces sion with which the festival began. That old connoisseur of splendors Athenaeus, writing on the luxurious practices of various peoples, finds Samian luxury summed up eloquently in the proverb "Marching to the Heraion with braided hair". From him we can gather that the populace of the city assembled in the market-place on the morning of the first day of the festival, and then in the strict and yet elegant style that had become conventional they marched out the Sacred Way. The young women wore their hair in carefully formed locks combed down over their breasts and shoulders, with a fillet or embroidered band or golden clasp to keep it perfectly in place. Snowy sheer clinging chitons dropped from their shoulders in lightly rippling folds to the ground. Golden bracelets of fine</page><page sequence="12">566 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS workmanship encircled their arms. The young men, with hair no less elaborately arranged, went forth bare-limbed in sketchy armor: "Warriors advancing with light steps, shield-protected," says the Samian poet Asius (whom Athenaeus quotes), mocking the youths with the double meanings implicit in a line from a somber battle scene in the Iliad (XIII, 158). And so they went, girls and boys, men, women and children. Many carried fruits or small animals, gifts which would become part of the feast. The ox-drawn car was a fixture in such a march, along with hand some larger animals which were to be sacrificed to the gods, roasted, and devoured alfresco by the human celebrants. On one well-remembered occasion things went wrong, as they were inclined to do from time to time among the Greeks,, then as now. The Samians were at war with some of their neighbors to the north, and, fearing the disaster of a sudden raid upon the procession, they considered cancelling the festivities for that year. Their military commander, however, a certain Syloson who was perhaps the first to bear that dubious name, assured them com plete protection, and the march took place as usual, quite peace fully. But once Syloson had delivered the procession to the Heraion, he returned to the city, called in his sailors from the triremes, and in the night seized the fortifications which domi nated the capital. The next morning out at the Heraion the Sa mians were informed that their government had become a mili tary dictatorship. IV In festival time the Heraion was the center for a sort of camp meeting where various groups lived together intimately under temporary roofs ranging, according to hints in the written record, from reed mats to fine tapestries. Innkeepers set up in business, offering specialties in food and drink. Small merchants sold the curious wares that could be brought profitably from afar; an ex cellent business was to be had, for example, in statuettes and small</page><page sequence="13">HOWARD BAKER 567 sculptures for dedications. Money appears to have been ex changed, big deals set up; the mysterious wealthy could dicker with a sculptor over the commission of a colossal statue like those they saw everywhere around them. Strabo later on came out with something like the unchanging facts of the case when he called the Ionian festival of Apollo at Delos a fair: a fair with its shadier aspects as well as its religious connotations. So too doubt less for Samos. Although the marriage of Zeus and Hera might be reenacted in circumstances which could resemble those in Ben Jonson's Bartholomew Fair, still the enormous presence of the main temple, the five or six secondary temples, the statue groups, the dancing plaza and the great altar, the numerous treasure houses, would impose a superior style and order on the general liveli ness of the holiday. Frivolities could hardly negate the power of the superb architecture in the background. In fact frivolities, as in the epic world of Odysseus, must be construed as a human izing dimension in the whole. That dimension, that self-correcting byplay between the solemn and the frivolous, is exactly what is most discernible in the Homeric Hymn to the Delian Apollo, which is beyond all doubt the earliest, the most extensive and most authentic, and most pleasant, document dealing with the personality of Ionia?unless it be the utterly complex Homeric epics themselves. As for the Hymn, it relates a simple story, telling how many a rich and famous place, knowing the jealousies among the gods, fearfully turned Leto away when she was in travail with Apollo, until at last tiny, sea-girt Delos, with its one palm tree, accepted her 5 but, even then, it was not until Delos had bargained ingenuously with Leto, forcing her to swear a great oath granting the island pri ority over the other sites which would also claim the unborn god. With that, Leto labored nine days and nights ; and at last Apollo was born. The Hymn starts toward a conclusion with a joyous address to</page><page sequence="14">568 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS the grown god Phoebus Apollo, praising him with the brilliant epithets which he had acquired. Then it tells how the Ionians meet in Delos to make festival in his honor. The tone of the ac count, with its delicate mixtures of light and shadow, is altogether important ; la the interests of objectivity I refrain from setting down my own version of the passage in which the Ionians are characterized. This is the Loeb translation word for word; the translator is H. G. Evelyn-White: Many are your temples and wooded groves, and all peaks and towering bluffs of lofty mountains and rivers flowing into the sea are dear to you, Phoebus, yet in Delos do you most delight your heart; for there the long-robed Ionians gather in your honor with their children and shy wives, mindful, they delight you with boxing and dancing and song, so often as they hold their gathering. A man would say that they were deathless and unaging if he should then come upon the Ionians so met together. For he would see the graces of them all, and would be pleased in heart gazing at the men and well-girded women with their swift ships and great wealth. Thus the festival: games, feasting, dancing and song, with many caiques on the sea and madding crowds on land. The image of the long-robed Ionian can be studied, still with an animated existence all its own, in the bronze statue of the flute player from Samos, now in the National Archaeological Museum in Athens. The women are complimented with an epic expression, "beauti fully girdled", which may refer literally to the Ionic habit of belting the chiton around the waist so that it falls straight down, in the simple straightforward way of the Samian statues. The children are a charming, disruptive, inevitable part of the commo tion of the scene. But the unexpected detail is the statement that anyone looking on might say that these people are "deathless and unaging", because ordinarily those words are epithets re served for the gods. Using them so lightly expresses the wry,</page><page sequence="15">HOWARD BAKER 569 because untrue, and yet smiling confidence of the author of the Hymn in himself and his human species. So too, with a similar imaginative liberty, the philosophers will use these same words later on to say how the basic stuff of the cosmos seems to be. To continue with the Loeb translation: And there is this great wonder besides?and its renown shall never perish?, the girls of Delos, hand-maidens of the Far shooter; for when they have praised Apollo first, and also Leto and Artemis who delights in arrows, they sing a strain telling of men and women of past days, and charm the tribes of men. Also they can imitate the tongues of all men and their clattering speech : each would say that he himself were singing, so close to truth is their sweet song. Here again solemn rite merges into comedy. The girls sing the renown of the gods, then the renown of men, then they sing about the fantastic manners of the different tribes of men: in particular, about their various odd ways of making the sounds which constitute their speech. "Barbarians", the Greeks called remoter strangers, thinking they were naming them after the vocal noises they made. Even Herodotus is impressed, worldly though he is, by the clash of dialects among the lonians of Panionia. We may suppose that the girls of Delos made sport for their audiences by singing nonsense syllables which sounded like the grotesque speech of exotic visitors actually present. It's an entertaining thing to do, as everyone will agree who remem bers Sid Caesar's renditions of German oratory and Japanese and Italian operas. The Hymn ends with a vivid small dialogue. There is a perennial question, the poet reminds the girls of the chorus, which is bound to come up sooner or later when strangers appear: "Who think ye, girls, is the sweetest singer that comes here, and in whom do you most delight?" Then, when that question is put to them, the poet tells them</page><page sequence="16">570 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS to be sure to remember him and to make reply, each and all, with one voice: "He is a blind man, and dwells in rocky Chios: his lays are ever more supreme." The exchange evokes the archaic scene. It is something left behind from an ancient festival which is expressive of the gregar ious, competitive excitement of the day. Its effect, in its clarity and simplicity, is very much like the effect of the perfectly formed little first-prize award jug, found in Athens, with this wavering, not quite grammatical, ancient inscription on its shoul der: "Who of all the dancers gambols best?THIS. . . ." The blind singer from Chios did not overestimate himself. His Delian hymn has had a unique progeny in the minds of poets of later times, and of successive civilizations. Callimachus, in the heyday of culture in Alexandria, took the Delian stuff and blew it up elegantly to twice its size; and in the heyday of elegance in Rome Sextus Propertius invoked Callimachus to be his spon sor in his efforts to translate the Delian dances into Italian revels: an effort which was to be renewed not without brilliant success in the Italian Renaissance. In a small heyday of our own, Ezra Pound revived memories of the pagan celebration in a peculiarly pleasant idiom: Shades of Callimachus, Coan ghosts of Philetas It is in your grove I would wTalk, I who came first from the clear font Bringing the Grecian orgies into Italy, and the dance into Italy. Who hath taught you so subtle a measure, in what hall have you heard it; What foot beat out your time-bar, what water has mellowed your whistles? ?Homage to Sextus Propertius V "Some say that the sanctuary of Hera in Samos was established</page><page sequence="17">HOWARD BAKER 571 by those who sailed in the Argo," writes Pausanias (VII, iv, 4), "and that these brought the image from Argos. But the Samians themselves hold that the goddess was born in the island by the side of the river Imbrasos under the lygos that even in my time grew in the Heraion." Thus, according to ancient authority, in a clash of legends be gins the Samian affair with the gods. According to the modern German scientists who have made the island their particular study, the lygos, or ancient willow, did in fact rank as the primary object of religious excitement among the early inhabitants. The Imbrasos, though only an unimpressive riverbed while it remains in the hills, waters a luxuriant patch of land as it makes its de bouchment into the sea. Here were living springs, beside which grew the great, gentle trees; and it is around the stump of one of these that some of the oldest rockwork has been found?-an encircling basin, a flat pavement, and a crude altar. According to Hans Walter, who has condensed most of what is known?and surmised?about the Heraion in his Das Griechische Heiligtumy the forerunner of Hera was quite apparently a vegetation god dess. She is perhaps to be understood as living earth with all of its growing things taking on immanent form in the lygos tree. Her first image was presumably an unshaped slab of wood, the "rude stock" of old-fashioned parlance, which was dropped from heaven; and the ritual which was associated with her was, in the modern catch-phrase, the "fertility rite". I think that the inadequacy of both the old and the new vo cabulary to deal with the Hera of the lonians must be more or less self-evident. To recite the pedigree of a deity or a ritual, in the manner of the school of Sir James Frazer, is hardly ever to capture the thing as it actually existed. Rather it is often to lose it in the shadows where all divinity and all ways of soliciting divinity are constantly merging together. More to the point per haps is to recognize that pools of water and flowery groves?and the sea itself?created, and still create, the sort of wonder which</page><page sequence="18">572 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS builds monuments, be they rough stone altars or great temples or the multiplication of shrines to the nymphs like those which Strabo discovered on the lowlands at the mouth of the river Al pheus. The goddess Hera is to be discovered, if at all, in many an evasive shimmer rather than in the hard abstraction which would either affirm or deny her descent from the vegetation god dess. Of the two larger festivals of Hera, the first?the marriage with Zeus?speaks for itself. The divine embrace, toward which the ceremonies led, obviously bespoke creation, reproduction, fer tility, the perpetuation of things. It is impossible now to measure the degree of delicate symbolism or gross sensuality which may have crept in and out of this rite; nor are there impeccable stand ards against which to imagine making the measurement; a mar riage feast being what it is, though, the forces that pervade it could hardly have been other than beneficent, mysterious but yet no mystery, as it has been among people always. The second seems as eccentric as the first centric. The Tonea may be translated as the feast of the binding. The principal activity in it was washing and reattiring the cult statue, a cere mony which had its parallels at other places. In Samos the wooden statue was carried to the sea or riverbank, cleansed in ritual fashion and clothed with an elegance which contrasted with the simplicity of the underlying figure, and then restored to its place in the shrine; but in Samos the rite had a particular logic, in that the bath was a preparation for the marriage with Zeus. So in its way it was an opulent variation on the ceremony which normally preceded weddings, like the wedding which Iphigeneia thought awaited her in Aulis, in which there is customary recourse to special springs and streams like the Imbrasos for ceremonial bath waters. The rite in Samos however ended in fantasy. The statue appears to have been tied down with withes from the sacred willow. Once long ago, the historian Menodotos relates, some Tyrrhenian pirates came by in the night and carried off the</page><page sequence="19">HOWARD BAKER 573 image; but when they had taken it into their ship they found themselves unable to make the ship budge. So they placed the statue on the beach and fled. In the morning Hera's attendants, finding their goddess far from the place where she was supposed to be, imagined that she had wandered away, and to prevent such a thing from happening again they bound her onto a mat of lygos withes. The name Tonea, along with the myth that explains it, implies a rite of which the exact significance is in doubt. Granted that a connection between binding a woman and securing her virginity may be slyly suggested; granted that fettering a cult image to its base has its parallels elsewhere?still I think that the virtue of the Samian Tonea must lie strictly in the artistry of the whole ceremony, with the finest flourish, lacing the statue down, re served for the end. My contention, as against Walter's, is that ritual is more likely to imitate art than art ritual. For instance: the goddess on the Ludovisi throne, who is being lifted from the sea by gold-filleted attendants, illustrates the Homeric Hymn of the birth of Aphro dite, I believe, and not a cult bath. It is significant that Pausanias records several works of art depicting this myth, and thousands depicting other myths, but none or few which illustrate ritualistic activities; and on painted vases mythological scenes outnumber ritual scenes by a hundred to one. The distinction is not unim portant. By seeing ritual as most frequently a derivative from narrative art, you preserve Aegean freedom and gaiety; by look ing at it the other way, you exaggerate the formalistic. In this matter I must follow the French school, as led by Jean Charbon neaux, rather than its rivals. The lygos persisted, in any event, through all of the stages of worship on the banks of the Imbrasos. The tree and the archaic goddess, on coins which were struck in the ripe years of the Roman Empire, still compose the badge which was most appropri ate to Samos. A number of brass pieces in the British Museum 5</page><page sequence="20">574 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS which depict the ancient statue show her standing erect, elabor ately costumed, in the entrance of a tiny temple. To one side in front, on one coin, stands a pot containing the tree; it is small, of course, but unmistakable in its symbolism. Coins witness other traditional accouterments of Hera, such as her peacocks. On several Imperial coins a pair of these birds stretch their heads up dramatically under the statue's lifted arms. On early silver coins from Samos Homer's ox-eyed queen of heaven seems to be remembered in the representation of the head and forequarters of a handsome bovine of indistinct gender. But the most common design on the earliest coinage is the likeness of a lion's face. It is a mask really, a face-on view of a lion's head. The connection with Hera seems, according to Callimachus, to be this: the statue was presented to the spectator with a lion's skin spread out at its feet, apparently to dramatize Hera's invincible powers. Moreover the discovery recently of a small marble tripod of the kind called a perirrhanterion, in which lions lie prostrate, under leash, beneath the feet of three goddess-like women, suggests that notions of a kinship between Hera and the old Mistress of Animals reverberated for a long time through Greek minds. Other temple decorations emphasize the pattern of oriental as sociations. There were, for instance, a fiercely stylized lion's head cast in bronze, with a complacent frog sitting on it, serving somewhere in the precincts as a fountain spout; Eastern monsters like the griffin affixed to kettles; bare-bosomed Astarte figurines; the ox-head, the frog, the pomegranate, the lion-head?rimming the shallow pottery offering-vessel called the kernos. Goddesses, it appears, can be fickle in their choice of attributes and com panions; and this one, once she got over her limitations as a vegetation goddess, showed a decided taste for the orientalizing trends of the times of her greatest triumphs. Lion skin or no, she remained extravagantly feminine. In the Imperial coins she is dressed to the teeth as befits a goddess who</page><page sequence="21">HOWARD BAKER 575 is preparing to become a bride. She wears an enormous mantle with large pleats running across her breast. Below this garment is another with a broad crisscross design. From her partly raised arms cumbersome hangings drop to the ground. These may represent or may conceal the lacings of lygos withes which tie her to her base; the hangings at all events seem to fix the image in its position just as the rods or fillets held by the many-breasted Ephesian Artemis fix her in hers. On her head Hera, also in the Eastern fashion, wears a tall miter that becomes broader as it goes up and is elegantly horned. Probably her trappings were brightly colored. From somewhere in the midst of them she seems to be looking out, full-featured and pensive, Dedalic in character, slightly Asiatic, like the Lady of Auxerre in the Louvre. The goddess, so arrayed, is the creation for the most part, I would guess, of her vivacious attendants, whose assignment it was to make festival of her bath and toilet. Maybe that's the way it is with gods and goddesses. They start out as rude stocks and stones, magical, omnipotent, but formless, and they remain that way until they are taken up in the human imagination and cared for. Then they become glorious. VI It is said that an early civilization to which the Greeks harked back in important ways, that of Mesopotamia, produced but few statues of note, practically no free-standing images of human beings which are wholly enjoyable. Animals, yes; animals that are fanciful and lovely; some engagingly humanized scenes de picted in friezes; but no real statuary. The reasons for this, it is said (my principal authority is Henri Frankfort), are first that there was a dearth of stone suitable for sculpture and second that copies of the human being, when they were made, were regarded as solidifications of the divine, and, as such, they were to be treated as temple furniture. What statues there were represented</page><page sequence="22">576 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS heaven-gazing priests or semi-divinities in the main. Since the populace was excluded from the temples they were seen only by priests, and of the priests only by those of highest rank. Each inner sanctum where a statue might be relegated was more and more remote from the world of sunlight and shadow, embedded deeper and deeper in temple conventions. In these circumstances the art of translating human form into stone naturally dried up. With the Greeks it was the opposite. They had stone? they made statues, and they set them up for the widest possible view. They kept their temples open. But even so, they made a practice of bringing the cult image out into the plaza for ceremonial oc casions. Their art thrived in the daylight, against the background of landscape and seascape with architectural accents. It was con sequently a monumental art. In these scenes anything less than the monumental?the naturalistic, for instance?would have been out of place. It had to create human figures which would match the sky and the sea. Therefore it could never quite forget the pure elemental stone in its shapes, and it brightened the shapes with color. Of course, in Asia, with the passing of time, Mesopotamian constrictions began to relax. In the lands of the old Hittite kingdom, among the Assyrians and the Phoenicians, smiths and sculptors began producing a humanized, highly available art which the Greeks envied, imported lavishly into places like Samos, imitated, and improved on. Nevertheless the basic black and-white differences between East and West remained pretty much what they had been. When Babylon becomes, as it does, the counterpart of archaic Samos?Darius subdued both centers in quick succession at the beginning of his reign?the contrast still hinges on opposing religious presuppositions, and the contrast is extreme. The Greeks had no official theology and no hierarchy of priests; the Babylonians were hagridden by both. Simplistic though this assertion may sound, it will stand up for all practical</page><page sequence="23">HOWARD BAKER 577 purposes. The pantheon of the Greek gods was as unsystematic and naive as Homer and Hesiod had happened to make it; which was so loose a structure that a variety of cults?Demeter's at Eleusis would be but one instance?could go charging off along their separate ways without committing anyone, not even a par ticipant in the rites, to a particular creed. Similarly the oracles. The oracle of Apollo at Delphi, the oracle of Apollo at Bran chidae, were local extrusions. Their success rested on a carefully nurtured prestige, which was political and social in scope, and hardly significant in religious ways. Samos, though rich in temples, seems never to have let any of them put a noticeable imprint on its public life; but Babylon on the other hand was so overawed by its Ziggurat that it sanctioned a great annual New Year's ceremony in which Marduk's priest divested the king of all royal authority and subjected him to humiliating rites before restoring his divine but temporary man date to him. The dethroning of course seems to symbolize the submission of king to priesthood as effectively as to Marduk. In contrast with the cheerful Tonea in Samos, the Babylonian New Year's festival was accompanied by a sorrowing ritual of expia tion; and this in turn was supported by a liturgy of penitence which was read through the year, and by various extensive ser vices to exorcise demons and bring about magical escapes from misfortune. In order to confront a universe so riddled by the ominous, the Babylonians developed one of the most ambitious disciplines in history, the pseudo-science of divination. But here again a priestly order was in charge, and the ritualistic, conventional methods of forecasting the future were mixed up thoroughly with methods that demanded at least a basic exercise of the intelligence. Divina tion by the study of the entrails of a sacrificed animal, which they favored most, is, I think, an irrational discipline; while astrology, which they favored next, is rational, but because of its official perversity failed to be of much value as an introduction to astron</page><page sequence="24">578 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS omy: there was nothing in it to foreshadow an Aristarchus. Both techniques of reading the future?and still others?flourished through centuries and centuries of careful nurturing and trans mission. Diodorus Siculus considered the education of a Babylon ian diviner to be superior to the training which could be obtained in any of the Greek schools. And in its oblique way it probably was. The Greeks were aware of these Babylonian arts and were mildly addicted here and there to the practice of them. They examined the intestines of their sacrifices for the purposes of divination when the occasion ahead of them seemed to be desper ate. They reacted, often disastrously, to the peculiarities of the heavens, they were affected by dreams, they found omens even in trivial things, like a pun embedded in a stranger's name. Mostly, though, they did not concern themselves deeply with divination; it looks as if they may have gone through the motions of using it sometimes, as before the battle of Plataea, as a means of controlling the morale of the army. Nevertheless, as the war with Persia came painfully to the long-awaited showdown, Her odotus seems to find the Greeks increasingly concerned with reading omens in their sacrifices. Curiously (perhaps), it was usually the virile Spartans, and not the softer Ionians, who re sorted to the artful science. One Greek diviner, a man named De?phonos, could stand for many, and for their repute among intelligent Greeks. The fol lowing is the treatment which this particular seer gets from Her odotus. Just before the great, decisive victory over the Persian land and naval forces at Mycale, the Greek fleet had stayed their depar ture from Delos until De?phonos, the diviner whom the Spartan command had brought down with the ships, could assure them of a favorable augury. This accomplished, the fleet set sail and made a rendezvous near the temple of Hera off Samos. Finding that the Persian navy had fled from the island,</page><page sequence="25">HOWARD BAKER 579 the Greeks pursued; they rounded Mycale; and with battle-cries of "Hebe!" (if they were thinking of the child of Hera and Zeus, perhaps remembering the Samian marriage festival), or of "Hera!" (if our text needs mending), they fell on their enemies, who had beached their boats and fortified themselves as best they could, and vied mightily with one another in destroying them. But Herodotus had interrupted his narrative at the beginning of this episode to tell about the diviner De?phonos (IX, 93-95). What he tells and his manner of telling it are typically Ionian, witty, wayward, vivacious, elusive. The bulk of it is a sparkling digression having to do with the diviner's father, Evenius, also a diviner, whose marvelous adventures must lie somewhat outside the province of ordinary history. It seems that back sometime in the past, this man, having been assigned guard duty over a flock of sacred sheep which his town was responsible for, fell asleep and allowed the wolves to get into the flock. As a punish ment, his fellow townsmen blinded him. But the gods came to his aid, and eventually they made him a sort of back-country Tiresias by awarding him the gift of prophecy. So much at a little length Herodotus tells us about the father; but this and only this about the son: "I have heard it said that De?phonos was no son of Evenius, but only traded on his name, and worked for whatever he could get out of it, up and down Hellas." With this disdainful remark he abruptly dismisses the diviner and the divination and proceeds to his own sweeping ac count of the victory at Mycale. Though in Babylon to the east and Etruria to the west divina tion commanded rapt attention, it certainly was not important in Ionia. Semonides, the poet who led a Samian colony to Amorgas, appears in a fragment of his to pride himself on his knowledge of ritual and his skill in handling the sacrifice of an animal:</page><page sequence="26">580 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS The boar, how I roasted him! How I cut him up in priestly fashion! I'm not bad at my craft! The context for this, however, is feasting, gourmet cooking, high living. Semonides was a bon-vivant, a satirist, and quite clearly a scoffer at divination. But of course the furious religiosity of the peoples on the Greek horizons, both east and west, goes back to the deepest of issues?the problem of man's frail mortality. The Asiatics like the Etruscans seem to have brooded constantly on death, alter nately loathing it and contesting against it, as in the story of Gilgamesh, or building artificial paradises in which to enjoy it, as in the opulent Royal Cemetery of Ur or the gaudy tombs of Etruria. Either way the emphasis falls on the supernatural and the possibility of wringing from the gods a few drops of their immortal power. With the Greeks, as we have already said, that the end is death goes without saying. Death is dismal, as dismal as Achilles reveals it to be in the underworld scene in the Odyssey. But nothing can be done to undo it, and it is madness to make it a constant topic of thought. The question is whether, from any point of view, the undeluded and unimpassioned accept ances of the Greeks and their vital enjoyments in their gods and their temples and their myths, and their world, do not add up to just about all that can be expected, consciously and rationally, of any faith. VII In the worship of Hera the dancing that the lygos and the fresh fountains attracted was most likely at first a vigorous out doors pleasure, like Maydays among northern people. Then came the refinements. These can be read as accurately, I believe, in the housing that was built for Hera as in the scanty evidence of the evolution of the cult-image and the cult itself. The first astonishing innovation was the "hundred-footer" temple of the early eighth century, already alluded to. It was a</page><page sequence="27">HOWARD BAKER 581 tall tunnel-like building, some 108 feet long, if we use our notion of a foot, and twenty-one feet wide. Although open-ended and open-gabled toward the plaza and the big altar to the east, the walls were otherwise a continuous band of sun-dried bricks rest ing on stone foundations. The roof, which was steep and thatched, found support for its ridge-pole on a row of fourteen centrally located wooden posts. Obviously the problem of interior light ing, which was troublesome anyway in archaic buildings, is es pecially acute in this strangely elongated one. Of course there could have been an opening in the roof, in accordance with a primitive stratagem which culminated in the Pantheon in Rome. If hole there were, even a narrow one, the bright Mediterranean sky would have worked wonders. In any event, the cult statue had a base of its own in the open plaza which it occupied in times of ceremony. The want of openness in the first building is acknowledged in the design of the second. When a flood in the middle of the seventh century wrecked the old building, the plan for rebuilding it on practically the same foundations called for the elimination of the array of central posts. But this entailed emphasizing even further the elongated interior. The width of the area to be spanned was cut down to eighteen feet, while the length was not much less than it had been before. Samian architects from the beginning, whatever their problems with lighting or with timber ing a superstructure, insisted on using wonder-provoking di mensions, which are religious in tone. In this case it was the vista that was to be had, with the aid of skylight or of lamps, down through a brilliantly decorated interior. To offset this artfulness, the builders began very early to stretch wide, completely open, post-supported porticoes around the exterior?creating the pat tern for the formal colonnade. At the same time they erected open and yet weather-sheltering arcades near the temple, where the business of the precinct could be carried on. When the giant temple suddenly succeeded these skinny</page><page sequence="28">582 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS hundred-footers, it seemed all at once to preserve their strangely impressive effect and to solve their problems. The old peculiarly long perspective is recapitulated in the enormous alleys and cross alleys among the columns, inside and out, in the new architecture. So deceptive were distances and directions in the sight-lines among the rows of columns that the first of the large buildings became known as the Labyrinth: such at least is the name that Pliny applied to it. The illusion of complex spaces was intensi fied too by the soaring heights of all members, the columns rising probably to forty or more feet. Good lighting went along with such heights, at least in the foreparts of the building, and would have persisted elsewhere as long as roofing the whole structure over remained unaccomplished?whatever the designers' original intentions may have been. The first colossal limestone-columned temple was the creation of the Samian artist-engineer Theodoros and the pioneer archi tect Rhoikos. They began work in about 570 B. C. by moving the channel of the Imbrasos to the west in order to give them selves room for the foundations of the building they had in mind, which was to be 350 by 175 feet, approximately. Thus the pro ject called for erecting an airy-appearing structure of incalculable weight on a water-soaked, treacherous terrain. And this in fact was its marvel. A further marvel was the speed with which it was built. It had arrived at least at the point of having some of its roof tiles in place when it was destroyed by fire in c. 540, possibly in the first of the forays of the Persians against the Greeks (cf. Pausanias VII, v, 4). Immediately there began to spring up a similar, even larger structure to take its place. This is the famous temple of the age of Polycrates, which Herodotus names as one of the three most wondrous works of his times. From its ruins it is that the single marble column arises like a white finger, visible today, as it has been for centuries, from miles around. The second Labyrinth tempts everyone to emphasize its big</page><page sequence="29">HOWARD BAKER 583 ness. It was big: sixteen feet longer than its predecessor and four or five feet wider. It did have many?133 by one count? towering columns. It did invite comparison with the Artemisium of Ephesus. But statistics are delusive, and the aim of the build ers could hardly have been to attain a superiority measurable by mere physical size. Their aim must have been first of all to build a temple which would fit the festivals. With the coming of the first great temple and with it an enormously enlarged altar, the space between struc tures was much reduced; the dancing plaza was dwarfed and the festival cramped. The new temple was pushed back to the west another 130 feet. The Imbrasos had to be moved again, but a place for dancing was recovered. The scene returned to what it originally had been: open, but surrounded by a scattering of monuments and secondary temples, many more of these now than formerly. To this whole scene the temple of Hera itself must remain subordinate, and its dimensions relatively insignificant. That most desirable of effects, openness, was the striking fea ture of the second Labyrinth. The main room, or celia in the usual structure, remained an unroofed court. This may not have been altogether intentional; time and materials may not have sufficed to get it covered over; a decision to roof or not to roof may never have been really faced up to. Openness, and open endedness, is characteristic of the Ionian mind and Ionic works. Though the account by Herodotus of the great temple of Hera has given it its special renown, it was still incomplete in his day. Until Hellenistic times work on it speeded up and slowed down as conditions dictated; but efforts may have gone more willingly into improvements, such as rafting fine marble down the coast and replacing a limestone column with a much better one, than in trying to get the job finished up. At almost any time one segment or another of the vast temple would have consisted in no more than a row of columns, without entablature or roof. It was never finished. That is the way it was, the way it had</page><page sequence="30">584 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS to be. The originators of the design, Theodoros and Rhoikos, and their successors, were striving for a note which they and all Ionians knew was out of reach. Their plan was the expression of a peculiar aspiration which might be called religious. The Ionic temple was a fabric which could never be rounded off and called done. And so you will find Dorian temples on stony promontories; heavy, complete, absolute constructions; some of them, particu larly in Italy, still nearly intact. But the Ionian vision was of an ever-changing cluster of ornate, slender white shafts, patched here and there with color, standing on well-watered lowlands bordering the sea and reflecting its restlessness. Second Part VIII Openness and mobility: the Heraion of Samos composed a landscape which could not have been otherwise than vivacious. The cult image of Hera was brought forth from its abode on holidays, as we have said, and became the center of the fair. Apollo and Artemis, Hermes and Aphrodite, with temples of their own, instigated further celebrations: we can read about the origin of one nocturnal festival, not in ancient ritual but in a par ticular recent emergency, in which Samian youths and maidens had danced, with sesame cakes in their hands, in and out of the temple of Artemis, feeding a consignment of boy prisoners who had escaped from a Corinthian ship and taken sanctuary there (Her. Ill, 48). The flow of human traffic on ordinary days is indicated by the remains of paved avenues that linked the temples together, winding among monuments, leading to buildings which housed works of art of incredible variety. In fact the scene taken as a whole, indoors and out, was a series of galleries, in some of which a cult image was the incidental axis for the flow of visitors.</page><page sequence="31">HOWARD BAKER 585 Whatever the lygos branch meant to them, or the sesame cake, or the image of the god itself, these were people who in the full ness of archaic times were moved to one clear sentiment: "First fruits are best, and they belong to the gods." As evidence of the power of this persuasion we can cite a broad range of first-fruit offerings in the form of objects dedicated to a deity and in scribed?or otherwise accounted for in the earliest records?in such a way as to make the transaction unmistakable. To begin with, first-fruit gifts must have been simple things like the first gatherings of a harvest baked into cakes and eaten ceremonially; in such rites vegetation magic connives easily enough with the gregarious feelings that arise when crops are ready to be taken in, a new year is beginning, and the harvest star, Sirius, has reappeared low in the morning sky, bringing heat with it. In time, however, the magical and propitiating manoeu vre drops out of sight, and the occasion for thank-offerings is no longer confined to the round of seasonal events. Rather, it becomes a rule that one should set aside the first of any abun dance, great or small, and tithe it back, in the form of a temple gift, as an expression of gratitude. Most conspicuous of the temple gifts of the sixth century were the life-size or far over life-size statues of naked young men, the kouroi, standing with their tall straight-forward bodies and elaborately dressed hair, here and there, even on the rim of the roof of the great temple of Rhoikos and Theodoros. And along with the youths, the maidens, the korai, with their long shimmer ing festival chitons and short mantles and meticulously shaped braids; and with them, more regal female figures, the counter parts of the colossal young men, such as the Hera of the Louvre, Cheramyes' dedication, who represents not Hera herself but a noble bearer of a gift to the goddess. Although none of these statues has come down through the centuries intact, enough has been left to show not only what they looked like but what they had seen fit in their time to say for</page><page sequence="32">586 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS themselves. They bear short, clear-cut inscriptions quite regu larly. Often on the front seam of the chiton, on the leg of the kouros, or on the base on which he stands, there is incised a hex ameter line which names the donor, whom we may call "X" for the moment, and continues in Homeric language something like this: " 'X' to Hera dedicates from his gains a gift most beauti ful." The formula is followed not in Ionia alone but throughout Greece with but little variation, although the language is twisted around and around, and sometimes elaborated, while staying within the limits of epigrammatic expression. A second dedica tion by Cheramyes, a Samian statue now in Berlin, bears a typi cal hexameter on the edge of the chiton: iCCheramyes my ane theke thei ferikalles agalma" (Cheramyes dedicated me to the goddess, a most beautiful statue-gift). Other inscriptions men tion the first-fruits or tenth-parts of windfalls of some kind, un expected rewards of booty taken in battle, as being the source that financed the dedication. At their best the verses are pristine examples of archaic written language impressing form and order on amorphous religious premises, and likewise, we may presume, on the imaginative intentions of the artist working with the plastic materials. In either case the objective is the creation and the dedication of a thing which is beautiful in terms of the Homeric canon of beauty. The epithet "a most beautiful gift"?ferikalles agalma?in Homer's text is a climactic phrase used to express a peculiarly Greek appreciation of fine workmanship. In the Odyssey (XVIII, 290-300) Penelope's wooers are presenting her at last with their formal gifts. The first gift is a magnificent robe, richly em broidered and fitted with golden brooches; the second is a chain, "cunningly wrought" and strung with beads as bright as the sun; the third is a pair of comparably wonderful earrings. Noble gifts, these; but the final one is a necklace with a jewel: this is a superb, a most splendid f erikalles agalma. This is the excel lence to which the temple dedications aspire. Whether they occur</page><page sequence="33">HOWARD BAKER 587 in marble or ivory or wood, or clay or bronze or gold, each was as laudable for the work of the skilled hand of the maker, who often identifies himself, as for the intrinsic value of the material. Ivory, after all, in the tycs of the archaic age, could be decorated advantageously with glass; marble with metal, copper or gold. While many dedicatory gifts were too little or too simple to carry an inscription, those that are inscribed speak for the others, and we can be sure that all were fashioned with epic care and put on display with lyrical composure. A piece of the rim of a very old pottery kettle from the Heraion preserves the ending of an elegiac distich: ". . . in return for great kindness". The words bespeak the gracious manner of Anacreon and the old Ionian elegy. In some other instances, in spite of difficulties, the in scription is present, full force. A very ancient small bronze kouros, possibly from Thebes, manages to recite its message, even though getting it spelled out meant lacerating both legs with a network of letters: "Mantiklos dedicated me to the Far-darter of the silver bow as part of his tithe; do thou, Phoebus, grant him a kind return." So much language from so unpretentious and bluntly earnest a little man! Though Ionian suavity may be wanting here, the effect of the whole is still Homeric, including the ingenuous prayer for worthy requital. The overloaded figure illustrates the way in which the Greeks fused their arts together; the verses are part and parcel with the statue and there is no reason why they shouldn't be its predominant feature. An inseparability among the kinds of human expression was a practical fact in ar chaic times. It was not an age of specializations. IX You can read a brief history of ancient Samos, with its many sided activities and purposes and spiritual values, in the variety of its temple dedications. Behind each of the more impressive dedicatory objects there lay a story which was handed down as</page><page sequence="34">588 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS a temple tradition and related by official narrators to temple visitors. Herodotus makes us fully aware of the richness of the oral history that could be sopped up within the precincts of sanctu aries like the Heraion. In fact we can see pretty clearly that he began the investigations which were to become his life-work, in the Heraion, soon after he migrated to Samos as a young man. History became for him, as it turned out, partly the narrative of what had to be said to explain the monuments and the legends left behind from the fighting with the Persians, and partly the theistic and artistic constructions that were necessary to interpret them. As for Samos, one of the most meaningful events in its earlier history was the voyage which the ship of a sea-captain named Kolaios made when bad winds carried him through the Straits of Gibraltar to the Atlantic port of Tartessos, a then unexploited place that controlled rich mines. Kolaios and his shipmates brought a fortune in metals back to Samos. This occurred in the late seventh or early sixth century; it was the first chapter in the history of Samian sea power. The voyage nevertheless could have become a faded legend; it remained a vivid, precise recollection because Kolaios put a tenth part of the ship's profits into a monu mental dedication which testified to the greatness of the achieve ment. He had a bronze Argolic krater made, an enormous bowl decorated with griffins' heads around the rim, and he set it up in the temple of Hera, using a tripod of three kneeling figures of bronze, each eleven feet high, to support it. This huge thing survived several temples of Hera. It challenged the imagina tions of all comers, Herodotus among them. It aptly signified a shifting of horizons in the Ionian world. A wine bowl of similar proportions, which found its way into the Heraion by devious means, signified not so much the heroic as the riddling aspects of history. This is one that had been de signed as a gift for Croesus. The Spartans, having concluded an alliance with the grand Lydian monarch, made a huge bronze</page><page sequence="35">HOWARD BAKER 589 mixing krater which they calculated to be worthy of his magnifi cence. While they were shipping it to him by boat, the overthrow of both the man and his splendid city took place. At this juncture either the Samians intercepted the ship which was carrying the bowl and seized it, or the Spartan sailors contrived to sell it to them and then claimed that they had been robbed of it. What ever the truth, the Samians got the bowl and dedicated it to Hera. Herodotus examined it, heard the story about it, and described it in improbable terms. Only the discovery of the huge volute krater in Vix in France in 1953 makes his account of the container with its frieze of figures around the top fairly credible. So spectacular an ornament, extracted by obscure means from the dust cloud that accompanied the downfall of Sardis and Croesus, encouraged an Ionic mood of restiveness when confronted by examples of gross oriental prosperity: the gods are easily made jealous, mortal men are prone to hubris. As their sea power increased, the Samians certainly did be come high-handed in their treatment of other people's shipping. A dedication by Aiakes attests to this fact. It is probably an in evitable sequence: from power to the misuse of power. But the inscription on the dedication reveals the aplomb, the piety even, with which practices strongly resembling piracy could be accepted. The object in question is a beautiful though headless marble statue of an over life-size, seated figure, a regal womanly figure, clothed sumptuously, the feet resting on an upholstered stool, the arms lying forward in the lap beside small lions on the throne arms?the master archaeologist Ernst Buschor believed that it represented Hera, the goddess herself. On the side of the throne are inscribed words to this effect: "Dedicated by Aiakes son of Bryson, who swelled the takings for Hera during his directorship." The sentence may mean that Aiakes, the his torical "tyrant"-director of Samos, imposed tolls on passing ship ping in a more or less customary manner, or it may mean that he plundered whoever and whatever came within his reach ; it prob 6</page><page sequence="36">590 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS ably means something in between, a little of both, depending on the circumstances. In any event this Aiakes was doubtless the father of Polycrates and Polycrates was known by his rivals in the Aegean as a pirate. Buschor may be right: a magnificent en throned Hera would be as appropriate to Samos (the Thalassoc racy) as the wooden vegetation goddess was to the modest well watered area around the lygos tree. Gods and goddesses tend, as Xenophanes said, to be of one and the same corpulence and one and the same complexion with their worshippers. Archaic Hera sponsored no oracles and had no political in fluence to trade for gifts; the history of her treasures therefore reflects Ionian detachment. True, Amasis of Egypt, in his troubled search for allies against Persian aggression, did woo Samian Hera with "two wooden statues of himself", which Herodotus says stood yet in his day behind the doors in the great shrine. The shrine also possessed a linen breastplate that came from Amasis, which was so wonderfully woven and embroidered that admiring sightseers are reported to have picked it nearly to pieces; but the breastplate was another of the trophies which the Samians had seized from the Spartans. Most of Amasis's gifts to Samos went where they would presumably do the most good? directly to the palace of Polycrates; even here, as matters turned out, they met with Ionian detachment and bought Amasis abso lutely nothing. Eventually his elegant small gifts became part of the temple collections: not a few returned to light during the excavations. On the whole the treasures of the Heraion are reflections of the worldliness of the people supporting the cult. Worldliness, though, is a complicated matter. It relishes small splendors, like the molded and engraved mirrors which came originally from Amasis. It enjoys a wayward myth, as is illustrated in the small bronze casting of a jubilant eagle, which is Zeus, carrying off Ganymede. It steps outside itself in its curiosity about other parts of the world and in its awareness of the transitoriness of things.</page><page sequence="37">HOWARD BAKER 591 It is not self-preoccupied. That mainly is its difference from otherworldliness. A memento mori is a private and personal possession in a way that no temple gift ever was. The one is an inward symbol, the other looks outward. The gaunt Biblical figures flanking the doorways of the cathedral in Chartres face us with identical devout, abstracted gazes. Detail by detail they differ from one another in many small ways, but yet they merge together; they form one architectural shadow, full of repeated forms, all expressing the same uncomplicated distant mood, which is easy to grasp. The Greeks separated their figures. They made surfaces and textures for the light to play on. They attended to the contours of the body and took account of the landscape around it. Their work shimmers in the atmosphere of this world and, strange though it may sound to say it, it is not easy to grasp. X Underlying the simplicity of the sense of gratitude which originally expressed itself in the tithing of first-fruits are some darkish and fairly evasive threads of meaning. Extra-rational recognitions seem to be involved. First-fruits are special fruits, more noticeable than any that are to follow, and more unaccount able, like the earliest figs swelling among the unopened leaves; like youth, like springtime. That, or some portion of that joyous unstable thing, is what belongs to the gods. And therein lies a trouble. The better and the more wonderful the thing that comes one's way, the more insecure one must be in the possession of it. That, or something of the sort, is the secret of the genius of the archaic age and of its finest works, the kouroi and the korai. Both types of youth-statues, it will be remembered, were favored as monuments in graveyards and in the gay temples of the gods. The inference must be that youth itself in its pristine form be longs to the lords who rule over life and death. The absolutely naked and defenseless young man, standing straight, carefully combed; or the delicate chiton-trailing maiden?these are ap</page><page sequence="38">592 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS propriate images for the human being in extremis, whether of good fortune or evil. There has been found a statue base, clearly the support at one time for a large marble kouros, which is inscribed as follows: "Stand and weep by the tomb of Croesus dead, whom rushing Ares destroyed one day as he fought in the forefront." Miss Gisela Richter sees a likely connection of this base and epitaph with the suave, Eastern-looking kouros from Anavysos: the Lydian name Croesus suggests an East-Greek origin of the young man being remembered. But no matter exactly who he may have been, the juxtaposition of the upstanding naked fighter contend ing unequally with a furious god of war is eloquent beyond analy sis. The War-god changes his style with the passing of time; but the plight of the young soldier remains forever the same. At Delphi in May of 1893 a party of excavators digging through a bank toward an ancient retaining wall swept away a curtain of earth from in front of an archaic marble kouros, so that all of a sudden they met a survivor from a very distant age face to face. The effect was shocking, as the documentary photo graphs show. The white marble figure is so compact, so intensely forward-looking, eager, nude, that he makes his discoverers, standing around wonder-struck in their dark formless clothes, look like phantoms. The following spring a second, almost identical kouros turned up nearby. Inscriptions on the base blocks indicated that the pair of statues had stood one near the other on a common footing and were the work of Polymedes of Argos. They represented Kleobis and Biton, brothers, who were honored, the inscription revealed, "because they drew their mother for forty-five furlongs, put ting themselves to the yoke". The full story of this dazzling act of filial devotion figures among the preliminaries which Herodotus attaches to his Histories. In Book I, Chapter 31, Solon, having arrived in Sardis, recounts the legend of the two youths for Croesus's benefit, proffering it to the rich Lydian</page><page sequence="39">HOWARD BAKER 593 monarch as an antidote against his self-infatuation as a supremely prosperous man. But antidotes can be evil-tasting medicines. The parable ruffled Croesus's feelings, as it has ruffled the sensi tivities of a great many readers ever since. The problem for Croesus and Solon was to decide what the greatest possible happiness consists in. A good answer will be found, Solon asserts, in the example of Kleobis and Biton. To begin with, they were fine young men, honorable, rich, and champions in the games. Then one day, when there was to be the great festival of Hera at Argos, the oxen that were accus tomed to draw their mother's wagon to the temple failed to ar rive from the fields. In the emergency the two athletes put their own necks to the yoke and dragged the cart with their mother in it the forty-five furlongs to the temple steps. In the crowd, the men, beholding this, praised the youths for their strength, while the women praised the mother for having such sons; and she in her elation went straight to the statue of the goddess and prayed that her boys might be granted the best of the blessings which it is possible for mortals to receive. The prayer was answered. That night, in the temple, Kleobis and Biton died in their sleep : they nevermore would suffer evils, no disasters of fortune, no illnesses, no old age. The mother was properly rewarded, and rebuked. "Then the Argives," the passage ends, "made and set up at Delphi images of them because of their excellence." They were there for Herodotus to consider when his investigations led him to Delphi ; and one of them it was who, after being underground for centuries, suddenly confronted the modern world on a spring day in 1893. In spite of the peculiar dynamics of oral history and of archaic sculpture, the legend and the statues have both been disconcert ing to normal human complacency, ancient and modern. The legend is stylish and nonrepresentative of the most popular sorts of fiction; the statues are severely stylized and nonrepresenta</page><page sequence="40">594 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS tional of common notions concerning the bodily makeup of young men. In imagery and story-telling they show flagrant disregard for the perfections of nature and the benefactions of divine provi dence. "Oh! Croesus," Solon observes, ". . . the power above us is full of jealousy, and fond of troubling our lot." Wry dia logue like that offends the devout. Among ancients, Plutarch reprehended Herodotus for this passage, common though the ironical, pessimistic sentiment is in early literature. Among mod erns, George Rawlinson, gifted translator and churchman, offered to excuse it as a product of Herodotus's "cheerful, childlike , . . mediocrity". Like the problem of the living statue and the phan tom spectators, mediocrity of mind is now much more apparent in the commentary than in the passage commented on. All thoughts which we are capable of entertaining about providence and death, I suppose, must be ultimately mediocre; but these ancient flashes coming from the dark sky which Herodotus knew so well may be the least to be despised. These flashes are not to be taken quite literally either. After all, a debate on the question "what the greatest possible happiness consists in" can hardly be expected to rise above sophistry. At tempts at such major definitions elude language and the structures of language; and whatever epigrammatic thrusts they produce must be more or less of the nature of the quips that brightened the banqueting halls of the Seven Sages. Nevertheless Herodotus in these probing stabs departs dra matically from the polytheistic system. In the Kleobis and Biton story the power which blessed the youths with death was the god, the theos (in his wording), impersonal in its being, and not Hera, the kindly goddess of the festival, to whom the prayer was ad dressed. This abstract superior power is not a neat monotheistic something; it is not in the least anthropomorphic; it is simply the way of the universe, the way of a structure so strong and so contrary to the minuscule purposes of man that the disproportion, in Ionian minds, becomes a vast irony. The god, in this sense, is</page><page sequence="41">HOWARD BAKER 595 questioned by Herodotus, as by the whole Homeric tradition, not systematically, but with wit, with real pain, and with a light heartedness no less real, human circumstances being what they are. And the Homeric tradition had the peculiarity of embracing all Greeks in an easy and quite harmonious spiritual confedera tion. Whatever else, they had had Prometheus on their side. And so in Argos, though Kleobis and Biton did not awake, the festival went on. Meanwhile the festivals go on in all of the other places, yesterday and today and tomorrow, in parish churches and great cathedrals, with only the most meager ques tioning of the ways of the universe. As for Samos, in archaic times the silent kouroi and korai were everywhere about, looking out from the tombs at the bright processions, and down on the loud dancing from the heights of the unfinished temple. XI There is also a fabulous picture of the Ionic mind which, if it is not too delicate a tapestry to handle, just might prove to be curiously informative. Ancient mythology having designated Ion, son of Apollo and Creusa, as the founder of the Ionian race, Euripides seized on the myth fairly late in his career and con verted it into the fantastic scenario which he called Ion. The play centers on the discovery, the identification, "the coming forth", of the youth who, through his offspring, would establish the Greek nation on the shores of Asia. In this young man's peculiarities can be detected, I am venturing to say, some of the peculiarities of his descendants, the Ionians. The mixture of stormy drama and cheerful poetry in which Ion finds himself caught up will become the style of the realm he will found, Ionia. All of this, I should add, is as it appears to me to be if we look at the action from Euripides' point of view. As a poet Euripides had been from the beginning notoriously pro-Ionian. Tradition makes him the student of Anaxagoras, who had come to Athens bringing Ionian philosophy with him.</page><page sequence="42">596 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS Be the detail of the connection as it may, Euripides' first extant dramas are ordered by an extreme subjectivism in his tragic per sons which is a sinister variant on the Ionian's chief premise: the all-forming mind, or Nous. Medea's private reasoning and her cruel pursuit of her compulsive ideas take place in a mind which resembles Anaxagoras's Nous falling afoul of itself. The cosmos for her is finally and absolutely only as she sees it. She says: Of all creatures that live and have a soul We women are most unfortunate. 231-32 And unfortunate indeed is the woman, or the man, who feels himself victimized so much, and cannot find a way to get beyond the obsessive force of his particular nature. Medea and Phaedra and Hippolytus are destroyed not by the mere tragic flaw of the Aristotelean canon but by the whole complexion of their beings. Which is much more like Herodotus than Sophocles. The pur poses of the gods again stand in doubt. Then midway in his career Euripides began pitting pure in telligence against the passionate mind, such as Medea's, as the orderer of life. In so doing he was obviously fetching back toward the fountainhead of Ionian science. In a memorable, in deed unforgettable, passage he makes Hecuba in the Trojan Women postulate a new conception of a divine superior power: now the god is in and of the physical cosmos, in and of nature and man's intelligence (884-88): "You who uphold the earth, whose throne is earth, whoever you are, though far away, beyond our ever finding out,?Zeus,?whether law of nature or man's intelligence, to you I pray: walking noiselessly you lead our destinies to just ends." The god, if discernible, is to be discerned intellectually. He is the object of the same sort of inquiry at which the Ionian thinkers had been laboring. The new emphasis on the dispassionate scientific mind leads</page><page sequence="43">HOWARD BAKER 597 Euripides into denunciations of warfare and its ghastly stultifica tions, which must be interpreted in part as hopeful missionary work seeking to put an end to the ruinous contest between Athens and Sparta, the long-drawn-out, utterly enervating Peloponnesian War. In the Suppliant Women, for instance, the Argive king Adrastus, having allowed himself to be led into a disastrous war by all sorts of blindly passionate coercions, finds himself having to face up to the scrutinizing mind of Theseus and hear himself criticized with cold objectivity. Adrastus, abject in his defeat, can make no defense of his war nor of himself. When he should have been skeptical, pragmatic, and restrained, he had been naive, superstitious, and impetuous. He has earned the scorn which Theseus lays upon him. But he is a suppliant. The women with him, widows and mothers, the victims of his pigheadedness, are suppliants too and are utterly pathetic. Theseus undertakes to right the worst of their wrongs; he regains their dead for them so that the dead may be buried. But in aiding them, Theseus has had to make war on Thebes. True, it is a just war, a minor war, a war sanctioned by religious necessities . . . and one which will secure Argos as an ally with Athens in the future. It is war nevertheless; mixed, as is in evitable, in its motives, and therefore an uneasy solution to the dilemma confronting the intelligent man with pacifist leanings, which Theseus is meant clearly to be: and Theseus was most likely meant to have been, in the eyes of the Athenian audience, a mythical equivalent to Pericles himself, and the legendary war an equivalent to the war in which Athens found itself enmeshed. The impact of the victory which Theseus wins over Thebes is strangely and significantly muted. His success is no deterrent to Evadne's throwing herself on her husband's funeral pyre and no comfort to the procession of Argive mourners. Force, it seems, is pallid even in triumph over wrongs; and therein lies the tragedy. Meanwhile the real war between Athens and Sparta did not</page><page sequence="44">598 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS come to an end?it gradually carried the Athenian empire closer and closer to ruin. When the remnants of the great army thirsted to death in the quarries at Syracuse and the fleet was lost and the lonians were beginning to rebel, it must have become only too obvious that in desperate straits partisan intelligence is as delud ing as passionate bemusement. For Euripides, in any event, the time had come to give up on both. Both began with one-sided arguments and ended in fanaticism. Just as Hippolytus had been unnaturally devoted to hunting and Artemis, so Theseus in the Suppliant Women may be said to have been abnormally partial toward rationalizing and Athena, and the time had come to give up on all that sort of thing. At this juncture Euripides created a new drama, of which Ion is representative. No one knows what to call this group of plays?Ion, along with Helen and Iphigenia in Tauris. Neither tragedy nor comedy describes them; tragi-comedy suggests some thing so synthetic as to be useless; they go beyond romance j and rise far above melodrama. How they work, though, is no mystery. They are sumptuous pieces written for the Great Diony sia in Athens and as such are always dramatizations of the mytho logical past. They are big, spectacular, intensely poetical. Earlier, the dramatists had plotted their chief works for the festival so that the play ended in the death or near-death of the chief player, these terminations being the strongest they knew. But the road toward a particularly appropriate death could be discerned only in certain atmospheres, only in moments of transparent faith, when the protagonist's fault stood out mightily against a back ground of accepted virtues. These conditions never quite existed for Euripides; Medea, with all those faults of hers, flatly refused to die for him. So now he concentrated on the structure and the over-all theatrical effects essential to drama, exploiting grand spectacle and explosive plot, and letting the whole thing' work itself out, through skepticism and mockery and tenderness, toward</page><page sequence="45">HOWARD BAKER 599 a detached but vivacious ending. He brought an Ionian mode brilliantly into the theater. XII Ion dramatizes a festival. It is an impromptu festival to be sure, but not an insignificant one, since no less a personage than Creusa, Queen of Athens, has come with the King-consort and an enormous retinue to Delphi on a mission of some moment. The seriousness of the mission is not apparent at first. Creusa's women attendants come in gaily, like all celebrants and temple visitors, commenting on the sculptures, explicating for each other's benefit the myths depicted in the friezes, asking questions of one of the keepers of the sanctuary: "Is it true that Phoebus's house is built over the Earth's navel?" Answer: "Yes, and it's hung with garlands and watched over by Gorgon-eyes." Into the hubbub comes Creusa, the Queen, smoldering in Euripidean fashion with old wrongs and secret longings. In her the sight of the temple provokes strange agitations, which she can neither communicate nor conceal. When Xuthus, the King consort, appears, it is otherwise. Coarse in his prosperity as part ner in the rule of Athens, he sets about ostentatiously to offer first-fruits. He is determined, we soon detect, to wheedle from the god the one thing which he and Creusa lack?that is, off spring. He succeeds, or he thinks he does, and beyond all expectations. The oracle pronounces Ion, the young keeper of the shrine, son to him. Xuthus, trying to interpret the oracle, imagines himself to have been the begetter of a child one riotous night during another festival which he attended many years before; he re members enough of his revels to feel himself justified in claim ing Ion as his son. Ion accepts this preferment somewhat dubi ously . All that he knows about his own birth is that he was a foundling who was discovered in an open cradle on the temple steps. He is obliged in deference to Apollo's oracle to conclude</page><page sequence="46">600 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS that his father is indeed this stranger from Athens and his mother some totally forgotten Delphian girl. So he helps Xuthus to prepare a great public feast as a token of gratitude to the god. The most splendid tapestries in Apollo's treasure-house are bor rowed to make the pavilion. Euripides seems so far to be encouraging the weary Athenians attending their Dionysia to look in on the splendors and commo tions of another festival in bygone times. The scenes which he brings into the theater might have been suggested by those bright flashes that occur at the end of the Hymn to the Delian Apollo; his main interest is in movement, vitality, humor. But beneath all that, there is a much more complex grade of action, still vital, still humorous, but involving the erratic actions of the gods and the narrow intentions of their mortal respondents. On this level Euripides begins making drama in the spirit of the Homeric Hymn to Hermes. He invents heavenly deceptions, ruses, and counter-ruses. He manufactures a visible sort of magic which compares with the devices employed by the infant Hermes in the theft of his brother Apollo's sacred cattle: driving the animals backwards, for instance, so that their tracks would be misread; or making the lygos withes with which Apollo tries to bind him take root and grow into a thicket covering up and concealing the whole herd. In fact Ion in scenic ways resembles the famous vase paint ing which illustrates the Hymn; there in one view the little Hermes is to be seen cuddled innocently in his cradle, Apollo is glowering over him, and the sequestered cattle are well-concealed far back in the woods. But now in this festival drama Hermes, grown up and recon ciled with Apollo, has acted as prologue for the piece. From him we have learned that some years earlier Apollo had ravished the maiden Creusa in a cleft on the side of the Acropolis; that, at Apollo's request, Hermes had rescued the infant whom Creusa had given birth to in secrecy and had left to die in his cradle on the very spot where he had been begotten; and that it was Her</page><page sequence="47">HOWARD BAKER 601 mes who had carried the child in his cradle to Delphi and put him where he was found on the temple steps. The child of course is Ion; the mother of course is Creusa the Queen: though neither knows even so much as that the other exists. The King-consort of course is not the father, except by a deceptive way of speaking often resorted to among the gods. Hermes, having delivered this preliminary account of lucid facts and ingenious conceal ments, retreats into the laurel at the side of the temple plaza. He intends to stand by and wait with understandable curiosity to see what will happen. What happens is beyond divine foresight or reasonable pre diction, so entangled is the course of the action in the opaque ways of human life. Xuthus knows that Creusa will not share his new-found happiness in his presumed parenthood; yet he cannot contain himself in his feelings of good fortune; Creusa cannot abide this sudden turn of events, believing that for Apollo to award a bastard son to her consort, after having forced her to bear and then to expose their own child, is the god's final be trayal of her. In her fury Creusa sends an old manservant with a drop of Gorgon venom to the luxurious pavilion where the feast in Apollo's honor is about to begin. The old servant, with a grand Homeric show of hospitality, fills the wine cups, putting the poison into Ion's. As Ion lifts his arm to drink, something dis turbs him and he calls for the wine to be poured onto the ground as a libation. Doves descending in the Greek heat drink the spilled wine; the bird drinking from what had been in Ion's cup suddenly shakes, falls and thrashes on the ground, and dies in agony. Ion seizes the old manservant, forces a confession from him, and leads the pack of Delphian guests off in pursuit of Creusa. They intend to pitch her from the crags overhanging the holy place. When Creusa, forewarned, takes sanctuary on Apollo's altar in front of his temple, Ion, rationalizing away her right to sanctuary, advances to seize her. At this point the</page><page sequence="48">602 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS prophetess foster-mother of Ion comes from the temple. She is carrying a wicker-woven cradle in her hands. By means of this instrument and the tokens within it, the mother and son discover each other. Each is overwhelmed by the thought of the narrow chances that saved the mother from killing her child, the child his mother. Ah strange! Yet?midst the bright embraces of the sun Somewhere do such things day by day befall. . . . Though the winds of heaven have shifted to summer weather, the fact persists even into the closing lines of the play that both Ion and Creusa have reason to be discontented with Apollo; Xuthus too, but he is left in his fatuous ignorance. Creusa still finds Apollo's rape of her hard to forgive; Ion his deceits hard to reconcile. Both are aware of his present defection, in that he re fuses to speak for himself in an epilogue. Their Ionian descend ants will share now and again in their ancestors' bewilderment. Yet it is to be noted, and Ionic wit will never forget, that neither a burning indignation such as Creusa's nor a wounded sense of integrity such as Ion's quite composes the essential di mension in a human being. More significant than his skepticism is Ion's many-sidedness. We saw him in the first place lightly and gracefully embattled with the birds that befoul the temple, and at the peak of the action furiously leaping a table at the feast to crush the poisoner. Creusa is as intricately presented; she is both the girl weaving a coverlet for her unborn child and the mutely resentful childless older woman. Ion is more complex than any of its facets can possibly suggest. In it, there is no single line of action that can be abstracted, no ethical argument or political message; there is only the total action, the total art. The plot reduces itself not to a logical narra tive, but rather to a show, as Euripides says, of strange things happening amidst the embraces of the sun: human things, but as</page><page sequence="49">HOWARD BAKER 603 unexpected as if they were the product of the Heraclitean fire, and as puzzling as the fossil impressions of fish which Xenophanes found in the rocks in the mountains of Syracuse. The Athenians, on the verge of collapse as head of a proud empire and as a city of independent people, were treated to a view of a realm where issues were not razor-sharp, where the Middle was not rigorously excluded, where ideology was not supreme law; the gods therefore could be their despicable selves when they had to and could still be honored from day to day. The descendants of Ion were not rigid. The Persians with their ruthless enterprises had taught them flexibility. So had the Athenians, when under Pericles in 439 B. C. they destroyed Samos and transformed the Delian league of Ionic people into an imperialist Athenian monopoly from which there was no appeal. Now, when Ion was being played in the Great Dionysia some thirty years later and the lonians were rebelling and the empire crumbling, one wonders what the feelings were out in the vast audience. One wonders whether there may not have been some envy of the Ionic attitudes which were enlivening the stage. Or perhaps it was too late for envy. Perhaps the irreversible heavi ness of spirits was already upon them. We can hardly imagine their own Athena making herself heard and understood if she were to say to them in cheerful Ionic tones what she had said to Odysseus when he had complained about her hard dealings with him: Always the same detachment! That is why I cannot fail you in your evil fortune, coolheaded, quick, well-spoken as you are. . . , (Fitzgerald translation) XIII It is tempting to try to conclude a discussion of this kind by asserting: "Thus, as we have seen, the religious attitudes of the</page><page sequence="50">604 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS lonians add up to this . . ." and then to set about constructing a summarizing paragraph. But nothing, I think, could be more in appropriate here. What we have been busy doing, as I see it, has been a job of cutting and pasting together the pieces of a sketchy model of an ancient experience, in the hope that it might be com parable in some interesting ways with our own experience. Our model has a certain little wholeness, and if it is any good at all a vibrancy and flexibility, which rule out the possibility of saying exactly what that old experience was; of saying, for example, exactly what the r?le of religion was in it. Final pronouncements become a smothering tissue of terminologies and biases. But from the whole model a certain amount of meaning may burst forth here and there. We can remark that the greatest oddity of the experience was no doubt its avoidance of dogmatism. Of the other faiths and philosophies which have touched the modern world most directly, it appears that each has presumed to build on a rock: on a theos, a prophet, a trinity, or?following Aristotle?on an intellectual arche, which in his case was God and the goodly operation of the cosmos. The objective of each system was to establish structural finality, to create a coherence which would be wanting in no re spect and to which there could be no exceptions. The lonians betrayed no such compulsions. Even in speculative inquiry, they were casual about finalities. For example: Aristotle said about Herodotus that his archaic (and Ionic) way of writing his prose in the Histories was out of date. The historian's style, he said, was loose and free-running; the goal of the narrative was never kept in sight; the stopping point came only when he ran out of subject matter. Aristotle found the whole thing extremely unsatisfactory. What Aristotle required was a proper beginning and a proper ending, with the period in the middle held to a direction which is foreseeable at a glance. The difference between the two methods, or the two styles, he adds, is the difference between the indefinite and the</page><page sequence="51">HOWARD BAKER 605 definite?or between, as we would say, archaic openness on the one hand and classical finality on the other. But in certain situations the definite is not possible nor desir able; the indefinite is necessary and deeply to be preferred. The work of Herodotus, from my point of view, is actually a perfect case in point, but it is by no means the only one: I think of Ludwig Wittgenstein's preface to his Philosophical Investiga tions, in which he says, I have written down all these thoughts as remarks, short paragraphs, of which there is sometimes a fairly long chain about the same subject, while I sometimes make a sudden change, jumping from one topic to another. ?It was my intention at first to bring all this together in a book whose form I pictured differently at different times. . . . After several unsuccessful attempts to weld my results together into such a whole, I realized that I should never succeed. The best that I could write would never be more than philo sophical remarks; my thoughts were soon crippled if I tried to force them on in a single direction against their natural inclination. ?And this was, of course, connected with the very nature of the investigation. . . . And Wittgenstein's investigations, needless to say, were directly concerned with the very processes of mind which enable us to put words together and perhaps to make sentences out of them and possibly even books. Wittgenstein's patient acceptance of the fragmentariness of the ways of consciousness has, like a rare and beautiful coin, an ob verse in the worried resistance with which Alfred Einstein met the implications of fragmentariness in atomic science. The star ing vacancies, the irrational congestions and decongestions in the structure of matter, which could be accounted for only along non-deterministic lines by quantum theory, led him to put his per plexities in these words: "Some physicists, among them myself, can not believe that we must abandon, actually and forever, the 7</page><page sequence="52">606 THE IONIANS AND THEIR GODS idea of direct representation of physical reality in space and time; or that we must accept the view that events in nature are analo gous to a game of chance." We can hope that Einstein's faith will be rewarded and that Wittgenstein's skepticism will not completely silence us, but only chasten us, in our efforts to speak. At the same time we can sus pect that at one frontier after another difficulties will continue to haunt us, that the patterns which things reveal under scrutiny will always have their resemblances to a cast of the knuckle-bones or the inscrutable countenances of the gods. XIV By one of the prettier casts of fortune, a sense of Ionia and the temples of Ionia can be encountered where you would least ex pect to find it. Well below the looming classical masses of the Acropolis of Athens but not far from the theater of Dionysus, at the very place where Deucalion's flood is said to have subsided into the sacred river Ilissos, there stands on the low bank a cluster of fifteen or sixteen enormously tall, fluted columns, most of them still tied together on top by their clear-cut architraves. This is what is left of the temple of Olympian Zeus, begun under the Pisistratids, wholly Ionian in its conception, imitating Ephesus and Samos, and colossal in its dimensions. Work on the structure was broken off when the Pisistratids fell in 510 B.C., but was resumed from time to time later on, until finally Hadrian conse crated the new-old temple in 131-132 A. D. In the course of the centuries Pentelic marble replaced the original tufa; the Corinthian order took over from the Ionic; but the temple never ceased being colossal, and not quite manageable, in its proportions. It ended by becoming a gigantic forest of columns, which re mained partly open to the sky. Though nearly all have fallen now, those still standing perpetuate a brilliance which people once found peculiarly enjoyable.</page></plain_text>
