<plain_text><page sequence="1">"HERE AND NOW" STORIES IN RUSSIA- AN EXPERIMENT VERA FEDIAEVSKY Department of Children's Literature and Story-telling, Pedagogical Technicum, Moscow, Russia The Institute of Out-School Work, Moscow, has as one of its chief aims the experimental study of children's perceptions and interests at different ages. Story-telling has been one of the means employed in attaining this aim, and for nearly four years the section on children's reading has been undertaking studies in this field as one branch of its program. In order to obtain definite results in a scientific experiment, it is generally conceded that the experiment must be repeated under exactly the same conditions and again under distinctly different con- ditions. Such perfect precision cannot be obtained in a story-telling experiment, because the subjects used in the experiment and the means of stimulation are never identical. Two audiences consisting of children can never be absolutely alike, although the children may be of the same age, of the same sex, and of the same social status. Other children; other capacities and abilities; other experiences, dispositions, and types of organization; and other conditions of health must be assumed. Moreover, the audience may be listening to the story after work at school, after a long walk, or, perhaps, after a quarrel, and all these conditions tend to alter reactions. Thus, we can never repeat the experiment in the exact sense of the word. A children's audience today is inevitably other than it was yesterday. Though we relate the same story and though the audience is com- posed of the same individuals, the audience yesterday was hearing the story as something new, while today it listens to it as a repetition, as something already known. Nor can the stimulator be identical. While the same story-teller may be telling the same story, his intona- tions and the degree of his enthusiasm can never be quite the same. The impossibility of repeating an experiment exactly concerns 278</page><page sequence="2">"HERE AND NOW" STORIES IN RUSSIA 279 not only story-telling. It is a general condition of the study of com- plicated human reactions; particularly is this true in the case of studies that are based on groups rather than on individuals. The pre- cision of the findings in any such study, therefore, can be but rela- tive. Nevertheless, it is possible to arrive at certain conclusions, in the shaping of which the general picture yielded by our observations is especially helpful. The experiments conducted by the section on children's reading have been carried on in the following way. Before a story is begun, the name of each of the children who are to listen to it is recorded, together with the sex and the age. The audiences vary, but usually they consist in part of a nucleus of constant listeners, so that many are already known to the workers of the institute. They are mostly of proletarian origin. The main groups are three in number: pre- school children (four to seven years of age), children of the primary grades (eight to ten years of age), and children from eleven to fourteen years of age. Sometimes a special audience is formed-for example, when a neighboring nursery school is invited or when the audience is purposely composed entirely of girls or of children of a certain age. While the story-teller is telling the story, a responsible assistant makes detailed notes of the children's reactions to it; marks the heightening or abating of their attention; records their comments, their exclamations, their smiles, and, their laughter, and the general frame of mind of the audience. In order to make these records easily and effectively, we have adopted conventional signs for the evalua- tion of the attention of the audience, from a sign indicating active inattention on the one hand to a sign indicating complete absorption on the other. Several other adults are usually present. When the story is finished, both the story and the record are discussed; thus the ob- servations of the assistant are completed and verified by the story- teller and by the other adults present. Sometimes the story is em- phasized by a subsequent talk with the children on the same day or on the following day. At other times it is accompanied by their dramatization of it, by their retelling of it, or by some other method of bringing out the impressions that they have received. Sometimes</page><page sequence="3">280 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [December pictures relating to the story are hung up for the children to see; this gives them an opportunity to express their suppositions and ap- preciations. These reflections and all that the story gives rise to are recorded. Thus abundant materials are gathered for the study of the perceptions and the reactions of children listening to a story in a large group. In the study here described my purpose was to give an illustra- tion of this kind of work and of the resulting records. I wished also to learn the effect of the same story on children of different ages so as to be able to draw practical conclusions with regard to its fitness for a given age. Furthermore, I was interested in acquainting groups of Russian children with stories from the Here and Now Story Book, written by Lucy Sprague Mitchell, and in seeing how far this ma- terial would prove suitable for them. The study was conducted chiefly in the section on children's reading attached to the Institute of Out-School Work. In addition, the children from several kinder- gartens and a few outside groups were included. Ten of the stories from the Here and Now Story Book were used: (i) "The Room with the Window Looking Out on the Garden," (2) "The Rooster and the Hens," (3) "My Horse, Old Dan," (4) "How Spot Found a Home," (5) "The Journey," (6) "How the Engine Learned the Knowing Song," (7) "Things That Loved the Lake," (8) "Boris Takes a Walk and Finds Many Different Kinds of Trains," (9) "Speed," (io) "Eben's Cows." Several of these stories were re- peated to groups of different ages so that in all twenty-four experi- ments were made. The majority of Mrs. Mitchell's stories vividly depict the life of an American city. For this reason they appeal to the American child, and for the same reason they appear alien to a Russian child. A Russian child is aroused to interest in them only when the sphere of his interests widens and takes in not only his immediate surround- ings, the "here and now," but the more remote "there and then." There are, however, other reasons why the age of the American children for whom these stories are intended does not coincide with the age at which Russian children enjoy them. American children live in a country with highly developed industries, and, by reason of this fact, their interest in technical matters is probably awakened</page><page sequence="4">1925] "HERE AND. NOW" STORIES IN RUSSIA 281 much earlier than is the case with Russian children. Many of Mrs. Mitchell's stories deal in detail with the achievements of mechanical science and tell of steam engines, steamships, automobiles, aero- planes, milking machines, subways, and elevated railways. Both of these considerations lead to the conclusion that the stories are suit- able for Russian children of an age somewhat more advanced than that for which the author intended them. Experience has proved these suppositions to be correct. Thus, the stories "Boris Takes a Walk" and "Speed" were written for chil- dren from six to seven years of age, whereas they were listened to with the greatest amount of interest by Russian children of primary- school age, that is, children from eight to ten years old. I told some of the stories not only to kindergarten and primary-school groups but successively to groups of all ages from five to ten years, inclusive. For example, I read the story "How the Engine Learned the Know- ing Song," which is intended by the author for children five years old. The younger children listened attentively, but the story did not enter into their lives. On the other hand, the children of eight, nine, and even ten years of age were untroubled by its naivet6 and listened to it with great interest. However, it was the seven-year- old children who enjoyed it most. It was reflected in their play and in their talk. They built engines of chairs and blocks and made them perform all the movements described in the story, while they con- stantly repeated the refrain: All in good time, my engine, Steady, steady 'Til you're ready, Learn to know Before you go. More than that, the children began to use this refrain among themselves to check one another's impulsiveness. One day they told me that they had been to the Kursk railway station, had seen the engine, and had "understood everything that it said." In a word, the story had entered into their lives. All the children, however, whatever their ages, listened to this story with interest and caught up the refrain and the sounds of the engine. What are the conditions under which children take the keenest</page><page sequence="5">282 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [December interest in a story and retain the most lasting impressions from it? I should say when the story is in some way connected with personal experience. The younger the child, the greater must be the relation be- tween the story and his experience. The seven-year-old children, there- fore, who had seen an engine more than once and had perhaps trav- eled by train took more interest in "How the Engine Learned the Knowing Song" than did the younger children. This supposition was confirmed when I told the story of "The Journey," which I adapted to the conditions of a journey in Russia. This story had no success whatever when told to kindergarten chil- dren in our section of the institute. The children listened listlessly; the reiteration of the names of the stations and of the sounds of the train evidently seemed to them dull and monotonous. Yet the same story, told to a group of preschool children in a resthouse in the Crimea, pleased the listeners immensely. They took an active part in the story, imitating the different sounds of the train. The reasons for this success and for the earlier failure are clear. In the first case railway trains were evidently unknown to the audience. In the second case all the children had recently traveled to the Crimea, so that they still retained vivid impressions of their railway journey; perhaps even the names of some of the stations and the familiar sounds "Din-din! Oo-oo-oo-oo! Tchoo-tchoo, tchoo-tchoo!" evoked familiar images. Even a girl of two years of age, whom I had not succeeded in sending out of the room before the beginning of the story, became interested in it and interjected remarks: "And my mama took a porter!" etc. If children of different ages and of different personal experi- ences are differently affected by a story, the fact may be due to their sex. More than once we find such notes as these in our records: "The boys show more interest than the girls." "The boys are more completely carried away than are the girls." Such notes were made especially in connection with those stories where mechanical ap- pliances play a part. The points that appeal to boys and to girls are not always the same. Thus, in the story "Boris Takes a Walk," the boys were interested in the fact that "Boria traveled by train," while a little girl was especially pleased because "Boria cried and one felt so sorry for him." When the story of "Eben's Cows" was told,</page><page sequence="6">X925] "HERE AND NOW" STORIES IN RUSSIA 283 the little girls' emotional reactions were characteristic. They liked the calf's licking the face and hands of the small hero. They were pleased with Eben's petting the calf. They laughed and were de- lighted at the calves' being called "little sisters." If there were mo- ments when the boys or the girls reacted in a way characteristic of their sex, there were still more-many more-moments when they all reacted simply as children. What is there in these stories that gives them their appeal to children? It is the motion, the imitation of sounds, the refrains, and the form. Children are, by nature, essentially active. Not only do they live by action and movement; they even "think with their muscles." Therefore, out in the street, it is the moving objects that interest them most. The tram and the engine are their favorites. The action in the story is requisite to its success. Thus, it is char- acteristic that the children should be completely carried away by the story "Boris Takes a Walk" in spite of the absence of an entertain- ing plot. During my telling of this story, the children went into every detail as if they themselves were traveling, walking, and seeing everything with Boris. The more lively among them anticipated the events, interposed remarks, imitated the sounds, and represented the movements. On the following day many were eager to tell the story in their own words, and the retelling was distinguished by minute- ness and accuracy. It was interesting to note the motor vivacity of the oral rendering and of the gestures that emphasized the words. One boy, for example, when saying "the moujik turned the handle," imitated with his hands how it had been done. A little girl, in speak- ing of the elevated station, described it as a "sort of a very small house," and, indicating its height with a gesture of the hand, said, "He lifted his head," and tilted her head back to show just how Boris had done it. There is another curious feature of the retelling of these stories. The child creates in his mind images of his own, originated by the story in connection with his personal experiences, and the impression of his previous experiences is so vivid that at times he perceives in thought something quite other than what is described to him. The same boy mentioned in the preceding paragraph named Moscow, al- though it was not mentioned at all in my story, but evidently Russia</page><page sequence="7">284 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [December does not exist for him outside of Moscow. In describing the subway train, he said, "The black engine is coming on, huge, enormous," al- though I had not mentioned anything of the kind. In his imagination a train is evidently inseparably linked with a big black engine. Another boy, when describing how Boris traveled by the subway, said, "He was looking out of the window and saw fields and woods." Evidently, this boy had traveled by train and had seen fields and for- ests from the window, and so vividly had the impression remained with him that it entirely superseded my description of how the sub- way train scudded through a tunnel with white tiles, the cars flooded with electric light. A little girl added in her rendering that "Boria's mother allowed him to take a walk but forbade him to go far." Ap- parently, she was accustomed to such instructions from her mother. A seven-year-old girl even managed to hear the guard of the New York elevated train call out to the passengers, "Gretchikhino Sta- tion!" In all other details her telling of how Boris took a walk in New York was remarkably accurate. One of the features to be especially prized in the stories in the Here and Now Story Book is that they afford an outlet for the child's natural activity. This is accomplished in two ways. First, as in the story "The Room with a Window Looking Out on the Garden," the children themselves may supplement certain details. For ex- ample, one child may say that a certain boy showed the little girl who had just entered the kindergarten where to find the blocks; another, that she was shown where the clay was, the crayons, and so on. The successful telling of this story is possible, of course, only with an audience of children familiar with all the surroundings of a kindergarten and with the kinds of work and play carried on in it. Again, the story may provide for the children's catching up of a refrain or acting certain parts by imitating different sounds. Thus, in the case of the story "How the Engine Learned the Knowing Song," where the engineer is trying the new engine, we find in our records: "The children became very animated. They were all eager to be the whistle or the steam or the sand. One of the girls, ten years of age, very much wished to puff, and at the close all the children were hissing and whistling together with the story-teller. Both girls and boys took part in the rendering of the sounds, but the boys were</page><page sequence="8">1925] "HERE AND NOW" STORIES IN RUSSIA 285 more completely carried away." In the older audience each child took up the part allotted to him. The youngest children were not equal to the distribution of parts, and all repeated the same sounds indiscriminately. The reproduction of sounds and refrains as they occur is called for by the majority of Mrs. Mitchell's stories. "The Journey" is based almost entirely on the reproduction of the sounds of a train. Sound occupies a large place in "The Rooster and the Hens." Dur- ing the telling of this story, kindergarten children paid marked atten- tion to every hen's cackle and every cock's crow, sometimes imitat- ing them and sometimes introducing remarks about the cocks and the hens that lived in the same courtyards with them. The notes re- cording the telling of "Boris Takes a Walk" point out that with each recurring sound of the different vehicles "the children were carried away." Every new description of the crossroad brought with it new animation, "many of the children forestalling the story and imitat- ing the sounds of an automobile or of a truck." When the sounds of the subway train were described, the children took up and repeated "rackety, clackety!" "Speed" is another story containing words imitating sounds, and the reports record the fact that "attention reached its climax when sounds were imitated." The story "How Spot Found a Home" reproduces mewings and purrings, which al- ways caught the children's attention. One of them even said serious- ly, "How well she knows the cat's talk!" Not only did the children imitate the sounds while the tale was being told, but they sometimes continued to imitate them on their way home. It must be remarked that if the preschool children take sound imitation seriously, the younger groups of school children, while imitating sounds with relish, sometimes, from the vantage ground of their eight years, look on such doings with contempt and consider them child's play. In general, it is interesting to note that just as the attitude toward the imitation of sounds is different with the older and the younger children, though it gives pleasure to them all, so also the relation of the story to the child differs according to the age of the child, even though it finds favor with all. Thus, preschool children enjoy the story "How Spot Found a Home" for its serious and enter- taining content. They are just able to grasp it. The primary-school</page><page sequence="9">286 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [December children listen to it with rapture, but at the same time they feel that it is somewhat beneath them, and they listen as adults would listen to an amusing anecdote. I had wished to observe the effect of rhythm on children, and experience proved my hypothesis to be right, for, in the records of the telling of "How the Engine Learned the Knowing Song," we find: "Whenever we came to parts with a rhythmical measure, or to a song, the children's attention was heightened." The same thing was noted with other stories. In "How Spot Found a Home" atten- tion grew every time that Spot began to purr. Purrr, purrr, Curling up warm To a ball of fur, I close my eyes And purr and purr. Purrr, purrr, Purrr, purrr. The children immediately began smiling in expectation of the well-known, comfortable scene. The song of the fire was especially liked. I crickle, I crackle, I flicker, I flare, I jump from nothing right into the air. One of the stories, "My Horse, Old Dan," is nothing but a rhythmical enumeration of the parts of a horse's body. Neverthe- less, the children not only listened with pleasure, in spite of the ab- sence of the story element, but immediately asked for a repetition. When I complied, several began prompting me. Certainly every word in "My Horse, Old Dan" became familiar to them, and the rhythm pleased them and made immediate memorizing possible. Mrs. Mitchell's stories are profoundly true to life in their sub- ject matter, but this does not prevent the author's giving them cer- tain elements of the fairy tale. She makes things and animals talk, taking into account children's partiality to anthropomorphism and animism. Sometimes she gives a series of personifications. Thus she meets the children halfway, and in this characteristic of her stories the children feel something that answers their needs.</page><page sequence="10">1925] "HERE AND NOW" STORIES IN RUSSIA 287 The story of "Speed" is based on personifications and deals with the various modes of transportation. In the notes made during the telling of this story, we find: "The children listened very attentively. Every time that a new vehicle was introduced, they began guessing by the sounds: 'That is a tram!' 'That is a car, isn't it?"' This guess- ing has great attraction for the listeners. For instance, in "Boris Takes a Walk," I said, "The man lifted his stick, and suddenly everything seemed as if turned to stone." "I know!" cried the chil- dren, "It is the policeman!" The description of the elevated station gave rise to the surmise, "That must be the theater!" All these sur- mises and guesses give the children opportunity for activity during the story-telling. On the other hand, just as movement and action delight them, so do description and argument leave children indifferent. My ex- perience with Mrs. Mitchell's stories once more confirmed this fact, so frequently noted by story-tellers. In reading "Speed," attention slackened when we came to the reflections of the ox and of the steam- boat and in "Eben's Cows" at the description of the parents' life, of how they did the milking, etc. It was for this same reason that the delicate story, "Things That Loved the Lake," consisting chiefly of descriptions of the lake and its inhabitants, failed to please the children. "Eben's Cows" is very different in character from the rest of the stories. It is informational, or, as Russians call it, a "production story." The side of it which concerns production is cleverly given as a background to the picture. Mrs. Mitchell believes that, in an in- formational story, the process described should come in only as part of the environment, that the story itself must not be concerned with the details of production. In this story she shows the transition from milking by hand to machine-milking, but the whole of the informa- tional matter is treated just as a background to the purely childlike events in the life of Eben and his little sister. Thus the story keeps in touch with the child and does not lose its artistic value. In my opinion, it is a standard story on production lines. When this story was read, the children, although not markedly interested, were fairly attentive at first, as their remarks showed. Thus, after the word "cow"-it was Eben's first word-one boy</page><page sequence="11">288 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [December asked, "Was he a very little boy?" After the words, "Every cow has a calf every year," another boy remarked in a business-like tone, "Even two sometimes." Real interest showed itself only when the second part of the story was reached. It began to rise from the moment when Eben and Nancy are alone in the woods by the brook; evening comes on, they grow uneasy because their parents do not return; they enter the cow barn. The cows stand there unmilked, stamping their feet and flicking their tails. The children listened with great interest as Eben and his sister with difficulty succeed in milking the cows, in putting the milk through the separator, and in feeding the calves. The surprise awaiting the parents took the chil- dren's fancy; they were delighted at the words spoken by the father, "We must make haste; the poor cows are not milked." They smiled at the father's astonishment at finding everything done. When the story was finished, they clamored "Tell it again!" The next day "Eben's Cows" was discussed, a little girl retelling the story intelli- gently. Some of the stories I told exactly as they are given by the author. In others I introduced a few changes when telling them to small children, replacing the American names by Russian ones, for ex- ample. For the older children, however, I let the original names stand. One story, "The Journey," I adapted to Russian conditions. This story is so simple and easy that it is especially well suited to very young children, but I thought that the strange setting might confuse the children. CONCLUSIONS To what conclusions do the experiments with the stories from the Here and Now Story Book lead? How did the various groups of chil- dren respond to them? (i) The stories affect children differently ac- cording to the age of the child. This is true not only in the sense that children of a certain age are able to understand and enjoy a story which younger children are unable to understand and enjoy but also in the sense that the children's attitudes toward the sub- ject matter of a story differ at different ages. Thus, what the young- er children listen to as serious subject matter is still attractive to the older children, but they find it merely entertaining or amusing. It would appear, too, that the same story may be suitable for children of different nationalities at different ages. (2) The reactions of chil-</page><page sequence="12">1925] "HERE AND NOW" STORIES IN RUSSIA 289 dren differ according to their sex. (3) The effect of a story depends in great measure on what the children concerned may have seen or experienced. What special portions or characteristics of the stories were most successful in arousing active responses from the children? (i) Chil- dren, being characteristically active themselves, exhibit strong re- sponses to action in the story. A good example of this is given by the story "Boris Takes a Walk," which interests the children in spite of the almost total absence of plot. In retelling this story, children manifest their active nature in the words which they use as well as in the gestures which they make. (2) Children are strongly influ- enced by sound imitation. They repeat the sound and make it their own. The telling of nearly any one of the stories in the Here and Now Story Book will afford evidences of this. (3) Children are sym- pathetically sensitive to rhythm and even show themselves ready to use it in speaking, as was the case after hearing the story "My Horse, Old Dan." (4) Children enjoy the clear-cut form usually found in folk-lore and adopted by Mrs. Mitchell for her stories. It is characterized by well-balanced subdivisions, repetitions tending to a climax, and refrains concluding each separate part and, like mile- stones, marking the way the traveler has come. (5) The element of the marvelous-personification-appeals to children by reason of their bent toward animism and anthropomorphism and is felt by them to be something peculiarly their own. (6) Children respond to incidents that give play to their activity, whether in the form of amplifying the story or in the form of repeating sounds and refrains. (7) Children are eager to seize the opportunity of guessing. Guessing permits them to enter more fully into the story. The experiment has also led to the conclusion that the descrip- tive parts of a story and the discussions produce an undesirable effect-wandering of the attention. This was apparent in the case of the description of the usual process of milking in "Eben's Cows" and in the case of the reflections of the ox in "Speed." In addition, it has been found that stories retold by children with misstatements that are not to be considered as fortuitous sometimes allow us to judge of the double character of a child's perception. We may see in them the powerful influence of previous experience over actual per- ception.</page></plain_text>
