This passage quotes a "certain Chinese ency- clopaedia" in which it is written that "ani- mals are divided into: (a) belonging to the Emperor, (b) embalmed, (c) tame, (d) sucking pigs, (e) sirens, (f) fabulous, (g) stray dogs, (h) included in the present classification, (i) fren- zied, (j) innumerable, (k) drawn with a very fine camelhair brush, (1) etcetera, (m) having just broken the water pitcher, (n) that from a long way off look like flies. "In the wonder- ment of this taxonomy, the thing we appre- hend in one great leap, the thing that, by means of the fable is demonstrated as the ex- otic charm of another system of thought, is the limitation of our own, the stark impossi- bility of thinking that. Michel Foucault, The Order of Things, 1970 w ¥ ¥ ¥ ¥ hen I entered graduate school at Columbia University in 1965, Douglas Fraser was away on sabbatical, and I spent my first year studying with Paul Wingert, just before his retirement. Wingert was among the first art historians to define "primitive art" as a field of academic study. His approach to primi- tive art was then called the "style-area" method. Works of art - for Wingert that meant primarily sculpture - were analyzed in language derived from the study of mod- ern art. Wingert would discuss a figure in terms of shapes, surfaces, and transitional passages, articulating in words the nature of the artist's conventions. He defined style by the conventions of a few normative pieces in each tribe or tribal area.1 In a very short time we learned the criteria of each style, the names of the ethnic groups, and their geographic locations on the map. In one ac- ademic year we could tell Bamana from Baule (figs, i, 2) and could identify the tribal styles of Africa, Oceania, and North America. Learning these tribal styles transformed primitive art into a finite group of coherent, familiar traditions. Wingert assured us that we now knew everything there was to know on the subject and cautioned us against reading a lot of new-fangled books that merely confused the picture. Douglas Fraser returned the following year and assigned us all the books Wingert had warned against. I still think back with nostalgia to that brief period of intellectual certainty engendered in us by Wingert. The recognition that each ethnic group had its own style was indeed momentous: it provided an easy way to distinguish be- 15</page><page sequence="3">i.

More important, by having distinct styles, each of these peo- ples became comparable to a chronological period or to the work of an artist belonging to the canon of Western art. The style-area method was significant to the processes through which non- Western objects were validated as works of art and primitive man was reevaluated positively. The mere fact that these people had ethnic styles of such l6 PASZTORY</page><page sequence="4">clarity indicated that they were creative an- imals like us and belonged to the family of man. The style-area method was first devised in museums as a classification scheme for sorting artifacts from around the world. For example, Olbrechts based his classic work of 1946, Plastiek van Congo, on the organ- ization of materials deposited in the Belgian Musee Royale de PAfrique Centrale, Ter- vuren.2 Classification was also a useful way of organizing the material for art history classes. Intellectually, however, the con- cept was riddled with difficulties. For one thing the concept was entirely ahistorical, assuming that these styles had existed in these forms from time immemorial. This was due in part to the nature of the ma- terials themselves - most of the arts were created in perishable media in tropical cli- mates where wood decays normally in fifty to a hundred years. With a few exceptions, old works of art were not available for the creation of an art history. This supported the prevailing opinion that these cultures were extremely traditional and the notion that, like living fossils, they had preserved the lifestyles of early and neolithic man. In this context, discussion of the origin and development of styles was unlikely; the tribal styles were seen as a spontaneous and vague reflection of a given ethnic group's personality or "genius." The modern con- cept of Afro-American "soul" derives from this idea. A second and I think even greater prob- lem is that from the viewpoint of style area, the only cultures that existed on our mental map were those with distinctive art styles. In addition to the list we memorized in graduate school, there were groups whose style was neither consistent nor coherent from object to object, groups whose style seemed to be an uncomfortable blend of their neighbors' styles, and those whose art works were so rudimentary that one could not speak of a "style" at all. There also seemed to be groups not particularly inter- ested in the visual arts. We dealt with these groups either by ascribing to them the in- ferior status of "minor artists," on the model of Western art, or by simply disregarding them. While art style was used to validate the worth of some groups, its absence was used to banish others to a limbo of uncrea- tivity, which meant nonexistence. "Oh yes, the Tiv, they don't do anything. ..." The question not asked by Wingert and his generation was, why do some people develop distinctive styles at certain times and others do not? What circumstances fa- vor the development of group styles? This question was never asked because it was assumed that ethnic styles emerged spon- taneously. The very existence of ethnic style was taken as proof of its universal exist- ence. Consider, for example, the Maya vil- lages of Guatemala where the men and women of each village have their own style of weaving and embroidery, which distin- guishes each village's, and each person's, ethnic identity (figs. 3, 4).3 Such distin- guishing style could be perceived in folk villages anywhere around the world. Since it was assumed that if folk cultures do something it must be universal, the issue of ethnic style seemed to need little more explanation than a reference to the collec- tive unconscious. This was not strange to us in the Western tradition in which Eng- lish, French, Italian, and German styles in art, music, and literature are clear and ap- parently self-evident. I will try to show that our very notion of group style emerges from, and is defined by, our Western experience of ethnicity and art, and that other, differ- ent concepts of style and ethnicity may ex- ist but have not been examined. I will seek to show that just because the phenomenon of ethnic division through style is wide- spread, it is not necessarily a psychological or social universal. I shall try to determine what functions ethnic styles might fulfill in various societies on the basis of a few selected examples. First, however, a note on the word "eth- nic," which conveys several meanings. In a landmark study, Ethnic Groups and Boundaries, Fredrik Barth defined an ethnic group as having four central aspects: a self- perpetuating biology (sometimes racial), a shared basic culture, a shared system of communication (usually language), and a personally affirmed identity.4 His study suggests that the concepts of ethnic groups, cultures, language groups, and societies are so interwoven that they are hard to unravel. Ethnographers are accustomed to talking PASZTORY 17</page><page sequence="5">3- Solala, Guatemala, modern men in native dress Photograph by Otis Imboden, from David Stuart, et al.; The Mysterious Maya (© National Geographic Soci- ety, Washington, 1977), 185 4- Chichicastenango, Guate- mala, modern women in native dress Photograph by Jerry Jackna © 1979, from Mary G. Dieterich, et al., Guate- malan Costumes (Phoenix, 1979), frontispiece about "tribal" groups, sociologists about "ethnic" groups, archaeologists about "cul- tures," and historians about "peoples and societies." I have chosen to use the term "ethnic" because it encompasses language, culture, and society. I shall use other terms as needed. One aspect of the meaning of ethnic styles has already been discussed in terms of the style-area approach to the study of non- Western art; there is no question that the presence of ethnic styles enabled Western outsiders to more easily grasp different cul- tures, the necessary first step before we could evaluate such cultures positively or negatively. The basic function of an ethnic style is to create a coherent visual form that func- tions as a badge of identity within the group; by projecting the image of a self, ethnic style immediately implies the existence of others who do not belong. Ethnic styles cre- ate identity and difference through the for- mal articulation of visual images, ranging from dress to architecture. Barth has noted that ethnic identity is not created once and for all. The dynamics of ethnic identity re- quire all individuals to make continuous affirmations of their sense of belonging and of their culture's acceptance. In this process, visual symbols in works of art are essential, they are continuously needed, and are manufactured. The meaning of styles as badges of iden- tity has been wonderfully exploited in car- toons (fig. 5). The young lady in the Punch cartoon rejects her suitor solely because he is drawn in pre-Columbian style. The point of the joke is that we grasp the difference between the styles and identify with the style of the girl and her mama. In identi- fying with them we also do not see their style as consisting of arbitrary signs but as the normal representation of forms and concepts. Thus the essence of stylistic iden- tification is to see our own style as natural 18 PASZTORY</page><page sequence="6">5. Cartoon, Punch magazine (London, 12 December 1984), 42 6.

Wagner 1985.104 and the style of the other as artificial and literally unnatural, or against nature. My attention was first drawn to the uses and meanings of ethnic styles by a few highly unusual works of Mesoamerican art that juxtapose two different styles, as if in a Eu- ropean painting one figure were in the style of Rogier van der Weyden and the other in that of Piero della Francesca. On the Bazan Slab, found at Monte Alban in Oaxaca, two figures are incised in stone (fig. 6). The fig- ure in front is an anthropomorphic jaguar named 3 Turquoise. He is represented in flowing curvilinear lines. Behind him, 8 Turquoise is rendered in angular lines and shapes that approximate geometric forms such as squares, circles, triangles, and tra- pezoids. The figure of 8 Turquoise is rep- resented in the style of Teotihuacan, a con- temporary of Monte Alban, 350 kilometers from Oaxaca.5 The Teotihuacan-style fig- ure is very close to Teotihuacan priest fig- ures found on mural paintings and pottery (fig. 7). Its identity is further indicated by a tasseled headdress glyph that may be either a name or rank, found in the column of glyphs before the figure on the Bazan Slab. Although I consider such style juxtapo- sitions theoretically and culturally highly significant, I must emphasize that they are very rare in Mesoamerican art. Neverthe- less, I consider them symptomatic and therefore far more important than their rar- ity might suggest. Significantly, most are found in the classic period, a point to which I will return later. A possible contemporary stela, dated a.d. 445, from the Maya city of Tikal, shows on its front the ruler Stormy Sky sur- rounded by curvilinear scrolls and masked personifications (fig. 8).6 The side figures PASZTORY 19</page><page sequence="7">8.

A tas- seled headdress similar to the Teotihuacan representations is shown on the head of the deity on the shield (fig. 9). The central figure is clearly and entirely Maya in style. The side figures are composites: their linear simplicity and angular composition are close to Teotihuacan style, while the proportions and naturalistic details are Maya. The iden- tity of the side figure is not clear, and it is unclear as well whether the two views are of one figure or two figures. He is described in much of the popular scholarly literature as an "ambassador" from Teotihuacan but more recently has been identified as the father of Stormy Sky, who may have orig- inated from a Teotihuacan dynasty. Teo- tihuacan is nearly a thousand kilometers from Tikal. What is significant in both instances is that two individuals are represented in dif- ferent styles on the same work in order to indicate the ethnic groups to which they belong. This is very unusual in the history of Western art, and I could not find parallel examples in other cultures of what I am calling style juxtaposition. (I do not, of course, claim to be familiar with all of world art, and I hope that scholars in other fields will add to and modify these statements.) A cursory glance at the art of many parts of the world suggests that in almost all sit- uations of culture contact, some effort is made to blend styles and create visual har- mony rather than to exaggerate differences. When the artists of Darius designed the sculptures of Persepolis, the vastness of the Persian empire was represented by tribute bearers from all corners of the realm, whose 2O PASZTORY</page><page sequence="8">9.

The em- pire is visually evoked by the homogeneity of the Achaemenid style, and the minor differences of its subject peoples are rele- gated to details. In the metaphor of lan- PASZTORY 21</page><page sequence="9">12. Gentile Bellini, Mahomet II, oil, 70 x 50 {27lA x igVs) National Gallery, London guage, we could say the Persepolis reliefs proclaim that all of Persia speaks the same language, although its dialects are different. By contrast, the Bazan Slab represents a sit- uation in which two languages of equal stature confront one another. So far my discussion has focused on pa- trons and social contexts rather than the artist. There are few examples of artists working in both their home style and the style of an alien group, although with re- cent studies the list is growing. An example familiar to me is Gentile Bellini's portrait of a Turkish artist in the style of a Turkish miniature in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston. Gentile Bellini, a Venetian, spent several months between 1479 and 1480 at the court of Mohammed II in Istanbul.8 The sultan had asked for a portrait painter because he was enamored of Venetian art, and this cul- tural mission took place after the signing of a peace treaty between Venice and the sultan. Among works Bellini painted in his home style for the sultan is a royal portrait in oil, now in London (fig. 12). More un- usual, however, is the little miniature, painted on parchment with pen and gouache, that looks surprisingly like a work of ori- ental art (fig. 13). We do not know what this means in the sense of the interaction be- tween the two artists. Is it Gentile saying: "I can work just as well in your style!"? Is it Gentile's appreciation of Turkish art or of his friendship with this particular artist? The answers to these questions may lie either in the personal realm - the relation- ship between artists - or in the aesthetic realm - the play with different stylistic tra- ditions for its own sake. Clearly the sultan did not commission Gentile Bellini to work in the Turkish style - the mere notion is absurd. Another possible example of style jux- taposition in the work of a European artist is a drawing by Durer in which a Venetian and Nuremberg costume are compared (fig. 14).9 Erwin Panofsky described this drawing in terms of the concept of style opposition that was then current in art his- torical thinking: . . . in one truly remarkable drawing he illus- trated the fundamental difference between the Southern and Northern fashion by repre- senting a Ventian gentildonna side by side with a Nuinberg Hausfrau. Everything wide and loose in the Italian dress is narrow and tight in the German one, the bodice as well as the sleeves and the shoes. The Venetian skirt is cut on what may be called architec- tural lines; the figure seems to rise from a solid horizontal base, and the simple parallel folds give an effect not unlike that of a fluted column. The German skirt is arranged so as to taper from the waist downward. The Ital- ian costume accentuates the hortizontals (note the belt and the very form of the neck- lace), uncovers the shoulder joints and em- phasizes the elbows by little puffs.

Strauss, The Complete Drawings of Albrecht Durer I (New York, 1974), 273 man costume does precisely the opposite. The very idea of this juxtaposition might have been suggested by Heinhch Wolfflin. Diirer contrasted the two figures as the modern art historian would contrast a Renaissance pa- lazzo with a Late Gothic town house; there is in fact another Diirer sketch, probably made on the occasion of his second trip to Venice (1582), where an analogous comparison is drawn between the ground plan of two cen- tral-plan buildings, one medieval and the other Leonardesque. In sum the costumes are interpreted not only as curiosities, but also as documents of style.10 Like the Gentile Bellini portrait of a Turkish artist, the Diirer drawing is a per- sonal sketch and not a commission. It tells us a great deal about Diirer's psychology both as an artist and as an individual. Panofsky has shown that Diirer was the earliest German artist to take a trip to Italy and to try to bring Italian Renaissance styles and theories of art, which he saw as supe- rior, to the north. His friends were aristo- crats and intellectuals, and he became an artist in the southern tradition of human- ists rather than in the northern tradition of craftsmen. The comparison in the drawing PASZTORY 23</page><page sequence="11">is therefore skewed; the Venetian gentil- donna is meant to be superior and histor- ically more modern than the Nuremberg hausfrau. Panofsky does not ask whether there is anything special in the political situation of Europe that results in such communications between artists and com- parisons of styles. I find it striking that both Gentile Bellini and Albrecht Diirer are nearly contemporary, that Diirer stayed in Gio- vanni Bellini's house in Venice and copied paintings by Gentile Bellini, including one entitled "Turks/711 and that Venice had especially close connections with a non- European culture and had, too/a highly de- veloped sense both of itself and of that Other. Neither does Panofsky ask why Diirer in particular should have been so interested in the issue of ethnic and cultural identity and comparison,- he merely lets it go as a "curiosity." What is unusual about the Mesoameri- can works of art in which style juxtaposi- tion is present is that they are public rather than private statements, and represent po- litically sanctioned attitudes toward style. The significance of style juxtaposition for Mesoamerica and for the study of style will be clarified by a brief look at Mesoamerica. Since most of the history of Mesoamerica is archaeological, we are used to speaking of its various cultures, some of which have been given ethnic names, such as Maya or Aztec,- but for many cultures, such as Teo- tihuacan, the ethnic identity is not known. In terms of political organization most of the cultures in Mesoamerica were states, although we often have little detail about them. I shall use the term polity to refer to these states. Mesoamerica is comparable to Europe in that it consisted of diverse ethnic groups speaking different languages and living in politically separate and independent states (fig. 15). Even the largest empire we know, that of the Aztecs, never conquered and controlled more than two-thirds of Meso- america, and sl( no time was the whole area politically unified (fig. 16). This is not un- like the situation in Europe, with Hitlers and Napoleons trying to unify it on occa- sion, but through most of its history the area has consisted of highly interactive but independent countries. 24 PASZTORY 15- Map of Mesoamerica and its culture areas From Miguel Covarrubias, Indian Art of Mexico and Central America (Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. ©, New York, 1957), 2 16. Map of postclassic Meso- america and the Aztec empire From Muriel P. Weaver, The Aztecs, Maya, and Their Predecessors (New York, 1972), 198</page><page sequence="12">The Aztec state became a conquest em- pire and tried to control a large part of Mesoamerica. This empire, however, was not a territorial empire, but what has been called a hegemonic empire.12 Conquered territories outside the capital and heartland were allowed to retain their local rulers and customs, and in most cases Aztec colonists did not move in and settle among them. Conquered areas were expected to send tribute to their overlords, who depended on the raw materials, manufactured goods, or labor skills the areas possessed. Provinces frequently rebelled by not sending the agreed tribute, and the Aztec empire was con- stantly at war putting down rebellions. This is very different from the European concept of empire in which territory is overtaken, colonies are settled, languages may be changed, and an attempt made by the con- queror to impose his art and culture on the conquered. In the extreme case of Hitler, the conqueror sought to control even biology. Because the Aztec empire was conquered by the Spanish in 152 1, only about 150 years after its inception, it is difficult to know whether a more integrated imperial struc- ture might have developed in time. It has been suggested that an integrated state did not develop in Mesoamerica due to physical constraints, such as the lack of draft ani- mals for transport, essential both for com- merce and war. The formation of an inte- grated state was also hampered by the nature of the Mesoamerican world view that saw the cosmos in a constant, ineluctable state of flux between creation and destruction. Whether the nature of Mesoamerican states and cultures was determined by material conditions or ideology is a complex ques- tion I shall not try to consider here. I am suggesting that the material and ideological contexts of Mesoamerica made unlikely the visualization of a stable, universal state. The history of Mesoamerica is divided into three periods: the preclassic period from 1 500 B.C. to a.d. 300, the classic period from a.d. 300 to 900, and the postclassic period from 900 to the Spanish conquest in 1521. The empire of the Aztecs existed during the latter half of the postclassic period. In the classic period, Mesoamerica did not have a single major empire like that of the Aztecs. The largest and most influential state was that of Teotihuacan in central Mexico, about fifty kilometers northeast of Mexico City. Other important states were Monte Alban in Oaxaca, El Tajin in Vera- cruz, and Kaminaljuyu in the Guatemala highlands. The Maya of Yucatan, Guate- mala, and Honduras lived in city-states, the most important of which included Tikal, Palenque, Piedras Negras, Copan, Uxmal, Dzibilchaltun, and Chichen Itza (fig. 15). Like Europe, Mesoamerica formed its own "known world" in Fernand Braudel's sense of the term, through shared customs and institutions. The states were associated with each other through long-distance trade in necessary items such as obsidian and grind- ing stones, as well as in luxury goods such as exotic feathers, shells, and greenstone. The elites of the different states frequently intermarried and were related by shifting alliances and wars. Although each state had its own customs, they all shared a similar calendar, religion, and world view. This is comparable to Christianity in Europe, which was a unifying force despite the great dif- ferences between Catholics and Protes- tants. The Maya area might be comparable to Renaissance Italy in comprising an area in which a single language and culture were widely shared, although it was politically fragmented into separate city-states. Teo- tihuacan, Monte Alban, and El Tajin were larger polities comparable to the emerging nation-states in the Renaissance, such as England or France, in each of which there was a different spoken language and a dif- ferent sense of ethnic identity. George Kubler discussed the character- istic architectural profile associated with each of the major polities in classic Meso- america (fig. 17).13 He suggested that these were similar to the classical orders, and if we think of the orders as having different origins, rather than different symbolic functions, that is a good parallel. However, the architectural profiles in Mesoamerica never served different purposes at the same site, and they were more rigidly polity- related than the Greco-Roman orders. Until the classic period, pyramid profiles con- sisted of simple vertical or sloping sides. In the classic period each platform stage was articulated into two or more segments, con- sisting of vertical, horizontal, and diagonal PASZTORY 25</page><page sequence="13">17- Comparison of Mesoameri- can architectural profiles From George Kubler, "Iconographic Aspects of Architectural Profiles at Teotihuacan in Mesoamerica," in The Iconography of Middle American Sculpture (New York, 1973), 34 1 8.

At Monte Alban the tablero consists of overhanging square panels, emphasized 26 PASZTORY</page><page sequence="14">19- Monte Alban, Oaxaca, Mexico, temple model, classic period Museo Nacional de Antropologia, Mexico City.

In Veracruz at El Tajin, a flaring cornice, re- versing the line of the talud, is added on the tablero (fig. 20). Among the Maya there is variability from site to site, but in general a sloping talud usually has other sloping elements such as apron moldings on top of it, avoiding the more dramatic contrast of a tablero (fig. 21). The presence of inset corners and continuous sloping lines em- phasizes the vertical forms. The greatest contrast in style is between Teotihuacan and the Maya. For hundreds of years these profiles were characteristic of important structures in these areas, and they appear to have been visual symbols of identity and belonging, like the dress of Guatemalan villagers to- day. So clear are these conventions that a building in an alien style at a given site is generally believed to represent a foreign conquest or an interaction of similar mag- nitude. An example is the small shrine with a characteristic Veracruz profile at the Maya site of Tikal, which stands out as highly unusual (fig. 22). Of particular interest is that such artic- ulated profiles were unknown in the pre- classic period and were much less devel- oped in the postclassic era. Both in preclassic and postclassic periods platforms generally had simple sloping stages without elaborate articulation, although Aztec temples have a characteristic balustrade form. This sug- gests that in the classic period, for some reason, ethnic and polity differences were so important that identifying symbolism evolved even in architecture. In other words, architectural profiles in Mesoamerica ap- pear to have been symbolic of polity iden- tity in some periods, but not all, suggesting that the visualization of group identity is not always equally important in societies and that its presence needs explanation. It is notable that in Mesoamerica of the classic period a large number of coexisting, separate, ethnic groups came into intensive and extensive contact with one another. Despite the intensive contact, the main- tenance of cultural differences appears to have been a major concern.

The origin of a person is depicted not just in dress but in the style of the entire figure.

Author photograph as "man" into the Bazan Slab. Man is inseparable from "Teotihuacan man" or "Monte Alban man." In classic Meso- america there is an unusually strong sense of the difference between the self and the other, which is seen as being practically insurmountable. Like the maiden and the suitor in the cartoon, marriage is not pos- sible because the figures inhabit different visual worlds. Mesoamerica in the classic period therefore appears to have considered ethnic units as basic and immutable and to have created rigid barriers in order to main- tain them. In this view, style was insepa- rable from society, politics, and probably even linguistic or biological roots. Further proof of the association of style and ethnic identity in Mesoamerica are two conquest monuments in alien styles. The style of the Maya city-state of Tonina is characterized by an unusual emphasis on three-dimensional forms (fig. 23). It was therefore surprising to find in the Tonina excavations a monument in the low-relief style of Palenque (fig. 24). I4 Recent break- throughs in the decipherment of Maya hier- oglyphic writing have made it possible to identify these personages. The Palenque style relief at Tonina represents the Palenque ruler Kan Xul taken prisoner at Tonina and probably sacrificed there. Tonina com- memorated the coup by a relief in which the Palenque ruler was represented in his home style. We do not know how this was done: a Tonina artist may have imitated Palenque style, or a Palenque artist may have been made to carve the relief as an added humiliation. I find the second pos- sibility intriguing. Sixteenth-century sources PASZTORY 29</page><page sequence="17">24. Tonina, Chiapas, Mexico, Monument 22, drawing in Palenque style, classic period From P.

From Linda Schele and Mary Miller, The Blood of Kings (Fort Worth and New York, 1986), 219 tell us that when the Aztecs defeated a pol- ity they often asked the conquered people to build roads and causeways or other proj- ects as a form of tribute. Sometimes they did this if the polity was well known for its building crafts.15 Linda Schele and Mary Miller have sug- gested that Piedras Negras Stela 12 is very likely a monument carved by a Pomona artist to represent the Piedras Negras con- quest of Pomona (fig. 25 ).16 They cite as evidence the unusually individualized and even sympathetic portrayal of the victims bound by ropes (fig. 26). It would seem that in Mesoamerica it was possible to capture not only prisoners but also styles. Further, it would seem that at this time there was no concept of stylistic assimilation or of a "melting pot/' just as there was no concept of a territorial empire. Alien groups may have been conquered and made to send trib- ute, and their leaders may have been killed and sacrificed, but there was no attempt to destroy the land, culture, or style of the Other either by incorporation or annihila- tion. Despite all the warfare and the sac- rifice of individuals, the right of the Other to exist as a group was continuously vali- dated and maintained. We might even say that erecting a Palenque-style conquest monument at Tonina was a reaffirmation of the continued separate existence of Pal- enque. Palenque was not wiped out visu- ally,- it was humiliated but maintained with the understanding that at some future time it might be victorious over Tonina. Until recently, the Palenque-style relief at Tonina would have been attributed to the "influence" of Palenque, based on a European-derived art history in which style had been seen as advancing aggressively on its own like a conquering army. Michael Baxandall has shown that this view re- verses actual events, since the influenced party is in fact the active agent. He dem- onstrates the complexity and richness of this process by the words available to de- scribe it: ". . . draw on, resort to, avail one- self of, appropriate from, have recourse to, adapt, misunderstand, refer to, pick up, take on, engage with, react to, quote, differen- tiate oneself from, assimilate oneself to, align oneself with, copy, address, paraphrase, ab- sorb, make a variation on, revive, continue, 3O PASZTORY</page><page sequence="18">26.

Baxandall's language is in- corporative in the traditon of European art history. Art and theories of art are related to larger social and political contexts, and I would like to illustrate the Mesoamerican pre- occupation with the maintenance of the Other, as this is seen in art and style, with the example of an Aztec custom. The con- cept of the maintenance of the Other goes to the extreme of preserving the enemy; it can be seen in one of the Aztec institutions most incomprehensible to the Western mind: "flowery war." According to six- teenth-century histories, this institution was begun under Motecuhzoma I when the Az- tec empire was so large and consolidated that wars were fought far from home. Since one of the aims of war was to bring victims home for ritual sacrifice, the lack of warfare near home created a problem. This was solved by a mutual agreement with the pol- ity of Tlaxcala, never conquered but close to the capital, to hold periodic ritual wars. Battles were declared at an appointed place so both sides could take prisoners. These wars were considered good training ground for soldiers, but clearly this aspect was sec- ondary. Although the sixteenth-century texts suggest that the Aztecs invented the practice, this is historical fiction. There is evidence that the practice existed earlier among the Chalca, and it very likely existed in different forms at different times and places.18 In the flowery war it was more important to capture victims to sacrifice than to conquer and control an alien group and territory. Indeed, there was a positive commitment to the preservation of differ- ent ethnic groups, since the victim needed to come from an alien group. We still do not know what mechanisms and institutions in classic Mesoamerica al- lowed for the reasonably stable period of six hundred years in which these highly individual and distinctive cultures flour- ished with a maximum of interaction with- out the breakdown of barriers. I would like to suggest that some of the interaction be- tween groups may have been highly orga- nized and perhaps ritualized. The exten- siveness of the interaction was, in my view, a critical aspect of this period. The ex- change of trade, ideas, and perhaps even personnel is evident everywhere and seems to account for the signs of wealth and flo- rescence. This exchange did not occur with- out war, but it was limited and neither dras- tically changed the status quo nor altered the territorial situation. I have long been intrigued by the Meso- american ball game, and wondered what political and economic circumstances fos- tered the development of this institution. Although this game was played throughout Mesoamerican history, from the point of view of related architecture and sculpture, it was most important in the classic pe- riod.19 At that time most sites had at least PASZTORY 31</page><page sequence="19">27. Jaina style, Mexico, ball player figurines, classic period Museo Nacional de Antropologia, Mexico City one masonry ball court, and some had nine or more. Moreover, ball players were fre- quently represented on monumental sculp- ture as well as on pottery and figurines (fig. 27). The characteristic thick padding they wear and their special playing postures make them easily recognizable. The game, a team sport, was played with a solid rubber ball hit by the hips, knees or elbows. A number of reliefs indicate that the ball game was important ritually and carried a sacrificial aspect. Ball players are shown decapitated, sometimes with flowering vines emerging from their necks, as though some symbol- ism of cosmic regeneration were suggested by the game (fig. 28). Frequently the two teams shown on the reliefs represent dif- ferent ethnic types and costumes, although in this example they are not in different styles (figs. 29, 30). On this Chichen Itza relief, a team with mosaic collars faces a team with shell necklaces. The teams have sometimes been said to represent ethnic groups; historical events, such as a conflict between the Maya and the Toltec;20 or rit- ual groups divided into teams representing the cosmic forces of light and dark.21 1 will not try to determine whether these players 32 PASZTORY represent certain ethnic groups or ritual performers. But it is relevant that through ethnic dress the two teams are visualized as separate and distinct. We know the ritual and mythic aspects of the ball game from the Popol Vuh, a Quiche Maya book from the colonial pe- riod.22 The story of the ball game follows immediately the description of the creation of the world, and is therefore placed in a privileged context. Two brothers, the hero twins of the story, play ball on the surface of the earth, angering the lords of the un- derworld who envy their playing gear. The lords invite them to play ball in the un- derworld, planning to kill them. Before the ball game, the twins must stand various trials, each of which they lose, and after finally losing the game, they are decapi- tated. The head of one brother is placed on a calabash tree, and the tree miraculously bursts into fruit. A maiden of the under- world passes by and becomes pregnant from the spittle of the skull. When the lords of the underworld discover her pregnancy, they are extremely angry and banish her. She goes up to the world and resides with the old grandmother of the original twins until</page><page sequence="20">28.

They too play ball and are invited into the un- derworld by the lords of death, but this time they have various magic tricks and succeed at all the impossible trials. Finally, they show the lords of death that they are mas- ters over life and death when one hero cuts up the other and brings him back to life. The lords of death ask that the same be done to them, too, and of course the twins do not bring them back to life. The story ends with the hero twins ascending into the sky and becoming the sun and the moon. It is accepted that this Maya version of the harrowing of hell is a cosmic parable with two parallel stories: the first ball game in which the lords of death are victorious and the second in which the lords of life - the sun and the moon - are victorious. In each, victory is at the expense of the other, who dies. These zero-sum games are con- sistent with the widespread Mesoamerican belief that all cosmic forces are cyclical: the sun is defeated by the forces of darkness when it enters the earth at sunset in the west, and the forces of darkness are defeated by the sun reborn every morning in the east. Each alternation represents a birth and a death. Although the story has a happy end- ing, the implication of course is that this cycle never ends. A second aspect of the myth is the blooming of the tree in the underworld when the decapitated head is placed on it, expressing the necessity of the first deaths: the sacrificial death of the heroes brings forth the resurgence of nature and the rebirth of the forces of light. It is very likely that some ritual games ended with sacrificing a member of the los- ing team, and that the game was a reen- actment of the myth with the players rep- resenting the forces of light and darkness. The winners and losers were probably thought to have been selected by the gods and therefore were preordained. The game could have been played by different teams in the home city, but I think it possible that in the classic period games might have been played between ethnic groups as well. The representation of different ethnic associa- tions on the reliefs suggests this much. Some sources in the sixteenth century indicate that in certain situations instead of fighting 34 PASZTORY a war to determine who pays tribute to whom, a ball game was played. Rulers are shown confronting each other within a ball court in a scene in the Codex Nuttall*3 I am suggesting that the ritual ball game served to channel hostile ethnic competi- tiveness, in order to obtain sacrificial vic- tims from alien ethnic groups, while at the same time fostering interaction, trade, and other activities concurrently with the games. The ball game may have been one of several ritualized mechanisms for interaction and exchange among ethnic groups in Meso- america that nonetheless maintained sep- aration and even hostility. Writing about the modern Maya villagers of Chiapas in Mexico, Henning Siverts stated that their cultural differences are "over- communicated/7 a term that is apt for clas- sic Mesoamerica.24 This is evident in the presence of clearly defined polity styles and architectural orders that are unique to cer- tain groups. Unusual representations, such as style juxtapositions and the use of an alien style to represent conquered individ- uals, indicate that style is not considered a "manner" superimposed on things and traveling separately on its own, but part of the essential nature and reality of things. Mesoamerican art is not simply different from Western European art, but it devel- oped in the context of a different under- standing of style. There is a possibility that the uses and meanings of style as a whole differ greatly between groups and at differ- ent times in the same group. Similarly, our own concepts of style as art historians and archaeologists are part of a specific Euro- pean tradition of understanding the nature of style. The practice and theory of style therefore exist together and reinforce one another. When Paul Wingert taught African art from the perspective of style area in a way that was so handy for students, that concept was not intrinsic to the material, but was an artifact of European thought de- rived from the notion of folk and national styles characteristic of European culture. Future art historians interested in this sub- ject may find significant differences be- tween the theory and behavior of styles in various parts of the world. Such research might add new dimensions to art history as a discipline.</page><page sequence="22">It is not my purpose here to describe our own concepts or style except by way of brief illustration. As Westerners, we tend to value highly distinct and formalized styles and to feel uncomfortable with indefinite ones. The styles of the non- Western world have been defined from this perspective as "tribal" and "cultural" styles. Rather than seeing these as normal to societies, such group styles need to be regarded as specific reactions to certain circumstances that have practical economic and political dimensions. "Tribes" and "chiefdoms" and the making of ethnic maps were largely the creation of colonial- ist administrators for the purposes of po- litical and economic control. In effect, these colonial governments created clear bound- aries whether they existed or not, thereby creating a situation in which some groups, previously not clearly defined, could, if they wished, nurture and emphasize their own tribal identity through art and ritual. Other tribes, upon being separated into different European colonies, and speaking different European languages, also began a process of cultural differentiation and separation. On the basis of the material remains dis- covered through archaeological excavation, Mesoamerica appears to have had a more rigidly defined sense of stylistic boundary than many other parts of the world, in- cluding Western Europe. On the basis of this rather briefly sketched material, I would like to conclude with a few hypotheses: Ethnic or polity styles emerge primarily as a way of dealing with others, and their main purpose is the creation of difference. The socio-political conditions essential for them is the close proximity of other inde- pendent groups with whom there is inter- action that probably includes competition and hostility. This condition can exist on the tribal village level, as in many areas of Africa; on the peasant folk level, as in the Guatemala highlands,- on the state level as in Mesoamerica; and on the level of the nation-state. Such group styles are therefore not linked to any developmental stage of culture, such as folk or tribal cultures, but are linked to the patterns of interaction between centers among the cultures. For example, in pre- classic Mesoamerica, when states and chiefdoms were few and just emerging, pol- ity styles were not highly developed. In fact, many of the high-status items in different centers were similar, suggesting that the elite were sharing objects for ritual and prestige.25 Group styles are clearer in the pottery and figurines on the village level, suggesting that interaction between vil- lages was highly structured and defined. By a.d. 300, ethnic styles existed on the level of state polities. Ethnicity has been of great intellectual interest in the last twenty years. In 1955 Nikolaus Pevsner still attributed the "Eng- lishness of English art" to language and the misty weather, otherwise accepting the im- mutability of national style and character.26 It has now become fashionable to talk about the invention of traditions everyone once felt were buried in antiquity. Hugh Trevor- Roper's analysis of the Scottish tartans widely believed to be clan symbols is a very fine example of such intellectual unmask- ing.27 He has shown that the clan tartans were introduced by an English industrialist and were later elaborated into named de- signs by textile firms competing for busi- ness. The tartans were associated with spu- rious texts about the antiquity of the highland Scot tradition by various individ- uals. Some of these individuals always knew that the antiquity of the tartans was bogus, while others involved in the creation of the myth believed it themselves. What Hugh Trevor-Roper does not ask is why the clan tartans became so popular, since correct in- formation was always available and many voices were raised against the collective tartan-"hallucination." Although Scotland is not my story here, it is evident that for various economic and political reasons Scotland needed an ideology and visual in- dicators of ethnic identity so much that even the spurious would do. Siverts has shown in the case of the Indians of Chiapas that the nature of ethnic symbols may change and may even incorporate alien ele- ments. The Chamula use as Indian a cos- tume derived from a French grenadier's uni- form introduced under Maximilian in 1 862.28 Some of the most perceptive work on eth- nicity and society has been undertaken by anthropologists and sociologists. Fredrik Barth has shown that "ethnic distinctions PASZTORY 35</page><page sequence="23">do not depend on an absence of mobility, contact, and information/7 and he consid- ers simplistic the view that geographical and social isolation have been critical in sustaining cultural diversity. Instead, he suggests that ethnicity is intentionally cre- ated despite contact between groups. He recommends focusing on the boundaries that separate groups, through which a steady stream of contact is structured in such a way that the ethnic identity of both sides is preserved. Ethnicity for Barth means the maintenance of boundaries; and he sug- gests that the ethnic boundary defines a group rather than the cultural stuff it encloses.29 Abner Cohen has analyzed the ways in which Hausa traders in West African cities maintained their ethnicity.30 In brief, his study suggests that the development of clear ethnic identity and culture was of great eco- nomic and practical value for the Hausa living within the ethnically very different Yoruba towns. In the creation of ethnicity he singles out the creation of distinctive- ness through art and myth, a shared ide- ology, and patterns of communication, au- thority, and discipline. He supports Barth's view that ethnicity is not static once it is achieved, but survives only if individuals are constantly making personal commit- ments to it throughout their lives.31 The following are my hypotheses about the nature of the relationship between art and ethnicity: Cultural Dimensions of Ethnic Art Styles All peoples and cultures do not automati- cally evolve ethnic styles. Such styles emerge only when external articulation of ethnic identity is necessary for a variety of polit- ical and economic reasons. Although in- formation is often lacking or may not be recoverable, various lines of evidence have shown that ethnicity in art and ideology is tightly related to practical and material as- pects of society, and is a strategy for survival. Formal Aspects of Visual Identity; Articulation and Standardization; the Creation of a Brand Image Visual forms are essential in the realization of ethnic identity both on political and per- 36 PASZTORY sonal levels. In the arts the forms may in- clude anything from architecture to dress. Characteristically, visual distinctions are made through articulation - the manipu- lation of forms so they result in distinct, clear units, easily remembered, recognized, and repeated - and through their repetition, once the forms have become standardized. They may be the result of increasing com- plexity, or of the simplification of forms. Good examples are the pyramid profiles in Mesoamerica or the various Guatemalan weaving patterns. The Overt Meaning Given to New Forms - a Mythical Historic Identity As has been mentioned briefly, the actual forms used to create ethnic identity may be borrowed or historically bogus, as in the case of the Scottish tartans, which in no way lessens their effectiveness. Such forms, whether architectural orders or patterns, are associated with a mythology of meanings. The foremost of these meanings concerns antiquity. The forms used are said to be ancient, ancestral, and proper, and are meant to embody the identity of the group from time immemorial. This is a form of vali- dation through history. The Covert Meanings of Ethnic Styles - Competition and Difference While the articulated forms ostensibly are looking backward to an authentic past, co- vertly they are also looking to a present occupied by other ethnic groups or polities similarly creating images of themselves and trying to be distinct from their neighbors. These social relations are often competitive and hostile; and many ways of showing ethnic distinctness are oppositions: curves oppose straight lines, verticals oppose hor- izontals, life forms oppose geometries, three- dimensionality opposes two-dimensional- ity. Such patterns of oppositions can be found on a variety of levels from the national to the individual, and are as true of the Bazan Slab as of the Diirer drawing.</page><page sequence="24">Ethnic Art Styles Result from Interaction, Not Isolation Cultural and ethnic art styles as defined above are the physical representations of the complex boundary between a polity and its neighbors. The talud tablero of Teoti- huacan represents not Teotihuacan, but Teotihuacan in relation to its past and its contemporary neighbors in Oaxaca, Vera- cruz and Guatemala. Isolated peoples, whether New Guinea highlanders or Io- wans, are not known for their highly de- veloped ethnic styles. Theoretical Concepts of Style Although a few generalizations can be made about ethnic styles at present, the issue is complicated by the fact that different his- torical traditions have different under- standings of style in general; styles, there- fore, do not behave in the same way from culture to culture. Because of the high de- velopment of European art history, its the- oretical models hold a privileged position and are generally believed to be universal. The European concept or style, including the concept of influence or borrowing and the gradual annihilation of old styles by newer styles, is an evolutionary paradigm that may be related to European patterns of politics, war, and a theory of history. If there are any universal patterns and func- tions of stylistic behavior in art, these are yet to be discovered. A comparative anal- ysis of the practice and theory of style in various other cultures might provide the factual information on which such a theory could be based. I hope that this study of ethnicity in Mesoamerican art is a step in that direction. PASZTORY 37</page><page sequence="25">NOTES i. Paul S.
