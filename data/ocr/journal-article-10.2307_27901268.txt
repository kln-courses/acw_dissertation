<plain_text><page sequence="1">VALUE AND EVALUATION OF BEAUTY Pure or general aesthetics is based on two problems: First, we ask what we mean by beauty. This question leads to an analysis of what appears as beautiful in our aesthetic experience. Philosophy of beauty is not, however, exhausted by such an analysis. The essential philosophical question al ways is not "What is the thing?" but rather what is the right, the value, the "idea" of the thing. And if the "thing" should itself turn out to be a value or idea, then the philosophical question becomes the question as to the value of this value. This involves a comparison with other values, whereby the value in question is understood in its relative position and opposition. It thus becomes a legitimate member of a universe to whose constitution it belongs. If we call the first, the phenomenological, part of aes thetics, analysis, we may call this second essentially philo sophical part the dialectic of beauty. The first ought to contain what an artist would have to say were he to give an account of the nature of beauty instead of actualizing it in many artistic expressions; the second should imply what beauty is, not only for the philosophizing artist but for the philosopher as such, for whom beauty can only be an aspect of a more significant organism, the absolute whole, intelligible or present only as a whole of irreducible opposites in dialectical thought.</page><page sequence="2">VALUE AND EVALUATION OF BEAUTY 53 I Stars and skies, atmosphere and oceans, dead and living things, surfaces and lines, events, characters, actions, ideas may appear as beautiful, whether in art or in nature. Thus beauty is felt as universal, or all-inclusive. But all these things can also be regarded apart from their being beautiful. They are real, as problems of scien tific investigation and of practical conduct. Beauty super venes upon them. It is possible to separate it in thought. We are entitled, therefore, to call it "form" or "idea" of things which are occasions or carriers of its appearance. This distinction between ideal aesthetic form and that on which it supervenes is made more easily in nature than in works of art. The beautiful sight of the starry heaven is like a loose cloak, readily thrown off so that the physical machinery appears to the calculating mind of an astrono mer or physicist. Works of art, on the other hand, are intended to be beautiful; they entreat you to forget their psycho-physical scaffolding in space and time. In art, the material becomes negligible. The colours of a picture can be scratched away, the words of a poem can be ordered alphabetically; the colours retain their physical being and their intrinsic order in a range of hues, the words their practical meanings as parts of speech, but their aesthetic reality residing in the "form" has departed. Music or drama may be performed in many places, by many organs, before many audiences, but its beauty remains ideally the same, recognizable as this and no other. Contrariwise, one instrument may convey widely different beauties. Beauty is never identical with the empirical occasion of our being aware of it. Our result so far is that beauty is universal "form" or idea. As such, it appears upon the analysis of our aesthetic</page><page sequence="3">54 THE MONIST experience. To the artist, though, beauty does not appear in thought but in a unique material. We have, then, to ask further what this peculiar synthesis of idea and ex perience-the work of art-is, or how things are trans figured when apprehended as beautiful. Since Kant discovered the autonomy of aesthetics, the answer to this question has become generally agreed upon : Things are aesthetically apprehended when they are felt as delightful, not necessarily when we feel delight. Things are aesthetically delightful when in being with them we have no desire to alter them or to alter ourselves, when the distance between them and ourselves is forgotten, when we are able to live our lives in something else, though being aware at the same time that this is only seemingly a real life-this something else may be a shad ow, a surface, a symbol, a dead and otherwise meaningless matter. Beauty as form of experience eliminates all de mands. Things delight us aesthetically when they absorb us, when all our wanting and demanding is brought to a stop because all that we might want to be seems to be presently fulfilled in the illusion of living an unreal life in the "other," which is or remains not an "other" but be comes my "alter ego." Further, we can be with things without wishing to alter them or ourselves, we can be aesthetically delighted, in short, if we are allowed to see them steadily and see them whole. Beauty "peels off," isolates the pure surface of things in the interest of wholeness and self-sufficiency. It "arrests" appearances, in order to present them to us as intrinsically sufficient and significant. "Things" in their aesthetic form thus seem to be more real, seem to give us a self-sufficient, total world, because they are absolutely derealized ; their beauty means that we take them as if they</page><page sequence="4">VALUE AND EVALUATION OF BEAUTY 55 were wholes, as if their appearance, their surface, were their complete and absolute being. Otherwise they would lure us on and on, as real problems and tasks of life do. (The artist, therefore, is the champion of immediacy: if the physicist calls colours anthropomorphic designations for something else, the painter would have to answer that the scientist has abandoned the obvious, satisfactory, de lightful being of real colours for the sake of superadded, deforming, pale notions like "energy-quanta" and "wave lengths.") Art emphasizes the self-sufficiency of its seeming world by such devices as frames and pedestals, which separate it from the world of busy commonsense. Art is a ladder by which we climb out of our ordinary spheres into that ap pearing festive "state of mind" where we are ready to re ceive beauty. Art is realization of beauty. We can be together with things'without desire to alter them or ourselves if there is no distinction between the "I" and the "Other," subject and object. Beauty is the pos sibility of this oblivion. We call it aesthetic unity. Where as in logic dr in ethics unity remains a critical idea, a norm or standard of criticism, a task never actually fulfilled, in aesthetic experience unity becomes an accomplished pres ent, fulfilled without ceasing to be idea. A thing is ex perienced as beautiful if it shows a thoroughgoing con nection of all its parts on its very surface. In a good poem every word has an intimate and necessary connection with all the other words. Beautiful things have style, an indi viduality convincing and ideally necessary. Nothing can be omitted and nothing added. They are like living organ isms, inexact and crowded with interdependent functions. But that is only an analogy. Biological units are not really self-sufficient wholes. They lack that overwhelming sense</page><page sequence="5">56 THE MONIST of ideality, inevitableness, and totality which is the sign of genuine aesthetic experience. Aesthetic unity does not necessarily mean a biologically organic unity. An open, broken, transcendental, abstract, anti-Greek, anti-organic style can be beautiful, too. Finally, things are delightful aesthetically when they impart the feeling of security. Things are beautiful beyond danger and doubt. Through their aesthetic form they are saved from becoming entangled in our network of contra dictory thought or in our turmoil of conflicting practical evaluations. Their being exempt from this is their aes thetic form. They give us, while we enjoy them, that blessedness of the Epicurean gods that sometimes and erroneously is described as "escape from reality/' Beauty is just the unconditional affirmation of all that is real as simple and unproblematic presence. Beauty embraces the real unconditionally. But in embracing a conditioned or empirical creature, it also elopes-derealizing it-into a sphere of illusory security and peace. We become painfully aware of beauty being "only" an idea when crude empirical neighbors break through the magic veil of delight and contemplation. The ocean is beautiful when innocent to the spectator, but is not beauti ful to the seasick patient. In a work of art we lose the innocent security of aesthetic form when the author sud denly rushes through the, self-contained sufficiency of his symbolism and begins to use it as a sign signifying some thing that lies behind or beyond itself. Our tranquillity is then,gone: we see mere artificial screens and mutter the damnation of dilettantism, just as we also do if people "use" the presence of beauty in art to intoxicate themselves with their own subjective feelings and associations. These different moments are experienced all at once in</page><page sequence="6">VALUE AND EVALUATION OF BEAUTY 57 aesthetic intuition, and recorded in the one aesthetic judg ment: "This is beautiful." We now come to the difficult problem of aesthetic .con tent. The form of beauty is, strictly speaking, also its content. The idea of beauty makes aesthetic experience possible, and is at the same time that which is experienced. The material qualities, logical object-forms, passions, and life-evaluations remain what they were before they became aesthetically transfigured, namely, pre-aesthetic and prob lematic realities. It seems, however, to make a difference on what sort of world beauty supervenes. On the one hand, the very nature of beauty abhors bargainings ; it is ever whole or not at all. On the other hand, there is the fact of a departmentalization of beauty in the different arts, each of which selects a specific element on which to build its peculiar effects. As a first step toward the solu tion of this dilemma, let us consider a classification of the arts-respectively, of artistic aspects of nature. I think them ordered in a series of three stages: I should place dance and music first. Living individuals ex press themselves directly in temporal orders and rhythms. Music soon extends this movement by means of artificial organs. But the tonal structures, with their intrinsic orders of pitch, intensity, timbre, harmony, melody, and rhythm, remain direct expressions, in that no external ob jects with their spatial exclusiveness and hard limits are interposed. The life of music can be compared with the standpoint of Romanticism, which has drowned the world in relative and constantly moving expressions of an individual self. The easy variability and change of the tones reflect the easy change and infinite variability of feelings. And since feelings are the more or less negative answers of the individual as to how the world has received</page><page sequence="7">58 THE MONIST his activities, music may be said to be the reverberation of the world 'in the immediate and public expression of feeling. The next stage would contain all the spatial arts. Here the sensuous material and its intrinsic order (colour, line, shape, three-dimensional space, and touch-qualities of dif ferent materials) are not directly enjoyed as such, but carry necessary symbolization of things: landscapes, per sons, social purposes. We begin our survey of this spatial group with that aesthetic surface of the world which is dominated by colour. The art of painting is within this objectivistic group next to music. In a picture we get the individual perspective of the painter as the dominant ingredient of the whole. Its value is atmospheric-moody, temperamental-and space is blurred by a range of hues. This art of painting ex presses life in an object-picture but at the same time in its intimacy. The good portrait tells an individual story con centrated in the dominant mood of the moment, just as the picturesque landscape is dominated by the mood of the season and the time of day. Arabesques, tapestry, and and oriental designs are examples of surfaces in which the element of line is prevalent. Linear art, however, dis regards the objectivity of space, plays with it arbitrarily, fantastically. It spreads its scrolls and flourishes in flat planes (the most instructive feature of Chinese "paint ings"), and thus indulges in playful freedom and unco ercive associations. Volumes, areas, and shapes characterize the surface that is the theme of the clear and energetic art of draw ing. This art wakens the sense of essential and lasting foundations and of the elementary relations of life. The lines in this art are not merely movement, as in the case</page><page sequence="8">VALUE AND EVALUATION OF BEAUTY 59 before, but they are teleological-they invite us to march, to take possession of the world. They enclose and encircle, they express that phase of our activity by which we de clare ourselves possessors of a home with definite bounda ries. You get the distinction from the picture view of the world if you compare the classical southern landscape with the temperamental, atmospheric scenery of the north. The acme of this vitalization of space is reached in the plastic arts, especially in sculpture. Whereas logic thinks of bodies as objects by infinite and invisible relations, art makes bodies visible. And it evokes the illusion of be holding in a surface meaning, a human individual in his universal significance. One statue contains a round of different aspects; the subjective perspective is given up because the subject is in the centre of the spectacle. In architecture, the so-called inorganic masses of na ture are compelled to obey the lute of Apollo and to ex hibit their life of pressure and upheaval in the forms of balance, regularity, harmony, or their counterparts, and to echo all explicit purposes of social life from the most prim itive to the highest. The massiveness of architectural material and the wide and elementary purposes of life it expresses, make architecture the art of national epochs. The third stage of our series is literature. Literature is the synthesis of all arts. It has tonal, musical, rhyth mical aspects ; it paints man as a point in the atmospheric diffused life of nature; it portrays him in his moods re flected in his surroundings; it is conceptual, reflective, dream-like and fantastic; it frames stages for plastic heroes; and it builds architectural structures. In it the whole world becomes the garment of symbolic life. It is in literature that this process of retranslating ob jective contents into symbols of life reaches its widest</page><page sequence="9">60 THE MONIST range and likewise achieves its highest possible derealiza tion. Literature, however, buys its advantages at the cost of losing the sensuous presence that is enjoyed by the other arts. But this difference between objectivistic arts and the symbolic art is not radical. As a painted cabbage stands for an indefinite number of vague perceptions and is not a real cabbage, so the poetic word stands for an in definite series of experiences which it vaguely carries like a fringe. (Of course, a "real" cabbage is also aesthetically apprehended as a complex of colour and linear character istics forming a vitally expressive surface.) The different kinds of literature are poles of the entire poetic synthesis. "Lyrics" would be at the musical, di rectly expressive, subjective pole, while "epics" would cor respond to the spatio-objectivistic group. Drama, as the poetry of poetry, uniter direct self-expression with ob jective structure and a three-dimensional tale, its stage being the most revealing symbol of the world. From our hasty survey we now draw a general result : The content of beauty (of aesthetic form) is always the life of the soul embodied in a neutral surface. The surface is a neutral gesture expressing our life, which thus divines its cosmic extension. This fusion of soul and body in a neutral medium is fundamental and common to all aesthetic surfaces. It is the one content corresponding to the one ness of its aesthetic form. Let us now attempt to describe this common character. Life is always individuated : it is nothing but individuation itself. Individual means indivisible; all my feelings, my functions, my interests, my activities belong to me and can not be cut off me, as a thumb can be amputated. The feel ing of pain always remains my pain. Individual also means concentration, relative fixation, organization of activity in</page><page sequence="10">VALUE AND EVALUATION OF BEAUTY 61 a knot or centre. Life exhibits in this relative constancy and endurance an analogy to form, but it differs from the universal, eternal form of beauty in that it constantly undoes what it has begun, that it is in a constant process of liquid ation, dissatisfied re-creation, renewal of its individualized existence. For this reason one may understand the relative character of each epoch in art, which becomes partly alien to living life, as far as its content side is concerned. And one understands that even the most elementary materials, like colours or tones, show this tension of position and counterposition, of rest and unrest, of maintaining them selves and being dissolved in relative contraries. The most simple tune consists of an ascending theme, broken by a contrapuntal descent and a restoration in slightly varied form. And the same inner life makes colours appear as "warm" and "cold" complementaries, as Goethe's theory of colours has so finely shown. We now return to our dilemma : Surfaces thus inter preted are not therefore or thereby aesthetically appre ciated. They are only psychologically understood. If we interpret a landscape as melancholy or poverty-stricken, we interpret a surface as if it were an individual person ality; we take it as a psychological problem. We under stand all life, except our own, as it appears, as it is given to us as individuals. As given, it inevitably appears in a physical surface. Life-as-given-to-an-individual and phys ical surface are synonyms. And we try to reinterpret this given surface into those individuated forms of vital energy or activity which they are in actuality. What, then, makes an appearing surface, which as such is merely a more or less understandable signal or symbol of life, become a beautiful surface? It becomes beautiful when it is absolutely derealized or idealized, when</page><page sequence="11">62 THE MONIST it becomes an innocent essence. The symbol of life be comes beautiful when it becomes the symbol of the form or idea, when all that happens to it which we described as the function of form; when our being together with it is not only a search and a problem but also an unconditional affirmation and delight ; when it is seen not only as a rela tive but also as an ideal whole; when its individuality is not only that of a fluid, relative, anxiously struggling life but is also the perfect individuality of a closed, eternal moment; when its unity is not only an infinite and prob lematic task but also an inevitable presence and certainty. Art, in realizing beauty, derealizes its individual life. II Only briefly and programmatically can I allude to some problems of a dialectical philosophy of beauty. A first possible philosophy of beauty might be called aestheticism. Schelling, in some of his phases, represents this standpoint. It identifies beauty with the whole, and regards nature, subject, or even God as an aspect or moment of beauty. Nature and the life of reason, when not realized in their aesthetic synthesis, are taken as abstractions or mere ap pearances ; aestheticism is pseudo-religious, demanding unconditional reverence for pictures. Its right lies in an adequate account of the ideality of beauty and of its uni versal synthetic function ; the world is an aspect or symbol of it, not vice versa. Its strength lies in its negations, whereby moral, logical, and religious judgments are shown to be non-aesthetic. The aesthetic judgment is not logical. Of two paint ings of the same landscape, it cannot be said that the one is truer than the other, because the logical identity of this</page><page sequence="12">VALUE AND EVALUATION OF BEAUTY 63 landscape is not their object at all. It is the problem of two geographers, who, if contradictory, cannot both be truthful. The object which the painters want to make visi ble and public is not the logical objectivity but the beauty of the landscape. If both achieve that, their paintings are incomparable and equally good. If the aesthetic judgment were logical, beauty would follow as conclusion of given premises ; one might reason a person into accepting beauty without having seen it. Beauty would then be logically communicable, which it is not. The aesthetic judgment is not ethical, either. That would mean that beauty is a subject-value, an obligation and a duty, a standard by which to judge the value of real lives. If this were true, you would have to try Hamlet in a law court and put The Tempest in an insane asylum. Beauty is shocking to the problematic struggle of the practical reason. You may include beauty in an ethical program of education to im prove men. But beauty turns up wherever it wants to : it is not to be systematized, and if you succeeded in your efforts, you would have the ironical result that people so "educated" would turn out to be perfectly indifferent to the seriousness of moral life and would regard it as ma terial of an aesthetic spectacle, in the same way as Goethe considered his love-problems as fine stuff with which to write moving plays. The aesthetic judgment, finally, is not religious, and can not replace religion. If it were re ligious, beauty would have to be experienced as the meta physical ground of our subject-object reality. But such metaphysical burdens are too heavy for it. Without granting the grim realities of nature and of mind, we could never come to need a fusion and a derealization of them in their aesthetic form. Assuming beauty thus as the whole, you cannot turn around and let realities be created by it.</page><page sequence="13">64 THE MONIST Aestheticism lives on an undigested contradiction. If beauty were the whole, then there would not be anything against which it could draw a line of demarcation. The polemic of aestheticism against pre-aesthetic contents and their claims on beauty shows the reality of those contents, a reality which is not eliminated by calling them frag ments, mere appearances, or non-aesthetic beings. Another philosophical possibility would be the attempt to understand beauty in terms of nature, of qualities and forms of objects. This would be an objectivistic aes thetics. If the world of given objects were the whole world, beauty would have to be an object, too, or perhaps a "tertiary quality." If objectivism were ever consistent, it would end by denying beauty altogether. Its aesthetics would consist of a negation. Beauty would be an an thropomorphic expression for something else; its reality would be an endless psychological, physiological, or mathe matical process. To show the impossibility of any ob jectivistic aesthetics would take me too far. The result, which I have to state dogmatically, is that the nature of the object remains problematic and dualistic, and that to know it involves infinite relations and unfinished tasks. In all this it stands in a wholehearted opposition to the phenomenological account of aesthetic experience. Its merit is, therefore, quite negative, but this is its merit: it maintains the antithesis to aestheticism, i.e., that the exist ence of an object-world is a condition for the appearance of beauty. Its strength lies in the analysis of material and of technical and logical preconditions of beauty. It has an eye for the splitting function of its opaque matter, where on the luminous ray of beauty seems to break up into the different surfaces and techniques of the arts. But, na turally, it always loses its aesthetic intention in the pursuit of scientific problems of nature.</page><page sequence="14">VALUE AND EVALUATION OF BEAUTY 65 More important for aesthetics, perhaps because more central than a philosophy of nature, is the philosophy of the subject, or ethics. It speaks about the same reality as objectivism, not in the form of a thought-about-object but, paradoxically enough, in the form of its thinking, strug gling, evaluating activity and actuality. Taken as a whole, it has, naturally, either no place at all for beauty, as the system of Josiah Royce shows, or, if it has, confuses beauty with the struggling competition of different tastes which exhibit the underlying ethical evaluation or the prev alent philosophy of life. Thus, for example, Greek art in all its manifestations, plastic as well as poetic, stands for a naturalistic taste which loves organic forms, empathy; its own aesthetics being summarized in the term "imita tion." Egyptian and Gothic art, on the other hand, ex hibit in the boldness and sharpness of their abstraction a fundamental respect for eternal norms or standards which transcend all individual life and prohibit an easy erotic identification. Tastes are exclusive and dialectical. Beauty is not. The dialectic of the ethical philosophy of life un derlies all arts and determines their contents and their style of expression. But as a philosophy of beauty it is deficient. It misses the innocent, blessed unity of the aesthetic form. In its extreme, this aesthetics would have to consider aesthetic form as a thin and seeming makeup, concealing more than revealing the actual anguishes and decisions of conscience. Metaphysics, finally, or philosophy of religion, must see beauty from the theological point of view as God's idea. There are analogies in the aesthetic and religious at titudes, seducing aesthetics to proclaim a pseudo-religion. Faith finds in God's will, omniscience and omnipresence, an absolute and unproblematic affirmation of all the prob</page><page sequence="15">66 THE MONIST lematic, struggling, dialectical reality. The dialectical struggle of reality finds its peace and its destination in the absolute ground, which has willed or created it as a dialec tical life. The analogy to this religious attitude is found in the aesthetic purification, glorification, or katharsis of all real life, visioned in the innocent mirror of its own derealized pure appearance. Beauty, in theological aesthet ics, would be an analogy of God and His revelation. GUSTAV MUELLER. UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA.</page></plain_text>
