<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES ROMM Wax, Stone, and Promethean Clay: Lucian as Plastic Artist LUCIAN OF SAMOSATA, who seldom abandons a rich metaphor before explor ing every facet of its meaning, frequently defines his literary technique in terms borrowed from the plastic arts, and even envisions himself a sculptor of speeches and dialogues. In one of his prolaliai or "warm-up" speeches,' for example, he addresses a friend who had told him, as the work's title recalls, Prometheus Es in Verbis (1): Did you call me a Prometheus in words? If it was for this reason, friend, that I too work in clay, I acknowledge the comparison and I agree that I am like that god; nor do I mind being called a clay-molder [jlrkotXkaOog], even if my clay is rather trashy stuff, just like that in the gutters, nearly mud in fact. The term "plastic arts" has recently come to include painting, increasingly a three-dimensional medium, as well as sculpture and modeling; but I use the term here in its original sense. This article has benefited from the generous advice of Jack Winkler, Bracht Branham, Carole Newlands, and Ted Morris, and is dedicated to Jack Winkler with deepest gratitude. 1. C. P. Jones (Culture and Society in Lucian [Cambridge, Mass., 1987] 15) has recently suggested that this work may be an "open letter" rather than a speech, judging by its second-person format; but this type of genre variation is characteristic of Lucian (see J. Bompaire, Lucien ecrivain: Imitation et creation [Paris, 1958] 288 n. 5, approved by B. P. Reardon, Courants littgraires grecs des IIe et IIIe siecles apres J.-C. [Paris, 1971] 166 n. 24). On the importance of Lucian's prolaliai in defining his rhetorical techniques, see R. Bracht Branham, "Introducing a Sophist: Lucian's Pro logues," TAPA 115 (1985) 237-43. Branham's more recent work, Unruly Eloquence: Lucian and the Comedy of Traditions (Cambridge, Mass., 1989), was unavailable to me at the time this article was written. ? 1990 BY THE REGENTS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA</page><page sequence="2">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 75 The idea of the literary artist as nTrlkotkai6og, molder of clay, becomes the governing metaphor not only for the rest of this speech, but for many of Lucian's other inquiries into the creative process as well. In such inquiries, moreover, Lucian often draws a contrast between the properties of hard and soft substances in order to illustrate his own "plastic" remodeling of Classical genres, embracing an esthetic based on pliancy and recombination rather than on fixity of outline. Thus, whereas [Longinus] in the De Sublimitate describes his era's imitation of ancient masters as an ajo'trcnTooL;,2 a rigid "stamping" of their dies onto wax or clay, Lucian prefers a more free-handed and original manipulation of his materi als, though he remains wary of the complex problems that his freedom creates. In what follows I shall examine the chief passages in which Luciah uses this sculptural metaphor to define his own compositional technique. In dealing with these passages, however, I shall not be concerned with questions of Lucian's ecphrases, nor of Lucian's art criticism, nor of Lucian's contact with actual artworks still extant in his century.3 Sculpture interests Lucian primarily as a method rather than a form; it becomes a testing ground in his search for a way to work within the formal outlines of Classical literature without becoming impris oned by them. Indeed statuary itself becomes a sort of cultural icon in later antiquity, exemplifying the whole canon of ancient masterworks that cast their long shadows over the age, perhaps because the great Greek statues had by that time been widely reproduced by Roman copyists.4 An investigation of these 2. De Subl. 13.4. For the metaphor contained in &amp;jxoTnj0otLg, see A. von Blumenthal, "T;rog und rcaQp66etylx," Hermes 63 (1928) 391-414. Charles Segal finds in this word a description of "the emotional reaction of the reader" (""Yipog in the De Sublimitate," HSCP 64 [1959] 125 f.) by reading this passage in close conjunction with 13.2. But the process of daOTvoWcootg seems to be more mechanical than emotional. Lucian, for instance, uses the verbal form to describe the process of making a (counterfeit) impression onto sealing wax (Alexander 21; cf. Plato, Theaet. 191D). 3. As Maurice Croiset correctly pointed out, Lucian, unlike many of his fellow sophists, shows little interest in ecphrasis for its own sake, and no particular aptitude as an analytical critic of the arts (Essai sur la vie et les oeuvres de Lucien [Paris, 1882] 266-68, 280-85). For approaches that consider him as such, see A. Le Morvan, "La description artistique chez Lucien," REG 45 (1932) 380-90; Hugo Blumner, Archaologische Studien zu Lucian (Breslau, 1867); Francis G. Allison, Lucian: Satirist and Artist (Boston, 1926) 126-30; Henri Piot, Les procedes litteraires de la Seconde Soph istique chez Lucien: L'ecphrasis (Rennes, 1914); and Bompaire (supra n. 1) chap. 4. All of these scholars, moreover, are inclined to lump sculpture and painting together in discussing Lucian's interest in the visual arts, and thus to overlook his particular focus on the former. Blumner, for example, sets aside the evidence of the Somnium, where Lucian portrays himself as a sculptor manque, so as to focus primarily on "Kenntniss der Technik" rather than "Kenntniss der Kunstge schichte" (1). Later (51-52) he recognizes that the question of technique is indeed central to Lucian's discussions of sculpture, in contradistinction to those of painting, but still gives the subject only summary treatment. 4. The copying of Greek statues was especially widespread during the so-called Greek revival under the emperor Hadrian, the era into which Lucian was born: see M. Bieber, Ancient Copies (New York, 1977) chap. 15; and J. M. C. Toynbee, The Hadrianic School: A Chapter in the History of Greek Art (Cambridge, 1954). Paintings, by contrast, were far less easily moved and reproduced, and proliferated far less widely. Thus, as Blumner points out (supra n. 3: 50 and n. 3; cf. 89-91), Lucian usually adduces examples from paintings in the few cases where he discusses contemporary artists, whereas "die Beispiele der Sculptur sich meistens auf altere, beriihmte Kunstwerke</page><page sequence="3">76 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 recurring sculptural metaphors therefore takes us onto the ground defined by Bompaire, Bowie, Reardon, and others: the question of how heavily the writings of Lucian, and the Second Sophistic in general, rely on ^[ltjotLg or imitation of Classical models, and to what degree this reliance allows for creative originality.5 These questions have been answered in various ways, but the evidence that Lucian himself supplies in his plastic analogue for literary composition has been largely ignored and hence merits extensive consideration. Let us look first at how Lucian "re-forms" one of the most sacred relics be queathed to his era by fifth-century Greek culture, Phidias's Olympian Zeus. This masterwork, the only statue other than the Colossus of Rhodes to be classed among the Seven Wonders of the World, is often adduced by late Greek writers beziehen." The proliferation of Classical sculptures has, we note, left its mark on other Imperial Greek writers besides Lucian: Longinus twice adduces the plastic arts in his analysis of great writing (De Subl. 30.1, 36.3; cf. 17.2, his one use of painting), and Philostratus makes Apollonius of Tyana's famous discussion of (pavtaoia (6.19) center on a comparison of Greek and Egyptian votive statuary. The epigrams of the Greek Anthology also show a decidedly greater interest in sculpture than in painting (see Gerda Schwartz, Die griechische Kunst des 5. und 4. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. im Spiegel der Anthologia Graeca [Vienna, 1971] 137-38), and Blumner has noted the same tendency in Martial's epigrams (90-91 n. 1). Beyond the parallel suggested by the process of copying, however, the sculptural analogy for literary composition becomes especially apt in Lucian because the sculptor's art, unlike that of the painter, involves a transformation of preexisting masses of material, in just the same way that authorial invention is designated a tkadoal or "shaping" of elements aleady present to his mind. The link between the two types of manipulation, physical and imaginative, is clearly illustrated by Lucian in Hist. Conscr. 51: "To put it in a nutshell, the writer of history ought to make it a rule to follow Phidias, or to imitate Praxiteles, or Alcamenes, or any of that ilk-for those men did not manufacture their gold or silver or ivory or any other material, but, using whatever was available or had been provided by the Eleans or Athenians or Argives, they only fashioned and cut up the ivory, and sanded and fastened and arranged it, and embellished it with gilt; this was their craft, to manage their material in whatever way was needful." Thus the sculptural metaphor already implied in terms like kadosa, xavcbv, and a&amp;oTvinoot;, which makes the artist's raw material an essential part of the creative process in a way it is not in painting, becomes explicit in Lucian to an extraordinary degree. Indeed, it is interesting to note that, while Lucian does discuss paintings in numerous works-Hippias, Dionysus, De Domo, Hercules, Zeuxis, Herodotus, Calmnia-his em phasis there is usually on the finished work rather than the technique that produced it (see Blumner 51-52). As a third factor motivating Lucian's preference for sculpture over painting in discussing the influence of the classics, we might observe that the Greek statue, because of its participation in religious iconography, was slower to develop and more closely tied to the ancient past than other art forms (see n. 60 infra). 5. Toynbee (supra n. 4: xxi f.) surveys briefly the debate among art critics over the "sterile classicism" inherent in Hadrian's appropriation of Classical Greek sculpture. Key contributors to the gaitolg debate in literary studies, the terms of which have been largely defined by Bompaire's massive study (supra n. 1), include E. L. Bowie, "Greeks and Their Past in the Second Sophistic," P&amp;P 46 (1970) 1-41; B. P. Reardon (supra n. 1: esp. 7-10); Graham Anderson, "Lucian, A Sophist's Sophist," YCIS 27 (1982) 67-92; B. A. van Groningen, "General Literary Tendencies in the Second Century A.D.," Mnemosyne 28 (1965) 41-65; J. Hall, Lucian's Satire (New York, 1981) esp. 128-50, 252-73; and, most recently, Jones (supra n. 1) chap. 13.</page><page sequence="4">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 77 as the greatest single creation surviving from Classical times.6 The scholia to the Odyssey, for example, cite the proverbial expression "as Phidias created his Zeus" in discussing the baldric of Heracles (11.613), a work so definitive that none like it could ever be made again. Similarly, Dio Chrysostom, in an oration delivered at Olympia in full view of the statue, takes Phidias to task for having established the one image of Zeus that had dominated all subsequent iconogra phy.7 In fact, the gold and ivory statue was so revered that Phidias was thought to have had divine inspiration, from one of two sources: either the famous lines of Homer's Iliad, depicting the terrible nodding of Zeus's head (1.527 ff.),8 or a mystical vision of the god himself.9 Thus this one work exemplified for Greeks of the empire the loftiest stratum of both their literary and religious traditions. In the latter case, in fact, the statue's nobility was such that it was imagined itself to partake of godhead, as when Philostratus's Apollonius of Tyana, visiting for the first time the temple at Olympia, cries out "Hail, noble Zeus, since you are so noble as to share yourself with mankind!" (4.38).1? Given that this one statue, then, perhaps more than any other single work of art, embodies the highest achievements of Greece's golden age, Lucian's treat ment of it is remarkably irreverent; he delights in deforming the Zeus or in 6. Bliimner's summary treatment of this statue's role in Lucian (supra n. 3: 19-20) is scarcely adequate; see the passages collected by J. Overbeck in Die antiken Schriftquellen zur Geschichte der bildenden Kiinste bei den Griechen (Leipzig, 1868) 125-36, where Lucian is cited eight times, sur passed only by Dio Chrysostom (whose twelfth or "Olympic" oration deals almost exclusively with Phidias's Zeus). The prominence of this one particular work of art in Lucian, and among Greeks of the empire in general, might be explained in various ways. Certainly its sheer size, the value of its materials, and the excellence of its workmanship made it an extraordinary relic. But beyond these factors, E. Norman Gardiner (Olympia [Oxford, 1925] 171-72) proposes that the importance of Zeus as a monotheistic symbol, syncretizing late Stoic and Neoplatonic religious beliefs, had much to do with the statue's popularity (for this point, see also L. Franqois, "Dion Chrysostome critique d'art," REG 30 [1917] 105-16). In addition, since this one statue had remained in situ despite the depradations of the Romans, and seems to have been infrequently copied, it may have appealed to the Greeks as a symbol of cultural autonomy (see Cassius Dio 49.28.3; and Josephus, Ant. Iud. 19.1, in which supernatural portents deter the Romans from removing the image). The great monument was finally carted off to Constantinople around 490 A.D., and perished shortly afterward in a severe conflagration. 7. Or. 12.53. For the artistic supremacy of Phidias as a trope in Hellenistic and Roman rhetori cal criticism, see J. J. Pollitt, The Ancient View of Greek Art: Criticism, History, Terminology (New Haven, 1974) 61. 8. Cf. Dio Chrys. 12.25, Strabo 8.3.30 (c354), Plut. Aem. Paull. 28, Val. Max. 3.7.4, Macrob. Sat. 5.13. Philostratus has Apollonius of Tyana contrast the fixity of Phidias's statue with the polymorphous images of Zeus in Homer (Vita Apol. 4.7). 9. Philippus, Anth. Gr. 16.81. The opposite view, that Phidias could not have actually seen the god himself (Cic. Orat. 9; Seneca Rhetor, Controv. 10.5.8; Plot. Enn. 5.8) seems to have arisen largely as an epistemologically based critique of this legend; the impression of epiphanic inspiration created by the statue was so powerful that it demanded some sort of response. Cf. Lucian, Pro Imag. 23 (infra n. 13); Pollitt (supra n. 7) 53-55, 57, 61 f., 83 f. 10. See P. Pucci ("Inscriptions archaiques sur les statues des dieux," in Les savoirs de I'ecriture en Grece ancienne, ed. M. Detienne [Lille, 1988], 484 f.) for the notion that "la statue realise d6ej une sorte d'epiphanie permanente dans le temple"; but the metonymy seldom has the vividness and immediacy expressed by Apollonius here.</page><page sequence="5">78 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 reshaping its majestical outlines. In his eyes Phidias's masterpiece had been born not out of an inspired passage of Homeric verse, but simply out of a common craftsman's desire to please his public (Pro Imaginibus 14): Don't be embarrassed to recast your essay after it has already been published. For they say that even Phidias did something like this, when he created his Zeus for the Eleans. The story is that, when he first unwrapped and exhibited the work, he stood behind the door, and listened to anyone who praised or criticized anything about it. One man criticized the nose for being too thick, another the face for being too long, and so on. Then Phidias, after the spectators had left, locked himself in and adjusted and reworked the statue to suit the judgment of the public. For he felt that the consensus of such a great throng must not be taken lightly, and that the many must always see more clearly than the individual, even if that individual were Phidias. This anecdote, which is found nowhere else and may well have been invented by Lucian,l1 turns the Olympian Zeus into a fluid form that can be molded to suit any critic, and Phidias into an artificer who, like Lucian himself, freely reshapes his material to win wider approval.12 Sculpture has herein become an analogue not for the literary masterpiece, but for the more impermanent and flexible essays cultivated by Lucian's circle-in this case the author's own Imagines, a work we shall look at in more detail below. Elsewhere, Lucian "retools" Phidias's statue not so much as an artistic icon but as an emblem of the religious life of high antiquity, and here too his treat ment is highly irreverent. Playfully inverting the trope by which the statue stands in for the actual divinity,13 Lucian, in two different dialogues, portrays Zeus as a "figurehead" ruler imprisoned within his own sculpted form: Timon [lamenting the corruption of his society]: Slowly but surely, O you most noble of gods, men are revealing you a Cronus, and squeezing 11. Harmon (n. ad loc. in Loeb ed., vol. 4) and Bliimner (supra n. 3: 19) compare a similar anecdote told by Pliny the Elder about Apelles (NH 35.84 f.). But Apelles in this story makes only very discriminating use of the public's criticisms. Bliimner also compares Ael. VH 14.8, an anecdote concerning Polycleitus, and supposes that many such stories attached themselves to Phidias's all encompassing name. For Phidias's frivolity, cf. the curious story found in Clement of Alexandria (Protrept. 53) and Arnobius (Adv. Nat. 6.13) relating how the sculptor carved an amatory graffito onto the finger of his greatest work. 12. The effect is similar to that which Lucian achieves in the Vera Historia by depicting Homer, the grand master of all Greek literature, as a humble poetaster who simply wrote whatever had happened to come to mind (2.20). Although capable of eulogizing great minds (cf. Nigrinus, De monax), Lucian much preferred to unseat their greatness; the allegedly biographical anecdote re lated by Galen, in which the satirist mocks a noted scholar by asking him to interpret forged fragments of Heraclitus, gives good insight into his technique (see G. Strohmaier, "Ubersehenes zur Biographie Lukians," Philologus 120 [1976] 117-22). 13. Lucian elsewhere ridicules the notion that the gods are accurately represented in their statues: "Is it not impious to opine such things about deities, whose forms I, for my part, assume to be beyond the reach of human imitation?" (Pro Imag. 23).</page><page sequence="6">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 79 you out of your place of honor. I need not say how many times they have already plundered your temple; but now they have laid hands on your very person, at Olympia, while you, high-thunderer, hesitated to whistle up the dogs or call out the neighbors, so they might come to your aid and arrest the thieves while they were still preparing to get away. No, you, the noble Giant-slayer, you, the Titan-conqueror, you just sat there while they clipped your hair, still holding your fifteen-foot thunderbolt in your right hand!14 (Timon 4) Zeus [responding to a suggestion that he strike a mortal with lightning]: Are you joking, Poseidon, or have you forgotten that nothing of this kind is in our power? Rather the Fates allot their threads to each man, for one to die by the thunderbolt, another by the sword, a third by fever or disease. If this kind of thing were possible for me, do you suppose that the other day I would have let those temple robbers get out of Olympia unblasted, after they had clipped off two of my curls, each one worth as much as six minae?15 (Zeus Tragoedus 25) The weightiness of sculpture here translates into immobility and impotence rather than august grandeur, so that the great locks of the god's hair-the same, it should be noted, that toss so terribly in the Homeric passage thought to have inspired Phidias-can now be lopped off by common sneak thieves. Lucian depicts Zeus as an ivory fossil, incapable of defending even his own most hal lowed shrine. Not only Phidias's Zeus, moreover, but all Classical statuary serves Lucian as a symbol of the rigor mortis afflicting traditional religion. In the second of the two dialogues quoted above, the Zeus Tragoedus, for example, Lucian creates a scenario in which Zeus, having seen the atheistic philosopher Damis about to win a debate on theology, urgently convokes an assembly of gods to deal with the crisis. Each deity arrives as his or her most famous statue: Aphrodite as the Cnidian marble of Praxiteles, Hermes as Lysippus's bronze image, and so on. 14. According to Pausanias (5.11.1), the god held no thunderbolt but an image of victory in his right hand, a scepter in his left. Lucian's error is explained by Ludwig Drees (Olympia [Stuttgart, 1967] 182) as a carryover from the ubiquitous Homeric tradition, and by Blimner (supra n. 3: 19) as a confusion with some other statue of Zeus. Seneca the Elder commits a similar error at Controv. 10.5.8: "non vidit Phidias Iovem, fecit tamen velut tonantem." 15. To my knowledge there is no evidence of an actual incident of theft that might have given rise to this story; certainly it is the sort of thing Lucian routinely invents. Nor can we be certain whether "just the other day" here refers to the author's own time or that of the dialogue (which is itself vague). Lucian shows a curious indifference to timescale when dealing with ancient monu ments, for example treating the Colossus of Rhodes here (11) and in the Icaromenippus (12) as if it were still intact, whereas in fact the huge bronze had toppled in 227 B.C. (for discussion of this point, see Jones [supra n. 1] 157 and nn. 48-50). In the Icaromenippus, Lucian's Zeus asks his human visitor, Menippus, whether any of Phidias's descendants are still around (24), acknowledging at least indirectly that the age that produced his greatest icon has passed.</page><page sequence="7">80 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 Lucian makes good comic sport out of the fantasy, by having Hermes figure up the net worth of each massy figure (8-12), but there is also a larger issue at stake: as each deity comes forth and proposes a stale, ineffectual solution to the prob lem at hand, it becomes clear that the gods are inflexibly bound by their legend ary roles and thus helpless in the face of a new challenge.16 Lucian ultimately leaves the Olympians to watch in horror as Damis wins the day, still lacking the resourcefulness to prevent their own slide into obsolescence. If the old order of Hellenic culture and religion are cast by Lucian in metal and stone, however, the new order is associated in the Zeus Tragoedus with sculpture of a very different kind. In the dialogue's paratragic opening scene, Zeus cries out against his enemies in terms borrowed from Euripides (1):17 You all-villainous things, earthen playthings of dust [X0o6va yig rcal,6evwTa], And thou, Prometheus, what evils thou hast formed for me! Lucian here refers to mankind as a creature who, according to a myth popular in Hellenistic and Roman times,l8 was first sculpted by Prometheus out of earth and saliva, thereby creating an opposition between the plasticity of the new race and the rigid, monolithic character of the Olympian regime.'9 Moreover, it is again Prometheus, as we saw initially in the Prometheus Es in Verbis, who is cast as the 16. Cf. Dio Chrys. 12.70, where the immobility of the sculpted image is compared with the polymorphism and "movements" of the poet's art. Jones (supra n. 1: 39) seems aware of the issue when he remarks that "the anthropomorphism of the gods . . . indirectly satirizes conventional conceptions of them," but misses the particular relevance of the sculptural metaphor. 17. At least, the couplet has been grouped among the fragments of Euripides by Nauck (fr. 939). Lucian may have intended an ironic misappropriation of Athens' most innovative tragedian, since all the tragic verses that Zeus parodies here derive from Euripides (others, however, are imitated or quoted from the Iliad). 18. This myth, which may have been unknown to Hesiod and Aeschylus (but cf. the reference to mankind as xltr6nXaacov oGceQtca by Aeschylus, fr. 369 Nauck), has been traced back at least to the fourth century B.C.: see L. Eckhart, "Prometheus," RE 23.1 (1957) 696-98; L. Sechan, Le mythe de Promethde (Paris, 1951) 33, 103 n. 78. The earliest extant references, however, date from the Augustan age: cf. Hor. Carm. 1.16.13-16, Ov. Metam. 1.82-8; and, later, Juv. 6.13, 14.35; Paus. 10.4.4; Apollod. 1.7.1; Phaedr. 4.15, 16 (among others cited by Eckhart). In the earliest Greek traditions, mankind had no particular author, but was created by "the gods" generally (Hes. Erga 109), or sprang spontaneously from oak and stone (e.g., Od. 19.162). Cf. Roscher s.v. "Weltsch6p fung," cols. 498-504. 19. We might also, following Mikhail Bakhtin (Rabelais and His World, tr. H6elne Iswolsky [Bloomington, Ind., 1984] 24-30), point out the contrast in the different degrees of permeability that different levels of society ascribe to the human form: the marble statue represents the body as closed and inflexibly bounded, reflecting high-culture notions of human completeness and self-sufficiency, whereas more porous materials open themselves up to low-culture processes of growth and change. Thus the Greek sculptor used the phrase is o6vvxa to designate the standard of perfection in his craft; the ideal statue, like the ideal man, had a perfectly unbroken surface, as if smoothed by the edge of a fingernail (cf. the phrase's Latin equivalent at Pers. 1.65). By contrast, Lucian himself specializes in perforating the human form, as in his grotesque descriptions of the marsupial Selenites in the Vera Historia (1.21-26) or his reconfiguration of Homeric heroes into naked skeletons in the Dialogi Mortuorum (esp. 5, 6, 9).</page><page sequence="8">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 81 exemplary nZrlkXojXkaog or clay molder, a role that here sets him squarely in opposi tion to Olympus. In an ironic reversal of chronology a member of the oldest of old guards, the Titan regime, is herein seen as part-author of the new ideas of Epi curean science;20 and the challenge that authorship poses to Zeus's power seems to derive, in some unspecified fashion, from his whimsical experiments in clay. Prometheus, in fact, appears frequently in Lucian's writings as an innovator who threatens the entire world order simply by molding a handful of mud. The Prometheus Es is only marginally relevant here, since it ignores the problem of Prometheus's anti-Olympianism and focuses instead on other aspects of his art (points we shall return to below).21 But two of Lucian's satiric dialogues, the Prometheus and the fifth of the Dialogi Deorum, depict Prometheus as an artistic revolutionary, condemned to exposure in the Caucasus for the unorthodoxy of his work in clay. In the Prometheus, for instance, Prometheus argues his case sophist-style before his jailers, Hermes and Hephaestus,22 and opens the apolo gia with a lengthy and impassioned defense of the crime he calls i JTkcaoTtxi, that is, the creation of mankind (11-17). He demonstrates conclusively that this act has not harmed but benefited the Olympian hierarchy, but still fails to win his case. As in Aeschylus's drama the Olympians remain locked in a sternly defen sive posture, but here their wrath seems directed more at Prometheus's crime of nrXaoTtxrl than at his more traditional offenses, the theft of fire and the presenta tion of fraudulent offerings.23 Why should mere creation out of clay draw such a harsh response from Olympus? The Prometheus does not answer this question in explicit terms (nor does the fifth of the Dialogi Deorum), but supplies some clues as to where an answer should be sought. In his accusation of Prometheus, Hermes frames the charge of tXaoTlxrl in three different ways, each time emphasizing a different aspect of it: "You fashioned mankind, thoroughly rascally creatures (especially the women)" (3);24 "You fashioned mankind when it was forbidden" (6); "If you 20. It is interesting to observe how the archaic attains a kind of modernistic panache as classical forms grow hoary with age; we might, for example, compare the ways in which Greek tragedy has been resurrected in the past two decades, in a variety of new guises, as an antidote to sterile traditionalism in the theater. 21. M. D. Macleod points out that the speech in fact scrupulously avoids the one aspect of Prometheus's mythology that would have been most prominent for its audience: see "A Note on Lucian's Prometheus Es in Verbis," CQ 50 (1956) 237. 22. Cf. Bompaire (supra n. 1) 129, 248. 23. In none of the other sources listed by Eckhart (supra n. 18) is it suggested that Prometheus opposed the will of Zeus by creating mankind; indeed, he is often assumed to have done so at the Olympian's behest (e.g., Plato, Protag. 320D, Hor. Carm. 1.16.13). Macleod (supra n. 21) displays some confusion over the issue when he asserts that "men . . . incurred the displeasure of Zeus because they were the recipients of fire," explaining one crime by conflating it with another. S6chan (supra n. 18: 84) incorrectly asserts that Lucian's portrayal of Prometheus is derived from those of Hesiod and Aeschylus. 24. The creation of woman is also mentioned as a separate offense at Dial. Deor. 5.1, another way in which Lucian's treatment of the myth appears to be unique (see Harry Levy's comment ad loc. in Lucian: Seventy Dialogues [Norman, Okla., 1976]).</page><page sequence="9">82 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 admit that you produced innovations [xaLvovQgyfioal] with regard to mankind, then the accusation is proven" (6). This last version of the charge, stressing Prometheus's revision of the established order of things, seems to be the most damning, to judge by the way the Titan handles it in his defense speech (13): You see the egregious penalty I suffer for making creatures out of clay, and for bringing hitherto motionless matter into motion. Moreover, it appears that from that moment forth the gods are less godly, simply because some mortal creatures have come into being upon the earth; for Zeus is actually so angry that you'd think the gods were reduced in stature by the creation of man. Any deviation from the status quo poses a serious threat to these Olympians, especially if the innovation disrupts the existential categories they have established-in this case, giving motion to what had been created motionless. Prometheus the n9konka.OoS presents a danger largely because of his originality, then; it is not the invention itself that is chiefly held culpable so much as the very act of inventing. The esthetic issues Lucian raises in this discussion of kcraolxtx clearly have their roots in the author's own concern over the dominance of the Phidian masterpiece within his culture; that is, both Prometheus and Lucian rebel against the authority of an Olympian Zeus, the god himself in the former case, in the latter the statue that seemed to embody that godhead.25 At the same time, the artistic freedom configured in the myth of Prometheus the ntronkao&amp;0og exempli fies for Lucian a spirit of playful, irreverent nonconformity, in contrast to the rigidity of antiquated tradition, and so he too, as we shall see below, uses soft materials to challenge the supremacy of stone. We can begin to understand from the Prometheus, then, why the figure of the sculptor-subversive looms so large in Lucian's corpus, and why his molding of clay becomes such a central and sugges tive concern. Prometheus's reworking of Olympian forms parallels in many ways Lucian's own response to the classicizing esthetic embodied in Phidias's Olym pian statue; the satirist has therefore adopted Prometheus as a standard bearer in his struggle to break up the rigidity of works etched in stone. The various strategies and counterstrategies by which this struggle was waged are explored at length in the Prometheus Es in Verbis, an especially rich and varie gated speech,26 whose opening sentences we have already glanced at above and 25. Macleod (supra n. 21) puts the parallel somewhat differently, but makes essentially the same point. 26. I am much indebted to Branham (supra n. 1: 239-40) in my discussion of this complex work, which merits more attention than it has received. See also Macleod (supra n. 21), and the response by Hall (supra n. 5: 455 n. 46). Bompaire (supra n. 1: 705) himself adopts the analogy of "Prometheus in words" in describing one of the most original features of Lucian's art, the use of fantasy to transform rhetorical commonplaces.</page><page sequence="10">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 83 to which we shall return at several points below. Here, Lucian is concerned with a number of esthetic issues, including, as in the Prometheus, that of innovation. The essential problem for the Promethean artist is here framed as the converse of what it was in the apologia of that dialogue, however. Rather than incurring the disdain of Olympian authorities, the lkonkatXdQoo instead runs the risk of gaining shallow, insubstantial acclaim from a spectacle-hungry mob. In the opening portion of the Prometheus Es Lucian plays a set of variations on the theme of his friend's remark, examining several ways in which his own technique parallels that of Prometheus. He finally balks at applying the compari son, however, when the issue of innovation is raised (3): Someone might comfort me by saying, "[Your friend] compared you to Prometheus so as to praise your novelty [xalvouvyov], and your way of not imitating [?ECL[tYrltpEvov] any archetype; just like your predecessor, who fashioned men out of his imagination [ivvoitoag] when none as yet existed." . . But it wouldn't satisfy me to be seen as an innovator, nor for people not to recognize some older object from which my work has sprung. If it weren't graceful, I would be ashamed of it, rest assured, and would trample it into oblivion; novelty [xatv6ozrg] would not be enough, in my eyes, to prevent a clumsy piece from being dashed to pieces. Prometheus, who appears here as an even bolder innovator than in the dialogue Prometheus-working only from his own mental conception, rather than making mankind in god's image-suddenly represents the wrong kind of originality, one that ignores ancient models and substitutes cheap novelty for a more elegant grace of composition. As a result, Lucian takes his first step away from the role model he had proudly embraced at the outset of the speech. Why is Lucian so reluctant here to accept his own reputation for xaLvo6rTg? Clearly the fan who reminds him of it means to pay him a compliment, as do the hypothetical public who praise Lucian's novelty even while failing to recognize his archetypes. However, this is not the public he hopes to attract, as we discover in the next portion of the Prometheus Es. Expanding on the idea of novelty, Lucian adduces the example of a freakish camel and a half-black, half-white man Ptolemy had exhibited before the Egyptians, who, having enough sophistication to prefer harmony and grace of form (T6o EQDv06LOv xaCa To EutOQCpov) over mere xalvoTrl (4), greeted the spectacle with scorn. However, when Lucian then compares his own literary invention, the comic dialogue, to this animal side show, he fears that his "camel" will be admired rather than rejected for its strangeness. Clearly a wide gap separates the tastes of Ptolemy's Egyptians, Lucian's ideal audience, from those of the crowd he is actually addressing, and it is this gap that troubles him when he considers the artistic license his Promethean paradigm confers. The auditors of the Prometheus Es seem only too willing to gawk at ungainly freaks, while Lucian himself feels he will become another tasteless Ptolemy if he provides them.</page><page sequence="11">84 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 Yet at the same time Lucian feels a great pride in the originality of his most freakish creation, the comic dialogue. He compares it in the Prometheus Es to a centaur, and smugly calls it 1iPQaoOTzaTov, "highly outrageous," like the cen taurs seen drinking and rioting in famous paintings.27 Then, at the end of the speech, Lucian again adduces the analogy of the hybrid animal, this time in a discussion of Prometheus's thievery (7): This charge alone you could not apply to my career. For from whom could I have stolen? Unless somebody else has stuck together these hippocamps and tragelaphs, without my being aware of it. Anyway, what else can I do, except stay with the techniques I have already chosen? For to change one's style is the mark of an Epimetheus, not a Prometheus. The ambivalence of this ending reveals an unresolved conflict underlying Lu cian's artistic goals: he dreads gaining a reputation for mere novelty yet also enjoys being perceived as a one-of-a-kind innovator. The hybrid creations that divert attention from his most accomplished art form, the reworking of Classical models, also become a figure for the inventiveness that gives him his greatest appeal. Lucian's intentions here may be easier to sort out if we range his various exemplars along a scale of creative originality. Novel though they may be, Lu cian's hippocamps and tragelaphs are still less daring than Prometheus's free handed creation of mankind; after all, their forms, like their names, simply recombine existing genera,28 just as man and horse are still recognizable in the centaur. At the same time Lucian's literary crossbreed of Aristophanic comedy and Platonic dialogue is quite obviously more original than a straightforward imitation of either genre. Thus the analogy of the hybrid animal offers Lucian a compromise between the sensationalism of complete xaWvoxTg, which uses no template for its creations at all, and the more sophisticated revision of ancient models he describes as a process of i[dltiog. In fact, whereas Lucian had held aloof from Prometheus the freestyle rXkonkaXd0og, he embraces his model again at the end of the Prometheus Es when the Titan becomes a creator of hybrids in his own right, accidentally splicing together male and female forms after a night of drinking with Dionysus (7).29 27. This evocation of the centauromachy motif is again intended to align Lucian's innovations with the Promethean, anti-Olympian school of art; they correspond to the unruly beasts that, accord ing to standard fifth- and fourth-century iconography, revolt against the authority of Apollo and Athena. See Page duBois, Centaurs and Amazons: Women and the Prehistory of the Great Chain of Being (Ann Arbor, 1982) chap. 2. 28. Ancient theories of perception and cognition held that every hybrid image had to be composed of elements from objects that had once been taken in by the senses (see, e.g., Lucr. DRN 4.731 ff.). For an extensive treatment of the esthetic and philosophical issues embodied in the hybrid animal, see the fascinating survey by G. Sillitti, Tragelaphos, Elenchos 1 (Rome, 1980). 29. Cf. Phaedr. 4.16, where the story is told to explain the origin of homosexuals.</page><page sequence="12">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 85 The contrast Lucian establishes between the extremes of this spectrum, moreover-freakish novelty versus subtle revision of archetypes-is reflected, less explicitly, in a split between two kinds of audience: a general public eager for grotesquerie, and the jE3jaL6evA?voL or men of letters seeking a more refined form of intellectual gratification. Hybrid creatures and similar spectacles can be counted on to win the applause of the masses (as one of Lucian's characters notes elsewhere, in the Hermotimus);30 but such forms also alienate the sophisticates, who are thereby deprived of the pleasure of spotting clever variations in familiar models. It has often been observed that Lucian addresses himself primarily to the latter group, but it is less often noted how frequently he seems to feel himself surrounded by the former,31 as he does in the Prometheus Es. Thus Lucian at first shies away from the fans who praise his novelty, as if ducking an alliance that cheapens his reputation; but later in the speech he becomes reconciled to his popular appeal, as he uncovers ways of combining [L[ogWlS with xatvo6qtg. Ulti mately, however, this conflict too remains unresolved: in the final sentence Lucian somewhat ruefully accepts innovation as his lot, still concerned that it has lost him the educated following he seeks. The problem of audience is further explored in the Zeuxis, a prolalia that focuses more explicitly than the Prometheus Es on the conflict between popular appeal and critical approbation. The painter Zeuxis exhibits a dramatically origi nal painting of a female centaur, then becomes disgusted when the canvas arouses only voyeuristic fascination among his fellow Athenians. Enraged, he directs one of his pupils to remove the work (7): Come along, Micio, wrap up the painting; all of you, pick it up and take it home. For these people appreciate only the clay [klXov] of our craft, but as to whether the light is captured well and artfully, they take no thought; the novelty of the subject eclipses the accuracy of the workmanship. 30. Lycinus, Lucian's mouthpiece, compares Hermotimus's naive philosophical concepts to "the hippocentaurs and gorgons and chimeras, and whatever other dreams the poets and painters, with the freedom to do as they please, have fashioned [avan.kadTnov iv], though they never existed and can never exist. Nevertheless the masses [6 jcokXg Ke6g] believe them and are spellbound when they see or hear about such things, because of their strangeness and unfamiliarity" (72). 31. The question of Lucian's audience has been somewhat clouded by the satirist's own contra dictory statements on the subject, and by a scholarly tendency to emphasize his higher cultural aspirations over his desire for popularity. Thus Jones, for example, takes Lucian too much at his word when he describes his readers and auditors as "wealthy and refined" (supra n. 1: 15) and "not the unlettered public but the 'cultured,' 'those who pursue letters' " (23). The passage of the Piscator cited in support of both statements does indeed assert that Lucian "calls together the best men [rovi adpioovg]" when giving a recitation (26). But the section immediately preceding this describes his currency among the masses (&amp;a jtkX10r, 6 7oXi.sg X6cg, 25), who, like the audiences of Old Comedy, delight in mocking higher culture (oetvo6TaTa). The question of audience needs to be discussed at greater length than I can devote to it here, but it should be clear from the examples adduced that Lucian felt attracted to both the high artistic standing conferred by the ?3TE3ta6EUvuvoL and the loud applause of the nr.iO'v\, and that he often promotes the former over the latter as a way of gaining cultural capital on the cheap.</page><page sequence="13">86 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 Zeuxis's centaur, like Lucian's comic dialogue-itself compared to a centaur in the Prometheus Es32-exemplifies the Promethean artist's dilemma: his ability to hybridize the world of physical form, treating it as fodder for creative inter combination rather than strict imitation, attracts only the superficial acclaim of the mob instead of more substantive praise.33 And Lucian once again associates this hybridizing capability with the properties of clay, in that Zeuxis refers to the sensational subject matter of his canvas as tikXog. This unique usage seems to encompass both the idea of "dross," mere content as opposed to technique, and that of malleability, as if the Promethean artist actually converts the physical world into plasma within his imagination.34 Thus the "clayiness" of this artist's medium is seen as both the greatest source of his popularity among the mob, and the greatest threat to his standing among the X:EaL86Ev?utvoL. This speech, too, reveals an essential ambivalence in Lucian's attitude to ward innovation, and an uneasiness in his affection for the audience it attracts. He initially treats Zeuxis's canvas as a negative exemplar, claiming, as he had in the Prometheus Es, to resent being praised for novelty (xatvo6xr;) and exoticism (naQact6ooXoyta) to the exclusion of stylistic elegance (1). However, this protest begins to sound increasingly disingenuous as the speech progresses. Lucian re veals that he, like the undiscriminating crowd in the anecdote, had gawked (v6intE0alaoaiL, 3) at the portrait when he came across it recently in Athens. He signals us that his own description of the canvas, moreover, will focus only on its Jfinog and ignore the finer points of Zeuxis's technique: "I leave it to the brood of artists to praise these things, since that is their business" (5). In his conclusion Lucian goes further still, virtually equating his own speech with the portrait of the centauress while still hoping, paradoxically, that his present audience will show more sophistication than Zeuxis's had. Indeed the Zeuxis, as its fuller title Zeuxis sive Antiochus indicates, is a kind 32. As well as in the Bis Accusatus (33). On the importance of the centaur as a symbol of Lucian's peculiar art, see Christopher Robinson, Lucian and His Influence in Europe (Chapel Hill, N.C., 1979) 8; Branham (supra n. 1) 239-40. Branham also deals with the question of how widely the symbol is meant to apply (ibid. n. 6). 33. Horace, a champion of the Classical esthetic if ever there was one, expressly forbids the use of hybrid forms in the opening lines of the Ars Poetica (see the discussion of this passage by Geoffrey Harpham, On the Grotesque: Strategies of Contradiction in Art and Literature [Princeton, 1982] 26 27; and the more general comments on the Greek mistrust of hybrids in Rhys Carpenter, The Esthetic Basis of Greek Art2 [Bloomington, Ind., 1959] 20-21). During the period of Lucian's great est popularity in Renaissance Europe, some artists thumbed their noses at Horace by deliberately reproducing the image he forbids (see Harpham 197 n. 11 and fig. 29; Glyn P. Norton, "The Horatian Grotesque in Renaissance France: The Genesis of a Poetic Formula," Romanic Review 65 [1974] 157-74). 34. We might compare the use of Uiii in esthetic criticism to distinguish the primal "matter" the artist adopts from the form he later imposes on it. [Longinus], for example, speaks of norltLxa g XaStg in connection with the process of anoxt61ooLg described above (De Subl. 13.4). For Lucian's use of viXr in this context, cf. Zeus Trag. 7, 11; Hist. Conscr. 50.</page><page sequence="14">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 87 of centaur in its own right.35 Following his report of Zeuxis's tirade, quoted above, Lucian moves abruptly from his pictorial analogy to a very different example of sensationalism (8): Thus spoke Zeuxis, perhaps somewhat angrily; and Antiochus, nick named the Savior, is also said to have experienced something similar in his battle against the Galatians. If you like I'll tell you how this came about as well. The anecdote that follows does indeed connect with that of Zeuxis, in that it describes Antiochus's use of another novel animal, the elephant, to astonish his enemy. Nevertheless the jarring and willful transition from one figure to the other, bridged in a purely perfunctory manner by a t&amp;v-&amp;e antithesis, empha sizes quite deliberately the incongruity between them. The entire speech has thus been framed as a literary hybrid, suggesting that Lucian, although concerned that his audience sometimes misses the finer points of his craft, ultimately craves the acclaim that accrues to xav6oTYg. While pretending to distance himself from Zeuxis he has ingeniously recreated the most lurid aspects of the offending canvas. Perhaps Lucian's most probing inquiry into hybrid artistry, however, deals not with the question of audience but, on a more theoretical level, with the very legitimacy of creative recombination. The Imagines or "Portrayals" depicts Lycinus, Lucian's mouthpiece, and Polystratus, otherwise unknown, attempting to describe a beautiful woman Lycinus has recently encountered. Together these two construct a portrait of the woman-who turns out to be Pantheia of Smyrna, mistress of the emperor Verus36-by adding on sequential layers of description: first Lycinus becomes a verbal "sculptor," appropriating antique statuary in order to depict her body, and next Polystratus animates the portrait by "paint ing" her spiritual traits. The dialogue thus evokes Plato's Republic, in which Socrates constructs his imaginary city in a similarly layered manner, but also takes the form of an amoebic song contest in that the two participants, on Lycinus's challenge, strive to outdo one another in accuracy of portraiture. Finally, in a closing comment, Polystratus suggests that his painting of Pantheia's soul be combined with Lycinus's sculpture of her body, so as to form a truer 35. Robinson (supra n. 32: 8), in discussing the Zeuxis, notes that "the choice of the hippocentaur is a peculiarly happy symbol for the hybrid novelties of Lucian's literary forms," although he seems to have missed the particular application to this very speech. 36. For her history, see Jones (supra n. 1) 75 and the sources cited there. The elaborate praises that the two interlocutors heap on her have been seen as Lucian's rather shameless attempt to ingratiate himself with the royal court, but, while Lucian is no doubt guilty on this charge, the concerns of the dialogue also run far beyond mere flattery. Its characters become, in effect, two artists in search of a medium, as they grapple with the problem of how to represent the qualities of an extraordinary human being.</page><page sequence="15">88 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 E?ixtv-a "likeness" conceived at once in sculptural, graphic, and verbal terms of the entire woman. Art, rather than life, provides the raw material for hybridization in this dialogue. Modestly asking the ancient artisans to come to his aid, Lycinus makes a list of the five most striking female statues of high antiquity: Praxiteles' Cnidian Aphrodite; Alcamenes' Aphrodite in the Gardens; the Sosandra of Calamis,37 and the Lemnia and Amazon of Phidias. Having set out these images, Lycinus proposes to make a composite of their best parts, relying on his own koyog as chief surgeon (5): Lycinus: So then, out of all these [five statues] I shall, insofar as I am able, put together and reveal to you a single eixdWv, which will have the choicest parts of each. Polystratus: And how could that be done? Lycinus: It's not difficult, Polystratus, if, from now on, we hand our statues over to the 6oyos and entrust to it to adapt and reat tach and combine them as elegantly as possible, while still holding on to that certain sense of synthesis and variety. Polystratus: Yes, you're right. By all means let it get started and show what it can do. In the hands of Lycinus's koyog the solidity of sculpted stone melts into putty, to be pulled apart and reassembled as the artist dictates.38 Indeed, in the next passage, the statues that have been selected-representing among them the greatest achievements of the fifth and fourth centuries-are dismembered and recombined with a rapidity that bespeaks the deftness of the surgeon's hand. Lucian, whom we have seen described as a synthesizer of hippocamps and tragelaphs, here succeeds in hybridizing effortlessly even the firmest and most unyielding of Classical forms, the stone statue.39 Polystratus, however, challenges the validity of this hybrid esthetic when he takes over the construction of the portrait. More traditional than Lycinus in his artistic tastes, he proposes to treat Pantheia's qualities singly on separate "can vases" so as to avoid this kind of intercombination (15): Polystratus: There you have a single eixoCv, of her vocal talent and her singing, although one can scarcely do them justice. Look now at these 37. The identity of this statue is obscure; for the debate, see Blumner (supra n. 3) 7-15. 38. The technique is again reminiscent of Plato's Republic, but goes far beyond: whereas, in the Republic, the koyos had served only as an instrument of construction, here it is personified as a kind of omnipotent plastic artist, capable of detaching and melding pieces of solid stone at will. Cf. Croiset (supra n. 3) 273. 39. Jones (supra n. 1) seems to have missed the importance of Lycinus's rough treatment of Classical statuary when he remarks that Lucian is here "exalting" these works and therefore "could count on the sympathy of his cultured readership" (76). Polystratus, clearly a representative of the tF?3caL6evutvot, is manifestly unsympathetic to his opponent (see infra).</page><page sequence="16">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 89 other Eixo6ve as well: for I have decided not to display a single eixbov put together out of many, as you did, [for that's less painterly (y?aqptxov), that is, to join together so many different kinds of beauty,] and construct a multiform thing out of many parts, so that it is actually in conflict with itself-but rather, all the virtues of her soul will be painted one by one, as a single EIxCov, which will closely imitate [|ttlEl.FEiVXl] the archetype. Even if we delete the bracketed text, as Macleod does-a harsh step, since the Greek is nearly sound40-the passage is still intelligible as a conservative's attack on the very strategy Lucian had embraced in the Prometheus Es and the Zeuxis. The Promethean artist who willfully restructures the Classical heritage violates the standard of esthetic propriety known collectively as intYolg or "imitation" of ancient archetypes; Polystratus himself promises to uphold these standards by avoiding hybrids. In fact he prefaces his portraiture with a sarcastic play on Lycinus's sculptural metaphor: he vows to make his description conform pre cisely to the "rules" (xav6vag) of Classical literature and to display the final "statue" (&amp;yalk[a) as something prepared "according to the ancient style of modeling" (xcaTa xrv aQXaiav Jt aottxriv, 12).41 Having thoroughly rejected Lycinus's technique, then, Polystratus sets out to do his opponent's portrait one better, according to the original terms of the contest. However, where the rules of the game have been established by Lucian, a traditionalist like Polystratus can scarcely hope to prevail. No sooner has he uttered his condemnation of the hybrid style than he falls back on it himself, in an effort to depict his subject's rac&amp;6eia (16): Polystratus: Come, then, let us now create an image [of her JaL6eia], though it will be variegated and multi-formed, so that I shall not in this case fall short of your plastic style [Tfg oijg ktaocTLxYg]. So, let it be painted with all the virtues of the Muses, taken together, . . . and those of Hermes and Apollo as well. Beyond that, let the Eixcbv be adorned with all the qualities that the poets have embellished with meter, or that the rhetoricians have adduced while holding sway with their magnifi cence, or that the historians have related, or that the philosophers have praised. ... And pardon me, if I am unable to show any archetype for this painting; for, as regards cal6&amp;i a, we have heard of nothing compara ble among the ancients [ev ToLg JnaXal]. It is surely no accident that Polystratus, having just spoken out for strict adher ence to ancient archetypes, fails at this critical moment to find a single archetype he can use. Instead he retreats directly into the enemy camp, furiously slapping 40. As Harmon notes ad loc. in the Loeb edition, the participle ovTvTeEoa0Ev must be made into some type of infinitive for the passage to cohere.

Behind the whole exchange we hear the laughter of the author as he playfully remolds his own created character; Lucian has won the contest for his mouthpiece Lycinus, by making the rigid, antiquarian Polystratus turn as flexible as clay. The final speech of the Imagines, also spoken by Polystratus, secures the victory of plasticity over the monolithic integrity of Classical form (23): Polystratus: If you agree, let us mix together these ixo6veS, the one you sculpted of her body and the ones I drew of her soul, and, joining them all into one, let's put it down in a book and offer it to everyone to marvel at, both our contemporaries and our descendants. It would, at any rate, be a more long-lasting work than those of Apelles and Parrhasius and Polygnotus, and by far more pleasant for the lady herself than anything produced by those types, in that it has not been made from wood and wax and colors, but depicted by means of inventions42 derived from the Muses; and this would indeed be the most exacting kind of portrait, since it reveals at the same time the beauty of the body and the virtue of the soul. The Imagines itself is here revealed as an exemplary Promethean hybrid, uniting, as its title suggests, imagery drawn from sculpture, painting, and literature.43 The entire canon of Classical portraiture has, in effect, been melted down in the crucible of the Xoyog, making it suitable raw material for a portraiture governed by invention rather than imitation. Lycinus and Polystratus, themselves joined together here in a final coup of Promethean synthesis, have succeeded in a pioneering attempt at reprocessing this material, producing a bizarre new eFxcbv every bit as modern and jarring as one of Picasso's fragmented faces. We observed at the onset that Lucian treats his sculptural metaphor as a lifelong project, returning to it again and again throughout his career to pick out new strands of meaning,44 and therefore we have been obliged to range widely through his corpus in order to track down all its major occurrences. Thus far we have seen some of the ways in which this metaphor defines the role of the innovating artist by aligning him with Prometheus against the Olympians, by enabling him to hybridize objects from the world around him, and by connecting 42.

Other metaphors that lie scattered throughout the entire Lucianic corpus include that of "all the world's a stage," and that of society as an enormous ship. The wide diffusion of such metaphors has meant that only a few scholars have thus far explored them in full; chief among these is Graham Anderson (Lucian: Theme and Variation in the Second Sophistic, Mnemosyne Suppl. 41 [Leiden, 1976]).

Let us turn now to some other facets of the plastic-arts metaphor, in which the literary work itself, as well as the artist's technique, is characterized in terms borrowed from sculpture and, in particular, from clay-molding. Here we shall find Lucian more concerned with the shortcomings than the advantages of his chosen craft: plastic creations may be seen as facile or cheap, due to their too-easy versatility; their impermanence may force the author to give up all claim on posterity; or their "clay" may dry out and become brittle, liable to smash apart if jostled by an unfriendly critic. We shall also find that Lucian particularly likes to explore these perils by contrasting his own soft materials with other, more durable ones: clay with gold and ivory, wet clay with dry, and, finally, wax with stone. At the start of the Prometheus Es in Verbis, as we have seen, Lucian accepts his role as a literary 79kXoatX.6og and even seems well pleased with his friend's comparison. But his tone soon changes when he considers his raw material, which seems to him mere filth (Po6QoQo6g TLg), like the dirt scraped from gutters (1). By contrast, Lucian's imaginary addressee, a courtroom orator, shapes his creations out of finer stuff: "[Your profession] too would be Promethean, except that you differ from him in one respect: you sculpt your models for the most part out of gold, not clay" (1). "Gold" here refers perhaps to the profitability of legal oratory, but also, certainly, to the seriousness of purpose and tone that gives it more weight than the sophist's craft.45 The different elevations of the two branches of oratory are here given concrete expression in a contrast of hard and soft elements, which reveals rather strikingly the insufficiency of the latter: Lucian's clay may impart a certain "earthiness" but not the solidity that distin guishes more esteemed art forms. Lucian goes on in the Prometheus Es to explore further the inadequacies of his metaphorical clay: his creations lack the breath of life, he admits, and so are only "idle enjoyment and play" (TeftLg a&amp;kkog xa i 3Tact6ba) unlike those of his model Prometheus (2). The point of this remark seems to have less to do with the "lifelessness" than with the instability of his clay figurines, since Lucian follows up by suggesting that his "play" will get him branded as another Kleon, the man whom a comic poet has referred to as a "Prometheus after the event [?eTd&amp; Taj Qdy aTa]." Unfortunately the comedy from which this remark de rives has been lost and we cannot be sure of its meaning,46 but Kleon's notorious habit of shifting ground so as to stay in the public eye seems the most likely 45. Profitability cannot be the main point of the joke, since Lucian, as a successful sophist, would have been making quite a bit of money himself. Nor can the remark be, as might be thought, a sly dig at the rampant bribery within the legal profession; Lucian's tone toward the friend he addresses here is always more cordial than this, since he treats the comment that occasioned the speech to be some form of praise (see Hall [supra n. 5] 455 n. 46). 46. Listed by Kock among the fragments of Eupolis (456), but only as one of the pseudepigra pha. Macleod (see note ad loc. in the OCT, Luciani Opera vol. 4) suggests a comparison with a fragment of Aristophanes (654), but the connection seems obscure to me. The translation "Monday morning quarterback" has been suggested.</page><page sequence="19">92 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 target. Clay offers Lucian an infinitely versatile medium, in which any creation can be instantly collapsed and remade, but for that very reason opens him up to charges of slipperiness and opportunism; his work can be made to follow facilely the tastes of the moment, like the protean career of Athens' most infamous demagogue. The pliability of clay is again equated with opportunism in the De Morte Peregrini, Lucian's portrait of Proteus Peregrine's self-immolation at the Olym pic festival of 164 A.D. Near the beginning of the piece, Theagenes, a devoted follower of Peregrine, is heard extolling his master before a gathering crowd of festival-goers: "Our age has seen only these two perfect creations, the Zeus of Olympia, and Proteus; their sculptors [rkaXdoraL] and artisans were, in the former case, Phidias, in the latter, nature" (6). At this point, an unnamed bystander (probably Lucian's own satiric mask) takes up the analogy, referring contemptu ously to Peregrine as an &amp;yakXa or votive statue, and as "that canon of Polycleitus" (i.e., the standard of perfection embodied by the Doryphoros). Then, commencing an impromptu biography of the changeling philosopher, Lu cian's speaker disdains to discuss Peregrine's early life: "I think it best to ignore all that material; for he was still unmolded clay [nq~.X6g yaQ EiTL &amp;akjXaog] then, the completed statue not yet having been crafted for us" (10).47 And indeed, Lucian's spokesman goes on to depict a number of different transformations,48 as Peregrine becomes, successively, a Christian sage, a Cynic wild man, a political revolutionary, and finally, a modern-day Heracles cremating himself in the pur suit of divinity. Peregrine too has been cast here as a "Prometheus after the event," a clay man whose lack of fixity is exposed all the more when contrasted with the steadfastness of ancient masterworks. Beyond its associations with shape-shifting and demagoguery, however, pli ability, whether in a man or a work of art, also presents the problem of imperma nence.49 Soft materials tend not to endure the test of time, whereas a work for the ages must be a monumentum aere perennius, harder than bronze. The imper manence of clay, which perhaps partly stands behind the remarks about "golden" oratory in the Prometheus Es, comes to the fore in the treatise Quomodo Historia Conscribenda Sit, Lucian's "how-to" pamphlet for writers of history. Lucian this time imagines himself an engineer rather than a sculptor, overseeing the historians as they construct their literary "edifice." However, while the builders themselves will carve the structure's epigraph, presumably in 47. Augustine similarly refers to his childhood self as unmolded clay at Conf. 1.11. 48. Indeed, the very first sentence of the piece emphasizes the infinite changeability of Pere grine, linking his adopted name, Proteus, with that of the insubstantial sea god of Homer's Odyssey. There is an interesting parallel here with Philostratus's Vita Apollonii Tyanae, which also begins by comparing its subject to Homer's Proteus (1.4) in respect of changeability. 49. The contrast between the impermanence of clay and the durability of stone and metal becomes more pointed when we recall that ancient sculptors were accustomed to model their subjects in wax or clay, materials that allowed for easy revision, before proceeding to the final stage of composition.

Like a child signing his name in wet cement, Lucian seems content with this transitory and undignified medium, yet realizes that it separates him from the historians who pursue the loftier goal of a Thucydidean XT-qla Eg acii or "posses sion for all time."50 But cannot clay, too, attain permanence and durability, when fired? Yes, but, as Lucian is keenly aware, the solidity of humble ceramics hardly compares with that of metal or stone; the baked pot, like the finely crafted rhetorical display, may be precious but is also highly perishable. Thus Lucian describes the Quomodo Historia Conscribenda Sit not only as words writ on clay but also as a clay jar, similar to the one Diogenes lived in at Corinth. Lucian vows to roll his "jar" up and down just as Diogenes, according to a famous anecdote, had done during preparations for a siege; but he worries that his own vessel is poorly baked and will shatter as soon as it hits the smallest stone (3). The complex analogy suggests that Lucian's chosen vehicle of expression, like Diogenes' bar rel roll, looks comically unimportant compared to the serious endeavors taking place around it, and will not hold up under the pressures of being taken seriously itself. Although the self-deprecation is partly a pose, it is significant that Lucian chooses the metaphor of baked clay in illustrating the inadequacies of his own treatise, before moving to the more affirmative example of wet AtiXog in the very next paragraph. A similar shift occurs in the Prometheus Es in Verbis, to return once again to that richly suggestive speech. Here Lucian, still turning over more facets of his friend's remark, suddenly departs from his consideration of wet clay and envi sions his creations as already "baked." Noting that Athenian potters and oven workers were once referred to as Prometheuses, he tells his addressee: "If this was the point of your 'Prometheus' remark, you've struck a bull's-eye, and revealed that Attic acerbity of your wit-for our works are as fragile [efiOQuxra] as were their pots, and someone could break them all by tossing a little stone at them" (2). We cannot tell from this brief analogy just what kind of stoning Lucian fears,51 but clearly he feels himself most vulnerable before his critics when he attempts to give his work a definitive, lasting outline, that is, by firing it. For a Promethean YrqXonr.dOog, fragility and frangibility, the qualities of the finished pot, impose rather serious limitations; to retain his most vital artistic powers he must keep his clay wet. The punning connection in the above example between Attic wit and Attic ware raises the further question of antiquarianism, which we have already seen 50. Longinus explicitly scorns this type of writing in De Subl. 14, where he claims that the author who shies away from composing for posterity will produce only &amp;TeXXj xai Tv(pa.6, "blind and useless works." 51. At the beginning of the Piscator, Lucian imagines his critics-in this case, the resurrected philosophers who have been the targets of his satire-pelting him with stones.</page><page sequence="21">94 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 explored by way of religious statuary in the Timon and the Zeus Tragoedus. If Lucian there uses the statue as a symbol of outmoded mythical traditions, does he here use the ceramic pot, in a similar way, to represent the stiffness of second century Atticism? Certainly the evidence of the Lexiphanes, a dialogue in which Lucian confronts antiquarianism in its most extreme form, suggests this is the case. Here Lucian attacks an empty-headed Atticizer who has not even read the authors he so self-consciously imitates (22): After you have plucked all the fairest flowers [of Classical literature], you will be a somebody in the world of letters; but as it is, you have unwittingly become like the objects shaped by the dollmakers for the marketplace: nicely colored with red and blue, but clayey and fragile [rXLXtvv6sg T xai EV'OQVxo;] on the inside. The showy archaism of Lexiphanes' style is described here as "fragile," EUOQVUTog, like Lucian's own "fired" pieces in the Prometheus Es; the clay that gives the rhetorician such artistic latitude evidently can become a liability when too "dry."52 In both works, moreover, this dryness seems to be associated, at least in part, with overzealous imitation of the old Attic dialect. Hardness, this time of stone rather than ceramic, is again linked to the remote past in the Rhetorum Praeceptor. Here Lucian adapts the agon of Aris tophanes' Clouds to his own milieu,53 offering the budding rhetorician a choice between traditional and modern varieties of training program. The teachers who represent these two schools are caricatured in much the same terms as Aristopha nes' Logos and Antilogos, the first tough and hardy, the second clever and effeminate, but Lucian goes much further than his predecessor in mocking the atavism of the former type. In one noteworthy passage, for instance, he de scribes a sculptural object lesson typically employed by the old-school rhetori cian (9): Then he will bid you emulate those men of olden times, putting forth stale [Foka] examples of argument that are not easy to imitate, just like the works of ancient artisanry, of Hegesias and the school of Kritias and Nesiotes: choked off, sinewy, hard, and closely measured in every con tour [&amp;ajeoqTPL^va xai vev@EQ6rl' xaoi oxXQCl xaQ axgL3[C g &amp; aOTeTateva Txtg yQataCLatS]. Where Lucian might have associated this figure with the mellow glory of a Phidias or a Praxiteles, he instead adduces this bleak assessment of the archaic 52. The analogy of the "dollmakers' (xoQonk(uOoL), which had been seen in a more positive light in the Prometheus Es (2), is here adduced as an insult. It is not clear exactly who these people were. Plato, whose interest in such minor arts is even greater than Lucian's, discusses them and the properties of their CntXog at Theaet. 147B-E. 53. Prodicus's "choice of Heracles" allegory (Xen. Mem. 2.1.21) and Hesiod's description of the two roads leading to virtue (Op. 287-92) also furnish models for the piece.</page><page sequence="22">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 95 style,54 thus underscoring the sterility and lifelessness of a rhetoric too much rooted in the past. Of course, the other participant in the debate, the slippery and superficial modernist, comes off looking just as bad (although there is no corresponding image drawn from "soft" sculpture in his portion of the agon). Lucian again steers a middle course between the esthetics of old and new, finding creative difficulties at both extremes: just as clay can become stiff and fragile when too dry or impermanent and shapeless when too wet, so the sophist's archetypes can imprison him within overly rigid confines or fail to give his work any shape whatever. Malleability, which lies somewhere between these poles, holds the key to success, whether in sculpture or in literature; the Promethean artist must reprocess his Classical models with just the right amount of elastic gum.55 At the same time Lucian uses hard and soft materials, in all the above examples, to configure another dilemma, involving the spirit in which the artist creates. We see him continually pondering the contrast between the playfulness (AabL6ta) that characterizes freestyle artistry and innovation, and the more seri ous approach that aims at a xxrl[a Eg aiei; stone-carving historians and goldsmith orators typify the latter breed of author, while Lucian himself takes the former role with his "fingertip" compositions. However, since the nErcta6beviEvol, whose approval alone can assure artistic survival, have no taste for whimsy, the question of play finds Lucian torn once again between longevity and popular appeal. His literary caprices, like the XO6vtLa y?g rcaL1beVraxa of the Zeus Tragoedus, are clever and irreverent but ultimately mortal as well; unlike more substantive works they will turn brittle and break if he "fires" them for posterity. The need to mediate between these poles of hard and soft artistry becomes a central concern in one of Lucian's more famous prolaliai, the Somnium sive Vita Luciani. In this speech, the last piece we shall examine, it is wax rather than clay that Lucian chooses as his most vital mode of expression, but the esthetic issues evoked by that choice are the same as those we have seen all along. In fact, wax, the softest and most impermanent of sculptural materials, brings out even more vividly than clay the problems faced by the Promethean artist,56 who attempts original creation in a culture dominated by traditional forms. 54. The passage has been interpreted in various ways. It seems impossible to me that Lucian's tone here is not at least mildly disparaging; but see Bliimner (supra n. 3) 5-7, and the sources cited there. Pollitt (supra n. 7: 82-83) observes that both Quintilian and Cicero describe the early evolu tion of Greek sculpture as a progression from "harder" to softer forms. 55. Dio Chrysostom has Phidias pose the same problem in the "Olympic" oration (12.69): "First we need a material substance, a material so tough that it will last, yet can be worked without much difficulty and consequently not easy to procure" (tr. J. W. Cohoon in the Loeb ed. [Dio Chrysostom II], who explains the passage in a note ad loc. as a contrast between coarse-grained marble, cheap but difficult to work, and the fine-grained, Pentelic variety). 56. Dio Chrysostom, enumerating the various media of plastic artistry, speaks of wax as the substance that "most easily conforms to craftsmanship, and is most receptive to changes of intention" (12.44).</page><page sequence="23">96 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 The Somnium, allegedly an autobiographical sketch, relates how Lucian, early in life, nearly became a sculptor rather than a sophist. The boy's would-be occupation is chosen for him in the following scene (2): My father looked over at my uncle-for my uncle on my mother's side was present, a man well esteemed as an excellent carver of herms-and said, "It's not right that any other trade should take precedence, when you're right here. Take this lad"-pointing to me-"and teach him to be a good stoneworker, a mason, and a carver of herms; he can do the job, for, as you know, he has a natural ability for it." He deduced this from my play [rncri&amp;cLg] with wax; for, whenever I was left alone by my teachers, I would scrape off the wax [sc. from my writing tablets] and sculpt cows, or horses, or even men, in a lifelike fashion, as my father judged. I got beaten for this by my teachers, but eventually I got praise as well, for my ingenuity; and from this modeling [jka-ccrxin] everyone had high hopes that I would learn the craft in a short time. Here Lucian has added a new level to the plastic metaphor developed out of the Promethean creation myth: the wax of the writing tablet is, after all, a literary as well as a sculptural medium, seeing that it would have contained the actual text of the ancient authors the young student was required to master. The episode of the wax figurines can thus be read not only as a charming autobiographical vignette, but as a portrait of the artist as a young man: by deforming the surface onto which his "junior classics" were frequently copied, Lucian acts out in minia ture the kind of artistic revision that would later distinguish his mature tech nique.57 Moreover, this exercise is again defined, as in the Prometheus Es, as play [ZaCLLda], and again serves to generate a menagerie of animal forms-mere cows and horses this time, rather than tragelaphs and hippocamps.58 In fact, Lucian accepts his father's choice precisely because he sees sculp ture as an opportunity for continued play, and, at the same time, as a chance to win acclaim from his peers: "By Zeus I was not unhappy with the career, since it seemed to hold the prospect of a rather amusing form of play [jnar6l v Tvca ovix &amp;axeQJ], and also for a grand display before my schoolmates" (3). Once apprenticed to his uncle the herm carver,59 however, the young artist quickly 57. Cf. Allison (supra n. 3) 26 f.: "It is tempting to imagine that [Lucian's] boyish efforts at mod elling issued in the keenness of perception and fidelity of outline characteristic of the literary artist." The same author comments on the word Xacrtotxig in the above passage: "This should perhaps be re membered as an element in Lucian's literary style" (Lucian: Selected Writings [Boston, 1905] 7; cf. xvi). 58. That these figurines are described as "realistic" (eixzorg) suggests that Lucian's madcap inventiveness is perhaps not yet fully developed. 59. Problems have been raised regarding the man's exact profession. A corrupt passage of text (2) identifies him as a Xtoo60og, a more general sort of stonemason, but the words in question are deleted by Macleod, following Schmieder. Moreover, W. E. Heitland (Luciani Somnium Charon Piscator et De Luctu [Cambridge, 1878] ad Somn. 12.5) questions whether eQooyXir'pog may share in the general meaning of "sculpture" that Lucian seems to have accorded to the noun feQtoyxk(ptx/ later in the speech.</page><page sequence="24">ROMM: Lucian as Plastic Artist 97 discovers that his mastery of wax does not translate into an equal versatility with stone (3): It happened then as often happens for beginners: handing me some chisel or other, my uncle told me to come down softly on a slab that was lying there, adding that hackneyed expression: "Well begun is half done." But I, inexperienced, brought the chisel down too hard, and the slab shattered; my uncle, seizing a rod lying nearby, put me through a rough and unenlightening initiation, so that tears became the prelude to my artisanship. Here again, the author's childhood adventures in sculpture symbolize his ongo ing dialogue with traditional classicism. The stone slab, in contrast to the pliant wax of the writing tablets, defines itself as fixed and "monolithic," like the Hesiodic apophthegm that characterizes the stonecarver uncle. Moreover, this slab is marked for transformation into a herm, that is, into a rigidly traditional object, whose power derives from its adherence to ancient canon.6 The herm carver's shop is the very headquarters, as it were, of the "hard" esthetic that strives to preserve sharp outlines and impermeable generic boundaries. Small wonder then that Lucian, whose artistry is still rooted in play, cracks the slab with the first blow of his chisel.61 The narrative of the Somnium now enters a celebrated dream sequence, in which two allegorical figures, Hermogluphike and Paideia, vie with one another for Lucian's allegiance; but the contest is decided from the start, when the former figure is introduced as "hard and manly" (oxX1Qd xacd &amp;av6b6qg). Like the herms that her craft produces, Hermogluphike configures in her rigidity a severe classicism that does not admit Lucian's metamorphic and playful tech niques. Moreover, the one appeal with which she might have won Lucian over the possibility of producing a xTl[La Eg aic--comes to naught (8): "Don't be put off by the humbleness of my appearance, or the dirtiness of my clothes. For it was after arising from such origins that Phidias himself displayed his Zeus, and Polycleitus created his Hera, and Myron won praise, and Praxiteles became a celebrity. These men are revered alongside the gods. If you join them, surely you too will be famous before all mankind." . . . The Craft spoke all this and more, stuttering the while and committing barbarous errors in her eagerness to put her 60. Art critics have often noted the extreme conservatism in Greek religious statuary, which tends to cling to its time-honored outlines in the same way as do religious rituals and utterances: see, e.g., A. W. Lawrence, Later Greek Sculpture and Its Influence on East and West (London, 1927) 42 44; Guy Dickins, Hellenistic Sculpture (Oxford, 1920) 85. 61. In fact Lucian may actually wish us to see him here not only as Prometheus, a remolder of archetypes, but as iconoclast, a smasher of idols: the destruction of a herm inevitably calls to mind the historical episode recounted by Thucydides (6.27-29, 60-61), in which traditional Athenian piety is badly shaken by this very event.</page><page sequence="25">98 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 1/April 1990 words together and persuade me. I don't even remember it any more; most of it's already forgotten. Even the example of Phidias fails to impress, if it is not accompanied by the fine dress and elegant speech that distinguish the successful rhetorician. The desire to produce a lasting masterwork has herein been wholly eclipsed by Lucian's more proximate goal, wide public acclaim; and as soon as Paideia holds out this glittering prize the contest is swiftly decided in her favor. As a result we have Lucian the Sophist, whose works miraculously attained an immortality he had not sought and for which he dared not hope.62 The agon between Paideia and Hermogluphike, then, takes place upon much the same field as other contests we have looked at herein: those between Zeus and Prometheus, between Polystratus and Lycinus, and between the two teachers of rhetoric in the Rhetorum Praeceptor. In each case, Lucian has framed the opposition as a debate over artistic materials and technique, contrasting hardness with softness, rigidity with fluidity, adherence to tradition with innova tion. In each case, moreover, Lucian clearly aligns himself with the latter set of qualities, yet remains aware, as he makes clear in the Prometheus Es and the Quomodo Historia Conscribenda Sit, of the price he pays for this choice: imper manence, critical disdain, exclusion from the canon. In fact he seems afraid, especially in the Zeuxis and the Prometheus Es, that the art based on j3aL6ta and JrXakcrrTX is in the last analysis a cheap form of xacvoTrig, a way of pandering to the tastes of the mob; but he is too enamored of public recognition to forsake his ludic mode. As he acknowledges in the final sentence of the Prometheus Es, his hybrid monsters may not recommend him very highly, but they are the mode of expression he has chosen, and he is stuck with them. In the end he remains what he was as a child, a shaper of clay, not a carver of marbles. Cornell University 62. Except, perhaps, in the Vera Historia, where Lucian claims (albeit ironically) to be striving to leave something behind for posterity (1.4). The story of how the satirist's works were shepherded through the Dark Ages by their Byzantine admirers, and later emerged to the West to spark an ebullient revival among the Renaissance humanists, is a fascinating one, best told by Robinson (supra n. 32: pt. 2) and by the introductory chapter of David Cast's The Calumny ofApelles: A Study in the Humanist Tradition (New Haven, 1981), which cites other useful sources. Lucian would no doubt have enjoyed the thought that the humanists would one day adopt him as a standard bearer in their struggle against the rigidities of Church dogma and Scholastic philosophy, in a manner not at all unlike his own adoption of Prometheus: see Duncan (supra n. 44) chap. 4. In fact, to carry this irony one step further, we note that Lucian's figurines have enjoyed much greater longevity than the sculptural colossi before which he felt so humbled; Phidias's Zeus eventually perished so completely as to leave no more substantial remains than the images struck on a few Hadrianic coins (see Ludwig Drees, Olympia: Gods, Artists, Athletes [New York, 1968] 145-49; Josef Liegle, Der Zeus des Phidias [Berlin, 1952] 114-31). In the end it was the stones that yielded first to the pressures of historical change.</page></plain_text>
