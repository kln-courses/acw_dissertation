<plain_text><page sequence="1">What Became Authentic Primitive Art? Shelly Errington University of California, Santa Cruz The category "Primitive Art" was invented at the turn of the 20th century and gained acceptance as "art," and, with it, monetary value, in the first half of the century-an inspiration to avant-garde artists, a pleasure to avant-garde collec- tors. By mid-century, it had begun to enter the mainstream of established art. It got its own museum in New York in 1954, when the Museum of Primitive Art was founded-funded by Nelson Rockefeller and containing largely his collec- tion. For about thirty years interest in "Primitive Art" grew. Public acceptance of it became more widespread; galleries selling it flourished; scholarly interest in it increased, and many new studies were made; curatorial interest grew, and new exhibits were installed. In 1984, Primitive Art seemed at the peak of its acceptance and validation, and with no fewer than five major exhibits of Primitive Art on show that winter in New York: Northwest Coast Art at the IBM gallery; Ashanti Gold at the American Museum of Natural History; African Masterpieces From the Musee de L'Homme at the newly established Museum of African Art; the permanent collection installed in the Rockefeller Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which had opened just two years before; and finally, the Museum of Modern Art's major and controversial production "Primitivism" in 20th Century Art. But the seminars, catalogues, critiques, reviews, and general publicity attending the conjunction of so much Primitive Art in the winter of 1984 revealed that the notion "Primitive Art," and the valorization of what was pronounced to be "authentic" Primitive Art by various authorities, had become far more controversial than the casual admirer of Primitive Art might have imagined. Most critiques focused on reexamining the issue of "authenticity," disput- ing the notion that "authentic" primitive people live as they have lived for cen- turies, untouched by Western civilization or history. The idea that authentic Primitive Art consists of objects made by "untouched" cultures for their own uses rather than for sale to "outsiders" and that these objects are pure in their form and content, uncontaminated by Western influence, has been thoroughly Cultural Anthropology 9(2):201-226. Copyright ? 1994, American Anthropological Association. 201</page><page sequence="2">202 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY criticized by Fabian (1983), Clifford (1988), Price (1989), Torgovnick (1990), and many others. Through such critiques, received notions of "authenticity" have been thoroughly discredited, and "primitivism" has been exposed as a Western ideological construct. Considerably less attention has been paid, however, to the third word in the term "authentic Primitive Art." Among the infinitude of objects considered both "authentic" and "primitive," only some of them were selected as "art" objects, their legitimacy institutionalized, and their monetary value as art established. To consider this issue requires a shift in focus from primitivism to art-to the deep schemata concerning "art" that inform the selection of some objects, but not most, to be designated (primitive) "art," and to the legitimizing museum processes that, in effect, pronounce them to be art. The Primitive Art in the Michael Rockefeller Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is what Malraux would call "art by metamorphosis" (1949). These artifacts began their existences as many different things-from ceremo- nial clubs to ancestral effigies, from door lintels to kava bowls. Their uses and functions in their contexts of production were various, but they were not "art," as they became in the Met. They have been moved great distances-from New Guinea, or Mesoamerica, or Africa-and have come to rest in New York City. Once in New York, they have continued their peripatetic existence. Over a pe- riod of decades, they have moved, some literally and some metaphorically, out of the American Museum of Natural History on the west side of Central Park, down to Midtown on 54th Street to the Museum of Primitive Art, and then up the other side of the park to the Met. These spatial movements parallel and help con- stitute their movements across categories. In what follows, I will examine what became "Authentic Primitive Art," using the Rockefeller Wing as a point of reference (see Figure 1). The Rockefel- ler Wing-the contents, its history of collection and exhibition, and its current installation-is paradigmatic of the meanings and fate of Authentic Primitive Art. For one thing, the objects in it exemplify and help constitute what I call High Primitive Art, the "authentic" Primitive Art that is valorized and exhibited in major museums and that commands the highest prices at auctions and in gal- leries. For another, the founding of the Museum of Primitive Art in 1954 and the opening of the Rockefeller Wing in 1982, both of which contained the same core collection, span the thirty-odd years in which Authentic Primitive Art was most accepted and valorized as a category of objects in museum exhibitions and in scholarship. This period can be seen as ending in 1984, when the Museum of Moder Art's show "Primitivism" in 20th Century Art provoked so much con- troversy that the erosion of the validity of the notion of Authentic Primitive Art became problematic, even to a general audience. Art by Intention and Art by Appropriation The vast majority of objects found in fine arts museums were not created as "art," not intended by their makers to be "art": they were originally other things. Andre Malraux addresses this fact, writing that many of the objects we count as</page><page sequence="3">WHAT BECAME AUTHENTIC PRIMITIVE ART? 203 Figure 1 Museum view.

"art" required a "metamorphosis" in order to become "art" (1949). These ob- jects are counted as "art" because they were claimed as such at certain historical moments. The term "metamorphosis," I think, seems entirely too gentle for some of the transformations that have taken place. While acknowledging the import of Malraux's writing on the topic, I want to distinguish here between art by appro- priation (rather than by metamorphosis) and art by intention.' Art by intention was made as art, created in contexts that had a concept of art approximating what we now hold: paradigmatically, the kinds of objects created in the Italian renaissance as art. Art by appropriation consists of the diverse objects that be- came "art" with the founding of public fine arts museums at the end of the 18th century. More and more objects gained status as art during the 19th century and entered the museum; one thinks especially of religious objects, like Byzantine icons and Christian triptychs, but there were many more. It is true, but obvious, that the objects in the Rockefeller Wing are "art by appropropriation." To say so only begins to open up the topic. What counts as a work of art? What attributes of the uncountable objects that humans have made predispose them to being selected as "art" objects? And how are these objects transformed by display, framing, and other practices into "art" objects?</page><page sequence="4">204 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY What Counts as a Work of Art? The assemblage of so many masterpieces in a museum, Andre Malraux wrote in Museum without Walls, conjures up in the mind's eye all the world's masterpieces. "How indeed could this truncated possible fail to evoke the whole gamut of the possible?" he asks."Of what is it [the museum] necessarily de- prived?" He answers: Of all that forms an integral part of a whole (stained glass, frescos); of all that cannot be moved; of objects such as sets of tapestry which are difficult to display; and, chiefly, of all that the collection is unable to acquire ... From the eighteenth to the twentieth century what migrated was the portable. [Malraux 1949:16] Relative to portability is size. Too small, and the item becomes insignifi- cant. Too large, and it becomes costly to transport and difficult to display. It is no mean feat to transport 30-foot carved poles from Irian Jaya to New York, and it requires a collector or museum both wealthy and determined enough to do it. To become "art" these portable objects must be displayed, and to be displayed they must be accommodated in a suitable space. Art was invented simultane- ously with collecting, and the two are inconceivable without each other. The market for monumental pieces is exceedingly limited, even if people praise them extravagantly as magnificent art. (Whose living room could accommodate an Olmec head-even if it could be bought?) Objects selected for display are best made of durable materials if they are to last. (If they are made of precious materials, like ivory or gold, all the better.) Many potential pieces of Primitive Art, made in the mainly tropical climates from which such pieces are drawn, are composed of soft materials or a combi- nation of soft and hard materials: flowers and woven palm-leaf offerings, bas- kets, bamboo, and bark-cloth. The more ephemeral material aspects of these items tend to disappear before they turn into "art." Those made of a combination of soft and hard parts are likely to lose the soft one, with profound epistemologi- cal and aesthetic consequences. It was standard practice among art dealers in the 1920s to strip African ar- tifacts of their soft and fibrous parts, rendering them starkly "modem" looking and preserving or creating a particular aesthetic (see Rubin 1984). One type of piece often treated that way is the "reliquary figure" from Gabon. The Center for African Art in New York displayed several of these pieces in the 1984 show Af- rican Masterpieces from the Musee de L'Homme, including one that retained its "basket decoration." The catalogue points out that "we usually see Kota reli- quary guardians stripped of their baskets and decorations, looking abstract, minimal, modern ... As seen here, where the bottom is inserted into its basket, the entire reading of the figure is radically changed." The catalogue continues with a spirited defense of the aesthetic of the basket, featuring the "complex tex- ture of twisted leather thongs and basketry [which] gives the base a restless vi- tality and interest," and the "feathers attached to the back of the head [which] further animate and complicate the figure's shape and texture," ending the para-</page><page sequence="5">WHAT BECAME AUTHENTIC PRIMITIVE ART? 205 graph with the wishfully triumphant proclamation that a "simple, minimal ob- ject has become a composite form-playing shapes, colors, and textures against each other" (Vogel and N'Diaye 1985:148, item 66). Maybe. But I suspect that, in spite of the restless vitality of rafia, the hier- archy of permanence will continue because it is overdetermined. Soft materials deteriorate, requiring special care (the few masks with leafy bases shown in the Rockefeller Wing are grouped together in temperature-controlled cases); they may look messy on a coffee table; their commodity value, as well as their dis- play value, is lessened if they deteriorate. Perhaps most deeply, there is an unstated and largely unconscious link in the West between the permanent and the civilized, the durable and "high" civi- lization and arts, made explicit, handily enough, by Sir Kenneth Clark in Civi- lisation (1970). He regards the urge toward permanence and the (alleged) cor- relative urge toward making objects of permanent materials to be a hallmark of the civilized. According to Clark, civilized societies show themselves to be such by locating themselves within history, partly by making objects that endure: Civilization means something more than energy and will and creative power.... How can I define it? Well, very shortly, a sense of permanence. The wanderers and invaders were in a continual state of flux. ... And for that reason it didn't occur to them to build stone houses, or to write books.... Almost the only stone building that has survived from the centuries after the Mausoleum of Theodoric is the Baptistry at Poitiers. It is pitifully crude.... But at least this miserable construction is meant to last. It isn't just a wigwam. Civilized man, or so it seems to me, must feel that he belongs somewhere in space and time; that he consciously looks forward and looks back. [Clark 1970:16-17] In a few sentences he equates civilization, sedentary existence (read: agri- culture rather than hunting, gathering, or nomadic pastoralism), permanent structures (and by extrapolation other objects that are made to last-not wig- wams!), and a sense of history, of locating oneself in time. Although the objects in the Rockefeller Wing would probably be dismissed out of hand by Clark and by most art historical students under the sway of the Italian renaissance-in- deed, that was part of the problem the Rockefellers had in getting Primitive Art into the Met in the first place-it is no accident that the ones chosen here are among the most enduring. They are at least on the road to permanence, which is more than can be said about a piece of music or a sand-painting, or even a basket or an intricately woven leaf and flower offering. The importance of portability and durability as criteria of art is confirmed if we look at the practices that have produced "modern" forms of non-Western arts derived from prior, evanescent art-forms. One example is that of Navajo sand-paintings. Navajos made intricate designs in the sand, which, in the course of the curing ceremony, were sat upon and stepped on, hence erased. In the course of this century, various people had the idea of preserving the designs, first by painting them, and eventually by applying sand to a board with a thin coating of glue. At that point the designs became both durable and portable, able to be moved to new locations (collected and sold) and hung on walls as "art"</page><page sequence="6">206 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY (Parezo 1983). Something analogous happened among the Australian Aborigi- nes, who draw ancestral designs in the sand, paint them on bodies, and paint and incise them on bark, rocks, and a few other materials. Only those on permanent materials (rocks and bark) are kept between ceremonies, often hidden from view in caves and other secret stashing-places. For a number of decades bark paint- ings stood as "Aboriginal art" and were sold as such in shops in Sydney and Can- berra. But Aboriginal art really gained a market and a place in the world art scene when Aborigines began painting ancestral designs in acrylic on canvas. (See Williams 1976, Sutton 1988, and Morphy 1991.) Art by intention-those objects, paradigmatically framed paintings, that were created in order to be sold, collected, and hung on silent walls-is also portable by intent. Its portability greatly facilitates its collectability and its abil- ity to be commodified. Durability also makes its collection, display, and com- modification more convenient than would otherwise be the case. (One need not ask which came first, art's durability or its commodifiability, to acknowledge the convenient correlation.) Primitive Art, then, is usually the size and durability that money can trans- port, dealers can store, and collectors can conveniently display. Thus a hierar- chy of Primitive Art substances emerges, in which Benin bronzes, ivory masks, and hardwood sculptural forms predominate over ritual figures made of leaves, disintegrating fabric, deteriorating tapa cloth, fraying baskets, breakable pot- tery. Framing "Art" Art by intention is framed, literally or figuratively. We owe the literal frame, which is derived from the wooden triptych, to the Renaissance invention of portable, salable canvases that needed protection. The literal frame increases the portability, durability, hence commodifiability, of the object.2 The 18th century took the idea of framing further than the literal frame by distinguishing "art" from "craft" and separating the "fine arts" into five types: painting, sculpture, architecture, music, and dance.3 M.H. Abrams traces the so- cial practices in the 18th century that separated "art" from life, ending in Kant's articulation of the theory of the purely aesthetic object with no useful function but to be contemplated (1985). By the end of that century, then, all five "fine arts" became useless, contemplatable objects and required the frame-whether a picture frame, a pedestal, or a stage-to function as a boundary between the piece of "art" and the world, setting off art from everyday life, from social con- text, and from mundane utility. The frame pronounces what it encloses to be not "real" life but something different from it, a representation of reality. Thus, at the end of the 18th and first part of the 19th century, music and dance, which are activities, were turned into "aesthetic" objects by framing them (by the stage or platform) and separating them from the audience, who then contemplated them as distant spectacles, as the art connoisseur contemplated the painting on the wall. The audience does not participate in the performance but only views it.</page><page sequence="7">WHAT BECAME AUTHENTIC PRIMITIVE ART? 207 Art by appropriation, by contrast, is not born in a frame, so to speak. It be- comes "art" by being framed, by being removed from a context of use and per- formance. Here it is worth remarking that, although not all human societies have produced what I would call art (at least when being meticulous, I would prefer to confine the word to objects conforming to the cluster of associations and prac- tices articulated at the end of the 18th century in Europe), all human cultures have what Cassirer called "symbolic form": artifacts, activities, or even aspects of the landscape that humans view as densely meaningful (1955). Further, hu- man beings have several sensory capacities: we see, hear, taste, smell, touch, and have "haptic" or "kinesthetic" empathetic capacities. Very few symbolic forms are cast in a single sensory medium: an audience hears drumbeats while looking at masked dancers and perceiving their movements with kinesthetic em- pathy; people doze and smoke clove cigarettes and munch on snacks while sit- ting in front of shadow puppets and hearing gamelan music. Only mechanical reproduction allows us to separate our sensory modalities and utilize a single ca- pacity to listen to a symphony while we wash dishes. But some of the multiple media in which non-mechanically-replicated symbolic forms are cast are tem- porally evanescent; sounds, smells, tastes, muscular exertion, and kinesthetic empathy do not last. Masks and all the rest of these objects slough off their eva- nescent performance contexts on the way to New York, retaining only the dura- ble part that can be set aside in a frame or on a pedestal. By the time they become Primitive Art, then, the mask and the ancestor figure look a lot more like "sculp- ture" than like something that needs a performance to activate its meanings. Sculptural Qualities Even now, painting and sculpture stand as the epitome of "fine arts" for both museum curators and museum-goers-in spite of the eclectic and universal nature of art in the late 20th century. Certainly at the time that Primitive Art was being discovered or invented at the turn of the 20th century, prior to Duchamp, Cristo, and suchlike, the two forms were paradigmatic. Painters and sculptors were the ones who discovered Primitive Art and used it for inspiration. Regarded as a deep schema, paradigm, or pattern rather than as an already obvious object, a "painting" is a portable, flat, four-cornered thing with some iconic content. Such objects are relatively rare in the history of the world. Per- sian miniatures and Japanese and Chinese brush-paintings and screens are the closest candidates to approximate this schema outside the Western tradition, and it cannot be an accident that those items have long entered dealership circles as "high" forms of non-European art. The peoples of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas-the regions that pro- duced what became Primitive Art-created very few objects corresponding to that schema. They did produce, however, three-dimensional objects in durable materials that can be grafted fairly easily onto the schema of sculpture, the sec- ond paradigmatic form of fine art. It can be no accident that the vast majority of objects exhibited in the Rockefeller Wing and other fine arts museums can pass for (and "pass as") "sculpture."</page><page sequence="8">208 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY Iconicity A feature of both painting and sculpture in the Renaissance canon was a special form of iconic signification. The Italian renaissance reinvented and ra- tionalized a certain type of iconic signification, perspectival illusionistic real- ism, what Summers calls "optical naturalism" (1987), or the geometrical repre- sentation of virtual space. Considered in the context of the history of the world, optical naturalism is a peculiar type of iconicity: it attempts to depict precisely the way something looks.4 Between the 15th and 18th centuries, optical natural- ism emerged and crystallized as part of the definition of "art" in Europe. In the 19th century, objects that had a recognizable iconic content but yet fell short of the optical naturalism achieved in academic painting were called "primitive"- including everything from the Italian "primitives" (primitive because prior to the full rationalization of perspectival techniques), to the Douanier Henri Rous- seau (primitive because not academically trained), to Japanese prints (primitive because not sufficiently optically, perspectivally realistic). What eventually be- came Primitive Art in the 20th century was simply grotesque in the 19th. The niche of the primitive in art was occupied by others. That space began to be occupied by l'art negre (African art) at the turn of the 20th century, when the Renaissance canon appeared to collapse completely, admitting as art the "distortions" to optical naturalism represented by cubism and African masks. Curiously enough, it did not collapse entirely. A vitiated or updated version of optical naturalism remained a part of the criterion of what is allowed to count as art: that is iconicity, pure and simple. Objects from Africa, Oceania, and the Americas that resemble something recognizable-most nota- bly, a person, a person's face, or an animal-are more likely to become Primi- tive Art than are objects that are "decorated," even beautifully, but have little or no iconic content.5 The criterion of iconicity intruded legally in the 1930s, concerning more than just Primitive Art, according to an anecdote that appears in Russell Lynes's Gold Old Modern (1973). It seems that the Museum of Modern Art was trying to import abstract European sculpture for a show on modern art. But as Lynes explains, according to Paragraph 1807 of the Tariff Act and a definition made in 1930, sculpture to be imported as "art," rather than as either raw material or utili- tarian objects (on which there was a 40 percent duty), had to be "imitations of natural objects, chiefly of the human form... in their true proportion of length, breadth and thickness" (Lynes 1973:138). Apparently sculptures by Giacometti, Arp, Miro, and other modernist artists at the time did not qualify. The previous year the museum had had a similar problem with Primitive Art, but in that case it was compounded by the fact that several of the items were declared utilitarian or worse.6 Iconicity remains an unstated and even repressed criterion for the identifi- cation of what counts as art. This is still the case today, even after the advent of objets trouves, abstract expressionism, and so forth. The catalogue Master- pieces of Primitive Art, published when the Museum of Primitive Art collection moved into the Met, for instance, is organized by dividing the objects into faces,</page><page sequence="9">WHAT BECAME AUTHENTIC PRIMITIVE ART? 209 figures, animals, and abstractions (Newton 1978). This organization asks the viewer to see these objects as representations, as though these objects' meanings lay primarily in their iconic content-revealed especially in the residual cate- gory, "abstractions." Or note the two-page spread in the New York Times Maga- zine of September 20, 1987, advertising an exhibit at the Center for African Art, New York, by its sponsor Philip Morris. It asks, "What are you looking at?" and features five pieces of Primitive Art selected from one hundred in the show; all five are clearly recognizable as sculptural anthropomorphic figures. Iconicity is the hidden specter that continues to haunt Primitive Art: it is not absolute, but it lurks at the edges of collecting and categorization. Much com- mentary on non-Western arts, for instance, calls them "stylized" or "abstract," terms that make sense only if one imagines that the natural or obvious way to de- pict the world is in a style of optical naturalism. This observation is as true of an- thropologists as it is of art historians and museum curators, with very few (but enlightening) exceptions. I offer two illustrations. Bill Holm, retired curator of the Burke Museum in Seattle, for instance, has written a useful book on how designs are made and applied by stencil to items like blankets, totem poles, hats, bracelets, and so forth, in Northwest Coast American arts. In a section called "Degree of Realism," he divides designs into three types, depending on whether the animal parts remain of a piece, very little distorted or separated ("configurative"), or are distorted and split somewhat, but still recognizable ("expansive"), or finally are "so distorted it that it is difficult or impossible to identify the abstracted animal or the exact symbolism of the parts" ("distributive") (Holm 1965:13). Holm's categories may be useful for some purposes, but even to raise "degrees of realism" as an issue suggests that readers share an implicit notion that art is primarily mimetic. His categories, in turn, are loosely based on Boas's classification in Primitive Art (1955[1927]), which divided Northwest Coast art into "symbolic" (because it stood for or re- ferred to something outside itself) and "decorative" (which he characterized as "meaningless," because it did not apparently refer to something outside itself). Here is a second example. In the 1984 exhibition "Primitivism" in 20th Century Art at the Museum of Modern Art (hereafter, MoMA) in New York, Giacometti's Tall Figure (1949) was juxtaposed with an elongated figure from Nyamwezi, the label claiming that both of them "rejected realism." The label makes no sense as a historical statement: how could one of the pair reject realism when its makers never tried to achieve realism in the first place? The only way that sense can be made of it is if we recognize the implicit assumption, a very deep one in Western art-thought, that art seeks to make optically naturalistic copies of "reality." If some African artifact is really art, it also, ipso facto, seeks to imitate reality. If it does not, it must be because the artist rejected his self-evi- dent mission "rejecting realism." In short, the naturalistic prejudice-the idea that art (whether flat or in the round) is made meaningful by resembling something in the world and that it strives to do so in a way as optically realistic as possible, even if it does not al- ways achieve it-is very deep. In the 19th century, at least a degree of optical</page><page sequence="10">210 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY naturalism formed the explicit or implicit criterion by which a non-European image or artifact was judged to be art at all and, if it was, its quality or type. In the 20th, anthropomorphic and recognizable objects are chosen as art over those that are not: a mask, with eyes and mouth, is more paradigmantically "primitive art" than is a slit gong or a kava bowl, however ritually meaningful they might have been and however smooth, elegant, and therefore "modem" their lines. I think it possible that the domination of the mimetic theory of meaning within the discipline of art history-that something means by representing something outside itself and that its mode of reference is iconic, which in turn constitutes the object as a mere representation or model of the world rather than as part of the world-is due to the dominance of Renaissance studies within the Anglophone world, especially as formulated by Panofsky (1955). Meaning, he wrote in his well-known article on the subject, can be preiconic, iconographic, and iconologic. Paintings' iconic contents, in turn, are illustrations of prior texts. And yet, if an object's meaning is signified otherwise than through the iconic function, the whole method of interpretation, taught to generations of art history students, collapses. Thus one might explain the difficulty of conven- tional art history as a discipline in dealing with 20th-century Western arts, pre- Renaissance arts, and non-Western arts generally, all of which may have iconic content but very few of which imagine themselves to be primarily about mime- sis. In any case, the mad search for iconic meaning in Primitive Art was brought home to me in December 1984 when I took the docent tour of the Rocke- feller Wing and the docent and I came upon a horizontally long object with a beak of sorts.7 This, the docent said, was a "butterfly mask." Their art is very so- phisticated, she said, but it is entrenched in traditional wisdom. This butterfly mask is well carved and painted, and we think it was used in initiation rites in the spring. Why, she asked rhetorically, is it in the shape of a butterfly? She said that we do not know, but thinks that it might have been to welcome spring. I objected that it has a beak; how do we know it is a butterfly? That is not all there is to it, she continued: its intention was not to make something look like a butterfly: their art is conceptual, it is about invisible con- cepts. For instance, she said, moving to a case with a carved male and female fig- ure from Dogon, this is a primordial couple (.. . and note the long, cylindrical slender shapes characteristic of the style of the western Sudan). The man carries a quiver, and the woman has a baby on her back. That shows that he is the pro- genitor, she the nurturer. Moreover, his hand is holding his penis and his other arm is around her. They had no writing, but by means of such statues they were able to express invisible concepts like the cooperation between the sexes. I wondered what spring was like in the Sudan,8 and what sorts of concepts were not invisible, but even that was way ahead of me. That first object did not look like a butterfly to me; in fact, I was not sure it was a mask. It reminded me of the old joke, "if I had some ham, I could have some ham and eggs, if I had some eggs": if it is a butterfly, it is a splendid example of a butterfly mask, if it is a mask. But then again, perhaps it is a bat, and then what would one make of</page><page sequence="11">WHAT BECAME AUTHENTIC PRIMITIVE ART? 211 it? And why, I wonder, does it have a beak? Unless the beak really represents a penis, in which case it is well on its way to being a visual representation of the invisible concept of "the cooperation between the sexes." This mask (if it is a mask) is a particularly beautiful and well-executed carving of a butterfly with a beak; conversely and alternatively, it is a singularly poor rendition of a bat. Higher Realities In a witty passage that addresses the question of what becomes Primitive Art, Arthur Danto explicitly rejects the idea that formal qualities alone make an object into art. To make this point he imagines two tribes, the Pot People and the Basket People, who make identical pots and baskets. But Pot People invest pots with a great deal of meaning, which Danto writes about with ingenious and amusing detail. "Lying at the cross point of art, philosophy, and religion," he concludes the passage, "the pots of the Pot People belong to Absolute Spirit. Their baskets, tightly woven to insure sustained utility, are drab components in the Prose of the World" (Danto 1988:24). The opposite is true of the Basket Peo- ple, of course. In sum, "artifacts" consist of "objects whose meaning is ex- hausted in their utility.... They are what they are used for, but artworks have some higher role, putting us in touch with higher realities; they are defined through their possession of meaning" (Danto 1988:31). Happily for Danto's point, a very large proportion of the objects in the Rockefeller Wing have "ceremonial" uses in their original contexts, such as an- cestor poles from the Pacific, totem poles from the northwest coast of America, and masks and reliquary figures from Africa. Objects such as these have "uses" and "functions" in their own societies, but those functions are outside our expe- rience of usefulness and can therefore be grafted onto the sacred-useless cate- gory of art with more ease than can objects like cooking pots or grain grinders. Everyday functional items are for the most part left out. (Of course there is an occasional exquisite ladle, reminiscent of a Brancusi in its radical simplicity.) Here is a selection of labels from artifacts in the Rockefeller Wing: The Asmat celebrated death with feasts and rituals that both commemorated the dead and incited the living to avenge them. Dogon figures with raised arms "allude to the communion between heaven and earth. The sculptures sometimes wear pendants, representing covenant stones that identify priests of totemic ancestor cults. Large containers often with a horse's head and tail are used to hold sacrificial meat during annual ceremonies commemorating the Dogon myth of creation." Nowhere is the complexity and variety of Kuba design more apparent than in the plush textiles that men and women of high rank wear as wrapped skirts on ceremonial occasions. Fijian clubs, "favored weapons in the 19th century," were "intended to shatter the skulls thus not only causing death but insulting the sacred part of the body."</page><page sequence="12">212 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY From the Solomon islands, "the finest examples of shell-work are certain cere- monial shields, a small number of which were made in a brief period in the 19th century." The terms "ceremony," "ritual," "rite," "initiation," "sacred," "sacrificial," "ancestor," and "totemic" occur again and again in Rockefeller Wing labels; the objects chosen for display are overwhelmingly "ceremonial" objects. If some- thing apparently utilitarian is displayed, such as a bowl, it is almost inevitably a "ceremonial bowl," as likely as not used by high-status people. I was interested to note that the museum labels and the catalogue of MoMA's 1984 "Primitiv- ism" in 20th Century Art" show even used the completely discredited term "fet- ish." (Curiously enough, a very similar figure to the one in the Primitivism show labeled a "fetish" appeared in the show going on concurrently at the Center for African Art; but there it was called an "oath-taking figure.") Nowadays, I would have thought, the term is confined to department stores, such as a display I came upon in Gump's in San Francisco selling "Zuni Fetishes-In The Traditional Fetish Style." Ritual objects, high status, and rarity all tend to imply each other in the labels of High Primitive Art. There is no reason to suppose that these labels are incorrect or even really misleading-although these days anthropologists seldom use terms like totemic ancestor cults, as though what totemic means and what ancestor cult means were transparent, which they are not. My point, rather, is that these objects are drawn overwhelmingly from the realm of the "sacred" as contrasted to the "secular," a Durkheimian dichotomy that, once more, has little currency in mod- ern anthropology. Then, too, the lack of cultural specificity of the labels, the use only of English-language terms (ritual, ceremony, initiation, etc.) and the failure to explicate the purposes and sociology of these "ceremonies" (initiation into what? by whom and for whom? ritual in order to do what?) leave the casual visi- tor with the distinct impression that "Primitive Man" is obsessed with ritual or, at least, that Primitive Art expresses higher realities. Part of the reasoning that underlies the selection of ritual objects as art rather than more mundane items, it seems probable, is the 18th-century distinc- tion between mere craft and high art. Applied to the selection of non-Western objects, the distinction between high art and utilitarian craft tends to mean that obviously functional items (especially if they are undecorated) do not qualify as art. It was gratifying to see the distinction between art and non-art spelled out explicitly at the Field Museum in Chicago. An exhibit case near the entrance to the ethnographic rooms I saw in 1986 (since removed) was divided into three sections: "Art," featuring a decorated ritual object; "Decorative Art," featuring a decorated bowl; and (miserable thing) "Non-Art," featuring a rather straight- forward-looking undecorated stone ax. "Art" was described like this: Art objects differ from society to society, but they tend to be concerned with making visible the supernatural and the intangible. In so doing, art may render more manageable some of the terrors and uncertainties of life.</page><page sequence="13">WHAT BECAME AUTHENTIC PRIMITIVE ART? 213 The selection of ritual objects over utilitarian ones as Primitive Art is un- doubtedly multiply determined. For one thing, ritual use links an object to the transcendent, a way that art in general (not just Primitive Art) is validated rhe- torically. For another, art and craft were separated from each other at the end of the 18th century, and anything with an immediately obvious utilitarian use runs the risk of being categorized as mere "craft," whereas objects used for ceremo- nial purposes from other traditions, by contrast, appear nonutilitarian to us and are more likely to be regarded as transcendent, therefore making them into the category "art." And finally, the talk about "higher realities" shades off into the talk that has been characterized as "primitivism." One of the most common ways we talk about Primitive Art is by talking about the primitive, a word and concept that has different valences in different eras. In her book Primitive Art in Civilized Places (1989), Sally Price asks, "How do we talk about primitive art?" and, in a chapter she calls "The Night Side of Man," states that the notion that "Primitive Man" fears the elements and terrifying spirits is very deep in art talk about Primitive Art. I do not doubt it-in fact, evidence to that effect crops up everywhere-but it is also worth noting that art talk about "the primitive" is not monolithic. Many of the quotations in Price's book are drawn from the writings of people whose sensibilities concern- ing "the primitive" were formed between the two world wars, when most of Af- rica and Oceania was still colonized and when the notion of Primitive Art was still being formed and institutionalized in museum shows. This view of Primi- tives-that they fear the unknown, and through their art they both express their superstitions and exorcise their demons-has its origins, I believe, in 19th-cen- tury horror at the grotesque pagan rituals that were observed among the colo- nized. It is probably very basic to the invention of the non-Western artifact as art; it was there at its inception, when Pablo Picasso was inspired not-he in- sisted (at least in this quote)-by these objects' formal characteristics but by their magical power. He says: They were against everything-against unknown threatening spirits.... I, too, I am against everything. I, too, believe that everything is unknown, that everything is an enemy! ... women, children . .. the whole of it! I understood what the Negroes used their sculptures for. ... All fetishes . . . were weapons. To help people avoid coming under the influence of spirits again, to help them become independent. Spirits, the unconscious ... they are all the same thing. I understood why I was a painter. All alone in that awful museum with the masks ... the dusty mannequins. Les Demoiselles d'Avignon must have been born that day, but not at all because of the forms; because it was my first exorcism painting-yes abso- lutely! [Malraux 1976:5] The view that Primitive Man is obsessed with fear and irrational supersti- tion and that their arts express it is reflected in the following passages by Ken- neth Clark and by Thomas McEvilley, which Price quotes. Juxtaposing pictures of the head of the Apollo Belvedere and something labeled merely "African mask," Clark makes this comment in his book Civilisation:</page><page sequence="14">214 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY An even more extreme example comes to mind, of an African mask that belonged to Roger Fry. I remember when he bought it and hung it up, and we agreed that it had all the qualities of a great work of art. I fancy that most people, nowadays, would find it more moving than the head of the Apollo of the Belvedere. Yet for four hundred years after it was discovered, the Apollo was the most admired piece of scupture in the world.... Whatever its merits as a work of art, I don't think there's any doubt that the Apollo embodies a higher state of civilization than the mask. They both represent spirits, messengers from another world-that is to say, from a world of our imagining. To the Negro imagination it is a world of fear and darkness, ready to inflict horrible punishment for the smallest infringement of a taboo. To the Hellenistic imagination, it is a world of light and confidence, in which the gods are like ourselves, only more beautiful, and descend to earth in order to teach men reason and the laws of harmony. [Clark 1979:2, quoted in Price 1989] Lest one imagine that this view of Primitive Art, and with it Primitive Man, is completely outdated, it is worth reading McEvilley's 1984 critical review of the 1984 MoMA exhibit "Primitivism" in 20th Century Art. In it McEvilley cas- tigates Rubin and Varnadoe, the curators responsible for the show, for appropri- ating these artifacts as art rather than what they "really" are, religious artifacts; he suggests that they should have been provided with ethnographic context that reveals them as such. He tells us what he thinks Primitive Man's religion is in this remarkable passage: In their native contexts these objects were invested with feelings of awe and dread, not of aesthetic ennoblement. They were seen usually in motion, at night, in closed dark spaces, by flickering torchlight. Their viewers were under the influence of ritual, communal identification feelings, and often alcohol or drugs; above all, they were activated by the presence within or among the objects themselves of the shaman, acting out of the usually terrifying power represented by the mask or icon. What was at stake for the viewer was not aesthetic appreciation but loss of self in identification with and support of the shamanic performance. [McEvilley 1984:59, quoted in Price 1989] Nonetheless, it is my impression that this strand of primitivism is not the most prevalent one in the United States in the 1990s, in which the voices pro- moting Primitive Art (and of course its descendants, ethnic arts and tribal arts of various sorts) sound increasingly New Age. The more dominant primitivism in popular culture in the late 20th century, it seems to me, is a much softer primi- tivism. Rather than imagining drug-besotted natives dancing around flickering fires and terrified of the spirits, it imagines an ecologically conscious people liv- ing in harmony with nature and, sometimes, worshiping their version of the god- dess. I call this version New Age primitivism. It is practiced by people who visit Egyptian and Mesoamerican pyramids and Stonehenge in order to collect the cosmic rays that gather there, and by those who conduct rituals in the kivas of Pueblo Indians in the Southwest (much to the latter's annoyance), and so forth. And, of course, many people who in other aspects of their lives are not particu- larly New Age are also deeply interested in the "primitive" and the "authentic" and are interested in buying and collecting its tokens.</page><page sequence="15">WHAT BECAME AUTHENTIC PRIMITIVE ART? 215 It seems to me that these attitudes-the one that views Primitive Man as ob- sessed with ritual and terrified of spirits, and the one that views Primitive Man as living harmoniously with nature and as in touch with higher realities-are each other's flip sides. Both should be called primitivism because both make the same moves that Edward Said implied were characteristic of "orientalism": the moves of dichotomizing, otherizing, and essentializing (1979). It is their imagined or presumed link with the "higher" realites (Absolute Spirit, or Cosmic Energy, or Gaia, or The Goddess) that allows some objects, even from places far from the Renaissance in space and time, to be claimed as art. Formal Qualities, or Does It Look Modern? A great many objects and sorts of objects have been displayed, collected, sold, and valued by individuals as Primitive Art. Historically (between the two world wars and in the 1950s) and in art-historical and art-museum circles, one of the most important ways of talking about, hence selecting, certain kinds of objects over others to become Authentic Primitive Art was their "formal quali- ties." In practice this could not help but mean, more or less (but usually more), how closely they approximated the formal qualities, the "look," of high modern- ist art. The discourse of formal qualities claims these objects as valuable "aes- thetically," divorced from any of their uses or meanings in the societies that pro- duced them. This point of view is well known and is insistently articulated in pre-World War II MoMA exhibits of non-Western artifacts. The catalogue of MoMA's 1935 exhibit African Negro Art was a paean of praise to the formal plastic qualities of African (read: modern) art. In his concluding paragraph to this catalogue, James Johnson Sweeney asserts that, taking into account any- thing at all about the history, cultures, or contexts that produced African art is positively dangerous-a more clear and present danger to us, since we know more than Picasso did about African cultures: In the end, it is not the tribal characteristics of Negro art nor its strangeness that are interesting. It is its plastic qualities. Picturesque or exotic features as well as historical and ethnographic considerations have a tendency to blind us to its true worth. This was realized at once by its earliest amateurs. Today with the advances we have made during the last thirty years in our knowledge of Africa, it has become an even graver danger. Our approach must be held conscientiously in another direction. It is the vitality of the forms of Negro art that should speak to us, the simplification without impoverishment, the unnerving emphasis on the essential, the consistent, three-dimensional organization of structural planes in architectomic sequences, the uncompromising truth to material with a seemingly intuitive adaptation of it, and the tension achieved between the idea or emotion to be expressed through representation and the abstract principles of scupture. The art of Negro Africa is a sculptor's art. As a sculptural tradition in the last century it has no rival. It is as sculpture we should approach it. [Sweeney 1935:11 ] A few years later, different authors emphasize the same theme. From the catalogue for the exhibit Indian Art of the United States, MoMA, 1941:</page><page sequence="16">216 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY In theory, it should be possible to arrive at a satisfactory aesthetic evaluation of the art of any group without being much concerned with its cultural background. A satisfactory organization of lines, spaces, forms, shades and colors should be self-evident wherever we find it. [Douglas and D'Harnoncourt 1941:11] (They go on to explain that in practice, however, we are saved from many errors by knowing something about the culture that produced the object. For a more complete account of this exhibit, see Rushing 1992.) An object's formal qualities (how closely it approaches a modernist aes- thetic) persist as criteria that filter High Primitive Art from crafts, however "authentic" the latter may be. Take, for instance, the two pieces of jewelry shown in Figure 2-both of them chest ornaments, both made of gold, both from Sumba, Indonesia. One is much more memorable as art than the other, which looks simply like a gold chest ornament. See also the postcards in Figure 3 an- nouncing exhibitions in one of San Francisco's "best" galleries of "art of Africa, Oceania &amp; the Americas." One of them construes the shield as a "canvas," the other concerns "the vertical" in "tribal composition." A decorated ritual object that has become High Primitive Art has two rele- vant qualities: its participation in the sacred and its formal plastic qualities (to use art-talk). And indeed non-Western objects entered the realm of Primitive Art by two roads: by their formal aesthetic qualities, or by their expressiveness of shamanistic exorcistic power. In practice, these two are often merged in the same objects: it is no accident that the mask, reliquary figure, or totemic ances- tor figure stand as paradigmatic examples of the highest, most Authentic Primi- tive Art.

A case study in High Primitive Art and the notions of "authenticity" in the "primitive" that surrounded it occurred in the most interesting and controversial show of Primitive Art in the last several decades. It was the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition "Primitivism" in 20th Century Art, which took place in 1984, organized by William Rubin and Kirk Varnedoe. It merged these two readings, formalist and mystical, depending on whether one read the show backwards or forwards. (That was not, of course, its stated intent.) It was laid out in three ar- eas, which the visitor passed through sequentially. The first area showed what</page><page sequence="18">218 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY I have called High Primitive Art-the pieces, or ones like them, that influenced the cubists and surrealists. The second area was a large room called "Affinities," where examples of Primitive Art were juxtaposed with examples of modem art; the primitive and the modem of each pair revealed a presumably remarkable and strange affinity with its opposite. The last room was called "Modem Primitives" and consisted of the work of contemporary Western artists who are influenced by the Primitive. The exhibit's stated intent was to reveal the connections between Primitive Art and the modernists, most especially Picasso. Entering the exhibit, the visitor could read a plaque with a rather defensive message from William Rubin insist- ing that the exhibit was not, after all, about Primitive Art in its ethnographic con- text but about its importance to modern art and modern artists. Rubin's qualifi- cation is, in my view, entirely legitimate, for there is no reason whatsoever to insist that these objects must be understood within their cultural context if one is interested in their meanings to cubists and surrealists. A social history of primitivism in 20th-century art would have been fascinating. But that was not, in fact, what the exhibit was about. The first part of the show was about how the formal qualities of African ar- tifacts made them appealing to cubists, while Oceanic artifacts appealed to sur- realists. The voice-over of museum labels was insistently formalist: a Melane- sian object explored "negative space" with great sophistication; another piece revealed "frontal symmetry." The exhibit's middle section, "Affinities," paired various non-Western ar- tifacts with European 20th-century objects reminiscent of them in formal terms. Depleted of historicity, anything that is similar visually to anything else is in- deed visually similar to anything else. To that there can be no objection. The mu- seum's voice-over never explained what, other than the context of their display (a possibility never admitted by the labels or catalogue), could have brought such similarities into being. The third and final section of the show contained the work of contemporary Western artists who are "primitivists." The room's introductory plaque stated that primitivism these days is less inspired by the formal qualities of actual ob- jects, the way they look, as it is by Primitive Man's myth, ritual, and religion- hence the absence of actual Primitive objects in this room. It featured contem- porary sculptures by Euro-American artists with bits of feathers and other items that signify the Primitive. The visitor could infer that the Primitive now is a spirit or attitude rather than the formal qualities of certain objects. Reading chronologically and historically, a visitor strolling through 20th Century Primitivism moved forward in time, from past to present, beginning with Picasso and friends early in the 20th century, passing through a lesson in purely formal relations in the "Affinities" room, and ending with contemporary primitivist artists in 1984. But the same stroll was also a journey through mythi- cal space, one that takes us backwards through time to our origins. It moved from a specific point in historical time, the early 20th century (the exhibit's first part), into the realm of pure form and spirit (the "Affinities" room), and finally</page><page sequence="19">WHAT BECAME AUTHENTIC PRIMITIVE ART? 219 to the mythical realm of the purely authentic (the last room), where the spirit of the Primitive, rather than simply material objects, informs the creation of art. Read as myth rather than history, the sequence narrated the story of the search for modern art's origins, taking us away from mere form and deeper into spirit. If the spirit of classical Greece was the worthy ancestor of Art with a capital A in the Renaissance, the spirit of Primitive Man, this exhibit in effect said, was the worthy ancestor of modern art in the early 20th century. Defining Authentic Primitive Art High Primitive Art is not a set of specific objects but a prototype that de- fines the term Primitive Art. Just as some linguists claim that, when we say the word bird, we have in mind a prototype of a bird (it resembles a robin), in the same way, I believe, when we say Primitive Art our basic prototype is High Primitive Art. Other objects sold or exhibited as Primitive Art gain their legiti- macy or fail in it by their closeness or deviation from High Primitive Art. If the category-prototype "bird" looks more or less like a robin, what does the category-prototype "High Primitive Art" look like? The starting point from which to understand the prototype is the fact that objects of a certain sort gained legitimacy as art as part of high modernism; they migrated into the category art due to their place in the narrative of art history. The highest of High Primitive Art, then, the first-tier or basic core of ob- jects that define the prototype, consists of objects that actually did influence, or look as if they could have influenced, the likes of Picasso and Maurice de Vlaminck: they are African; they were "collected" by the turn of this century; they are in the shape of a mask or the ancestral figure, to wit, an anthropomor- phic form in a certain range of size; they are made of wood; they are ritual ob- jects rather than utilitarian ones (the mask, not the grain-grinder; the ancestral figure, not the basket). Just as the prototype bird may look a lot like a robin but is not actually any particular collection of individual robins, the prototype High Primitive Art looks like the kind of thing that could have influenced Picasso and Vlaminck, but need not actually have done so; it ought to have been collected by the turn of the century, but it may not have been. In other words, the prototype is defined by an idea and a "look" rather than by any particular material exemplars that fit it. The slippage is necessary and inevitable. For one thing, the pieces that ac- tually influenced Picasso or hung in his living room are valuable to collectors because of their provenance, but they may not have been the "finest" examples of their kind; Picasso is reputed to have said, "You don't need a masterpiece to get the idea." Nonetheless, "fine, old" pieces that also look like the things Pi- casso might have been influenced by, but are "better" than the things he looked at or owned, are fully prototypical. Second, whereas many exemplars of the prototype may have been collected after the turn of the century, it is difficult to document these matters, and one can be sure that plenty of objects that have been displayed in the most prestigious</page><page sequence="20">220 CULTURAL ANTHROPOLOGY museums were made later. Fortunately, the analyst seeking to define what High Primitive Art prototypes look like could simply look into the "Affinities" room in the 1984 MoMA show. It contained examples of pieces of Primitive Art bear- ing a supposedly uncanny resemblance to moder art. (Since they were selected because they bore an uncanny resemblance to modern art, the juxtaposition was more canny than not.) The "Affinities" room in effect showed museumgoers how High Primitive Art ought to look. If the prototype of a bird looks like a robin but is not actually a robin, some exemplars of birds that do not deviate greatly from it consist of bluejays and swallows; they are immediately recognizable as birds by people who know the prototype. Second-tier High Primitive Art, the bluejays and swallows of Primi- tive Art, is a deviation from the prototype immediately recognizable even by conservative collectors and curators as exemplars of it. The Rockefeller Wing, in my view, displays this second-tier High Primitive Art. Geographically, the definition has expanded to New Guinea (Asmat, Sepik) and to Mesoamerica (pre-Columbian); the expansion in materials is to pottery and gold in the case of Mesoamerica, and to figures adorned with feathers and raffia in the case of New Guinea and the rest of the Pacific. Another kind of object is now coming onto the market, largely since the 1970s, which is often sold as "authentic ethnic art." I am thinking of the large numbers of beautiful, finely crafted objects and textiles that have been made available to the market in the last couple of decades due to changes in "third world" nation-state policy toward foreign investments and internal minorities, and due to revolutions and the displaced peoples and objects that, in despera- tion, they sell. These sorts of events liberate objects from the contexts that pro- duced them. At galleries and boutiques and from private dealers, one can now see old silks and purses and caps and elaborately worked boxes from parts of China, where individual Euro-American entrepreneur-sellers can now go; ayur- vedic medicine apparatuses and chests from Sri Lanka; textiles, temple decora- tions, and ancestral figures in abundance from Indonesia; or huge quantities of old silver jewelry from Morocco, Ethiopia, and other northerly areas of Africa. Often these objects are not labeled as primitive-it is out of fashion to say the word primitive in any context, and besides, these objects are often from "high," literate, hierarchical societies. The word ethnic, rather, signifies that they are non-Western. And these objects often are not promoted as art-some are utili- tarian, some consist of jewelry, and some are so far from the aesthetics of mod- ernism that they are hardly assimilable as Art with a capital A. Objects of this sort are sometimes labeled crafts, sometimes collectibles, but very often they are called arts, which seems to have a different signification from the singular word art. (The semiotic burden borne by Primitive Art and "ethnic arts" is very different.) Sometimes the signifying feature is that they were "handmade," "used," and "traditional." But they are sold as "authentic," a term that is used by one large emporium of "tribal, ethnic, and folk arts" to mean that they were made and used "pre-1940s." One does not know, of course, when they were made or used, but they may have come onto the market fairly recently. I consider</page><page sequence="21">WHAT BECAME AUTHENTIC PRIMITIVE ART? 221 these sorts of "authentic ethnic arts" to be a kind of third-tier "Authentic Primi- tive Art," perhaps the ducks and chickens-this analogy is getting a little stretched-to the prototype. The kinds of objects that are made for the market by ethnic minorities within North America, or by fourth-world peoples within third-world countries, many of which became independent at midcentury, are currently sold as as con- temporary ethnic arts, authentic Indian jewelry, genuine Mayan folk art, and so forth. They stand to the prototype Authentic Primitive Art perhaps as emus and cassowaries do to the prototype bird. Objects of this sort used to be denigrated as degenerate "tourist art" but now are taking their place as legitimate forms of arts, crafts, and decorations, and are moving into the category of contemporary art, with named artists. (See Figure 4.) It is worth mentioning, finally and briefly, the vast market in kitsch, repro- ductions, and spinoffs of Authentic Primitive Art, although I have run out of birds with which to compare them. These, too, could no doubt be hierarchized; BEAU 1 IFUL INVESTMENTS. The beauty and power of Eskimo art is unmistakable. Now, the investment potential is also-beautiful. The September 14,1981 issue of The MoneyLetter offers these bits of wisdom, written by Rochelle Ryman of Sotheby Parke Bernet, about investing in Inuit Art: .. we're at the beginning of a burgeoning market, even though there has been an unprecedented scul growth in the demand for this kind of art during the last fifteen years. n Representing many great -~~~~~~~~the last ~fifteen years-~" ssculptors of the far North "Prices have increased by an average of 250% (with highs of up to 7,500%), but Inuit art is seriously undervalued when compared to the primitive art of other cultures.

Consider the text in Figure 5a-"Akua'ba is a fertility doll from Ghana. Made of bonded stone."-compared to that in Figure 5b: "FERTILITY DOLL In much of the world, a sculpture like this is a traditional wedding gift given to ensure a boun- tiful future." But it is a close call. All these objects, their markets, their dealers, and their collectors gain le- gitimacy and comprehensibility by the fact that they are anchored by the proto- type Authentic Primitive Art. (As the brochure in Figure 5b puts it, "Primitive art, once fancied only by artists and archaeologists, has recently gained consid- erable appeal. People are realizing that objects like these can look as sophisti- cated as ones in sterling silver.") High Primitive Art stands to the rest of the mar- ket in primitive art more or less as Renaissance painting stands to the rest of the art market. It invented the category. It defines the genre. It anchors the market. Notes 1. Jacques Maquet makes basically the same distinction and acknowledges the same source, but he calls these categories "art by destination" and "art by metamorpho- sis" (1979[1971], 1986). I am renaming the categories out of respect for both Malraux's and Maquet's ideas; the tenor of their writings about "metamorphoses" is entirely different from mine, and it is just as well to keep the terms distinct. 2. The definitive social history of frames has not, to my knowledge, been written, but see Brettell and Starling 1986 for a start. 3. The most useful account of the conceptual reoganization of the arts is probably still Kristeller' s The Modern System of the Arts (1965). 4. The phrase the way something looks means to a rational subject in certain conditions, as Nelson Goodman points out, not the way it looks to a drunk through a teardrop (1976). 5. It is worth noting, in passing, that iconicity is partly in the eye of the beholder. Many societies have produced objects that have some iconic content-that is, signs that signify or refer to other things by resembling them, in local sensibilities. The resem- blance may be highly conventionalized and schematic, recognizable as "resembling" something else only to people in that culture, or it may be secret knowledge, restricted to the initiated. Conventionalized and schematic though they be, the white spots painted on an Australian Aboriginal woman may be "readable" to her and her clan as signifying dappled light on water; the circles painted on Sepik River men's houses may signify "moons" and "women's bellies." These significations have an iconic content, but it would barely be recognized by those not clued in to the semiotic system. (See Morphy 1991 on the Yolngu of Australia, and Forge 1973 on the Abelam of New Guinea.) The problematic of iconicity is a deep topic that has had extensive commentary. See Nelson Goodman 1976. 6.
