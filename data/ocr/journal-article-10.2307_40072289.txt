Sci. 59 (2008), 319-351 Samir Okasha This paper provides a philosophical analysis of the ongoing controversy surrounding R.A. Fisher's famous 'fundamental theorem' of natural selection. The difference be- tween the 'traditional' and 'modern' interpretations of the theorem is explained. I argue that proponents of the modern interpretation have captured Fisher's intended meaning correctly and shown that the theorem is mathematically correct, pace the traditional consensus. However, whether the theorem has any real biological significance remains an unresolved issue. I argue that the answer depends on whether we accept Fisher's non- standard notion of environmental change, on which the theorem rests; arguments for and against this notion are explored. I suggest that there is a close link between Fisher's fundamental theorem and the modern 'gene's eye' view of evolution. 1 Introduction 2 What Does the Fundamental Theorem Say? 3 Key Concepts Explained 4 A lleged Significance of the FTNS 5 Traditional versus Modern Interpretations of the FTNS 6 The Modern Interpretation Illustrated 7 Fisher 's Concept of 'Environmental Change ' 8 Causality and the Modern Interpretation 9 The Significance of the FTNS Re-considered Appendix 1 Introduction The 'fundamental theorem of natural selection' (FTNS), first presented by R.A. Fisher in his famous 1930 book, has long been a controversial topic in evolutionary theory. Fisher believed that his theorem expressed a deep truth about Darwinian evolution; it held, he said, 'the supreme position among the biological sciences' ([1930], p. 47). However, for many years the consensus among experts was that Fisher had greatly overstated the significance of his theorem, and indeed that it was not really a theorem at all, for it only held © The Author (2008).

This view was dominant in evolutionary biology until about the mid-1990s and is still held by many today. However, in recent years the situation has changed somewhat. Drawing on the long-neglected work of Price ([1972]), a number of recent theorists have argued that correctly interpreted, Fisher was actually right - the fundamental theorem is a theorem, that holds true universally, and has at least some of the significance that Fisher claimed for it (cf. Ewens [1989]; Frank and Slatkin [1992]; Edwards [1994]; Frank [1995], [1997]; Lessard [1997]; Grafen [2003]; Rice [2004]). The consensus that Fisher was wrong, these theorists argue, was based on a misinterpretation of his writings. They offer an alternative 'modern interpretation' of what Fisher meant, which makes his theorem come out true.1 In this paper, I offer a philosophical analysis of the ongoing controversy sur- rounding the interpretation and significance of the FTNS. I argue that while the proponents of the modern interpretation have interpreted Fisher correctly and have shown that the FTNS is a correct mathematical statement, pace the tradi- tional consensus, this does not resolve the question of the theorem's biological significance. Whether the FTNS is a biologically significant result depends, I ar- gue, on whether we accept the non-standard notion of 'environmental change' on which Fisher's argument implicitly rests; this in turn depends on our attitude towards the gene's eye view of evolution. The structure of the paper is as follows. Sections 2 and 3 introduce Fisher's theorem and explain the key concepts it contains. Section 4 discusses the alleged significance of the FTNS. Section 5 contrasts the 'traditional' interpretation of the theorem, which underpinned the consensus that Fisher was mistaken, with the 'modern' interpretation favoured by those who think Fisher was right. Section 6 illustrates the modern interpretation with a simple worked example. Section 7 discusses Fisher's notion of environmental change, which underpins his treatment of the FTNS, and connects it with the gene's eye view of evo- lution. Section 8 asks whether the FTNS, under the modern interpretation, can legitimately be glossed in causal terms, as Fisher himself believed. Section 9 revisits the question of the theorem's significance and draws some tentative conclusions. 2 What Does the Fundamental Theorem Say? In The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection, Fisher formulated his fundamen- tal theorem as follows: 'the rate of increase in fitness of any organism at any time is equal to its genetic variance in fitness at that time' ([1930], p. 35). Taken at face value, this statement is most unusual. For the fitness of an organism, as 1 Edwards ([1994]) provides a comprehensive account of the history of the debate over the funda- mental theorem; see also (Grafen [2003]; and Frank [1995]).</page><page sequence="3">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 321 usually understood, is a fixed property of it, not something that changes over time, so what could it mean to talk about its rate of increase? And what could it mean to talk about the variance in fitness of a single organism, rather than an ensemble of organisms? These initial worries evaporate on a closer reading. For in the summary at the end of chapter 2 of The Genetical Theory, Fisher replaced 'organism' with 'species' in his formulation of the FTNS, which makes much better sense. The fitness of a species, understood to mean the average fitness of the organisms it contains (which is how Fisher understood it), obviously can change over time, so it does make sense to talk about its rate of increase. And it also makes sense to talk about a species' variance in fitness, i.e. the variance in fitness of the organisms within the species. What Fisher's theorem seems to say, therefore, is that the average fitness of a species will increase at a rate equal to the species' 'genetic' variance in fitness. (The concept of 'genetic' variance, as opposed to variance /?er se, is explained in section 3.) In a later 1941 paper, Fisher formulated the FTNS somewhat differently, as follows: 'the increase of average fitness of the population ascribable to a change in gene frequency ... is equal to the genetic variance in fitness' ([1941], p. 377). This differs in two respects from the 1930 formulation. 'Species' has been replaced by 'population', and the qualification 'ascribable to a change in gene frequency' has been added. Both changes are welcome. Almost always in biology, the entity whose genetic composition gets altered by natural selection is taken to be a population, not a whole species, though in special cases population and species may coincide. So focusing on the average fitness of a population, rather than a species, brings a gain in generality. As regards the qualification 'ascribable to a change in gene frequency', this turns out to be crucial for understanding the FTNS, as we shall see. Briefly, its importance stems from the fact that average population fitness can be changed by a myriad of different factors, some of which have nothing to do with natural selection. Fisher was only concerned with the change in average fitness that results from the gene frequency changes brought about by selection, as the qualification makes clear. The fundamental theorem, therefore, is about how the average fitness of a population undergoing natural selection will change over time. It says that the rate of change of average fitness, at any time, equals the genetic variance in fitness at that time. Presuming for the moment that this is actually true, why should it matter? Why is it 'fundamental'? This question is discussed fully in section 4, but one preliminary remark can be made at this stage. Since the variance of any variable is by definition non-negative, and since the 'genetic' variance in fitness is part of the total variance in fitness (see section 3), the FTNS seems to imply that the average fitness of a population can only be driven up by natural selection. For if the rate of change of average fitness is always non-negative, then average fitness can never decrease over time. And this</page><page sequence="4">322 Samir Okasha is interesting, for it appears to vindicate the popular view that natural selection is a 'force for the good', constantly improving the well-being of a population. However, the true situation is more complicated than this, as we shall see. 3 Key Concepts Explained The FTNS contains two key biological concepts: the average fitness of the population and a quantity that Fisher calls the 'genetic' variance in fitness. The first of these is straightforward. The fitness of an individual organism (in this context) can be equated with the number of offspring it leaves, or half its gametic contribution to the next generation.2 The average fitness of the population at any time is simply the average of all the organismic fitnesses. Obviously, if the average fitness of the population is greater than unity, the population will grow in size; if the average fitness is less than unity, the population will shrink. Some notation will be useful. We let w, denote the fitness of the rth organism in the population at a given time. We letiv denote the average fitness of the population at that time, soiv = £ Y11 w»&gt; where n is the population size. The instantaneous rate of change of average fitness with respect to time is denoted Clearly, ^jj is only well defined ifvv is a continuous function of time. However, in many formal evolutionary models, w is not continuous in time but rather discrete - it assumes one value in first time period, another in the second, another in the third, and so on. (Discrete-time models are appropriate if the population has non-overlapping generations.) So Fisher's official formulation of the FTNS is only strictly applicable to continuous-time models - which in biological terms means that generations are overlapping. However, a version of the FTNS does apply to discrete-time models, as Ewens ([1989]) shows; in place of the instantaneous rate of change ofvv, the discrete-time version deals with the change invv from one time period to the next, or Aw. If we equate one time period with a generation, thenAiv equals the change invv from one generation to the next. The genetic variance in fitness is a somewhat trickier concept. Importantly, what Fisher called 'genetic variance' is today known as additive genetic variance; from now on, I will use the modern terminology to avoid confusion. Consider firstly the total variance in fitness of the population at a time, or Var(w). This is simply the average squared deviation from mean fitness: 1 n Var(w) = - ^(w,-vv)2. 2 This is what is sometimes called 'realized' fitness, as opposed to 'expected' fitness; the latter is the number of offspring that an organism would on average leave, if it found itself in the same environment repeatedly. The distinction between realized and expected fitness, though important for some purposes, does not matter for the moment.</page><page sequence="5">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 323 Obviously, the value of Var(w) can be influenced by many factors - for the fitness differences among organisms may be due to environmental differences, genetic differences, chance or a combination of these. The total genetic variance in fitness Var(g) - which is not Fisher's 'genetic variance' - is the part of Var(w) attributable to genotypic differences between organisms; it can be calculated using standard least-squares theory, presuming we know the genotype and fitness of every organism in the population. As is well known, Var(g) can itself be partitioned into two components, an additive component and a non-additive (or 'epistatic') component. Schemati- cally, this partition may be written as Total Genetic Variance = Additive Genetic Variance + Non-additive Genetic Variance Var(g) = Varadd(g) + Varnon-adci(g) The additive genetic variance Varadd(g) - which is Fisher's 'genetic variance' - measures the fitness variation in the population that is due to the additive, or independent, action of the genes. To understand this notion, consider the various ways in which an organism's fitness may depend on its genes. One possibility is that every gene has the same effect on the fitness of its host organism, irrespective of which other genes the organism contains, i.e. a gene's effect on fitness is independent of genetic background. If so, then the total genetic variance in the population is equal to the additive genetic variance, i.e. Var(g) = Varadd(g). More likely, the genes will interact with each in determining organismic fitness, i.e. the effect of a given gene on fitness will depend in part on genetic background. If so, there will be a non-additive component to the total genetic variance. The importance of the concept of additive genetic variance stems from sexual reproduction. (In a purely clonal population the distinction between additive and non-additive genetic variance does not apply.) Sexual reproduction means that the genes in the population get re-shuffled every generation, continually appearing in novel combinations. So it is important to know whether this re- shuffling will affect the inheritance of traits that depend on genes, such as fitness. Even if all the fitness differences in a given generation are due to genotypic differences, i.e. Var(w) = Varfe), it does not follow that the differences will be inherited by the offspring; for in the next generation the genes will appear in novel combinations, possibly resulting in a higher or a lower variance in fitness. The point of the concept of additive variance is precisely to distinguish those genetic differences that are heritable from those that are not. It is worth explaining more precisely how the additive genetic variance is computed. Consider the total set of alleles, at all loci, segregating in the pop- ulation. Obviously, each organism will contain 0, 1 or 2 copies of each allele</page><page sequence="6">324 Samir Okasha (presuming the organisms are diploid). So for any organism, we can completely describe its genotype by specifying whether it has 0, 1 or 2 copies of each allele. We can then write an organism's fitness as a linear regression on the number of copies of each allele that it contains, as follows: w( = ^ bj Xij + a j where w, is the fitness of the ith organism, xtj is the number of copies of the y'th allele that the rth organism contains, bj is the partial regression of fitness on the number of copies of theyth allele, and et is the residual to be minimized. (The summation is over all the alleles in the population.) The quantity bj is what Fisher called the average effect of the yth allele on fitness - it measures the contribution that the allele makes, on average, to the fitness of its host organism.3 More precisely, an allele 's average effect tells us how much the fitness of a randomly chosen organism in the population would change, on average, if it received an extra copy of that allele while the rest of its genotype were held fixed. Importantly, an allele's average effect may change across generations, for it will often depend on the population's genetic composition. The quantity^ bj xtj is what the fitness of the ith organism would be if each allele acted independently, i.e. in a perfectly additive way. For simplicity, J^j bj Xij may be abbreviated as AG, (for additive genotype of the ith organism) permitting the regression equation to be written as Wj = AG, + e,. The additive genetic variance in fitness is then simply the variance of AG/, i.e. the fitness variance that would result, if each organism's fitness were exactly as predicted from the linear regression model. So we can write Varadd(g) = Var(AG/) = additive genetic variance in fitness With the foregoing clarifications in mind, let us return to Fisher's fundamen- tal theorem. In our notation, what Fisher seems to have claimed is that ^ = Varadd(g), (1) i.e. the rate of change of average fitness equals the additive genetic variance in fitness. The analogous claim for discrete-time models is Aw = Varadd(g)/vv, (2) i.e. the change in average fitness from one generation to another equals the additive genetic variance in the first generation, divided by mean fitness. Note 3 Fisher's actual definition of 'average effect' was slightly different from the one given here, for instead of regressing an organism's fitness on its allelic composition, Fisher regressed an or- ganism's deviation from average fitness on its allelic composition, i.e. the regression model he used wasw, - w = £; bjXtj + et, rather thanw, = £\ bjXij + et. The slightly different definition adopted here simplifies the exposition and is harmless.</page><page sequence="7">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 325 that (1) and (2) both imply that the average fitness of a population will never decrease over time (and will only be constant if there is zero additive genetic variance, which is empirically most unlikely). Equations (1) and (2) are how the FTNS has usually been interpreted, but as we shall see, they do not quite capture Fisher's intended meaning. 4 Alleged Significance of the FTNS Why did Fisher attach so much importance to the fundamental theorem? This question is not easy to answer, given the somewhat elliptical nature of Fisher's own discussion.4 It seems that he regarded the FTNS as a highly general evolutionary principle, applicable to any population undergoing evolution by natural selection and thus indicative of something deep about the Darwinian process. Indeed, at one point Fisher even compares the FTNS to the second law of thermodynamics (though he was careful to point out the limitations of the analogy). If the FTNS does express a general truth about Darwinian evolution, this is undoubtedly interesting. Many biologists, past and present, have argued for the contingency of the evolutionary process, emphasizing its unpredictable nature and the great diversity of organic forms that it has produced (cf. Gould [1989]). In a similar vein, many philosophers have argued that biology, unlike physics, is essentially a 'historical' science, so does not have laws of its own (cf. Hull [1978]; Rosenberg [1994]). Given the popularity of these ideas, one might wonder whether anything general and non-trivial can be said about Darwinian evolution. If Fisher is right, then the answer is that it can. For the claim that natural selection leads average population fitness to increase at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance is both general and highly non-trivial. The evolutionary process may appear contingent and unpredictable, but the FTNS suggests that it is governed by a simple and powerful underlying principle. Furthermore, the FTNS suggests that evolutionary change, to the extent that it is due to natural selection, is inherently directional. This too is interesting and is what motivates Fisher's analogy with thermodynamics. Just as the second law tells us that closed thermodynamical systems will always go from low entropy states to high entropy states, so the FTNS appears to tell us that an evolving population will always go from states of low average fitness to ones of high average fitness, under the pressure of selection. So evolution by natural selection is not just a process of change but of directed change - it has an 'arrow of time'. Put differently, Darwinian evolution does not satisfy the principle that physicists call 'time-reversal invariance'. 4 See (Price [1972]; Frank and Slatkin [1992]; Grafen [2003]; and in particular Plutynski [2006]) for discussion of the motivation behind Fisher's FTNS.</page><page sequence="8">326 Samir Okasha Michod ([1999]) suggests an additional motivation for the FTNS. He argues that Fisher was trying to establish a point of contact between natural selection and 'everyday' selection; an example of the latter is selecting the most expensive items in the local grocery store. Clearly, if one selects items this way, one expects the average cost of the items in one's basket to exceed the average cost of all the items in the store. Similarly, if the fittest variants in a population get selected at the expense of the less fit, one might expect the average fitness of the population post-selection to exceed its pre-selection value. This analogy is exact if the selection is wholly intra-generational, i.e. if we are considering the change in average fitness within a generation due to differential survival. In the more general cross-generational case, the effects of mating and reproduction complicate the analogy with 'everyday' selection. Michod suggests that the FTNS can be understood as an attempt to extend the analogy to the cross- generational case. Whatever about Fisher's own motivations, many subsequent theorists have accorded considerable significance to the FTNS. One idea that has frequently arisen is that the FTNS provides a mathematical justification for viewing evo- lution as an optimizing process, or for regarding natural selection as a 'force for the good'. It is easy to see where this idea comes from. The average fitness of a population is a natural measure of how well adapted the population is to its environment; the FTNS apparently implies that natural selection can only drive average fitness up, and thus that an evolving population will become bet- ter adapted over time. Biologists have long disagreed on whether Darwinian evolution can legitimately be regarded as 'progressive'; some regard this idea as unexceptionable, others see it as tainted with anthropomorphism.5 If the FTNS could be used to resolve the disagreement mathematically, rather than by appeal to intuition, this would be progress indeed. Another idea that has frequently arisen - though Fisher himself explicitly re- jected it - is that the FTNS supplies a rationale for the popular 'hill-climbing' view of evolution enshrined in the adaptive landscape concept, associated in particular with Sewall Wright. An adaptive landscape depicts the functional relationship between the fitness of a population and its genetic composition; peaks on the landscape correspond to high fitness, troughs to low fitness (Figure 1). Selection is then invoked to explain how an evolving population can move to the top of a peak in the landscape. Lewontin captures this idea nicely when he describes 'the metaphor of evolution as a mountain climber. Mean fitness is like the altitude in a mountain range, and natural selection is like an inner compulsion of a climber to climb yet higher and higher. Hence evolution by natural selection is seen as a maximising or optimizing process 5 See (Ruse [1997]; and Nitecki [1989]) for discussion of this question.</page><page sequence="9">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 327 Figure 1. An adaptive landscape. driving a species to greater and greater fitness' ([2000], p. 321). (Note that Lewontin is describing not endorsing the metaphor in this passage.) Despite its popularity, the adaptive landscape metaphor is actually quite problematic. Critics have questioned whether the landscape is even well defined mathematically, and whether it is possible to read a population's evolutionary trajectory off the landscape's topography, as its proponents assume (cf. Moran [1964]; Edwards [1994]).6 However to many biologists, starting with Wright himself, it seemed that the FTNS provided a formal underpinning for the adaptive landscape concept, by suggesting that the mean population fitness would always increase under the pressure of selection. This supposed link between the FTNS and the adaptive landscape has contributed to the enduring popularity of the latter idea, despite the question mark that hangs over it and despite Fisher's insistence that the link was spurious. (The title of Richard Dawkins' [1996] book Climbing Mount Improbable highlights the extent to which the adaptive landscape concept pervades modern evolutionary thinking.) For all the above reasons, the FTNS has seemed, to both Fisher and others, a result of considerable significance. Assessing its true significance is complicated, 6 An additional problem is that Wright presented two different (incompatible) versions of the adap- tive landscape concept, without distinguishing them. The first depicts the fitness of a population as a function of gene frequencies, as in Figure 1 ; the second depicts the fitness of an organism as a function of the combination of genes within it. See (Edwards [1994]) for discussion of the crucial differences between these two types of adaptive topography.</page><page sequence="10">328 Samir Okasha Figure 2. An evolving population. however, by the controversy over the theorem's interpretation, to which I turn next. 5 Traditional versus Modern Interpretations of the FTNS On the 'traditional' interpretation, the content of the FTNS is captured by Equations (1) and (2) above. So for the continuous time case, the theorem says that the rate of change of average fitness at any time equals the additive genetic variance in fitness at that time; for discrete time, it says that the change in average fitness from one generation to another is proportional to the additive genetic variance in the first generation. This interpretation corresponds well to what Fisher wrote and is how virtually everybody understood the FTNS until quite recently. The traditional interpretation, despite its popularity, leads to a puzzle. For it is simply untrue that the average fitness of a population undergoing natural selection never decreases, so the rate of change of average fitness cannot always be given by the additive genetic variance. To see this, imagine a population containing organisms of two genotypes, A and B, in equal proportion; assume for simplicity the organisms are haploid asexuals. The As are fitter than the Bs, so in the next generation the proportion of As increases (Figure 2). Does it follow that average population fitness has increased too? Not necessarily. For genotypic fitnesses may not be constant across generations. If fitnesses exhibit the negative frequency dependence, it is quite possible that the average fitness will be lower in the second generation - the As are more common, so the fitness of each A is lower, so average fitness is lower too.7 This simple case seems to be a decisive counterexample to the FTNS, under the traditional interpretation. Might Fisher reply that his theorem assumes constancy of genotype fitnesses across generations? (This is a standard assumption in classical population ge- netics, after all.) Given this assumption, is it true that natural selection can never drive average fitness down? In a population of haploid asexuals, the answer is 7 This example illustrates how the analogy between natural selection and 'everyday' selection may fail once reproduction is taken into account.</page><page sequence="11">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 329 yes. In the example above, if the fitnesses of the As and Bs remain constant be- tween generations, then average population fitness must be higher in the second generation, obviously. But in a sexual population, where genotypes are broken up and re-created every generation, selection can drive average fitness down even with constancy of genotype fitnesses, as Moran ([1964]) first showed.8 (This counter-intuitive result arises because of a combination of linkage and epista- sis in a multi-locus system.) So again, the FTNS as traditionally interpreted seems straightforwardly false - since average population fitness can decrease over time, its rate of change cannot be equal to the additive genetic variance, since the latter quantity is necessarily non-negative. How did biologists explain the fact that the FTNS comes out false, on the traditional interpretation? Three different explanations were put forward, in the years following the theorem's publication (cf. Edwards [1994]). The first was simply that the FTNS is false, i.e. Fisher had made a mistake. The second was that the FTNS, though not universally true, does hold true under certain conditions, which Fisher was implicitly assuming to be satisfied; proponents of this explanation devoted considerable effort to trying to identify these condi- tions. The third was that the FTNS was not intended as exact result but as an approximation; proponents of this explanation devoted considerable effort to seeking an error bound for the approximation. None of these three explanations was wholly satisfactory. It was hard to believe that Fisher had made a mistake, especially over something so important to him. (Moreover, as Edwards [1994] notes, in a 1941 paper Fisher himself gave an example of how natural selection can fail to alter average population fitness, despite extensive additive genetic variance.) Secondly, Fisher repeatedly stressed that the FTNS did hold universally (and would hardly have called it a 'theorem' otherwise, nor compared it to the second law of thermodynamics.) And finally, he was explicit that the FTNS was an exact result, not an approximation, speaking of the "rigour of the demonstration" of the theorem ([1930], p. 35). So the traditional interpretation of the FTNS leads to a puzzle. The theorem faces obvious counterexamples, of which Fisher was clearly aware, and no plausible explanation exists for why he nonetheless thought that it expressed a fundamental truth about Darwinian evolution. It is here that the 'modern interpretation' comes in. In a landmark paper that went unnoticed for many years, Price ([1972]) offered a compelling solution to the puzzle. Based on careful mathematical analysis of his own, and detailed exegesis of Fisher's writings, Price showed that the traditional interpretation was almost certainly wrong. Fisher was not talking about the rate of change of average fitness at all, but rather the partial rate of change which results 8 See (Edwards [ 1 994]; and Ewens [ 1 989]) for discussion of Moran's and similar results concerning the change in mean fitness.</page><page sequence="12">330 Samir Okasha from natural selection altering gene frequencies in the population, in a constant environment. It is this partial rate of change that the FTNS says is equal to the additive genetic variance, according to Price. So the fact that we can construct examples in which average fitness decreases does not show that Fisher was wrong; such examples show only that the total rate of change of average fitness cannot equal the additive genetic variance, which does not contradict the FTNS when understood as Price suggests. The key to the modern interpretation is the qualification 'due to natural selection in a constant environment' that attaches to Fisher's talk of the change in average fitness. As Price notes, Fisher often either omitted the qualification altogether, or failed to explain what he meant by it, leading to the misconception that his theorem was about the total rate of change, rather than the partial rate of change.9 Without the qualification the FTNS is simply untrue - for it implies that selection must always drive the average population fitness up, which as we have seen is false. With the qualification, understood in a very specific way, the theorem does come out true, as Price shows. This strongly suggests that the partial change reading is the correct interpretation of Fisher, a view endorsed by many recent commentators. Schematically, the difference between the traditional and modern interpreta- tions of the FTNS can be expressed as follows. On the traditional interpretation, the FTNS is about the total rate of change of average fitness^, or the total changeAw for discrete-time models. On the modern interpretation, the FTNS is about the partial rate of change ~ where all environmental factors are held constant, orAwNS in the discrete-time case. (The subscript NS indicates that this is the part of the total change 'due to' natural selection.) The FTNS there- fore asserts thatf^ = Varadd(g), or in discrete time thatAivNS= Varadd(s)/H&gt;. These assertions imply nothing about the total change; they concern only the part of the change that is due to natural selection acting in a constant environment. Comparison of the Traditional and Modern Interpretations of the FTNS Traditional Interpertation Modern Interpretation Continuous Time Continuous Time-- = Varadd(g) - = Varadd(g) dt dt Discrete Time Aw = Varadd(g)/H&gt; AvvNS = Varadd(g)/vv What exactly does Fisher mean by the change in average fitness 'due to natural selection in a constant environment'? This turns out to be the pivotal issue, 9 Price remarks: 'Fisher's explanations of his theorem are afflicted by a truly astonishing number of obscurities, infelicities of expression, typographical errors, omissions of crucial explanations, and contradictions between difference passages about the same point' ([1972], p. 140).</page><page sequence="13">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 331 discussed at length in sections 6 and 7. Briefly, Fisher's reasoning was as fol- lows. Natural selection is not the only factor that can cause the average fitness of a population to change, obviously. Another important factor is environ- mental change, which Fisher thought would usually reduce average fitness - as might happen, for example, if deforestation destroys a bird population's habi- tat. (However, Fisher understood 'environmental change' in an extremely broad way, as we shall see.) Given the possibility of environmental change, it seems unlikely that anything general can be said about either the magnitude or direc- tion of the total change in average fitness, in real biological populations. But if we hold fixed the environment and consider only the partial change that results from natural selection, something general can be said, Fisher believed, namely, that this partial change is given by the additive genetic variance. Fisher's underlying idea - that to isolate the change due to natural selection we need to hold fixed the environment - is in itself perfectly reasonable. If deforestation destroys a bird population's habitat, driving average fitness down, it might still be true that natural selection would have increased average fitness had the environmental deterioration not occurred; to assess this, we need to consider the effect of selection in a constant environment. More controversial, however, is how Fisher understood environmental constancy (and thus change). For Fisher, constancy of environment from one generation to another meant constancy of the average effects of all the alleles in the population. Recall that an allele's average effect (on fitness) is the partial regression of organismic fitness on the number of copies of that allele. Fisher's idea was that to isolate the change due to natural selection itself, we need to hold fixed these partial regression coefficients from one generation to another. Any change in the average effects constitutes an environmental change, so must be discounted if we wish to identify the change due to selection. The precise mathematical content of the FTNS, under the modern interpre- tation, can now be stated. If the average effects of all alleles are held constant, and if natural selection is the only force affecting allele frequencies in the pop- ulation (i.e. mutation, migration and drift are absent), then the average fitness will increase at a rate equal to the additive genetic variance. This statement is true, as Price ([1972]) and others have shown, thus vindicating Fisher. In general, the average effects will not be constant across generations - for a va- riety of reasons, including the fact that they themselves often depend on allele frequencies. This is why the FTNS deals only with the partial change in average fitness, not the total change. Recall the apparent counterexamples to the FTNS discussed above - in which average fitness declines over time. It should now be clear why these are not counterexamples, given the modern interpretation of the FTNS. For Fisher will detect a component of environmental change in these examples, that counteracts the tendency of natural selection to increase average fitness. In the</page><page sequence="14">332 Samir Okasha example where genotype fitnesses exhibit the negative frequency dependence, Fisher will say that 'environmental deterioration' has occurred - for the geno- typic composition of the population is itself part of the environment of each organism, on his view. So although average fitness declines in this example, this is because a force in addition to natural selection has operated, namely envi- ronmental deterioration. Had the environment (in Fisher's sense) remained the same, average fitness would have increased. In my view, Price and others have shown convincingly that the 'partial change' formulation is what Fisher had in mind, and that the FTNS is thus a correct mathematical statement. However, a number of key questions remain. Firstly, is Fisher right to describe the partial change that results from holding fixed the average effects as the change 'due to' natural selection? Secondly, is he right to argue that any change in average effects from one generation to another constitutes an 'environmental' change? Thirdly, what biological signif- icance does the FTNS, under the modern interpretation, actually have? It is important to see that these questions are not resolved by abandoning the traditional interpretation in favour of the modern. Given the modern interpre- tation, the FTNS states a mathematical truth about populations that evolve by natural selection, stated above. But this does not in itself answer the three ques- tions above. Indeed, proponents of the modern interpretation, including Price ([1972]), Ewens ([1989]), Frank ([1997]) and Grafen ([2003]), disagree among themselves about each of these questions. So while the modern interpretation marks a major advance, it does not resolve all aspects of the controversy over the FTNS. Before turning to the outstanding issues, it is worth illustrating more precisely how the modern interpretation works, in relation to a simple example. 6 The Modern Interpretation Illustrated Consider a standard one-locus population genetics model with non- overlapping generations. Two alleles, A and B, segregate at the locus, giving rise to three diploid genotypes, AA, AB and BB, whose relative frequencies in the first generation are/AA,/AB and/BB, respectively; obviously, /aa +/ab + /bb = 1. All organisms with the same genotype are assumed to have the same fitness; the fitness differences between genotypes are assumed to stem from differences in viability, not fecundity/fertility.10 Genotype fitnesses in the first generation are wAA, h&gt;ab and wBB, respectively, so the average fitness of the population isvv =/AA wAA +/AB n&gt;AB +/BB wbb. 10 The point of restricting attention to viability selection is to ensure that the first-generation gene frequencies after selection equal the second-generation gene frequencies; this means that the gene frequency dynamics do not depend on the mating pattern in the population, which does not need to be specified. (So it is not necessary to assume that genotype frequencies are in Hardy- Weinberg proportions.) See (Ewens [1989]) for further discussion.</page><page sequence="15">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 333 Figure 3. Evolution of a diploid population. Natural selection operates between generations one and two, modifying the genetic composition of the population (Figure 3); we assume there is no mutation, migration or random drift. In the second generation, genotype frequencies are /'aa, /'ab, /'bb, and genotype fitnesses are v^aa, w*ar and h^bb, respectively. So we are not assuming that genotype fitnesses remain con- stant across generations, though they may do. Obviously, average fitness in the second generation isvv' = /Xa^aa + /ab^ab + /bb^bb* The total change in av- erage fitness from the first to the second generation isAvv; by definition, A w = W -w. As we have seen, the FTNS, on the modern interpretation, is not about the total changeAvv but the partial changeAvvNS, calculated by holding fixed the average effects of the alleles. It is worth seeing exactly howAivNs is computed. Firstly we calculate the average effects, by writing an organism's fitness as a linear regression on the number of alleles of each type that it contains: Wij = at + ay + dj, ij = A, B where aA and aB are the average effects of the A and B alleles, respectively, and etj is the error to be minimized. So aA measures the change in organismic fitness that an additional copy of the A allele brings, against a fixed genetic background; similarly for «b • Therefore, if we randomly pick an A allele from an organism in the population and replace it with a B, the effect on the organism's fitness, on average, will be [o?b - a a]. (This quantity is known as the 'average effect of a gene substitution'.) A good way to understand the regression model is to think of it as a 'scheme' for trying to predict the fitness of any organism on the basis of information about its genotype. We want the scheme to be such that the predicted fitness of an organism is as close as possible to its actual fitness, i.e. the error in prediction should be minimized. So we choose values of «a and «b which minimize this error, by the least-squares criterion. The actual and predicted fitness of an organism of each genotype are then:</page><page sequence="16">334 Samir Okasha Genotype Actual Fitness 'Predicted' Fitness AA h&gt;aa &lt;*a + &lt;*a = 2a A AB h&gt;ab a a + &lt;*b BB H&gt;BB OtB + «b = 2«b Clearly, if the predictive scheme is perfect, there will be no error at all, i.e. the actual and predicted fitnesses will coincide exactly. But this may not be possible, for an organism's actual fitness may not depend linearly on its genetic composition. Only if the A and B alleles make additive contributions to fitness, i.e. only if [m&gt;aa - h&gt;ab] = [h'ab - h&gt;bb] will the predictive scheme be perfect. Otherwise, actual fitness and predicted fitness will necessarily deviate for at least one of the genotypes. We are now in a position to see how Fisher calculates the partial change in average fitnessAvvNs- We begin with the standard expression forvv in the first generation: w = /aa h&gt;aa + /ab wab + /bb h&gt;bb- In place of the actual genotype fitnesses h&gt;aa&gt; wab anc* ^bb* we now substitute the predicted fitnesses 2«a, &lt;*a + «b, an(* 2«b- As noted, these may differ from the actual fitnesses, but the substitution is legitimate in this case becausevv is on the LHS. (That this substitution preserves equality is a logical consequence of the least-squares procedure for calculating a a and ojb) So we have w = /aa 2aA + /ab(«a + &lt;*b) + /bb 2aB, (3) which expressesvv in terms of the average effects. We now plug in the second- generation genotype frequencies, keeping the average effects the same, to get /Xa 2aA + /AB(aA + orB) + /bb 2&lt;*b- (4) Expression (4) tells us what average fitness would be in the second generation, if the average effects of both alleles remain the same. Since they need not remain the same, this is not the actual average fitness in the second generation. Note that expression (4) uses the second generation genotype frequencies, but the first generation average effects. The partial changeAvvNS is then simply the difference between (4) and (3), i.e. Ah'ns = [/aa 2&lt;*a + /AB(aA + «b) + /bb 2aB] - [/aa 2orA + /ab(&lt;*a + &lt;*B) + /bb 2aB]- In words,Avi&gt;NS is the difference between average fitness in the first generation and what average fitness in the second generation would be, if the alleles' average effects remained the same. Therefore, A vvNS is not the total change in average</page><page sequence="17">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 335 fitness Aw; these two quantities will only be equal if the average effects are in fact constant across generations, which they generally are not, as discussed below. The proof of the FTNS now follows directly, for this simple one-locus exam- ple. From the above expression for AvvNs, it is straightforward to show that AwNs is equal to the additive genetic variance divided by w, just as the FTNS under the modern interpretation asserts. (See the Appendix for the proof.) The extension to multiple alleles at a locus, to multiple loci, and to continuous-time models, is straightforward and introduces nothing conceptually new; see (Ewens [1989]) for details. Ewens ([1989]) makes the important point that the partial changeAvvNs, though initially calculated from changes in genotype frequencies, actually de- pends only on changes in gene (or allele) frequencies (see Equation (A.7)) (Recall that gene frequencies are uniquely determined by genotype frequencies but not vice versa.) This point permits another perspective on Fisher's argu- ment, for it means that AvvNs does not depend on how the genes get 'packaged' into diploid genotypes. So we can adopt a 'gene's eye view', and treat our pop- ulation as a population of genes, rather than organisms. The genes are of two types, A and B; mean population fitness depends on the relative frequencies of A and B, and on their average effects. Selection then operates, leading to new gene frequencies in the second generation. Fisher uses the new gene frequencies to calculate what mean fitness in the second generation would be, if the average effects remained the same; from this he calculates the partial change in mean fitnessAvvNs and shows that it is proportional to the additive genetic variance. As we shall see, the fact that Fisher's argument can be formulated in genie rather than genotypic terms turns out to be quite significant. 7 Fisher's Concept of 'Environmental Change' The above illustration of how the partial changeAvvNS is computed high- lights the logical structure of Fisher's argument clearly. As we have seen, Fisher was not interested in the total changeAvv, but rather the partial changeAivNs - which he attributed to natural selection acting in a constant environment. The difference betweenAvv andAwNs arises because the average effects in the second generation may differ from those in the first, in which case the environment has changed, according to Fisher. So to understand Fisher's notion of environmental change, we need to ask what factors can lead the average effects to change between generations. These factors are of two broad types. Firstly, the genotype fitnesses h&gt;aa, h&gt;ab and h&gt;bb rnay themselves change across generations, either because of the frequency dependence, or because of changes to the external environment. (That the fitness of a genotype depends on the environment is a familiar point.)</page><page sequence="18">336 Samir Okasha Figure 4. Non-additivity of genotype fitness. If genotype fitnesses change from one generation to another, for whatever reason, it is clear that the average effects a\ and «b will change too; for recall that they are the values that best predict the fitness of a genotype in accordance with the linear prediction scheme. Secondly, even if genotype fitnesses are constant across generations, the average effects may still change, because they typically depend on the genetic composition of the population, which itself changes. This last point is important and deserves explanation. If genotype fitnesses are constant, why should the values of a a and c*b depend on the population's genetic composition? The answer lies in the fact that the alleles' effects on fitness may be non-additive. If perfect additivity obtains, i.e. if [h&gt;aa - wab] = [wab - wbb]&gt; then a a and «b will be independent of genotype frequency - for then, aA = ^aa and «b = j^bb- But if there is any dominance (or in the multi-locus case, any epistasis between loci), then the average effects will depend on genotype frequency. A simple way to see this is to recall the quantity [q?b - a aL which is the change in organismic fitness that would result, on average, if a randomly chosen A allele were substituted for a B. If there is an element of dominance, as in Figure 4, then the effect of an A-»B substitution on fitness will depend on whether the A allele in question is in an AA or an AB genotype. So if genotype frequencies change, the average effect of the substitution will change too - for the probability that the chosen A allele is in an AA genotype (for example), will have changed. This explains why the average effects may depend on the population's genetic composition, i.e. on genotype frequencies, even with constant genotypic fitnesses. To summarize, two types of factors can lead the average effects to change and thus to an environmental change in Fisher's sense. Firstly, genotype fit- nesses may themselves change across generations, either because of changes to the external environment or because of the frequency dependence of genotypic fitness. Secondly, even if genotype fitnesses are constant across generations, the average effects may $//// change, because in the presence of dominance or epis- tasis, the average effects will depend on the population's genetic composition.</page><page sequence="19">Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 337 In general, the average effects will only be constant across generations if (i) genotype fitnesses are themselves constant and (ii) there is no dominance or epistasis, i.e. perfect additivity obtains. Under these (very rare) conditions, the total change in average fitnessAw will equal the partial changeAvvNs, but not otherwise. Fisher's notion of 'environmental change' is central to his understanding of the FTNS, but is it legitimate? The idea that a population's genotypic compo- sition is part of the selective environment of each organism in the population is quite standard, so Fisher's viewpoint may appear innocuous.11 However, mat- ters are not quite so simple. For this understanding of 'selective environment' applies most naturally when organisms engage in fitness-affecting interactions with each other - which generally leads to the frequency dependence of geno- typic fitness. But Fisher invokes this extended concept of 'selective environment' even when there are no interactions among the organisms, which is somewhat odd. Suppose the members of a given population engage in no fitness-affecting inter- actions at all - an organism's fitness depends only on its own genotype, not on the composition of its population. If the population's genotypic composition changes, intuitively this does not count as a change to the selective environment, for it has no effect on genotypic fitnesses. But Fisher will say there has been an environmental change (unless dominance and epistasis are wholly absent), on the grounds that the selective environment of the genes has changed, manifest in their new average effects. This consideration must cast some doubt on Fisher's lumping together non- additive effects (i.e. dominance and epistasis) with changes in genotype fitness, as possible sources of environmental change. Where genotype fitnesses change across generations, whether because of the frequency dependence or because of changes to the external environment, it is perfectly plausible to argue that the selective environment has changed. However, where genotype fitnesses are constant across generations but the average effects change because of domi- nance and/or epistasis, it is rather less plausible to say that there has been an environmental change.12 But Fisher is committed to saying this; indeed, it is essential to his interpretation of the FTNS. For unless we accept the thesis that any change in the average effects constitutes an environmental change, there is no justification for regarding A vvns as the change due to natural selection 'in a fixed environment', nor for attaching any significance at all to the fact thatAvvNS is always non-negative. 1 x This notion of selective environment is implicit in much work on the evolution of social behaviour; see (Brandon [1990]) for an explicit defence of the notion. 12 Interestingly, Price, in the paper that launched the 'modern interpretation' of the FTNS, com- mented on Fisher's 'device of treating non-additive gene effects as "environment",' a device that Price regarded as a 'defect' of the theorem ([1972], p. 139); see also the discussion in (Ewens [1989]). The 'defect' is not something that could be eliminated; it is essential to the theorem.</page><page sequence="20">338 Samir Okasha The above criticism of Fisher can be formulated somewhat differently, as follows. Suppose that in calculating the partial change A h&gt;ns&gt; Fisher had held fixed the actual genotype fitnesses h&gt;aa&gt; w&gt;ab and wbb, rather than the predicted genotype fitnesses 2a^ a a + «b, 2c*b. This would be a perfectly reasonable way of trying to isolate the change due to natural selection, for it is uncontroversial that if genotypic fitnesses are different in generation 2 than in generation 1, the selective environment must have changed. However, Fisher's strategy of holding fixed the predicted genotype fitnesses, i.e. the average effects, is more dubious, for there exist situations where the 'selective environment', as ordinarily under- stood, remains the same, but where the average effects nonetheless change. And of course, holding fixed the average effects is essential to Fisher's derivation, for if one instead holds fixed the actual genotype fitnesses, the resulting partial change invv need not be non-negative.13 Given that Fisher's argument rests essentially on a non-standard notion of environment, what should we make of it? I think there are two possible reac- tions. One is simply that the notion of environment in question is illegitimate, i.e. there is no theoretical justification for equating environmental constancy with constancy of the average effects. In effect, this is to say that the FTNS, though mathematically correct, is devoid of any biological significance - an opinion held by a number of commentators. However, an alternative, more positive reaction is to regard Fisher's notion of environment as a reflection of his commitment to 'gene's eye' thinking. As we saw in section 6, the FTNS can be understood 'genically' by thinking of the population as a population of genes, rather than diploid organisms. This leads naturally to the idea of a 'genie environment' (cf. Price [1972], p. 130). An important part of a gene's environ- ment, clearly, is the other genes present in the same organism (at the same and at different loci). In the presence of dominance and/or epistasis, the 'fitness' of a given type of gene, measured by its average effect, will depend on which other genes it tends to find itself with. Therefore, changes to the average effects that arise from changes in the population's genetic composition can indeed be regarded as environmental. I suggest, therefore, that Fisher's notion of environment, and in particular his equating environmental constancy with constancy of average effects, should be understood as an early statement of the gene's eye view of evolution - the view, made famous years later by Hamilton, Williams and Dawkins, that in- dividual genes are the true units of selection.14 The gene's eye view provides a theoretical justification for lumping together as 'environmental' both non- additive gene effects, i.e. dominance and epistasis, with changes in genotype 13 This is an obvious corollary of Moran's ([1964]) proof, discussed in section 5, that with constant genotype fitnesses selection can nonetheless drive average fitness down. 14 The idea that there may be some connection between the FTNS and gene's eye thinking (or 'genie selectionism') was first broached by Sarkar ([1994]), but not developed in detail.</page><page sequence="21">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 339 fitness; this lumping is essential to Fisher's argument, as we have seen. Once we think in terms of a population of genes, rather than diploid organisms, it no longer looks so odd to argue that the selective environment changes when gene frequencies change, even in the absence of any fitness-affecting interactions between organisms. For what matter are the interactions between the genes, not the organisms. Interestingly, the notion of 'genie environment' that Fisher implicitly in- vokes, in deriving his FTNS, has been explicitly defended by Sterelny and Kitcher ([1988]) in a different context. Sterelny and Kitcher were responding to Sober and Lewontin's ([1982]) argument that heterozygote advantage (over- dominance) creates a problem for the gene's eye view of evolution because it means that an individual gene does not have a 'uniform causal role' - the same gene raises the fitness of its host organism in some contexts but lowers it in others, so cannot itself be the locus of selection. Sterelny and Kitcher replied that heterozygote advantage can be understood from the gene's eye view, so long as we understand the notion of environment suitably. From an individual gene's point of view, the other genes in its host organism (at the same and other loci) constitute part of its environment, and it is a familiar point that the fitness of any biological unit is environment-relative. So heterozygote advantage does not constitute a problem for the gene's eye view, Sterelny and Kitcher argued; it simply reminds us that we need to relativize fitness to the environment - genie environment in this case. This parallel between Fisher's and Sterelny and Kitcher's arguments is quite instructive, not just because both appeal to the notion of 'genie environment', but also because both are led to do so by the existence of non-additive interac- tions between genes (i.e. dominance and epistasis). The parallelism lends sup- port to my claim that in adopting his unusual notion of environmental change, Fisher is implicitly invoking the gene's eye viewpoint.15 Indeed, Fisher's thesis that any change in the average effects constitutes an environmental change de- served to be regarded as one of the earliest, and strikingly clearest, explications of what adopting the gene's eye view really amounts to. Of course, the gene's eye view of evolution is not uncontroversial; the debate over its merits and 15 However there is one technical difference between Fisher's and Sterelny and Kitcher's arguments. Fisher's point is that in the presence of dominance/epistasis, the average effects of the genes will depend on gene frequencies, so will change as the population evolves. Sterelny and Kitcher claim, however, that in the presence of heterozygote advantage, the marginal fitnesses of the genes will depend on gene frequencies. The problem with this claim is that the marginal fitnesses are always dependent on gene frequencies, even in the absence of heterozygote advantage, i.e. even with perfect additivity - except in the limiting case where all genotypes have the same fitness. (That this is so can be seen by inspecting the expressions for marginal fitness in the Appendix.) Therefore, Sterelny and Kitcher's argument is wrongly formulated; they should be talking about average effects, not marginal fitnesses. Nonetheless, the points that Sterelny and Kitcher make about the 'genie environment' are sound and well taken. See (Okasha [2006], Chapter 5) for further discussion.</page><page sequence="22">340 Samir Okasha de-merits continues today. So showing that Fisher's argument relies on the gene's eye view does not show that his argument is correct, but it does show that some theoretical justification exists for the conception of environment implicit in the FTNS. 8 Causality and the Modern Interpretation I turn now to a different, though related, issue. On the modern interpretation, the FTNS concerns the partial change in average fitnessAvvNs- Since the partial change is only rarely equal to the total change, this raises the question of why we should care about the partial change. Is the fact thatAvvNS must always be non- negative, as the FTNS tells us, of any biological interest? Fisher's own answer is thatAvvNs represents the change in average fitness 'due to', or 'caused by', natural selection, and so is a biologically significant quantity (cf. Fisher [1941]). This answer is endorsed by some proponents of the modern interpretation, e.g. Frank and Slatkin ([1992]), but explicitly rejected by others, e.g. Ewens ([1989]). Still others, including Price ([1972]), appear undecided about the legitimacy of glossing the partial change in causal terms. I think we should agree that //it is correct to regard AvvNs as the part of the total change 'caused by' natural selection, then it is undoubtedly a quantity of interest; and the fact thatAvvNs is always non-negative is then interesting too, for it means that when natural selection is the only causal force in operation, average fitness can never decrease. But is this causal construal of AvvNs correct? That is the crucial question. In a well-known discussion, Ewens ([1989]) rejected Fisher's causal construal of Avvns» for a simple reason. Recall that Avvns is calculated by holding fixed the average effects of the alleles across the generations. As we have seen, the average effects may in fact change, but Fisher regarded this as environmental change. Ewens argues, by contrast, that in many cases natural selection is what leads the average effects to change, so Fisher's assertion thatAvvNs is the component of the total change 'due to' natural selection is mistaken. The basis for Ewens' argument is clear. The average effects generally depend on the population's genetic composition, as explained in section 7, which in turn is affected by natural selection. So Fisher's claim thatAvvNS represents the change 'due to' selection is incorrect, forAvvNs is calculated by holding fixed the average effects, and selection itself leads the average effects to change, by altering the population's genetic composition. Importantly, Ewens is not disputing the mathematical correctness of the FTNS; rather, he is arguing that the partial changeAvvNS does not have the sig- nificance that Fisher claims for it. Intuitively, to isolate the change mw 'caused by' selection, we need to consider what the change invv would be, if selection were the only evolutionary force operating. Fisher claims that we can do this by</page><page sequence="23">Fisher's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 341 holding fixed the average effects and comparingvv before and after selection has operated. But Ewens points out that the average effects are themselves affected by selection, given that they depend on the genetic composition of the popu- lation, which selection alters. SoAivNS cannot legitimately be equated with the change due to selection. To focus this issue, it helps to consider a more abstract scenario. Consider any evolving system (not necessarily biological) which is being impinged on by a number of forces, or causal factors, leading the value of a particular variable Q to change from one time period to another. Suppose that A Q can be written as the sum of two components: AQ = x + y. Now suppose someone claims that the quantity x represents the part of A Q that is 'due to' or 'caused by' factor F. Intuitively, for this claim to be true, the following counterfactual must also be true: 'if factor F had not operated, then AQ would have been equal to y\ For if this counterfactual statement is false, then the difference made by factor F to the total change AQ must be more than or less than x, not equal to it.16 Though the precise link between causality and counterfactuals is a complex issue, the falsity of this counterfactual would surely be a sufficient reason for disputing the claim that x is the part of A Q due to factor F. In the case at hand, the total change in mean fitnessAvv plays the role of AQ, the partial change AivNS plays the role of x, and natural selection plays the role of F. (The role of y is played, trivially, by[Avv - AivNS].) Though he does not put it this way, Ewens' objection to Fisher is that the counterfactual statement in question will often be untrue, and thus it will be untrue that AvvNS equals the change caused by natural selection. Given that selection alters gene frequencies, on which the average effects depend, the counterfactual statement 'if natural selection had not operated, the total change would have been[Avv - AivNs]' will often be false of an evolving population, and thus it will be false thatAvvNS equals the part of Avv due to selection. Put differently, to find the change 'due to selection', we need to compare the actual changeAvv with the change that would have resulted if selection had not operated, and subtract the latter from the former; but when we do this, we do not getAvvNs- So the fact thatAvvNs is always non-negative, as the FTNS shows, is of dubious biological significance. How powerful an objection is this? Apart from the link between causality and counterfactuals, Ewens' objection rests only on the indisputable fact that 16 This does not mean that whenever multiple causal factors are affecting a given system, the overall change can be decomposed in an additive way. Whether an additive decomposition is possible is an empirical question. My claim is only that if an additive decomposition is possible, and if the claim is then made that one of the components is the change 'due to' factor F, the counterfactual must be true.</page><page sequence="24">342 Samir Okasha Figure 5. Two causal pathways by which selection affectsw. the average effects depend on gene frequencies, which selection alters. So his objection may seem very powerful. However, there is in fact a possible response which the defender of Fisher can make, by invoking a distinction between the 'direct' and 'indirect' effects of natural selection. The response is suggested by some remarks of Fisher ([1941]) and ties in with the interpretation of the FTNS offered by Frank and Slatkin ([1992]) - who explicitly endorse the causal reading of A vvns- The direct/indirect distinction goes as follows. When a population is subject to natural selection, the direct effect is always a change in gene frequencies, according to Fisher. (This was a point he often emphasized.) However, there may also be downstream or indirect effects, themselves consequent on the change in gene frequencies. (For example, if selection leads to the spread of genes that cause organisms to forage more efficiently, this may lead the popu- lation to overexploit its food resources and ultimately go extinct.) In itself, this point is uncontroversial. Taken in conjunction with Fisher's idea, discussed in section 7, that the genetic composition of the population itself constitutes part of the environment, it implies that one indirect effect of natural selection will be to change the environment.17 And when the environment changes, this may it- self cause other changes; specifically, it may alter the mean population fitnessvv. Therefore, there are actually two causal pathways by which natural selection can altervv: directly by changing gene frequencies in a fixed environment and indirectly by changing the environment itself. This idea is depicted graphically in Figure 5. It should be clear how the direct/indirect distinction helps salvage Fisher's argument from Ewens' objection. When Fisher says thatAvvNs is the change due to selection, he means the change due to the direct action of natural selection, i.e. transmitted by the direct pathway only - the horizontal arrow in Figure 5. To isolate this change, we need to hold fixed (i.e. conditionalize on) the state of the environment, which in Fisher's terms means holding fixed the average effects. So while Ewens' point - that the average effects depend on 17 That natural selection can lead to changes in the selective environment, of both the population undergoing selection and other populations (not necessarily conspecific), is a central theme in the literature on 'niche construction'; see (Odling-Smee et al. [2003]).</page><page sequence="25">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 343 gene frequencies, which natural selection alters - is correct, this does not refute Fisher. For Fisher is not concerned with the overall (direct plus indirect) effect of natural selection onvv, but only the direct effect. The change inn&gt; that occurs via the indirect pathway in Figure 5, though 'ultimately' attributable to natural selection, is not part of its direct effect, which is what the FTNS deals with. It follows that the 'two causal pathways' idea gives Fisher a way of responding to the argument based on counterfactuals, sketched above. When we ask: 'what would average fitness have been if natural selection had not operated?', and the answer turns out to be not equal to[Aiv - Ah&gt;ns], Fisher can say that this is still compatible withAvvNS being the change due to direct selection. For the envisaged counterfactual scenario, in which natural selection does not operate, is one in which no causal influence is transmitted along either pathway, whereas what we need to consider, to determine the direct effect of selection, is the counterfactual scenario in which only the direct pathway is blocked. So the relevant question is 'what would average fitness have been if natural selection had not operated but the environmental change had still occurred', to which[Aiv - Avvns] is the correct answer, as the FTNS shows. The fact that the environmental change was itself partly due to selection is beside the point. How convincing is this Fisherian response? The general point that one variable may transmit causal influence to another via multiple pathways is uncontroversial.18 For example, adding fertilizer to a field of corn plants may increase the crop yield via two pathways: (i) by improving the nutrient quality of the soil and (ii) by being poisonous to the rabbits that eat the plants. It is also uncontroversial that to measure the strength of the causal influence along just one pathway, we need to hold fixed the influence being transmitted along the second pathway, either experimentally or statistically (i.e. by conditional- ization.) So there is nothing in principle wrong with Fisher's idea that natural selection can affect the value ofw via two routes, nor with his technique for measuring the strength of causal influence transmitted along the direct route. Once this general point about multiple causal pathways is conceded to Fisher, his response to Ewens rests on two further ideas: that natural selection may itself affect the selective environment and that the state of environment may affectiv. Neither of these ideas is particularly controversial. The first is a commonplace in the literature on 'niche construction' (cf. Odling-Smee et al. [2003]); the second is a corollary of the familiar fact that genotype fitness is always environment- relative. So Fisher's response to Ewens' objection - thatAvvNs is the change directly attributable to natural selection - seems founded on irreproachable logic. 18 This idea is a commonplace in the literature on causal graphs and Bayes networks; see for example (Pearl [2000]).</page><page sequence="26">344 Samir Okasha Nonetheless, it is natural to feel a lingering disquiet with Fisher's response, because it rests on his somewhat unusual notion of selective environment, discussed previously. Someone might concede to Fisher that natural selection can affect the environment, that the environment may affectvv and that assessing the direct effect of selection onvv requires holding fixed the environment, but reject his view that holding fixed the environment means holding fixed the average effects. This again raises the issue of what to count as environmental constancy (and thus change). In section 7, I argued that Fisher's notion of environmental change is theoretically defensible, by appeal to the gene's eye view of evolution. Whether or not this argument is accepted, we can say the following, //'we grant Fisher his conception of environmental change, then he has the resources to respond to Ewens' objection, by appeal to the two causal pathways idea. Therefore, the issue reduces to the question of what to count as environmental change, discussed previously. I submit, therefore, that Fisher is correct to describeAvvNs as the change directly caused by natural selection, given his conception of selective environ- ment. Ewens' point - that natural selection itself changes the average effects - is correct but does not show in itself that the causal gloss on the FTNS is wrong. Rather, it forces us to distinguish the direct from the indirect effects of natu- ral selection and to make clear that the FTNS concerns only the direct effect. Therefore, Ewens's point does not raise any additional problems for Fisher, over and above those that stem from his notion of environmental change. Finally, what about the biological significance of the FTNS? Above I argued that // the causal reading of the FTNS is correct then the theorem surely is significant, for it implies that when natural selection is the only force in operation, average fitness can never decline. However, given how Fisher defends the causal reading - by invoking two causal pathways - this argument needs re- considering. For by Fisher's lights, natural selection will almost never be the only force in operation19; for by causing gene frequencies to change, selection almost always induces environmental change, which is itself a force affecting average fitness. So why care about the direct effect of selection onvv? Surely it makes more sense to care about the total (direct plus indirect) effect, given that indirect effects are virtually ubiquitous. This consideration is an important one; it requires us to probe the issue of biological significance more deeply. 9 The Significance of the FTNS Re-considered In section 4, we looked briefly at the (alleged) significance of the FTNS. As we saw, Fisher himself thought that the FTNS was a highly general result about evolution by natural selection, and one that conferred a kind of directionality 19 Except when the average effects are independent of gene frequency; see section 6.</page><page sequence="27">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 345 on the evolutionary process. Other theorists, though not Fisher, have taken the FTNS to provide a justification for the adaptive landscape metaphor and for regarding natural selection as a 'force for the good', driving a population to higher and higher mean fitness. (However, these theorists were typically operating with the traditional rather than the modern interpretation of the FTNS, and as we have seen, under the traditional interpretation the theorem is not true.) In the light of the modern interpretation and the complexities discussed above, what become of these issues? What is the real significance of the FTNS? Interestingly, proponents of the modern interpretation disagree among them- selves on this question. Both Price ([1972]) and Ewens ([1989]) felt that the FTNS, though mathematically correct, did not have the biological significance that Fisher claimed for it. Ewens, as we have seen, objected to Fisher's thesis that the partial changeAwNs is the change 'due to' natural selection; similarly, Price objected to Fisher's treating non-additive gene effects as 'environmental'. However, Edwards ([1994]), Frank and Slatkin ([1992]) and Grafen ([2003]), the main recent proponents of the modern interpretation, are much more sym- pathetic to Fisher. Indeed, Grafen says that the FTNS 'isolated the adaptive engine in evolution and made an extraordinary link between gene frequen- cies and adaptive change. It really did show how Darwinian natural selection worked simply and consistently and persistently amid the maelstrom of com- plexities of population genetics. The theorem is just as important today for that reason' ([2003], p. 327). Grafen's optimistic assessment, in particular his claim that the FTNS tells us something interesting about adaptive change, contrasts sharply with the view expressed by Price. Price thought that the FTNS was 'by no means a trivial, uninteresting result', but he expressed dissatisfaction that the theorem implies nothing about the total change in average fitness ([1972], p. 139). The theorem tells us that in a constant environment, selection can only drive average fitness up; but since the environment, in Fisher's sense, is always changing, nothing follows about whether average fitness will actually increase or not. Thus Price wrote: what Fisher's theorem tells us is that natural selection ... at all times acts to increase the fitness of a species to live under the conditions that existed an instant earlier. But since the standard of 'fitness' changes from instant to instant, this constant improving tendency of natural selection does not necessarily get anywhere in terms of increasing 'fitness' as measured by any fixed standard, and in fact M [mean fitness] is about as likely to decrease under natural selection as to increase. ([1972], p. 131) Clearly, this assessment is at odds with Grafen's view that Fisher's theorem 'isolated the adaptive engine in evolution'; for in effect, Price is saying that the theorem teaches us nothing about adaptation.</page><page sequence="28">346 Samir Okasha I suggest that the disagreement between Price and Grafen turns ultimately on the acceptability of the gene's eye view of evolution. If we are fully committed to gene's eye thinking, and thus take seriously the idea that any change in genetic composition constitutes a change in the selective environment, we should favour Grafen's rather than Price's assessment of the FTNS. Of course, Price's point that the FTNS does not guarantee that average fitness will increase over time is correct, but no mathematical theorem could guarantee that, given that fitness depends on the environment, which is itself a variable. The most we could hope for is a theorem which tells us how selection will affect average fitness in a fixed environment - which Fisher has provided. The fact that the environment is constantly changing, and doing so in part because of natural selection, does not affect the key lesson of the FTNS - that natural selection is an optimizing process relative to a given environmental state. However, if we regard the gene's eye view as merely a useful heuristic, rather than a literally true description of the evolutionary process, we will incline towards Price's assessment. For then, we will regard Fisher's conception of environmental change as simply artificial, lacking theoretical justification, which means that the partial change is of no biological interest. So Price's complaint - that the total change is as likely to be positive as negative for all the FTNS tells us - will seem well taken. If this is correct, then some of the disagreements about the significance of the FTNS reduce to the issue of how literally we should take the gene's eye description of evolution, discussed previously. This complex issue cannot be resolved here, though my own opinion is that the gene's eye view can be taken literally, and thus that the partial change in mean fitness that the FTNS describes is biologically significant in the way Grafen describes. What about the purported directionality that the FTNS confers on the evo- lutionary process, and the analogy with the second law of thermodynamics? In the light of the modern interpretation of the FTNS, the analogy must surely be rejected. For the FTNS does not imply that the average fitness of an evolv- ing population will increase, while the second law does imply that the entropy of a closed thermodynamical system will increase. At most, the FTNS shows that selection tends to drive average fitness higher, but the tendency will of- ten be frustrated by 'environmental deterioration', itself partially caused by selection.20 Therefore, the directionality of the evolutionary process is only ap- parent. Evolution by natural selection does not actually have an arrow of time; from a sequence of successive state descriptions of an evolving population one could not deduce the direction of time, as one could from a sequence of state descriptions of a closed thermodynamical system. In Fisher's defence, it should 20 Thus Price spoke of the 'paradox of M tending always to increase and yet staying generally close to zero' ([1972], p. 1 39). ('AT is the mean Malthusian parameter, the continuous-time analogue of mean fitness.) Price's reason for saying that M usually stays close to zero is empirical- otherwise, the population would either rapidly go extinct or explode in numbers.</page><page sequence="29">Fisher 's Fundamental Theorem of Natural Selection 347 be noted that he himself stressed the limitations of the analogy between the FTNS and the second law; later commentators were the ones responsible for promoting the idea that the analogy is deep and interesting, an idea which must be rejected, in the light of the modern interpretation. What about the purported link between the FTNS and the 'hill-climbing' view of evolution, enshrined in the adaptive landscape concept? As noted in section 4, Fisher himself insisted that that the link is spurious and was deeply opposed to Wright's use of the adaptive landscape; again, it was other commentators who argued that the FTNS vindicates the 'evolution as hill- climbing' idea. In the light of the modern interpretation of the FTNS, Fisher's view on this matter may seem correct - since the average fitness of an evolving population does not always increase, there is no justification for thinking that natural selection will drive a population up peaks in the adaptive landscape, nor therefore for trying to deduce the evolutionary dynamics from the landscape's topography. However, this is not end of the matter, for the following reason. Any adap- tive landscape is implicitly relativized to a particular environment, for without such relativization, a population's mean fitness cannot plausibly be treated as a function of its genotypic composition. So when the environment of a pop- ulation changes, its adaptive landscape will change too. This means that the FTNS, on the modern interpretation, provides a sort of rationale for 'evolution as hill-climbing'. For as we have seen, the FTNS teaches us that in a fixed en- vironment, where this is understood in Fisher's specific sense, natural selection will increase population mean fitness. Of course, the environment in Fisher's sense will not remain fixed, for selection itself alters it, so the adaptive land- scape will continually be shifting. But this is conceptually unproblematic, given the implicit environmental relativity of all adaptive landscapes. The picture we are left with is therefore this. Natural selection does indeed continually drive populations up the nearest peak in the adaptive landscape, in the direction of higher mean fitness, but it simultaneously causes the landscape itself to change, and nothing general can be said about what the combined effect of these two causes will be, on either the magnitude or direction of the change in mean fitness. I suggest, therefore, the link between the FTNS and the adaptive landscape view of evolution can be partially retained, on the modern interpretation. Evolution by natural selection does involve a kind of hill-climbing; it is just that the landscape is continually being re-configured as the population evolves. Of course, this is still compatible with Fisher's insistence that Wright was wrong to appeal to the FTNS in support of his view of evolution. For Wright thought that the FTNS provided a mathematical basis for viewing evolution as a process of hill-climbing on a static landscape, but this would only be correct if the FTNS were true under the traditional interpretation, which it is not.</page><page sequence="30">348 Samir Okasha To conclude, under the modern interpretation, the FTNS remains a result of some biological significance, though perhaps less than seems at first sight. It stands as a highly general evolutionary principle, which holds true of any Mendelian population undergoing evolution by natural selection; by contrast, most other generalizations about the Darwinian process only hold true under restricted conditions, or as approximations. Precisely how much importance we should attach to the FTNS depends on whether we accept Fisher's definition of environmental change, for this lies at the crux of his argument; I have suggested that this in turn depends on our attitude towards the gene's eye view of evolution and the attendant notion of 'genie environment'. That there exists this close conceptual link between the FTNS and the gene's eye viewpoint is the main conclusion of the foregoing analysis, and one which highlights the enduring relevance of Fisher's ideas for contemporary evolutionary theory.
