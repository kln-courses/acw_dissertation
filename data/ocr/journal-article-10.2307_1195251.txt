<plain_text><page sequence="1">BUDDHISM IN CHINA--A HISTORICAL SKETCH KENNETH J. SAUNDERS Pacific School of Religion, Berkeley, California This article is a continuation of the study published in the March issue of the Journal of Religion, and gives an interpretation of the important ideals and teachings which emerged from the penetration of Buddhism into China. II A previous article' ended with the mention of three great schools of Chinese Buddhism-that of Bodhidharma who landed in China in 520, that of Chi-i a little later, and the Tantric or Mantra school of the eighth century. The present article attempts a survey of the important teachings and ideals of these schools. The first of them was introduced, or at least popularized, in the neighborhood of Loyang by Bodhidharma, or Puti Tamo, a prince of South India, who was the twenty- eighth patriarch of the Sangha. Disgusted perhaps at the course of things in his own hand, where Buddhism was becoming a Tantric Hindu cult, he came by the sea route to Ningpo. He was a picturesque figure, and has laid a strong hold upon the Chinese mind. His swarthy, bearded face, staring eyes, and gnarled limbs are a popular motive in Japanese art, from the kakemono of temple and teahouse to the sword-hilt of the Samurai; and he is still the beau ideal, if the paradox be allowed, of every monk in China! In Korea, I felt that I was really making progress when I was greeted as a "Tamo" from the West! A Japanese disciple says: He was however not a missionary to be favourably received by the public . . . . entirely different in every point from a popular missionary of our age. The latter would smile or try to smile at every face he ' Journal of Religion, March, 1923. 256</page><page sequence="2">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 257 happened to see, and would talk sociably: the former would not smile at any face, but would stare at it with huge glaring eyes that pierced to the innermost soul. The latter would keep himself scrupulously clean, shav- ing, combing, brushing, polishing, oiling, perfuming; whilst the former would be entirely indifferent as to his apparel, being always clothed in a faded yellow robe. The latter would compose his sermons with great care, making use of rhetorical art, and speak with force and elegance, while the former would sit silent as a bear, and kick off any who approached him with idle questions.' We might perhaps more fitly contrast Tamo with his great contemporary Columba in the Far West, "from whose gentle nest at Iona the doves of peace and goodwill were soon to wing their flight to all regions," or indeed with the gentle Punna and Mahinda and other pioneers of the Buddhist Sangha. Yet Tamo was not less devoted, and his influence to this day is in many ways unique. His Master Gotama, embracing poverty, writing no book and trusting in no organization, has won the enthusiastic admiration of mankind: Tamo, without speaking, except to be rude, has laid a strange spell upon the East. It captured first the Emperor Wu-ti at his capital K'ien-K'ang. Receiving the strange traveler with courtesy, he began to tell of the service he had rendered to the faith: "We have built temples, multiplied the Scriptures, encouraged many to join the Order: is there not much merit in all this ?" "None," was the blunt reply. "But what say the Holy Books--do they not promise rewards for such deeds ?" " There is nothing holy." "But-you yourself, are you not one of the holy ones?" "I don't know." "Who then are you?" "I don't know." "The elephant can hardly keep company with rabbits," says Mr. Nukariya. And indeed the books are full of exhorta- tion to the wise to wander lonely as the elephant, and Tamo was of the Arhat rather than the Bodhisattva type; but the Emperor Wu-ti was no rabbit,2 and there is surely more than I K. Nukariya, The Religion of the Samurai, pp. 5-6. 2Already a staunch Buddhist, he later persisted in taking the vows of a monk.</page><page sequence="3">258 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION mere rudeness in Tamo's reply. First, he tries to show that merit and truth are within, as Mr. Nukariya has so clearly and forcibly argued; then he goes on to prepare his pupil for the doctrine of anattI. Unless we are ourselves enlightened, observances and the Scriptures themselves are of no avail; and the first step in enlightenment is to realize the unreality of the "ego." "To seek aught outside thine own heart and mind is to grasp the air. Prayers, alms, learning, zeal-what good are they? All are unreal." That this is the meaning of Tamo's reply to the Emperor seems clear from another very popular story of him. An inquirer came to him, and stood silent before him: the sage took no notice, and so a week went by, till the seeker, as the tears dropped frozen on his breast, to prove his sincerity, drew his sword and cut off an arm. "Well, what is it ?" "Master, my soul is sore troubled. Help me pacify it." "Where is it ?" "I cannot find it, though I have sought it earnestly for years." "There, I have pacified it for you," said the sage, and a flash of intuition revealed to the seeker, faint though he was with loss of blood, the truth that was discovered by Gotama and forgotten by the masses of his followers. Tamo came to call them back to orthodoxy, and the effect of his teaching, or absence of teaching, was profound: "It was the introduction, not of the dead Scriptures . . . . but of a living faith; not of any theoretical doctrine but of practical enlightenment, not of the idea of Buddha but of the spirit of Sakyamuni."' Yet the Buddhism of Tamo was different, indeed, from the Buddhism of Gotama, and has been called a kind of Vedanta. It finds a cosmic significance in the Buddha nature, immanent in all men and things. This is the sole reality, and gives a meaning to the world, and to men an understanding of its true nature. By intuitive rather than discursive reason, man grasps'this truth, and it can only be imparted from mind to ' Nukariya, op. cit.</page><page sequence="4">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 259 mind and from heart to heart by intuition. So it has come down in unbroken succession from Sakyamuni to all the patriarchs, of whom Kasyapa was first; Ananda, second; Parsva, tenth; Asvaghosa, twelfth; Nigarjuna, fourteenth; Vasubandhu, twenty-first; and Bodhidharma, twenty-eighth, to name only those of supreme eminence. The school relates the story of KRsyapa's appointment; Master and disciples were seated on the Vulture Peak, when the god Brahma drew near and offered a flower to the Blessed One, requesting him to preach the Law. He kept silence, and while all looked expectant, Kasyapa alone smiled in understanding. Are not the greatest things ineffable? So began an apostolic succes- sion, of which every name is treasured in a school that lays little stress on the Scriptures, and therefore must vindicate the authority of its verbal teachings. That of Tamo is accepted by all, and from his day the patriarchate descended to his Chinese followers. A discourse, purporting to be that of Tamo at the court of Wu-ti, has been translated into French by Father Wieger,' and though it is most unlikely that he ever delivered so full and rounded an exposition of his doctrine, and quite doubtful if he knew Chinese, it is worth study as a summary of Dhyina teaching. It says: The heart is Buddha. Outside of it there is no reality. Apart from thought all is unreal. There is neither cause nor effect apart from the mind and heart. Nirvana itself is a state of heart. See in thyself the true Buddha nature, know that thou art Buddha, and canst not sin. There is neither good nor bad, but only the heart, and this is Buddha and impeccable. .... One sin only is there, to ignore thine own Buddhahood. .... This ignorance it is which makes the wheel of transmigration to rotate: it is enlightenment which destroys the power of Karma. The enlightened can neither sin nor be reborn. 0 heart of man, so great that thou canst embrace the world, so little that thou canst not be touched by a needle's point-thou art Buddha. That is my word to China. I Croyances Religieuses etc. en Chine, p. 500.</page><page sequence="5">260 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION It might be Vivekananda or any other Vedantist speaking, and it is possible to hold with Father Wieger that Tamo was asked to leave by the Buddhists of South India; but those who could digest the Tantric Buddhism of a few decades later, were not squeamish, and this DhyEna teaching accords well enough with Mahayana pantheism, on the one hand, and with the mysticism of the founder, on the other, while the emphasis on enlightenment and on contemplation, as the way to it, is a clarion call to the pietist to "leave this chanting and singing and telling of beads" and to return to the rock from which he was hewn. The odious teaching, however, that good and evil are alike, is not Sakyamuni's, nor is it probable that Tamo pressed his pantheism to this conclusion. His followers, even where they have held this strange view, have done much to ennoble Chinese and Japanese life by attuning the mind to nature in her loveliest moods, and have blended the quietism of India with the poetic intuitionism of Southern China, till a Japanese authority can say it with conviction: "There is hardly a form of thought or a duty that Zen has not touched and inspired with its ideal of simple beauty."' In the first place, in its doctrine of pantheism, in finding the Buddha nature in all things, it brought religion into all life: The golden light upon the sunkist peaks, The water murmuring in the pebbly creeks, Are Buddha. In the stillness, hark, he speaks! This poetic quietism has laid its spell for more than two thousand years upon world-weary men and women; seeking the mountain tops, they have since the time of the Buddha possessed their souls amidst the beauties of nature. But the Dhyana school has appealed also to soldier and statesman in the midst of strenuous days. What has been its secret? In the first place, it has developed a joy in simple things, i M. Anesaki, Buddhist Art, p. 54.</page><page sequence="6">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 261 and has helped them to retreat, for a time at least, into a quiet kingdom of the mind, and to be free from life's trammels: Unanchored, riding free On the still clear waters, see In the calm cool air of night Doth float A tiny boat All bathed in silver light. Here, as it were in a cameo, is crystallized the coolness of the enlightened mind, calm and serene; like the moonlight beauti- fying all it touches; free as the little boat that rides unanchored on the waves. Here was a genuine religious experience, an intuition of the unity of all things, and often of the presence of the Buddha. There are many stories of sages of this school converted or enlightened by the croaking of a frog in the silence, the ripple of a stream, or the fall of autumn leaves. In all these the Buddha nature is immanent: A score of years I looked for Light; Passed many a Spring and Fall: But since the peach-bloom came in sight I nothing doubt at all. We find blended in these lovers of nature something of the delicacy of the blossom and the ruggedness of the mountain. With poetical insight went a spartan simplicity and an ascetic rigor of life, and in their hymns there is nothing of the somewhat effeminate pietism of some of the Amitabha schools. They are thinkers imbued with the idealism which transfigures nature, and to them images and scriptures are alike unnecessary: nature is at once their scripture and the embodiment of their god. We read, in fact, of sages of this school warming them- selves at a fire made of a wooden image of Buddha, or giving away the halo of a golden one to feed the poor.</page><page sequence="7">262 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION I have a Buddha-image, aye Though people see it not! Not made of cloth or clay, Nor carved in wood, I wot. 'Tis not by artist drawn, No thief it steals: One from Time's very dawn Itself reveals In myriad form This Buddha norm.' From their quietism, too, and counteracting the danger of their pantheism, they drew moral inspiration, for they read nature in the light of the Buddha teaching. Ye who seek for purity and peace go to Nature. She will give you more than ye ask. Ye who long for strength and perseverance go to Nature. She will train and strengthen you. Ye who aspire after an ideal go to Nature. She will help you in its realization. Ye who yearn after enlightenment go to Nature. She will never fail to grant your request." For man and nature are alike filled with the same universal spirit: "Unchanging and pure, eternally bright and clear is the Tathagatagarbha," says Kweifung. To be in unity with nature is to be in tune with eternal truth. Why then are so many folk foolish and perverse? They are like the drunkard who forgets the precious gems which he has in his own pocket. Drunk with egoism, they forget the true nature of the "ego," which is Buddhahood: Within me dwells my "self"; Yet ere this little "I" awoke, Came the free Buddha self And dwelt within.3 They are like the prodigal son of the Lotus Satra, who forgets his own rich heritage and goes to dwell in a far country; but at any moment they may "come to themselves," to find a z "Religion of the Samurai," Zen-gaku-tzi-ten, p. 93. 2 Nukariya, op. cit., p. 74. 3 From an anonymous Japanese poem.</page><page sequence="8">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 263 larger self than they had dreamed of, "the universal Buddha mind, which makes them one with nature and mankind." The school is neither absolutely idealistic nor absolutely nihilistic. For if the mind be unreal, who is it who knows that the world of phenomena is unreal? And if they be unreal what causes them to appear ? We are witnesses that there is no one of the fleeting and unreal things of earth but is made to appear by something real. If there be no real ocean, how can there be the transient and unreal waves? If there be no real mirror, how can there be images unreal and transient reflected in it ? If the dream be unreal, does it not at least imply a dreamer ?' Like Tientai, the Dhyina school teaches a pantheistic realism, and on this basis builds its systematic mind-training. By careful practice, the mind may be purified alike from destruction and from lust and egoism, and in this lies the secret of bodily as well as mental health. Being asked the secret of his own amazing vitality at the age of a hundred, an eighteenth- century master of this school replied: "Keep your mind and body pure for fourteen days, and I will tell you the secret." This injunction he repeated until he felt that the time had come to whisper in the inquirer's ear: "That is the secret. Keep free from passion. Keep that rule even at the cost of life." There is something whimsical in the school, derived no doubt from the quaint figure and methods of Tamo himself, which has endeared it especially to the Japanese, who never weary of stories illustrating the unorthodox manners of the Zen masters; they test the spiritual progress of their pupils by a sudden blow or an insult, and the sincerity of an inquirer by some gross bit of rudeness. Samurai, gathered about the camp fire, would love to tell of Tokiyori, who having invited a Zen master to visit him, and having welcomed him with charming courtesy, and an elegant poem, received in reply only a stunning blow; yet equal to the occasion he replied 'So says Tsung Mi.</page><page sequence="9">264 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION with a smile: "Your blessing, O Master, makes my whole body thrill and tingle with joy!" And as they prepared to die on the field of battle, they would compose terse and charm- ing poems, which often express with a simple elegance the ideals of Zen. Of this tradition, the latest and most notable example is that of the late General Nogi, who met the news of the death of his two sons with calm resignation, and immediately com- posed a poem in their honor, and who not long afterward sought his own death with the same stoical detachment. With the more intricate things of the mind-culture of this school, it must suffice to note the system of Koans, which are its unique feature; dark sayings or paradoxes, by which the mind, puzzled at first, learns to desert the ordinary processes of thought, to acquire a new point of view, and to develop its powers of intuition.' In an exquisite room, in the midst of a peaceful courtyard where no sound entered except the murmur of the brook, I consulted a Zen abbot as to how one might set about practicing the mind-culture of the school; "No one can help you," was his reply; "you must find enlightenment yourself." This is of course the answer I expected. The mystic cannot explain. As a Chinese textbook of the school says, "Only he who has tasted salt knows what salt tastes like. If you want to know, taste! . . . . There is a teaching which cannot be taught." And not unlike this phase of Buddhist mysticism is the great saying of a Christian contem- porary of Tamo: "By love He may be gotten; by thought of understanding, never." But the abbot went on to give me one of the first of the Koans: "Listen," he said, "for the sound of a single hand" ;2 and when I smiled: "You had better go," he said, "to one of the simpler and more popular sects." I felt, I The answer to these Koans must be given in a word, which adds to their difficulty. 2*This famous Koan is attributed to Hakuin (1685-1768). When it has been mastered, it is followed by another: "Hark to the sound of a single hand on Mount Fujiyama"; and a third, "If you are dead and without form, produce the sound of a single hand."</page><page sequence="10">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 265 be it confessed, that the abbot was true to type, and entered into the feelings of many an inquirer who has received a shrewd blow in return for his importunity. Another such elementary Koan is the question "What is your original face, even before you were born ?" and like all such questions it aims at "laying the axe to the root of our everyday experience in order to build up a new order of things on the basis of Zen," as D. T. Suzuki expresses it. Other Koans are in the form of anecdotes of Zen masters, whose replies to inquirers are unintelligible to the ordinary mind. In answer to the question "Why did Tamo leave India and come to China?" the master Joshu (778-897) replied, "The cypress tree in the courtyard," which served also as his statement of the ultimate principle in Buddhism! When asked, "Has the dog Buddha nature ?" "Non-existent" was his answer. Similarly, Tungshan (806-69), being asked, "Who is the Buddha ?" answered, "A pound of flax." If we attempt to rationalize these statements, we receive another slap! "Under no circumstances," says Dr. Suzuki, "ought Zen to be con- founded with philosophy." Abandon logic and reasoning, let intuition have free play, all of you who would enter its quiet haunts. For consciousness is clogged with the rubbish of our daily life, till the Zen physician has given us his drastic mental purgatives: then only is the subconscious free to send us its truth. Such is the system as practiced in Japan, and though Chinese Chan Buddhism has not so fully developed the system of Koan or Kung-ang, yet its followers are trained by these and by Zazen-systematic contemplation and reverie, in which, while many need to remember the word of Sakyamuni, "Torpor is not the same as Aryan silence," yet there are some who soar on the wings of intuitive insight to truth: and to such many miracles are attributed. Like Tamo, they can walk upon the waves and "know all mysteries."</page><page sequence="11">266 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Tamo then stood for a Buddhism simplified and austere.' His younger contemporary and pupil, Chi-i, attempted the more difficult task of harmonizing the complex elements, devotional and philosophical, which Tamo rejected. South of Ningpo is the beautiful range of T'ien-t'ai, and here Chi-i studied and travailed to bring forth a new and comprehensive Buddhism, subordinating philosophy to devo- tion, yet giving it due recognition. He was indeed a mighty thinker, whose masterly, if arbitrary, genius brought order out of the chaos of the schools. Their philosphical teachings ranged from a naive realism to an absolute nihilism, and it is the glory of the T'ien-t'ai school that it reconciled, in a middle path, the imperious demands at once of common sense and of idealistic thought. The phenomenal world is real, for immanent in it is the tathata or absolute. Here is a pantheistic realism, in which both relative and absolute are parts of an eternal process and causally related. The relative is at once identical with, and different from, the absolute, which is self-dependent. Here Chi-i is blending the idealism of Asvaghosa and of Nagarjuna, whom he regarded as his master, with the devo- tional teaching of the Lotus, that all have inherent in them the Buddha nature. He seized on this identification of the Bodhi with cosmic truth, and worked it out as a systematic and devotional creed. Though the absolute is unknowable, yet it is attainable in meditation, and is the underlying reality or Dhammatd, which alone gives reality to this empty world. The historical Buddha is the embodiment of this universal reality, which though it is eternal is dependent upon them for its realization: "the truth [tathd] is a mere. abstraction, a dead name, unless there appears a tathdgata in concrete human life."* i It is noteworthy that his school, while it failed to win the less poetic North, established itself firmly in the South of China, where it gave rise to five subsects in the eighth century. 2 M. Anesaki, Nichiren, p. 151.</page><page sequence="12">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 267 Thus the historical Buddha is the adaptation of the eternal truth to human needs. Chi-i now drew out what is implicit in the Lotus, and argued that there is in all men a corresponding adaptation; for each is a "son of man" in whom the universal truth is particularized, and in whom there is a glorified body, representing the spiritual influence which passes out from him. So, too, with all sentient beings, from demons tormented by their own vices to Buddhas who by their virtues lead many to truth-in all is this threefold nature inherent. In addition to the Lotus, Chi-i makes much of the Nirvdna Sfitra and of the PrajfTdpdramita Sastra of Nagarjfna, seeking by an ingenious but quite fanciful division of the life of the founder into five periods to account for their diversities of doctrine. It is one thing to hold that there was some develop- ment of doctrine during the founder's own lifetime, and quite another to follow the ingenious harmonist as he works out his "Five Periods": and it is interesting to discover a Japanese higher critic as early as 1744 pointing out the arbitrariness of the arrangement. The first period was according to Chi-i a few weeks after the enlightenment, when the Buddha was busy instructing gods and a limited circle of other celestial beings, who alone could understand him. The Avatamsaka SLtra contains these teachings and this is the name given to this period.' Next came a time of accommodation to human needs, which lasted twelve years, during which the Theravdda teachings were given. It is known as the Agama period. The Vaipulya is a period of eight years, when men had grown in the faith and were ready for the Bodhisattva in place of the Arhat ideal, ready for altruism in place of self-culture. Then to reconcile these Mahdydna doctrines with those of Agamas, the wise teacher spent twenty-two years, the I This Satra is certainly not milk for babes: it contains, however, valuable meta- physical statements of the One who alone is Himself undifferentiated, yet dwelling in all and working in all to bring them to Nirvana.</page><page sequence="13">268 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION Prajaidpdramita period, arguing that there was no real gulf between them: they are stages of one journey. Lastly, in the fulness of time, when he was seventy-two years old, he revealed the sublime truth that all may attain Buddhahood. This period lasted eight years and its doctrine is to be found in the Lotus and Nirvdna Satras. With its completion, the teacher's work was done and he was free to enter Nirvdna. As to its moral teachings, T'ien-t'ai Buddhism is not so original. Chi-i wrote a commentary on the Bodhisattva, and accepted the usual moral system of Mahdydna, but to the twin foundation stones of Prajad, wisdom and Dhydna, meditation, he gave a new connotation. The true wisdom is to realize that passion is itself enlightenment and that Samsdra is itself Nirvdna: to meditate on this is the fruit of meditation on the "Three Truths," that all is empty and the world unreal, that the Dharmas of the phenomenal world are real because they are a manifestation in time of the eternal, and that they are neither real nor unreal, for being conditioned they are real in the sense that their existence is empty of real worth and mean- ing. So by the middle path Chi-i follows Nagarjuna, only to arrive at the same barren paradox of the pantheist that good and evil, transmigration and its end, passion and enlighten- ment, are identical; all are real because all are manifestations of the universal life, and only real when so viewed sub specie aeternitatis. It is to the credit of Chi-i that he refused to take a step which some of his followers took, and to go on to obliterate all moral distinctions; though he did not make sila, morality, fundamental, yet he laid great stress upon it. As to the method of progress toward enlightenment there are six stages: (I) men are ignorant of the Three Truths; (2) they know them, but do not meditate upon them; (3) they begin to meditate upon them; (4) they attain insight, but their passions are not subdued; (5) they reach a negative</page><page sequence="14">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 269 illumination by destruction of ignorance; (6) they reach full and positive illumination by grasping the doctrine of the Middle Path. So only are they distinguished from the other Dharmas, of which Chi-i enumerates three thousand. All contain the Buddha-nature; it is only enlightened men of this sixth stage who realize it and claim it for themselves. In them only does Cosmic Truth come to self-consciousness. But as it is embodied in each it is present in its fulness in a single thought, and even a hungry spirit in hell has in his every thought the full three thousand Dharmas of the universe. Such is the system of Chi-i, which in its view of the Absolute coming after a long process of evolution to self-consciousness, anticipates Hegel, and is saner in maintaining that it is only enlightened human nature as seen in the Buddhas which can be regarded as the true revelation of the eternal. Is this tathata personal? "Such terms," Chi-i would answer, "are all relative; words limited by our human experi- ence cannot describe the Absolute." But, like Kant, he would distinguish between the practical and the pure reason, and leave the devotee to conceive of the Supreme as personal. And the two great scriptures of T'ien-t'ai speak in such language: "All living beings are my children"; says the Lotus, "I alone can save them"; "The love of the Buddha," says the Nirvdna Satra, "is equable toward all. But as a father, though he has seven children, yearns over one that is sick, so doth the Buddha hover about those who are in sin." Just as Gotama taught of a Karma so exact and just as to seem like a providence, so.the later Schoolmen of the Mahdydna, themselves not anthropomorphic in their thinking of the eternal, speak of the "loving heart," the "supreme wisdom," and even the "eternal Fatherhood" of the Dharmakaya. Immanent in the world of things and in the mind of man the Dharmakdya is yet transcendent, greater even than the revelation of himself manifested in the Buddhas.</page><page sequence="15">270 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION In 597, as Augustine was setting up the standard of the cross at Canterbury, died Chi-i, philosopher, harmonist, may we not say theologian, on his beloved mountain, and left about a score of works to carry on his teachings. His posthumous name is "The great wise teacher," and his influence has been great. His three most important works are a commentary on the Lotus, an introduction to it, and a work on meditation and knowledge. A third great division of Chinese Buddhism is that known as Tantric. Neither the intuitionism of Tamo nor the compre- hensive and difficult system of Chi-i could expect to win the allegiance of the masses and there is ample evidence to show that they did not seek it; theirs was a monastic Mahdyana. In this, at any rate, it was true to type. But in South India, Bodhidharma must have met the degenerate popular cult of a Buddhism that was paying the price of compromise, and by permitting the worship of Hindu deities was losing its soul. It may well be for this reason that he left his own land and went to China, though some critics hold that he was driven out by the orthodox because he was himself becoming too much of a Hindu! However this may be, the Yogachdra of Asanga seems to have opened the door to other Hindu practices, until almost all that distinguishes Buddhism from Saivite Hinduism was sacrificed. The men responsible for introducing this mongrel cult to China were Subhakara, Vajrabodhi, and Amogha, all from Southern India.' But the way had been paved by the magical practices of Taoism, by a treatise of Asanga translated in the sixth century, and, negatively, by the failure of Confucian ethics and Buddhist philosophy to satisfy the religious needs of the masses. We must not take too dark a view of this Mantra school. It has done much for art," and if its pantheism 1 Vajrabodhi came to China in 719, and his nephew Amoghavajra, in 746. 2 As Dr. Anesaki has shown, this school is noted at once for its "delicate painting and vigorous sculpture" (Buddhist Art, p. 36). The art of the Heian period of Japan (8oo--iIO A.D.) is characterized by a unique sense of intimate communion with the gods, by a remarkable symbolism, and a marvelous precision. Cf. Okakura, Les Ideaux de l'Orient, pp. 131-33-</page><page sequence="16">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 271 has on the one hand lent itself to sensuality, it has on the other kept alive the sense of a divine order penetrating and animating the world. It is at its best a cosmotheistic idealism, seeing all things as a sacrament. Some of the new deities, too, were worthy of a place in the devotion of this heart-hungry people. Vairochana, for instance, was identified with the sun, who has long held an honored place in the "universism" of China; and now he begins to compete with Omitofo or Amitabha Buddha for the "presidency" among the gods. His miadra-the fingers of one hand encircling the index finger of the other-typifies the union of the individual with the cosmic soul, and the idealistic schools had prepared the Chinese mind for this teaching. Vairochana, "the Cosmic Lord, is not a mere spirit. His body is the whole of material existence, and even a grain of dust partakes of his spiritual life and owes its existence to him. The whole world is a living organism, manifesting its life everywhere and endeavouring to attain full self-consciousness in every particle."', Another great figure popularized by the Mantra school is Bhesajyaraja, or Yoshi-fo, the healing Buddha, who like Vairochana is a dhydni-Buddha, revealing hidden truth, and familiar to the student of Chinese temples as one of the great Buddhas who are seated upon the high altar. Among the titles of S5kyamuni is that of "Physician of the Soul," and Yoshifo is worshiped as healer of physical as well as spiritual ills; while one of his manifestations Binzuru is very popular in Japan, where his image, in wood, sits outside the shrine, and is an undoubted source of disease through contagion: for the devotee touches Binzuru on the spot which is affected in himself, until he becomes a veritable plague center. But the idea is good. ' Anesaki, Buddhist Art, p. 32. Less pleasing deities are Achala (Jap. Fudj), the. "immovable," type of wisdom and meditation, a form of Vairochana; and Aizen of Kongosaltta, a god of love.</page><page sequence="17">272 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION There are also dhydni-bodhisattvas such as Vajrapani, who symbolizes power, and Titsang (Kshitigarbha),' who presides over the earth and makes a strong appeal to human needs. He is vanquisher of hell, and protector of children-surely a noble conception of the divine. Buddhist art delights to paint him descending to the underworld, with children crowding round to welcome him; and one of the most touching sights in Japan is a Jiz6 shrine, where parents are busy tying the tiny garments of some dead child about the images of this strong and tender champion. I have a little family shrine, in which naked infants are playing leapfrog as he comes and offering their lilies to him, and this whimsical note is very characteristic of Buddhist art, one of the hall marks of its genius and inspira- tion. Men, and especially women, cannot do without such deities or such aspects of the divine, and the new school throve apace: for twelve centuries it has played a great part in popu- larizing Buddhism, and though there is much crude superstition in its dhdrani, or charms, which the priests do not pretend to understand, yet this has rather added to its success; the people love to be mystified. And the government itself, in these early days, seems to have supported the new missionaries, sending Amogha back to India to secure more Sanskrit texts and to study its elaborate symbolism. He returned, after five years, armed with new knowledge. Among the rites in use today are masses for the dead, a form of baptism based upon the consecration rite of Indian kings, incantations against demons, fire offerings, and other bits of ancient Vedic ritual. These met a felt need in China, and local color was added in the form of charms against mandarins, and the brigands who have always been a curse to this long-suffering land! To all this was added the charm of secrecy. Men told one another in whispers 1 "Earth Womb," a reference perhaps to the widespread belief in a Limbo for the dead, situated in the womb of earth.</page><page sequence="18">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 273 that the Day of Milei-fa, Maitri Buddha, was at hand, and with it a new era. The secrecy of the new movement however roused the suspicion of the government till it was proscribed, but it flourished the more vigorously, and though today it has been absorbed into the more orthodox Chan school, yet it has left its mark on both popular and monastic Buddhism, and is represented in the Lama temples so common in Northern China, though these have been introduced from Mongolia and Tibet. That the Tantric school was strongly intrenched at Changan, in the ninth century, is clear, for the Japanese scholar Kukai, after studying there for three years, took it back to his native land, and there it flourishes and may best be studied on the beautiful mountain, K6ya San. In these early centuries of its history in China, it seems to have been free from the phallic symbolism and the priestly quackery of its later years, and its adherents to have lived moral and even austere lives, and done much to make Buddhism a power among the common people. CONCLUSION Chinese Buddhism is a complex product of these and the Amitabha schools. Decadent as it undoubtedly is in many parts of the country, it has had an immense influence upon the civilization of this great people, beautifying it and helping to make it the pacific and kindly thing it is. Nor are there wanting here, as elsewhere, signs of a real awakening. In the early eighties, a literary revival in China turned men's eyes to the Buddhist books, the beauty of whose language is still unsurpassed. In 1893, a lay Buddhist from Ceylon did something to awake the monks of China from their torpor, and in the past two decades there has been a great activity in building at such places as Ningpo and Hangchow, and since</page><page sequence="19">274 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION the revolution many disillusioned men are seeking the quiet monastic retreats of Buddhism, as many as a thousand being ordained recently at one time in the city of Changchow. The training of these ordinands is improving, and there are among them some of real piety and devotion. Among laymen, too, there is an increasing interest in the philosophy of Buddhism; bookstores in the great cities stock from five hundred to a thousand different texts and commentaries; and magazines like the New Buddhism voice the interest of groups of the younger men who have reacted against the influence of nomi- nally Christian nations, and the impossible theology of a very large and devoted company of Christian missionaries, whose own characters are far more noble than that of the god they feel constrained to preach., Japanese influence is moreover at work, seeking to demon- strate the power of Buddhism to become once more an inter- national bond between the peoples of Asia. In 1918, a pan-Buddhist movement started in Tokyo provoked a counter- move, in the form of a Buddhist organization in Peking, to combat Japanese influence, and the younger politicians look pensively at Buddhism as it offers itself as a basis for the new democracy. Speaking more generally, there is an earnest endeavor being made to clothe Buddhism in modern garments, and to adapt it to modern needs, while philosophy clubs and popular lectures are making this "new thought" available to the masses. And on the practical side there are good efforts to do what Christian missions have so nobly demonstrated to be an essential part of true religion, in the relief of famine, in Red Cross work, in prison visitation, and care for the infirm. Here, as in India, the power of Christ is shown as vividly in the revival of the old faiths through contact with his spirit, as in the actual conversion of great numbers of the people. 1 For example, one very large and influential mission teaches that God condemns to eternal conscious torture all who have never heard of him: and dismisses any of its people who boggle at this! No Buddhist shrine would admit so truculent a god.</page><page sequence="20">BUDDHISM IN CHINA 275 If the future religion of China is to be Christianity, as it may well be, it will surely be a Christianity to which Buddhism has made notable contributions. He who knows Amitaibha, Kwaryin, and Titsang is ready to know God in Christ: and his new knowledge will surely be colored by that which has prepared the way for it. This acceptance of the Logos phi- losophy has long since won many a Chinese, whether Taoist or Buddhist in name, to the doctrine of God and man set forth in the Johannine writings.</page></plain_text>
