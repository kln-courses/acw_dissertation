<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL'S ROUTE THROUGH MYSIA A NOTE ON ACTS XVI. 8 The route which the Apostle Paul took through Mysia to Troas during the course of his second missionary tour, as reported in Acts xvi, 1 Ο: Gen. χχ. 8; xxiii. ίο, 13, 16; xliv. 18; 1. 4; Exod. x. 2; xi. 2; xvii. 14; xxiv. 7; Deut. v. 1; xxxi. 28, 30; xxxii. 44; and PsJ: Gen. xx. 8; Exod. xxiv. 7; Deut. v. 1. 2 PsJ, N, and FT generally render the phrase 'in the hearing of' (_במשמעיה ד), as does the modern English R.S.V. In fact, the paraphrastic translation 'in the hearing of' is so common in N, that one of the glossators has added it in the margin of that Ms., in a verse that has intended real ears of flesh and blood. The case in point is Gen. xxxv. 4, 'And the rings that were on their ears', which is correctly translated in a literal fashion by all of the targums. The thoughtless gloss to N, 'that were in their hearing', is of course a hypercorrection. 3 Cf. J. Shunary, 'Avoidance of Anthropomorphism in the Τ argum of Psalms', Textus 5 (1966), 139, note 16.</page><page sequence="2">508 NOTES AND STUDIES involves a puzzle the significance of which does not appear to have received sufficient notice. Acts xvi. 6-10 reports that curious sequence of starts and stops and redirections by which Paul was channelled from southern Galatia right across Asia Minor north-westward to Macedonia.1 Scholars continue to debate the actual geographical movements suggested by Acts xvi. 6, where Paul, following his revisitation in southern Galatia, passed through την Φρυγίαν καϊ Γαλατικην χωράν, either before or after being prevented 'by the Holy Spirit' from preaching in provincial Asia. But there is general agreement that when later, 'opposite Mysia', the mis sionary party was not allowed by 'the Spirit of Jesus' to enter Bithynia (Acts xvi. 7), they must by then have been in the vicinity of Dorylaeum and Cotiaeum2 in west-central Asia Minor. From this point the account in Acts traces out Paul's movements with the simple statement: 'So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas' (Acts xvi. 8). But the simplicity of the statement is beguiling. One might be left with the notion that Paul, already twice blocked in his missionary intentions, now turns, perhaps not a little bewildered, and finds his way directly down to the near-by port of Τroas on the coast, there to await fresh guidance. This, at least, is the conventional impres sion in the modern literature. But the geographical details implied by Acts xvi. 8 are, on closer scrutiny, rather puzzling. A network of major roads converged in Roman times at Dorylaeum and Cotiaeum, from the north, the east, the south-east, the south, and the south-west.3 Troas, however, lay in none of these directions, but rather directly west, and more than two hundred miles away as the crow flies. And only crows could have gone directly. To the west of Dorylaeum and Cotiaeum lay the land of the Abrettene, one of the last enclaves of pre-Hellenic tribal life in that area, a rough and undeveloped region by standards of the day. Here, in the remote valleys of the Rhyndacus and its major tributary,4 settled patterns of provincial life only began to emerge in the time of Hadrian, who established the first cities there.5 More importantly, no significant east-west routes are 1 Haenchen, among others, argues that the report of movements in Acts xvi. 6-10 is based on authentic recollection (Acts, 485).

Munro some eighty years ago proposed a road running in Roman times from Cotiaeum through Hadrianeia and Hadrianutherae across to Scepsis and down the Scamander to Ilium and Troas.1 He rightly remarks that such a road would exactly have suited the indications of Paul's route in Acts xvi. 8. But he could suggest possible evidence only for the western stretch, for a road across the Troad from the headwaters of the Aesepus down the Scamander to the coast.2 He had no evidence for the eastern stretch and none has come to light since. According to Acts xvi. 8, Paul and his party turned, however, in just this direction, and therefore either left the major routes and made their way directly towards Troas over back roads and minor trails,3 or skirted Mysia to the north by the coastal road4 or to the south by the road to Pergamum.5 Which route Paul therefore used to get to Troas from the far side of Mysia is a puzzle. But the more significant puzzle, I propose, is not which route Paul used, but why he went to Troas. For the geographical conditions mean that, whichever way Paul went, from Dorylaeum and Cotiaeum he could only get to Troas either with difficulty or else circuitously.circuitously. Troas was neither close at hand, nor the terminus of a natural direct route, nor the nearest port. Why, then, from beyond eastern Mysia did Paul head for Troas? It is, once one pauses to attend to the starting point, and the available routes, a puzzling termination. 1 J. A. R. Munro and Η. M. Anthony, 'Explorations in Mysia', The Geogra phical Journalphical Journalphical Journal ix (1897) 150-69, 256-76 with a map opposite 248; note especially 256-8. 2 In fact material evidence exists today only for a road from the coast as far as Scepsis: J. M. Cook, The Troad (Oxford, 1973) 396-7. 3 So far as terrain is concerned, a trek through this eastern part would not have been formidable (a modern Turkish railroad now runs along the eastern stretch of the route suggested by Munro), so it is conceivable that Paul went straight through Mysia, finding minor trails through the eastern area and across the Troad to the road down the Scamander. To the north a road of some sort did exist down the valley of the Rhyndacus at some time in the Roman period. Ramsay supposed that Paul in part used this route, going on to Artemea and across to the Scamander (Empire, 76; Traveller, 197; cf. the map in Hastings, Dictionary Dictionary of the Bible, extra volume, after page 400). 4 The northern coastal road could be reached either via Prusa from Dorylaeum (but this would involve traversing part of Bithynia) or down the Rhyndacus from Cotiaeum. 5 So, apparently, E. A. Judge, 'Mysia', New Bible Dictionary, 856. The text reads παρελθόντες τψ Μυσίαν, which could be taken to mean that the party passed alongside of Mysia, in the sense of skirting it. Alternately it could mean that they passed by Mysia, in the sense of neglecting it. The word can also, however, be used merely for passing through a locality (the sense preferred in Arndt and Gingrich, Lexicon, 631, and Haenchen, Acts, 484, n. 4). D resolves the uncertainty by reading όιελθόντες instead. J.T.S. 2 L 1</page><page sequence="4">51ο NOTES AND STUDIES If Troas were the nearest port at hand for Paul, his going there might well suggest merely the intention to embark for some destination conventionally served by maritime traffic calling there. Troas was in fact a major intersection of important sea and land routes. Perhaps Paul had an eye on the lands about the Black Sea, or on Macedonia, or on Greece and the lands beyond, or on Alexandria and the African coast; or perhaps he now considered returning home to Syria.1 Troas could have offered ready access to all these destinations. But in fact Troas was not the nearest port. And the ports which were nearer, and more convenient to a traveller setting out from east of Mysia, would have been able to serve almost all the intentions that more distant Troas might. Transport to some land about the Black Sea could be more quickly met at Cyzicus to the north. A return to Syria by sea, or a mission to the African coast, would bring into consideration first of all the traffic down the coast of western Asia Minor, which could be met up with in Adramyttium, and, if not there, then most naturally in the harbours along the coast road to the south. The natural route to Greece would normally also involve use of this coastal traffic as far as Ephesus, where one could make connections with the regular trans-Aegean shipping to Corinth. But Paul either deliberately did not go near any of these ports, taking an unnatural route directly across country to Troas, or he deliberately passed by or through some of them on his circuitous way to Troas. Only one intention could not have been served more quickly and conveniently by some other terminus. The one thing Paul would not have expected as easily or more easily to find in one of these more readily accessible ports as he could expect to find in Troas was transport to Macedonia.2 1 So, e.g. W. L. Knox, Jerusalem, 243, 248, n. 12; Haenchen, Acts, 486-7; C. S. C. Williams, Acts, 193. 2 After writing up the substance of this material, I found that Dr. Colin Hemer was also studying the same puzzling information of Acts xvi. 8, in con nection with his research on Troas, and we compared notes to mutual benefit. Hemer's work has subsequently been published: ,Alexandria Troas', Tyndale Bulletin,Bulletin, xxvi (197s) 79-112. In this characteristically thorough and instructive article, Hemer places Troas firmly within its ancient geographical and com mercial context. On the question of Paul's route through Mysia to Troas, Hemer comments briefly: 'Troas was not the line of least resistance, but looks like a chosen destination, involving the rejection of nearer and easier paths. Yet on arrival Paul is undecided about his next move. Was he consciously and boldly feeling his way towards the strategic route westward to Rome, or simply aiming at Τroas as the best point for finding a sea passage elsewhere, perhaps back to the East ?' Hemer wonders whether this unusual route might have been prompted by 'some indication that the provincial authorities in Asia and in Bithynia were</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND STUDIES However Paul came to Troas from beyond Mysia, as recounted in Acts xvi. 8, the nature of the routes available to him for that journey suggests strongly that his journey to Troas was not that of a bewildered man groping for a point from which new options could be considered, but that of a man already with a specific destination in mind. The geo graphical considerations make the journey to Troas most readily expli cable as an intended first stage of a journey to Macedonia (if not also beyond). This does not conflict with the fact that Paul's experience of a 'Macedonian call' came only after arrival in Troas (Acts xvi. 9). To the contrary, this understanding of the journey to Troas allows the experience at Troas better to conform to the pattern of apostolic guidance in the immediate context. In connection with the preaching tours planned first for provincial Asia and then for Bithynia (Acts xvi. 6, 7), Paul's experience of supernatural guidance did not generate his human intention but rather responded to the intention already formed. Paul's journey past Mysia to Troas, and the vision there, become then of a piece with his prior experiences: the supernatural intervention enters after the human intention. Only in this third instance, at Troas, Paul's intention is not blocked, but rather vividly confirmed, by his experience of Divine guidance. Τ ο set out from beyond Mysia for Τ roas was to set out for Macedonia. Whichever route Paul took to Troas, this, I suggest, is the implication of the nature of the routes available to him for such a journey.1 W. P. Bowers disposed to prevent or frustrate his work'. 'His first objective could then have been negative: to leave Asia as quickly and discreetly as possible for a new sphere as yet undetermined but for which Troas offered the best opening' (102, n. 66). But if one wishes by this means to explain why Paul seems to have taken minor and remote routes across Mysia to Troas, it must be recognized that if Paul could at the end of his 'discreet' traversing none the less afford to make an appearance in crowded Troas itself, there is no good reason for supposing that he needed for discretion to come there along unfrequented back roads rather than along busy and crowded regular routes; and if he came by regular roads, however discreetly, the destination of Troas as distinguished from other exit points is yet difficult to explain, except on the supposition that Paul preferred to exit towards the west, towards Macedonia. 1 That Paul, halted at the borders of Bithynia, should forgo other alternatives and deliberately head for Macedonia, either with difficulty or else circuitously, further underscores two special tendencies in the Pauline mission, the tendency as much as possible to move from province to adjacent province in a continuous advance, rather than heading off to remoter regions, and the tendency to do so in a western direction. These tendencies and their implications I have attempted to trace out in some detail in my 'Studies in Paul's Understanding of his Mission' (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, University of Cambridge, 1976), 80-117.</page></plain_text>
