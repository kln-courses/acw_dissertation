Mr Kusin's study?the first in English to concentrate on this aspect of the Czechoslovak reform movement?is short but valuable. He grew up in the dialectical atmosphere he describes. At the age of twenty-four he</page><page sequence="2">I46 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW became a lecturer at the Prague School of Economics (for four years, 1953-7); then, after years of journalism and translation he experienced the Prague Spring at close quarters. When it was over he found himself at the University of Lancaster's Comenius Centre and now holds a lectureship at Glasgow. After a lightning review of the post-war scene, the communist takeover (no nostalgic illusions here) and the obliteration of Gottwald's 'Czecho? slovak way to socialism', Mr Kusin fastens upon 1956 and the Soviet Twentieth Party Congress as the catalytic moment to which society reacted variously. The man in the street felt 'indignation, reaffirming his previous negative view of the system'; the ruling circles responded defensively; the intellectuals 'suddenly caught a glimpse of an empty space vacated by an idol, and hastened to fill it with more lasting values'. Subsequent chapters describe the search for these values?fitful at first but more and more unani? mous and self-reinforcing as the years went by and the totalitarian system proved not only brutal but inefficient and divisive. Mr Kusin turns first to the misgivings of the legal thinkers about the principles of'socialist justice' in the wake of all the trials and purges. Then he discusses the philosophical dissidents, notably Karel Kosik and his Dialectics of the Concrete, the caustic extrovert Ivan Svitak, Dubsky, Ruml, Cvekl and many others, all Marx? ists but anti-Stalinists, busily opening young minds by acquainting them with existentialist thought, with Djilas's New Class, with the overlooked early works of Marx himself?and prising away the taboo from T. G. Masaryk's humanism. In closer conflict with the Party ideologues was the Writers' Union with its memorable congresses in 1956 (when the writers with not unjustified pride labelled themselves the 'conscience of the na? tion') and again in 1967, on the very eve of the Spring, when the Party was goaded into a brief and disastrous attempt to run the Union's weekly journal on its own. Kusin devotes a section each to two favourite themes of debate during the period of growing estrangement between writers and film-makers and the political establishment?the concept of alienation, reinforced by the literary rehabilitation of Kafka (thanks largely to Pro? fessor Goldstucker's initiative at the 1963 Liblice conference in the teeth of East German indignation) and the perennial questions of Czech and Slovak national raison d'etre. This leads in turn to a review of the long struggle in institutes throughout the country, from 1956 on, to expose the official distortions of Czech history. Finally, the searchlight is turned on to the much slower progress in re-establishing serious critical work in various fields of science and technology, notably cybernetics, in sociology, in economics (Kusin does not disguise the late conversion of Professor Sik, for example, to market-socialism, and emphasises the difficulty presented to the reformers by the apparent recuperation of the economy after the 1962 low- point) and in political theory, where Zdenek Mlynaf advanced by equally gingerly steps from his orthodox beginnings to the 'pluralism' he was to expound so precariously in Dubcek's day. The chapter on foreign policy is, naturally, short. The reformers were mainly concerned to reinsure their other aims by protesting basic loyalty to the socialist camp. Only a few days before the August 1968 invasion</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 147 Radoslav Selucky was writing: 'While Czechoslovakia now seeks a Euro? pean, democratic and humanistic interpretation of Marxism ... she is not doing so in order to weaken the positions of socialism in the world, wrought through thousands of conflicts, but in order to reinforce (them).' Mr Kusin's palette is rich; the range and mixture will inevitably be criticised by any second pair of eyes. The very title suggests one limitation: the Slovak pressures upon Novotny, without which there would arguably never have been a Spring at all, are so cursorily mentioned that one sus? pects the writer regarded these as a matter of purely unintellectual nationalism and so outside his terms of reference. Again, to dismiss the role of the students in the reform movement as, by and large, a Western fallacy, seems odd. Quite apart from the brief period of student-worker fraternisation, the confidence of the radical teachers at the universities would surely have been far less if their pupils had not so eagerly endorsed their ideas. Mr Kusin's angle of vision is wide; he fondly recalls, for example, the revival of love lyrics as a respectable genre in the late 'fifties, and he ridicules the notion that the best ideas, as well as the worst, all came from the political power-centre. Yet it is not wide enough to give a completely convincing picture of public sentiment as a whole. If the licensed section of the intelligentsia 'suddenly caught a glimpse of an empty space' in 1956, there was an unlicensed and harried majority (in? cluding the whole Catholic school, the admirers of Masaryk, Pekaf, Salda, and those social democrats who had refused to be hijacked into the Com? munist Party in 1948) for whom Stalin had never been an 'idol'. The factors behind the Czechs' relative complaisance (by East European standards) toward Soviet actions and communist policies up to 1947 are properly described, but the degree of enthusiasm for the one-party system after 1948 seems, despite all qualifications, much overrated. To large sec? tions of the intelligentsia, as of the public in general, these were years of sullen silence or occasional heroic candour, and even in 1968 there were many more minds who found the democratic and the revolutionary tradi? tions basically incompatible than one would gather from the public record. The 'liberalism' of 1968, when even Svitak was at first too radical for the Literdrni noviny editors, reflected little of the opinions which had been put beyond the pale in 1948, let alone those disfranchised in 1945. Such undercurrents, it could be argued, do not belong to the history of the Spring. Not till the summer of 1968 was the whole nation behind Dub? cek, but then as a patriot rather than as a political saviour. Yet these undercurrents were obviously there and a Slovak communist like Husak, member of a thin political crust, was bound to be apprehensive of them from the start and in the end to endorse a complete closure of the flood? gates and a farewell to pluralism. The political meditations with which Mr Kusin concludes are marked by messianism ('the quest for reform is the purpose of Czech national existence') and a dogmatic assumption that the purpose of such reform is a 'full-blooded democratic socialism' while Western Europe is chidden for not having provided sufficiently inspiring models. One hears a few queries in the wings here, many in Slovak.</page><page sequence="4">148 THE SLAVONIC REVIEW The pleasure of reading this deeply felt book is sometimes marred by such brash formulations as 'Vietnam's struggle against the Americans and Saigon' and stylistic horrors like 'the endeavour to inject anthropomorphic blood into ossified cliches'. More upsetting is the failure of four noted scholars and of the editors of the Cambridge University Press to deserve the author's thanks for making his English 'less awkward than it really is'. Not Kusin, but they, should spend a Sunday in the stocks for the non? sense-making confusion of'general' with 'universal' (p. 4), two references to 'the genie of the nation' and many other embarrassments.
