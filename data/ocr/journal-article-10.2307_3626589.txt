<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of the General Description in Ostracode Taxonomy RONALD S. TAYLOR Introduction The original descriptions from a variety of ostracode publications were studied, as were the systematic descriptions in the Treatise on Inver- tebrate Paleontology, Part Q (1961) and Hartmann's authoritative work (1963) on ostracode systematics at the suprageneric levels. The construc- tion of these many descriptions, particularly the arrangement of the mor- phological characters, was analyzed and their total terminology was com- piled, grouped in appropriate morphological categories, and evaluated. A plan toward standardizing carapace descriptions was designed, one which is based upon a logical sequence of characters and which follows "conventional" sequences as nearly as possible. This standardized sequence of characters and applicable terminology is presented in outline form (beginning on p. 446) for convenient referral by the describer. Its adoption is recommended for any describer of fossil ostracodes, the experienced worker as well as the novice. Discussion Purpose of the General Description To paraphrase Mayr et al. (1953), a general description is a more or less complete statement of the morphological characters of a taxon and has as its function the recognition and identification of specimens by a subsequent worker without reference to the type. The distinctiveness of the taxon is directly proportional to the quality of its definition and as such, the preparation of a proper description is a task of the utmost importance (Mayr et al., 1953). Components of an Effective Description The effective description has as its basic ingredients: 1) clarity, 2) precision, 3) conciseness, and 4) completeness. Clarity requires correct grammar and a standardized natural sequence of morphological characters. The sequence of characters herein proposed for describing fossil ostracodes employs a logical progression of carapace inspection by the worker, i.e. from anterior to posterior, dorsal to ventral, outer surface to inner surface, proximal to distal, etc. In instances where the sequence is somewhat arbitrary, the categories are arranged in conven- tional fashion according to probable taxonomic importance, e.g. shape Transactions of the Kansas Academy of Science, Vol. 68, No. 3, 1965. Published November 10, 1965. [443]</page><page sequence="2">444 Transactions Kansas Academy of Science before type of ornamentation and hingement before the zone of concres- cence. The resulting outline rather closely follows "conventional" con- structions and may be summarized as having the following steps of inspec- tion, each step generally marked by a single shift in orientation of the specimen: 1) initial observation with no preferred orientation, 2) lateral view, 3) dorsal view, 4) end view, 5) valve relationship and contact margin, 6) surface features, 7) marginal area including hingement, and 8) muscle scars and associated features of the inner surface. Precision demands a familiarity with the structure of the organism and a thorough knowledge of the descriptive terminology, i.e. a full understanding of the exact meaning of terms. Most terms which appear in the description of an ostracode taxon are non-technical terms which can be found with precise definitions in a good dictionary such as Web- ster's New Collegiate Dictionary. For technical terms, glossaries in Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part Q (1961) and Terminology of Ostracode Carapaces (Kesling, 1951) should be consulted. In the latter publication Kesling introduced a system of subdividing the cara- pace surface into a number of labelled areas for reference purposes. This pattern of subdivision is in general use today and is recommended for standardized usage. Conciseness requires a telegraphic style, avoidance of redundancy, and selection of terms in preference to phrases. It is suggested that the two main division of the description, viz. external and internal morphol- ogy, be placed in separate paragraphs. Terms and phrases applicable to a single lower order division of the outline should be separated in the description by commas or semicolons. The transition from one outline division to another should be marked by either a period or a semicolon. The property of completeness requires inclusion of all morphological characters, both positive and negative, which are known to be useful or are potentially useful in differentiating units of the same taxon. A full descriptive treatment is necessary because in order to group fossil Ostra- coda into genera and species, a large number of morphological characters must necessarily be employed for their definition (Morkhoven, 1962). It is particularly advisable to give the fullest possible description when dealing with species of poorly known genera (Mayr et al., 1953). A check list of morphological characters facilitates this task. Advancements in Preparation of the Ostracode Description The two major refinements of recent years with regard to describing new ostracode genera and species are: 1) recognition of additional morphological data of taxonomic value and 2) coordination of the description with illustrations of higher quality and greater detail.</page><page sequence="3">Review of the General Description in Ostracode Taxonomy 445 Certain morphological characters, such as hingement and muscle scar pattern, which are now known to be of taxonomic value, were for- merly inadequately treated by authors or not mentioned at all. Due to the nature of the preservation of his material the Paleozoic worker has shown a general unconcern with regard to inner surface characters whereas his post-Paleozoic counterpart, working with better preserved forms, has found internal morphology to be of considerable systematic importance. The improved quality of illustrations is primarily attributable to superior photographic reproductions. Excellent illustrations usually con- vey more than excellent descriptions, thus a species can be described from excellent illustrations with greater fidelity than the carapace can be reconstructed from the best of descriptions. However, even at a time when the ultimate has possibly been reached in photographic reproduction, the necessity of coordinating a proper decription and excellent illustra- tions is still extant. An author should not favor one at the expense of the other. In passing it should be mentioned that other illustrative tech- niques have been developed or perfected in recent years, among them stereo pairs and drawings of models which had been constructed from serial section outlines. Original descriptions published by Geis (1932) of some Mississip- pian ostracodes demonstrate the changing standard in preparing the ostracode description. In his systematic descriptions, Geis presents excel- lent coverage of the external morphology-better than that of many con- temporary workers-but descriptions of the inner surface morphology is invariably lacking. Also the original illustrations of his types are inferior by today's standards. Sohn and Shaver found it necessary to rephoto- graph Geis' type specimens of Oliganisus and Microcheilinella for publication in the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, Part Q (1961). Unfortunately, much of the confusion concerning earlier published ostracode taxa results from inadequate illustrations. The Standardized Description The following outline of a standardized description for fossil Ostra- coda is recommended because of its efficiency when describing and its directness for comparative studies by subsequent workers. The advantages of a uniform terminology for describing morphological characters are of a similar nature. The requisites of an effective description-discussed earlier-served as guideposts for the outline. The outline is comprehen- sive, applying to all groups of fossil ostracodes, and the terminology is considered to be nearly complete.</page><page sequence="4">446 Transactions Kansas Academy of Science Where possible it is suggested that the outline be strictly adhered to. In some instances the outline can serve only as a guide; hingement and muscle scar pattern are categories where the terminology is in a state of flux and a greater amount of judgment on the part of the describer is required. It is felt that the descriptive ability of the ostracode worker- regardless of his degree of agreement with the proposed outline and its contents-will be sharpened due to his introspection of the subject. Outline of Morphological Characters and Terms Proposed for a Standardized Description of Fossil Ostracoda Key to Lists of Terms: Recommended terms applicable to the respective morphological categories are indicated by capital letters and are arranged in alphabetical order. Acceptable synonyms are indicated by small letter print. Terms which have been used synonymously but are considered unsuitable because they are less precise, unwieldy, obsolete, or anthropomorphic are printed in italics. Modifying words and phrases are listed in parentheses after the appropriate term. The synonyms are separated by semicolons. Recom- mended terms which are applicable only to Paleozoic ostracodes are indi- cated by an asterisk. When given, definitions are separated by a dash from the term defined. Terms which are in the literature but considered unnecessary or inappropriate for the particular category are listed after the designation "other terms". Annotations or remarks concerning a particular category follow its listing of terms and are enclosed in brackets. I. External morphology A. General 1. Shape-a three-dimensional form. CUNEIFORM; wedge-shaped. CYLINDRICAL DISCOID; lenticular. OVOID; egg-shaped; ovate; oval. RECTANGULAR RHOMBOHEDRAL SPHEROID; globular; globose. Other terms: Most every term descriptive of lateral outline has likewise been used to describe carapace shape. [Unless the form conforms closely in all views to a simple form, this category is best omitted from the description. A more detailed description of shape is attained by a series of outline views; see I.B. category "carapace outline".] 2. Degree of calcification HEAVILY CALCIFIED; thick-walled; thick-shelled; thick- valved; stout; robust. MODERATELY CALCIFIED; wall of moderate thickness; moderately thick-shelled; medium-shelled. THINLY CALCIFIED; thin-walled; thin-shelled; thin-valved; delicate; fragile.</page><page sequence="5">Review of the General Description in Ostracode Taxonomy 447 3. Size-physical magnitude based upon length. LARGE-length of 1.0 mm or greater. MEDIUM-SIZED-length of less than 1.0 mm, but greater than 0.6 mm. SMALL-length from 0.6 mm down to 0.2 mm. Other terms: moderately large, moderately small. [It is suggested that any form less than 0.2 mm be described as minute; greater than 2.0 mm as very large. Length of the carapace is invariably the greatest of its linear dimensions, with height usually one-half to two-thirds the length and width the least of the three dimensions. Hence length is a good approximation of comparative size.] B. Carapace outline 1. Lateral view outline-outline minus marginal features as viewed along width axis. CARDINAL ANGLES (EQUAL or UNEQUAL, OBTUSE, ACUTE, AT RIGHT ANGLES, ROUNDED, MASKED) CIRCULAR ELLIPTICAL FUSIFORM-tapering at each end. HEXAGONAL LANCEOLATE; triangular. OVATE; oval; egg-shaped; almond-shaped. PARALLEL ENDS or DORSAL AND VENTRAL MARGINS QUADRANGULAR-any plane figure having four angles; quadrate. RECTANGULAR-a right-angled parallelogram. RENIFORM RHOMBOIDAL-shaped like a rhombus (equal sides) or a rhomboid (unequal sides). SEMIELLIPTICAL SPATULATE; clavate; pear-shaped; pyriform. SWING (BACKWARD or FORWARD) TRAPEZOIDAL (WITH TAPERING TOWARD ANTERIOR, POSTERIOR, DORSUM, or VENTER) GREATEST HEIGHT (AT ANTERIOR CARDINAL ANGLE, SLIGHTLY IN FRONT OF MIDDLE, MEDIALLY, SLIGHTLY BEHIND MIDDLE, AT POSTERIOR CAR- DINAL ANGLE, etc.); preplete, amplete, postplete. GREATEST LENGTH (NEAR THE VENTRAL MARGIN, SLIGHTLY BELOW MIDDLE, MEDIALLY, NEAR DORSAL MARGIN, etc.) LONG-length is more than double the height. SHORT-height is about two-thirds the length. UNIFORM HEIGHT UNIFORM LENGTH Other terms: jagged, sigmoidal, siliquose. [Terms which may be used in combination with many of the above terms are: ELONGATE, oblong, SHORTENED, ANGULATED, ROUNDED, SUB- or IRREGULAR; e.g. elongate-ovate and sub- elliptical. The prefix "sub-" indicates an imperfect or asymmetrical state. "Irregular" should be used as a modifier if marginal features form a prominent part of the outline. If the cardinal angles are unequal, the difference is specified by phrases such as "posterior more obtuse".]</page><page sequence="6">448 Transactions Kansas Academy of Science a. Dorsal outline-dorsal part of lateral outline inclusive of any marginal features. ARCHED (BROADLY, EVENLY, FLATLY, GENTLY, SLIGHTLY, MODERATELY, NARROWLY, BOLD- LY, STRONGLY, UNIFORMLY, ASYMMETRICAL- LY, OBLIQUELY); convex. GIBBOUS; humpbacked, unbonate; angulated; angular.

ENDS SIMILAR or DISSIMILAR OBTUSELY POINTED EXTREMITY; abruptly pointed. ROSTRAL NOTCH ROUNDED (EVENLY, FLATLY, GENTLY, NAR- ROWLY, OBLIQUELY, SLIGHTLY, STRONGLY, UNIFORMLY, SEMICIRCULAR) TERMINATES IN A (RIGHT, OBTUSE, or ACUTE ANGLE or a CONCAVE or CONXEX MARGIN) WITH THE POSTEROVENTRAL or ANTEROVEN- TRAL MARGIN TRUNCATE (OBLIQUELY UPWARD, OBLIQUELY DOWNWARD, etc.); straight. UPWARD PROJECTING EXTREMITIES; upturned ex- tremities. Other terms: lengthened upward, triangular. [If the anterior and posterior outlines are dissimilar, e.g. in rounding, phrases such as "posterior more narrowly rounded", "anterior moderately rounded, but posterior attenuated" should be used to specify the difference. It is also important that the area from which the extremity projects-posteroventral, mid- posterior, posterodorsal, etc.-be specified.]</page><page sequence="7">Review of the General Description in Ostracode Taxonomy 449 d.

DORSAL SPINE FLANGE (ALONG ANTERIOR AND POSTERIOR MAR- GINS, etc). HINGE EARS HUMP KNOB LATERAL ALAE LOBE NODE RIM; marginal ridge; marginal crest. ROSTRUM SPINES (DORSALLY, etc.) SULCUS TUBERCLES [The terms listed under the dorsal, ventral, and end components of the lateral outline should be used with caution to avoid redundancy. On the other hand, description of these compon- ents lends a flexibility which promotes detailed accuracy. As a rule, any lateral marginal term prefixed by "sub-" or "irregular" requires a more detailed treatment. Marginal features which modify the lateral outline should always be specified. Kesling (1951) should be consulted concerning problems of orienta- tion.] 2. Dorsal view outline-outline as viewed along height axis. ARROW-SHAPED ELLIPTICAL END MARGINS (NARROW or WIDE, BLUNT or SHARP) HEXAGONAL LACINIATED LANCEOLATE; cuneiform; triangular. OVAL; ovate; egg-shaped. QUADRANGULAR; quadrate. RECTANGULAR SPATULATE; clavate; pear-shaped; pyriform. SIDES (FLAT, IRREGULAR, or CONVEX) TRAPEZOIDAL (WITH TAPERING TOWARD ANTERIOR or POSTERIOR) UNDULATING; waxy; sinuous. BROAD--thickness is at least one-half the length and equal to the height; rotund; wide; tumid; plump; swollen; enlarged; obese; inflated. MEDIUM WIDTH--carapace width is between one-fourth and one-half the length. NARROW---carapace width is one-fourth or less of the length and less than the height; slender; slim.</page><page sequence="8">450 Transactions Kansas Academy of Science GREATEST WIDTH (SLIGHTLY ANTERIOR, MEDIALLY, SLIGHTLY POSTERIOR, POSTERIORLY, VENTRALLY, in terms of length from the anterior or posterior) [Terms such as ELONGATE and ROUNDED may be used in combination with those above. Portions of the carapace (anterior, posterior, etc.) may be described as WIDENED or NARROWED relative to adjoining areas if there is a step-like change in contour.] 3. End view outline-outline as viewed along length axis. CORDATE ELLIPTICAL; circular. HEXAGONAL OVAL; ovate; egg-shaped. PARALLEL LATERAL SURFACES QUADRANGULAR RECTANGULAR TRAPEZOIDAL TRIANGULAR (EQUILATERAL, OBTUSE APEX, etc.) COMPRESSED-width is one-half or less of the height over most of length. DEPRESSED-width is greater than height over most of length. [Important additions to a list of modifying terms are VENTER and DORSUM. The dorsal and ventral margins should be compared. To avoid confusion it is suggested that the terms "compressed" and "depressed" be used only as just defined.] C. Valve relationship and nature of marginal contact. EQUIVALVED; equal in size. INEQUIVALED-distinctly dissimilar in size (Lv&gt;Rv or Rv&gt;Lv); unequal in size. SUBEQUAL-only slight difference in size. CAUDAL SIPHON HINGE LINE (MOST DORSAL EDGE OF THE CARAPACE, DEPRESSED IN A CHANNEL, etc.) KNURLED DORSAL MARGIN AT HINGE SOCKETS OVERLAP (DORSALLY, ALONG MID-HINGE, STRONG VEN- TRALLY, MID-VENTRALLY, AT ANTERIOR END OF HINGE, etc.) OVERREACH (DORSALLY or VENTRALLY) RESUPINATE CONTACT (VENTRAL or DORSAL) ROSTRAL INCISURE VALVES DIFFERENTLY CONSTRUCTED VENTRICULUS-any modification of the ventral free edge which enables the valves to remain in contact ventrally while agape. Other terms: contact tight or loose, entire margin in contact, endoven- ticular contact, exoventricular contact.

RUGOSE; wrinkled. SMOOTH; polished. SPINOSE (BLUNT, SHORT, LONG, HIRSUTE, etc.); spin- iferous. STRIATE TUBERCULATE; shagreen. VARIABLE; irregular. [A designation of faint, fine, heavy, delicate, or weak ornamentation is usually too general for taxonomic purposes. However many tex- tural types have a size range which permits prefacing by terms such as faint or coarse. In some instances, combinations of terms are useful, e.g. granuloreticulate. The terms papillate and pustulose both describe surfaces covered with small protuberances, but they differ in that a pustule has a pore in the middle. Trends of ornamentation that may be apparent are as follows: transverse, longitudinal, concentric, parallel to margins of shell.] 2. Subsidiary ornament and textural details. CARINA *CHANNEL CREST; crest-like rib. DORSAL DENTICLES DORSAL PLICA DORSAL SPINE-a solid, more or less prominent pointed project on dorsal margin. FISSURE-narrow steep-sided groove.

[Ornamentation is here defined as the total of all the local elevations and depressions that are not reflected on the inner surface. Eleva- tions and depressions which are reflected on the inner surface are listed under the next category "structural characters". General textural terms of the previous category are also applicable to detailed ornament description althuogh not repeated in the above list. One should be mindful that ornament may be affected by the mode of preservation or by individual variations (Kesling, 1954); for these reasons the range or ornament variation should be pursued.]</page><page sequence="10">452 Transactions Kansas Academy of Science 3.
