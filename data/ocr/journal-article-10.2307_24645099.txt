<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS: PERVASIVE CRUELTY AS INDICATED AND PROPAGATED IN THE BELLUM CATILINAE OF SALLUST AND INTERRELATING NARRATIVE. I Theodore F. Foss Abstract The legacy of Rome endures in many ways, and ancient ideas concerning animals permeate human thought still today. This paper explores how beinghood was de nied to animals in antiquity: on a linguistic level, through metaphor derived from Graeco-Roman literary tradition - notably evident in Semonides, Homer, and Ovid; on a philosophical level, through ideas such as Aristotle's Scala naturae, and Plato's dichotomy of the soul, and finally, on an impressionistic level, through vi sual representations of animals as live entertainment and as commodities. Nega tive and hostile ideas about animals (derived from, and at interplay with, metaphor, philosophy, and manipulated impressions) became deeply embedded in popular narrative and culture in antiquity. The research here will especially come to bear in Part 2 of this study: an examination of Sallust's Bellum Catilinae. ι. Introduction 1.1. Modern World, Ancient Worldview: Oppressive Language and the Scala naturae If we were to accept George Orwell's dictum, "[a]ll propaganda is lies, even when one is telling the truth" (411), then much narrative would function as de facto propaganda, espousing and upholding a dominant worldview only imagined to be true. Through propagandistic language, overwhelm ingly bad arguments are often received and dearly embraced by those who stand to profit from accepting them. In this way, oppressive ideologies up hold a desirable way of life for one group, while impugning the most vul nerable with prejudicial lies. My claim hardly needs any illustration: we are all familiar with the Third Reich, or the legacy of Columbus, and the cor responding justifications for atrocities. In White Over Black, American historian Winthrop Jordan explains that racist notions of inferiority stem from belief in a natural order of being1 - 1 See Chapter 12 of Jordan, 'The Negro Bound by the Chain of Being' (482-511). Cited in Dunayer, Animal Equality, 161, and 237 n. 11.</page><page sequence="2">96 THEODORE F. FOSS namely, the Scala naturae, or Great Chain - an idea with roots in Aristotelian philosophy. Modern physics and evolutionary theories have proven many ancient understandings of the universe untrue, including the Great Chain (Rachels 112-15); yet in order to sustain common prejudices, the idea of natural hierarchy has persisted well past its expiration date.1 In fact, we can think of all prejudices as belonging to a single manifold discourse, always based on ancient hierarchal notions. While these different forms of discrimination employ mutually reinforcing oppressive language, it is speciesist language that forms the bedrock on which all others rest: oppres sors are able to debase certain humans simply by comparing them to other animals (Dunayer, Equality 167). Such verbal assault saw Jews, indigenous peoples of the Americas, and indigenous peoples of Africa thoroughly de graded as "subhuman" and "bestial", and helped lead the way for their sub sequent displacements, enslavements, massacres, and genocides. Countering prejudices such as racism, sexism, classism, and speciesism, involves uncovering the lies and half-truths most deeply embedded in lan guage, and recognizing how and where they operate to oppress and exploit.2 As nonhuman animals3 are the default means by which to degrade, hostili ty towards them is so pervasive as to go undetected, unless effort is applied. The general linguistic assertion is that animals are inferior and therefore nat urally subjugated (Stibbe 50), while humans are superior and therefore en titled to subjugate (Dunayer, 'Speciesist Roots' 11). This sentiment sprang 1 Regarding the Great Chain as thrust upon African peoples to promote their oppres sion, Jordan notes, "(e)ven in this radically changed atmosphere [of Darwinian evolution] remnants of the old concept of hierarchy were still lying about, for no exploded idea dissi pates completely. The very phraseology of Darwinism - 'higher' and 'lower' forms and so forth - testified to the residual strength of the hierarchal principal, and there were many men, especially in the early years of the twentieth century, very much disposed to apply it to mankind" (510). We should recognize that outmoded notions of hierarchy were just as unfounded between humans and other animals as they were between any groups of hu mans. Incidentally, although Darwin had used the terms himself, he realized they were throwbacks to invalidated hierarchical thinking, and at some point in his own copy of Ves tiges, scribbled to himself "never use the words higher and lower" (Nash 42). 2 That discrimination embeds itself (or is actively embedded) in language is a basic tenet of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), a method based on the proposition that language is important in power relationships. George Orwell informally engaged in CDA in 1984, Ani mal Farm, and his various essays. A seminal work of CDA is Language and Power, by Norman Fairclough (1989). Other leading academics in the field include Roger Fowler, Bob Hodge, Gunther Kress, Teun A. van Dijk, and Ruth Wodak. For CDA as applied to the study of non human/human relationships, see especially Joan Dunayer and Arran Stibbe (both of whose ideas are prominent in the present paper). For an excellent introduction to CDA, please see van Dijk, Critical Discourse 352-371. 3 I will use the term "nonhuman animals" as well as the unadjoined "nonhumans" and "animals" interchangeably when referring to nonhuman sentient beings.</page><page sequence="3">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS 97 from ancient philosophy, and was no less affirmed in Republican Rome than it is today. In looking to the Romans, we will recognize foundations of existing prejudices in Western culture, and therefore identify an important historical influence on current wide scale misuses, abuses, displacements, enslavements, massacres, extinctions, and genocides1 of animals.2 ι. 2. Nonhuman Animals in Sallustian Historiography In the first two lines of Bellum Catilinae (BC), Sallust opens Rome's earliest extant and complete work of historiography3 with striking hostility towards 1 "Genocide" may seem a persuasive definition for species extirpations (or extinctions) due to the activities of humans, but on no reasonable grounds can we deny the term as ap plied, for example, to any great apes (human or nonhuman). Merriam-Webster (11th ed., 2004) defines genocide as "the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group", and certainly human relations to various social groupings of cultural non humans fit this description. 2 Regarding the current scale of animal exploitation, Steiner notes, "[i]n 1994, in North America alone, seven billion broiler chickens were slaughtered for human consumption [ital ics are Steiner's]; in the United States, one hundred thousand cattle are slaughtered daily" (38). Current extinction rates of animal species are 100 to 1,000 times higher than those found in the fossil record (MEA 3). This rate of extinction is due to human activities, and largely a cause of direct animal exploitation: the wildlife trade in all its various forms (pet trade, "pelt" trade, medicine, zoos, etc.), and intensive animal farming and overgrazing. As human use of ani mals generally fulfills wants rather than (and often very much at the expense of) needs, I use the word "exploitation" in its most negative sense (i.e., to use meanly and unfairly for rela tively trivial gain, rather than necessity). For example (if we evaluate human eating habits in light of allotable land, water and energy, as well as biological and chemical pollution), that it requires 20 kilograms of vegetable matter to produce 1 kilogram of beef makes it an under statement to say the typical Western diet (now exported around the world) is extravagant (Brennan 159). Currently, twenty-six percent of Earth's total land surface is given over to graz ing, and thirty-three percent of arable land to feedcrop production; of all agricultural land, seventy percent is devoted to "livestock" (Steinfeld 272,278). The environmental damage due to habitat change, climate change ("livestock" directly contributes more greenhouse gases than the global transportation sector) is catastrophic (please see Steinfeld and the full 2006 UN report, Livestock's Long Shadow). As to the common institutionalized conditions of cruel ty that individual animals must face as a result of human trivial wants (for copious amounts of cheap meat and dairy, for entertainment, "sport", fashion, vanity, etc.), they are horrifical ly abused in ways far too numerous (and in myriad new ways) to account for in the present document. For initial investigation, I direct the reader to various reputable animal protection groups, such as Humane Society International (HSI), World Society for the Protection of An imals (WSPA), Animal Legal Defence Fund (ALDF), International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW), Great Ape Project (GAP), Defenders of Wildlife, and Farm Sanctuary. In addition, see the studies of Andrew Linzey, Marjorie Spiegel, Linda Kalof, Stephen M. Wise, Jim Ma son, Tom Regan, and Peter Singer. For statistical information only, I direct the reader to the IUCN, the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, and the NOAA Fisheries Service. 3 Sallust's BC and Jugurtha, as well as the Caesarian commentarti are the first extant his toriographical monographs of Roman antiquity preserved in their entirety (Kraus-Wood man 10). Of Sallust's works, scholars generally hold that BC came first (Ramsey 6).</page><page sequence="4">98 THEODORE F. FOSS animals, introducing to the reader a bleak discourse on the relationship of flawed humans to supposedly inferior "beasts". Sallust sustains this dis course in forceful tone throughout the work, making his claims through the prism of a Roman Stoic worldview, with stress on Aristotelian order, Platonic divisions, and Stoic aristocratic "manliness", or virtus. Although apparent from the outset he is writing in no small way about animals, re markably I have not found a modern treatment of such for BC (a testament to current speciesist attitudes); therefore, I endeavour to undertake one here. My concern will be with what animal representations mean for ani mals themselves, rather than for the humans they symbolize. BC is ostensi bly a treatise on human morality and an historical account of a political af fair, but contains text and a great deal of subtext revealing powerful ideas about the nature of nonhumans. As an influential artefact professing moral truth, BC was authoritative in its own time and for centuries afterwards:1 it not only reflected culture, but must have played a role in affecting culture; therefore, BC is important to read not only for things like historicity, style, rhetoric, and literary narra tive, but also for ideological assumptions that inform social narrative. Through moral reflection, philosophical assertion, inherently hostile lan guage, and an emphasis of animals as different and inferior, the Bellum Catilinae of Sallust provides a rich account of "animality" (in humans and nonhumans) that both reflects and reinforces negative attitudes towards animals; Sallust's implicit account emerges largely through explicit dis course on the nature of virtus. 2. Embedded Hostility 2. ι. Analytical Approach and Supporting Works As a framework for interpretation I will apply Critical Discourse Analysis to BC and to supporting ancient works, notably those of Cicero and Ovid, in order to outline how textual constructions of animals interact with broad social narrative (macro-narrative vis-à-vis micro-narratives). I will show how animals are reflected in text (what is betrayed in their representations about them in the real world), especially concerning violence inflicted on 1 Syme notes, "The whole range of literature in late antiquity acknowledges his [Sal lust's] spell, from Ammianus to the Historia Augusta, from Church fathers to the lowly tribe of grammarians and scholiasts" (301). According to Robert Stein, "[l]ate Antique Classicism had elevated Sallust's historical writings to a position little short of veneration: Quintilian had compared him to Thucydides, Martial had named him 'first among historians' "«.Au gustine of Hippo regarded Sallust "the historian of greatest veracity" (nobilitate veritatis historicus, De civ. Dei 1,5).</page><page sequence="5">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS 99 them, then I will address the power of those reflections in furthering vio lence towards them: how textual animals reinforce and even form human attitudes towards real animals. Discrimination in narrative occurs on at least three interrelated levels: the level of the individual word or phrase, the level of the conceptual common metaphor,1 and the level of the institution.2 Accordingly, I will address words or phrases in their specific textual contexts, I will address metaphors where they convey ideological beliefs concerning animals, and I will address institutional power in the form of authoritative writers, their written docu ments, and genres of writing. 2.2. Narrative - Philosophical Accounting - Implicit Conclusions Despite that Roman historical writing was non-philosophical (as in non-ar gumentative), it was not confined to chronological accounting or the telling of factual events, but also made cultural and moral assertions, and was held as a repository of philosophical truths; for this reason, we must address the philosophical precepts asserted by Sallust and other writers. However, I will relegate such scrutiny only to what is necessary for a discussion of narra tive. Roman historians, poets, and playwrights occupied a central role in the cultural milieu: they disseminated ideas that drove societal attitudes. In deal ing with non-argumentative narrative, I hope to draw attention to this facet of social influence recognized but having ramifications not discussed by Daniel Dombrowski, Richard Sorabji, Gary Steiner, Stephen Newmyer, and others who have taken an historical approach grounded in philosophy in at tempting to uncover the ancient roots of animal oppression.3 Narrative propagates ideas without argument: no evidence required, just simple assertion. One of the ways Sallust presents assertions is through ideology - persisting with one side of an argument (usually the side that suits one's preference or advantage) no matter how contrary the evidence. For example, Sallust forwards the Platonic notion that humans liberate their souls (mind and reason) by taming their "bestial" elements (appetite and 1 A common (or conventional) metaphor is a pervasive metaphorical phrase or concep tion that determines perception (for example "the man is a beast", whereby it is understood the man is oafish or violent - the common knowledge of what the metaphor conveys, rather than evidence about beasts, creates human understanding of what is a beast) (Goatly 16; Harvey 163). 2 Drawing on the scholarship of Pierre Bourdieu, Judith Butler stresses that recognizing hate speech involves addressing the institutional force where words come from (156). In the case of Sallust, the institutional force is official historical writing. 3 Incidently, Sorabji proposes that attention to non-philosophical literature would en rich his study of attitudes towards animals in philosophical texts (3).</page><page sequence="6">100 THEODORE F. FOSS body) (Resp. 591b) (Newmyer, 'Philosophy' 159). While this contention is no doubt meant to declare what it means to be a good human, and likely not meant to say anything about other animals, it nevertheless, by describing ideal behaviour as something apart from all other sentient life, functions to degrade animals in propping up humans. The assertion ignores that animals have several obvious characteristics that should define them besides body and appetite. The division of a wholly appetitive animal soul, and a higher, divine, and uniquely human rational soul is of course false. Plato himself had contradictory views on animals: sometimes denying, other times grant ing them reason. In Laws, generally considered his final work,1 he goes so far as to grant them nous (νους) (the rational and immortal part of the soul), which he declares the salvation of every animal (96id), not just human (Steiner 55-6). Sallust, however, does not choose Plato's possible reconsider ation, or his few more generous views, instead taking a hard-line position of the sharp distinction between mind and body, human and animal. While Sallust provides an excellent example of ideological animal op pression in ancient literary narrative, his assertions are by no means unique. We see through narratives generally the unresolved arguments of certain philosophers become implicit conclusions in the culture at large. For example, Aristotle argued the animal soul was irrational, Theophras tus argued it was rational, and Plato, as noted, wavered in his position (Newmyer, 'Philosopy' 158-163), but the common assertion among the later Roman narrators who drew from these philosophers is that of animal irra tionality. Certain Aristotelian and Platonic views were favoured by the Hel lenistic philosophical school of the Stoics, and Stoicism appealed strongly to the Romans because in many ways it articulated the mos maiorum,2 with its emphasis on duty, public service, and virtue. Aristotle's belief that animals lacked reason led the Stoics to regard them as undeserving of human kinship or moral consideration.3 Chrysippus, the highly influential early Greek Sto ic, went so far as to claim oxen and horses existed solely for hard labour, and pigs for no other reason but to be killed and eaten by humans, with souls sup plied merely for flavour.4 Cicero relates the Stoic perspective (De fin. 3, 67): Et quo modo hominum inter homines iuris esse vincula putant, sic homini nihil iuris esse cum bestiis. praeclare enim Chrysippus, cetera nata esse hominum causa 1 Stalley 2-4 2 Mos maiorum: "custom of the ancestors", an important Roman ideal of adhering to a venerable tradition. 3 For Stoic viewpoints and development on animals, see Sorabji 7-28, Steiner 77-92, and Newmyer, 'Philosophy' 158-163. 4 According to Porphyry, De abst. 3,20,1 (drawing on Plutarch).

And in the same manner that they reckon there are bonds of justice between hu mans, so for humans there is nothing of justice with the beasts. Chrysippus was very clear indeed that all other things are born for the sake of humans and gods, while humans, on the other hand, were born for their own community and socie ty, so that humans may use beasts to their own advantage, without injustice.1 As animals exist completely outside the margins of justice (homini nihil iuris esse cum bestiis) - with no stipulations as to how they may be used - humans have moral carte blanche to treat them indifferently; accordingly, the ques tion of animal suffering becomes insignificant (Newmyer, 'Philosophy' 165). Cato, Cicero, Sallust, Livy and many other influential non-philosophers spread this exclusionist theory, with devastating results. Certain ideas they asserted, consistently and implicitly,2 worked on the collective imagination and slipped ever deeper into human consciousness, firmly cementing com monplaces of thought - regardless of any professed philosophical school to which one might belong.3 Sallust, for instance, provided a strong contribu tion to the reinforcement of traditional Roman values, borrowing in austere moral tone (and high rhetorical flourish) from none other than Cato the Younger (peifectissimus Stoicus, according to Cicero)4 (Stem 39-40); however, he never mentions Stoicism in any of his writings, nor does he mention Ar istotle, Plato, Chrysippus, or Zeno (the founder of Stoicism).5 He does not 1 This is basic Aristotelian philosophy: everything was assumed to have a purpose, and all ammalia a post. 'Aristotelian physics [and biology] appealed to all sorts of evaluative con cepts in explaining the world. Gravitational attraction - or, what we would call gravitation al attraction - was explained, for example, in terms of 'objects seeking their proper places'" (Rachels 113). Among many influential ideas, Aristotle claimed that nature created slaves for masters, and other animals for humans (Wise 9). 2 Ideology is more effectively dispensed when it appears implicitly (Stibbe 48; Fair clough 84). 3 Of course, to what extent writers created or sparked new ideas, as opposed to fostered ideas already prevalent, is difficult to know. 4 ... omnesfere Stoici prudentissumi in disserendo sint et id artefaciant sintque architetti paene verborum, idem traducti a disputando ad dicendum inopes reperiantur. unum expicio Catonem, in quo perfettissimo Stoico summam eloquentiam non desiderem, "... the Stoics are very practiced in discussion and they conduct it with skill and are almost architects of words. Yet when trans ferred from debate to oratory, the very same men are found wanting. For Cato alone do I make an exception, in whom, although a most perfect Stoic, I do not sense the lack of the highest eloquence" (Cic. Brut. 118). 5 Ronald Syme asserts Sallust was not a Stoic, and suggests he might have been an Epi curean (Syme 270-271). However, with perhaps one exception (Sallust's disdain for hunting and farming) (BC 4,1), BC is not at odds with a Stoic worldview, and certainly not regarding animals. No matter, neither Stoics nor Epicureans included animals in their circle of justice</page><page sequence="8">102 THEODORE F. FOSS put across any of their differing or self-contradictory views, nor suggest even a possibility of other philosophical stances on animals (and there were many).1 In fact, Sallust never really mentions animals (not once for their own sakes) - he simply asserts implicitly hostile ideas about them taken from a prevalent ideological position, in turn taken from cherry-picked philosophical ideas suitable to a society where human members benefited by exerting horrible oppression on other sentient beings.2 3. Real Animals in Ancient Rome 3.1. Spectacles and Exterminations To help the reader appreciate my contention that oppression of animals in text is important, I present here a brief survey of Roman animal exploita tion. After considering this paper as a whole, this survey should give some substantiation to the claim that attitudes in text affect treatment of animals in the real world. As visual representations, animals in the arena, taken from the wild, served as powerful tools of propaganda in upholding militarism (especially during the Pax Romana, but also during the Late Republic, when the might of Rome needed to be promulgated) (Shelton 120-121). The use of animals as spectacles (in artificial settings, and manipulated to act as determined by humans) meant they were seen in ways their captors chose to represent them. Far from accurate portrayals of true wildness, or the uncivilized (as is commonly asserted), the arena provided images of animals immersed in or moral responsibility; both schools believed the capacity to reason, which was denied an imals by Aristotle, was essential for moral consideration (Sorabji 8-12). Mazzolarli sees Sal lust's focus on the dualism between matter and spirit to be "possibly of Pythagorean origin" (62-63), a philosophy that happens to be much kinder to animals - but BC contains not a hint of Pythagorean compassion. Whatever claims are made by scholars about the philosophi cal stance of Sallust, we can see in BC that he was in many ways a conventional Roman his torian (if we set his unique stylistic proficiency aside [Syme 240]). This is evident in his im plicit view of animals, in his lamentation of the greed and luxury of Roman citizens, and other topoi (Morford 47-50). Certainly Sallust provided a strong contribution to the rein forcement of traditional aristocratic Roman, and therefore Stoic, moral values. Ultimately it is not relevant to my argument which school(s) of philosophy Sallust may or may not have belonged, but what various individual philosophical ideas he perpetuated. 1 See Steiner, on Pythagoras and Empedocles (45-52), and on Plutarch (93-103); see Newmyer, 'Philosophy' (163) on Theophrastus. 2 Ideological positions do not need to be dialectically sound or cogent; they only need be relevant to the interests of the group (van Dijk, Ideology 72). Animals served the Romans in very many ways, and there were economic and military incentives for misuse and abuse. The Romans considered themselves a just society; therefore, they sought justification (how ever tenuous) for their cruelty.</page><page sequence="9">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS 103 contexts of battle, torture, and execution - the appropriation of nature red in tooth and claw to the abandonment of all else. Ultimately, this was a pres entation of Roman humanity projected onto nonhumans.1 In BC, we will see this same contextualization when Sallust metaphorically appropriates animals to reflect "savage" violence in humans. The most attested accounts of ancient cruelty to animals indeed sur round the exploitation of "wild beasts" for use as entertainment. According to public records, regular massacres of animals provided amusement to the Romans for over 450 years (185 BCE-281 CE) (Kalof 27). Free ("wild") ani mals were rounded up for venationes2 and arena shows that took place in the provinces as well as the city-centre of Rome. On the savannas of Africa, predators would be lured into pits and nets by official Roman employees called magistri, who used kids, lambs, or puppies as bait (tied in such ways as to cause them to emit painful howls); distressed animals would be snared attempting to rescue their stolen offspring (Toynbee 72); birds were caught on branches smeared with birdlime; and other animals would be trapped with foot nooses, or iron spikes covered in twigs (Hughes 100-105). Once captured, many underwent transport in the same claustrophobic boxes in which they were trapped. Such was the fate of lions, for instance, who up on arrival at their destinations, with much weight and strength lost, typi cally trembled in the backs of their boxes, petrified at the open sand and en compassing (often thunderous) crowds. The magistri drove out the ragged survivors with burning straw and hot irons, whereby the only means of refuge slammed shut behind them, and so-called "hunters" (venatores) cut down the divested animals. Alternatively, the half-starved, beaten, harassed and prodded victims would be forced to attack each other, or (often re strained) humans, in acts of extreme mutilation and horror.3 In such man ner, these reluctant participants were presented as bloodthirsty beasts. Oc casionally, those who could not be coerced were simply butchered at the doors of their cages for refusing to leave: their unforeseen voyages ending to the sound of human hands clapping. This scenario played out for cen 1 In using the term "humanity"(denoting qualities apparent in human societies) rather than "brutality" (denoting qualities alleged to be apparent in other animals), I have at tempted to assert what is true rather than what is opposite of the Romans, thereby avoid ing a typical example of systemic doublespeak. The orchestrated violence of the arena was human; to use language that denotes other animals would be to blame the victim. 2 Well before the inauguration of big-city arena massacres, rural venationes ("hunts" in human-created settings) provided the Romans with sadistic entertainment - whereby all re al or imagined, immediate or potential, animal threats to crops and "livestock" were indis criminately, painfully, and prolongedly killed in public spectacles and festivals (Kalof 27). 3 See Auguet (46-80); and Futrell (84-119), which contains an abundant collection of an cient sources describing the bloodbaths of the games.</page><page sequence="10">104 THEODORE F. FOSS turies across the Mediterranean. The massive scale of the killings over time cannot be disputed, as indicated by the well-known literary records of the games themselves,1 as well as dramatic indirect evidence demonstrating immense declines of animals from areas of previous abundance (Auguet 107). Donald Hughes notes the archaeological evidence to back up the writ ten record, and gives an account of the domino-like massacres from region to region (105). Across vast areas of their purview, Romans snuffed out sen tient life: they drove to extinction the zebras, rhinoceri, and elephants of North Africa, the lions of Thessaly, the hippopotami and crocodiles of the lower Nile, and the tigers of Armenia and Hyrcania (in Northern Iran) (Hughes 106). Pending their executions in arenas, some animals were watched by Ro mans in holding cells (vivaria) for public exhibition (Kalof 36). Much like to day, there were also animals stripped of all freedom and dignity, suffering full-time boredom, frustration, loneliness and alienation in public zoos, for the trivial gratification and professed educational purposes of any humans who would pay admission (including school children on field trips) (Kalof 36-37). Animals were also kept in aviaries, fishponds, small parks, and private menageries, where they would be gawked at or killed in confined spaces (shooting with arrows at close range during feeding time was apparently a popular pastime)2 (Shelton 120). One anecdote of Suetonius tells of Domit ian s propensity for shooting animals twice in the skull, in a manner so as to look as if they had horns (Kalof 25). Numerous other forms of entertainment involved acute suffering and death for animals, usually as public spectacle. Bulls had their necks deliber ately broken by men on horseback, who would race up beside them and vi olently wrench their horns; restrained animals (including humans) were tor mented and/or ripped apart after being set upon by dogs; specially-bred horses met with horrific crash injuries and death in chariot races;3 and ele phants were tamed, trained, and killed in scenes of battle, as well as less vi 1 Augustus (Res gest. 22) apparently had thirty five hundred African animals killed, in twenty six "hunts" (venationes) for public entertainment; and Dio Cassius (68,15) reports that Trajan, upon return from a successful campaign, gave shows for one hundred and twenty three days, during which time he had eleven thousand animals slain. Other notable passages pointing to the excessive killings of animals in rings include Calpurnius, Eel. 7, 24 and Dio Cassius 73,18-21 (Futrell 35, 89,116). 2 See Varrò, De re rust. 3,13,1-3. 3 Chariot accidents were called "shipwrecks" (naufragia); these accidents were likely not unusual, considering the rough techniques of the charioteers, and the high speeds of massed horses on crowded tracks (Futrell 191). From modern accounts of track racing, we know Roman horses would have undergone great stress in training as well as in shows. To get something of an idea for its violence, we can compare Roman chariot racing to chuck wagon racing today, where horses are very often killed due to crash injuries or cardiac ar rest (according to HSI).</page><page sequence="11">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS 105 olently debased as actors compelled to dance and perform in comedic are na shows1 (Toynbee 48-49; Kalof 33). Elephants were also occasionally used by the Romans for real battles (Toynbee 32-38). According to Hughes, "[collection of animals for the games was not the only cause for disappearance... [a jmong the causes of the extinction of the North African form of the elephant, for example, were the use of the animal in warfare and, more important, the ivory trade" (106). Roman use and abuse of elephants resulted in great personal suffering for the animals; both those directly tortured and killed, as well as their relations remaining behind. These sensitive mammals must have grieved profoundly as the Romans fractured their close-knit families, tore apart their commu nities,2 and decimated their entire populations. The Roman army combed the land everywhere it traveled, killing ani mals for provisions of flesh and, according to Xenophon, for "excellent training in war" (Hughes 97). Animals were also systematically stamped out as dangers and pests (through government military force, as well as by indi vidual citizens): wolves, jackals, foxes, and bears were unrelentingly slaugh tered to make way for farmland and protect herds; herbivores competing for crops were also killed in vast numbers (Hughes 98). 3.2. Domesticated Animals It cannot be disputed that the Romans bettered today's factory farmers in attention to animal welfare (Clutton-Brock 88), and concern for ancient do mesticated animals is well attested. However, though farmers had not sunk to modern levels of calculated cruelty in maximizing output and profit, we should not mistake Roman animal welfare to have been for the sake of animals themselves, or imagine that it ever approached decent standards. Varrò, Cato, Columella, and Pliny (our main ancient sources for animal husbandry around the time of the Late Republic) make it clear that the well being of animals on farms was important only so far as it pertained to the bottom line; Varrò makes this explicit in De re rust. 5, 5-6: Cum opus sunt, ex hoc aviario ut sumantur idoneae, excludantur in minusculum aviarium, quod est coniunctum cum maiore ostio, lumine illustriore, quod seclu sorium appellant. Ibi cum eum numerum habet exclusum, quem sumere vult, omnes occidit. Hoc ideo in secluso clam, ne reliqui, si videant, despondeant ani mum atque alieno tempore venditoris moriantur. When the time has come to take from this aviary those birds deemed suitable for selling, they should be shut into a smaller area called the Seclusorium, which has a 1 Pliny, Nat. hist. 8, 2, 2 2 For excellent field observations of a Kenyan elephant society, see Moss 119-144.</page><page sequence="12">io 6 THEODORE F. FOSS bright lamp, and is connected with the larger aviary by a doorway. When the farmer has the number he wishes to take locked out from the others, he kills them all. This is done accordingly in seclusion and without the knowledge (of the other ducks), lest the others see the mortal remains, and their spirits give up; in which case they might die at an inopportune time for the seller. Here we get some insight into the familial/societal bond of ducks: if they would become despondent from watching their relations killed, we can as sume they would have suffered also from involuntary or prolonged separa tion. However, there is some concern here for welfare (if only for the sake of the seller). By contrast, whenever cruelty suited financial gain, expedien cy, or even culinary preference, cruelty was recommended. In order to pro vide the most succulent flesh to buyers, thereby increasing profit, Varrò (De re rust. 3,7,9) instructs breaking the legs of pre-fledgling pigeons so they can not exercise, and "cramming" them with a diet of nutrient empty white bread (like common practices for young animals today, a diet deliberately deficient in order to ensure pale flesh): Qui solent saginare pullos columbinos, quo pluris vendant, secludunt eos, cum iam piuma sunt tecti. Deinde manducato candido farciunt pane: hieme hoc bis, aestate ter, mane meridie vesperi; hieme demunt cibum medium. Qui iam pinnas incipi unt habere, relincunt in nido inlisis cruribus et matribus, uberius ut cibo uti possint, obiciunt. Eo enim totum diem se et pullos pascunt. Qui ita educantur, celerius pin guiores fiunt quam alii, et candidae fiunt parentes eorum. Romae, si sunt formosi, bono colore, integri, boni seminis, paria singula volgo veneunt ducenis nummis nec non eximia singulis milibus nummum. Those who practice the fattening of young pigeons, for the purpose of fetching a higher selling price, shut them in seclusion as soon as they are covered with down. Then they cram the birds with chewed-up white bread: twice per day in winter and three times in summer - morning, noon, and night; in winter they omit the noon feeding. By the time any birds begin to have feathers, they are left to their mothers in the nest, with their legs crushed, so that they can eat copious amounts of food. Consequently, they indeed gorge themselves all day long. Birds that are raised in this manner fatten more quickly than others do, and their parents become white. At Rome, if the birds are attractive, of good colour, sound, and of good breed, sin gle pairs usually sell for two hundred sesterces, but unusually good ones sometimes sell for a thousand sesterces. Varrò (De re rust. 3,9,18)1 instructs that hens for cramming should have their feathers pulled out, and undergo severe confinement in order to speed up the process of getting them to market (thereby increasing profit): 1 Cf. Cato, De agri cult. 89-90.</page><page sequence="13">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS 107 Eas includunt in locum tepidum et angustum et tenebricosum, quod motus earum et lux pinguitudinis vindicta... ex iis evulsis ex alis pinnis et e Cauda farciunt tu rundis hordeaceis partim admixtis farina lolleacia aut semine lini ex aqua dulci... dato cibo, quom perpurgarunt caput, nequos habeat pedes, rursus eas concludunt.

These [hens] are shut into a warm, narrow, darkened place, because movement and light free them from the slavery of fat... the hens feathers are pulled from wings and tail, and they are fattened on pellets of barley-meal, sometimes mixed with flour, or with flax seed soaked in fresh water... when they have eaten, and their heads have been cleaned to prevent lice, they are again locked up. This is continued as long as 25 days, at which point they finally become fat. Some breeders fatten them also on wheat bread softened in water mixed with a sound, fragrant wine, which results in making them fat and tender within 20 days... the same method is followed in cramming wood-pigeons to make them fat. In addition to the cruelty of being deprived any normal life experience (sun light, fresh air, flight and movement), we know from observing the effects of force-feeding ducks today (for foie gras) that Varro's birds would have un dergone painful bruising, lacerations, sores, and internal ruptures.1 Pliny (Nat. hist. 8, 77, 207-209)2 instructs that pigs can be fattened in less than sixty days, if starved and tortured for three before their fattening process begins. He callously instructs in a violent procedure of castration to speed up fattening, force-feeding for distension of the liver (as also in geese), and how to begin marinating for flavour while the animal is still alive: 1 See HSI &lt;http://www.hsi.org/issues/force_fed_animals/&gt;: accessed 2012-02-15. 2 In line 208 of the same passage (between 207 and 209 above), Pliny, in a self-serving, question-begging, and ultimately misotheric (hateful towards animals) manner, makes the Chryssipian statement that pigs are the most brutish (i.e./'lowest") of all animals, while at the very same time giving examples of their intelligence and civility: animalium hoc maxime brutum animamque ei pro sale datam non inlepide existimabatur. compertum agnitam vocem suarii furto abactis, mersoque navigio inclinatione lateris unius remeasse. quin et duces in urbe forum nun dinarium domosque petere discunt, et fen sapiunt vestigia palude confondere, urina fugam levare, "The swine is by far the most brutish of all the animals, and it has been said, and not un aptly, that life has been given them in place of salt. And yet it has been known that these an imals, when carried away by thieves, have recognized the voice of their keeper; and when a boat has been under water through the inclination of one of its sides, they have had the sense to go over to the other side. The leader of the herd will even learn to go to the mar ket, and to different houses in the city. In the wild too, they have the sense to pass their urine in marshy places, that they may erase all traces of themselves, and so lighten themselves for flight" (Nat. hist. 8,77, 208).</page><page sequence="14">ιο8 THEODORE F.

M. Apicius made the discovery that we may employ the same method to (expanding) the sow's liver as that of the goose; it consists in cramming her with dried figs until she is fat, at which point she is drenched with honeyed wine, and immediately killed. According to Varrò (De re rust. 2, 4,11), standard practice in farming is to re move piglets from their mother during their second month if she has eight or more, so that the remainder of her offspring will grow fat on a higher quantity of milk and presumably fetch a higher price. Varrò attributes Cato with speaking admiringly of the Insubrians in Italy for the cruelty they in flict on pigs in fattening them: ... adeo pinguitudine crescere solet, ut se ipsa stans sustinere non possit neque progredì usquam. Itaque eas siquis quo traicere volt, in plaustrum imponit. ... in spring the sow grows so fat that she cannot stand on her own feet, and cannot take a step; and so when one is to be taken anywhere she must be placed in a wagon. The upkeep of an animal's health may be disregarded for reasons besides succulence; Varrò (De re rust. 2, 5, 11) states that maintaining the health of cattle need not always be a concern: ...qui Manili actiones secuntur lanii, qui ad cultrum bovem emunt; qui ad altaria, hostiae sanitatem non solent stipulali ... in buying for slaughter, those who buy for sacrifice do not usually demand a guarantee of soundness in the victim. Jo-Ann Shelton notes that while the ideal victima for sacrifice would be young and "unblemished", in good health, and without injury, at some sac rifices, for economic reasons, the victims may have been sick and feeble (108). Varrò's quote suggests that this was in actuality often the case (quite contrary to the professed Roman religious custom of keeping sacrificial vic tims in optimum health). Cato (De agri cult. 2,7) instructs discarding animals grown old, or used to the point of ill health (while still attempting to procure a final profit): Pecus consideret.

Sell worn-out oxen, blemished cattle, blem ished sheep, wool, hides, an old wagon, old tools, an old slave, a sickly slave, and whatever else is superfluous. The master should have the selling habit, not the buy ing habit. This infamous line, often cited for its callous instruction to sell off "super fluous" old or sick slaves, we should note just as coldly, and with just as much ingratitude, instructs the same of "blemished" sheep and cattle, and the "worn-out" oxen that provided their lives of hard labour, sustenance and economic benefit. Regarding dogs, in De re rust. 2, 8-9, Varrò instructs that if a litter is large, one should keep some pups and dispose of the others; he instructs that when dogs show displeasure at being tied, they should be beaten; and he tells us that as a matter of course, dogs were often killed by "wild" boars during hunts. Interestingly, Varrò tells us "the food of dogs is more like that of man than that of sheep: they eat scraps of meat and bones, not grass and leaves" (cibatus canis propior homittis quam ovis: pascitur etiitn eduliis et ossibus, non herbis autfronde). This quote suggests that Roman citizens may not have followed a primarily vegetarian Mediterranean diet. A diet heavy in flesh would have contributed greatly to animal abuse and environmental degra dation.1 Domesticated animals were treated poorly where it might increase 1 Another passage indicating a Roman diet (albeit, an elite Roman diet) rich in animal flesh is Plutarch's touching objection in Moralia: Άλλ' ουδέν ήμάς δυσωπεΐ, ού χρόας άνθηρον είδος, ού φωνής έμμελοϋς πιθανότης, ού το καθάριον εν διαίτη και περιττόν έν συνέσει των άθλιων, άλλά σαρκιδίου μικροϋ χάριν άφαιρούμεθα ψυχής ήλιον, φως, τον τοϋ βίου χρόνον, εφ' φ γέγονε καί πέφυκεν. είθ' ας φθέγγεται και διατρίζει φωνάς άνάρθρους είναι δοκοϋμεν, ού παραιτήσεις καί δεήσεις και δικαιολογίας εκάστου λέγοντος "ού παραιτούμαι σου την άνάγκην άλλα την υβριν· 'ίνα φάγης άπόκτεινον, ίνα δ' ήδιον φάγης μή μ' άναίρει". ώ τής ώμότητος· δεινόν μέν έστι καί τιθεμένην ΐδεΐν τράπεζαν άνθρώπων πλουσίων ώς νεκροκόμοις χρωμένων μαγείροις καί όψοποιοΐς, δεινότερον δ' άποκομιζομένην πλείονα γαρ τά λειπόμενα των βεβρωμένων εστίν, ούκοϋν ταϋτα μάτην άπέθανεν. έτεροι δέ φειδόμενοι των παρατεθέντων ούκ έώσι τέμνειν ούδέ κατακόπτειν, παραιτούμενοι νεκρά, ζώντων δ' ούκ έφείσαντο, "But nothing shames us, not the flower-like tinting of the flesh, not the persuasiveness of the harmonious voice, not the cleanliness of their habits or the unusual intelligence that may be found in the poor wretches.

FOSS profit, and non-domesticated animals were persecuted and driven out from areas where they could not compete for the vast land and resources required for pasturage.1 In sacrifice to the gods, communal rituals did not centre only on distri bution of meat, whereby victims were bled to death. In the Cerialia, an event honouring Ceres (the Roman goddess of agriculture), foxes were burned alive with flaming torches tied to their backs; as may have been bulls in the Ludi Taurei (Kalof 28). The army frequently used animals in warfare: de ployed as equipment, decoys, and weapons; one method, attempted at least once, was to cover living pigs with tar, light them on fire and send them squealing in pain into enemy lines (Kalof 26). Varrò attests that horses were bred for different purposes: some for military service, others for hauling, others for racing. Some were used sole ly for breeding, which entails of course they would be forced to mate. Among humans this would be designated as rape, and Varrò provides an ecdotal evidence that some horses could resent such treatment (De re rust. 2, 7, 9): Tametsi incredibile, quod usu venit, memoriae mandandum. Equus matrem salire cum adduci non posset, cum eum capite obvoluto auriga adduxisset et coegisset matrem inire, cum descendenti dempsisset ab oculis, ille impetum fecit in eum ac mordicus interfecit. Though it is incredible, as it actually happened the following story should be recorded: when a horse could not be induced to mount his dam, the groom cov ered his head, led him up, and forced him to do so; but when he took the cloth from the horse's eyes after he had come down, the horse dashed at him and killed him with his teeth. In De re rust. 2,8 and 9, Varrò tells us donkeys and horses were forced to have cross-species sex in order to produce mules. In the same passages he tells us that newly born ass colts were stripped from their nursing mothers and placed under mares (as it was believed this would make them bigger and stronger), and that pairs of male donkeys drew all vehicles on the roads. In look on when the tables of the rich are spread, men who employ cooks and spicers to groom the dead! And it is even more terrible to look on when they are taken away, for more is left than has been eaten. So the beasts died for nothing! There are others who refuse when the dishes are already set before them and will not have them cut into or sliced. Though they bid spare the dead, they did not spare the living" (Plut. De esu cam. 994e-f). 1 During the Republican period, extensive latifundia, (large estates) significantly concerned with "livestock", had taken over the Italian countryside. Conversion from crop production to grazing became so widespread that, from the late Republic onward, grain had to be imported into Italy from the provinces (Hughes 145-146).</page><page sequence="17">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS 111 2, 6, Varrò instructs that donkeys (social animals) should only be grouped together to form pack trains; otherwise, they should soon (at a young age) be separated from their social groupings and sent to the mills, or to the fields for hauling, or even for ploughing. In the same passage, he tells us that male asses should be kept in a state of perpetual labour, so as not to lose vigour. In the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, the human character of Lucius is trapped in the body of a donkey; his observations and experiences provide some insight into the fate of these animals: 9, « Ibi complurium iumentorum multivii circuitus intorquebant molas ambage varia nec die tantum verum perperi etiam nocte prorsus instabili machinarum vertigine lucubrabant pervigilem farinam. There, many mules perpetually went round and round turning a number of mills, not just by day, but indeed, they kept at it even by night; they made flour through the small hours at the ever-turning machines.1 9,i3 ... ad quem modum memorem? Quales illi muli senes vel cantherii debiles. Circa praesepium capita demersi contruncabant moles palearum, cervices cariosa vulnerum putredine follicantes, nares languidas adsiduo pulsu tussedinis hiulci, pectora copulae spartae tritura continua exulcerati, costas perpetua castigatione ossium tenus renudati, ungulas multivia circumcursione in enorme vestigium porrecti totumque corium veterno atque scabiosa macie exasperati. ... and how should I speak of them such as they were, old mules and worn out geld ings. Around the manger they ducked their heads and ate their heaps of straw; their necks furrowed and eaten away by stinking sores, their nostrils wracked by a con stant cough, chest alcerated by the constant rubbing of the harness, flanks laid bare to the bone by incessent beatings, their hoofs splayed out to enormous dimensions by the constant turning, and their coats ragged with old age and mange. 7,15 ... molae machinariae subiugum me dedit frondosoque baculo subinde castigans panem sibi suisque de meo parabat corio.

Donkeys were a ubiquitous sight turning the grindstones in Classical Greece, and must have also been a continuous presense in the larger baking mills of densly populated Roman urban centres (Humphrey, Oleson and Sherwood 149)·</page><page sequence="18">112 THEODORE F.

The Graeco-Roman Tradition of Metaphorical Abuse 4.1. Elegiac Animal Metaphor in Ovid Apuleius is a good place to find evidence of violence towards animals in Lat in fictional prose, as the above passages attest. Ovidian poetry, however, may be the best place to find mention of animals in bad situations, typically as similes, in the form of very short but powerful emblematic images.2 In Ovid's Metamorphoses, Fasti, and Heroid.es, we regularly see metaphor ical cruelty indicative of real life for animals, but never representing animals. To elicit sympathy for humans, Ovid describes cattle galled by yokes, oxen bleeding at altars, cows lowing in distress at seeing their calves slain, horses submitting reluctantly to bridles, deer fleeing in fear from hunting dogs, an imals doomed to die in arenas, boars attacked by hunting dogs, dogs killed by boars, lions speared by hunters, and cubs stolen from distraught lioness es (Wilkins 81-82). The same pervasive metaphorical language that provides such fertile ev idence of systemic injustices may also contribute to these injustices. Ovid's particular contribution to an oppressive cultural construct of animals comes 1 The Metamorphoses is a book known for its exaggeration for rhetorical effect, however when considered with the previous examples I have provided, as well as ample other evi dence readily found of the poor treatment of donkeys in antiquity, Apuleius' descriptions of animal abuse certainly ring of truth. I have chosen these passages because they are sen sitive and poignant (qualities not often encountered in ancient accounts of animals). 2 Aristotle was the first to write a theory of [metaphorical] comparisons (Walde): εστίν δέ και ή είκών μεταφορά: διαφέρει γάρ μικρόν: βταν μεν γαρ είπη [τον Αχιλλέα] "ώς δε λέων έπόρουσεν", είκών έστιν, δταν δέ "λέων έπόρουσε", μεταφορά: διά γάρ το άμφω άνδρείους είναι, προσηγόρευσεν μετενέγκας λέοντα τον 'Αχιλλέα. 2. χρήσιμον δέ ή είκών καί έν λόγω, όλιγάκις δέ· ποιητικον γάρ. οίστέαι δέ ώσπερ αί μεταφοραί" μεταφοραί γάρ είσι, διαφέρουσαι τω είρημένω, "The simile also is a metaphor; for there is very little difference. When the po et says of Achilles, "he rushed on like a lion", it is a simile; if he says, "a lion, he rushed on", it is a metaphor; for because both are courageous, he transfers the sense and calls Achilles a lion [Horn. II. 22.164 ένάντιον ώρτο λεών ώς]. 2. The simile is also useful in prose, but should be less frequently used, for there is something poetical about it. Similes must be used like metaphors, which only differ in the manner stated" (Rhet. 3, 4).</page><page sequence="19">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS 113 mainly in his depictions of them as nearly always servile.1 But never is the reader invited to consider the animals themselves, whose servile functions and beaten conditions are simply an accepted fact of life (so much so that they can be used in language as prototypical models of suffering). In the elegiac writing of Ovid, imagery of animal oppression is a device to describe the situation of lovelorn humans. In the collections Amoves ("Loves") and Ars amatoria ("The Art of Love"), there are sixty-eight pas sages referring to animals (seventeen in the former;2 fifty-one in the latter).3 Very few of these show them in a state of freedom; we can count only three which do: at Am. 2,14, 35-36 tiger and lion mothers tend their cubs; at Ars amat. 1, 93-96 busy ants and bees converge for sustenance, and at 2,373-379 a "savage" boar defends himself from dogs, a lioness feeds her cubs, and a tiny adder is stepped upon by a careless human. Most of Ovid's depictions are of servility involving domestication, or the cruel taming that often precedes domestication (Russell 286). Ovid observes that no ox loves the yoke, but is stuck with what he hates (Am. 3,11B 4-5); he describes restive horses endur ing wolf-curbs (jagged mouthpieces) (Am. 1,2,15-16; 2,9,29-30), ploughmen yoking up "limping oxen" (tardos boves) for work (Am. 1, 13, 16), horses whipped in races (Am. 3,2,10-11), bulls broken and horses subdued (Ari amat. 1,19-29), donkeys protesting at mill-stones (Ars amat. 3,289-290), horses bur dened by soldiers (Ars amat. 1,364), galloping horses spurred (Ars amat. 2,136 137; 2, 138-139; 2, 341-342; 2, 731-732), and cows dragged "undeserving" (tn meritam) from the herd to be yoked to the plow (Ars amat. 1,316-318). As mythical subjects, even free animals are depicted as domesticated or tamed in Ovid:4 in Am. 1, 2, 47-48, and Ari amat. 1, 560, Bacchus (the god of 1 As social constructions are the products of constant societal interaction and exchange of ideas, and cannot be solely attributed to any single individual (Stibbe 47), I do not pre sume any statement on Ovid's intentions, which are irrelevant. 2 References to animals in Amores: 1, 1, 59; 1, 2,15-16; 1, 2, 23; 1, 2, 47-48; 1, 6,13; 1, 7, 5-6; 1, 7, 7-8; 1, 7, 50; 1,10, 25 ff.; 1,13,17; 2, 9, 29-30; 2,14, 35-36; 2,16, 49-50; 3, 2,10-11; 3,11B 4-5; 3,12, 21-22; 3,12,36. 3 References to animals in Ars amatoria: 1,19-29; 1, 45-48; 1, 67; 1, 93-96; 1,135 ff.; 1,187; 1, 211; 1, 215; 1, 218; 1, 264-274; 1, 279-282; 1, 316-318; 1, 319-323; 1, 333; 1, 349-351; 1, 364; 1, 391-394; 1, 471-473; 1, 560; 1, 629-630; 1, 762-766; 2, 2; 2, 76; 2,136-37; 2,138-139; 2,147-150; 2,183-184; 2,190; 2, 341-342; 2, 373-379; 2, 471-475; 2, 480-489; 2, 615-616; 2, 731-732; 3, 7-10; 3, 35-36; 3, 46-47; 3, 83 84; 3,112-115; 3,120; 3,193-194; 3,249; 3,321-326; 3,395-396; 3,420-421; 3,426-429; 3,554-556; 3,594 595; 3. 661-663; 3, 669-671; 3, 810. 4 It is typical in Graeco-Roman literary tradition that wild animals are symbols of some thing needing taming, with a nature god or goddess doing the taming: cf. adiunxere feras, quia quamvis effera proles officiis debet molliti vieta parentum / / [to the chariot of Cybele] they've yoked the wild beasts, since a progeny, however savage, must be tamed and chid by care of parents (Lucr.

FOSS wine) is drawn by tigers, who are presented not as free creatures of the forest, but as draft animals for an anthropomorphic god representing the forest. We can see here a reflection of the attitude of Romans in the real world: physical possession and ownership regarding all animals were deeply entrenched by the time of Ovid. Going back to the Twelve Tables (lex duodecim tabularum),1 the legal term for a free animal was "nobody's pos session" (res nullius). Res nullius was "a category animals shared with unoc cupied lands, abandoned property, precious stones, hidden treasure, and the property of an enemy captured in war;" an animal was a thing, not a being, and, if belonged to nobody, became property as soon as claimed (Wise 33). Ovid's portrayal of Bacchus subjugating wild animals would have played a part in upholding the wider cultural narrative serving to justify that animals and nature (animals are often portrayed merely symbols of nature) are prop erly under human domain. Only Amores 2,14,35-36 could possibly be taken as a representation of an imals meant to be respected or admired: vestra quid effoditis subiectis viscera telis, et nondum natis dira venena datis... ... hoc neque in Armeniis tigres fecere latebris, perdere nec fetus ausa leaena suos. at tenerae faciunt... Why do you gouge out your offspring with exposing sharp tools, and give dire drugs to your unborn... ... this neither the Armenian tiger in her lair has done nor has the lioness attempted to destroy her own foetus. But tender girls do... In this passage, Ovid invites the reader to think of lions and tigers as repre sentations of kinder nature, while at the same time emphasizing their "sav agery". Ovid forwards the idea that abortions go against natural order, with the lion and tiger representing that order. In this case, for a human to act in accordance with nature is supposed to be a good thing. The differences be tween civilized humans and uncivilized beasts are stressed, as even (pre sumably bloodthirsty and cruel) "wild" cats of the forests would not harm their young, whereas a human female might. In other words, she who should naturally be kind and "humane" by virtue of being a young human female, but instead is so hardhearted as to kill her foetus, acts in a manner 1 It is assumed the "Law of the Twelve Tables" (the most important law of the Roman Republic) was written around 450 BCE; this is because many writers after this period include references to the Tables in their historical accounts of legislative processes (see Livy, Ab urbe cond. 3, 32 ff.) (Schiemann).</page><page sequence="21">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS 115 so cruel as to be more savage than a ferocious carnivore (note the mutually reinforcing sexist/speciesist language). The personal beinghood (of the lion or tiger) is not recognized here; the animals are only symbolic: kind in ma ternal instincts, but "savage" as "wild beasts". As Ovid consistently assigns animals the task of metaphorical tools, either as exemplars of specific hu man behaviour, as examples of savagery, or (as is more typical for Ovid) in conveying the bad situations and feelings of human characters, he reduces their real servitude further to literary servitude. The descriptions conveyed through animal representation provide no comment on the nameless ani mals themselves. To listeners and readers of Ovid (in ancient Rome and throughout the ages), this literary demotion conveys messages of hatred or indifference, and functions in a vicious cycle to reflect as well as influence how they are treated in the real world (Stibbe 47). In this singularity of rep resentation (of animals as symbols), Ovid reinforces the typical Roman con ception of animals in the world (things to be owned and used, to whatever purpose and in whatever manner humans see fit). Again, we should also note that the vast majority of Ovid's symbolic animal depictions are of servitude, reinforcing their supposedly inherent positions under humanity. In spite of this, Ovid is often regarded as more sympathetic towards an imals than most ancient writers,1 and indeed we see his descriptions are filled with pathos, if only metaphorical. However, as it was the quality of reason which set the bar for how one should be treated, animals to fare better by humans in the real world, they would have to be endowed with such quality by Roman writers and thinkers, which Ovid never accounts for in any of his elegies (to be sure, he explicitly states in Amoves that they are without).2 As Ovid is well known for his playful irony and literary self-conscious ness, I would like to comment briefly on an example of Ovidian irony that uses traditional representations of animals in a way unique to erotic elegy. The lover in elegy is often presented as a metaphorical predator or hunter cArs amat. 2, 363-368; 3, 7-9; 3, 46-48; 3, 419-423; 3, 659-663; 3, 669-671). In Ars amatoria, referring to the male elegiac lover, Ovid declares that Romans hate hawks and wolves for their predatory natures (2,148-149): Odimus accipitrem, quia vivit semper in armis, Et pavidum solitos in pecus ire lupos. 1 See Newmyer, 'Philosophy' 114, also West, 66-86, who discusses several secondary sources on what he terms Ovid's "sympathetic impulse", and examines many passages of Ovid directly, including the often cited speech of Pythagoras about vegetarianism (Met. 15, 89-546). 2 "...take for example farm animals, devoid of reason..." (sumite in exemplum pecudes ratione carentes.Am. 1,10,25).</page><page sequence="22">il 6 THEODORE F. FOSS We hate the hawk because he always lives in arms, and the wolf whose custom is to raid the timid flocks. Roman farmers generally would have indeed disliked hawks, wolves, and any other predators that took a toll on their monetarily valuable "livestock". Ovid presents himself as the predator here, thus meant to be admired for his prowess, but feared and loathed for his destructive power (in elegiac fash ion, humorously relating to the erotic pursuit of women). This is a tongue in-cheek play on traditional Roman literary characterizations of dangerous humans as animals (I will comment soon on the traditional characterization in passages of Sallust). However, beyond the literary intention, there is an other level of irony: for the Romans, the epitome of a military people, to hate another animal "because he always lives in arms" (quia vivit semper in armis) is ironic to the point of absurdity. Presumably the connection is not made (neither by Ovid nor his readers /listeners) that human farmers too, when they kill for flesh, function as predators - from which prey often meet fates worse than hawks or wolves (Stibbe 53) (I have already described the myriad abuses inflicted on animals designated as agricultural, such as con sistently addressed in Ovid). In the instance of this passage, Ovid reflects (and as an influential poet, directs) a clear case of "our side bias" (i.e., if we inflict violence, it is justified and necessary; if they inflict violence, it is to be condemned), thus projecting unreasonable condemnation and perpetuat ing hostility towards free carnivorous animals in the real world. We might note too the double standard that human omnivores (in most circum stances, animal consumption optional and unnecessary) would pass judge ment on obligate carnivores. Unlike with predatory wolves and hawks, most of Ovid's representations deal with docile domesticated animals, and therefore (in keeping with tra ditional Roman literary characterizations, of which I will soon discuss) sym pathy is often elicited in the representations-but again, for the sake of hu mans. Ovid nearly always depicts animals in a light that debases them, and though their ignominy might derive from their actual treatment by Ro mans, they are debased further when they are regularly portrayed as metaphorical images of domestication and abuse. So, although Ovid's de scriptions might be full of indirect pathos for their metaphorical subjects, they nevertheless repeatedly reinforce the message of an exploitative socie ty: animals are firmly set in their assigned places serving humans (Mason 39). Animals in Roman society are used as food, clothing, transportation, beasts of burden, sources of entertainment, decorations, and all-around economic commodities; then they are further exploited when their real pain under human hands is used solely as metaphorical material meant to con vey things of significance to their oppressors only.</page><page sequence="23">ROMAN IDEAS IN THE LATE REPUBLIC ABOUT ANIMALS 117 4.2. Human Animals, Nonhuman Characteristics: Similes in Homer and Semonides The use of animals to signify human characteristics (dispositions, behav iours and personas), as well as (usually unpleasant) human situations (as in Ovid), forms an integral part of a very long and rich Graeco-Roman narra tive tradition. This tradition goes back to the earliest literature of classical antiquity. By John Heath's account, there are one hundred and twenty five animal similes in the Iliad alone: warriors (characteristically) torrent like bees (II. 2, 86), march like rams (3,196), pace like beasts (3, 449), rush like wolves (16,156), attack like lions (5,136-144), fight like boars (12,145), race like horses (22,22), swoop like eagles (15,690), scream like vultures (16,428), bel low like bulls (21, 403), low like cows (17, 5), tremble like deer (13,100), and (situationally) get trapped like fish (5, 487), or pent up like sheep (7, 129) (Heath 43).1 In conventional usage, animal metaphors used to outline human behav iour present their subjects in a negative or positive light. Positive animals represent innocence, purity, and sometimes benign aspects of the natural world (early examples would be Io, caught up between the scheming of Zeus and jealousy of Hera, or Silvia's stag as sacrificial victim to the gods in order to insure Aeneas' success in Italy). Negative animals convey what is base and appetitive in humans (early examples are Circe's pigs transformed from Odysseus' careless crew, Plato's cattle representing appetitive men (Resp. 9, 586a-b 5),2 and the animals whence Semonides claims human females were created) (Saylor 306). 1 All examples are stock images used in the Iliad. Line numbers refer to the Greek text. 2 Plato's Socrates declares the following: οί άρα φρονήσεως και άρετης άπειροι, εύωχίαις 8ε καί τοις τοιούτοις άεί συνόντες, κάτω, ώς έοικεν, καί μέχρι πάλιν προς τά μεταξύ φέρονται τε και ταύτη πλανώνται διά βίου, ΰπερβάντες δε τοϋτο προς το άληθώς άνω οΰτε άνέβλεψαν πώποτε οΰτε ήνέχθησαν, ούδέ τοϋ οντος τω οντι έπληρώθησαν, ούδέ βέβαιου τε και καθαρας ηδονής έγεύσαντο, άλλά βοσκημάτων δίκην κάτω άεί βλέποντες καί κεκυφότες εις γην καί εις τραπέζας βόσκονται χορταζόμενοι καί όχεύοντες, καί ένεκα της τούτων πλεονεξίας λακτίζοντες καί κυρίττοντες άλλήλους σιδηροΐς κέρασί τε καί όπλαΐς άποκτεινύασι δι* άπληστίαν, άτε ουχί τοις ούσιν ούδέ το δν ούδε τό στέγον έαυτών πιμπλάντες, "[humans who have no experience] of wisdom and virtue, but are ever devoted to feastings and that sort of thing, are swept downward, it seems, and back again to the center, and so sway and roam to and fro throughout their lives, but they have never transcended all this and turned their eyes to the true upper region nor been wafted there, nor ever been really filled with real things, nor ever tasted stable and pure pleasure, but with eyes ever bent upon the earth and heads bowed down over their tables they feast like cattle, grazing and copulating, ever greedy for more of these delights; and in their greed kicking and butting one another with horns and hooves of iron they slay one another in sateless avidity, because they are vainly striving to satisfy with things that are not real the unreal and incontinent part of their souls" (Resp. 9,586a-b).</page><page sequence="24">ιι8 THEODORE F. FOSS According to Semonides, filthy and lazy women were created by the gods from pigs (7,1-5); wicked, moody, and conniving women were created from foxes (6-11); nosy, noisy, gossipy and garrulous women, from dogs (12-21); hardworking women, who endure beatings well, but continuously desire food and sexual gratification, come from donkeys (42-49); thieving, sex crazed, unscrupulous and undesirable women come from weasels (50-55); beautiful and vain spendthrifts come from horses (56-69); and the greatest pain of all to men comes from nonhuman primates of some sort (70-83). The only women gratifying to men come from industrious bees (84-94).1 Semonides exploits stereotypes of different animals in order to outline stereotypes of women. University of Waterloo 1 It may be significant that the only good animal is furthest in type from human (an in sect), and that the most disagreeable animal is closest to human (a primate): linguistic sep aration serves humans in emotionally distancing themselves from others they wish to ex ploit (Leach 50-51).
