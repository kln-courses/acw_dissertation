<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shogakai: Celebrity Banquets of the Late Edo Period ANDREW MARKUS University of Washington THE importance of communal or cooperative effort in the creative world of the late Edo period needs little emphasis: kyoka, senryu, and haikai poetry flourished among circles of dedicated amateurs; late Edo gesaku fiction owed its success to the close col- laboration of author and artist, later relay teams of authors and art- ists. Less well known in this gregarious history of shared creativity is the institution of the shogakai A,iA- literally, "calligraphy and painting gathering" -which reached its zenith in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Outwardly, the shogakai was a cultivated symposium, a convivial banquet at which the host and his invited associates produced spontaneous examples of their art or ingenuity. In the course of its development, however, the shogakai embodied less exalted motives: a desire to publish one's name, or inflate a mediocre reputation; the ambition to outdo one's rivals in sheer numbers and ostentation; and most importantly, a craving to trans- mute the intangibles of talent and reputation into hard currency. Always a self-conscious spectacle, the institution provoked horror, amusement, or some measure of both among the literary figures who, increasingly, figured among its attractions. Striking among the characteristics of the shogakai is the vari- able nature of the institution. In the Kansai area, the term re- tained much of its literal meaning, and referred primarily to open 135</page><page sequence="2">136 ANDREW MARKUS exhibitions of recent, but already existing samples of graphic art. For a nominal fee, amateurs or professional artists and calligra- phers, even from remote provinces, could secure exhibition of their works before an appreciative paying public. No formal affiliation was required-a boon to exhibitors, and perhaps the central appeal of the Kansai shogakai at its inception.' While there are records of comparable exhibitions in the East, the Edo-style shogakai, which emphasized an exchange of impromptu productions, was clearly distinct from its Kansai namesake.2 Even within the boundaries of the Edo shogakai, the spirit of the gather- ings altered substantially over the decades. From exclusive func- tions restricted to a select elite of invited friends, the banquets evolved into mammoth galas, open indiscriminately to any citizen able to afford a ticket; where early shogakai convened to honor one or two central figures, the later shogakai deliberately assembled whole constellations of luminaries, from the most varied fields of creative endeavor; what had been dignified and amicable exchanges of tokens of one's talent degenerated into "autograph parties"' con- ducted amidst the din of laughter and clattering dishes. Documentation of the occurrence of shogakai is extensive, though often shallow. Little evidence remains of the interaction or program at the banquets, or samples of the works generated on the occa- sions.3 What depictions do exist exaggerate the negative, risible aspects of the gatherings, and intimate that little constructive good, and possibly much harm resulted from them. We may not be quite as quick as contemporaries, however, to accord the shogakai a sum- mary dismissal. The frequency and huge numbers of participants in 1 On the nature and development of the Kansai shogakai, see Kobayashi Tadashi 'J4ti,YP, "Edo jidai no shogakai: sekiga-kai to andepandan-ten," in Tokugawa no heiwa, ed.

The vaguely laudatory inscrip- tion, on the splendor and general auspiciousness of the occasion, appears transcribed by Tsurumine Shigenobu MWWTAE (1788-1859) in his "Kaisei manroku," Hyakka zuihitsu, (Kokusho kank6kai, 1918), 3.60.

The convocation, however temporary, of the foremost figures of the arts and letters provokes our interest, as does the diversity of the participants. Practitioners of calligraphy and nanga painting shared cups with ukiyo-e artists and publishers; Confucian authorities mingled with comedians and popular au- thors; women, though a decided minority, presided alongside their male artistic peers. The vitality and development of the Edo shogakai suggest, provocatively, an altering ambition among contemporary artists or authors that transcended the esteem of their masters, fellow disciples, or immediate public: nothing less than universal recognition among all creative figures, and throughout all segments of the general public as a "celebrity" (meijin ;A) was an acceptable definition of success. There is no single prototype, no reputed founder for the Edo shogakai, which probably evolved from existing varieties of literary gatherings.4 Buko nenpyJ AZVi: (Annals of Edo; first installment 1849), in its comprehensive annual survey of cultural events of note in the metropolis, specifies that the earliest shogakai was held by a cer- tain Donki , a monk in Kamakura, during the Kansei period (1789-1801).5 Ota Nanpo (1749-1823), the ubiquitous arbiter of contemporary elegance, attended in 1792 a demonstration of extem- porized artwork sponsored by Tani Buncho (1763-1840) and his clan-wife, sister, and assorted disciples. In the margin of the memento he carried away from the occasion, a delighted Nanpo later asserted that this event, in fact, marked the genesis of the modern shogakai.6 Whatever its origins, the institution rapidly took root in the cultural circles of the early 1800s: already by 1810, a 4 Yamagata Atsuz6 1QWXIA Geien sjwa (Yoshikawa Hanshichi, 1897), 1.54 cites as a possible precursor the convivial banquets organized in Kyoto by Ryu Soro -A-: (1714?- 1792); see mention in Kobayashi, "Edo jidai no shogakai," p. 171. 5 Sait6, Buko nenpyf, 2.19 lists Donki's shogakai in its general survey of noteworthy trends throughout the Kansei period, and alludes to the "recently published" Meika shogadan (Collo- quies of famous masters on calligraphy and painting)-a title I have not been able to trace. 6 Kobayashi, "Edo jidai no shogakai," p. 167. The transplantation of this Kansai institu- tion might have been part of Tani Bunch6's larger program to strengthen the vitality of the arts in Edo. Also very early among Edo shogakai is a gathering held at the Kurumaya restaurant in the Shiba Shinmei district, probably in autumn 1803. Among the guests of note figured the kyoka</page><page sequence="4">138 ANDREW MARKUS machifure or general edict from the magistracies of Edo warned against excessive spending at shogakai, and covered them under the same rubric as musical recitals, "name inauguration" (nahirome M SL (^b)) banquets, and similar public displays of artistic achieve- ment.7 From its inception and throughout its evolution, a strong degree of commercialism pervaded the shogakai. This financial concern, indeed, may have been the cardinal criterion to differentiate the shogakai from the plethora of voluntary, more narrowly literary or academic "associations" (kai) prominent in nineteenth-century Edo. In its classic form, the Edo shogakai resembled in many of its specifics a modern fund-raising dinner. After setting a date and reserving a sizable room, usually in a restaurant accustomed to such events, the sponsor (kaishu) would make the rounds of his closest friends and most illustrious associates, in hopes of winning their luster as subsidiary attractions to his banquet. The names of the celebrities scheduled to attend, posted on a sort of marquee or printed as handbills, became the prime attraction of the shogakai for the general public. On the specified date, if all went well, large throngs of an admiring public, eager to consort at close range with celebrities from all disciplines, purchased admission to the ban- quet- a price that hovered typically around one shu ( = one-sixteenth ryo ).8 This revenue from admissions was the main source of income authority Shikatsube Magao (1752-1829), the authors Shikitei Sanba and Sakuragawa Jihinari (1762-1833), the senior ukiyo-e master Utagawa Toyoharu (1735-1814) and his two outstanding disciples Toyokuni and Toyohiro (1773-1828). See Nobuhiro Shinji 9Ojs, "Shogakai no ichi-shiry6," Shoshigaku geppo 24 (1985): 16-18.

Guests were expected to purchase separately meal-tickets (zen-fuda) and side dish tokens (sakana-fuda) before sitting down to their repast. Etiquette, and occasionally house rules demanded that participants provide a gratuity to each celebrity before requesting a souvenir inscription or sketch.9 On the debit side of the ledger, the costs of the banquet to the operator were considerable: in addition to the basic costs of the facility, catered meals, attendants and entertainers, the sponsor was expected to pro- vide fans, squares of silk, and other door gifts in their hundreds as favors to the paying guests. Kameda B6sai's (1752-1826) payment to the actor Ichikawa Danjuro VII (1791-1859) during the course of a particularly lavish shogakai in 1823, while cited as an example of his largesse, suggests that the participation of adjunct celebrities at the banquets was not always volunteered on a charitable basis. 1 Despite the very heavy capital outlay, however, the profits in cash and in that more precious commodity, prestige, were enough to en- sure the viability of the institution for many decades. Profit was the prime motive of the first indisputable example of the Edo shogakai, sponsored in June 1792 by the Tsuruya Kiemon/ Senkakud6 and Tsutaya Juzabur6/K6shod6 publishing houses for the benefit of young Santo Ky6den (1761-1816). ' The event- possibly initiated as a form of reparation for Ky6den's grave per- sonal losses after his prosecution for obscenity in the summer of 9 Campbell, "Tenp6-ki zengo no shogakai," pp. 59 and 61 quotes a hikifuda publicity flyer distributed by the sewa-nin or caterer, Kobund6, in 1857, which enjoins guests to offer gratuities after requesting contributions to shoga-cho souvenir albums, on fans, or "samplers" of multiple inscriptions. (Students injuku private academies are, however, exempt from the prescription.) 'O Stephen Addiss, The World of Kameda Bisai (New Orleans: New Orleans Museum of Art, 1984), p. 95. The honorarium to Danjur6 far exceeded in value the nominal gifts the actor and his disciples presented to the guest of honor. Ichikawa Danjur6 VII was apparently prominent in shogakai circles of the 1830s: Nanka no yume by Heitei Ginkei features a preface by the actor, and portrays him conspicuously in the first panel of the composite portrait frontispieces to the work; see Heitei, "Nanka no yume," pp. 357 and 358. " Two very similar accounts of this occasion are [Kyokutei Bakin], "Iwade mo no ki," Shin Ensekijisshu (Kokusho kank6kai, 1913), 4.190, and Sant6 Ky6zan [?], "Sant6 Ky6den ichidaiki," Zoku Ensekijisshu (Kokusho kank6kai, 1909), 2.182.

Thanks to this capital, Ky6den was able to make a new start, and purchase his small, but eventually highly lucrative shop in the Ky6bashi district for a commerce in tobacco pouches and kiseru pipes. The escalating commercialism of the ventures, and the increasing transparency of their veneer of elegance exasperated Kyokutei Bakin (1767-1848), who made no secret of his irritation in letters ad- dressed during 1818 to his provincial literary correspondent Suzuki Bokushi %tKVW (1770-1842). Invitations to the functions, Bakin in- sists, are unwelcome intrusions into his agreeable isolation: A great many of the friends of my youth have departed this world already, while those still alive have become remote. The reason is, quite simply, that I have given up all "elegant" socializing, and ceased visits to others' homes. Every time a messenger arrives with a printed announcement [surimono] for a shogakai or some other gathering, I dismiss him with a nominal contribution to the occasion, and do not actually attend. The friends I can claim today, in consequence, are friends in name only; all are remote.12 The functions, in Bakin's eyes, are unedifying spectacles of escalat- ing greed: I am ashamed to sound so vituperative in saying so, but of late all authors or artists hold these shogakai affairs at the slightest provocation-conspiracies to scrape up some ready cash. Few indeed are the invited guests who attend gladly; most par- ticipate, faces set in a "grin and bear it" expression (as the colloquialism has it). The perpetrators strip you of one nanryo [=2-1/2 shu]-why, it is virtually an elegant sort of highway robbery! They may be great figures, "Master This" or "Professor That," but few fail to resort to this expedient for a livelihood. I have resolved, sir, that I will never do such a thing."3 Vainglory, in addition to profit, was a considerable inducement for potential sponsors. Bakin's criticism of the pettiness of each minor figure who styled himself sensei ("master") illustrates that the banquets in many cases celebrated a fame without much foundation 12 Kyokutei Bakin, "Suzuki Bokushi ni at6ru fumi," in Kyokutei iko, ed.

Even when the fame of the sponsor was merited, how- ever, the temptation toward ostentation, or a peacock display of all the figures willing to muster at one's request, was very real. Shikitei Sanba's (1776-1822) two-day shogakai, conducted in May 1811, commemorated his great success with Ukiyo-buro (Bathhouse of the floating world, 1809-1813).'4 The gala occasion, which includ- ed participants from every segment of the publishing industry, ukiyo-e figures like Utagawa Toyokuni (1769-1825) and Kunisada (1786-1865), and fellow authors Sant6 Ky6den and Sant6 Ky6zan (1769-1858) demonstrated Sanba's affluence, as well as the new eminence of his renown. As shogakai banquets increased in frequency and dimensions, an entire specialty industry arose to accommodate their accelerating needs. While temples or private homes on occasion served as gather- ing places for the participants, the largest restaurants of Edo were the most frequent locales. The preferred district was Yanagibashi, at the confluence of the Kanda and Sumida Rivers, a hub of river traffic. Originally a bustling point of embarkation for pleasure launches or for discreet ferry service to the Yoshiwara or Fukagawa pleasure districts, Yanagibashi soon acquired a lively character of its own. All four of the restaurants that prominently advertise kashli- zashiki rental banqueting facilities in a classified business directory of 1824 are in the Yanagibashi or Ryogoku Bridge district immedi- ately adjacent. 15 Most celebrated among all locations for the banquets and virtual- ly synonymous with the institutional shogakai was the Man'ya Hachirobei 7/5NIA gX of Yanagibashi-universally known by the 14 Sanba describes the two-day event, "a success beyond all expectations," in Shikitei San- ba, "Shikitei zakki," Zoku Ensekijisshu (Kokusho kank6kai, 1908), 1.49-51 (entry for Bunka 8:3:12/May 4, 1811). The location was the Nakamuraya Heikichi restaurant in Onoe-ch6, at the eastern end of Ry6goku Bridge-a major concentration of light amusements and carnival entertainments. 15 General information on Yanagibashi from Sat6 Y6jin fMA, "Yanagibashi," Edo bungaku chimeijiten, 1973 ed.

Only four of these establish- ments (Kawachiya Hanjir6 and Man'ya Hachirobei of Yanagibashi; Nakamuraya Heikichi and Mikawaya Rin'emon of Onoe-ch6, in east Ry6goku), however, prominently advertise kashi-zashiki rental banquet facilities.

Sanba was entirely satisfied with the Senmentei and their smooth handling of his 1811 shogakai: not only did the firm supply a staff of uniformed, highly professional sword- and footwear-checkers to supervise the guests' belongings, they also provided, against the security of a damage deposit, carpets, inkstones, and other fur- nishings.

Bakin's halfhearted protests against the distasteful prospect of their participation at his banquet in 1836 were to no avail.23 At least one source suggests that certain classes of geisha, with a literary or calligraphic flair, made a specialty of shogakai, while Hio Keizan HfiilL0[ (1789-1859) describes a discriminating geisha at one event whose expression betrayed too plainly her displeasure at the butterfly sketch and trite Chinese quotation he had inscribed on the tails of her obi.24 In addition to large numbers of chirashi advertising handbills, the proliferation of shogakai in the second quarter of the nineteenth cen- tury was responsible for quantities of commemorative publications. The Senmentei from 1814 periodically offered to the public registers of the principal participants at recent shogakai, their specialties, artistic sobriquets, and addresses.25 Ukiyo-e artists, themselves fre- quent celebrities at the gatherings, occasionally portrayed imag- inary shogakai scenes in their prints, or recorded, in an idealized 22 Heitei Ginkei, "Nanka no yume," p. 116.

Now monthly or even daily occurrences, the banquets taxed the capacities of the hosting facilities to the utmost. A collection of handbill announcements at- tests to 94 separate banquets between 1835 and 1843; a companion album offers evidence of some 172 additional shogakai between 1848 and 1860.27 Attendance on the shogakai "circuit," as a sponsor or supplementary celebrity, became an essential qualification for the would-be man about town.

What is more, he was a devotee of the tea ceremony, and had penetrated the inner mysteries of the Nanb6 School. His calligraphy he modeled on that of Sh6kad6 [Sh6j6]; his haikai poetry enjoyed esteem in the Edo School. While still in Edo he had mingled freely with literary figures of thunderous renown, and had been busy three hundred sixty days a year with a shogakai here, a "name inauguration" ban- quet there. He was a man of cultivated tastes, who lived for elegance the better part of every day.28 26 See, for example, the Kunisada diptych (?), "Shogakai no zu," reproduced in Kobayashi, "Edo jidai no shogakai," p. 167.

According to Bakin, between five and six hundred guests paid admission to attend a shogakai sponsored in part by the doyen of orthodox Chinese verse, Okubo Tenmin ;Wi? (1 767-1837); be- tween six and seven hundred thronged to honor Kameda B6sai at his shogakai (possibly the mammoth birthday celebration of 1823).29 Whatever the ideals of the gatherings, the sheer numbers of par- ticipants and the blatant commercial intentions of the organizers fostered a carnival atmosphere. For the "masters" in attendance, dignity was forfeit, while the public exchange of cash for an auto- graphed fan or the privilege of a few words of fawning adulation suggested to more than one observer a prostitution of celebrity. The rowdy feasting, the prominence of geisha, and the increasingly vestigial creative component of the occasions further reinforced the impression. Ota Kinj6 kiMWU (1765-1825), in a letter to his schol- arly colleague Okubo Tenmin in 1829, warns against the hidden perils of association with the shogakai set: According to recent report, calligraphers, painters, and seal-carvers of the city, regardless of their real proficiency in their arts, curry favor with your associates. Once they admit them to their ranks at the so-called shogakai banquets, they sidle close to them, and display the most fraternal degree of solicitude. At the right moments they applaud or reward their skills, in their desire to advertise their own names. And should any choose not to enter their cliques, they avert their faces, turn their glance aside, and consider him their sworn enemy. Most egregious in this regard are the circles of [Yamamoto] Ryokuin and [Okuyama] Kunpo. Their ostracism of men of true talent extends in all directions. This makes it impossible for me to be in attendance [?]. Their chief ambition is to coerce men of arts and let- ters to enter their snares. When these then stretch their wings, [the schemers] fling open their doors, and thus create panders for their traffic in fame, ambassadors in Edo-za or "Edo School" usually refers to the followers of Hattori Ransetsu (1654-1707) and Enomoto Kikaku (1661-1707), known for their shrewdness and urbanity. 29 Kyokutei, "Letter of Tenp6 7:10:26 to Tonomura J6sai" (see note 23 above), pp. 79- 80. Actually, Bakin transmits here the remarks of a tedai or "supervisory assistant" at the Manpachir6, who may be exaggerating to flatter his client. The proprietor of the Man- pachir6, however, is probably more reliable when he confides to Bakin that this gala is "the biggest in twenty years." On the B6sai extravaganza, in honor of the polymath's seventy- second birthday, see Addiss, The World of Kameda Bosai, p. 95; sources here note attendance figures of 800-900.</page><page sequence="13">EDO CELEBRITY BANQUETS 147 their quest for glory at any cost. Their scheming is sly; their machinations dire. How may we term this the conduct of gentlemen?30 Tenmin, the intended beneficiary of these admonitions, was how- ever himself one of the most enthusiastic participants in the functions in a relentless campaign to recruit new students for his burgeoning academy of Chinese verse in Kanda.3' Kitamura Nobuyo 4M+lfXi (1783-1856) excoriates Tenmin in the same breath with Kikuchi Gozan itPLU (1769?-1855), another opportunistic advocate of Chinese poetry for the masses: Recently [ca. 1830], shogakai gatherings have been conducted in various restau- rants and teahouses. They follow vigorously one after another, regardless of the season. The vulgarity of these occasions is no different from kouta song or joruri chanting recitals, "name inaugurations" for dancing girls, or flower arrangement gatherings "by invitation only." The Kikuchi Gozan and Okubo Tenmin crowd are preoccupied with these entertainments all year round.32 Kyokutei Bakin personifies the dilemma of the celebrity who wished to salvage both profit and pride from a shogakai in the 1830s. Though by every standard among the most successful authors the 30 As quoted from Shunsodo sha in Campbell, "Tenp6-ki zengo no shogakai, " p. 48; for full letter, see "Toka meiryii hindai ben," in Nihon jurin sosho, ed.

Kitamura continues his remarks with a discussion of the Senmentei (see note 19 above), and intimates that Gozan himself is one of the major organizers or agents for the functions. Mynmyokidan (Fantastic tales), a satirical kokkeibon com- posed around 1819 and published around 1828, is also quick to condemn the commercial eagerness of Gozan, Tenmin, and associates. In it, the ghosts of past worthies visit the dubious celebrities of modern times, and scold them for their follies-a framework probably revived by Heitei Ginkei in his Nanka noyume. Ota Kinj6 is accosted by the spirit of the Han scholar and archivist Liu Hsiang tIJrXJ (77-76 B.C.), who warns him that by publishing his Chinese poetry for profit, he is following the reprehensible example of the "poetry mer- chants" (shi-akindo) Tenmin and Gozan. Without vigorous reform, admonishes Liu Hsiang after supplying a nightmarish vision of celebrities in torment, Kinj6 is likely to fall in with the "shogakai set" and their relentless "hawking of celebrity and scrambling after profits" (baimei shari).

To attain his ambition, Bakin spon- sored perhaps the largest shogakai of all time at the Manpachir6 restaurant on September 24, 1836. Bakin's psychological resistance to almost every aspect of the preparations and to the day-long ordeal itself is to our advantage, since the author's detailed, martyred ac- counts, in letters and in his diary, contain our most precise record of the realities of the shogakai in its heyday." Preparations for the occasion began months in advance as Bakin, and later his deputized son-in-law, made the rounds of celebrities' homes, ukiyo-e paintings in hand as house gifts, to secure a comple- ment of glittering ancillary celebrities. Despite stormy weather the day before the event, public attendance exceeded all expectations, indeed all previous records. Meals for three hundred had been prepared, but the total number of paying guests surpassed seven hundred, while their attendants and the additional guests of honor raised the figure to more than eight hundred. Even the Man- pachir6, which featured almost two thousand square feet of floor space on two levels and several annexes, was unable to handle the press of humanity: every corner and corridor was occupied. In all, 1184 meals were served-many to guests who volunteered dubious meal-tickets, or who pilfered the delicacies. Three huge kegs of sake proved insufficient to the gargantuan feast, and by midday another half-keg had to be requisitioned. 3 The most comprehensive account is in Kyokutei, "Letter of Tenp6 7:10:26 to Tonomura J6sai" (see note 23 above), pp. 78-83. An excellent summary of the relevant passages appears in Leon M. Zolbrod, Takizawa Bakin (New York: Twayne Publishers, 1967), pp. 121-23. Also of value is Bakin's letter to J6sai of Tenp6 7:8:6/September 16, 1836, replete with uncertainties, misgivings, and last-minute jitters about the event just eight days away; see "Bakin no shogakai" in Nakamura Yukihiko chojutsu shu, 15 vols.

(Chui6k6ronsha, 1973), 4.293-94 (entry for Tenp6 7:8:14/September 24, 1836). The diary entry for the day shows every indication of exhaustion, and comments minimally on the banquet itself. More detailed remarks, Bakin notes, he has relegated to a separate notebook; the account he records here is abbreviated. An account from a participant's point of view is Iwamoto Sashichi :9t*AE- and Iwamoto Hiroshi :tZ*, "Gesaku rokka sen," Ensekijisshu (Kokusho kank6kai, 1907), 1.392-93.</page><page sequence="15">EDO CELEBRITY BANQUETS 149 The list of celebrities at Bakin's shogakai is a virtual inventory of every contemporary figure of note in the gamut of creative pursuits. Serious scholars like T-j6 Kindai (1795-1878) and Yashiro Hiro- kata (1758-1841) rubbed shoulders with rakugo comic raconteurs like Hayashiya Sh6z6 (1781-1842); academic painters like Kita Takekiyo (1776-1857) and Watanabe Kazan (1793-1841), ortho- dox calligraphers like Haruki Nanmei (1795-1878) encountered the stars of the ukiyo-e firmament, Utagawa Kunisada, Kuninao (1793-1854), Kuniyoshi (1797-1862), and Ikeda/Keisai Eisen (1790-1848). Okubo Tenmin and Kikuchi Gozan (by proxy) dined alongside the foremost names of popular gesaku fiction: Ryiitei Tanehiko (1783-1842), Bokusentei Yukimaro (1797-1856), and T6ri Sanjin (1790-1858). Even Tamenaga Shunsui (1790-1843), Bakin's literary rival and mortal enemy, made an appearance, though Sant6 Ky6zan, still mindful of Bakin's callousness to his brother Ky6den, declined the invitation. Representatives of the rusui JVqJ&amp; corps, the absentee "caretakers" of Edo Castle, made an appearance, as did several ladies-in-waiting from the women's quarters of the castle, emissaries of their mistresses' esteem. The serious and popular publishers of Edo attended to a man; each "brigade" of kashihon ya commercial book lenders (among the prin- cipal beneficiaries from Bakin's lengthy yomihon romances) sent a representative. Even paper wholesalers, who owed some of their pros- perity to Bakin's unprecedented national success, made a show- ing.34 The nine-hour extravaganza taxed Bakin's forces to the limit, but his trials were not at an end with the dispersal of the guests: for two or three days more, Bakin labored to autograph the mountain of fans, silk squares, paintings, and assorted memorabilia his admirers had laid before him. The gross revenue, Bakin notes meticulously in a letter of December 1836, exceeded 110 ryo, but expenses con- sumed the greater Dart of the amount.35 Rice alone cost a good three 34 Kyokutei, "Letter of Tenp6 7:10:26 to TonomuraJ6sai" (see note 23 above), pp. 80-82 methodically lists the celebrities by categories.

As a rough estimate, if there were 800 paying guests, then the per capita revenue was about 2.2 shu. Bakin's goal was closer to two hundred ryo, and soon after the banquet, he began the</page><page sequence="16">150 ANDREW MARKUS ryo, and the souvenir "favors," in such quantities, were far more burdensome than anticipated. When all was said and done, Bakin's net gain was only in the vicinity of forty ryo-still far short of the sum required for his objectives. The drain on his energies, the loss of time that might more profitably have been invested in writing made even these gains seem bitter indeed. Fewer anecdotes or satirical depictions trace the progress of the shogakai after its high-water mark in the 1830s. Most colorful perhaps is the scene at a shogakai conducted in 1853 by the kyJka master Umenoya Matsu6 fWRU (1804-1865). As the banquet at the Kawachiya in Yanagibashi reached its boisterous peak, Utagawa Kuniyoshi, near sixty but spry as ever, entertained the gathering by sketching a gigantic likeness of a bandit-hero from the chapters of Shui hu chuan on a room-sized piece of oiled paper. When brushes proved insufficient to the task, he tore off his clothing, drenched it in the pigments, and completed the cartoon.36 The increasing poverty of the disentitled samurai class after the Meiji Restoration, and the indigence of the artists who had relied on them as patrons and disciples led to an upsurge of the shogakai in the 1870s. Yanagibashi remained as ever a center for the gatherings, a bastion of the "old regime" in oppositicn to the preferred resorts of the new civil bureaucracy in Shinbashi. Narushima Ryuihoku 0MV0 AL (1837-1884) alludes to the continuity of the shogakai institution in his Ryuikyo shinshi J (New notes from Yanagibashi, 1874), though the functions evidently had lost some of their former luster: recently, we learn from the gossip of two rough-and-tumble youths in the work, a pretentious geisha, "Granny" Fusahachi, had ini- tiated her own profitable shogakai at the Nakamuraya.37 The institu- painful task of selling off his library; see Sugiura Minpei fMM , Ka-Sei Tenpo no bunjin (Nippon h6s6 shuppan ky6kai, 1977), p. 41. 36 Sait6, BukJ nenpy5, 2.135. The exact size of the paper was thirty jo, approximately 540 square feet. The Shui hu chuan hero in question was the heavily tattooed Chiu-wen-lung ("Nine Tattooed Dragons") Shih Chin-possibly a reproduction by request of one of Kuniyoshi's early great ukiyo-e successes.

The empty pomp of the gatherings, the crass cupidity of the organizers, the hypocrisy of the "celebrities" and dearth of gen- uine creativity-all were fitting themes for the satirist's deflating pinpricks. The common participants at the shogakai, significantly, rarely figure prominently in these critical depictions: the primary victims are the pompous organizers and their celebrity cohorts, who indeed must have constituted the target readership of these special- ized lampoons. There is little attempt to extend the perimeters of the satire to the literary or artistic world as a whole, or to view the shogakai as a microcosm of society at large; external events are entire- ly extraneous. The chroniclers express no disapproval, one notes, for the extravagance of the banquets conducted during the height of the Tenp6 Famine in 1833-1836-a contrast of penury and super- abundance that cannot have escaped general notice.39 Already during its earlier phases, the shogakai fostered readily recognizable "types." Two years before his own shogakai, Shikitei Sanba had portrayed one such in his broad depiction of Takuan, an In the introductory pages of Ryukyo shinshi, Ryuihoku enumerates leading restaurants of the Yanagibashi area. The Manpachir6, Kawachiya, and Nakamuraya, he notes, are celebrated for their rental facilities, in which calligraphers conduct shogakai, the wealthy hold their ban- quets, and instructors of dance, shamisen, and flower-arranging stage their recitals or public exhibitions; see Narushima, "Ryuky6 shinshi, " p. 192. 38 Iwaya [=Oe] Sazanami W (kII1) 'N0, "T6 de shind6, " in Tosei shonen katagi (1892; reprint Harupu shuppan, 1975), pp. 16-31. The " Wunderkind at age ten" of the title is ex- hibited by his proud father at shogakai in the Nakamuraya. A member of the House of Peers, observing a command performance, sternly berates the doting father for crippling his son's development, and in the end, presents the boy with a copy of Seiyo risshi hen (Instances of deter- mination in the West, 1871)-Nakamura Masanao's ttIVER (1832-1891) adaptation of Samuel Smiles's inspirational compendium of self-made men, Self-help (1859). 39 Bakin, far from feeling compunction at the timing of his banquet, openly congratulates himself that it occurred when it did: only a few days after his shogakai, rice prices rose sharply from 20 to 25 mon per go, as a result of metropolitan relief measures for starving refugees; Kyokutei, "Letter of Tenp6 7:10:26 to Tonomura J6sai" (see note 23 above), p. 83.</page><page sequence="18">152 ANDREW MARKUS archly sesquipedalian physician of dubious credentials who fre- quents the "bathhouse of the floating world" in Ukiyo-buro. Among the agenda in his hectic schedule of dilettantish clubs and diver- sions, Takuan announces his imminent departure for a shogakai.0 The figure of the jaded, overly sought-after secondary celebrity, a professional fixture for all cultural occasions, animates one of the rambling monologues in Kanagaki Robun's 1 (1829-1894) album of early Meiji types, [Gyiiten zatsudan] Aguranabe t-FX*A 1Qfi A (Beef-shop small talk: Cross-legged around the stew-pot; 1871- 1872).

His apparel, in fact, is not all that discreditable, but he makes a point of wearing, to no very good effect, the top and bottom of his ensemble mismatched, to demonstrate that he has seen through the world and its tiresome pretensions. He ties his black haori jacket high on his chest with a thick purple cord. Equally prominent are his lofty self-esteem and superior pose. At his side lie rolls of Chinese rice paper, bundles of folding fans, wrapped up in a carrying-cloth of American calico. In the background hovers the pungent aroma of sake-and one wonders if this might represent the aftermath of a gathering at the Nakamuraya or Manpachiro, somewhere in the vicinity. His companions look like ordinary sorts of fellows, coaxed along. ([The reader] must imagine that, from time to time, retorts and exclamations will accompany [the monologue].) "My dears, I am absolutely exhausted after today's shogakai. There I was, con- fronted on every side with rice paper, Chinese fans-instruments of pure torture! Even your humble servant succumbed to despair. But isn't that always how these things are, after all. And you know, I had made up my mind. No matter how much they entreat me, I told myself, I simply will not go to another shogakai. Just give them a little token gift and be done with it.

Seiken, frustrated by accidents of birth and the volatile politics of his native Mito fief, found no worthy employment for his considerable erudition in the Chinese classics. Resigned to a marginal existence as a "useless man" and petty schoolmaster, Seiken, not surprisingly, cast a jaundiced eye on the self-congratulatory bonhomie of shogakai gatherings. One anecdote records that the author hung before his gates a sign flatly refusing, in no uncertain terms, any participation in the functions.42 The ascendancy of the shogakai, like the new splendor of the kabuki theaters, the sumo arena, and the licensed prostitution quarters, was for Seiken a clear manifestation of the unparalleled prosperity Meiji kaika-ki bungaku sha, Nihon kindai bungaku taikei (1970), 1.65-66. The monologue is the sixth and final one in the first chapter. The majority of proper names in the presentation are recognizable figures. Haruki Nanko (1759-1839) and Haruki Nanmei (1795-1878; seventy-seven years old in 1871) won renown for evocative nanga painting and floral depictions. Okitsu Kaname, the modern editor of Aguranabe, laboriously identifies each name in the speaker's catalogue of celebrities. Among them figure kanshi poets (Onuma Chinzan, Suzuki Sh6t6, Uemura Roshui), calligraphers (Seki Sekk6, Hattori Zuian, Hattori Hazan), painters (Inose T6nei, Ozaki Han'u, Araki Keishil). The "fancy types" in the kitchen include Hagiwara Otohiko/Umebori Kokuga II (1826-1886), a minor writer whose career moved from late ninjobon to early journalism. Ma- tsumoto Fuiko (1840-1923), a conservative in the world of Meiji Nihon-ga painting, later became a member of the Nihon Bijutsuin academy in collaboration with Hashimoto Gaho (1835-1908) and Okakura Tenshin (1862-1913). The proposed trip upstream is possibly toward the Yoshiwara district, possibly toward the restaurants in the vicinity of Muk6jima. The reference to "governor of quite a large fief' (taihan no chiji-ko) places this conversation prior to the abolition of han fiefs and the institution of prefectures in August 1871-January 1872. It is not clear whether Robun himself was an habitue of the shogakai "circuit," but his name does appear on the long roster of guests in Ginkei's fictional shogakai of 1861; see Heitei Ginkei, "Tsutakazura koi no hanabishi, " in Ninjobon kessaku shu (II), ed.

Though I myself have not enjoyed an opportunity to join these associations, yet I have, on several occasions, been among the lesser guests, and have observed enough to know in some detail the nature of their activities.43 The allusions, to the Mencius, typify the subtlety of the author's irony. The reputation of the superior man is like water: it rises and falls in direct proportion to the level of its source, and surges to "swell the irrigation channels" when its virtue is most abundant. While the metaphor at first glance appears consistent with Seiken's words of praise, readers who shared the author's expertise in the Confucian canon would appreciate the barb hidden in the allusion: this same passage concludes with the philosopher's insistence that the superior man must be ashamed of a reputation that exceeds his true deserts.44 "Billowing clouds" and "drenching rains" figure in a moving parable of the virtue of a benevolent ruler, who revives the parched fields and evokes at once gratitude and obedience. Far from the charismatic sage kings Mencius has in mind, however, are the perpetrators of the shogakai, who coerce and dupe their cohorts with a hollow reputation.43 While true talent, like the authority of a benevolent monarch, needs no gaudv show to attract adherents. the fame of the shogakai 43 Terakado, Edo hanjoki, 1.96.

Several months prior to the actual ban- quet, [the sponsors] determine an auspicious date, then hoist aloft a great billboard to proclaim: "A banquet will be held such-and-such day of such-and-such month, regardless of weather conditions. We respectfully solicit the presence of gentlemen from all quarters." The notice lists, moreover, in bold script the full names of the masters [scheduled to attend]. Perhaps this is to ensure that none will fail to recognize them as proper sensei. In my humble opinion, it is rather like the an- nouncement boards of the Han court, that published of old successful examination results. Spectators crowd around it, grinding shoulders together, trampling one another's heels. They point to each name in turn and declare: "That one is an art- ist, that one a poet, he is a Confucian scholar, that other is a calligrapher, and he is holding his 'name inauguration' as a master of flower arranging. This one is a lady of the Shimizu family-her first appearance at a banquet. " Lingering on the spot, they stare agog at the billboard, like crowds scanning the placards above the heads at the execution grounds. Before the actual banquet, the host rises at cockcrow, and busies himself rushing about [to invite illustrious guests]. Among the "great and lofty," none does not "rush forth," nor does the host fear succumbing to "internal fever" from his exer- 46 tions. Seiken scrutinizes the smug demeanor of his prosperous contem- poraries at the banquet with a mixture of envy and revulsion. The host's earlier scramble for influential guests contrasts sharply with his immediate gravity and imperturbability. For all their solemn pretensions, however, he and his colleagues are no better than sideshow curiosities in the eyes of a gawking public: 46 Terakado, Edo hanjfki, 1.96-98. The identity of the "Shimizu family" member is not clear. Taketani Chojir6 t iiiI=j1, in his modern-language rendition, assumes that the passage refers to a female reciter of the Kiyomoto school of shamisen recitative. See Terakado Seiken, Edo hanj5ki, ed. and trans. Taketani Chojir6 (Ky6ikusha, 1980), 1.82. It seems more probable to me, however, that the lady in question is the novice calligraphy instructor who ap- pears later in the passage. The phrases "great and lofty" and "internal fever" allude to ch. 19 (Ta-sheng) of Chuang Tzu. In the cautionary parable recited by a humble janitor, a certain unenlightened Chang Yi exhausts himself currying favor with those of high estate, and suc- cumbs after forty years of this pointless frenzy to an "internal fever."

Behind the dais stand a railing and desks, where two accountants, reserve brushes in their hair, keep the books. Guest and host exchange cordial greetings-not unlike patrons saluting their pawnbroker at New Year's. There are attendants to care for the guests' swords, and police for the provisions; sake stewards and tea factotums stand in smart array at their posts. The guests enter little by little, [at first] like huddled fawns. The host welcomes now this one, acknowledges now that one. There is nary a moment for him to decline the congratulatory gifts of cash they lay before him-and how much less leisure does he enjoy for the exchange of cups. The guests in pairs toast the health of their host, press drink on one another. Several renowned geisha have been summoned, to attend the honored guests and proffer them sake. Jests and merry jibes reign everywhere, and even if there is no music to liven the occasion, laughter and the gladsome cup suffice to bring on tipsy hilarity. A geisha discovers her special favorite in the rollicksome crowd-even as "Red Whisk" discovered her Master Li [Ching]-while a latter-day Chou Yi launches into drunken invective [that he will regret on the morrow]. Scarlet carpets divide the hall; the august masters occupy them in turn. A blur of the brush, and dragons hurtle across the page; beneath the tip of the brush a phoenix soars. A genius possesses the artists' breasts; a daemon lodges in their fingertips. Ten thousand gold pieces would be a paltry price for one line of their calligraphy; a diminutive album becomes an heirloom for a thousand years. The spectators disburse their lucre, while vying to implore [yet another specimen]. The assembly becomes a sea of grasping fingers. Alluring in comely fard and fair attire is a female sensei-of late so much in vogue. In delicate hands she manipulates her brush, or strikes a pose, brush poised to her lip. Her person so resplendent, her brushwork nigh divine-a horde of guests surrounds her, envelops her like ants or flies. The more she declines their re- quests, the more importunately they beg. Her stern instructors at her side look on intently, concerned: though she is faithful to their injunctions not to go beyond their teachings, they are powerless to curb this [unexpected surge] of transactions. The wine flows; the mountains of viands crumble. The din is thunderous; dust boils up in great clouds. There remains not even an inch to spare in the banquet hall of a thousand mats. The host still craves, however, to augment this sea of par- ticipants, be it only by a few more [paying] droplets. The bustle slowly slackens, and the hour approaches to light the lanterns in the establishment. The staff pro- claims for all to hear: "We do not allow overnight sojourns. " The drunken guests reluctantly rise to take their leave.47 4 Terakado, Edo hanjoki, 1.99-100. The greetings of the pawnbroker and his regular clientele at New Year's would presumably be strained, since the pawnbroker would know only too well the source of the funds his clients had used to obtain their holiday finery and pay off creditors.

Cyril Birch (New York: Grove Press, 1965), pp. 314-22. Chou Yi ,l1 (269-322) is the subject of numerous anecdotes that illustrate his forthright repartee as well as his fondness for wine. The reference here may be to an apocryphal episode in which Chou Yi, somewhat in his cups, reproached Emperor Ming of the Eastern Chin (ruled 323-325) for the emperor's presump- tuous remarks that ministers currently in attendance might be compared to the sage kings Yao or Shun, and as a result, incurred near-fatal displeasure. See Liu I-ch'ing VA0, A New Account of Tales of the World [Shih-shuo hsin-yii], trans. Richard B. Mather (Minneapolis: Uni- versity of Minnesota Press, 1976), p. 165 (section 5.30). The conclusion of the passage describing the female sensei is difficult to interpret, though clearly her mentors are displaying some anxiety at being eclipsed by their pupil. Following this passage is a long poem by a certain Master Sh6k6 (pp. 101-4), which alter- nately praises and mocks the gatherings. At the shogakai, Sh6k6 observes: [Guests] cluster dense as quills on a hedgehog, collect like flies, swarm like ants. What mind they if the winds rage, the rains pelt down? Infinite their pains to suck carbuncles or lick hemorrhoids [in obsequious service]. ... (p. 102) Sh6k6's long-winded outburst is followed by a quatrain by the author's friend, Ri Kei, who offers an ironic defense of the scholars' mendicity by pointing out the importance of alms and begging to the perpetuation of Buddhism (p. 104). The section concludes with a mention of rosters published by the Senmentei (p. 108; see note 25 above). 4 The work bears a postscript of the Ninth Month of Tenp6 4, i.e., October-November 1833 by Hakushukuen Shujin (=Abe Rekisai) (p. 399), and Ginkei sets the action of the work in the Ninth Month of 1833 (p. 365). Publication, however, occurred in 1835, after the author's one-year sojourn in Osaka. A brief autobiography of Ginkei appears in the work itself (pp. 368-69). Another autobiographical sketch, from [Kinsei meika] Bunjin anasagashi (Hunting for foibles of modern literati, ca. 1836), appears in Campbell, "Tenp6-ki zengo no shogakai," p. 65. 4 One of Ginkei's earliest published works, Shoga waisui (Flourishing cluster of painting and calligraphy; 1832, installments through 1860), seems to belong to this category of direc- tory. According to Myjmj gidan (see note 42 above), Ginkei was open to bribes for a favorable placement on his banzuke listings. Quoted in Maruyama, Kaidai introduction, Seiken chidan;</page><page sequence="25">EDO CELEBRITY BANQUETS 159 Ginkei consorted familiarly with an unusually wide circle of ac- quaintances, both in Edo and in Osaka. By the early 1830s, he had initiated a series of monthly shogakai gatherings on a small salon scale in his Edo residence. His intimate knowledge of the institution and its primary figures was ample license for a playful depiction of its shortcomings. The choice of subject may owe something to a reading of Edo hanjJki-a work Ginkei mentions with respect in his Chimata no uwasa, and whose reputation, he claims in Nanka noyume, has extended to the spirit world.50 As Nanka no yume opens, Ginkei the first-person narrator heads toward Ry6goku Bridge to attend a shogakai sponsored by an associate. Upon crossing the threshold, he finds the event in full swing: Already my acquaintances there were in high spirits, utterly absorbed in w-tching the geisha refill their cups. Brush-pouches lay idle in their laps, while no one much noticed when fans were soaked by spilled sake. "Another cup! " "One more here!" they cried. "Have another one, friend" and "I couldn't possibly" and "One more down the hatch!"-the cultivated metamorphosed into the uncouth!51 The afternoon draws on, but the bibulous hilarity of the gathering is far from abating. The reception area, where guests purchase their admission, assumes a character anything but dignified: The hubbub around the till suggested a booth for lottery tickets; the caterers in their stiff kataginu vests looked just like barkers at a temple fair. Sword-checkers tagged each item entrusted to them, so there could be no confusion, while the sake supervisor detected all intruders with his darting glance. The host buried himself in the inventory [of guests?] handed to him, while waiters dashed upstairs, their eyes fixed on the second floor. An artist needed only to take brush in hand for spectators to crane their necks and observe him; a geisha needed only to pour a cup for a literatus to drool and drain it. Chief among the benefactors were not the elegant patrons; here common guests were the masters, and men of elegance merely their attendants.52 Kansan yoroku; . . ., p. xi.

Obediently, Ginkei staggers downstairs, only to find himself the defendant before a fantastic nightmare tribunal of mon- sters, goblins, and weirdly anthropomorphic kitchen utensils. Pre- siding over this court is a hideous apparition with long hair, horns, and vicious fangs protruding to the chin. When, incredulous, Ginkei asks the reason for this extraordinary session, he learns that he must answer for the excesses of his wretched fellow creatures, many of whom have usurped the monsters' prerogative of rapid deceptive transformation, and have themselves become bakemono IL (ir) e (literally, "change creatures"), phantoms of a new sort. These human bakemono, the judge rebukes him, exceed their super- natural models in the wiliness of their disguises, and preside with undetected impunity over the now ubiquitous shogakai: ". . . Accordingly I despatched my loyal follower, the wild fox-himself an old hand at transformations-and had him investigate the situation. Yes, it was just as I had imagined: a shogakai here, another shogakai over there-shogakai assaulting the senses in every direction. Ac.cording to the report submitted by friend fox, the human bakemono abound at these gatherings. With my powers of clairvoyance, I scanned these meetings from afar, and found things precisely as the fox had told us. A motley rabble of the most varied description had bake-fied themselves into literati and were duping the commoners, attending alongside authentic masters of arts and letters. To all appearances, they were the genuine article-a sign they already had begun to encroach upon our path [of perfect deceptive transformation]. What is more, Confucian doctors of haughty mien and arrayed in stiff kataginu vests were engrossed in drinking and trivial party games, in dandling the geisha. These we might call scholar-bakemono, who have turned their backs on the way of Confucius. When bakemono monsters like these run rampant in the world, our own vocation presently will suffer a sharp decline, and the hour cannot be far removed when this [phantom] world of ours will be usurped by humans...."53 The presiding demon allows Ginkei no chance to speak on his own behalf, but launches into an exposition of his typically shaky credentials as a bunjin literatus. How can he, thunders the in- quisitor, claim to be an expert calligrapher, when the limit of his commissions to date has been inscribing the covers of six petty cash benefactors (danna), while the "men of elegance" (gajin) are reduced to the function of at- tendant (0-tomo). 53 Heitei, "Nanka no yume," p. 368.</page><page sequence="27">EDO CELEBRITY BANQUETS 161 ledgers, and the occasional request from a nagaya tenement block for a "No Pissing Here" sign? How is it that, despite his superlative early education, he has fallen to become the companion of kyoka poetasters and gesaku scribblers? Shocking, too, continues the judge, is Ginkei's behavior at shogakai, where he generates execrable poetry and calligraphy with blithe abandon, and expends more time on the criticism of the geishas' looks and merits of the sake than on any literary performances. In this he exemplifies all too faithfully the spirit of the modern shogakai-functions perhaps more worthy of the epithets geishakai "geisha gatherings" or shugakai fiSt "alcoholic elegance parties."" At this juncture, the fictional element of Nanka noyume begins to disintegrate rapidly, as the author, through the opinions of the monster judge, begins a lengthy harangue against the ignorance of modern "authorities." Modern calligraphers are no longer able to sign paintings correctly; they misuse their artistic sobriquets on per- sonal seals; they consistently commit gross solecisms in the or- thography and grammar of their compositions; they bestow the honorific title sensei on all and sundry; they misinterpret lines from plays and common proverbs. No infraction is too petty to escape the censure of the long-winded demon. At the conclusion of his tirade-a good two-thirds of the entire work-the stern judge acknowledges that Ginkei is still not entirely beyond redemption; despite his affectations, he is still in the earlier stages of metamorphosis, one foot in the world of men and the other in the world of the bakemono phantoms, and merits clemency as a borderline case. Before dismissing him, however, the court exacts Ginkei's solemn promise that, at future shogakai, he will adhere strictly to the paths of elegance, and waste no time debating gastronomic niceties; he will attend with brushes, seal, and ver- milion pad at the ready for earnest production; he will revere all masters of the arts in attendance, without himself affecting airs; he will not attempt to obtain additional meal-tickets from his hosts under false Dretenses. or stay bevond the late afternoon for 5 Heitei, "Nanka no yume," p. 374. Compare the play on words in Terakado, Edo han- jjki, 3.94, in which an abusive drunken student claims that contemporary shikai "poetry gatherings" are now nothing more than shukai "drinking parties," while shukai "drinking parties" have degenerated into shukai "parties for gathering shu [coins]."</page><page sequence="28">162 ANDREW MARKUS ". . . Lingering too long inconveniences the host, nor do the caterers and account- ants look very kindly on the practice. The host suffers most, however, for at dusk he begins his mental calculations. As he flips back and forth through the ledger of receipts, he behaves for all the world like a convict scanning a letter of amnesty on Demon Island. At this stage, the guests should exercise tact, and expedite their departure. . . A goblin minion snatches the penitent Ginkei by the scruff of his neck, and pitches him headlong into the Sumida beside Ry6goku Bridge. With a shriek, the author awakens, only to realize that he is secure in his own study. The banquet and trial had all been, like the vision of the "prefect of Nan-k'e" of old, the dream of a moment, prompted by dozing off at his desk with a shogakai publicity handbill pressed to his forehead.56 Though typically labeled a comic kokkeibon, Nanka no yume fits uneasily at best into any ready conventional category. Its initial and final pages are indeed light and fancifully grotesque, but it is difficult to imagine that the demon's pettifogging complaints about the improper placement of a cyclical date in an artist's inscription on his finished work, or the dire consequences of the misuse of ver- bal auxiliaries in kyJka poems would occasion much hilarity among the public in general. Is it possible that Nanka no yume was dis- tributed as a door gift of sorts to banquet patrons of the 1830s, or as a novelty gift at Ginkei's domestic shogakai? The three fron- tispieces by Utagawa Sadahiro/Hirosada tJIIAY CA (ca. 1810- 1864), which depict in composite portrait fifty celebrities from the 5 Heitei, "Nanka no yume," p. 397. The mention of "amnesty letter" and "Demon Is- land" (Kikai-ga-shima) immediately evokes the tragic fate of Bishop Shunkan. Apprehended for plotting the overthrow of the Taira in 1 177, Shunkan and two confederates were banished to the remote penal islet off Kyushu. While his two companions eventually won release in a general amnesty of 1178, Shunkan alone remained unpardoned, and died in exile. Ginkei hints that the shogakai host will suffer grave disappointment upon reviewing the account books. 56 The judge also enjoins Ginkei not to shunt the burden of composing publicity handbills to others-a task which perhaps inspired the work in the first place; Heitei, "Nanka no yume," p. 397. A "Nan-k'e dream" was apparently a proverbial expression for any empty fantasy or daydream. The origin of the expression lies in the T'ang novella Nan-k'e t'ai-shou chuan WtJ t&amp;Fi (Account of the prefect of "South Branch") by Li Kung-tso (ca. 775-850). Apart from the fact that both narratives center around a cautionary drunken dream, experienced by a young man in his prime, there seems to be little connection between Ginkei's piece and the T'ang account.</page><page sequence="29">EDO CELEBRITY BANQUETS 163 worlds of scholarship, the kabuki theater, arts, and letters at one of Ginkei's monthly meetings, suggest that Nanka no yume originated as a "collectible" or souvenir item rather than as a comic work for profitable mass circulation.57 Almost thirty years later, Ginkei returned to the shogakai as a set- ting for his Tsutakazura koi no hanabishi X,*,Zl;-tA. (Vines and ivy love's scallop lozenge crest, 1861 ?).58 Like Nanka no yume, Tsuta- kazura is a work difficult to classify in any standard category of fic- tional production. Its cover, preface, and general external format proclaim it a ninjobon romantic novelette-a genre well past its hey- day in the 1860s, but still recognizable. The perfunctory quality of the fictional elements, which dissolve regularly to allow the author's niggling denunciations full rein, suggests that Tsutakazura, like Nanka noyume, was not a commercial venture so much as a diversion for an appreciative coterie. As the work begins, Kiseki, an elegant young retainer to the Uesugi clan in Kamakura, has suffered an unpardonable disgrace by allowing a specimen of Sugawara no Michizane's (845-903) own brushwork, vouchsafed him by his lord, to fall into a robber's hands. Despairing, Kiseki prepares for self-destruction, but accepts instead the advice of a young colleague, who persuades him that such a death would be to no purpose: he will better serve his lord by conducting a search for the missing treasure. To this end, Kiseki makes his way to Edo, where he lives off sales of his ukiyo-e artwork, 5 See frontispieces by Sadahiro/Hirosada reproduced in Heitei, "Nanka no yume," pp. 358-64. Very similar in style, disposition of figures, and identifying cartouches are the fron- tispieces designed by Keisai Eisen around 1836 for Edo meibutsu shi; see Ozaki, "H6gai D6jin- cho no Edo meibutsu shi, " pp. 225-26. On the artist and his profitable association with Ginkei, see Roger S. Keyes, "Hirosada: Osaka Print Designer," in Hirosada: Osaka Printmaker, ed. Jane K. Bledsoe (Long Beach, Calif.: University Art Museum, California State University, Long Beach, 1984), pp. 8-25, especially p. 9. 58 The text of Heitei Ginkei, "Tsutakazura koi no hanabishi, " in Ninjobon kessaku sha (II), ed. Ohashi Shintar6, Teikoku bunko, 34 (Hakubunkan, 1895), pp. 281-304 is apparently se- verely cropped, at beginning and end, though there is no indication of abridgment in the text or editor's preface. A description of the full work, derived from the original edition, appears in Ozaki Kyuiya, "Ginkei-saku no myo na ninj6bon," Edo bungaku kenkya, 33 (1930): 181-89. A date of 1861 seems justified by several internal topical allusions. O-Suzu mentions her loss of both parents in "the recent earthquake" (p. 295)-most probably the Ansei Earth- quake of November 1855; Kiseki berates robbers by insisting that the current high level of inflation is no excuse for pursuing a life of crime (p. 303); and O-Suzu encounters Kiseki for the first time at a hokku gathering in Shitaya in the spring of 1861 (p. 296).</page><page sequence="30">164 ANDREW MARKUS and haunts the rounds of the shogakai in hopes of intelligence. At a particularly lavish banquet in late spring, attended by over two hun- dred guests (all of them listed by name), Kiseki encounters among the geisha a certain O-Suzu, with whom he had spent moments of heady passion at a haikai poetry gathering two months earlier. Another young woman, 0-Fusa, is among those who request a sam- ple of Kiseki's painting skills at the gathering, though she is ab- ducted by brigands immediately after the banquet adjourns. Some time later, O-Suzu calls on Kiseki in his study, and tearfully an- nounces she has been selected as a bride by a loathsome dissipated playboy. Rather than face a life of intolerable separation, the two vow to commit shinjzu double love suicide-though at this point, the maid jostles Kiseki awake from his slumber, and the protagonist realizes, like Ginkei in Nanka noyume, that O-Suzu's visit had been only a dream. On this inconclusive note, Tsutakazura draws to a close. The ninjobon elements-a feckless, morbidly attractive hero, his entourage of self-sacrificing feminine admirers-are clearly a flimsy scaffolding for the central purpose of the work: the transcription of interaction and conversation in sociable cultural gatherings. The haikai meeting of the first book, the shogakai of the second, and the shoga-ichi -iiA, an art auction through sealed bids that Kiseki at- tends before O-Suzu's distressing visit in the final book of Tsuta- kazura, are perhaps the closest we have to actual records of the exchange typical at these specialized functions. One's expectations soar-but in fact the level of interaction is distressingly banal, more reminiscent of small talk at a lackluster reception or lethargic con- vention than the electric congress of great spirits. Kiseki's opening conversation with his companion Hakusai (probably intended to represent Ginkei's close personal friend, the botanist Abe Rekisai, 1805-1870), centers first around the wretchedness of shogakai fare: Kiseki: K6bun [ =the caterer, K6bundo]! One main course here, please. I'm sorry, but this fish-salad is quite inedible. I'd much rather have some sashimi or broth instead. Hakusai: You're so right. For appetizers it's not unusual to get a fish-salad vinaigrette, or maybe boiled fish. They don't even bother with broth these days. Baikei: Mm. They've picked up some bad habits. It used to be you'd give</page><page sequence="31">EDO CELEBRITY BANQUETS 165 them two meal-tickets, and you'd get a big "bumper platter," but they stopped that-must have been around the end of K6ka [ =late 1840s]. Jutsud6: True, true. And the soup-dumpling soup, you could count on it every time. But now they don't even serve you that any more. ...59 Kiseki's spontaneous artistic outpourings for the occasion- sketches of "a pretty geisha" or "hopping sparrows" -do not sug- gest an exalted level of creative effort.60 Sallies of verbal wit during much of the shogakai, equally, soar no higher than salacious badi- nage with participating geisha. Even when the conversation takes a more literary turn, the topics under discussion are the latest comic punning distortions of popular saws and proverbs, or a word game popular in senryui groups, which entails providing a humorous twelve-syllable sequel or preface to a given five-syllable line. Not sur- prisingly, the guests have nothing but praise for the productions of Ginkei: Kakusai: ... You know, in our group, just before New Year's last year, "add- ing twelves" was all the rage. The last line was nasake nari [mercy in- deed], and someone from the neighborhood came up with: Neko ni shite Sent her for a geisha- oita wa haha no mother's nasake nari mercy indeed! He won the prize, hands down! Ryudh6: Yes, of course. "Sent her for a geisha" -splendid! A year or two ago, there was that same last line, and someone added: Nasake naki Stern lessons of shi no ky6kun mo the merciless teacher- nasake nari mercy indeed! Another prizewinner!

Rinsai: I see, I see: Achikochi ni Here and there zenmai nokoru ferns left over Shuy6zan on Mt. Shou-yang ... warabi wa kina (They polished off the last kuitsukushitari of the bracken yesterday.) Penetrating wit!61 The ignorance of current "authorities" -and sole reliability of Ginkei's opinions-becomes a wearisome refrain, in Tsutakazura no less than Nanka no yume. Ginkei the guest, upon arriving at the fictional shogakai, immediately begins criticizing the careless, incor- rectly alphabetized celebrity directories published by the caterer. At the shoga-ichi auction, a bidder cites Ginkei's expertise in determin- ing the authenticity of a poem-card attributed to It6 Jinsai (1627- 1705). Through the same bidder, Ginkei the author hurls invective against a preposterous published ranking of cultural figures, past and present, while two samurai on a stroll, further mouthpieces for the author, critically dissect an erroneous opinion of a verse by Minamoto no Sanetomo (1 192-1219).62 Ginkei's continuous self- 61 Heitei, "Tsutakazura koi no hanabishi," p. 287. The word game in the original bears the title go-moji-zuke, "adding on to a five-syllable [line]. " The humor of the senryiu verse, ex- panded into a full kyjka, lies in the irreverent treatment of the two Confucian paragons, Po Yi and Shu Ch'i. Reluctant to "eat the grain of Chou," i.e., to recognize the legitimacy of Chou rule, the brothers retired to Mt. Shou-yang in Shansi, where starvation soon ensued. (See Ssu-ma Ch'ien, Records of the Historian: Chapters from the Shih chi of Ssu-ma Ch'ien, trans. Burton Watson (New York: Columbia University Press, 1958), pp. 11-15.) The senryu7 sug- gests that starvation might in fact have seemed preferable to their unpalatable diet of ferns or bracken, while the addition by Kominoan deflates the dignity of the two still further by introducing the highly ungenteel verb kuitsukusu "gobble all up, wolf down." 62 Criticism of improperly alphabetized registry in Heitei, "Tsutakazura koi no hanabishi, " pp. 290-91; attack on ignorant criticism of Sanetomo poem on p. 300.

The shogakai, in conclusion, flourished as a forum for the periodic interaction, however shallow, of a wide variety of creative figures throughout the early nineteenth century. Under the same roof, and possibly at the same table, assembled the leading figures of diverse media, quarreling schools, and representatives of the most ex- clusive, as well as the most popular artistic traditions. The vanity and cupidity of the sponsors, the boorishness of the paying par- ticipants, and the disparity between trumpeted ideals and abrasive realities alarmed or amused contemporaries, who saw little of merit in the ostentatious displays. Without more explicit documentation to the contrary, it would be difficult, in fact, to insist that the level of intellectual or artistic exchange at the banquets was on a very heady plane. The substance of the exchange, however, may not have been as significant as the symbolic value of the phenomenon: the im- mediate confrontation of the artist with his peers and public in all their bewildering variety. For the common participant, the shogakai promised the blandishments of immediate elevation to a cultural elite in exchange for a modest fee. The benefits to the sponsor and celebrities, other than fiscal, are harder to define, though the robust vitality of the institution suggests that creativity, whatever its level of sophistication, now required a dual cachet of popular no less than peer recognition as an unequivocal validation of success.</page></plain_text>
