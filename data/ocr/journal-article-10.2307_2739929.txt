<plain_text><page sequence="1">On the Essential Morphological Basis for Human Culture by Z. FRANKENSERGER Prague, Czechoslovakia. 28 vi 63 I have read with great interest the article by A. L. Bryan, "The Essential Morphological Basis for Human Cul- ture'' (CA 4:297), as well as the com- ments. The chief question is not whether higher primates are, or are not, able to produce vowels and con- sonants of human speech, but whether they can build general notions from individual experience. Sounds are not necessary to build general notions as deaf and dumb mutes do it with finger language. Then, the question becomes, not whether the highest non- human primates are able to learn vowels and words from man, but whether they are able to build the foundations of culture themselves. If Kelemen sees manifestation of a culture in a chorus of howling mon- keys that reminds him of the chant of Egyptian priests at sunrise-why not infer culture among birds because of their song at dawn, or among frogs and toads because of their common croaking in the evening? The earlier zoological psychologists made the mis- take of being anthropomorphic; I have the impression-although I am not a psychologist but a mere anatomist and embryologist-that now human psy- chology trends towards obliteration of the differences between men and beasts. Albertus Magnus expressed the difference between apes and men by the words: "Pygmaeus loquitur, verum non disputat." Let us not come to a psychology without soul, without psyche. by ADRIAN KORTLANDT Amsterdam, The Netherlands. 27 ix 63 The weakest point in Bryan's (CA 4:297) paper is that he has studied what might be termed the anatomical and neurological "technology" in- volved in the evolution and ontogeny of speech without considering the ecological aspects and survival value involved in these processes. The following points should be considered: (1) Basic ecological difference between apes and man According to their ecological trend of specialization the Hominids could, until a few thousand years ago, be characterized biologically as co- operative, weapon-using predators, hunting animals that were often larger, stronger, and/or faster than themselves. To obtain such prey re- quires many biological adaptations. Social cooperation, intelligence, fore- sight, endurance, etc., may even have been more important than the use of weapons. The apes, on the other hand, have specialized as fruit and shoot eaters; when they occasionally kill and eat live animals, it appears to be a matter of seizing accidental oppor- tunities rather than of systematic and purposive hunting, according to the zoo and field observations known to date. Such a wide divergence in food ecology in related species is not a common phenomenon in the evolution of the higher vertebrates, and, conse- quently, few anthropologists and zo- ologists realize how immensely impor- tant are the behavioral implications of man's specialization as a "big game hunter." (2) Socialization of hunting techniques and extension of communication patterns To analyze the behavioral adaptations involved, we may study parallels in other carnivorous mammals, viz., in the Canidae (foxes, jackhals, coyotes, and wolves) which have shown a similar evolutionary trend. The smaller species are, as a rule, non-cooperative hunters of relatively small prey; the coyotes have an intermediate position, and the wolves are mostly cooperative hunters of large animals. For example, in northern areas, wolves regularly prey on such fast-running and able- bodied species as caribou, wapiti, moose, musk-ox, and bison. This chiefly requires a hunting technique in which some members of the pack outflank and cut off an individual from the herd or a calf from its mother, encircle it, and jointly attack and kill it (Olson 1938:323-36; Murie 1944; Young and Goldman 1944; McTaggart Cowan 1947:139-74; Burkholder 1959:1-11; Crisler 1959; Mech 1962; Allen and Mech 1963: 200-19; and personal communication by D. H. Pilmott). In some cases the evidence indicates that wolves may cooperatively cut off the victim from its escape routes, or drive it to terrain where it is at a disadvantage, or force it towards a pack member lying in ambush, which then attacks it from a favorable position, etc. At any rate, the occurrence of such hunting tactics in the play activities of tame wolves proves that these patterns belong to their natural behavior inventory. They have been said even to use the same 320 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="2">strategies as those used by Upper Palaeolithic men when they killed more than 30,000 horses at the rock of Solutre, or at any rate, a strategy not far from that. A study of the social aspects of wolf behavior com- pared with that found in foxes, therefore, can provide valuable in- dications concerning the behavioral implications involved in the socializa- tion of hunting techniques in early hominids. An interesting point that now arises is that, according to a study by Tembrock (1954:152-59), in spite of the fact that the instinctive com- munication patterns in foxes and wolves are largely homologous, the number of distinct patterns found in wolves is about 32% to 36% greater than in foxes. It is, moreover, the most expressive patterns found in wolves that are absent in foxes. We may conclude, therefore, that an evolutionary specialization on larger prey in conjunction with a socializa- tion of hunting techniques involving teamwork, require a considerable ex- tension of the social communication system. Naturally, a similar evolu- tionary trend also must have oc- curred in the Hominidae. Man's instinctive social communication sys- tem is, in most respects, however, definitely poorer and less expressive than what is shown by the most social species of ape we know, the chim- panzee. It follows necessarily that an alternative evolutionary solution must have been achieved by greatly ex- tending man's capacity to develop non-instinctive communication pat- terns. Thus, we have to assume that the evolutionary emergence of human speech was an intrinsic part of the socialization of his hunting techniques and must have been correlated with the increase in size and capacity for self-defence of his optimum prey. Conversely, the evolutionary reason why the apes do not talk is not so much that they cannot, but rather that they need not. I fully agree with Bryan's thesis that brain size should not be con- sidered a decisive factor in determin- ing the capability of speech. Wolves Jvze a brain weight of about 1/3 of that found in the great apes, while they have nearly the same body weight, but, nevertheless, some dogs (i.e., domesticated descendants of wolves) have been taught successfully by speech trainers to "cspeak" expira- torily as many "words" as the chim- panzee Viki (Bierens de Haan 1936: 57-63; Kaiser 1936:71-77). Further- more, the number of human words that some dogs can learn to distin- guish and "cunderstand,"~ as well as their ability to comprehend the mean- ing of human word combinations, ap- these respects, achieved by the chim- panzees Gua and Viki (Schiche 1922; Warden and Warner 1928:1-28; Buy- tendijk and Fischel 1934:1-19; Sarris 1937:257-309; Bierens de Haan 1949; Lorenz 1952; Renier 1956:79-80). These abilities cannot be attributed to domestication, for we know from other sources that the process of domestication never increases pre- existing abilities; nor are dogs more intelligent than wolves. It follows, therefore, that the linguistic abilities relative to brain weight (or relative to brain-weight/body-weight ratio) are very much higher in wolves and dogs than in any other tamed or domesti- -cated mammal on which such data is available, except man. Thus, we again find that it is, apparently, the sociali- zation of the hunting techniques rather than the enlargement of the cortex, which has created the pre- adaptation from which human spoken language could evolve. (3) Transtitraftce of culture, sym- bolic expression, and symbolization In Bryan's account, when he refers to apes and man, he essentially equates sound-mimicking, symbolic use of words, conceptual thinking, and cul- tural transmittance of knowledge and skill. (Cf. "The essential difference between man and other animals is the factor of language which allows man to communicate knowledge to other men"; "Man, when able to produce effortlessly a number of discrete meaningful speech sounds, began to explore the world of symbolic ideas which allowed development of human culture and ultimately of civiliza- tion"; "Theory: an ape which could mi-mic a variety of discrete speech sounds... could learn many human cultural patterns by the process of symbolic thought.") It is true that Bryan is aware of Yerkes' view (1948) that chimpanzees have a non-verbally transmitted kind of culture, and he is also aware of the existence of "talk- ing" parrots etc., but apparently he does not know what to do with such phenomena and, therefore, he cannot integrate them into his exposition. Since there seems to be much con- fusion about-this issue among anthro- pologists, particularly in text books (e.g., White 1949), the following com- ments may be helpful. In the first place, the term "ccul- ture" as it is commonly used by an- thropologists refers to both verbally transmitted and non-verbally trans- mitted aspects of behavior, irrespec- tive of whether such aspects of be- havior are formed by deliberate teach- ing and learning, by unconscious mimesis and identification, or in other ways. Unfortunately, we do not have appropriate terms to distinguish ture." (I should be grateful to receive suggestions.) For the time being, therefore, we can only formulate our findings concerning animals by stating that the behavior of chimpanzees is, to a large extent, "culturally" deter- mined; that the fear of human beings shown by large wild mammals is largely a "cultural" phenomenon; that many bird songs are an example of "culture," etc. As long as anthro- pologists continue to lump together under the heading of 'culture" any kind of social legacy inherited by an individual from a group member, i.e., any case where an individual derives some or other aspect of his behavior from another individual, there is no prospect of arriving at a less con- fusing terminology. Secondly, if an animal or human being uses meaningful words in com- munication, this phenomenon does not necessarily prove the presence of symbolic expression, thinking, and conceptualization, nor does the re- verse apply. Professor 0. Koehler (personal communication) had for some years a parrot which used to cry loudly and repeatedly, "Good bye," when somebody whom it disliked entered the room, but this certainly does not prove that this parrot had developed in its mind a general notion of what "going away" meant. Con- versely, symbolic expression and understanding do not necessarily in- volve the use of words. In man there exist such forms of non-verbal com- munication as, e.g., ideographic writing, European traffic signs, comic strips, etc. Furthermore, it has been suggested that pictorial representation in man evolved originally as a means to discuss and instruct cooperative hunting techniques (Morris 1962). In animals, apart from the cases of in- stinctive symbolization, as in the bees studied by von Frisch (1953), there do exist some cases proving the existence of learned symbolic com- munication, passive as well as active, by non-verbal means. For example, dogs may learn to understand point- ing with the hand by humans; ma- caques may show one another how to operate an apparatus (Mason, personal conmmunication); chimpanzees use various hand gestures (including pointing) as a means of symbolic com- munication, in captivity and in the wild, and it is likely that much of this gesturing and pointing is not innate (Crawford 1937:1-88; Kort- landt ms. 1962:128-38; Reynolds per- sonal communication; Yerkes 1948). This is particularly interesting be- cause, in human children, the devel- opment of speech precedes the devel- opment of pointing, gesturing, etc., with which it is correlated. With regard to other forms of symboliza- tion. VTave's and Haves (1953 :470-74)i Vol. 6 * No. 3 * June 1965 321</page><page sequence="3">showed that their chimpanzee Viki was able to recognize even schematic small-scale line drawings of familiar objects, which means that she was able to make the first decisive step towards the understanding of ideo- graphic writing, a form of symbolic language. And finally, young chim- panzees when playing with each other and with man, have been observed to perform such games of make-believe with imaginary objects as are often seen in young children, i.e., learned motor patterns performed in vacuo with a communicative function. In the London Zoo the chimpanzees trained for public shows have been observed to consume a non-existent meal, going through all the appro- priate movements with tableware that existed only in their imagination (Morris, personal communication; see also Hayes 1952 chapt. 11). By such pantomimes these apes have disproved W. Kohler's conclusion that chim- panzees cannot form "images" or "concepts" (Vorstellungen) of things they cannot actually perceive at the time. (The-Engish translated edition of Kohler's book seriously understates his conclusion on this issue in the original German edition.) Moreover, since these chimpanzees were able to perform their pantomime jointly with conspecifics (Morris 1962) and with a human participant (Hayes 1952), they proved that they were able to communicate to others the unseen things in their minds. That is, they created the very essence of genuine language, including concep- tualization and symbolization, though in a non-verbal way. Thus it would seem that, in the course of proto- hominid and early hominid evolution, non-verbal pantomimic "'conversa- tion" about the unseen came first, verbal talking much later. However, there is one difficulty with this con- clusion, and some additional facts must be considered here. (4) The puzzling problem of chim- panzee infant babbling Every type of vocalization in animals necessarily fulfils some specific biological function. Since vocalizing may easily attract predators, any un- necessary type of vocalization must be selected against. Strangely, chimpan- zee infant babbling, however, seems to have no biological function or survival value. In human infants the function of babbling is evidently to practise the sensory and motor con- trol mechanisms which are required to develop human speech, but in chimpanzee infants the babbling falls off rather sharply at an age of about 4 months and seems to lead to nothing, in spite of the fact that it appears to be homologous with human babbling. No theory on the evolution of speech can be considered satis- factory while it cannot explain the above facts. Two tentative explanations may be suggested here: (a) Babbling may have evolved by a process of genetic drift resulting in non-functional behavior that in a later stage of evolution was made subservient to the development of human speech. This suggestion may possibly make sense, if one considers that domesticated animal species do show a trend toward increasing vo- calization. (b) Babbling in chimpan- zee infants may represent a non- functional evolutionary remnant of an incipient form of protohominid speech which has degenerated in the course of chimpanzee evolution. This suggestion may appear unlikely at first, but it is supported by some in- direct evidence. The age at which Viki's babbling stopped was the exact age at which she began to walk and climb about freely (Hayes 1952:52). The suddenness of this ending sug- gests that at that age a specific in- hibition matured, preventing undue prattling under conditions--of poten- tial danger in the wild. This sug- gestion is corroborated by Hayes' finding that when she attempted to introduce a vocal element into the make-believe games, Viki became so frightened by this that these games ceased forever. In fact, wild chim- panzee mothers and their free-run- ning offspring communicate with one another almost exclusively by means of looks and gestures, perhaps be- cause behind every tree or bush a leopard may be lurking. Now there are many behavioral indications sug- gesting that in an earlier period of evolution the ancestors of our con- temporary chimpanzees mostly lived in more open habitats where leopards would be less dangerous (Kortlandt and Kooij 1963), and unpublished data). Thus tentatively the postulated inhibition would have evolved in the evolutionary period when the an- cestors of our contemporary chim- panzees withdrew almost entirely in- to forest habitats, thereby suppres- sing the early forerunner of human speech that may be supposed to have emerged previously in savanna habitats. In other words, chimpanzee babbling would represent a non- functional remnant of a previously functional form of inpiient human speech. This tentative hypothesis might in principle be tested experi- mentally, for example if one could find means (e.g., by brain surgery or psychopharmacology) to remove the inhibition that suppresses chimpanzee babbling at the age of 4 months. At any rate, the question remains why chimpanzee infants do babble and do point and gesture without developing speech, whereas in human infants the sequence babbling-speak- ing-pointing-gesturing seems to be a coherent whole. Unltil this puzzling issue has been explained it makes little sense to speculate on the possibility or impossibility of a spoken language in chimpanzees from the point of view of "anatomical technology" of speech. (5) The peculiar biological nature of man Having shown that neither culture, nor language, nor symbolization, nor imagination of the unseen, can be con- sidered to be absolutely and distinc- tively human attributes, we are still left with the question of what deter- mines man's unique place in nature. There is something very extraor- dinary about man, after all. Is the dif- ference between ape and man merely a matter of quantity and degree with regard to such natural endowments as were mentioned above? Or are there any scientific reasons to at- tribute to man some special property not found in any ape or other, animal? I should say that the truth lies somewhere in between. Man's pred- atory specializatiofn appears to have involved the emergence of certain features which clearly set him apart from all the other primates, but at the same time we do find in certain non-primate animals remarkable par- allels of such "chuman"' features. On the other hand, however, certain features which are common to apes and man and of which no paral- lels seem to exist in any lower animal, have been elaborated in human so- ciety in a way so entirely novel that ultimately something biologically un- precedented has emerged. Some examples may be helpful at this point. (a) The "subjective world" or "world picture" (Umwelt in the sense of von Uexkiill 1928) of man differs substantially from that of all the other primates. For humans, the character and the identity of things are defined primarily by their physi- cal and chemical properties per se, ir- respective of where these things are; one might say they are defined by the "thatness" of things. For apes and monkeys, on the other hand, things are primarily defined by their place and topographical interrelations, i.e., by their "thereness." This has been demonstrated in experiments by W. K6hler (1917) and Yerkes (1948), and it is also confirmed by zoo experiences (Kortlandt 1959). For example, if food (or any other familiar object) is given to zoo chimpanzees at a place where they are not accustomed to receive it, the apes are inclined to react tO it as if it were something entirely strange, and they may even refuse to consume their meal. It ap- 322 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="4">pears that things tend to lose their identity and character when they are displaced. In the Carnivora, on the other hand, a displaced food tray or other object usually causes no prob- lem, as every dog or cat owner knows. Thus the frame of reference by which each animal species constructs its sub- jective world has a predominantly mobile character in the Carnivora and in man, and a predominantly static character in the non-human pri- mates-a condition which obviously reflects the difference in food speciali- zation in these 2 groups, and which has little to do with degree of in- telligence. Now it will at once be clear that the ability to form images in the mind combined with a mobile type of world picture opens the road to the achievement of a mechanical technology, whereas the ability to form images combined with a static type of world picture opens no such perspective. Thus the integration in one single species of behavioral poten- tialities hitherto developed in dif- ferent species has created something entirely novel. (b) A similar principle applies to the organization of behavior in time. One of the most striking features in the behavior of non-human primates is their lack of persistent motivation. As a rule they cannot concentrate on one issue for any longer than a quarter or at most half an hour. (In the orang-utan this time span is somewhat longer, apparently because everything is done more slowly in this species.) The Carnivora, on the other hand, may continue to lie in ambush, or to follow the same prey, or to dig a den, for many hours or even several days at a stretch; and man may persist in his efforts to- wards an envisaged goal for months and years. Here again food ecology appears to be the underlying biological factor, for a herbivore and fructivore that persistently searched for a type of food not easily available would soon die of starvation, whereas a carnivore that was diverted from its chosen prey would never run that prey to exhaustion. Since all the specifically human cultural skills and products involve persistent working towards a remote goal, we may con- clude that the evolution of the specifically human type of culture re- quired the combination of the manual dexterity of an arboreal fruit eater with the long-term foresight and per- severance of a highly specialized carnivore. A unique combination in- deed! We need not be surprised that it took so much time on earth before the human species emerged. (c) So far, in the above points (a) and (b), what has been said about the peculiar biological nature of man alies t main b,oth as an individuali and as a social being. However, thes features are in themselves not suf ficient to explain the unusual charac ter of human society in contrast tc all animal societies. One could easily imagine a predatory ape species oi australopithecine endowed with al the features attributed above to man but nevertheless having an animal type of society. Such a society woulc never have been able to achieve any- thing even remotely resembling th human type of cultures known to us Therefore, though in the above w( have examined some of the funda- mental factors determining man' unique place among all the other animal species, we have not yet founc the most fundamental factor (o; factors). We might search for thes4 factors by studying human societie in comparison with animal societies The following points are pertinent. (d) All human societies are to a large extent controlled by systems ol social, moral, and ethical codes abou what shoucld and should not be done These codes are learned by the in dividual at an early age, by coercior and social induction; subsequentl1 they are "interiorized" or "intro jected" by the individual into hi, motivational system, becoming wha is usually called a super ego or con science; and finally they are passed or to the next generation, so that th whole set of social codes remains fair- ly constant throughout the ages. Nom the interesting point is that all thes processes do occur at the subhumar level, but no one species other thar man shows the complete series as I means to perpetuate the existing social order. For example, there is evidence suggesting that, in chimpan- zees and gorillas in the wild, fooc traditions are passed on from on( generation to the next by early con- ditioning, maternal control, and adul conservatism, but this is a non-socia type of behavior. No indication ha ever been found in any ape or bmonke) demonstrating something like the in- teriorization of a social code. Th anlage for that appears to be absen in them. They are amoralists. What ever good habits have been trainec' and whatever -bad habits have beer suppressed in a non-human primate every rule is broken as soon as th4 trainer leaves the room. This is no due to a lack of memory, for th4 miscreant will at once start crying with fear when his trainer re-enters It is rather due to the incapability o: interiorizing imposed social rules tc form a super ego. Wolves and dogs. on'the other hand, can develop a genuine super ego. A well-trained dop will continue to obey a commanc almost indefinitely, irrespective of whether his master iS present or not (either by accident, or because the temptation was just too strong), he will show clear symptoms of guilt, or even a pyschosomatic disorder; often irrespective of whether -his master is there or not, whether his master has discovered his crime or not, and in some cases even whether or not his master scolds or forgives him (Lorenz 1952, and cases reported to the writer). With a dog it has been known to happen, when he had killed the cat while the family was on holiday, that on the return of the family the dog was found hidden away where he appeared to have been lying for several days, without having taken any food or drink since his crime, and suffering from a psychosomatic collapse. This indicates indeed a true sort of super ego, and certainly it is something radically different from the mere fear of punishment as shown, for example, by a chimpanzee. In- cidentally, no indications of the pres- ence of such a super ego seem ever to have been found in foxes (Tem- brock, personal communication), nor in any other tamed or domesticated animal. It is exactly this fattor which has caused the wolf eventually to become of all animals the only truly domestic species, the only one that has become a real member of the human family, and the only one upon which one can trust and rely as a collaborator even if one is out of sight. Since the foxes are fairly close relatives of the wolves, and yet are non-cooperative hunters, we have to assume that the socialization of hunt- ing techniques in wolves has involved the emergence of a super ego in them. When some members of the pack lie in ambush while the others encircle the chosen prey and cut it off from its herd, the hunters obviously must trust and rely upon one another. By analogy we may, assume that the human super ego too has evolved as a result of the socialization of hominid hunting techniques, at the time when our ancestors specialized in bigger prey and as all prey animals became shyer of evolving man. However, the difference is that human beings pass the rules of their conscience on to their children by means of allelomi- metic induction and teaching whereas no bitch has ever been observed to teach her puppies not to defecate in- doors, not to tear up the master's shoes, etc. Thus the unique thing in man is that he has integrated the mechanism of the super ego with the mechanism of cultural transmittance of knowledge and skill from one generation to the next.- In this way the combination of two pre-existing principles of behavior organization into one system has created some- thing entirely novel and unpre- cedented. Vol. 6 * No. 3 * June 1965 323</page><page sequence="5">(e) The most essential feature characterizing the human types of culture, in comparison with the animal types, would seem to be the institutionalization of the social and cultural patterns. People are born, grow up, and die, but the social system in which they play their part remains much the same because of the continuity of the institutions. It is just this conservatism or inertia of the institutions which has created the potentiality for man's slow but steady rise above the animal level, for it is in the entirety of all social and cultural institutions together (rather than in the sum of the knowledge and skill of individual people) into which the accumulated achievements of the past have been incorporated. All our human ways and habits and things- language, customs, statuses, morals, technology and so on, in short the whole vast infrastructure of human life-act as one enormous conserva- tive force preserving the cultural inheritance from the past of which we are largely unaware. No such in- stitutionalization occurs in any non- human species. It is even doubtful whether any degree of institutionali- zation occurs at all in any non-human being. Certainly the societies of the great apes are very unsuited for institu- tionalization, there being (in chim- panzees at least) no evidence of per- manent groups (Kortlandt 1962; Rey- nolds 1963). But in the wolf society the suitability for institutionalization must also be very restricted, at least if we may infer this from the easiness with which dogs may adapt their social organization to changing con- ditions. Therefore, to find out what the biological basis of man's unique place in nature is, one should above all, try and find out what the biolog- ical basis is of his tendency to institu- tionalize. This is difficult', but a sug- gestion may be given. One of the most interesting features distinguishing chimpanzee societies from human societies is that-in spite of the fact that they do symbolize in their social communication-they never extend the meaning of a symbol beyond its intrinsic value. For example, chimpanzees can learn the value of coins that can be used in a slot machine; they can learn to work for money that can be changed at a later time; they can learn to appre- ciate the difference between nickels, dimes, and quarters according to their exact purchasing power; and they may both beg and steal money; but they would never learn to appreciate money as a symbol of social status and power (Wolfe 1936; Cowles 1937). Consequently, the richer a chimpanzee becomes the lazier he be- comes and no vestige of capitalism would ever emerge in chimpanze society. Similarly, chimpanzees oftei like temporarily to adorn themselve with clothes, finery, etc.; they ma' hoard curios, and they like to dra' and paint; but all this is done in; non-social context, apparently ex clusively for the performer's owr pleasure, without any social conse quences involved (Yerkes 1948; Mor ris 1962). Thus no chimpanzee wil ever raise his status among his cag mates by wearing the investigator' white coat or watch. Furthermore, , chimpanzee may use a stick or similai object as an intimidation or fightinE weapon, and he may even take - weapon with him when proceedinE towards the leopard cages during I walk in the zoo (Pournelle, reportec in Kortlandt and Kooij 1963); bul in social relations the possession of a club is effective only when it is usec for actual threatening or fighting, anc never would a stick be carried as ar officer's cane or marshal's baton From all this it appears that chim- panzees are unable to attach to cul- tural objects any synihclic meaning reaching beyond the actual use of such objects. Consequently, the pos- session and use of cultural objects can never give rise to any social institu- tionalization. Moreover, a similar principle applies also to other forms of behavior which in humans would involve symbolic processes resulting in institutionalization, but which in apes have no such effects. For ex- ample, if a scarcity of commodities occurs in chimpanzee economy, phenomena such as theft, extortion, bribery and prostitution may emerge, but no lasting social dependence is formed (Yerkes 1948). Sexual rela- tions influence dominance-submission relations, but the effect fluctuates with the sexual status of the female and no permanent ties are made (Yerkes 1948). In social intercourse, chimpanzees may apply acting, pre- tence, dissembling, subterfuge, trick- ery, and similar tricks well known in human politics,, but there is no policy, no purposive organization of co- operation, no division of labor ac- cording to capabilities, no attempt to establish something of a lasting nature. These instances demonstrate that perhaps the most fundamental feature distinguishing human from animal societies consists of th-e evolutionary achievement that enabled man to integrate with one another no less than 5 aspects of his behavior: (1) his technological abilities; (2) his interest in things of beauty; (3) his capacity to symbolize (all 3 of which had al- ready evolved at the ape level but so far still remained independent of one another); (4) his gradually emerging long-term foresight which evolved when he became a hunter; and (5) his need for well-organized cooperation and social stability, when hunting became a matter of teamwork. By such a conjunction of factors-and only by this-the tendency to in- stitutionalize could eventually evolve. Thus, an entirely novel type of social organization was created, a type in which the legacy of the past could be perpetuated by non-instinctive agents. (6) Conclusion Bryan started with the postulate that what he called "the essential dif- ference between man and other animals" is man's culture, language, and symbolization. Subsequently he attempted to find "the essential morphological basis for human cul- ture" by reducing, first, culture to language, secondly, symbolization to language, and finally, language to up- right gait. As an experiment, such a process may be quite useful and stimulating. Surprisingly, however, the CA commentators have focussed their comments and criticisms almost exclusively on the very last step of Bryan's reduction procedure, and none has seriously considered the set of basic postulates in his argument as a whole. Consequently, none of them has examined the implications result- ing from the fact that on one hand the same biological function may be ef- fected by quite different mechanisms. (E.g., culture may be transmitted from one individual to another by maternal interference with juvenile activities, by unconscious allelomi- metic imitation, by negative emo- tional expressions in the group mem- bers when confronted with something unusual, by verbal teaching, etc.; lan- guage may consist of speech, writing, Morse signs, hand gestures, etc.; sym- bolization may be accomplished by words, drawings, pantomimes, etc.) However, as soon as one realizes that one and the same function can be achieved in various ways, it will at once be obvious that none of the existing mechanisms can be regarded as being absolutely essential to that function, so that ultimately the search for an "essential basis" of human cul- ture becomes futile. Or rather, the whole problem should be funda- mentally reformulated. Instead of asking: What is (are) the essential basis(es) of human culture? one should ask: Why has human culture, in the course of evolution, become based upon this (these) particular mech- anism(s) and not upon some other? E.g.: Why do humans converse main- ly by speech and the apes mainly by means of looks and gestures? Why do humans symbolize mainly by lan- guage and drawings, whereas the apes do so mainly by pantomime? Why is 324 CURRENT ANTHROPOLOGY</page><page sequence="6">cured in man by institutionalization, why is it so lightly secured in the apes by transmittance of traditions from mother to infant, and why is it so strongly secured in the lower animals by instinct? By putting the problem in this way it should be possible to test certain hypotheses that otherwise woluld remain only speculation. For example, if one discusses the question of whether the evolutionary emergence of human speech resulted either from a process of genetic drift in infant behavior in the protected environ- ment of palaeolithic caves, or from the relative advantage of vocal com- munication in adults in a savanna habitat where they could see an ap- proaching lion, hyaena or cape hunt- ing dog from far off, or from the need for long-distance communication in cooperative hunters, one will never arrive at a solution as long as one does not consider the functional al- ternatives possible. However, if one reformulates the question by asking, Why do humans communicate main- ly by speech whereas chimpanzees do so mainly by looks and gestures? the whole problem becomes manageable. One can start to investigate, among other things, whether the young of nidicolous, den-dwelling mammals do or do not vocalize more than the young of related nidifugous and/ or lair-dwelling species in similar hab- itats. (E.g., by comparing rabbits with hares, spring hares with Patagonian hares, beavers with capybara, etc.) Also one can then start to determine whether the adults of savanna-in- habiting social mammals do or do not vocalize more than related forest-in- habiting species. (E.g., East African vs. Central Airican anubis baboon; baboons in general vs. drills and man- drills; various species of macaques, mangabey, guenon, and langur living in different habitats; and one may even extend such a comparative study to species of hog, deer, antelope, buffalo, etc. in different habitats.) Similarly, one can start to investigate whether the cooperatively hunting carnivores do or do not meet their needs for extended communication precdominantly by vocal means. (E.g., lion vs. tiger; wolf, Indian red dog (Cuon) and Cape hunting dog (Ly- caon) vs. various foxes, maned wolf (Chrysocyon) and American bush dog (Speothos); witih ihe coyotes, jackals, raccoon dogs (Nyctereutes) and South American wild dogs (Dusicyoninae) in an intermediate position.) Thus,, after having reformulated the problem of the humanization of the hominids in terms of apppropriateness of the mechanisms insuring survival in a given type of habitat, a vast field of non-speculative scientific research the biological effectiveness and sur- vival values of the behavior mecha- nisms and behavior components that occur in a more or less comparable form in both man and non-human species, will eventually supersede much unwarranted speculation about the process of humanization. In the present commentary it seemed suf- ficient to apply this method of ap- proach mainly to the ideas of cul- ture, language and symbolization, because these were mentioned in Bryan's paper. However, it will be obvious that the same principles may be applied equally well to other features of human biology and cul- ture. For example, the difference in degree of socialization between man and the great apes may be partly related to the fact that, in the course of evolution in the large mammals, a savanna habitat tends to increase so- cialization and a forest habitat to in- hibit socialization. Similarly, the evo- lutionary ori'gins in man of monog- amous family life, parental care by the father, and extended dependence in the child, may be clarified by studying parallels in other mammals as well as in birds. Furthermore, tentative hypotheses on the relation between food ecology and locomotion in the ancestral stocks of chimpan- zees, gorillas, and men may be tested by comparison with bears; for bears too are in some areas almost ex- clusively vegetarian and in other areas semi-carnivorous; they too are pre- dominantly terrestrial but can climb trees to pick fruit; they too are per- fectly able to walk upright, and they too have lost their tail. Incidentally, since they have never occurred in Africa south of the Sahara, their ab- sence may have left open the ecolog- ical niche in which the pongids and hominids could evolve. In short, there does exist on earth such an enormous variety of animals that it seems hard to imagine any problem of hominid evolution that could not be elucidated by com- parisons with non-hominid animal species. Maybe this commentary will stimulate the undertaking of such studies. Reply By ALLAN LYLE BRYAN 20. ix. 64 Kortlandt's comments, based upon years of research on primate behavior, are of great value to the general dis- cussion regarding the problem of the origin of human speech and culture precisely because they present testable working hypotheses rather than un- testable logical speculations. Obvious- ly, in order to gain further insight into the basic problem of discovering just which significant factors led to the development of man, it will be essential to integrate knowledge emerging from the research and thinking of scholars in many fields. We will never be able to experiment with the fossil hominids as they evolved through the crucial evolu- tionary stages toward man, but ethol- ogists and anatomists certainly can devise and carry out experiments for testing working hypotheses which emerge by asking pertinent questions requiring explanation and which are designed to elucidate the incipient stages of speech and culture ob- servable in other mammals. Perhaps in the end such experi- ments will give only negative results, in which case the method of logical speculative reconstruction, as so aptly performed by Hockett and Ascher (1964), may remain the only method for outlining the detailed evolution of human speech; however, the results of experimental and observational re- search might extensively modify Hockett and Ascher's present position and, indeed, might alter it drastically if it could be demonstrated that human speech arose from infant babbling and play chattering rather than from a call system as they as- sume (cf. Langer 1948:83-116). Frankenberger's plea to avoid an- thropomorphizing is well taken, al- though I believe that this type of attitude was probably the main factor which unfortunately resulted in post- ponement until recently of directed research necessary to tackle the com- plex problems involved in discovering the essential differences between man and other animals. As scientists we must avoid the latent emotional tendency to anthropomorphize, but at the same time we cannot continue to avoid tackling a problem because it might reveal that the differences between man and other animals are not as great as our anthropocentric cultural tradition has led us to believe.
