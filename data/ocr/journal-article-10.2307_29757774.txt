<plain_text><page sequence="1">Identification of Portrait Sculptures on the P?da of the N?gesvara Temple at Kumbhakonam by R.K.K. Rajarajan The N?gesvarasv?mi temple at Kumbhakonam can lay claim to a lengthy history, epigraphically dated to the time of Varaguna II (A.D. 862-80) of the later phase of Early P?ndyas. His inscription, dated to A.D. 869-70, records the gift of cows and money for the sacred bath and perpetual lamps in the temple {ARE 1908: no. 13; SIIy IV: no. 8). The record notes the place name, Kutamukku (an ancient form of Kumbhakonam, T. kutam ? Skt. kumbha), and the temple, Tirukkilkk?ttam (T. tiru 'Sri' is a honorary prefix). The place was also known as Kutamukkil {ARE 1911: no. 252) or Kutantai. The name of the temple, K?kk?ttam 'Lower(-land) Temple' appears redundantly in the Tamil bhakti hymns of the N?yanm?r, dating to the 7th-8th century A.D. (Mineshwari 1993-94: 101-103). The Tamil bhakti hymns and the inscription of Varaguna II would establish the antiquity of the temple which dates back to the 7th century A.D. Par?ntaka I (A.D. 907-955) seems to have erected the temple, the main vim?na. That means a temple built of perishable materials existed on the site in about the 7th century A.D. which was converted to stone in the early 10th century A.D. (Mahalingam 1967: 13; cf. Kalidos 1996: 141-45). Kumbhakonam is one of the few cities in India that contains a variety of temples to Siva, Visnu, Devi and other Hindu gods (e.g. Cakkratt?lv?r 'Personified Cakra) and goddesses (*). There are other structures such as a rathamandapa (Subramanian unpubl. [2007]), r?yagopura and so on in the N?gesvara temple. These are later additions from the Vijayanagara-N?yaka era. The stucco images appearing on the superstructure of the vim?na (Fig. 1) are also of later origin and are not C?la originals. The adhisth?na (basement), p?da or bhitti (wall portion) and sikhara (top member), including its two talas, are caturasya 'square' and so it may be called a n?gara-dvitala-vim?na. The sikhara in its eastern section is fitted with a mukhabhadra projection, as in the case of the Vir?p?ksa temple at Pattadakkal (Kalidos 2006a, II: pi. XLII.2) and the monolithic Kail?sa of Ellora (Kalidos 2006,1: pi. XII. 1-2). A colleague of mine considers it a gajaprsta-vim?na, which needs to be reconsidered because in such a case the prsta 'back' part of the vim?na should resemble the back of a gaja 'elephant' (Fig. 1), e.g. the Nakula-Sah?deva-ra/?tf (Kalidos 2006, I: pi. XX) at M?mallapuram in which the ratha and a zoomorphic elephant stand (!) For example Kumbhesvara, Somesvara, ?divisvesvara, Abhimukhesvara, Gantamesvara, Visvan?tha for Siva, S?mgap?ni, Cakrap?ni, Varadar?ja and Var?ha for Visnu. Among these six temples, it provides eleven temple cars, the only one of its kind in India (Kalidos 1989: 16).

What is significant from our point of view is the series of secular images that appear in devakosthas on the p?da section of the vim?na (Figs. 2-11). T.V. Mahalingam (1967: 53-58) has described all the images in detail but simply suggests that these may be royal personages and saints (ibid.: 52-53). I am of the view that this is a simplistic idea and there may be deeper implications behind it. The present article examines the inner-lying ideas behind these secular images. It should be noted that inducting royal personages within the temple structure is not a novel phenomenon. The Pallavas in their rock-cut temples display images of Mahendravarman I and Nrsimhavarman I in the ?divar?ha-Visnu-gr?^ and the Dharmar?ja-ra^ at M?mallapuram (Kalidos 2006b, IV, Pt. II: pi. LiV2-2).Raju Kalidos (2006a, II: 118) notes the presence of a R?strak?ta Emperor and his consort within the iconographical setting of the Kaly?nasundaram?rti image (southeastern aedicule) in the Dum?rlena (Cave XXIX) of Ellora. C?la temples are no exception to this trend as one may find the images of Gandar?ditya and his wife Cempiyan M?tevi in the K?nerir?capuram Early C?la temple and the images of R?jar?ja I and R?jendra I (Middle C?la) in the Brhadisvara temple at Tanc?v?r (2). Therefore, royal personages appearing in the N?gesvara temple as suggested by T.V. Mahalingam (supra) cannot be ruled out. It is worthwhile examining the problem further. The square p?da or bhitti of the N?gesvara temple provides five devakosthas in the south, three in the west and seven in the north (a total of 15) (3); the east, being the direction that the temple faces, accommodates only the dv?ra and dv?rap?lakas. The list of images is as follows: South: devakostha I: male-saint (Fig. 2) devakostha 2: male-saint (Fig. 3) devakostha 3: female (Fig. 4) devakostha 4: Daksin?m?rti (4) devakostha 5: female (Fig. 5) West: devakostha 6: female (Fig. 6) devakostha 7: Ardhan?risvara devakostha 8: male-king (Fig. 7) North: devakostha 9: male-king (Fig. 8) devakostha 10: Brahm? devakostha 11: male-king (Fig. 9) devakostha 12: Mahis?suramardim (3) devakostha 13: male-saint (Fig. 10) devakostha 14: Bhiks?tanam?rti devakostha 15: female (Fig. 11). (2) I am inclined to identify the two royal personages appearing on the eastern end of the mah?mandapa on its southern side with the builder of the temple, the mahardja and his son, the yuvar?ja. (3) This kind of uneven number of kosthas in the north and south is not peculiar to the N?gesvara temple. It may be found in the Vasisthesvara Early C?la temple at Karantai, close to Tanc?v?r. (4) The image is not a C?la original but was inserted later. (5) Devi stands on the decapitated head of a buffalo, Mahis?sura.

The above programme may be presented in diagrammatic form as follows: 5d A 6k 7k B 8k M 9s Bhi lOd i r dvara A Ardhan?risvara B Brahma Bhi Bhiks?tana D Daksin?m?rti d damsel k king M Mahis?suramardini s saint It is noteworthy that the main devakosthas housing the images of Daksin?m?rti, Ardhan?risvara, Brahm?, Mahis?suramardini and Bhiks?tana are elaborate and topped by a makaratorana, whereas the devakosthas housing the images of the secular beings are simply topped by a s?lasikhara that stands on kudyasthambhas. In some cases, the topping member is makaratorana-like:. In this type of architectural alignment less value is attached to the secular beings and greater weight lent to the major iconographical illustrations. That is to say, the secular beings are attendant on the major gods. The pratim?laksana of the secular beings need not be presented in detail as TV. Mahalingam (1967: 53-58) has done so on a rather elaborate scale. Nevertheless, a brief account is required for a better understanding of their symbolism. 4d D 3d 2s Is 408 [4]</page><page sequence="5">Fig. 2 - Saint (rsi), southern devakostha. (Photo by the Author). Fig. 3 - Saint (rsi), southern devakostha. (Photo by the Author). The images that appear on the southern devakosthas are the following: the first image of the saint (Fig. 2) is samap?da-sth?naka with the head slightly leaning to the left. The left hand is in ?ruhasta (6) while the right is in abhayamudr?. He wears a short dhoti tied with a waistband. The ears are lobed and the head shaven. These are sure indicators of the saintly gesture of the image. The second image (Fig. 3) is samap?da-sth?naka. He wears a garment, hanging just above the ankles. The right hand is in s?cimudr? while the left is in ?ruhasta (7). The head is shaven and the ears lobed. The damsel appearing in the next kosta (Fig. 4) is slightly dvibhanga. She wears a long-flowing loincloth, fitted with a mekhala at the hip. The breasts are full and naked. She wears the sakhal?bharanas. The right hand holds a flower while the left is in ?ruhasta. The next damsel (Fig. 5) stands in dvibhanga mode. The ornaments and attributes resemble those of the previous image. Her (6) T.V. Mahalingam (1967: 53) says it is katyavalabitahasta (cf. Ghose 1933: 167). (7) Mahalingam (ibid:. 53) again says it is katyavalambitahasta. He fails to distinguish between kati, 'hip', and ?ru, 'thigh'.

(Photo by the Author). right hand is ?ruhasta while the left is lifted up in katakamudr?, perhaps holding a flower (8). The images appearing on the western devakostha are the following: the first in a clockwise direction is a damsel (Fig. 6) whose attributes are as for the previous one. She has the right hand suspended below in dolahasta mode while the left is bent at the elbow and the palm lifted up, holding a water lily. The last image (Fig. 7) is that of a royal person who stands with his face turned to the left. The left hand is in ?ruhasta while the right is lifted up, holding a flower. He wears a cap-like headgear to which a royal outfit is added. The loincloth is short. The images appearing on the northern kosthas are the following: the first (Fig. 8) is a royal person who stands, turning to the right. He wears a makuta. The loincloth hangs down as far as the ankles. The next royal person (Fig. 9) turns to the right, and wears a tall kiritamakuta and a number of ornaments, including udarabandha. The next is that of a monk whose head is shaven and ears lobed (Fig. 10). He holds a flower in the right hand (8) Mahalingam (ibid.: 54) says it is varadamudr?. 410 [6]</page><page sequence="7">Fig. 6 - Damsel (consort of Parantaka I), western devakostha. (Photo by the Author). Fig. 7 - King (Par?ntaka I), western devakostha. (Photo by the Author). and the left has the palm extended. He wears a short loincloth and ek?vali necklace. The last is a damsel (Fig. 11). She has the left hand lifted up, holding a flower. The right hand is in dolahasta. She wears bangles, necklaces and patrakundalas. These images may be identified on the basis of certain inferences. There are three kings (9), three saints and four damsels. The earliest C?la epigraph in the temple is that of Par?ntaka I which might suggest he was the builder of the temple and that the three kings are probably Par?ntaka I himself, his father ?ditya I and grandfather Vijay?laya (10). The saints and damsels on the southern side are likely to be the rsis and rsipatnis. Silpa manuals (9) Ajit Ghose (1933: 169) simply says they are 'royal donors'. (10) Presentation of the royal family within a row is not rare. Raju Kalidos (2006a: 188) has identified eleven Pallava kings, equated with the Ek?dasa-Rudras in the Mahendravarmesvara Square of the Kail?san?tha temple at K?nci. N?yaka kings beginning with N?gama N?yaka arriving at Tirumalai N?yaka appear in the Putumandapa at Maturai (Rajarajan 2006: 147). We may note en passant that Raju Kalidos (2001) has discovered images of Pulakesi II in the Megh?ti temple complex at Aihole. [7] 411</page><page sequence="8">Fig. 8 - King (?ditya I), northern devakostha. (Photo by the Author). Fig. 9 - King (Vijay?laya), northern devakostha. (Photo by the Author). attest to the presence of rsis as students of mah?c?rya Daksin?m?rti (n). Therefore, these two saints and the damsels are likely to be any two of the rsis and their patriis. A saint and a damsel flank Bhiks?tana. The iconography of Bhiks?tana requires the presence of rsipatnis who doted on him during his visit to the D?rukavana (Kalidos 1986: 185-86). Therefore, the saint is a rsi of D?rukavana and the damsel his patni. The king on the western devakostha is probably Par?ntaka I and the lady his wife. The two kings flanking Brahma are probably ?ditya I and Vijay?laya. A male appearing on the right side and a female on the left of Ardhan?risvara are highly suggestive because if both these merge we get Ardhan?rivara with a male half on the right and female half on the left (12). It is quite likely that Par?ntaka I, an ideal husband comparable to Sri (u) They are N?rada, Jamadagni, Vasistha, Bhrgu, Bharadv?ja, Sanaka and Agastya according to K?syapasilpas?stra (Patalam 79); and Agastya, Visv?mitra, Pulastya and Angiras according to S?rasvatiyacitrakarmas?stra (Chap. 18). Vide, Kalidos 1991. (12) For a similar interpretation of the image of Harihara in Bad?mi Cave I see Kalidos 2004. 412 [8]</page><page sequence="9">Fig. 10 - Saint {D?ruk?vana m), northern devakostha. (Photo by the Author). Fig. 11 - Damsel {rsipatni), northern devakostha. (Photo by the Author). R?ma (13), and his queen, an ideal wife or dhamapatrii, are considered to be the right and left half of Ardhan?risvara. From the above study, it is clear that any anthropomorphic representation in a Hindu temple is not a meaningless insertion. It is a meaningful representation of a living culture. (13) Sanford (1974: 193-211) identifies the images as Dasaratha and his queens, linking them with the miniatures of the R?m?yana theme appearing in the galap?das. This is unacceptable because while the ayana events of R?ma are in miniature sculptures why should those of Dasaratha alone be life-size and again where is the need for so many rsis? The two important rsis of the epic are Vasistha and Visv?mitra. Cf. Ghose 1933. This article as the author (ibid.: 164) claims is the 'first' attempt to study these sculptures, followed by Mahalingam 1967 and Sanford 1974.
