<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE POETIC CONSTRUCTION OF NATURE: Hölderlin 's Contribution to an Ethos of Nature and Art Babette E. Babích Nature as Ecological Construct and the Ethos of Poetry According to the perspective of what we might call the new ecological sensibility, particularly as it is represented in the ethical context of deep ecology, the idea of "nature" pure and untouched emerges in opposition to the artifices (and artifacts) of technology and science. "Nature" is represented as apart from human intervention; correspondingly, human action is inevitably non-natural. Just as every negative in Hegelian dialectics implies its counterpoint, nature as paradise, the pristine wilderness, is de- fined precisely in terms of its relation to humanity. According to this definition, pristine nature is replete with possibilities for transformation, a mere plastic resource. The reference to human use here highlights the coreferentiality of nature and technology or art. In what follows, I examine one version of the critical, ra- tionalist critique of the romantic disjunction between nature, on the one hand, and science, technology, or art on the other. I will argue for the therapeutic value of the poetic against the modern (scientific, capitalized, and industrialized) construction of nature and suggest that both poetic and modern constructions are artful renderings of nature. Finally, less to resolve than to complicate and intensify the terms of the debate on the relationship be- tween nature and art, I offer a reading of Friedrich Hölderlin 's contributions to an ethos of nature and art. Where nature is seen only as raw material, the defining schema is that of fabrication and appropriation. Whether nature is to be Babette E.

Eabich "exploited" or "preserved," the intentional, orientational dy- namic of human appropriation articulates the difference be- tween rapacity and conservation. Preservation has not only the same intentional structure but also the same object as exploita- tion, for nature is to be preserved for the sake of later or longer human use. That nature has this utility, and that humans have every right to appropriate it, are not in question from either perspective. In the end, for postmodern sensibilities instructed by cultural and intellectual critique, nature represents the (métonymie) ob- ject of nothing else but a god-given (or natural) right, a resource. This is the righteous account of nature as standing reserve, not rendered in a Heideggerian but in a manager's sense: nature as natural resource is synonymous with the highest or rarest value. Yet ours is increasingly an era of de-mythification. And it is as easy to demythify nature as it is to critique its appropriation. Na- ture, in the sense of the natural fibers touted by upscale mail- order catalogues, or natural healing alternatives, or natural health foods, is demystified as a (merely) romanticized ideal. That is to say that the idea of "nature" is as meaningless as the advertising copy "all natural." Now, as the ideological critique of enlightenment rationalism reminds us, the ideal purity of nature, untouched by human hand, unspoiled by industrial development, has its provenance in a cultural dream. The further rationalist observation is that we ourselves with all our polyester and even with our many varieties of chemical and nuclear wastes are nothing apart from nature, and thus we are - polyester, wastes, and all - as "natural" as anything that may be found on the earth. However this is said, whether we read the account of nature proffered by rationalists and modernist critics, or we take the opposed reading of nature resonant in the post-romantic philosophies of thinkers such as Friedrich Nietzsche and Martin Heidegger, the idea of nature is a poetic invention in truth. But to say this is not exactly to say that nature is man-made, even if it does entail that as a poetic invention, there is and can be no such thing as "nature" in actual- ity, i.e., in nature. For nature, the natural, the source of what comes to be and passes away as the source of such unfolding, may not be set apart from our arrays, our ordering or cosmicizing concerns and deeds. By saying this I intend no démythification of</page><page sequence="3">The Poetic Construction of Nature 265 nature. Debunking is inverse propaganda, and I have no axe to grind. Thus I am far from maintaining with apologists for the proliferation of modern industrial development that nature is merely at our disposal. I do not then regard nature as a resource (this, I believe, is where humanists, logical rationalists, and Marx- ists - all alike - err). For both evil and good nature, that is, nature perceived as alien to us (and so needing to be mastered and tamed) and nature idealized as original garden (and so needing to be rewritten as our home) are, as Nietzsche says, equally inventions. That is, both conceptions are "poetic con- structs," as is the idea of our "difference" from nature. But with- out thoughtful clarification of the meaning of invention or poetic construction, we miss the fundamental issue behind the several convergent views criticizing our estimation of nature. Thus no matter whether we see nature as good or evil, or even if we catalogue our conception of nature as an anthropomor- phism, we nevertheless persist in seeing nature as a thing in itself, as something apart from or other than ourselves, as alien to us. In this way we mistake both ourselves and nature. We are aspects of nature. For Nietzsche, it should be added, the human as an ele- ment of nature is neither intrinsically superior (kinder or more humane) nor intrinsically base (crueller or merely, Nietzsche would say, all-too-human) in comparison with nature as a whole. Our humanity can serve either way. And if Irving Babbit is right to note - in an apposition made lightly naive by nearly a century of commentary - that while "the Greek, one may say, humanizes nature; the Rousseauist naturalizes man,"1 Nietzsche has become the commentator's Rousseauist today. Nietzsche catches the spirit of both proto-Greek and French romantic projections by seeing an order that must incorporate the two. In The Gay Science, an archly designed hand- or stylebook for poets (as vademécum and more), Nietzsche writes, "When will we complete our de-dei- fication of nature?" The question has acquired an almost postmodern edge in the wake of the Cartesian enlightenment project of rampant démythification. From a hypercritical per- spective, it is ironic that the perspective advocated by the pro- development, rationalist conservative could coincide with the Marxian argument for using all resources, that is, appropriating the whole of nature, for the sake of material human progress or comfort. From such enlightened perspectives, nature simply can-</page><page sequence="4">266 SOUNDINGS Babette E. Babích not be violated merely by being used or exploited (the very word, they will say, is anthropomorphic) because, in a kind of ideal wholeness or totalizing vision of absolute perspectives there can be no "difference" between man and nature. The logical man, whether capitalist rationalist or Marxist materialist, takes alien- ated nature as separated or sundered from its original or ideal unity with humanity and proposes a corrective in the appropria- tion or restoration of unity. Both the conservative and the Marxist are trying, when they say that there is "no such thing as nature, that nature is a poetic fancy, a romantic ideal," not to understand the issue of nature or poetry, but rather, so it goes with ideologues, to end the debate. For his part (this is the great difference between ideology, or démythification, and philosophy) Nietzsche (and in a different way, Heidegger too) could desire no such thing. When he asks, "When will we complete our de-deification of nature?" he asks this question in a way that recalls us to the heart of thinking, that is, to reflecting on the meaning of life, a task usually associated with the content (though not the image) of poetry: "When may we begin to naturalize humanity in terms of a pure, newly discov- ered, newly redeemed nature?"2 Nietzsche's notion of a naturalized humanity coordinated with a humanized, de-deified nature entails an affinity between nature and human invention (art) . The idea is allegorically mapped in a poem written on this topic by a classically - archaically - Ger- man Romantic poet, Friedrich Hölderlin, Natur und Kunst oder Saturn und Jupiter. Du waltest hoch am Tag* und es blühet dein Gesez, du hältst die Waage, Saturnus Sohn! Und theilst die Loos* und ruhest froh im Ruhm der unsterblichen Herrscherkünste. Doch in den Abgrund, sagen die Sänger sich, Hobst du den heiVgen Vater, den eignen, einst Verwiesen und es jammre drunten, Da, wo die Wilden vor dir mit Recht sind Schuldlos der Gott der goldenen Zeit schon längst: Einst mühelos, und größer, wie du, wenn schon Er kein Gebot aussprach und ihn der Sterblichen keiner mit Nahmen nannte.

Und hob' ich erst am Herzen Lebendiges Gefühlt und dämmert, was du gestaltetest, Und war in ihrer Wiege mir in Wonne die wechselnde Zeit entschlummert: Dann kenn* ich dich, Kronion! dann hör* ich dich, Den weisen Meister, welcher, wie wir, ein Sohn Der Zeit, Geseze giebt und, was die Heilige Dämmerung birgt, verkündet.

However much art (Jupiter) necessarily overcomes or subdues nature (Saturn), art grows out ornature, and herein lies the first force of its animation and vitality. But Hölderlin goes beyond Schiller or other Romantic poets. Jupiter, Kronion (art), owes Kronos or Saturn (nature) an ultimate, abiding acknowledge- ment, which in turn serves as the condition for and thus inaugu- rates a new age of harmony. It is important to emphasize that the poet invokes not nature but art. The course of redemption pro- posed is nothing earth-shattering, but a literal matter of awe and reserve. I suggest that Hölderlin can teach us how beyond the ecological measures that must fall short of a poet's demands it may be possible to save nature. Nature, diminished as it may seem in the modern era of art (or science), may still be com- memorated in song, and an age recalling the golden era may be promised as a redemption. Hölderlin's poetic gift illuminates the romanticization of nature as an anthropomorphic ideal or poetic construction and underlines the originary significance of a golden time, era, or age. Contrary to the modern or even Judaeo-Christian ideal of pro- gress exemplified by the concept of the fullness of time, an ideal brought to a certain secular pitch in today's modernist thinking, the Greek course of temporal advance was one of tragic decay. This conception of decay was drawn closer to a certain image of nature than the supernatural focus implicit in either the Judaeo- Christian religious tradition or the explicit optimism of the mod- ern project of manipulating nature. Progress, for the Greeks, runs backwards. The modern ideal of progress opposes such a ni- hilistic or decadent image and in contrast to the Greek perspec- tive, the modern view of an alienated nature presupposes a paradise of subordinate delight. The logic of modern reason does not contradict the Western religious perspective but is merely an alternate expression. Opposed to the spirit of this modern myth, Hesiod's construction of a golden age of lost har- mony is ordered to an absolute rule. But this is a melancholy invocation, for this era is past. It is the vanished reign of the now deposed titans.</page><page sequence="7">The Poetic Construction of Nature 269 In this perspective, Jove or Jehovah or Judea throws off the yoke of Saturn or Kronos. In ambiguous play on the phonetic similarity of the names Kronos the titan and Chronos (time), Ju- piter the son of time usurps Chronos, the old order. The names can shift as they do, for the oppositions or figures of opposition are preserved by the play of allegory. Thus we recall that the golden age, immortalized in song by the poets, was anything but an age of peaceful harmony. The golden age is an age of glory, but its titan Lord consumes his own children, fully meaning to include, save for a ruse, the child who would one day exile him to inaugurate the new order of law. This is Zeus or Jupiter, and Jupi- ter's measured law is born from Saturn's "primitive" peace, a peace both pristine (Saturn makes no laws) and inaugurated or first guaranteed by Jupiter's succession. Jupiter, we note, may also be named Jehovah and even Dionysus, for resonant and complex references are characteristic of Hölderlin. The poem begins with praise to Jupiter and the modern order of reason and bright day, the enlightenment. Not only is Jove praised as on high, literally "on top of the day," but his word is law, and righteous law. As the son of Saturn, he allots the just portion to all and "rests happily in the fame of his immortal rul- ing arts." But as Hölderlin liked to follow the classical Greek style of reversal, the second and third stanzas comprise an astonishing indictment. If we read the poem's reference to Jove in mythic terms, this is unexpected, although if we read anti-mythically, we will naturally hear no more than a romantic guide taken from the Hellenistic ethos and Stoic encomia of a return to nature. Thus one traditionally understands the description of poetry as holding a mirror, ut pictura poesis, where what is to be pictured or mirrored is nature in its purity. This, the art of art, is to seem artless or natural. But further reading cannot maintain the direc- tion of the allegory, if only because the nature of the connection is drawn too intimately. The accession of art is not the truth of nature but its banishment, its renunciation, so that mortals scarcely know its name. This is intimated by the singers, whose task it is to preserve such knowledge and to call art to account. Art is thus broader than poetry itself, but must be understood as the domain of law and order, as rational rule, as the science of bold invention and measure. The fourth and fifth stanzas, recal- ling creative art to an original and foundational responsibility to</page><page sequence="8">270 SOUNDINGS Babette E. Babích nature, express a filial debt which once acknowledged must be paid for, either with abdication or else with the honest expres- sion of gratitude that is the opposite and the corrective of shame. Both rational law and the primordially irrational titanic power belong to the full expression of every power that is or can be. Thus the singer asks that the creative artist or scientist or man of law recognize that he owes everything that he is to such fettered power, now mastered and forgotten in the underworld. Every- thing that we bear in our hearts is first begotten by this age-old power; again, every power that is grows out of Saturn's primitive peace. What the poet asks of the creative artist, the scientist, and every poetic construer of nature is what he asks of Jupiter with respect to Saturn: to be exactly the conscientious son of Kronos and thus to remember who he is. That what is asked is a matter of right order is plain: it is a matter of the recognition of service befitting what is first in the order of time. For the sake of justice, the singers are to name by name the older god of a golden time. (Note here that what is asked is not the liberation of the titan bound in "deepest Orkus." Rather, as a son of time like ourselves, Jupiter and not Kronos is enjoined to come to himself.) The penultimate and ultimate verses adumbrate the necessary prerequisite for and the value of recognition, that is, honor, or what Nietzsche named "affirmative praise." Thus the poet can an- ticipate that the poet will affirm or praise Jupiter, if only once filled with the feeling or sentiment of life itself, once granted the waning or softening of the light of pure reason, of creative calcu- lation. But this is to say that as the creative artist, as the artist of poetic construction, the poet will know Jupiter as he "knows" himself, as a son of time. And all of us are mortal, all of us like- wise children of time. In the blink of changing, rushing time, held in the poetic cradle of resonant verse, of rhythm suspended between past and future, one sees the gift of law and revelation, a justice otherwise concealed in holy twilight. The conditions for this recognition, for this affirmation of just measure, turn on the muted voice and suspended process that will be time in the balance for Hölderlin. This poised moment is very like Nietzsche's Augenblick, the winking blink of an eye, that is the moment. But in an ecstatic extension, Hölderlin is not catching the moment in the collision of past and future close to</page><page sequence="9">The Poetic Construction of Nature 271 Pindar, close to Anaximander and to Heraclitus, older voices from an archaic age. Hölderlin effectively arches the weighted moment in the cadence of poetry: in the hung power of the word in song. Thus Hölderlin draws out the moment as a still space, as a ccesura, which the English translator of Hölderlin's later hymns, Richard Sieburth, defines as "a space in between, an interval of silence in which the 'pure Word' may appear."4 This achieve- ment is the achievement of all true poetry. The ultimate verse is crucial perhaps because, as in life, last words often say everything one came to say in the first place. "Dann!" "Dann kenn' ich dich, Kronion!" Then will I know you, son of Kronos!" And the son of Saturn, that is also, in the play of ambiguous reference, the sons of melancholy, poets and scien- tists, echoing their origins, can finally be heard as wise masters, masters of wisdom, and not as pretenders to such mastery. Poetic Construction and the Truth of Nature Poetic founding or naming is key. What is at issue is nothing less than the literally poetic construal or construction of nature. Nature becomes what poets say it is. But from the side of law and reason, science too will be found on the side of the naming or constructive power. For nature is the life force of the universe itself. To say all this - manifestly to the poeťs ear - words inev- itably fail. But ordered in just measure, they serve a function for human beings, ordering the universe, naming the beings of heaven. For Hölderlin, who held that poets install what perdures, one learns from discourse, but such teaching can only be ob- served or consummated in song: Viel hat von Morgen an, Seit ein Gespräch wir sind und hören voneinander, Erfahren der Mensch; bald sind wir aber Gesang. (Much, from the morning onwards, Since we have been a discourse and have heard from one another Has human kind learnt; but soon we shall be song.)5 All that we are is a result of our discourse with one another - it is not solely a result of reason - the ability to theorize but requires the echoing answer of another, the confirmation, the challenge, the growth. We learn who we are from one another. But this capacity, reason, logic, language is not without its limits,</page><page sequence="10">272 SOUNDINGS Babette E. Babích for it is exactly the failure of language to say who we are and the failure of the poets in our time of need to follow what Hölderlin regarded as the poet's truest and highest task, literally to praise the most high. It is the failure to praise first gods, to sing the titanic powers ornature, that relegates us to a time of destitution. And what song promises, what our destiny as song holds out for us, is a redemption of meaning. The question here of modernity, as a newer time, as a time besides the golden time, the time past and lost with the titan's passing, is mirrored by the loss of the significance of the gods as such. It is, the romantics saw, not only the ancient gods who have abandoned their temples, but as Nietzsche memorably punc- tuated the same requiem for our century, the Judaeo-Christian god has been reduced to a civil signifier. Thus in the second ver- sion of the poem Hölderlin dictates to memory, he writes as his first lines, Ein Zeichen sind wir, deutungslos, Schmerzlos sind wir und haben fast Die Sprache in der Fremde verloren. (A sign we are, without meaning Without pain we are and have nearly Lost our language in foreign lands.)6 Here the problem exceeds human doing. But the key to the di- vine is to let be, as Angelus Silesius would say, given not as com- mandment but task: "Gott aber selbst zu lassen." The idea of Gelassenheit and the juxtaposition of Hölderlin and Angelus Silesius is familiar to us from Heidegger. What escapes easy famil- iarity is the referent here. This is assignment hardly to be fathomed and should be recalled in the spirit of the Cherubinic Wanderer's better known expression concerning worldly being: "Die Ros' ist ohn' Warum, sie blühet, weil sie blühet" ("The rose is without a why, it blooms because it blooms"). For Hölderlin, as for Angelus Silesius, the divine in some sense needs the human even if this same need is for our very humanity in its mortal es- sence, that is, its most vulnerable expression, and even if that need is expressed as the helping advantage of the absence of god. Such weakness and such negative consolation permit us to stay as wanderers in the holy night and to keep intent on the possibility of the divine in its return.</page><page sequence="11">The Poetic Construction of Nature 273 Denn nicht vermögen Die Himmlischen alles. Nämlich es reichen Die Sterblichen eh ' an den Abgrund. Also wendet es sich, das Echo Mit diesen. Lang ist Die Zeit, es ereignet sich aber Das Wahre. (. . .Not everything is in the power of the gods. Mortals would sooner Reach toward the abyss. With them The echo turns. Though the time Be long, truth will come to pass.)7 Here time, not mortal time but time in its length, is mentioned once again. "Though the time be long," it is also the occasion of truth. Once more, the poet's task is to install the heart or mem- ory of a people, and this works in the happening of truth, permit- ting truth to come to speech in such a way that it can be heard. Our modern time may be said to be that of transition, and the task of the poet to allow an expression of what cannot be said. This venture into impossible articulation is as old as Homer, where the poem achieves even more than words or syntax have the power to say. Although Hölderlin could agree with almost everything Schiller wrote about the importance of all the ele- ments of an aesthetic education and with Goethe's dynamic plan for poetic mastery, he also felt the tension of nature itself; but the tension ornature, of life, although echoed and mourned as a fading harmony since antiquity, is as an experience now very nearly lost in our day, and likely to be less and less available. The paradox in the power of words to say what a thing is and to bring it into being is thus achieved. We become mere signs to our- selves, meaningless, and as our words lose their weighting force, their old ties to nature, our art, our science, seals us off from all contact with origins. And thus we have "almost lost our language in foreign lands." This awful adventure of the paradox of lan- guage is the paradox of invention and convention, expressed for American ears by Thoreau's dictum: "we are the tools of our tools." George Steiner names the same paradox as the breaking, I would say shattering, of logos in our mouths.8 The answer Stanley Corngold gives this puzzle is the approximation to the "sacred" revealed in the connection to nature: "Hölderlin seeks Nature as sustaining time even in the very moment of its dissolution - a form of being that might stay 'die reissende Zeiť (time which runs</page><page sequence="12">274 SOUNDINGS Babette E. Babích along with violent speed but also tears what it touches)."9 This ripping time is a tempus we moderns can easily imagine, needing not poetic presentiment, the romantic apprehension concerning the industrialized transformation of the world, but merely day-to- day experience, especially in such a quintessential city as New York. The time of the city is calculated time, measured without justice. This is the city's time that none of us has, the urgent ur- ban time that tears. It is this weighted, rending time that is the time of the modern era - the Neuzeit as the Germans name it: the New time. We can now see that such a rending, tearing time is distinguished in Hölderlin 's Natur und Kunst from the golden time, the time of rightness, of straightness. Speaking elsewhere of the course or running path of a lifetime, Hölderlin refers to Saturn, Kronos, banished to the underworld and links nature's slumber as a possi- bility hidden in the vanquished kingship: Aufwärts oder hinab! herrschet in heiVger Nacht, Wo die stumme Natur werdende Tage sinnt. Herrscht im schiefesten Orkus Nicht ein Grades, ein Recht noch auch? (Whether upward or down - does not in holy night Where mute Nature thinks out days that are still to come Though in crookedst Orkus Yet a straightness, a law prevail?)10 What nature holds out as a possibility to art is the imperative of balance. The creative power is sprung from both. But the key is naming, as a task and as a sign of incipient failure. Nature is not a myth, but the force of life which, like Napoleon, hero of all ro- mantic dreamers, "lives and stays in the world" (Er lebt und bleibt in der Welt). In any case, our time remains a time of need - thus even the poet called to serve, as Hölderlin has it, not the needs of the world but the "highest" things, is called to serve in a time where Zu lang ist alles Göttliche dienstbar sahon Und alle Himmelskräfte verschertzt, verbraucht Die Gütigen, zur Lust, danklos, ein Schlaues Geschlecht und zu kennen wähnt es, Wenn ihnen der Erhabne den Acker baut, Das Tagslicht und den Donnerer, und es späht Das Sehrohr wohl sie all und zählt und Nennet mit Namen des Himmels Sterne.</page><page sequence="13">The Poetic Construction of Nature 2 75 (Too long all things divine have been put to use Heavenly powers trifled away, mercies Squandered for sport, thankless, a Generation of schemers, and it presumes, When the most sublime lord tills their fields, To know daylight and the thunderer, all these The telescope scans and quantifies And names the heaven's stars.)11 And what the names weaken, is given to the song to say, after an insight Hölderlin sees as his vocation: "das Heilige sei mein Wort' ("the hallowed - my word shall convey. . ."). Following Hölderlin' s word on this holy vocation, from his poem Wie wenn am Feiertage, we see that it is called forth by nature's power, bro- ken out and forth with the clash of arms. Den sie, sie selbst, die älter denn die Zeiten Und über die Götter des Abends und Orients ist, Die Natur ist jetzt mit Waffenklang erwacht, Und hoch vorn Aether bis zum Abgrund nieder Nach festem Gesetze, wie einst, aus heiligem Chaos gezeugt, fühlt. . . (For she, she herself who is older than the age And higher than the gods of Orient and Occident, Nature has now awoken amid the clang of arms, And from high Aether down to the low abyss, According to fixed law, begotten, as in the past, on holy Chaos. . .)12 Hölderlin's sight is not lost today. Nietzsche echoed it, as did Heidegger in his time. The question of the meaning of poetry, the question of the poetic invention of nature, these are ques- tions that go together, they have a common origin and destiny. Where poetry has lost its voice - where we cannot all name our- selves poets - one hears in the words the might of poetic resonance, the halt and measure of rhythm and balance. And this poetic weight is nothing less than the weight of meaning. What is at stake is more than, as some have suggested, the loss of the sacred dimension, as if the presence of faith or the obser- vance of Christian or Jewish traditions could or would be a solu- tion. Thus the poet Hölderlin treads the contested ground of philosophy. Hölderlin did not merely speak of the passing of an- cient gods as an allegory for the passing of the Judaeo-Christian God but for the very flight of the divine as such, where all the gods, ancient and modern, have in Foucault's words "turned</page><page sequence="14">276 SOUNDINGS Babette E. Babích away," and where it belongs to the essence of life to recall the golden age - the age of the titans, the highest gods, father Aether, or Nature. The imperative must be more than allegori- cal: it speaks to the very loss of the earth itself, the veritable flight of life. If it is possible to hear Hölderlin's warning in this way, then we, sons and daughters of time, like Zeus himself, are called to recall the nature of our kinship to nature, and if we do this, we are also restored to right measure.
