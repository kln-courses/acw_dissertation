If so, ordinary dreams and dreams due to opium or hashish should be classed as abnormal think- ing due to temporary insanity. 10. No assumption has yet been made as to whether in catatonia, circular insanity, epilepsy, etc., the same portions are or are not affected. That will be discussed at a later time.

SEEGER* DEPARTMENT OF PHYSICS, THE GEORGE WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY Communicated April 2, 1931 Part I-Their Mathematical Structure.-More than a year ago there was written by the present author' a critique of the new quantum theories prior to the general formulations of Jordan, of Dirac and of Weyl. Not that the latter were overlooked! On the contrary their very successes- and failures-are encouched in their mathematical reducibility to the simpler forms for physical applications. Then, too, the heuristic possi- bilities of the decidedly distinct, philosophical views first given justify any attempt to keep them separate. The recognition of this truth by Born, by de Broglie, by Heisenberg and by Dirac in their' recent books clearly indicates that the new quantum mechanics, already "classical"</page><page sequence="2">302 PHYSICS: R. J. SEEGER PRoc. N. A. S. in its mathematical technique, is still speculative in its physical inter- pretations. In each case the author's extensions seem to have intensified his earlier feelings. At the same time we cannot help noting that several vital matters included in the critique are yet to be emphasized. Hence, this synoptic survey of it! There is much confusion-not to mention disagreement-among modern physicists as to just what, in physics, is postulational and just what is experiential. For example, take so fundamental a concept as is ex- pressed by Newton's second law of motion. Every interpretation of this as an identity defining force is attacked by those regarding it as an equa- tion relating two measurable, physical quantities. What a difference! In the light of such haziness modern theories can hardly be expected to present clear outlines. And yet, here, above all, ought mathematical changes to be carefully differentiated from physical innovations. Indeed, this is the only safe support for one diving into the unexplored interior of the atom. Let us, therefore, set up the most general, mathematical scheme that will satisfy the basic needs of the new theories. Then we can later examine this for the relative merits of the various, physical particularizations without jeopardizing the value of the general scheme. In passing, we note that the very opposite of such a method is employed by Hilbert, v. Neumann and Nordheim.2 However, their presentation is based on a probability-view of the microcosm. With such an assump- tion no other method is logically possible. For the physical interpreta- tion has already been prescribed-if, indeed, one can ever speak of a statistical formulation as a description of phenomena. But one must admit also that the Hertzian (first enunciated by Goethe), prophetic promise, essential to the growth of a physical theory, cannot be born from barren, "stereotyped ignorance." Moreover, certainty about un- certainty seems too pessimistic for a science nurtured on uncertainty about certainty. So we hopefully proceed to examine the mathematical structure of the recent theories. First, we observe that its mathematical form must be purely symbolic in the manner of Dirac.3 And what is more, its algebra must be non-commutative-the sine qua non of all quan- tum mechanics since 1925. A Symbolic Algebra.-We shall deal with a set of terms that form a group. Terms that are capable of entering into the relations "greater than" and "less than" will be called magnitudes (a, A, 7, . . .). The rest of the set will be called symbols (a, b, c, ...). All the rules of ordinary algebra will be assumed to hold with the exception of the commutability of the symbols. In this connection we make the fundamental postulate that the idemsymbol be expressed as I I=o a u, v } a(uv - vu) (1)</page><page sequence="3">VOL. 17, 1931 PHYSICS: R. J. SEEGER 303 where the so-called brace-symbol {u, v} is symmetric in the independent elements, q and p, necessary to describe dynamically the state of a system (with one degree of freedom, for simplicity). We employ the word sym- metric to signify that the following relation must hold: uv2u = vu v. (2) It can be easily shown by the method of reductio ad absurdum that this is always a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for (1) to be true. Hence, three items are to be determined solely from physical data: namely, (A) the identification of u and of v, e.g., {p, q}, {p-l, q-l}, {p2, q2}, etc., (B) a unique interpretation of q and p, e.g., as operators, as matrices, etc., (C) the specification of a. After u and v have been particularly designated, it is customary to call any other functions, g(u, v) and h(u, v), satisfying (1) "canonical conjugates." The recent theories agree that for (A) u = p and v = q and that for (C) a - 2-. Their differences regarding (B) will be considered later. It is to be noted, however, that such choices in the case of (A) are wholly arbitrary. They are more the result of historical growth than of logical necessity. And what is the determining factor of the latter? Anthropomorphic economy of thought! We mention this, not in a derogatory, but in a critical sense; not so much to stamp the past with incompleteness as to prepare the future for complete- ness. For in this way we understand Cousin's statement: "La critique est la vie de la science." As a result of the form of the idemsymbol, it is found convenient to introduce the bracket-symbol (quasi-Poisson of Dirac) defined by [u, v] - a {u, v} (3) For any x and y, rational functions of u and v, the following relation is found to hold: [x, y] - a{x, y} (4) Consider an example, {p-l, q-l}. Now {p-, q-1} p-lq- {p, q}q-lp-l and [p-l q-'] p-lq-l[p, q]q-lp-1 therefore, [p-', q-l] = a{p-l, q-1}. In general, the proof depends upon the reduction of {x, y} to a linear function of { p, q }. This is always possible for x and y as rational functions. If a transcendental be defined by an infinite series composed of rational terms, the relation (4) can be extended to such. However, let us consider a case involving irrational functions, e.g., {p, q/2I}.</page><page sequence="4">304 PHYSICS: R. J. SEEGER PROC. N. A. S. Now {p, q} -= {p, q1/2} 1/I + q1/2{p, ql/2} but a{p, q} = I. If {p, q/2}" be defined as 1q-'/2, then the second of these relations is satis- fied provided that the interpretation given our symbols is unique in itself, as demanded above. Also [p, q] - [p q '/]q/2 + ql/[p, q12] and [p, q] I. If [p, q'2] be defined as q- /", then our second identity is true. Therefore, [p, q1/] a {p, l/2}. The arbitrariness of this method disappears when the interpretations are made. But such an identification is not always possible, as is seen below. Consider {p1/2, ql/-}. Now {p, q} I p1/2 ql/ q1/2pl/2 + q1/2 { p/2, q'/2 p/2 + pl/ pl/2, ql /2} q/2 + pl/2q/2 { pl/2, ql/2 and a{p, q} - I. It seems from inspection that there is no algebraic definition of {pl/2, ql/2} which will satisfy the second relation. This means that not all functions of p and q can be subjected to the so-called quantum condition. In fine, our algebra is limited in its usage. Thus the collapse of our theo- retical structure in any instance may be due to the limitations of our mathematical tools as well as to the inapplicability of our physical ma- terials. The inverse-symbol of any symbol of a group is determined by the idem- symbol by the following relation: x- 1X I. (5) We are always confronted practically by the form of x-~ in terms of u and v. Modern theorists never seem to be bothered about such petty problems. (Perhaps that is one reason their theories are inevitably of limited scope- and hence, unintelligible.) In this particular case, for example, they will use x-l without any thought of its meaninglessness if it be neither in- herent in the algebra nor defined additionally. Of course, this does not necessarily invalidate their final result so long as it does not contain x-l explicitly-fortunately. But then again, it may! The truth of this is seen in the exaggerated instance of using the inverse-symbol 0-1 indis- criminately without any knowledge of its nature. Hence, we believe</page><page sequence="5">VOL. 17, 1931 PHYSICS: R. J. SEEGER 305 that the problem of determining x-l in terms of the elements p and q is of prime importance. Two examples will be given to substantiate this claim. Suppose x = (abl/n). It is found that x-~ cannot be expressed except formally, as (ab) - /. Probably our difficulty lies in the obscurity of x. At any rate, some additional definition must be given before x-1 can be used. And this means that the form of x is limited-consequently, our algebra also. If, however, x - (gh)l/n, where g and h are canonical conjugates (i.e., [g, h] - I), then x-~ can be determined. A different situation arises for x - (a + b). Here again, another definition is needed. Postulating (1 + y)+'m/n to be an infinite series, we find that x has two distinct inverse-symbols. Therefore, there is a lack of uniqueness. What is the physical significance of this? We shall return to this point later. Now we have exhausted the content of our symbolic algebra. So we turn from logic to the mystical domain of analogy-what mathematicians defensively call "one to one correspondence." For we notice that it is possible to express the bracket-symbol in terms of other symbols similar to ordinary derivatives. Differentiation, however, need not be defined. All that we are to understand by the notation of the differential calculus is an equivalent-symbol. For n a positive integer and x any function reduced to simple terms in g and h (canonical conjugates), relations of the following type are found to be true: [g, x -] +n-1 + g +Xg+-2 + +gn-2g + g-l bh 2-h bh bh (6) IX _OX n-1)X nbx [g-n,x]- - (g-Xg-t+g 2g- +. g -2 +g - (6) g X g 1 h gh h The possibility of this formal correspondence between the bracket-symbol and the equivalent-symbol is inherent in their natures, as is seen from the following table: Equivalent-Symbol Bracket-Symbol bx Element - =- 1 [g, h] l I ox b by bz Sum ( + z) -+- [g, y + z] [g, y] + [g, z] ox y )x bx b by bz Product (yz) - - + y. [g, yz] g, y]z + y[g, z] ox ax bx This analogy can be extended to equivalent-symbols of a higher order, e.g., [g, [h, x]] - [h, [g, x]]</page><page sequence="6">306 PHYSICS: R. J. SEEGER PROC. N. A. S. bi.e., 2X 62 Xh bg bg bh The Problem of Canonical Conjugates.-Canonically conjugate quan- tities are always appearing in the new theories-symbolically. But there is a symbolism that is employed for clarification and also a symbolism that is used for concealment. Can the abstractness in this instance be of the latter kind? Can it be due to that lack of uniqueness ever seen, but never heard, in modern discussions? At any rate, one cannot deny that it is difficult to ascertain canonical conjugates in any particular case. The problem may be stated thus: Given H(g, h), find G(g, h) such that [G, H] = I. A possible solution has already been outlined elsewhere,4 but it is briefly repeated here as the basis for some critical remarks to be made later. Observing that G can be determined only if H be a rational function, we proceed to reduce the bracket-symbol [G, H] to a partial differential identity in equivalent-symbols, which is of the first order and of the first degree. If any solution of this exist, it must be contained in the solutions of the identity unrestricted as to non-commutativity. Suppose the variables are permutable. Then we have Lagrange's linear equation, which we solve in the usual manner. The so-called general integral of this equation is an arbitrary function of any two independent solutions of his subsidiary equations. We note that H _== is always one of the latter (at least for H, the ordinary Hamiltonian function). Finally we examine the arbitrary function for the restriction imposed. So far no interpretation of the fundamental symbols has been made. Two are in usage: p and q as operators5 or as matrices." We shall con- sider each of these separately. The Symbols as Operators.-Let qF(Z) - ZF(Z) and a- 6F(Z) pF(Z) aF(Z where p-l is so chosen that always pp-'F(Z) p-lpF(Z) and where Z is not a symbol, but an ordinary, algebraic variable. The introduction of the operator-concept extends our algebra to include all irrational functions, inasmuch as these are now defined. Moreover, it explains the generality of the interpretation of (1), in that any {u, v} is a parametric magnitude for u and v symmetric. For example,</page><page sequence="7">VOL. 17, 1931 PHYSICS: R. J. SEEGER 307 {p2, q2}Zn = 2a-2(2n + l)Z and {p-1, q-}Z" = a( + ). But n(n - 1) {p, q}Zn = -ln. Thus, in the first two cases we have the function Zn multiplied by a magnitude that depends upon the parameter n; whereas, in the third instance the magnitude is independent of n. Hence, our choice of u and of v to satisfy (1) signifies mathematically the selection of one of all the possible parametric magnitudes to be independent of the parameter. This is seen more clearly in the operational interpretation of (2). This latter identity is found to exist on account of each side of the identity being the same parametric magnitude. For example, (pq2p)Zn = (qp2q)zn; the result in each case is found to be n(n + l)a-2Zn . Likewise for (p-lq-2p-l)Zn = (q'-lp-2q-1)Zn; each side becomes a2 Zn. As for the inverse-symbol, not only is a meaning assignable n(n + 1) to x = (ab) l/, but the reason for two series for x =- (a + b) is made evident. If x - (a + b) be taken in its simplest form (p + q), then the two distinct results obtained by operating the inverse-symbol of this on Zn are as follows: (1 + q-p)-lq- lZn Z n-l a-o-l(n-- )Zn-3 -- a-2(n-1)(n-3)Zn-5 and (1 + p-'q)p-l'-Zn = n + 1 ( Zn+(3 +g (n -+ (n - 1) -(n - + a 3) _ _ _ _ _______O/3 _ (n + l)(n + 3)(n + 5)Z+nf5 These two series have different ranges of convergence when operating on a function of Z. Thus, they are not identical; they are exclusive. Of particular interest is an interpretation of our solution of Lagrange's linear equation. We are concerned with two identities, [G, H] = I and H d=- . The former is true for any function of Z; the latter, for one particular function. If H be the Hamiltonian form of the energy of a dynamical system, the equation satisfied by the special function is that of Schr6dinger.7 It is purely mathematical-a necessary condition for the existence of G canonically conjugate to H. The physical problem is thus reduced to the determination of a and to the assignment of boundary- conditions for the evaluation of /A, the arbitrary constant appearing in the special function. To illustrate, we give fully the problem of finding p2 the canonical conjugate to H = - + kq, corresponding to motion of a 2m</page><page sequence="8">308 PHYSICS: R. J. SEEGER PROC. N. A. S. particle with mass m in a uniform field specified by kq. By definition the following relation must be fulfilled: - + kq, G] 1. (7a) The use of formulae of the type given in (6) reduces this to 1 /dG bG\ aG - )--y p + p +k -I. Hence, for permutable variables we have as our Lagrangian equation 1 aG bG --p +k- = 1. m oq op From which we form the subsidiary equations mdq dp dG p k 1 Therefore, G - + F(H), (7b) where F is an arbitrary function of H. But at the same time P + kq -, (7c) 2m where / is a magnitude. It can be easily verified by substitution that the defining identity (7b) satisfies (7a). Moreover, this is true for the operation of (7a) on any function of Z. However, the restricting identity (7c) is true for operating on one particular function of Z only. We may write (7c) then -m + kq - P 0, where Ti - (Z) or 2- + 2ma2(kq - W)&gt; = 0, bZ2 where W =- 2m a2 . This is Schr6dinger's equation. The Symbols as Matrices.-Every associate algebra, such as ours, is equivalent to a matrix algebra.</page><page sequence="9">VOL. 17, 1931 PHYSICS: R. J. SEEGER 309 Let t-- r(NN)II where the elements of t are spectral terms. Hence, v(NM) = {(NN) - r(MM) . Let q , || x(NM)e2iv(NM) 1 i ~/ and we l rr(NM)e2Tiv(NM)Tr where q and p are square, Hermitian matrices (T signifies the time). Our first observation of the matric interpretation hints of weaknesses. For the fundamental postulate (1) is not satisfied ipso facto. Rather is it a restriction upon the arbitrariness of the elements of the matrices q and p, because it necessitates a definite relation between them. This is particularly apparent in the extension of our mathematical structure to two degrees of freedom. The condition of independence of the co- ordinates specifying such a system is expressed by qlq2 - q2ql - 0. Actually, this relation is one of interdependence. For suppose xi(NK) = 'kl + 5kli and x2(NK) = Yk2 + 6k2i. Then it can be shown that in the simplest case (magnitudes all positive or all negative) the following relation must hold for diagonal terms: 'Y7ki ki Yk2 5k2 But what does the notion of degree of freedom imply, if not independence? The infinite order of the matrices introduces a new problem, convergence. For the elements of q+n and of q-n are given as infinite series of the elements of q. And these can be shown to be possibly divergent or even inde- terminate. For example, in the case of the linear, harmonic oscillator q-1 is indefinable because its terms are the ratios of divergent series. Of course, q-1 may be used without reference to its form as a matrix, i.e., algebraically as a symbol. However, such a naive confession of ignorance seems too puerilely radical for a virile science admitting only experience</page><page sequence="10">310 PHYSICS: R. J. SEEGER PROC. N. A. S. as its raison d'etre. The question of convergence permeates the matric interpretation of the symbols. In the instance of the inverse-symbol for x =- (a + b) the convergence of the two distinct, infinite series must be considered. And yet, how can this be done if the elements themselves are indeterminate? An additional difficulty arises in the use of irrational matrices, e.g., q/2. By the extension of a proof, due to Frobenius, one can show that there is no limit to the possible number of latent roots of q'/2. Therefore, ql/2 is not uniquely defined. If the number of possibilities were finite, one might be able to describe this as a degeneracy analogous to the proper functions which, though different, all exist for the same quantum state on Schr6dinger's theory. But the infinite number compels us again to seek the meaning of an operation in the meaningless symbols themselves. A simple interpretation of the problem of canonical conjugates is sug- gested by the use of the symbols as matrices. The identity, [G, H] = I, is true for any matrix H; the identity, H =- /, specifies a particular, diagonal matrix. If H be the Hamiltonian function, then Bohr's fre- quency condition follows upon the identification of t and / (except for a constant factor). However, this involves the introduction of Hamilton's canonical equations of motion-corresponding formally to the setting up of boundary conditions for Schrddinger's equation. Seeing that our solution of the problem of canonical conjugates is not reasoned, only reasonable, we offer this interpretation of it soberly. In addition to the weaknesses mentioned above there are two others of great importance: the inapplicability of the matrices to cyclic co- ordinates and the tediousness of calculating matric elements. Hence, we conclude that the operational interpretation of the mathematical structure of the new quantum theories is physically and, above all, logically preferable to the matric one. And what more reliable compass in a storm of ideas is there than rigorous thinking? May I add a note of appreciation for the kind encouragement and helpful suggestions given by Professors Leigh Page of Yale University and R. Bruce Lindsay of Brown University during the writing of the original critique! And I am again grateful to the latter for his careful criticism of this particular article. 1 Seeger, R. J.
