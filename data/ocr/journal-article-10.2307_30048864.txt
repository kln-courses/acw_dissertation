<plain_text><page sequence="1">Profile of Robert D. Drennan Tucked away among the Andes highlands in southwest Colom- bia lay the ruins of the Alto Magdalena. The archaeological highlights of this ancient community are magnificent funerary monuments: decorated slab tombs surrounded by in- tricately carved anthropomorphic sculp- tures. Half a world away, amid the grasslands of northeast China, supernat- ural funerary motifs can also be found within the ancient Hongshan villages, as large platform tombs contain offerings of elaborate jade carvings of animals and dragons. These monuments signify that each of these ancient communities had a hierarchy with a strong symbolic basis. But for archaeologist and anthro- pologist Robert Drennan, it is not the similarities but the differences between early societies that are intriguing. "We've tended in comparative studies to focus on the similarities," he says, "and when you see the things that happen over and over again, it does suggest that there are fundamental processes at work in different places. And yet, there's also understanding to be gained in seeing what pushes one trajectory in one direc- tion and another trajectory in a differ- ent direction. What are the differences? Are there principles to be gotten there too?" Elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 2004, and professor in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh (Pittsburgh, PA), Drennan publishes his Inaugural Article in this issue of PNAS (1). In the article, Drennan and graduate student Christian E. Peterson explore the inter- nal organization of communities from three distinct regions where Drennan has performed fieldwork: the Alto Magdalena, the Hongshan culture area, and the Valley of Oaxaca in Mexico. Drennan and Peterson find that several critical axes of variability influence the development of these early hierarchical societies, or chiefdoms. By further inves- tigating these differences, Drennan shows that underlying principles guiding the variability of chiefdoms seem to emerge. More than three examples are needed, however, to prove Drennan's and Peterson's hypothesis. Drennan sees his PNAS Inaugural Article (1) as a conceptual exploration on how to make comparative archaeology more produc- tive. "The challenge that lies ahead is to work out, with these three regions, some good ways of analyzing primary data that make it easy to lay things alongside each other for reliable comparison," he Robert D. Drennan says, "and then extend those analyses to other regions we don't know firsthand." Childhood Dream Fulfilled Drennan grew up just outside of Louis- ville, KY, and thinks that most archaeol- ogists have an easier time of answering how they became interested in their field as compared with scientists in other disciplines. "It's just one of those areas that lots and lots of people were interested in as children," he says. He was no exception; books about archaeol- ogy and ancient civilizations were main- stays in the children's section of his library, and he was fascinated by them. "It's become almost a clichd of cocktail party conversations. When people find out I'm an archaeologist, they always say, 'Oh, I wanted to be an archaeolo- gist when I was a kid too,"' says Dren- nan, "and then they stop just short of saying, 'but then I grew up."' Drennan never "grew up" as far as archaeology was concerned, and his family helped in that regard. "My par- ents were not interested in archaeology, nor were they particularly academic folks," he says, "but they always encour- aged my interests and helped me pursue them." He recalls that on family trips his parents made time for visits to his- toric sites, and by the time Drennan finished high school, he had had the opportunity to visit several countries with famous archaeological destinations, including Egypt, Greece, Mexico, and Peru. Some of that early enthusiasm was tempered when Drennan began studying at Princeton University (Princeton, NJ) in 1965. Based on its title, he assumed the Department of Art and Archaeology would offer an appropriate major for him, but as he progressed through his undergraduate studies and began to ap- preciate the range of disciplines that fall under the archaeology umbrella, he re- alized that the department was not the right fit. "Art and Archaeology is the departmental name for art history at Princeton," he says, "and that wasn't the kind of archaeology I wanted to do at all. My interests focused on reconstruct- ing what people did in the past and un- derstanding better human societies and how they work and how they change, which is clearly the anthropological kind of archaeology, as opposed to the art historical focus in archaeology." At the time, Princeton had a fledgling anthropology department. Anthropology was only available as a minor, and the department lacked many archaeology courses. He noticed from his courses and reading materials that the most in- teresting research came from the Uni- versity of Michigan (Ann Arbor). The University of Michigan had just assem- bled a group of young archaeologists at the forefront of a conceptual academic shift of such magnitude-"a militant, almost messianic kind of shift," says Drennan-that it came to be known as "the New Archaeology." After graduat- ing from Princeton, Drennan began graduate studies at the University of Michigan in 1969. Into the Field In May 1970, Drennan headed to Mex- ico to begin his field studies in the Val- ley of Oaxaca under the supervision of his advisor, Kent Flannery, one of the University of Michigan's New Archaeol- ogy disciples. For Drennan, the dry valley air and excavated ruins were a welcome opportunity. "This was my first real field experience in archaeology. Up to then, it had been a library and a hands-off kind of experience," he says. Drennan was drawn to this project be- cause it took aim at the anthropological issues of social change that interested him. "Flannery's project broke a lot of ground conceptually," says Drennan, "in the approaches he and his collaborators took to the archaeological record so as to reconstruct aspects of human social, political, and economic organization that archaeologists had not talked about very convincingly. It was an exciting new way of looking at archaeological sites very directly as the remains of human activities and relationships."

Dren- nan relates these regional studies to modern census data. "We finally had a methodology to provide the comprehen- sive, general view of big patterns [of ancient societies] the way a census does for modern societies," he says. The other approach that Drennan under- took, and what would eventually become his dissertation project, was what is now termed "household archaeology." Dren- nan concentrated on the remains of a small farming village of ~2 hectares that existed circa 400-800 B.C. "By fo- cusing tightly on that community as a community, and sampling its area, we were able to identify features like house floors, hearths, and storage pits that represented individual households," he says. By dating and comparing the arti- fact assemblages within each individual household, Drennan could map out dif- ferences in wealth, status, and economic specialization of different households over time and pattern out the founding and history of a small farming village (2, 3). In 1974, as Drennan was finishing his dissertation, he accepted a curator posi- tion for the R. S. Peabody Foundation for Archaeology (Andover, MA). "As is the case with many people getting their Ph.D.s, I was really focused on re- search.... That's where my mind was at that point," he says, describing the cura- tor opening as largely a research posi- tion. The Peabody Foundation director, Scotty MacNeish, had just wrapped up a project in Mexico's Tehuacin Valley, northeast of Oaxaca, studying the origins of agriculture. MacNeish was looking for someone to continue in Tehuacan, studying the next major social transformation: the beginnings of com- plex societies (4). In 1977, Drennan left the museum environment for increased student inter- action and accepted his current position at the Department of Anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh, though he continued the studies in Tehuacin for several more years. Although he arrived at the university with a slightly cynical "research-first" attitude, he grew over the years to appreciate his role as a teacher. He sees the work he does with students as intellectually stimulating. "I wholeheartedly support the notion that teaching and research are mutually productive, they contribute enormously to each other," he says. Drennan (center) with graduate students Christian Peterson (left) and Song Xiaojun (right), returning from survey in the Chifeng area of China. Between an Inca and an Aztec In 1981, Drennan finished his work in the Tehuacan Valley and became inter- ested in chiefdoms from a perspective different than that of a Mesoamerican one. "I began to think how strange it was that so much of what we knew about chiefdoms came from the small handful of the world's famous archaeo- logical regions," he says, "and, in all of those regions, the chiefdom society was a fairly short stage on the way toward something much larger-scale and more complicated, like states and even em- pires." Chiefdoms in many other parts of the world, however, either slowly or never moved on to more complex societ- ies, and these places were exactly the areas in which Drennan became inter- ested. One such region was the Inter- mediate Area, so labeled because it sat between the early civilization epicenters of Mesoamerica and the central Andes. Drennan's interest was particularly piqued by the Alto Magdalena in south- west Colombia. The spectacular tombs and statues near the town of San Agustin made this area the most famous archaeological site of northern South America. In his background research, Drennan found, to his surprise, that more archaeological study had been car- ried out in this area than he had known. "It was carried out by skillful Colom- bian archaeologists like Luis Duque, Julio C6sar Cubillos, and H6ctor Llanos, who published lots and lots of stuff, but it just never got much attention past Colombia's borders," he says (5). Previ- ous work was focused on the scale of the single archaeological sites and struc- tures, and Drennan was interested in putting that information into a regional context. "From the tombs, we knew a lot about how people died, at least the important ones," he says, "but we knew very little about how they lived, at least on a scale larger than a household." Colombia was regarded, however, as a country where archaeology was closed to foreigners because of government regulations dating to the early 1970s. The regulations were aimed at protecting Colombia's national heritage because archaeological research by foreigners was often complicated by contentious issues of national and ethnic identity and cultural property rights. "Imagine how a white American tourist might feel visiting Mount Vernon and seeing a Japanese archaeological expedition dig- ging up the slave quarters?" says Dren- nan. Another reason for Colombia's stringent regulations was that Latin American archaeologists often felt mar- ginalized by their North American coun- terparts. "We can sometimes seem to come in with large budgets, do our projects with little contact with local colleagues, bundle up our data, go home, and no one from the host coun- try has much chance to find out what we've discovered," he explains. Colom- bia's regulations sought to curb such actions. Fortunately, the regulations gave the Colombian Institute of Anthropology the flexibility to waive requirements if it 3958 I www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.0601263103 Zagorski</page><page sequence="3">deemed a project was in the national interest, and under this rubric, Drennan received permission to carry out his work. Carlos Uribe, a recent doctoral graduate of the University of Pittsburgh in cultural anthropology, was chair of the Anthropology Department at the University of the Andes in Bogotai, Colombia. He, like many Colombian archaeologists, was concerned about in- creasing the opportunities for Colombi- ans to study abroad, improving access to international scholarly literature, and creating field training opportunities for Colombian undergraduates. Together with Drennan and colleagues at other anthropology programs in Colombia, Uribe developed a proposal for a collab- orative project that would operate es- sentially as a field school for Colombian undergraduates. Roberto Pineda, then director of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology, enthusiastically supported and authorized the project. Drennan notes that over the past 20- plus years since its inception, more than 300 Colombian students have partici- pated in the outreach program, and many have gone on to receive master's and doctoral degrees from the Univer- sity of Pittsburgh and other universities abroad. "We've worked together with the institute and several Colombian uni- versities to see that the existence of the research is of benefit to Colombia," he says. Drennan believes it is important for North American archaeologists to take such concerns seriously because, besides simply being the respectful way to treat colleagues in a different coun- try, foreign archaeological research that does not take such an attitude is not likely to be permitted in the future. Seeing Through the Filter "Shifting to Colombia had the desired effect," says Drennan, "in that it stimu- lated me to think new thoughts, about chiefdoms in general and the Mexican chiefdoms I had worked on previously." Drennan was impressed by the amount of variety in social, economic, and politi- cal organization that existed between the two chiefdoms he had studied, such as how the prehistoric inhabitants of the Alto Magdalena were not organized into compact, nucleated villages but rather widely dispersed across the landscape. Such observations led Drennan to focus on the variability of chiefdoms. In 1998, Drennan was invited by col- leagues Kathy Linduff at the University of Pittsburgh and Gideon Shelach at The Hebrew University of Jerusalem to participate in a research project at Chifeng in Inner Mongolia, China. The invitation proved fortuitous. Drennan initially imagined a modest commitment of time to the fieldwork in China be- cause he aimed to continue his research "From the tombs, we knew a lot about how people died... but we knew very little about how they lived." in Colombia. But the conditions in Co- lombia began to deteriorate to where it was no longer safe for his team to work in the Alto Magdalena. "At that same time, I became increasingly fascinated with what I was learning about the Hongshan culture [in China] and at the possibility of coming to know firsthand yet a third chiefdom trajectory," he says, "so it was quite natural to plunge more deeply into the Chifeng project." At present, Drennan continues work with colleagues in the Hongshan culture area and anticipates two more seasons of fieldwork, followed by several years of analysis. Conditions in Colombia have stabilized, and Drennan is excited about the opportunity to resume his research in the Alto Magdalena. He is currently pur- suing new research techniques such as remote sensing and ground-penetrating radar to obtain information about subterranean structures without having to excavate them. The Alto Magdalena settlements are well dispersed, and community studies by excavation can be difficult. Although Drennan does not rule out the possibility of beginning a new project in yet another part of the world, he admits that such a task would be daunting. "There's a reason that archae- ologists don't specialize in 12 different regions. You have to learn a lot about one region in order to do good research there, it's a big investment," he says. The investment involves learning the language, history, culture, and even poli- tics of the region. Even by working on three distinct geographic areas, Drennan has already become a bit of a rare bird, as most archaeologists specialize in one specific region. "You only know about other regions what you can read about them," he says, "and you can't just rely on secondary sources. Are you really comparing the archaeological evidence or comparing the way archaeologists do archaeology in those regions?" Such filters, which archaeologists may unintentionally apply to their own re- search, are important obstacles to over- come, according to Drennan. In his PNAS Inaugural Article (1) and other recent literature (6, 7), Drennan has begun examining methods of analyzing primary data from different regions in ways that make the results more compa- rable and reliable. One technique he has used applies multidimensional scaling analysis to artifact assemblages within individual households to create compact, but direct, graphical representations of household relationships within a village. In this way, if researchers on a similar project publish their results in detail, one could look at the different repre- sentations and ask "are the patterns in this West African village similar to the patterns that we find in Oaxaca vil- lages," asks Drennan, "or are they more like the patterns in Alto Magdalena households?" With his Inaugural Arti- cle, Drennan hopes to take the first step in constructing such a new, comparative archaeological dialogue. Nick Zagorski, Science Writer 1. Drennan, R. D. &amp; Peterson, C.
