<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS IN THE ARAMAIC TARGUMS TO THE PROPHETS* BY RIMMON KASHER Bar-Ilan University, Ramat-Gan A belief in the existence of angels is basic to the Aramaic Targums to the Bible, as it is to the overwhelming majority of Jewish literature. In this respect these branches of literature are merely reflecting well established beliefs of the Ancient East and the Hellenistic world, signs of which are already discernible in the Bible. However, a careful exam ination of the available material will show that the Aramaic Targums do not reflect identical conceptions or trends. For example, A. Shinan has demonstrated considerable differences between the angelology of Targum Pseudo-Jonathan, on the one hand, and the Palestinian Targums to the Pentateuch, on the other, both in the frequency of their refer ences to angels and in the attitude expressed therein.1 In this article I would like to examine angelological ideas as reflected in the Aramaic Targums to the books of the Prophets: Targum Jonathan (hereafter: TJ), on the one hand, and the so-called "Tose(tot Targum" (hereafter: TTs), on the other. Indeed, the Toseftot Targum to the Prophets, unlike TJ, do not constitute a "corpus" in the strict sense, being scattered in numerous manuscripts; we do not possess even one manuscript encompassing all the Toseftas—such a manuscript most probably never existed. Nevertheless, an overview of the TTs uncov ers a largely uniform world of beliefs, and this is true, inter alia, of their treatment of the angelic world. It appears that despite the basic assumption, common to both TJ and the TTs, that the angelic world exists, the two Targums differ in their attitudes to angels. The differences extend to the frequency of * This article is based on R. Kasher, Targumic Toseftot to the Prophets (Sources for the Study of Jewish Culture, vol.

Speaking generally, one might say that TJ avoids mentioning angels as far as possible; to quote Smolar and Aberbach, "TJ . . . tends to restrict the significance and activity of the angels."2 The TTs, on the other hand, incline toward the opposite extreme, some offering details never mentioned in the Bible or even in TJ. Nevertheless, they do adhere to certain restric tions which, surprisingly, are not observed in TJ or indeed in other Jewish literary works. I. Discretion on two counts: Anonymity versus Identification, Detail (1) Let us begin with the different treatments of the angel who appears to Joshua at Jericho. In Josh. 5,14 this angel presents himself as "captain of the Lord's host," and the next verse also refers to the angel as such. TJ3 renders the title as "an angel sent from before the Lord" (v. 14) or "an angel who has been sent by the Lord" (v. 15). This translation avoids any reference to God's heavenly host or to a hierarchy in the angelic world; naturally, therefore, it does not con sider the angel himself as possessing any kind of elevated rank. The various TTs to this verse4 reflect the same policy of interpre tation or translation. However, not content to leave the angel anony mous, while on the other hand reluctant to associate him with the Lord's host, they identify Joshua's angel with Uriel/Ariel,5 and set out his tremendous size in detail: (13) And it came to pass, when Joshua came to fight at Jericho, he looked up and saw an angel standing before him, and his name was Uriel, and his length was as from the earth to the heavens, and his width was as from Egypt to 2 L.

Sperber, The Bible in Aramaic, II-III, Leiden: EJ. Brill, 1959-1962. 4 The quotation below is based on the complete manuscript, MS New York JTS L899a, fol. 83b-84a. Other MSS containing this TT, with variations, are the Genizah fragments MS Cambridge T.-S. Β 13,12, and MS New York JTS L607, fol. 5. 5 The Genizah fragment reads "Ariel" (^ΚΉΚ), and as this MS is written in plene spelling, it is dubious whether one should read "Uriel" for "Ariel." Both names are known from other angelological sources. For Uriel in Second Temple period literature see The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, ed. J.H. Charlesworth, I-II, New York: Doubleday, 1983-1985, Index, s.v. "Uriel." For Rabbinic literature see R. Margaliyot, Mal'akhei 'Elyon, Jerusalem: Mossad Ha-Rav Kook, 19642, 5-10. For the angel Ariel see Margaliyot, ib., 17.</page><page sequence="3">170 RIMMON KASHER Jericho, and his sword was drawn from sheath to sheath in his hand. Joshua threw himself face down on the ground and asked him, saying, Have you come to help us or do you wish to slay our enemies? (14) And he said, I have not come to help, neither am I an enemy; I am an angel, sent by the Lord\ Now I have come. . . . To punish you . . . have I come. . . . And Joshua threw himself face down on the ground and said, I pray You, Ο Lord, forgive your servant's sins on account of his deeds. And he said to him, Everything that was uttered before the Lord must be fulfilled and carried out. (15) And the angel who was sent by the Lord said to Joshua . . . While in w. 14-15 the TT concurs with the interpretational-trans lational basis of TJ as to the title "captain of the Lord's host," its ver sion of v. 13 introduces elements found neither in the Bible nor in TJ: the angel's name is Uriel/Ariel, and he is gigantic: his length is the distance from earth to heaven, his width, the distance from Egypt to Jericho.6 Nevertheless, the TT adopts some caution with respect to the angel. In the Bible, Joshua prostrates himself only after the apparition has identified itself as "captain of the Lord's host" (v. 14), and he addresses the angel as adoni, "my lord." TJ translates literally, "What does my lord (nbboni) command his servant?" Lacking any explicit message from God, the word "my lord" is clearly referring to the angel. Not so in the TT. Despite the grandiose description of the angel Uriel, Joshua does not address the angel at all at this point. Instead, the Targum understands Joshua's question "What does my lord etc." as a declara tion of submission to God: "Everything that was uttered before the Lord must be fulfilled and carried out." In other words: "my lord" is taken as referring to God. Moreover, Joshua appeals directly to God, ignoring the angel: ". . . and said, I pray You, Ο lord." Thus the TT under discussion differs from TJ in explicitly naming the angel and defining his size. At the same time, it nevertheless takes a restrictive view of the angel's function, assigning him no intermedi ary role and a fortiori not deifying him or putting him in God's place. TJ's tendency to avoid any reference to a heavenly "army" or host of any kind, exemplified by its translation of "captain of the Lord's host" as "angel sent by the Lord," may be detected elsewhere as well. 6 Possibly an allusion to the legend that the angel who appeared to Joshua was the one who had appeared to Moses in the thornbush. This legend is also featured in the TT to Josh. 5,14 in MS University of Salamanca 1, written in 1532 by Alfonso de Zamora.</page><page sequence="4">171 ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS For example, TJ generally understands the phrase "Lord of hosts" as a proper noun, therefore not translating but rendering it in the origi nal biblical Hebrew. The same is true of such phrases as "the God of hosts."7 The The Targums to the Hagiographa, on the other hand, sometimes take a different course. Thus, the Targum to Ps. 89,9 translates the phrase "Lord, God of hosts" as "Lord, God over all soldiers of the heavens," while 1 Chr. 17,24, "Lord of hosts," is rendered similarly. This translation/interpretation was apparently also common in Prophets. An echo may be found in Targum Esth. 1,4,8 where Hag. 2,8 is cited: MT The silver is mine and the gold is mine—says ה צבאות TJ The silver is mine and the gold is mine—says ה צבאות T. Esth. The silver is mine and the gold is mine—says די חילוותא□ h [= [= The Lord, commander of the hosts] Does the quotation from Targum Esther represent the translation of an isolated verse, or is this a remnant of an overall interpretational approach to the translation of Prophets, departing from that of our present TJ? Currently available data are insufficient to permit a definite conclusion. The fact that TJ, followed by the TT as cited, avoid ascribing heav enly hosts to God9 is thus particularly striking, given the evidence of an alternative Jewish tradition of translation/interpretation. Parallels to this tradition, incidentally, may be found both in the Peshitta10 and in the Syro-Palestinian translation." ' Cf. 2 Sam. 5,10; 1 Kgs. 19,10.14; Jer. 5,14; 15,16; 35,17; 38,17; 44,7; Hos. 12,6; Am. 3,13; 4,13; 5,14-16.27; 6,8.14; 9,5. On the possibility of interpreting the Hebrew word zeva'ot, generally translated as "hosts," in the sense of actual military forces see J.A. Emerton, "New Light on Israelite Religion," %AW 94 (1982), 3-9. On the descrip tion of angels as soldiers see B.A. Levine, "The Language of the Magical Bowls," in: J.

Goshen-Gottstein, Fragments of Lost Targumim, II, Ramat-Gan: Bar-Ilan University Press, 1989, 31. 9 But cf. TJ to 1 Kgs. 22,19, translating "the host of heaven" as "the soldiers of heaven." 10 E.g., to Josh. 5,14.15: "I am the military commander of the Lord"; to Hag. 2,6.8: "Says the Lord of hosts. . . 11 E.g., in 1 Sam. 4,4: "the Ark of the Lord of Hosts Enthroned on the Cherubim"</page><page sequence="5">172 RIMMON KASHER (2) The naming of an angel who is mentioned anonymously in the Bible and in TJ may also be found in three different TTs to 2 Kgs. 19,35. Let us first compare the different translations with the original text:12 MT ... an angel of the Lord went out and struck down . . . TJ ... an angel of the Lord went out and slew . . . TT The mymr' of the Lord caused confusion in the camp of Sennache rib King of Assyria, and Michael, the angel of the Lord, went out and slew . . . Thus, the TT to the verse identifies the angel who smote the Assyrians as Michael, an angel already familiar from the book of Daniel (10,13.21; 12,1) and much of post-biblical literature.13 On the other hand, TTs to Ezek. 1,114 and Is. 10,3215 identify the same angel as Gabriel, who also appears in Dan. (8,16; 9,21), and is quite prominent in post biblical literature.16 These TTs clearly share the tendency, foreign to the Bible and TJ, not to leave any angel unnamed. At the same time, the TT to Ezek. 1,1 introduces a detail unmen tioned in the Bible or in TJ, also referring to the Assyrian defeat: The angel Gabriel, who is one of His emissaries, went out and appeared from the Temple Wall and burned all the camps with fire. I cannot explain why the angel Gabriel is said to appear "from the Temple wall." At any rate, unlike TJ, the TT is of course expanding and adding to the biblical text. II. Discretion versus Intense Curiosity Another example illustrating the difference between TJ and the TTs is the translation of Chapter 1 in Ezekiel, known as Ma'aseh Merkavah, and Zech. 9,15: "The Lord of Hosts will protect them" the phrase is rendered liter ally. Cited from M. Goshen-Gottstein, The Bible in the Syropalestinian Version, I, Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 1973, ad loc. 12 The TT is from MS Reuchlinianus 3; for a facsimile see A. Sperber, Codex Reuchlinianus Mo. 3 of the Badisch iMndesbiblwthek in Karlsruhe, Copenhagen: Ejnar Munksgaard, 1956. The addition appears as a marginal gloss, with the comment that it was taken from the Jerusalem Targum (Heb. Targ&lt;um&gt; Yerush&lt;almi&gt;). 13 See the copious material provided by Margaliyot, Mal'akhei 'Elyon, 108-135; for references in Second Temple period literature see OT Pseudepigrapha (Charlesworth ed.), Index, s.v. "Michael." 14 MS Gaster 1478, The John Rylands University Library of Manchester. 15 See MS Reuchlin. 3 (supra, n. 12), in a marginal gloss. 16 Margaliyot, op. cit., 21-44; OT Pseudepigrapha (Charlesworth ed.), Index, s.v. "Gabriel."</page><page sequence="6">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS 173 which describes in some detail the beasts bearing God's throne in Ezekiel's vision. The details touch upon several aspects of the vision: the number of beasts (four); the number of heads and wings of each beast (also four); the shape of their feet (rigid, like a calf's foot); and their faces, each made up of the faces of four different animals—man, lion, ox and eagle. The prophet also describes how the beasts moved as a group and their appearance, like burning fire (Ezek. 1,5-13). He further describes the wheels that moved the beasts (w. 15-21). The entire scene is the basis for descriptions of the Merkavah, the Heavenly Chariot, in post-biblical literature. How do the Aramaic translations treat this chapter? TJ in fact departs in some verses from strict adherence to the text. It accurately describes the place and time of the vision (v. 1); it some what expands the account of v. 6, stating that each beast had sixteen faces and sixteen wings, the total of all faces of the four beasts being sixty-four, which is also the total number of wings; it also notes the function of the hands below their wings (v. 8). The mission of the beasts is described at length (v. 14), as is their reaction when the Lord addresses His prophets (v. 25). In addition, TJ explains the biblical comparison of the sound of the beasts' wings to "a tumult like the din of an army" (v. 24) as referring to the beasts' voices (?) uttering God's praises, and to the voices of "the camp of angels on high." No further details are provided in TJ of the beasts' appearance beyond the original biblical text. The translation does not fill out our knowledge of the beasts' limbs (except for their legs, wings, hands and faces, which are described in the text itself), or of their sizes or the sizes of their limbs. TJ's primary concern is to explain the text; as far as the mystical aspects of the description are concerned, the translator displays considerable reserve. The TTs to Ezek. 1,1, however, are less concerned with explana tion than they are with the mystical message of the text. However, far from painting a uniform picture, they represent several different shades of interest. One TT to the verse that exhibits a distinct mystical bent may be found in MS Gaster 1478.17 In fact, this translation devotes itself to describing all the supernal worlds, one by one. It first describes the seven firmaments, the extent of each and the distance between con secutive firmaments. The seven firmaments are listed as vilon, reqi'a, " See above, η. 14.</page><page sequence="7">174 RIMMON KASHER shehaqim, zevul, ma'on, makhon, caravot',ls the extent of each firmament is five hundred days' march, and that is also the distance between every two firmaments.19 There follows a very long description of the beasts' limbs, fourteen (!) in number,20 from hooves to horns. The list is as follows: hoof, ankle, shin, thigh, knee, side (?), buttocks, back, waist, arm, shoulder, neck, head, horn. The translator then goes on to add the dimensions of each and every limb, stating that the size of each limb is the composite sum of the distance from the earth to the heavens (= 500 days' march) + the total extent of the seven firmaments (including the thickness of the firmaments and the distances between them) + the sum of heights of all the previous limbs. And these details are set out separately for each limb! Once the account of the beasts has been completed, the TT adds various other details: the extent of the 800 firmaments above which stands the Lord's throne; and the responsibility of the angel Metatron for these firmaments. The detailed account ends with the interesting comment that God's praise is so great that "his servants and the angels of the heavens cannot know and utter his praises"! But the mystical curiosity does not end there. The text goes on to mention "light-[footed] angels of wrath," who take sinners down to Ge hinnom, heap fire and sulfur upon them and rebuke them for their misdeeds. In addition, describing the fate of Sennacherib and Nebu chadnezzar in Gehinnom, the Targum identifies Gabriel as the angel who smote the Assyrian camp (2 Kgs. 19,35). In sum, the TT in question paints a colorful picture of the upper worlds: it describes the seven firmaments and lists their extent, as well as the beasts' fourteen limbs and the sizes of those limbs; it tells of the "angels of wrath" and the angels Gabriel and Metatron. Before we compare this TT to TJ and to the TT for Josh. 4-5, we must note that it exists in several versions. The version just described is the longest, all the others being considerably shorter.21 The main 18 Similarly in the Babylonian Talmud, Hagigah 12b; Avot de-R. JVatati, Version A, 37 (Schechter ed. p. 110); Vayiqra Rabba 29,11 (Margulies ed., p. 680); Pesiqta de-Rav Kahana 23,10 (Mandelbaum ed., p. 343); Midrash Tehillim 114 (Buber ed., p. 471); Seder Ma'aseh Bereshit, in Wertheimer, Battel Midrashot'1 I, pp. 29, 38-43, 367; Midrash ha-Gadol Gen. 1,1 (Margulies ed., pp. 15, 18); Midrash 'Aseret ha-Dibberot (Jellinek, Bet ha-Midrash I, p. 64). 19 Cf. Hagigah 12b; Jerusalem Talmud, Berakhot 9,1 (13a). 20 I have found no parallel to this long list. 21 All (!) the manuscripts I have been able to locate which include TTs to Ezek. 1,1 in the short version are of Yemenite origin.</page><page sequence="8">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS 175 difference is that the short versions are very brief in their descriptions of the beasts' limbs: beginning with the size of the lowest limb—the ankle—they then state that all the other limbs are of the same size. Moreover, the number of limbs is smaller: eight or even less. To my mind, these differences betray a definite tendency to restrict attention to the beasts of the Chariot as far as possible. A similar tendency may be discerned in Midrash Tanhuma, Terumah 9: "And the hooves of the beasts were five hundred years and fifteen years march. There is no need to measure anything higher than the beasts' hooves." While the Buber ed. on Terumah 8 (p. 93) does not even refer to the size of the hooves: "There is no need to measure the beasts' hooves." Perhaps the TTs' evasion of a detailed specification of the beasts' limbs should be attributed not to a desire for abbreviation but to a certain reticence concerning the Heavenly Chariot. At the same time, however, these very same short versions refer to vast hosts of angels ("a thousand thousands and a myriad myriads"— cf. Dan. 7,10) surrounding the Throne: "angels of fire" and "angels of wrath." Here, too, we are told of the vast dimensions of the angels: ". . . as from the height of the earth to the height of the heavens." Clearly, then, mystical curiosity is not abated even in these short ver sions; reticence is exercised, however, with respect to discussion of the Chariot. A comparison of TJ with the TTs to Ezek. 1,1 reveal a consider able difference. As we have seen, TJ does not depart from the bibli cal account, neither does it add details. The TTs, on the other hand— all versions—add a great variety of details found neither in the Bible nor in TJ. While the biblical text does make some reference to the number of limbs, it says nothing whatsoever of their vast sizes, and neither is there any hint to that effect in TJ. No other heavenly crea tures are mentioned: neither Metatron nor Gabriel appears; the different angelic hosts mentioned in the TTs—the "angels of wrath" and "angels of fire" are unparalleled in the Bible or in TJ; and the tremendous number of angels is an innovation of the TTs. Yet another difference between TJ and the (long version of the) TT is their attitude to the angelic songs of praise. One of the classical roles assigned to angels in the literature of angelology is to sing God's praises.22 Accordingly, TJ refers to the beasts(?) in such terms in Ezek. 1,24: 22 For angels' praise of God see Newsom, Songs, 29-30.</page><page sequence="9">176 RIMMON KASHER "The sound of their speech as they give thanks and bless their living Sovereign, the King of the Worlds. . . ,"23 In the TT to Ezek. 1,1, how ever, the angelic bands grouped around the Throne are incapable of uttering praise: "His servants and the heavenly angels cannot know or utter His praise, for their eyes cannot see, nor their ears hear." God's greatness is such that even angels cannot apprehend it. Such limita tions on the angels' powers of perception may be found in the tan naitic literature. For example, the Sifra to Lev. 2,1 (Finkelstein ed., p. 18) reports a dispute between R. Akiva and R. Simeon bar Azzai concerning the subject of the verse "You cannot see My face, for man may not see Me and live" (Ex. 33,20): Rabbi Akiva said: . . . Even the beasts who bear [the Throne] do not see the Glory. Said Simeon bar Azzai: I do not come to dispute my Master's words, only to add to them: . . . Even the ministering angels, who are immortal, do not see the Glory. The same dispute, but with interesting variations, is found in Sifrei Numbers 103 (Horovitz ed., p. 101). For our purposes, the interesting element in that source is a statement of R. Eleazar son of R. Jose: "Not that they do not see; but they even do not know His place. . . We have here evidence of a relatively early concept (late 2nd century C.E.), which limits the angels' powers of perception. This would seem to clash with much of Qumran literature, which refers to angels, inter alia, in terms derived in various ways from the verb "to know": "Known of the Worlds," "those who know the mysteries of. . . Purity," "the Knowers," "illuminators of knowledge," "spirits of knowledge and intelli gence," and so on. Finally, comparing the TTs to Ezek. 1,1 with the TT to Josh. 4-5, we find both texts describing the celestial creatures as possessing vast dimensions. Both identify the angels by name: Joshua's angel is Uriel, while the TT to Ezekiel (long version) names the angel who smote the Assyrian camp as Gabriel. III. Earthly versus Angelological Exegesis. The Angelic Order We have already seen that TJ tends to avoid references to angels as far as possible. Even where the Bible actually uses the word maFakh, 23 Cf. TJ to Ezek. 3,12, where, however, the text does not disclose the identity of those uttering praise.</page><page sequence="10">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS 177 "angel," or where the text otherwise suggests an association with angels, the translation is not faithful to the text but renders it differently. The TTs, on the other hand, rise to the occasion, as it were, and follow their usual inclinations. A good example is provided by the different translations of Is. 33,7:24 MT Behold, their valiant ones (? Heb.: 'r'lm) cry out TJ Behold, when You reveal Yourself25 to them, the emissaries of the nations will cry out bitterly TT Behold, when I revealed Myself to Abraham . . . And after that I told him to offer him up as a burnt-offering . . . Then rose all the heavenly angels, angels offear, angels of trembling, and cried outside their enclosure and said . . . MT The ambassadors (Heb. mal'akhei) of peace weep bitterly TJ (Those) who went to proclaim peace began once again to weep bitterly TT And even the angels of peace who stand in the camp of the Shekhinah weep bitterly . . . Whatever the meaning of this difficult verse, and whatever the pos sible readings,26 the difference between TJ and the TT is obvious. The former pictures the text in earthly terms: the Hebrew mal'akhei shalom is translated "emissaries."27 The picture traced by the TT, on the other hand, pertains entirely to the upper worlds. The Hebrew 'r'lm (v.l.: 'r'lym) is considered as a generic term for angels,28 and is therefore ren dered in Aramaic by the general term 'ngly mrwm', "heavenly angels."29 The translation goes on to identify these angels as belonging to two more specific groups: "angels of fear" and "angels of trembling,"30 on 24 The TT is a marginal gloss in MS Reuchlinianus 3, with the indication that it was extracted from Targ&lt;um&gt; Terush&lt;almi&gt;. 25 Aram. Ugly; v.l.: 3tgly = I shall reveal Myself. 26 Some medieval Hebrew manuscripts read 3r3lym (in the plural); lQIsa reads V Im (= I shall show them?). 27 The Aramaic word used here, 'zgd, belongs to the earthly, human world, being the term usually employed in the Targums to Prophets for flesh-and-blood messengers. Cf., e.g., TJ to Is. 14,32; 18,2; 30,4; 37,9. 28 For this term and its occurrences see S.M. Olyan, A Thousand Thousands Served Him (TSAf 36), Tübingen: J.C. Möhr, 1993, 52-53. 29 This phrase is also common in the Targums to the Hagiographa. See Ps. 50,4.6; 97,6; Job 15,15; 20,27; Second Targum to Esth. 6,1; 1 Chr. 16,31. In all these cases, with the exception of the Targum to Esther, the phrase is the translation of (ha-)shama)&gt;im, "heaven." 30 This identification is presumably based on the derivation of the word 3r3lm from the root yr3\ cf. LXX ad loc.</page><page sequence="11">178 RIMMON KASHER the one hand, and "angels of peace," on the other. TJ also resorts to groups of angels in its explanation for 1 Kgs. 19,11-12. This passage describes God's revelation to Elijah on Mount Horeb in a rather unusual way, and that is probably why TJ saw fit to introduce angelic camps: "the camp of angels of wind," "the camp of angels of fear," "the camp of angels of fire." Some of these groups are also mentioned in TTs to Is. 33,7 ("angels of fear") and Ezek. 1,1 ("heavenly angels," "angels of fire"). Nevertheless, there is a slight difference between TJ and the TTs. While the latter employ phrases whose opening word is "angels," TJ essentially refers not directly to angels but to angelic "camps," using the Aramaic word msryt\ The explanation for this distinction may lie in an overall conception of the angelic order. The term mahaneh, "camp," is generally used in the Bible in a military context, whether in the sense of a camp proper (of some armed force or host) or in the wider sense of an army or host itself.31 Indeed, Qumranic references to angels describe an angelic order par alleling that of the Qumran sect itself, phrased in military terms bor rowed from the biblical account of the Children of Israel in the desert, such as mahaneh, degel. or piqqud.32 It seems not inconceivable that such use of the word msryt3 indicates TJ's conception of the angels as orga nized along military lines. If so, it seems rather curious that TJ to Josh. 5,14-15 does not render the phrase "captain of the Lord's host" liter ally (see above) and moreover does not translate the phrases "Lord of Hosts" or "God of Hosts" at all. Conversely, the absence of the word msryt' in angelic references in the TTs may perhaps hint at a different notion of the angelic order. At the same time, the TTs do seem to refer to different groups of angels (and individual angels) as possessing different status. Thus, the TT to Is. 33,7 cited above mentions at least three groups. Two of them—"angels of fear" and "angels of trembling"—are said to be "out side their enclosure", while one—"angels of peace" is in the "camp of the Shekhinah." These statements may be associated with a saying attributed to the Palestinian amora R. Johanan (3rd century C.E.): "Only angels of peace and angels of mercy stand before the Holy One, blessed be He, but the angels of wrath are distant from Him."33 However, the basic idea of the TT to Ezek. 1,1 (brief version) seems different, as it 31 See BDB 334a. 32 Cf. Newsom, Songs, 29. 33 Tanhuma, "Tazria"' 11 (Buber ed., p. 39).</page><page sequence="12">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS 179 refers to "angels of fire" and "angels of wrath" close to the Divine Throne. Up to this point we have mentioned four individual angels by name: Uriel, Michael, Gabriel (later we shall also refer to Penuel) and Metatron. Of these, only the last-named is described (in the TT to Ezek. 1,1) by the phrase "the Great Prince of Israel." Thus the TT preserves a well known (late) tradition according to which Metatron is the most impor tant angel.34 IV. Disputes and Battles Among Angels and With Angels TJ's tendency to minimize attention to the angelic world implies, naturally, that it never mentions any kind of conflict among the super nal creatures or any threat to their existence. The TTs, however, are less reticent on this subject. (1) A very cautious reference to a conflict, possibly only a discus sion, among angels may be found in the TT to 1 Sam. 17,42.35 The Targum is concerned here with the dialogue between David and Goliath. After the dialogue a quarrel breaks out among five stones, each claim ing the privilege of being chosen to slay the Philistine giant. The stones are named for Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses and Aaron. Simultaneously with the dispute among the stones, a consultation takes place in heaven: Thereupon David raised his eyes to the heavens and saw angels taking counsel against Goliath the Philistine. Thereupon Aaron's stone was viewed with favor by the Lord. The motif of angelic counsel is unique to this fragment. In Midrash Samuel 21,1 (Buber ed., p. 108) the disputants are Aaron and God: "Aaron said: Am I not the blood-avenger? It is my task to take retri bution against him! Said the Holy One, blessed be He: On the con trary, he has blasphemed and reviled before me! It is my task to take retribution against him!" In a variant of this midrash, cited in David Kimhi's commentary ad loc., the three Patriarchs also intervene, on the grounds that Goliath "blasphemed and reviled the ranks of the living 34 For Metatron's position see Margaliyot, Mal'akhei cEly on, 91-107; H. Odeberg, 3 Enoch or the Hebrew Book of Enoch, repr. with a prolegomenon by J. Greenfield, New York: KTAV, 1973, xxx-xxxii, 79-146. 35 Quoted from MS Munich 5. The same TT exists in other MSS: Jew's College, Montefiore Collection 7 (H. 116); MS Madrid, National Library 7542; MS Salamanca, University Library 1; also in the Leiria ed. of Former Prophets (1494).</page><page sequence="13">180 RIMMON KASHER God (= Israel)." As against these midrashic traditions, the TT proba bly preserves a tradition of a similar argument in the heavens—possi bly over which angel would slay Goliath36 or which stone would be chosen by lot. One should note the midrashic tradition cited in Aggadat Bereshit 51 (Buber ed., pp. 102-103), according to which "the angel of Satan" assisted Goliath, whereas the "ministering angels" helped the Israelites.37 (2) In a TT to 2 Sam. 21,1738 we find a lengthy account of the bat tle between David and "Ishbi benob" (sic!). This battle, too, like that of David and Goliath, is given an angelological bent; the reference, though brief, is of no little interest: Thereupon David once again raised his eyes to the heavens and saw, and behold, the angel (Aram, 'ysr') of Israel and the angel of the Philistines were fighting one another. The motif of the angel, or genius,39 of Israel battling the angel of the Philistines may already be found in the book of Daniel (10,13.20), and it was well developed in Qumranic literature, particularly in the War Scroll.40 It should be noted that this was no argument or verbal dis pute, but a battle in all earnest. This example, therefore, repeats the motif already referred to in the previous example: whatever happens in the lower worlds has its counterpart in the supernal worlds. (3) A TT to Is. 57,1541 renders a lengthy description of a verbal argument between the angels Michael and Samael. The argument, said 36 Cf. Pseudo-Philo 61,5, where God sends the angel Zervihel to help fight Goliath. 37 Cf. the comment of Evelin van Staalduine-Sulman, "The Aramaic Song of the Lamb," in J.C. de Moor &amp; W.G.E. Watson (eds.), Verse in Ancient Near Eastern Prose, Neukirchen: Neukirchen Verlage, 1993, 279: ". . . the poem does not only describe the struggle between David and Goliath, but also the on-going struggle between the forces of good and evil, of God and his adversaries." And see our second example below. 38 Quoted from MS Gaster 1478, The John Rylands University Library of Manchester. Part of this MS was published by Gaster himself in £DMG 62 (1908), 528-530. 39 The literal meaning of the word 'ysr' is "prince, lord," but it is commonly used in angelological contexts. Cf. Bab. Talmud, Yoma 77a: "Dubiel, the 'ysr' of the Persians" (as in MS Munich); Pesahim 111b: "The 'ysr' of sustenance is called Cleanliness, the 'ysr' of poverty is called Filth." The word appears in similar contexts in Aramaic mag ical texts; cf. C.D. Isbell, Corpus of the Aramaic Incantation Bowls, Missoula: Scholars Press, 1975, text 49,11: "Metatron, The Great Prince ('ysr' rabba) of his Throne"; text 56,12 13: "Metatron, The Great Prince {'ysr' rabba) of the entire universe. . . .

Finally, God Himself declares that Michael has gained the upper hand: Said the Supreme One to Michael: All power to you, for you have over come Satan with the utterance of your mouth. (4) The prophet Zechariah has a vision in which Joshua, the High Priest, appears before a heavenly tribunal with the participation of the angel of the Lord, Satan and the Lord Himself (Zech. 3,Iff). Though both the biblical text and the various Targums describe a heated dis pute between Satan (in some Aramaic translations: the Accuser) and God, the Targums describe Satan in different ways:43 (3.1) MT Joshua, . . . standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan stand ing at his right to accuse him. TJ Joshua, . . . standing before the angel of the Lord, and the Subverter (Aram, fit') standing at his right to accuse him TT Joshua, . . . standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan (Aram. stn') standing at his right to accuse him (3.2) MT And the Lord said to Satan, "The Lord rebuke you, Ο Satan!" TJ And the Lord said to the Subverter, "The Lord rebuke you, Ο Subverter!" TT And the Lord said to Satan, "The Lord rebuke (the) Satan!" Why did TJ avoid the simple translation satan — stn . instead using the word hf, hfh or yhf? One explanation that has been suggested points to the idea (Bab. Talmud Bava Batra 16a) that Satan "descends (from Heaven to Earth) and leads astray, and ascends (from Earth to Heaven) and prosecutes, obtains permission and takes the soul [= kills]." The important point for TJ was not the demonic force ascribed to Satan, 42 Is. 57,14-58,14 is the Haftarah for the Day of Atonement (Morning Service) accord ing to most rites. The motif of an angelic debate may also be found in the midrashic literature. See, e.g., Tanhuma, Deuteronomy 10—a brief account of a dispute between the angels of the twelve tribes and the angel of Esau; the outcome indicates the win ner in the upper and lower worlds. 43 Quoted from MS Parma, Palatine Library 555 (de Rossi 1854). The TT also exists in other MSS, with many variations: Oxford, Bodl. 68-69; MS Berlin, the National Library 1; MS London 187; MS Madrid, University Library 116-Z-39; MS Salamanca, University Library 3; MS Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale 75.</page><page sequence="15">182 RIMMON KASHER but his task, i.e., to subvert and accuse; hence the use of hf.u A similar understanding of Satan may be found in the TT to Is. 57,15 (above, example 3), where Samael (= Satan) is indeed described as an accuser. However, the TT to Zech. 3,1-2 is bold enough to con sider Satan part of God's heavenly retinue, both because of the bibli cal account here and because of Satan's role in Job chaps. 1-2.43 It therefore explicitly refers to the Accuser by his name, Satan. (5) The last example in this section is rather different, both formally speaking and in substance. The different versions of the TT to Ezek. 1,1 incoiporate a passage which refers to Nebuchadnezzar's hubris on the basis of Is. 14,12-14, where helel ben shahar, "The Shining One, Son of Dawn," is described as desiring to rule the upper regions. The pas sage in question, cited below in a few versions, refers to v. 13: MT I will ascend to the sky TJ I will ascend to the height TT46 I will ascend to the very uppermost heavens and destroy the upper residences and battle the supreme holy ones TT47 I will ascend to the highest heavens and destroy . . . TT48 I will ascend to the uppermost heavens and destroy the residences of the upper regions MT Higher than the stars of God will I set my throne TJ Higher than the people of God will I set my royal throne TT46 And I will set my royal throne higher than the throne on high TT47 And I will set my royal throne (Aram, kuursy mlkwty dyly) higher than the Cherubim TT48 And I will set my royal throne (Aram, kwrsy mlkwty) higher than the Cherubim There is no doubt that this passage is indeed a translation-interpreta tion of Is. 14,13.49 In content it goes far beyond the biblical text, which in itself uses quite bold imagery. The "stars of God" are interpreted as alluding to God's throne (or even thrones, in the plural, cf. Dan. 7,9) or to the Cherubim. Moreover, while the Bible describes the "Shining One" as aspiring to emulate God, the Targum has Nebuchadnezzar 44 Cf. Smolar-Aberbach, Studies, 225. 45 Similarly the Targums to the Hagiographa, e.g., Ps. 109,6; Job chaps. 1-2; 1 Chr. 21,1. 46 MS Gaster 1478. 47 MS New York, JTS L260A. 48 MS Bar-Ilan University 737. 49 Cf.

Mohr, 1988, 280.</page><page sequence="16">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS 183 boasting of his ability to destroy the upper regions and attack "the holy ones of the Most High"—presumably also to defeat them. The motif of batde with the heavenly "holy ones" is borrowed from Dan. 7,18 + 21-22.25, where the text is concerned with the war of the fourth beast against the holy ones. The TT to Ezek. 1,1, which does not hesitate to refer in detailed terms to the supernal worlds (above, sec. II), also renders a bold account of Nebuchadnezzar's ambition to achieve victory over the upper worlds. TJ, on the other hand, never eager to give such descriptions, is seem ingly averse even to ascribe such thoughts to Nebuchadnezzar. Wherever it can suggest a different interpretation, referring to earthly events, it deviates from a literal translation in order to do so. Hence the text is explained as referring to the Babylonian monarch's desire to rule not over the upper regions but over the earth, i.e., over the people of Israel. Even v. 14, which explicitly quotes the "Shining One" as say ing, "I will mount the back of a cloud, I will match the Most High," is interpreted in TJ metaphorically, placing the greatest possible dis tance between the text and the picture of the supernal world: "I will ascend higher than any nation, I will be above all of them!" It is not surprising, therefore, that TJ translates Is. 24,21, which explicitly refers to war in the heavens: "In that day the Lord will pun ish the host of heaven in heaven," in such a way as to avoid all ref erence to mythological pictures painted in the Bible or to the super nal worlds: "And it shall come to pass, at that time the Lord will visit [his wrath?] upon the mighty hosts who dwell in might." Similarly, it was probably a reluctance to describe conflict in the heavenly retinue that brought TJ to avoid ascribing any "fall" or "sin" to angels. Thus, the mythic account of the sinning cherub in Ezek. 24,14-16 receives an exclusively historical interpretation, aimed only at the king of Tyre and omitting any mention of a "cherub." V. Introduction of Angels Unmentioned in the Biblical Text In this, the final section of our study of the attitude of the Targums to Prophets to angels, we wish to consider an interesting feature of the Targums, which may be explained in two ways. There are cases in which, although the biblical text has nothing whatever to do with the angelic world, the Targums—both TJ and TTs—nevertheless introduce angels. There is apparently no single explanation for this phenomenon; it may be attributed to two different tendencies—first, the desire to</page><page sequence="17">184 RIMMON RASHER avoid anthropomorphism; and, second, a tendency to favor midrashic exegesis and a predilection for the supernatural. A. Introduction of an "Angel" to Avoid Anthropomorphism In several passages, TJ introduces an angel where the Bible itself refers directly to God. This may be done, for example, when the verb root ys\ "to go out, emerge," is applied to God. Though TJ some times renders this as 'tgly, "to be revealed,"30 it occasionally changes the subject of the verb to an angel. Thus, TJ translates Judg. 4,14, "Does not the Lord go out before you?" as "Does not the angel of the Lord go out to insure success before you?" Similarly, TJ to 2 Sam. 5,25, "For the Lord will go out before you," as "For the angel of the Lord will go out to prosper before you."Dl Smolar and Aberbach were most probably right to attribute such cases to TJ's policy of avoiding anthropomorphism.52 The same tendency is evident in a TT to Josh. 10,41.53 This verse refers to the meeting of Pharaoh (in the Bible: Abimelech!) and Sarah, as related in Gen. 20. Among other things, the TT states that Pharaoh was rebuked, even punished, by an angel of the Lord, for having taken Abraham's wife Sarah: "And he was rebuked on her account by an angel of the Lord." As the verb "rebuked" is derived from the root ykh, this is no doubt a translation-interpretation of the word vue-nokhahat (Gen. 20,16; generally translated into English as "you are righted" or "you are cleared"), from the same root. In the biblical story, God Himself appears to Abimelech king of Gerar (ib. w. 3, 6). The Pentateuch Targums replace "God" by mymr', "word" (TO ad v. 3, v.l. in Samari tan translation; Neofiti to both verses), or by the letters YWY (TO to v. 6). A tradition similar to that of the TT is transmitted in Bereshit Rabba 40,2 (Theodor-Albeck ed., p. 389) in the name of the Palestinian amora R. Levi: "All that night the angel stood over him holding a whip." Further detail is furnished in the midrash Tanhuma, Lekh-Lekha 8 (Buber ed., p. 66): "Thereupon the angel came down from heaven holding a rod. ..." It would seem that both the TT and the midrashic 50 E.g.: TJ to Judg. 5,4; Is. 26,21; Mic. 1,3. And cf. the Targums to Ex. 11,4. 51 MS London 187 (Sperber's sigla: a) reads "the Lord," more in keeping with a lit eral rendition. I shall discuss the literal translations of Prophets elsewhere. 52 Smolar-Aberbach, Studies, 225. 53 MS Reuchlinianus 3; the TT in question is a marginal gloss, accompanied by the comment that it was taken from &lt;Targum&gt; Yerush&lt;almi&gt;.</page><page sequence="18">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS 185 sources introduce the angel in order to distance human beings from direct contact with God. A similar trend may be discerned already in lQGenAp XX, 16-17, but there the agent of punishment is not an angel but "a pestilential wind" or "a wind that was evil." B. Introduction of Angels due to Midrashic Exegesis In addition to the examples considered previously, one can cite fur ther instances of references to angels incorporated in TTs where the biblical text itself involves no such reference. The tendency to ascribe activity to angels, on the one hand, and midrashic exegesis, on the other, may be responsible for the appearance of angels in the follow ing examples. (1) According to the TT to 1 Sam. 4,12,D4 an angel sent Saul to inform Eli of Israel's defeat: And Saul son of Kish, a Benjaminite, ran from the battlefield and came to Shiloh that day, by means of an angel who helped him run from there Sources parallel to this fragment, which indeed identify the "Benjaminite" of the biblical text with Saul, state that Saul was "light-footed."55 Our TT, however, proposes a supernatural explanation for the speed with which Saul reached Shiloh from the battlefield, involving the miracu lous intervention of an angel. (2) According to the TT to 1 Kgs. 1,1,56 one reason that David "never felt warm" was that, once he had seen the Angel of Death - see 2 Sam. 24 (= 1 Chr. 21)—his body continued to tremble: . . . because of the great fear and much trembling that seized him when he saw the Angel of Death standing between heaven and earth, his drawn sword in his hand . . . His appearance was terrible, his voice fearful, ter ror and fear were upon his face . . . Fear seized upon him . . . Terror and amazement entered him, all his bones broke and all his limbs trembled The biblical text attributes David's condition to natural causes: "King David was now old, advanced in years; and though they covered him with bedclothes, he never felt warm," and TJ translates accordingly. &gt;4 MS Reuchlinianus 3; the TT in question is a marginal gloss, accompanied by the comment that it was taken from "another book" (sef&lt;er&gt; ah&lt;er&gt;). 50 Pseudo-Philo 54,4; Midrash Samuel 11,1 (BX ed., pp. 78-79); Midrash Psalms 7,2 (Buber ed., p. 63). j6 Quoted here from MS Salamanca, University Library 1. Parallel sources: MS Munich 5; Genizah fragment, Cambridge, T.-S. Β 12.5.</page><page sequence="19">186 RIMMON KASHER The TT in question, however, associates David's condition with an exceptional, even supernatural event in his past—the very sight of the Angel of Death had a lasting effect on his physical well-being.57 (3) Is. 21,5, part of the prophecy of "the Desert of the Sea,"58 seems to be a call to prepare for war. Among other things, it calls upon the princes/officers (sanrti) to "grease the shields." TJ translates the phrase literally, rendering sawn as rbrby' — "great ones, princes."59 The TT to this verse,60 however, understands the call as aimed at the angels: Rise up, 0 Michael and Gabriel, the two Great Ones, take revenge from the kingdom of Babylon and give the kingship to Cyrus and Darius, the kings of Persia and Media We shall not be far wrong if we consider the TT as expanding and interpreting the Targumic tradition found in TJ ad loc., according to which sanm — rbrby'. But it is doing so in its own special way: influenced by repeated references to the angelic world, it only naturally identifies the "great ones" with Michael and Gabriel, who are frequently called sanm in Jewish literature.61 Moreover, it refers to this pair of angels62 as intervening in historical events: they are responsible for removing Babylon from the stage and raising up Persia and Media. In addition, the Targum actually appeals to the angels—a rare feature in the TTs to Prophets, though the fact that the verse is ostensibly spoken by God somewhat mitigates the boldness of the interpretation. (4) The TT to Ezek. 37,763 refers inter alia to the angel who defeated the king of Babylon: Just at the time the prophet was prophesying about them, Belshazzar the king was drinking from them, and the angel struck that evil man on his mouth 57 Farther on the TT proposes another explanation: David's chills were a punish ment for the disrespect he showed for clothing when he cut off the corner of Saul's cloak (1 Sam. 24,4-5). 58 There are many different explanations of this phrase. According to w. 6 and 9 the prophecy is concerned with the defeat of Babylon by Elam and Media. 59 Aram, rbrby' is a common translation for Heb. sanm; cf. TJ to Is. 19,11.13; 23,8; 30,4; 31,9; 34,12; 43,28; 49,7. 60 MS Reuchlinianus 3; the TT in question is a marginal gloss, accompanied by the comment that it was taken from Targ&lt;um&gt; Terush&lt;almi&gt;. 61 The source of the term is Dan. 10,13.21; 12,1. 62 Michael and Gabriel are frequently mentioned together, as a pair, in post-biblical sources. 6:1 Quoted from a Pentateuch, ed. Salonika 1513. First published by A. Diez Macho, Biblica 39 (1958), 198-205.</page><page sequence="20">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS 187 This event is not mentioned in the Bible, though a partial parallel may be found in the Babylonian Talmud (Sanhedrin 92b). (5) According to the TT to Hos. 12,4,64 the "man" who wrestled with Jacob is identified with an angel, who is even named; the pas sage is part of Jacob's prayer to God to save him from Esau: Deliver me, 1 pray, from the hand of my brother—as You delivered me from (his)63 angel Penuel. The notion that the man who wrestled with Jacob was an angel is no innovation of this TT; it is paralleled in the Palestinian Targu mim to Gen. 32,24-25.29;66 Neofiti ad loc. even identifies the angel as Sariel.67 If the TT is indeed alluding to Jacob's struggle with the "man," rather than explaining the name Peniel/Penuel given to the site of the encounter (w. 31, 32), it constitutes a hitherto unknown tradition con cerning the identity of the man/angel. Here, too, the TT reflects the notion that any anonymous figure should be identified. (6) The TT to 1 Kgs. 19,1068 lists the (twelve) miracles that hap pened to Phinehas when he stabbed Zimri and Cozbi. One of the mir acles occurred when the Angel of Death, seeing Phinehas, stopped killing the Children of Israel: The twelfth miracle: When the Angel of Death saw him, the plague against the Israelites was halted. The biblical story of the plague (Numbers 25) says nothing of any an gelic involvement. Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to v. 8, which lists twelve (other) miracles, does indeed refer to an angel, but in a completely different context (the tenth miracle: "An angel came and inverted the 64 MS Jerusalem 4° 5 7 7.49, published by Y. Komlos, Sinai 50 (1958), 475-476. 65 The MS reads "his angel" (ml'kyti); possibly this should be emended to ml'kh, "the angel." For the role of the angel Penuel see Olyan, Thousand Thousands, 108-109. 66 For a discussion of these Targumim see Goshen-Gottstein, Fragments of Lost Targumim, I, 49. 67 A midrash on the phrase "for you have striven (Heb. santa) with God and men" in v. 29. Other sources suggest different identifications of the man/angel: Uriel, Gabriel, Michael, Metatron, Israel, or the angel of Esau. For the different traditions see J.Z. Smith, "The Prayer of Joseph," inj. Neusner (ed.), Religions in Antiquity (E.R. Goodenough Festschrift), Leiden: Brill, 1968, 277-281; idem, "Prayer of Joseph," in OT Pseudepigrapha (Charlesworth ed.), II, 707-709. 68 MS Jerusalem 4° 5 7 7.49, published by Y.

The TT under discussion seems to reflect an exegetical-translational con cept explaining the "plague" (v. 8) as the result of the Angel of Death's intervention; it would thus be ideological related to the TT to 1 Kgs. 1,1 (above, example 2), to Pseudo-Jonathan to Ex. 12,13.24 (mashhit — "Angel of Death'VAngel of Destruction") and to Pseudo-Jonathan's expansive paraphrase of Deut. 9,19, concerning the punishment of the worshipers of the golden calf: "At that time, five angels of destruction were sent by the Lord to destroy Israel. . . ." Summaiy and Conclusions Our goal was to try and examine the degree to which the different Targums to the books of the Prophets—Targum Jonathan and the Toseftot Targum—do or do not represent a unified attitude to angels and the angelic world. There is no doubt that both TJ and the TTs take the existence of angels for granted; but it is equally clear that TJ adopts a more cautious, reserved, approach than the TTs. Indeed, the TTs are intensely curious about the supernal world. Despite the fact that they derive from a variety of sources and differ quite widely in their language and function, it is undeniable that fifteen of them dis play such an interest. Moreover, these fifteen instances constitute a rep resentative sample of the different sources and are therefore adequate to indicate a trend shared by the Toseftot Targum as a whole.69 Moreover, I would say that the difference is not one of quantity alone, but also of substance—not only is the number of references larger, but their content is quite different. Unlike TJ to Prophets, the TTs furnish us with the names of no less than seven angels: Uriel, Gabriel, Metatron, Michael, Samael, Penuel and the Angel of Death. The number of groups or categories of angels mentioned in the TTs is also greater. While TJ mentions only such groups as "angels of fire," "angels of trembling," "heavenly angels" and "angels of wind," the TTs refer to still other groups: "cruel angels," "angels of wrath," "angels of peace" and "angels of fear" (in addition to those mentioned in TJ, which also appear in TTs). And such expressions as "his attendants" (smswhy) or "officers" (srky') also occur in the TTs but not in TJ. 69 It is nevertheless worthy of note that three of the TTs quoted above—to 2 Sam. 21,17, Is. 57,15 and Ezek. 1,1 (long version)—are particularly rich in angelological mate rial, and all three come from the same manuscript.</page><page sequence="22">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS 189 Another difference between TJ and the TTs concerns the tasks assigned to the angels. Wherever the former enlarges on the biblical text, it considers angels in two roles: uttering God's praises and par ticipating in divine revelation. The TTs, however, involve the angels to a far greater degree in events on earth no less than in the heavens. Among other things, this implies the notion of the guardian angels or geniuses (sarim) of the nations and of Israel. Thus one has frequent descriptions of the angel of Israel doing battle with the angel of a foe; and Metatron is on occasion referred to as "the Great Prince (.sar) of Israel." There is no hint of these beliefs in TJ. To what can we attribute these differences? A comparison of the material in the Targums to Rabbinic literature reveals that TJ is closer to the world of the Talmudic Sages, as the latter's references to the angelic world are also always "brief and colourless, lacking mythical characteristics."'0 It is not inconceivable that TJ reflects rabbinical views of the period following the end of the 2nd century C.E., which tended to restrict the powers of angels as far as possible,71 objecting to angelic cults72 and to prayers directed toward angels.73 Where TJ nevertheless introduces angels, it is careful to call them specifically "angels of the Lord" never assigning them too independent a position.74 It seems very probable, therefore, that the recension of TJ in our possession repre sents the greatest possible consideration of the Sages' overall attitude to the angelic world. The TTs, however, represent an almost diametrically opposed atti tude—a positive view of angels and their many roles. Our knowledge of the origin of these Targums is scant, though we do have a few indi cations of their Sitz im Leben. Many of the TTs (approximately fifty percent) apply to verses which are explicitly known to be part of haftarot, some of these explain the first or last verses of haftarot, and some exist in manuscripts containing collections of haftarot with Aramaic transla tions. It is not surprising, therefore, that twelve TTs out of the fifteen 70 Ε.Ε. Urbach, The Sages—Their Concepts and Beliefs, translated by I. Abrahams, I, Jerusalem: Magnes Press, 197l2, 166. 71 Urbach, op. at., 182-183. 72 Cf. Tosefta Hullin 2,18: "Whoever slaughters [an animal] for the sun or the moon . . ., for Michael the great captain . . .—the meat is considered as if offered to the dead." 73 Cf. Jerusalem Talmud, Berakhot 9,1 (13a); Bab. Talmud, Yoraa 52a. 74 Cf. R. Kittel, TDKT, I, s.v. "άγγελος," 82, for the general Rabbinical attitude to angels.</page><page sequence="23">190 RIMMON KASHER discussed here fit the criteria just listed;75 one further TT should pos sibly be added in view of its content.76 They seem to have been part of the Targums to hafiarot and may thus attest to the instruction heard by the congregation in the synagogue—instruction, however, that was never expurgated by the Sages (as was TJ). Hence the TTs are valu able evidence of popular Jewish concepts and beliefs as they evolved in synagogues in Antiquity. While TJ reflects the "official" translation, the TTs reflect the unofficial, i.e., popular translation. Despite the aforesaid, even the TTs to Prophets are not completely unbridled in their attitude. They, too, refrain from describing the angels as independent creatures, capable of acting against God's will; angels take no part in Jewish prayer; and they are not described as beings to be worshipped or addressed. Such popular beliefs find no place even in the TTs—a fact which may indicate that they, too, were "super vised" to some extent. The relationship between TJ and the TTs resembles that between Targum Onkelos and the Palestinian Targums to the Pentateuch, on the one hand, and Pseudo-Jonathan, on the other. While the latter makes numerous references to angels,77 the other Pentateuch Targums show an attitude to the angelic world similar to that of TJ.78 To our mind, the TTs to Prophets and Pseudo-Jonathan represent the same philosophy and policy of translation-interpretation. Their philosophy is rather close to that of some apocalyptic and esoteric literature, which referred freely and frequently to angels and assigned them various tasks. However, whereas Pseudo-Jonathan refers frequently by name to angels that appear specifically in the late Jewish esoteric literature, the TTs to prophets, interestingly enough, mention only angels figuring in the early literature. Moreover, those angels actually named—Uriel, Gabriel, Michael and Penuel—are all held to be "archangels,"79 and this may be the reason for the special attention devoted to them. Nevertheless, 75 The exceptions are those to Josh. 10,41, 1 Sam. 4,12 and Is. 21,5. 76 The TT to Josh. 10,41 refers to Gen. 20; it may therefore have served as a pre liminary to the weekly portion of the Torah (in the Triennial Cycle) that began with Gen. 20,1. 77 Cf. Shinan, "The Angelology etc.," 182-191; idem, Embroidered Targum, 120-126. 78 Cf. Shinan, "The Angelology etc.," 186-187; idem, Embroidered Targum, 124-125. 79 Cf., e.g., 1 Enoch 9,1, where four angels are named: Michael, Uriel, Raphael and Gabriel; ib. 20,2 lists the seven archangels and their functions: Suru'el, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Saraqa'el, Gabriel and Ramiel; ib. 40,9: Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Phanuel; and ib. 54,6: Michael, Raphael, Gabriel, Penuel (also ib. 71,8-13). For similar refer ences in the midrashic and esoteric literature see Yadin, Scroll of the War. . ., 237-240.</page><page sequence="24">ANGELOLOGY AND THE SUPERNAL WORLDS 191 it is not impossible that the TT to Ezek. 1,1, which is replete with descriptions of supernal and hidden worlds, originated at least partly in circles of Jewish mystics.80 Whether some of the Targums to the Hagiographa also originated among these circles is a separate question that deserves special study. 80 It is not surprising that the TT in MS New York, JTS L260A is ascribed to R. Menahem Recanati—a commentator, rabbi and kabbalist of 14th century Italy. Surely it is no accident that he was probably the first author to cite whole excerpts (no less than 40 times) of Targum Pseudo-Jonathan to the Pentateuch!</page></plain_text>
