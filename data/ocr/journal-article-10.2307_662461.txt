<plain_text><page sequence="1">EARLY RELATIONS BETWEEN HOPI AND KERES By ELSIE CLEWS PARSONS THERE have been various traditions on First Mesa about early rela- tions with the western Keres. The Acoma were said to be Hopi who had learned to speak Keresan; the early language of the people who came to be referred to on First Mesa as Snake-Sand clan was said to be Keresan. It was believed that all these peoples and other Keresan-speaking people called Kawaika, "Laguna people," lived together at Toko'nabi, near the junction of the San Juan and Colorado Rivers; later, the "Acoma" settled near the spring A'miiba, below First Mesa on the east side,' and a pueblo overlooking Antelope Valley (Jeddito) was the home of the "Laguna people."2 The Snake-Sand people lived below First Mesa,3 two miles to the southwest. On the Mesa itself the Mustard clan and their Wikwa'lobi kiva were accounted Keresan, but latter day Keresan, immigrant during the trou- blous times of the Spanish invasion. Probably a trickle of Keresan immigra- tion preceded the Tewa migration at the close of the 17th century. The Tewa of Hano have kept their language, the Keres lost theirs, on a pro- longed visit, it was said, to the Navaho,4 but the reason of the loss, whether among Navaho or Hopi, was probably because the immigrant groups were quite small. These wanderers, Tewa or Keres, introduced the Butterfly dance which is the Saint's day dance of the Rio Grande. They also intro- duced the Yayatti and Poboshwymkia societies, curing societies of the Keresan type which have now lapsed among the Hopi. One guess is that this migratory stream or trickle started from Santo Domingo after it was sacked and its kivas burned5 by Otermin in 1681. It is known that after the Great Rebellion Santo Domingo irreconcilables helped settle Laguna. So much for historical or pseudo-historical tradition about Hopi-Keresan 1 Kayenta pottery has been found here (A. V. Kidder, An Introduction to the Study of Southwestern Archaeology, Andover, 1924, p. 72). 2 Kawaika, which is northeast of Awatobi, was sacked by the Spaniards in 1540. It was still occupied in 1582, but some time after that date and probably before 1598 it was abandoned. The latest date obtained here by tree ring method is 1495 (L. L. Hargrave, The Jeddito Valley and the First Pueblo Towns in Arizona to be Visited by Europeans, Museum Notes, Oct. 1935, Museum of Northern Arizona). 3 Alexander M.

What kept the tradition alive, possibly even in some particulars started it? The ceremonies. The songs of the Snake-Antelope, Flute, Wiiwiichim, Mamzrau, and Singers societies are said to be in Keresan, which only means, of course, that now and again a Keresan word is used. Of these words perhaps the most significant are Ka'toya, the horned or the two-headed mythical snake which is patron of the Antelope society,6 and chamahia, the term for the implement-weapon, the hoe-ax placed on the Hopi Antelope society altar and on the Acoma Kapina society altar. Only in Hopi opinion are these stones accounted weapons, the archaeolo- gist classifies them as hoes. All specimens' found under archaeological con- ditions come from the San Juan drainage.8 Chamahia are fetish stones, in Pueblo opinion representing warrior spirits, anthropomorphic beings of an earlier age, turned to stone.9 In the Hopi Antelope society songs these 6 Stephen, p. 716 n. 4. At Santo Domingo the mythical two-headed snake is called K'a''- DOwi (Leslie A. White, The Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico, Memoirs, American An- thropological Association, No. 43, 1935, p. 202) and at Sia the plumed serpent of the north is called Skatowe or Skatona (M. C. Stevenson, The Sia, Eleventh Annual Report, Bureau of American Ethnology, 1889-1890, pp. 69, 157). 7Most of them are made of yellow hornstone, which was quarried in the neighborhood of Four Corners. A few are of black slate. In the San Juan country they are popularly referred to as "skinning knives," but there is no justification for this identification. Although none has ever been recovered hafted, the fact that tools of mountain sheep horn of very similar shape were mounted longitudinally makes it seem likely that the stone ones were treated in the same way. The wear on the butt ends of chamahias also evidences longitudinal hafting, and the blade ends bear the unmistakable polish of use in the earth (A. V. Kidder, personal communica- tion). In this connection we may note the hoe dance sticks of First Mesa. They are somewhat more paddle-shaped than the chamahia, and are painted with the cloud-rain sign (Stephen, fig. 320). 8 Dr J. O. Brew reports finding fragments of a chamahia at Awatobi. Were the mesa towns of Antelope Valley peopled by immigrants from the San Juan drain- age during the great drought of 1276-1298? Are we on the verge of establishing a northern ori- gin for the Keres? Those ever orientating people declare that "they went to the middle south from the northwest ahead southward" (E. S. Goldfrank in American Anthropologist, Vol. 25, 1923, p. 194). 9 At Laguna ts'a'mahia, cino'haya, Tya 'tc'aiectci' were beautiful stones which stood on each side of the altars. They were human beings first, but when the earth settled they became stone (F. Boas, Keresan Texts, Publications, American Ethnological Society, Vol. 8, 1928, Pt. 1, p. 39). Shinohaiye is one of the patrons of the Kashale, an initiating impersonation (E. C. Parsons, Laguna Genealogies, Anthropological Papers, American Museum of Natural His- tory, Vol. 19, Pt. 5, 1923, p. 258 n. 2). The samahiye stone I collected at Laguna was dressed for the altar with feathers and beads. It is a rounded, conical topped stone, not a hoe (E. C. Parsons, Notes on Ceremonialism at Laguna, Anthropological Papers, American Museum of Natural History, Vol. 19, Pt. 4, 1920, p. 118, fig. 19a).</page><page sequence="3">556 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 38, 1936 beings are invoked; in Sia prayer the warrior spirits of the six directions are addressed by the same name or names.'1 In Santo Domingo a man who has four times served as war chief is given the courtesy term of Tsamahia." This term or others are far from being the only links between the Snake- Antelope of the Hopi and the Snake-Kapina (Spider) societies of the west- ern Keres. The Snake ceremony of Sia is almost a replica of the Hopi per- formance with the Kapina (Spider) society associated in altar rituals.12 The snake swallowing performance that Espejo saw at Acoma in 158213 has lapsed; today the Snake shamans make cures, but they have no altar sand painting or public ceremony.14 The altar of the Kapina society (extinct in 1926) was laid for the installation of the War chiefs and for the use of the Town chief who is prescriptively an Antelope clansman. The Kapina altar as set for the Town chief had a row of large crook prayer-sticks with animal figurines;15 as set for the War chiefs there were on the altar two feather-topped corn ear fetishes called Tsamai'ye and Tsamahia', Tsa- mai'ye on the east and Tsamahia' on the west,16 and in the middle a large stone lion. The sand painting drawn for Dr White as that of the Fire society I am strongly inclined to think is actually that of the Kapina society. It is almost a replica of the Hopi Antelope society altar painting, particularly that of the Second Mesa Shufiopovi society. The medicine drink of the Kapina chief was ground-up snake droppings in water. This medicine gave strength and the ability to dream the future."' The society gave power to men going to war."8 The Kapina society of Laguna used red stained prayer- 10 Stevenson, p. 130. 11 The Pueblo of Santo Domingo, New Mexico, p. 39. 12 Stevenson, p. 76 ff.

The extinct Kah'bena ceremony of the Tewa at Hano was derived, I believe, from the Keresan Kapina society. It was a war (also conceptually snake) ceremony, jealously guarded from Hopi neighbors. The presence of the kachina and clowns at the conclusion of the altar ceremonial is a Keresan feature (E. C. Par- sons, The Ceremonial Calendar at Tewa, American Anthropologist, Vol. 28, 1926, pp. 216- 18). Similarly, after the winter ceremonials of the Snake-Antelope and Flute societies a kachina dance is in order.</page><page sequence="4">PARSONS] HOPI AND KERES 557 sticks,19 as do the Hopi Snake-Antelope societies and war societies in gen- eral. Several other traits identify the Hopi Snake-Antelope societies as Kere- san societies. The Antelope society chief of Shipau'lovi said to Stephen: "Spider woman is my mother; she is the mother of all."20 This is the posi- tion given Spider in Keresan mythology.21 The Bear and Lion impersona- tions at the Snake initiation and the impersonations of the chiefs of the Directions (Cloud chiefs) by the Antelope chiefs are characteristically Keresan and so is the dedication of infants to the societies. Again the rites of emesis and of depositing offerings in a circuit over four days22 are char- acteristically Keresan. The Keresan society closest in function to the Hopi Flute society is the Flint society which cures for knife or war wounds, but there is nothing specific by which to identify the Flint and Flute societies. There are how- ever a few general Keresan traits in the Flute society: twofold organization (into Blue and Drab societies); observance of ceremony in a dwelling, not in kiva; representing the sky by pendent crossed sticks which are swung around during the ceremonial; finally flute playing itself which is very characteristic of the Keresan curing society. Navaho traits are suggested, too, in the Flute ceremony: notably through Locust who is proof against arrow or lightning, through the four birds on the altar and the use of bird- skins, through the four mountains of the directions.23 The Flute ceremony alternates biennially with the Snake-Antelope cere- mony. The Flute ceremony has been more or less camouflaged as a dramati- 19 Notes on Ceremonialism at Laguna, p. 118. The society controlled pigments for moc- casins, presumably the red and black, and Awl man was a patron spirit (Laguna Genealogies, p. 258 n. 2). 20 At Oraibi the Antelope chieftaincy is in the Spider clan. 21 In the Hopi Snake myth Spider woman accompanies the youth and is very helpful, as she ever is in Pueblo folktales. In Hopi myth and ritual Spider is specifically the grandmother of the War Brothers. Antelope chief, being a war chief, may have this only in mind. 22 Compare, too, the four day snake hunt, in circuit; and compare in this connection ini- tiation by trespass. If anyone encounters the Hopi snake hunters he must be initiated, just as at Acoma if anyone encounters a medicine man on the four night circuits made by societies during an initiation (Supplementary Data on Acoma). 23 The Emergence myth told Stephen by a Navaho at Keam's Canion and various variants of the Hopi Emergence myth have much in common: the reed used to ascend on; ascent by Badger and by Locust; Locust shot at by men of the Directions (i.e., Clouds); presence of Spider woman; creation of Sun and Moon through blankets and two youths; quarrel and separation of men and women; flood caused by Water serpent; ground ploughed up by Mountain Sheep to form arroyos. The grandmother and great grandmother of the Walpi Town chief, hereditarily in charge of the Flute ceremony, were married into the Navaho (Stephen, pp. 949-50, 952, 1046).</page><page sequence="5">558 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 38, 1936 zation of the reception of the Horn clan into Walpi;24 it has come clear quite recently that it is really or also a dramatization of the Hopi Emer- gence myth. The altar and standard paraphernalia point to this interpreta- tion and the esoteric night ritual at the sipapu of the Emergence together with the impersonation of Masauwu, the god of Death and Fire, the First Denizen of the upper world. In myth Locust goes up the sipapu, finds Masauwu and is shot by the lightning bolts of the Clouds. Locust, the flute player, is brave and revives. Locust is depicted playing a reed flute on the tiles on the Flute society altar and Locust was said at Oraibi to be medicine for mortal wounds and, I infer, for lightning shock. The Flute society of Walpi cures for lightning shock; arrow points which are shot by the Clouds may be gathered up only by the chief of the Flute society. One of the two Walpi Flute societies25 was in the trusteeship of the Squash or Sorrow-making clan,26 which became extinct in the 'seventies or before. The Wiiwiichim and Mamzrau chieftaincies were also in this clan; but they were handed to the Mustard and Snake clans, both having Keresan affiliations. The Sun youth patron of the Wiiwiichim society and the clowning associated with this society indicate Keresan influence. Mamzrau is affiliated with the Wiiwiichim society conceptually and ritu- ally;27 but the Mamzrau basket wrapped tiponis point to western in- fluence.28 On the whole the Keresan complex on First Mesa centres around Wi- kwa 'lobi or Watch kiva,29 around the Mustard, Squash, Snake-Sand-Lizard clans, and around the Snake-Antelope, Flute, Wiiwiichim, and Singers societies. Beetle, Locust, Snake, Bear, and Mountain Lion are spirit helpers or medicine. Taiowa, the seducer, Chakwaina, the kachina warrior maid, Child-water woman or Sand-altar woman who is Earth woman and Mother 24 This part of the ceremony is very much like the ceremonial reception of a foreign spouse into Acoma (Supplementary Data on Acoma). 2 These Blue and Drab Flute societies may have been named from the blue and drab bows of war (E. and P. Beaglehole, Hopi of the Second Mesa, Memoirs, American Anthro- pological Association, No. 44, 1935, p. 19). The Drab Flute of Oraibi were said to be named from the grey or immature locust (Fred Eggan, personal communication). 26 The name is said to be derived from inverted speech, ever associated with clowning; members of the Wiuwiichim society (also of the Singers society) are per se clown impersonators. Singers chief acts as clown chief. 27 They are called brother and sister; they both cure for "twisting sickness;" they sing taunting songs and drench and befoul one the other. 28 W. D.

Clowning is a special feature; reproduc- tion and war, the special interests. In conclusion I would mention the Hopi-like traits observable at present day Acoma as indicative of early relationships. The Acoma Kachina cult has been greatly influenced by Zufii, but the whipping of the children, boys and girls, and the performance of a single annual summer rain cere- mony are Hopi-like (Zufii and the other Keres have a series of society re- treats and kachina dances). The legend of how the Acoma Corn clan got Shuracha, the little fire god, into their clan is typically Hopi. The clan head meets Shuracha making his bonfires to heat up the Earth Mother into fecundity. "I am glad to receive you and welcome you," says the clan head. "I want you to be our head." So the kachina stayed with the Corn clan.30 That Acoma got its clan system from the Hopi is proved by the fact that the paternal aunt gives her godchild one of her clan's stock of personal names, a naming practice peculiar to the Hopi.31 Two hypotheses about Keres-Hopi relations may be advanced, from the ethnological evidence. (1) A long period-the archeologists should tell us how many centuries--before the Spanish invasion, groups from the Hopi country migrated to the territory of the western Keres, probably to Acoma. These people carried with them Snake rituals and myth, also the Hopi clanship structure. Their relationship with kindred who had remained behind was not completely seve'red, and through this line of communication the Snake rituals, moulded into Keresan society patterns, got back to the Hopi. During the Spanish invasion, another line of Keresan communica- tion started up through the Rio Grande towns. Curing societies of the out and out Keresan type were introduced at this time. Through these Keresan immigrants relations with the Navaho were carried on, and some Navaho- Keresan traits introduced into ceremonial, particularly into the Flute ceremony. (2) The second hypothesis, the Fewkes-Hargrave hypothesis, is not contradictory of the first hypothesis, it merely begins further back, with the suggestion that all the towns in the Antelope or Jeddito valley were Keresan, including Awatobi which was destroyed in 1700, traditionally by First Mesa people, possibly because the Bow people had been "washed" by a visiting friar.32 (In this connection note that in the Oraibi story ac- 30 Supplementary Data on Acoma. 31 Ibid. It occurs sporadically, only in some families, in Laguna (Laguna Genealogies, p. 181). 32 My guess is that Awatobi and, before it, Sikyatki, were destroyed not by Hopi but by nomad raiders, possibly the Utes.

Such collective human representatives are kept today by the Town chiefs. of San Felipe and Santo Domingo.)33 Several Hopi ceremonies are said to have been introduced from Awatobi:34 the women's Owaktil society,35 Singers society, the War society, and the women's Mamzrau society.36 (In this connection note that Owakill has wooden bird effigies and cone pedestals like the Flute society;37 that Owakiil and the War society use the Keresan sky sticks; that Singers, like W6w*chimtii, clown in the Keresan manner, and that Snake and Flute societies use painted stone tiles quite similar to those excavated at "a pueblo near Awatobi.")38 To be sure Awatobi has never been referred to by Hopi as a Keresan-speak- ing town, which probably means that at the time it was destroyed it was speaking Hopi, whatever language was spoken by its founders.

To admit destruction by the Utes would have hurt tribal pride. 33 H. R.
