<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Attalids of Pergamum. By E. V. HANSEN. Pp. xxxvi + 464; Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1947. $4.50. The bibliography and preface to this work show an extensive and painstaking research into one of the least treated, though far from the least interesting, sections of Hellenistic history: and the authoress has succeeded in concentrating in one convenient and readable handbook a large number of facts which have hitherto been difficult of access to most English students. The index is accurate and helpful; the notes are printed on the same page as the references, and though quite adequate they do not spoil the appearance of the page. The only faults to find with the production of the book are the absence of illustrations and the inadequacy of the one map provided; a single photo- graphic reproduction of a coin or a statue is worth several paragraphs of description, and a single map of the Caicus valley with the names of the towns in Greek and of the mountain ranges in Turkish is not an adequate substitute for a complete physical map of the whole Attalid empire. The text itself is divided between the political history of the Attalid dynasty; the organisation of their kingdom; their patronage of art, learning and architecture; and the religions of their subjects. In the first section Professor Hansen rightly refuses to popularise her subject by illegitimate imaginative recon- struction or by the forcing of modern analogies; we are given an interesting account of the rise of Philetaerus and the gradual accretion of royal and divine titles, but we are not given very much light on the individual character of the dynasts, except for the enigmatic and rather repulsive Attalus III. A description of contemporary events in Pontus and Bithynia might have helped to place the earlier Attalids in their correct historical perspective; but the whole history of the various Epigonic dynasties is so closely interwoven that any historian may be forgiven for sticking, if anything, too closely to his subject. The end of the dynasty is treated with more detail than the beginning: the revolt of Aristonicus is shown to have been, not as some historians regard it, an Oriental counterpart of the slave revolts in the West, nor even a purely nationalist rising, but a legitimate war of defence against the in- admissible Roman claims based on a misinterpretation of Attalus' will-a misinterpretation which is shown to have troubled Roman consciences in later years. The teachings of Iambulus are given what is probably their correct importance. No complaints of inadequacy can be made against the political and economic survey in Chapter VI. Here we are shown a Hellenistic kingdom from the inside, with its separate elements-Greek and barbarian, royal and repub- lican, insular and continental, religious and secular-welded together in a way that anticipates the Roman achievement. The possibility of Ptolemaic influence is not mentioned, and the authoress inclines to the view that the government was modelled largely on the system taken over from Persia: it is perhaps rather naive to suppose that the Royal Law mentioned on page 177 shows that Eumenes II had an abnormal interest in the tidiness of his capital, for there can have been few towns without some law of this kind. The study of art, architecture, learning and coinage are informative and interesting, though the lack of illustrations is a drawback. Perhaps there are too many technical terms-- words such as ' socle,' ' bucrania,' and ' protomes ' might be thought to call for a glossary. Nor does the Oxford English Dictionary justify the use of the word ' cannon ' on page 215. But the description of the Great Altar is vivid and brilliant. The most interesting chapter, however, is that which deals with Pergamene Cults. Asia Minor is generally thought to have preserved longer than any country the mysterious creeds and priesthoods of the pre-Hellenic Mediterranean; and here we find them brought into direct contact with the more anthropomorphic Olympian religion and with the worldly scepticism of Hellenistic city life. Most readers will probably be surprised to find that the Cabiri are simply a collective personification of a mercenary army: the Leleges, allies of the original Khabiri, were less fortunate and went down to history as a mere human tribe. The deification of the Attalids is treated fully, but again without much reference to the environment, though the note on the half-punning inscription EYEMNOY (sic) as a divine attribute is interesting. (Here, incidentally, we have one of the few misprints in the book: the reference to the same author of the same work as Rostowzew and Rostovtzeff within fourteen lines is not a serious matter, nor is the mis- spelling of two city names on the same page.) The cere- monies of initiation are soberly described, and we are given an impression of a city not unlike Shakespeare's Ephesus, in which everybody from the King downwards is an expert in medicine and magic. The names of Asclepius and Hygieia continually recur, and special interest in medical research is shown by Attalus III, whose very birth is mysterious- Professor Hansen, in her numerous attempts to account for the apparent fact that he was a firstborn son born after his parents had been married for eighteen years, overlooks the possible suggestion that he was of divine (i.e., priestly) origin. In fact, she pays little attention to the matriarchal survivals noticed by some historians; though plenty is said of Queen Stratonice, the bibliography does not mention any of the studies of Hellenistic Queens which have appeared during the present century, and no sociological deductions are made from the worship of the Magna Mater. It may seem ungenerous to complain that an author who has done so much for students with no knowledge of foreign languages should have left a few phrases untranslated; the passage from Goethe on page 397 is little loss, but surely there are English words for Vorburg and Hochburg? A translation of the Greek inscriptions is less necessary, for few students without Greek would be likely to be carrying out research of the kind which this book does so much to simplify. In fact, this book should be studied with the help of several other works of reference if it is to be of genuine assistance, and the narrative parts at least will well repay a second or third reading; and even with the small dis- advantages described, this compendium of widespread and recherche information will be extremely valuable to students of Hellenistic history and Roman expansion.
