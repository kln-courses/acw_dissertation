Native North American Smoking Pipes by William A. Türnbaügh Ancient exhibited museum native showcases in collectors' American are cabinets steeped smoking and in pipes a exhibited in collectors' cabinets and museum showcases are steeped in a rich and colorful history. Although they superficially resemble the modern pipes that line the shelves of a tobacconist's shop, these older implements dis- play a greater variety of shapes and materials. Native traditions and mythology reveal the im- portance with which early smoking instruments were regarded by the people of the New World. Links between the tobacco pipe, the gods and na- tive society were common beliefs in many cultures which viewed the pipe as a symbol of the group and its cosmic affiliation. The first American tobacco pipe legend re- corded by a European is typical. In 1603 when Samuel de Champlain began exploration up the St. Lawrence Valley, an Algonkian informant told him about the ancestral pipe presented by the Great Spirit. As long as the tribe preserved the pipe, the people enjoyed good fortune. Its sub- sequent loss brought famine. In the origin myths of the Cheyenne, Arapaho and other Indian groups, the tobacco pipe plays a role in the tribe's genesis, having been bestowed by a folk hero at the beginning of the world. The nineteenth- century artist George Catlin preserved a now familiar Sioux narrative about a famous Min- nesota pipestone quarry near the present-day town of Pipestone. In days long past, the Great Spirit summoned all the Indian nations together at the quarry. He broke off a stone from the ledge of red rock and with a turn of his hands shaped it into a large pipe which he filled and smoked to the four cardinal directions. As he did so, the Great Spirit admonished the assembled people to work in harmony on that hallowed ground and told them to fashion only pipes of peace from the sacred pipestone. Henry W. Longfellow later worked this legend into an episode of "Hiawatha." Today the quarry site is preserved as a national monument. Recent archaeological discoveries substantiate the hoary antiquity of these native pipes. The ear- liest forms are extremely rare. Because they were often made of un fired clay or perhaps organic materials such as bone, wood, leather or even bark, most of them have left little trace in the ar- chaeological record. Probably the oldest smoking device yet recovered in North Arnerica is a mod- ified natural form in the shape of a cylinder from the Jürgens site in Colorado. It was used as a smoking tube about 9,000 years ago. Two frag- mentary pipes from Fort Rock Basin in southcen- tral Oregon are estimated to date from 3,000 to 5,000 years ago.

But it was not until the northward spread of maize agriculture in the early centuries of the Christian era that smoking pipes came into more general use. Pipe forms reached an apex of artistic achievement and variety in the southern Great Lakes and Ohio Valley regions between 500 B.c. and a.D. 300 during the Adena and Hopewell phases. Effigy pipes are often found among the cult items in burial mounds erected at this time. The elaborate burial ceremonialism, artistic creativity, and long-distance trade networks maintained by Adena and Hopewell Indian groups probably were supported by simple farm- ing activities on rich river valley soils. TThe durability of smoking pipes through the centuries as a major element of native American culture lies in their symbolism and mystical associ- ations. Even apart from the importance of to- bacco, the pipes themselves are linked with life forces and other elemental beliefs in many New World societies. Every aspect of pipemaking and smoking - from the choice of raw materials, their shapes and ornamentation, to the rules governing use, and the substances tamped into their bowls - was a matter of considerable importance in many native societies. Traditional pipes, made from the most finely prepared clays, were carefully shaped and fired. The very process of forming a ceramic bowl from moist clay had the symbolic significance of bringing together the universal elements of earth and water, while the actual smoking of the pipe blended the forces of fire and air. In many regions both clay and stone pipes were sometimes used, particularly after European contact when the introduction of steel tools made stonecarving easier. The manufacture of stone pipes entailed a careful selection of material, stressing the stone's mystical as well as physical characteristics. Although fine-grained highly polished lithics that could be carved without diffi- culty were preferred, color was equally important. For example, red stone, widely associated with life or blood, was considered sacred. The importance of catlinite - the famous pipestone named after the artist who first documented the native tradi- tions associated with the Minnesota quarry - lies in its color as well as its workability. Many Indians believed that the stone's red hue came from the blood of bison consumed long ago by the Great Spirit. An even more prevalent tradition among the Plains tribes who used the quarry maintained that the stone represented the flesh of their own ancestors. So strictly did the local Sioux interpret the Great Spirit's injunction to use this sacred stone only for pipes that they tried to prevent Catlin from reaching the source of the pipestone in 1836 lest he remove some, thereby making a hole in the red man's flesh from which the blood would spill forever. At least seven local sources of red stone re- sembling catlinite were exploited ih the Plains area for pipemaking, but the most extensive quarry was the one that lay near Pipestone, Minnesota. In use for at least two centuries before Catlings un- welcome visit, the quarry is really a series of pits that extend for nearly a mile across the broken prairie. A ten to 20 inch layer of pipestone is sandwiched between thick strata of tough quartz- ite. The characteristic rich red stone is sometimes splashed with salmon colored speckles. In other areas various stones were used to make pipes ranging from steatite or soapstone to fine sandstone, hard clay or even pumice, a porous volcanic glass, and tuff, a very fine compacted volcanic ash. Favored materials and frequently the finished pipes themselves were transported through intertribal trade networks or obtained directly during long distance travels. A primary function of traditional pipes was to send smoke heavenward to attract the attention of the Great Spirit; some pif&gt;es were even called "cloud blowers." The combustible materials which filled the bowl were especially selected to please the gods. Most often tobacco, an indigenous American crop, was chosen. While it is question- able whether certain species of tobacco contain hallucinogenic elements, there is no debate that the plant itself held an esteemed place in New World ritual and mythology löng before the 16 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="3">Native American smoking pipes have been recovered archaeologically throughout the United States.

His scientific interest in the stone led to its being named after him . Here he illustrates the shallow workings from which the prized material was removed. Europeans encountered it at the beginning of the sixteenth century after Christ. For the Indians the "spirit power" of tobacco dictated a prescribed use that transcended mere indulgence or pleasure. Attempts to undermine the deep-rooted signifi- cance of tobacco were generally unsuccessful, whether made by Europeans or other Indians. The Iroquois mystic and reformer, Ganiodiyo or Handsome Lake (ca. 1735-1815) quickly discov- ered this principle when he urged his people to reduce tobacco's role in ritual life. His campaign against moral excesses was largely successful in re- vitalizing Iroquois culture in the early nineteenth century, but resistance to his tobacco policy forced him to abandon the issue. As the most favored and widely grown "super- natural" plant of the New World, tobacco was chewed, drunk as an infusion, smoked as a cigar or cigarette, and offered to wind, water or flame. But throughout most of North America, the use of tobacco is linked firmly with the pipe. The pipe played an especially vital role during formal occa- sions and important gatherings in native societies. Typically, special medicine pipes were reserved for these functions. Because of their reputed an- tiquity or traditional association with some hero, these pipes were considered to be exceedingly sa- cred and were subject to certain taboos and other restrictions. Among the Pawnee, for example, care was taken to tamp the medicine pipe with a spe- cial stick; if a hand carelessly touched the pipe, the gods might accept the smoker himself as a sacrifice rather than the tobacco! Probably the most familiar American Indian 18 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="5">This typical Plains style catlinite pipe dates from the nineteenth century.

Its large bowl was usually made of well- carved catlinite and was frequently inlaid with metal. The bowl was fitted to a long and some- times elaborately carved wooden stem which was often decorated with quillwork or feathers. Each of the two major components, the pipe bowl and the stem - more properly called calumet from the French word for reed - had great significance. The meshing of symbolic elements which pro- duced the peace pipe seems to have been accom- plished at a relatively late date. Frequent refer- ences to calumet pipes occur only after the latter half of the seventeenth century when historical documentation reveals the rapid diffusion of this instrument and its accompanying ceremonies among the tribes east of the Rockies. The use of ceremonial tobacco pipes to seal pacts and arbi- trate disputes became a widespread practice. Plains tribes, such as the Kiowa, made smoking the calumet pipe a legal act, binding participants to their word. European explorers who noticed that solemn agreements made in this manner were sel- dom broken, coined the term "peace pipe" to de- scribe the device. As late as 1977, more than a century after the Kiowa and Comanche had smoked a pipe together to initiate a successful in- tertribal peace, the Comanche and Utes symboli- cally closed their ancient animosity with an appro- priate ceremony that included puffing on a sacred pipe filled with tobacco.

They may have adopted the use of catlinite pipes at about this time. T he Indians' use of pipe and tobacco and the accompanying rituals captured the attention of European observers. An air of wonder and curiosity pervades early accounts of native Ameri- can pipe activity. The French explorer Jacques Cartier, describing the Indians of New France and their tobacco customs in 1580, noted that the na- tives drew on the pipe so deeply as to "fill their bodies full of smoke, till that cometh out of their mouths and nostrils, even as out of the Tunnel of a Chimney." Englishman Thomas Hariot, viewing the Indians similarly engaged in Virginia in 1586, marveled at their vigorous good health, a blessing which he attributed to their smoking activities, which "not only preserveth the body from obstructions, but also ... in short time breaketh them [obstructions] . . Ordinarily, newcomers eyed the ritual use of tobacco with skepticism or dismissed the ceremonies altogether as quaint or puerile amusements. Nevertheless the basic activ- ity of pipe smoking continued to interest them very much. Frequently the European onlookers themselves became participants and enthusiasti- cally reported their experiments. Hariot, for example, declared that "we ourselves, during the time we were there, used to sucke it after their manner, also since our return, and have found many rare and wonderful experiments of the virtues thereof: of which relation would re- quire a volume by itself." Between 1558 and 1565, men and women throughout western Europe were adopting the use of tobacco. Its ready acceptance on the Continent perhaps had been preconditioned somewhat by an earlier familiarity with Oriental hemp. In any case, tobacco's major recommendation was its alleged health-giving properties, the ultimate irony in view of modern deleterious findings. By 1570 natural scientists like Jean Liebault and Nicolas Monardes published treatises heralding tobacco as an effec- tive medicinal agent, a panacea against which vir- tually no disease or discomfort could long with- stand. Even a century later, John Josselyn's sum- 20 ARCHAEOLOGY</page><page sequence="7">Assorted North American pipes made of stone and clay representing Hopewell (top row), Iroquois (second row), Catawba (third row) and Toltec cultures (bottom right and left). mary of the "vertues of Tobacco" indicates that its réputation was undiminished: "It helps digestion, the Gout, the Tooth-ach, prevents infection by scents, it heats the cold, and cools them that sweat, feedeth the hungry, spent spirits restoreth, purgeth the stomach, killeth nits and lice; [and] the juice of the green leaf healeth green wounds although poysoned. . . Europeans most com- monly took their tobacco in simple clay pipes which they modeled after the traditional so-called elbow pipes made by the coastal Algonkians dur- ing the Early Colonial period. Considering that America's Indians had provided Europeans with their initial experiences of both pipe and tobacco only a short time earlier, it is ironic to find the Indians purchasing European-made clay pipes and colonial grown tobacco by the early 1600's. Yet as an impressive example of entrepreneurial intrepidity, these goods rapidly achieved a favored position among products commonly exchanged for good will, furs and land. Importation of pipes and tobacco had the im- mediate effect of extending the tobacco using and pipe smoking domain of native America into those few regions where climatic or cultural factors originally had forestalled their use. During the eighteenth century, even Arctic and Subarctic societies were adopting the tobacco complex from European fur traders and whalers. Trade activity eventually brought a shift in the role of pipes and tobacco within native culture itself. Through European exchange, these materials became more generally accessible to a greater number and vari- ety of individuals. Indians had raised and har- vested tobacco only in small quantities, and had grown and prepared it under rigorous proscrip- tions or secured it through long distance trade. Now tobacco was readily obtainable in volume. Moreover, the tobacco plant of commerce was a less harsh variety favored by the Europeans. This so-called Virginia tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) had been originally encountered in the Caribbean and was transplanted into the Tidewater plantations of America as a cash crop. By the late eighteenth century, it all but eclipsed the Indian tobacco ( Nicotiana rustica ) used in North America since prehistoric times. Most imported tobacco was smoked in Old World clay pipes, which were manufactured rapidly and cheaply. At times they were traded by the barrel to the natives along with tobacco, tobacco boxes, töngs, and other accouterments developed by the Europeans. The traditional significance of native grown tobacco and Indian-made pipes in Indian society initially declined as a result of this extensive traffic in European counterparts. Casual tobacco smok- ing even extended to native American women and children, a practice that not much earlier would have been utterly rejected. Such hedonistic smok- ing became commonplace, especially among In- dian groups who had maintained contact with the Europeans since earliest times. Clearly the tradi- tional employment of the tobacco pipe as a socially significant male-only activity was losing ground. Conservative elements within some native cultures eventually countered these changes by devising a more rigorous definition of the sacred contexts requiring the use of a formal pipe. Tobacco ritualism specifically emphasized links with the supernatural through the use of native pipes filled with native tobacco. In this way, unlike most other elements of indigenous material culture, the smoking pipe resisted total displacement by European products. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the number of traditional pipes multiplied. Pipes again became central to social activities and comprised one of the most im- portant grave furnishings for males. The final re- sult was an expanded role for the non-European smoking pipes, particularly the older examples from pre-Contact times. Concurrently, native to- bacco continued to be carefully cultivated, usually with strict adherence to a prescribed set of rituals Januaiy/Februaiy 1980 21</page><page sequence="8">that ranged from preparing the ground to proces- sing and using the harvested leaves. This latter-day fluorescence of traditional pipes corresponded to a general decline and overall fragmentation of other native lifeways. During this same period intertribal contact also increased- cir- cumstances largely precipitated by tribal disloca- tion and other direct and not so direct trends of European impact. The conscious attempt to pre- serve traditional elements of pipe and tobacco practices countered the challenge presented by the products of European commerce. Pipemaking be- came an increasingly specialized craft concentrated in the hands of a few traditionalists who employed the proper methods, materials and motifs. Late period pipe styles frequently made use of stylized decorations and naturalistic or anthropomorphic effigy forms which may have conveyed some mys- tical significance. Archaeologists have been able to determine the trade routes of these traditional items through lithic studies of the stone pipes as well as contemporary accounts. These sources in- dicate a rejuvenated long-distance trade in smok- ing paraphernalia between native groups. During the eighteenth century, formal pipe usage - particularly etiquette and rituals pertaining to the calumet - spread across the Continent along major waterways and communication routes. Most of these ceremonies can be traced back to the northern prairies. Perhaps because of its primacy in these regions, the handsome inverted T-shaped catlinite bowl became the most widely recognized form of calumet pipe. As the calumet's popularity swept across native America, missionaries began to denounce idolatory at work, while others, recog- nizing its great potential, seized the opportunity to profit. Jesuits attempted to stem the tide of native pipe ceremonialism with little success; meanwhile some of the Northwest and Upper Missouri fur traders carried raw catlinite between the growing numbers of tribes who desired red stone pipes. By the mid-nineteenth century, after the Minnesota Sioux were forced to temporarily relinquish the famous quarry, the stone came under still more direct non-Indian control. But even after rights to the source were restored by treaty in 1859, the Sioux consented to quarry and sell the stone to profiteers, who used lathes and other machinery to turn out quantities of catlinite pipes and trin- kets for the Indian trade. Between 1864 and 1866, the Northwest Fur Company alone had manufactured and sold nearly 2,000 pipes to Indians, and by 1892 it was estimated that less than one percent of catlinite goods were of native manufacture. As the white man commercialized these prod- ucts, the sacred red stone pipe probably came to mean less and less within the native context. Pos- sibly it was for this reason that Blackfoot infor- mants told Smithsonian ethnologist John C. Ewers in the 1940's that catlinite pipes obtained in trade from the Sioux had been smoked for pleasure among their people, but were not used in cere- monies. Although cigarettes had long since super- seded the stone pipe for pleasure smoking by the time of Ewers's visit, the Blackfoot elders still con- sidered their own local native-made stone pipes to be the standard ritual equipment. Nevertheless, after meeting with nearly a dozen pipemakers who survived on reservations in Montana and Al- berta, Ewers could trace a reluctant but inexorably growing detachment from traditional pipemaking methods through the successive generations. The older pipemarkers adhered more closely to con- servative methods and styles than their younger counterparts, preferring a fragment of sharpened hoop iron to modern steel drills, and the use of natural sandstone or abrasive rush stems to com- mercial sandpaper. Today a scant handful of pipemakers con- tinues to produce these instruments primarily for native American use. A few other craftmakers as- sociated with the Upper Midwest Indian Cultural Center also exercise their legal privilege to make use of the catlinite in the Pipestone National Monument. Employing simple carpentry tools, they create pipe bowls and small carvings for sale mainly to tourists and collectors. However com- mercial this work may be, it maintains a venerable craft and provides a tangible link to the past. But it is merely a vestige of the rich pipe tradition that flourished during the earlier history of America. For Further Reading on native pipemaking: John C.
