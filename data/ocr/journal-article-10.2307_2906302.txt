Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1976. 354 pages To begin a discussion of the work ofJacques Derrida is to immerse oneself in a problematic which seems altogether too mute on the one hand and altogether too expansive on the other. It is too expan- sive because the brilliance of thought and method seems to be gradually eroded by a sense of repetition-deconstruction is interesting, even very fruitful, yet its fruits are always the same. We always end up where we began. While the deconstructive process has had a profound effect on our views of texts, one ultimately has to wonder if it has not already worn itself out by its very success: do we really need to have all of the texts of Western civilization de- constructed to see that all of them are based on the same on- totheological conceptions? If not, one would have to say that the importance of Derrida's work must only begin with his critique of presence. And in this sense, he is too silent, for unless we want to make him merely a momentary mark in our writing, we must turn to the "origin" of his thought, which is finally not deconstruction itself but rather his notion of freeplay as the unnameable move- ment of alterity, of differance. The problem here is simply that freeplay is for him unnameable, however much one might choose to locate it momentarily by calling it "differance" or the "gramme" or the "trace." It resists formulation precisely because it is the non- origin of differance, of the play of writing. Nevertheless, if we are to understand properly Derrida's impor- tance, we must begin with freeplay, for it is apparently the alterna- MLN 94 (1979) 809-826 0026-7910/79/0944-0809 $01.00 0 1979 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">810 JAMES S. HANS tive to our previous ways of structuring the world, and if we are to learn more than just the deconstructive method, we must discern how our conception of discourse and the world changes if we begin with freeplay rather than with a hidden nostalgia for a center. If we assume that there is no center but only freeplay, if we assume there is no ultimate origin but only a never-ending play of differences in a system of discourse, what kinds of revision need to be made in our ways of looking at things, what new understanding do we have of discourse itself? We can only answer these questions after we have discovered some of the more implicit changes that occur in beginning with freeplay. For the moment, I am more interested in what Derrida says about freeplay through his description of it than I am concerned about the precise formulation itself. The best place to begin is with one of Derrida's presentations of freeplay, here as found in "Structure, Sign, and Play in the Dis- course of the Human Sciences": Freeplay is the disruption of presence. The presence of an element is always a signifying and substitutive reference inscribed in a system of differences and the movement of a chain. Freeplay is always an interplay of absence and presence, but if it is to be radically conceived, freeplay must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and absence; being must be conceived of as presence or absence beginning with the possibility of freeplay and not the other way around.' This definition provides three variations which partially encompass the word: first, freeplay is defined as "the disruption of presence"; second, it is defined as the interplay between presence and absence; and finally, it is described as something which "must be conceived of before the alternative of presence and absence." We have these three shifts, of course, because freeplay for Derrida is at once all of these descriptions and yet none of them. Because freeplay is un- nameable, Derrida is forced to surround the notion through ex- clusion, as he does here and frequently elsewhere. Only by doing this can he separate freeplay from ontotheological notions of an origin, of pure presence, that which freeplay is not. And as such, his strategy seems to work, though it forces us to focus on the unsaid in the description. Given this understanding of his strategy, however, we must realize that it is indeed the unsaid that we must look at, and when we look at the unsaid here, we see that Derrida really seems to be defining freeplay in terms of absence, that he has replaced the concept of the center as pure presence with freeplay as absence.</page><page sequence="3">M L N 811 This makes sense insofar as he wants to deconstruct our false nos- talgia for presence, but even if he concedes the need to deal with the end of ontotheology within the ontotheological field of dis- course, we must question what effects result from this valorizing of absence. That absence is valorized is revealed, I think, in the first sentence above, where freeplay is defined as the "disruption of presence." This is the only sentence in the definition Derrida pro- vides which does not include presence and absence in the same formulation, though here absence is present nonetheless, for isn't absence traditionally conceived of as the disruption of presence? In this decision to leave absence only implicit in the statement, in this absence of absence, Derrida reveals his general mode of operation: he denies that freeplay is either absence or presence, suggesting that it is anterior to such notions, but at the same time he suggests implicitly that freeplay is really absence, that it is somehow absence and yet not absence. I do not mean to imply that Derrida is trying to deceive us here; I only want to point out that in the end he writes of a freeplay that is linked to absence and that this has a profound effect on his description. That Derrida's work is oriented towards absence is hardly as- tonishing, however; indeed, one need look no further than to his inversion of speech and writing to see that he makes a practice of using absence-oriented concepts as placeholders for that which is presumably neither absence nor presence. In the end, the emphasis on writing, the valorizing of the self-reflexiveness of script and the self-consciousness which is part of this activity only serve to reinscribe the world in terms of absence. This is no coincidence, since Derrida must do what he can to differentiate his discourse from the ontotheological mode which he is deconstructing, and since the natural way to do that is to valorize the terms which oppose the ones one is attacking. It is inescapable that once the discourse comes to a rest, it must come to a rest somewhere, and that somewhere in Derrida's case is a writivg which is conceived of as the absence as the non-origin of freeplay. In conceding that Derrida must fall back on absence, we need not deny that he is trying to avoid that fall; we need only point out that he cannot avoid it and that therefore all of his writing is marked by absence at least as much, if not more, than by the trace of freeplay. While our primary concern is ultimately with the notion of freeplay, then, we need to determine how Derrida's freeplay is infected by the absences that are writing. Only by discerning just how completely the play is infected by absence can we come to any</page><page sequence="4">812 JAMES S. HANS understanding of where to place freeplay. A good starting point for such an inquiry is another remark which states the problem of play in another context: The (pure) trace is difference. It does not depend on any sensible plenitude, audible or visible, phonic or graphic. It is, on the contrary, the condition of such a plenitude. Although it does not exist, although it is never a being-present outside of all plenitude, its possibility is by rights anterior to all that one calls sign .. . concept or operation, motor or sensory. This differance is therefore not more sensible than intelligible and it permits the articulation of signs among themselves within the same abstract order....2 True to his tendency for the large sweep, Derrida here seems to have excluded everything from the possibility of differance. It "does not exist," is "never a being-present," leading us back once again to suggestions of absence; it is "anterior" to sign, concept, motor and sensory operation; yet it is "not more sensible than intel- ligible." The problem here is that the list of exclusions ends with a negative which is not really negative, which suggests that differance is no less intelligible than sensible, that it is both intelligible and sensible at the same time. But if this were true, how could differ- ance be anterior to motor or sensory operations, how could it be anterior to sign and concept? The exclusions here suggest at first that differance is neither sensible nor intelligible and then that it is both sensible and intelligible. This is the usual manner of formulat- ing such an unnameable non-concept, yet after the paradoxical formulation, one must go ahead and talk about the non-concept in one set of terms or the other, since discourse would be impossible if one had to continuously formulate the notion of differance both as neither sensible nor intelligible and as both sensible and intelligible at the same time. So, to avoid this problem of discourse, one defines the non-term in terms of a paradox and then continues to discuss it largely one way or the other, and Derrida chooses to speak of a non-term which is neither sensible nor intelligible. It is important to realize that Derrida has this choice, and it is also important to realize that he must choose the absence-oriented con- struct, the one which suggests differance is neither sensible nor intelligible. He must choose this path because his non-term "dif- ferance" speaks of discontinuity, and the term itself would have little applicability for a view which suggests "both/and" rather than "neither/nor." "Differance" does not make sense in terms of "both/and." His choice of terminology leads to a choice of descrip-</page><page sequence="5">M L N 813 tion which is absence-oriented, but it seems equally plausible to phrase the problem positively, to say that the pure trace of differ- ance is both sign and concept, both motor and sensory operation, both sensible and intelligible. In deconstructing pure presence, Derrida has only shifted the logical contradiction to the other term in the series. The contradiction of the ontotheological view is that one must conceive of a pure presence at the same time that one must conceive of that pure presence as an interplay of presence and absence, yet the presence of absence itself negates any notion of pure presence. Derrida, on the other hand, wants to argue for an absence that cannot make any sense without a corresponding interplay between absence and presence, yet presence itself cor- rupts his notion of absence. Once again, all this is true because for Derrida, "differance" is ultimately described in terms of absence, and this leaves us with an absence which generates an interplay between absence and presence but which cannot account for the presence of presence. Derrida is writing the mirror image of on- totheology, and that mirror image generates in a negative manner the same contradiction which Derrida attacks in his deconstruction of presence. Put another way, one could say that Derrida negates the notion of "sensible plenitude" by making it only a concept; as concept, it depends upon linguistic differance, for a sensible plenitude could only be understood in terms of a non-sensible plenitude so long as one concedes that in the network of discourse each term is defined in terms of what it is not. In another sense, though, such a proposi- tion does no more than deny the existence of a difference between an awareness of a sensible plenitude and the plenitude itself. It denies consciousness any status besides self-consciousness; the de- nial of presence is a denial of any kind of non-thematized con- sciousness which might not necessarily be immediately reflexive. On the other hand, though Derrida insists that there is no such thing as a non-thematized consciousness or a non-thematized awareness of the world, he proposes a view in which our self- consciousness has been dispersed into a network of writing which has, at the same time, through its dispersion, become unseif- conscious. He denies that our consciousness can be dispersed into the world while arguing that it must be dispersed into the network of discourse. Here I am only restating in another key what Derrida says in a discussion of "Structure, Sign, and Play": Now I don't know what perception is and I don't believe that anything</page><page sequence="6">814 JAMES S. HANS like perception exists. Perception is precisely a concept, a concept of an intuition or of a given originating from the thing itself, present itself in its meaning, independently from language, from the system of refer- ence. And I believe that perception is interdependent with the concept of origin and of center and consequently whatever strikes at the metaphysics of which I have spoken strikes also at the very concept of perception. (272) Since "perception," "sensible plenitude," "consciousness" and the like are all mere concepts, they do not in fact exist. There is no perception because there is nothing to perceive, no consciousness because there is no such thing as a consciousness which is purely self-present. The central statement in the above argument, though, is that Derrida denies the possibility of perception because it relies on a belief in things which exist "independently from language, from the system of reference." For Derrida, nothing can exist indepen- dently from language, which means that all things are merely con- cepts, including "perception," "experience," and "consciousness." But can't one concede that language has a hand in shaping percep- tions, in ordering experience and consciousness, without negating everything that is not language? If we grant that there is no such thing as pure presence, must we concede that there is nothing but a network of discontinuous signs? Grammatology, of course, rests precisely on this point: there is no perception or consciousness, and without perception and con- sciousness, only language remains. Thus, we return again to the same movement we saw before: Derrida wants to deconstruct presence, so he falls back upon the concept of absence; Derrida wants to deconstruct perception and consciousness, two concepts connected to presence, so he falls back upon language, written language. The question is, what is to be gained by this move? We are left with a freeplay that we can say little about on the one hand and a series of deconstructions of the old presence-oriented system on the other. One can only move in the direction of a never-ending series of deconstructions which always reveal the same on- totheological core. Such a radical move is perhaps necessary to initiate a revaluation of Western metaphysics, but once that move has become a part of the discourse, another revaluation seems necessary. As Derrida admits, he is relying on that metaphysic to make his own statements, and indeed, he is in a sense the highest expression of that metaphysic to the extent that he relies so heavily</page><page sequence="7">M L N 815 on the dissection of language which has been the predominant motif this century. It seems to me, then, that it is time to reevaluate what Derrida has said, and although Derrida himself might call my approach a re- gression, I would suggest the following direction. Freeplay is in- deed the central and essential aspect of Derrida's work, though it often gets lost in discussions of differance and in the deconstruc- tions of texts. Freeplay in its relation to the elimination of a center, to the critique of presence as self-presence, to the falling back upon a non-origin which generates the alterity of discourse, focusses upon the most important things Derrida has brought to light: the need to think a non-centered world and the need to think the discontinuities of this non-centered world. The question remains, however, whether or not we can think of a world without an Origin which still has origins, whether we can think of a world without Pure Presence which still has presence. If we cannot, I want to argue, we will never be able to think freeplay-we will only be able to play freely without understanding how freeplay plays freely, without understanding that freeplay plays freely while still being bound by its own play. Nor will we be able to see that while lan- guage is a part of the freeplay of the world, the freeplay of the world is more than the freeplay of language. We must begin our evaluation by turning to what is probably the most central statement Derrida makes about freeplay: As a turning toward the presence, lost or impossible, of the absent origin, this structuralist thematic [that we find in Levi-Strauss] of broken immediateness is thus the sad, negative, guilty, Rousseauist facet of thinking of freeplay of which the Nietzschean affirmation-the joyous affirmation of the freeplay of the world and without truth, without origin, offered to an active interpretation-would be the other side. This affirmation then determines the noncenter otherwise than as loss of the center. (264-65) We seem here to have only two choices: we can think the Rous- seauist freeplay which in the end is merely a nostalgia for Eden, a freeplay which simply hopes for a recovery of innocence, or we can think the Nietzschean freeplay of affirmation without truth, the freeplay which Derrida considers to be the endless play of the signs of writing. But this distinction is too facile, it leaves too much out. To be sure, Derrida is correct when he says of Rousseau that "To the extent that he belonged to the metaphysics of presence, he dreamed of the simple exteriority of death to life, evil to good, rep-</page><page sequence="8">816 JAMES S. HANS resentation to presence, signifier to signified... ."3 Rousseau is caught up in that network; he is attempting to save a conception of the origin by excluding death, evil and representation from it, and as such his guilt and complicity in the metaphysic of presence are clear. But does Rousseau's choice, or rather the negation of it, mean that the only other possibility is Derrida's? If Derrida is going to exclude all possibilities besides "Rous- seau's" and "Nietzsche's" we need to know why there are only these two choices. The answer, I think, is that Derrida cannot escape the system of differences that he himself has set into play. We are told in another essay, for example, that "What we do know, what we could know if it were simply a question of knowing is that there never has been and never will be a unique word, a master name."4 This, of course, is but another restatement of the crux of all of Derrida's work, and I don't in the least wish to deny the validity of it. There is no master name, there is no unique word, there is no lost origin or center. But it does not follow from this that every- thing is writing, that there is nothing outside of the differance of the linguistic system. It means that our view of things cannot avoid being shaped by the system we use to describe the world, but it does not turn everything into discourse. Instead, it simply says that there is no Eden behind us and no Paradise in front of us, that Eden and Paradise were just fictions of ours which have no applicability to the world; it says that there is no one Origin for language or man or beings, which was only another fiction of ours; and it may also say that "consciousness," "perception," "man" and the like are all just other substitutions in the chain for that mythic Origin. But while each of these terms may be only interchangeable substitutions in the written chain, this does not necessarily imply that all of them are duplicates of the original concept of the lost essence. It is possi- ble that as some of these concepts have come to be decentered, they may have broken away from their original complicity in the nostal- gic chain. "Consciousness" was at one time thought to be the center of the game, and "man" and the others had the same function at one time or another, but now that they are no longer the locus of the lost origin, they remain essential to our understanding of cer- tain aspects of our world. There is no more "pure" consciousness, but man is conscious for all that, and his consciousness, however impure, is still more than a concept, still more than a sign in a chain, though it is that as well. Derrida would doubtless respond that, on the contrary, "con-</page><page sequence="9">M L N 817 sciousness," "man" and the like remain only concepts and nothing more, but if that is the case, so does language or "writing," and if that is so, then we truly are left mute. We cannot even speak of freeplay without erasing it immediately. If we accept the structur- ing power of differance, need we conclude that no concepts are valid, that all of them are deconstructed by other signs in the sys- tem? I would argue that, on the contrary, we can accept the total absence of a master name without at the same time capitulating totally to differance, that we can accept the notion of a non- centered world without necessarily denying consciousness, percep- tion, or even language. But we can only do this by bringing to an end the age of the sign, by decentering language itself, by refusing to turn away from freeplay and by looking straight at it so that we can see more clearly how it functions. We can have origins without having an Origin, we can have consciousness without making it the lost center, and we can have man without having Man. Just as Nietzsche and Freud decentered consciousness, so too we must decenter language and call an end to its reign if we are to see how freeplay plays the world. But first we must speak about absence. If the deconstructionist mode works, and it does, it does so only because it relies on a concept that, by its alterity, is as central to Western metaphysics as is "essence," "origin," or "Being." That concept is the notion of desire, specifically desire as lack, as an absence that needs to be filled up. In a sense, each of Derrida's texts is simply a repetition of this one theme: man defines his desire as lack and seeks to fill up his desire by locating the lost origin; he seeks the supplement that will supplant his lack. Most tellingly, Derrida defines this ontotheology as the dream "of full presence, the reassuring foundation, the origin, and the end of the game" (265). Desire, defined as lack, seeks a plenitude that will fill the void, that will end the play of the game which generates the anxiety of living. Man dreams this desire as fullness, as origin, but it is really the end, death, the absence which ends the game as a non- origin and a non-presence. Derrida is correct in pointing out that this has been the fundamental play of our metaphysic, which is ultimately defined as a desire to find the lost center, the desire to fill up the hole of self-consciousness which was created by the eruption of language. And he is also correct in arguing that it is the eruption of language that forever puts an end to any false notions of the origin-the origin becomes a concept only when a lack ap- pears, and that lack is brought about by the violence of writing</page><page sequence="10">818 JAMES S. HANS which excludes the possibility of an origin. The need for a supple- ment and the permanent inadequacy of any supplement are born in the same moment, and it is the unravelling of this connection and the consequences of it to which Derrida devotes himself. Since Derrida is implicated in the same game, though, however much he is aware of its consequences, we can only conclude that his solution to the dilemma has been to overturn the system. He has taken the absence or lack, the death that is the hidden word behind desire and self-consciousness, he has given it the supplementary word "writing," and then he has rewritten the system in terms of absence, in terms of death, only disguised as writing. One could argue that "death," like "consciousness" and "'presence," is only a concept, and that since it is only a concept, one can employ the supplement "writing" as easily as "death," but the key concept re- mains "death," the hidden counterpart to our nostalgia for origins. And if the key concept is "death," or even only its supplementary expressions of "desire as lack" or "writing," one can only conclude that Derrida's work is just as guilty as Rousseau's, that his work is as much a disguise of the problem as was Rousseau's. We have already seen how Derrida deconstructs Rousseau as a system which dreams the exteriority of death, evil, and representation; Derrida has really only dreamed a system which exteriorizes life, the good, and presence. There are certainly benefits to this approach, but why is this perspective any more valid than the metaphysic which it over- turns? Why is it necessarily preferable to valorize the represented over the present, evil over good, death over life? Admittedly, Derrida would say that he is not rewriting the metaphysic in terms of death or desire as lack, that he is rather emphasizing the non-original play which generates the life/death, good/evil, presence/absence differences, but as I have already ar- gued, he cannot really do that given his perspective and his re- lationship to writing. Once he chooses "writing" as the supplement for his game, he has implicated himself in the opposite game, nothing more. He may try to keep the opposite game out of play by the continual play of his writing, but his writing must fall back on something, and that something is "death" as "writing." He has not escaped the metaphysic but merely turned it on its head. He has not decentered things-he has only recentered them in the negative image of absence or desire as lack, or death, or writing. The origins of his own metaphysic cannot be erased, however much Derrida tries to decenter them continually as he writes, and thus he is</page><page sequence="11">M L N 819 caught up in his own trap, caught by the lure which is just as much a part of Western metaphysics as presence is. To establish this reversal of the system from yet one more perspective, one need only turn to Derrida's critique of Levi- Strauss. Prior to his discussion of the bricoleur/engineer problem in Le'vi-Strauss, Derrida describes what happened when the concept of presence became problematic: From then on it was probably necessary to begin to think that there was no center, that the center could not be thought in the form of a being- present, that the center had no natural locus, that it was not a fixed locus but a function, a sort of non-locus in which, in the absence of a center or origin, everything became discourse ... that is to say, when everything became a system where the central signified, the original or transcen- dental signified, is never absolutely present outside a system of differ- ences. The absence of the transcendental signified extends the domain and the interplay of signification ad infinitum. (249) This argument again places us inalterably in the domain of only two choices, suggesting that these two choices necessarily exclude all of the others. Here, Derrida is describing the moment when, for him, everything became culture. He argues that the moment when discourse became the center of Western metaphysics, nature was no longer possible; it was swallowed up by the process of significa- tion which totally excluded nature. If we concede that there is no nature, according to Derrida, if we concede that there is no tran- scendental signified like Nature that our linguistic system could ever hope to totalize by locating the master name or by making that master name Nature, we concede that there is no nature, that there is only discourse, that we have only the play of signs in a system which has absolutely no reference outside of the system that it is. This recognition calls into question, or rather obliterates, the dis- tinction between nature and culture. The distinction between nature and culture, of course, is central to Levi-Strauss's work, and Derrida's critique of him is based on the fact that Levi-Strauss spent a lifetime utilizing the distinction be- tween nature and culture while recognizing "the impossibility of making it acceptable" (253). Derrida himself, however, is caught in the same trap. The remarks I quoted in the previous paragraph show that he collapses nature into culture, that he has made "na- ture" only one more "non-full" sign in the network of oppositions, yet its very difference remains essential to a system which estab- lishes cultural discourse as the "center" of the non-center. "If,"</page><page sequence="12">820 JAMES S. HANS Derrida says, "one calls bricolage the necessity of borrowing one's concepts from the text of a heritage which is more or less coherent or ruined, it must be said that every discourse is bricoleur" (255). And if that is true, one can no longer meaningfully speak of an engineer who has escaped bricolage, and then "the very idea of bricolage is menaced and the difference in which it took on its meaning decomposes" (256). Derrida runs the same risk: by trans- forming everything into discourse, into culture, he has denied anything more than a theological value to "nature," and the system decomposes. He may try to avoid that risk by paradoxical state- ment, by the play of his writing, by the references to the unname- able freeplay and the like, but once he has established writing in the position of eminence, once the interplay of signifiers has become all there is, he has made a choice which leads to the same conse- quences as Levi-Strauss's. He becomes locked within his own myth, and once it is recognized as myth, it has no more value than any of the myths which have preceded it and no more necessity than any of them. Derrida himself, then, is really the end of the metaphysic he de- constructs so well, and a recognition of this should make us redirect our attention to what is left unsaid in his writing. If, as I suggested, he employs the notion of desire as absence or lack to deconstruct the metaphysic of presence, perhaps we ought to reexamine this notion of desire. Desire as lack is really only another way of de- scribing consciousness as reflexivity, as continual self-referentiality, and it is this reflexivity that is at the heart of the deconstructionist thematic. It denies the notion of experience and substitutes the pure reflexivity not of consciousness but of the network of dis- course; it denies a center to freeplay and surrenders itself to a seemingly indeterminate game. Given this, we must raise the fol- lowing intersecting questions: 1) Can there be a non-centered no- tion of experience which can escape being collapsed into the re- flexivity of discourse? 2) Can there be a notion of desire which is not determined solely by absence or lack? 3) Can there be a non- centered freeplay which still has rules that are determined by its play? We can begin our consideration of these questions by a glance at one of Derrida's statements about the function of the center in Western metaphysics. We are told that The concept of centered structure is in fact the concept of a freeplay based on a fundamental ground, a freeplay which is constituted upon a</page><page sequence="13">M L N 821 fundamental immobility and a reassuring certitude, which is itself be- yond the reach of freeplay. With this certitude anxiety can be mastered, for anxiety is invariably the result of a certain mode of being implicated in the game, of being caught by the game, of being as it were from the very beginning at stake in the game. (248) The notion of a centered structure is posited for freeplay so that we can master our anxiety by repressing the fact that we ourselves are at stake in the play, that we ourselves are on the line in the playing out. There must be something outside of the play itself, something to ground it and eliminate this anxiety. All that Derrida says here once again seems accurate and consistent with his other formu- lations of our nostalgias, and indeed, it even seems an absurdity to speak of "freeplay" and "centered structure" in the same sentence, for the one really ends up negating the other. If there is a centered structure, freeplay is hardly freeplay anymore, for the structure itself denies this freedom; and if we accept the notion of freeplay, we must have done with a center, for it is precisely the static con- cept which covers up the freeplay of freeplay. If we eliminate the center, though, where are we to turn? Once again, Derrida seems to think that there is only one alternative to a centered world, the alternative based on discourse and interpreta- tion: There are thus two interpretations of interpretation. The one seeks to decipher, dreams of deciphering, a truth or an origin which is free from freeplay and from the order of the sign, and lives like an exile the necessity of interpretation. The other, which is no longer turned toward the origin, affirms freeplay and tries to pass beyond man and humanism, the name man being the name of that being who, through- out the history of metaphysics or of ontotheology-in other words, through the history of all of his history-has dreamed of full presence, the reassuring foundation, the origin and the end of the game. (265) If we do not choose to act as though we are "deciphering" the "truth" or the "origin," we must give ourselves over to a freeplay which identifies freeplay, interpretation, structure and sign, we must give ourselves over to "absolute chance" which "surrenders itself to genetic indetermination, to the seminal adventure of the trace" (265). Our alternatives are simple: to be nostalgic and act as though there is an origin which can be recovered, or to reject any notion of an origin and affirm absolute chance. But aren't these choices limited precisely because of their linguistic origin? Aren't we forced into this dichotomy by the structurings of the network?</page><page sequence="14">822 JAMES S. HANS Isn't freeplay itself limited by the discourse that it is? If one is to use the word "freeplay" precisely, wouldn't one have to create a situa- tion of pure, totally random chance? In other words, isn't Derrida's notion of freeplay as nostalgic in its own right as is pure presence, doesn't it require an impossible purity as well? Freeplay may well be genetically indeterminate in terms of the origin, but the play of freeplay is nonetheless determined by the structurings of the dis- course within which it plays. And this is more true the more radi- cally one cuts off the network of signs from anything external to it. We have only opted for the order of the language in place of an order of external origins. Furthermore, if freeplay is connected to differance, which is neither word nor concept, how can freeplay be identified here with sign and structure? Derrida collapses freeplay into discourse here, whereas previously it was that non-concept which generated dis- course while being involved in discourse at the same time. Indeed, the very fact that it is unnameable suggests that it is implicated in the game, like man, at the same time that it structures the game. But given this, how can Derrida claim that freeplay is the realm of absolute chance? He is faced with the same kind of problem that always faces a system based on reflexivity: he has not escaped the need to have something outside the network generate activity within the network. Man, consciousness, experience and the like no longer transcend the linguistic system of which they are concepts, but "freeplay" serves that role instead. It is said to be unnameable, inexplicable, yet it is essential for it to be both inside and outside of the network if the network is to hold together. The pure reflexivity of the system seems based on a totally nonreflexive notion, free- play, which is a substitute for "man," "experience," and so on. The problem is not that the reflexive network of signs remains based on something nonreflexive so much as that the nature of this non- reflexiveness remains obscure. Derrida's move is correct here, that is, his move away from a nonreflexive human center: to the extent that man participates in the freeplay of the world, he remains something less than the freeplay of which he is a part. In this sense Derrida is right to substitute "freeplay" for "man" and to call for an end to the "Man" of humanism. In doing this, though, he has left freeplay totally free when it must be bound at least by its own play; one can understand his reasons for refusing to name freeplay any more specifically, but one still needs to know more about it. If we put the problem into a different context, we can see the</page><page sequence="15">M L N 823 problem more clearly. At issue is the question of whether or not one can conceive of "perception," "consciousness" and the like as saturated by the differance of discourse at the same time that one conceives of their being something more than signs in the network, something more which can be confirmed by discourse. If freeplay is the one indeterminate, nonreflexive moment that we have, can't we argue that experience, perception and the like are partial subsets of that freeplay, demarcations of certain areas of freeplay which are nonreflexive as well as parts of the reflexivity of discourse? Free- play is still the only "thing," non-concept and non-origin which is "more than" language, but experience and perception are equally conceptual and nonconceptual, equally implicated in the freeplay of the system of signs at the same time that they confirm something other than signs, that is, the freeplay which establishes the relation among the signs in the network. If this freeplay is indeed nonreflex- ive in its nonconceptual nature, we still have something outside of discourse which is played with and confirmed through discourse. And experience and perception are both outside of discourse and inside it at the same time. There is still no center, origin or master name, for freeplay is the generalized non-concept of which man, experience and the like are only subsets, and there is no way for the subsets to ever speak the freeplay fully. Nevertheless, there is something to be confirmed by the freeplay of discourse, and that is the play which always partially but never totally exceeds the net- work. Unless we made freeplay totally reflexive, which Derrida doesn't, this is the only conclusion which can be drawn. But then discourse too must be decentered because it is something less than freeplay while also being bound up with it. We can see another view of the dilemma if we look at the relation between freeplay and "rules" more carefully. If freeplay is literally pure chance, then anything is possible; if freeplay has rules of its own, anything may be possible, but some things are more possible than others. And this, I suppose, is but another way of saying that it seems to be as fatuous to argue for a totally indeterminate freeplay as it is to argue for a totally centered freeplay. Freeplay is precisely the continual working out of the relationship between various "non-centers" and complete randomness. However nostalgic it may be, it seems irrefragable that freeplay limits itself through its own play, that the very process of freeplay confirms some things and denies others. Something is always at stake in freeplay, and it is the nature of its at-stakeness which is worked out through the play. It</page><page sequence="16">824 JAMES S. HANS is, after all, freeplay which denies the autonomy of consciousness, perception and man, so there must have been a process of playing, guided by the rules of its play, which led to this view. In this sense I am simply saying once again that Derrida has quite severely limited the play of freeplay by equating it with discourse; instead of saying that discourse is involved in freeplay, which it is, he says discourse is freeplay, which is not true, or which is "true" only insofar as one chooses to accept a system that begins and ends with reflexiveness, with writing, while at the same time arguing that freeplay is the nonreflexive element in the play of writing which generates its reflexivity. To the extent that freeplay is a non-concept and a non-word, it exceeds the discourse which it sets into play; to the extent that that is true, freeplay is not totally indeterminate but is ordered by the play between the non-concept and discourse, which means that a non-centered freeplay is still guided by the rules of its own play. It cannot be purely indeterminate any more than it can be purely reflexive, and once one admits this, one has to recognize the non- reflexivity which exceeds the system of reflection. Freeplay then is nothing more than the non-word for everything which escapes reflexivity, for the non-concepts which escape conceptualization and are still partially conceptualized. What I am arguing against is not only Derrida but the entire structuralist movement (though Derrida, of course, is not himself purely a structuralist). What I am arguing against is a thematic which, like Derrida's, calls on us to "pass beyond man and humanism" at the same time that it suggests we do this by collapsing man into the interstices of discourse when discourse itself is the highest achievement of that man and humanism of which it heralds the end. It is true that it is time to pass beyond man and humanism, and it is true that the struc- turalists pointed the way, but one can only pass beyond them by decentering man's discourse as well, notjust the concept of man. It was as much man who made discourse as it was discourse which made man, and so we must come to realize that discourse itself is nothing more than the human link to freeplay, that freeplay itself is much more than the discourse which is also part of its play. Given this, we must speak of a freeplay which is free within the limits of its play but which is also bound by the productions of its play, which both are and are not simply discourse. Discourse is one of the limits of freeplay, but not the only one, and if this is so we must not only pass beyond -the anthropomorphism of humanism but also the lin-</page><page sequence="17">M L N 825 guistic anthropomorphism of structuralism and post-structuralism. We need to consider the relationship between freeplay and its pro- ductions, one of which is discourse, and we need to consider the effects of productions on the freeplay which generates them. To recapitulate, we can say that to the extent that "man," "per- ception," "consciousness" and the like are merely concepts, so too is "discourse" only a concept. In this system, the only "thing" which is not a concept is "freeplay," yet it too is a concept to the extent that Derrida occasionally identifies it with the sign. In this context, freeplay may be merely a concept, since the problem of the relation between freeplay and discourse is parallel to the problem of the engineer and the bricoleur in Levi-Strauss, and Derrida needs this freeplay to keep discourse afloat. Or else freeplay may be only the pure generator of discourse, but this, while the reverse of the pre- vious situation, leads to the same problem in that it requires some- thing outside of discourse without itself being discourse. Both views are nostalgic in that they require something that is not discourse, but what both propositions are really suggesting is that we must conceive of freeplay as something which is implicated in discourse irretrievably at the same time that it still exceeds discourse. Free- play, though non-centered, is bound on the one hand by the systems of discourse in which it is implicated and by that which exceeds discourse on the other, though it is precisely that excess which needs to be determined. Finally, we need to go back to the Nietzschean affirmation of the play of signs for its own sake in order to see that for Derrida, desire is really more than lack or absence. It is in one sense a lack which needs to be filled up, but it is also simply the joyous affirmation of the productions of freeplay. In that sense, desire can never be purely affirmative any more than the freeplay itself can be either pure or totally indeterminate; it must always also concern itself with a lack which leads to new productions, which is part of the freeplay of the system. The point here is simply that Derrida has suggested this notion of desire without adequately describing its relation to desire as lack just as he has not always kept the relationship be- tween freeplay and discourse in view. The real suggestiveness of Derrida's writing is that he brings together these notions in a new way without following through altogether on them. Desire as af- firmation of productions is as closely linked to freeplay as is free- play to discourse and desire as lack, and what we need to do now is to probe this relationship to see how these new possibilities change the</page><page sequence="18">826 JAMES S. HANS topography of our discourse and understanding. This probing should lead us to a clearer understanding of the relationship be- tween indeterminacy and determinacy in freeplay and language as well as to insight into the relation between reflexivity and nonre- flexivity in freeplay, production and discourse. These, however, are all traces of a different essay rather than marks of the present one. Here it is sufficient to say that although ultimately Derrida's writing is colored by a false reliance on the categories of absence, this was perhaps a necessary step in closing that epoch of metaphysics which has ordered Western civilization for so long. The primary problem for Derrida in that reliance on absence is that it prevents him from recognizing the essential relation between writing and the humanism he wants to put an end to, it keeps him from stressing that freeplay is larger than discourse in the sense that more than human discourse participates in freeplay-discourse itself is only one of the productive processes that freeplay is, not the only one. Given these qualifications on Derrida's enterprise, one can only add that his writing has brought into play the relations that will doubtless dominate future writings for some time to come.
