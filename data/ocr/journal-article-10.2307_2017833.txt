<plain_text><page sequence="1">BEAUTY AND NATURE SINCE art is in an obvious sense artifact, made by human beings to satisfy human need, and since nature is not manifestly the pro- duct of a mind, apparently nature- and art-appreciation require al- ternative esthetic interpretations. At least, some 2500 years of occidental thought have not yet established the tenet that nature is such a product. Even a cursory acquaintance with art-production makes for a high degree of confidence that a work of art bears the mark of a more or less conscious intent of a highly sensitive mind. Except in certain cases of fraud, the artist's esthetic imprint persists in his work, th-e traces of which constitute the data by which we as appreciators re- create the total esthetic situation. From these recalcitrant factors we must reconstitute the intended expression. The clues to this re- creation are there in the artist's signature, not at the bottom of the painting or on the title-page of the composition, but in the brush stroke or in the idiom of the musical phrase. To assert that nature is similarly constituted by conscious pur- pose is to leave oneself open to the charge of dogmatism, for it does not patently possess marks of esthetically motivated purpose. But supposing that nature lends itself to esthetic apprehension, we have the problem of whether it possesses value in itself without any im- putation from us; or whether as esthetically indifferent, nature may be charged with esthetic significance only by us. Assuming that esthetic value is constituted only by a relationship of a mind to its object in a complete experience, we may now plunge into the turbu- lent waters of theory. That nature is purposive in itself may be either the silent con- viction of the nature-lover, or it may be an articulate credo asserting boldly that nature is objectively beautiful. This latter may be as- serted in diverse forms. It may be variously theological, ranging</page><page sequence="2">BEAUTY AND NATURE 653 anywhere from pantheism to theism to Homeric theology; or it may take a more peculiarly esthetic turn, such as the alleged reality of the poet's communion with nature. In these forms the argument soon gets out of hand, and this is certainly not the place for extended discussion of the theology of beauty. But since Kant's demolition of the proofs of God's existence, we can not but perceive the weight of his criticism on a theological argument which takes an esthetic turn, not essentially different from the cosmological proof. The argument for a supersensible agent as the creator of natural beauty is, in truth, no argument at all. But what Kant's criticism does not undermine, and what is still to be reckoned with, is the testimony of experience. Here we must tread lightly. The great critic and historian of art, Professor Mather, has a simple, convinc- ing answer to whoever would explain natural beauty in terms of a Supreme Artificer. In a recent volume, he writes: In a case of a devout person, one may say that the esthetic transaction which includes nature is tripartite, God being the Supreme Artificer who has created niatural appearances for our delectation. But such a statement would be subject to restrictions and reservations which practically annul it. A devout person would hardly presume to say that the activities through which he ap- preciates the beauty of nature are identical with or even closely anialogous to the Divine activities in creation. In short, such enijoyment is niot a creating anew.1 There is no unconditional truth in the statement of whoever would have us believe in a superhuman creator of beauty in nature. Even assuming its truth, we may still resolve the issue either by identifying ntatural beauty with the esthetic experience, or by showing that a different relationship obtains in nature-appreciation. It is sometimes asserted that natural beauty exists in its own right, and that in nature we apprehend or recognize beauty without creating it.2 I have argued before 3 that beauty demands expressive- ness which can not adequately be conceived as belonging to a material object per se, but is mind-dependent. It follows then that in insist- ing upon the " reality " of inherent natural beauty as entailing mind, we are thus forced back to some theological argument, in terms of which alone nature could be purposive. Now whether nature is expressive of an artificer or only as a human mind reads its purposes into it, is a moot question, and perhaps one not ultimately answer- able. Since all we must definitively assert is that for esthetic ap- preciation nature is expressive, we may without violence side-step the ultimate issue. There is a serious ambiguity of attributing to nature expressive 'Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., Concerning Beauty, p. 61. 2 Cf. L. A. Reid, A Study in Aesthetics, p. 391. 3 This JOURNAL, Vol. XXXII (1935), pp. 596 ff.</page><page sequence="3">654 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY powers which rightfully belong only to conscious activity. From our intimate intercourse with nature we undoubtedly tend to make it stand for our own sentiments. Xenophanes long ago laid bare the pathetic fallacy, and though we may intellectually appreciate his well-directed criticism, few of us can withstand projecting our own sentiments into nature. We congratulate ourselves on recognizing primitive anthropomorphism; we can perhaps disengage ourselves from the belief that the lightning is the Greek god's hurtling battle- axes or that the wind is their breath blown from puffed cheeks; yet we secretly believe that the wind moans in the forest or that there is a hidden dance and musical motion of electrons, as Professor Laird has suggested.4 It is not for us to say what nature must or must not be; but more precision in thought is necessary. So-called tertiary qualities sun- dered from all consciously active agents are esthetically sterile. Only as linked with mental life and as satisfying or dissatisfying, does esthetic value arise. Poetry is made concrete by allusions to nature; nature is made poetic as expressed for mind. The Rock of Gibraltar or the Grand Tetons may express steadfastness and reliability. As natural ob- jects they may be no more than physically rigid formations. But mere immobility and rigidity are not esthetic. To think of a con- scious being expressing steadfastness is not to think him an insensible, immovable rock. A rigid body may assist expression, but only in so far as it is of inner determination to which we can accord dignity. It may be argued that we have accepted an indefensible concep- tion of nature, which perforce excludes beauty. That may be true, and we need hold no brief for the correctness of a physical descrip- tion of nature as disclosing the real. Suppose, then, we consider natural objects to be inherently spiritual, thus taking the form of something like Leibnitzian monads. Then, of course, it may be held that these things are beautiful in themselves, and that we recognize their value, and do not impute it to them. Natural beauty, thus conceived, is not different in principle from recognizing the esthetic experience itself, and analysis of the one is virtually analysis of the other. This identification of natural beauty with the esthetic experi- ence is plausible, and by the nature of the case we can not ask for more. Although it may be presumptuous to pretend to know such a spirit, it is equally presumptuous to assert that this sort of beauty has no analogy to that which is constituted by the esthetic relation of the human mind to its object. Nature's inherent beauty must be similar to that of the esthetic experience, or it is not as we know it. In principle, it is not different from the dancer's experience of her 4 John Laird, A Study in Moral Theory, pp. 100-101.</page><page sequence="4">BEAUTY AND NATURE 655 own rhythmical motions. No intrinsic beauty can belong to nature unless consciousness too is there. II We have now to consider the more difficult problem of the relation of natural beauty to us and whether this relation is esthetic. The problem in its two important phases may be stated more specifically as follows: first, whether the recognition-of-natural-beauty constitutes an esthetic relationship, and secondly, whether imputation is always necessary. Our thesis is that the relation of recognition is different from the esthetic relation of subject to object. Beauty so conceived lies wholly in one term of the relations; i.e., the object of nature, but neither pertains to nor is constituted by the recognizing mind. To be sure, the relationship contains an intrinsic value, but so conceived, the value resides solely in the object-term. The relation is simply that of a mind knowing its object, an object which in the case is extremely complex, containing esthetic value in itself. But the mind which knows it knows it as a fact; the relation as such is not pur- posive, and the knowing mind need take no esthetic delight in its recognition of the structure of natural beauty. Its attitude is what Alexander would call the "angel's point of view" or what we might more simply designate merely as disinterested observation, quite analogous to introspecting our own esthetic experiences. We must respect the distinction between intellectual recognition of things-as- beautiful, and the esthetic appreciation which makes things beau- tiful. If, then, nature is to funetion as an object of beauty which an individual appreciates, to its esthetic surfaces must be imputed ex- pressiveness which satisfactorily consummates the esthetic experience. Now it may be contended that this expression is realized within na- ture as well as in our relation to it. Would not this view then deny that of esthetic imputation, for if the expression already belongs to nature we can not impute it? The question is not easy to answer, but it is more of a psychological concern than a theoretical difficulty. Recognition is not the esthetic relation; but as for imputation being otiose, we can see that this could be so, only when the expression belonging to the object in its own right is absolutely identical with that which mind would express. From the character of esthetic expression, such identity seems highly improbable. Moreover, as Alexander observes, in our zeal to learn whether nature is of herself beautiful, there is for esthetic appreciation a practical danger which tends to dissipate the esthetic experience.</page><page sequence="5">656 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY For if we gain this knowledge it may be at the expense of losing esthetic value. Concerning imputation and recognition, he writes: But in the first place we read the feeling or character into these forms before we learln that the creatures in question possess them; alnd in the lnext place though a natural form may thus in reality happen to possess the supple- melnt which we add from our minds, alnd may so far be unlike the work of art, yet the intellectual recognition that it does conform to the esthetic appreciation is niot itself esthetic. . . . But also the klnowledge that the natural object possesses the imputed characters,-which is wsthetically indifferent,-may even mar the esthetical effect, for wheni we learn that a mani is really as filne a character as he looks, our appreciatioln is apt to turn to moral ilnstead of awsthetic admiration.5 Assuming that there is beauty in nature, the point that objective recognition of it may turn the mind to moral or scientific apprecia- tion, instead of esthetic, can not be overemphasized. The weight of evidence formidably challenges any assertion that the esthetic experience is cognitive alone. Irrelevant to mere appre- hension, affective processes would have to be disregarded in the alleged perception of beauty in nature, and forthwith esthetic value is destroyed. III We come now to our second main problem: if nature is not purpo- sive and no artistic imprint is left, such as there seems to be in art, how can we make it esthetically expressive? Our answer to this question can be given largely by dispelling certain misconceptions of art, indicating (a) that it may be spurious, (b) that it has a close affiliation with nature, and (c) that nature is "framed" in much the same fashion as art. (a) Today we can no longer be in doubt that frauds are some- times perpetrated upon art-lovers. Pigments are literally thrown upon canvases and words bandied about with no other intent than that of duping one into believing that they constitute art. There is no end to forcing upon our attention shams which the author perhaps himself recognizes to be only so much pap, having sale value. When a museum can hang a prize painting turned sideways, instead of right side up, and when the connoisseurs proclaim it a great work, the significance of such misjudgments is patent. First, it is vividly brought home that the difference between art and nature may be no more than that between things formed by man and things formed by non-human processes. Secondly, the presumption that objets d'art have intrinsic esthetic value must be justified. We might attempt to use the sleuth's strong-arm method of extorting a confession from the fabricator; yet this could not but prove futile. Though the 5 Space, Time, and Deity, Vol. II, p. 289.</page><page sequence="6">BEAUTY AND NATURE 657 probability is extremely small, still the splotch-work done as a fraud might unintentionally be a masterpiece. The ingenious statistician has calculated that it would take a million monkeys jumping on a million typewriters a million years to pound out Shakespeare's plays; there is perhaps the same probability that any particular splotch- work may turn out to be esthetically significant-always a possi- bility, however small. There is, in truth, only one genuine method of detecting esthetic- ally significant objects: that of immediate experience as satisfying the imagination. If we are to guard ourselves against insincerity, we can judge only by the sensuous perception of the thing as ex- pressing for us esthetic worth. Otherwise, we fall back upon second- ary criteria of doubtful validity. The only genuine criterion is that of experience in terms of which we answer the question: Can this object express esthetic value for me? When we thus reject second- ary criteria for judging art, the distinction between art and nature tends to dissolve. (b) Moreover, the esthetically functioning materials of art and nature are not essentially different. There is no point in denying the greater intensity of perceptions of nature. For example, pig- ments can never begin to approach the luminosity of the sun, but since art is not imitation, there is no reason why it should attempt faithfully to reproduce nature. The painter develops his own tech- nique by which he is able to express his intent. Further, art can not possibly exploit the multitude of concurring impressions we get from nature. Painting is predominantly visual; music, auditory; but no art has successfully exploited thermal, olfactory, gustatory sensations, etc. Nature and art are none the less closely wedded. The artist constantly refers to nature for materials and renewed in- spiration, and nature in turn becomes more significant through the handiwork of a Breughel, a Wordsworth, a Debussy. In fine, the worth of both art and nature is enhanced by their mutual refer- ences. (c) Still, must we not recognize that art is always in some kind of a frame, that its bounds are always more or less clearly defined, while nature has no frame and has no bounds? Now this charge against nature might seem to be serious and indicate an entirely dif- ferent sort of appreciation. Although some forms of nature-ap- preciation may not be esthetic at all, still where we attribute beauty to it there seems to be no fundamental difference from art. In the first place, the contention that art is in a "frame " is not at all obvious. Greek tragedy is none too intelligible without its preceding argument. The Greek citizen, more familiar with his mythology than we are with the Bible, must have felt a continuity in</page><page sequence="7">658 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the tragedies, which we can get only with diligent study from ex- traneous sources. Surely no one can doubt that the myths are part and parcel of the tragedies; they give them an historical perspective and orientation without which the dramas would be woefully de- nuded. Even though the dramatist includes much of the relevant myth, the drama's full significance requires an historical background which can be consistently imputed to it. The same applies to medi- eval art, to oriental art, as well as to Elizabethan and Victorian- not in the sense of mere chronological history, but as pivotal to the re-creation of specious moments. Or again, a master like Rodin consciously obliterates the frame when he makes his works grow from partially unhewn stone. Here the continuity of nature and art overshadows its supposed discrete- ness. Sculpturing carved from mountains-and it may not be grotesque and jarring-further tends to blot out the distinction. Or Tschaikowsky's Pathe'tique ending with a long, sustained note in the bass, gives the impression of reaching out to infinity, despite the abrupt, disconcerting applause of over-enthusiastic audiences. In- stances could be multiplied indefinitely, but these should suffice to show that it is not at all clear that art always has a frame which strictly bounds it. If, on the one hand, art is not always definitely bounded, on the other, we tend to frame nature. Our selection and rearrangement make of it a virtual artifact, tantamount to creation. Even the photographer, as Griggs has pointed out,6 places his tripod in the most advantageous position for light and shadow effects, excluding the irrelevant and including only the harmonious. No one can deny that there is an art of photography. Our selection and reconstruc- tion of nature may be for the most part immediate and only half- conscious, but still it involves rudimentary creation. Alexander writes: natural beauty "is itself creation, creation in the less exact- ing form of selection. . . . We find nature beautiful not because she is beautiful herself but because we select and combine, as the artist does more plainly when he works with pigments. " 7 The immediacy and unreflectiveness of our selection of natural beauties tend, in truth, to make us consider the beauty of nature objective and quite independent of mind. Our satisfaction unpremeditated and our judgments univocal, we think that we have not participated in the creative process. But newer evidence in the psychology of percep- tion leads us to believe that we are creators, however humble, in se- lecting and arranging objects in esthetic appreciation of nature. If we have no frame for nature, at least our perceptions are fo- 6 The Philosophy of Art, pp. 41 ff. 7 Beauty and Other Forms of Value, p. 30.</page><page sequence="8">BEAUTY AND NATURE 659 cussed upon the relevant esthetic surfaces. Our peripheral vision may be blurred; yet this is not different from our peripheral vision of the gothic cathedral or of the framed canvas on the gallery wall. The museum director knows that paintings must be hung upon a neutral background, and that they must be spaced so as not to induce inhibitory effects. Apparently, we are again justified in tearing down the artificial barrier between art and nature. The frame of art has been unduly, and without reason, emphasized, and the crea- tive work of mind in nature underestimated. There seems to be a continuity between nature- and art-appreciation, and where there is a difference it is one of degree rather than kind. Objectively, all that is required is a sense-presentation; whether it is fabricated by man or whether it is the appearance of a natural thing makes no difference so long as it can be the bearer of esthetic meaning. Log- ically, we have no more right in justifying art than nature as pur- posively intended; perhaps there is more of a presumption for art, but the sole genuine verification is in immediate esthetic experience alone. The sufficiently empirical-minded may wish to pursue the subject to greater lengths, establishing once and for all the superiority of either art or nature. There is perhaps some justification for assert- ing that as regards purity of experience art is manifestly superior; whereas esthetic experiences of nature are more intense, more vivid and arresting, with an infinitely greater multitude of presentations, though perhaps somewhat less coherent than in art. In the final analysis, we are forced to compare not art and nature, but individual experiences of them. We might then generalize the "by and large," though it is hardly significant to pursue such a research. IV Our analysis has attempted to show the identity between esthetic enjoyment of nature and of art, both of which, we contend, entail like terms and like principles, at least as regards appreciation. There is, of course, the difference that nature is not manifestly cre- ated by an artificer. If we wish, we may assume a Supreme Arti- ficer, but this brings us no nearer a solution to our problem; for a theological turn only complicates the issue without shedding light upon our appreciation of nature. When nature is conceived to be physical, it can be appreciated as beautiful only in virtue of empathic imputation as satisfying imagination. If, however, nature is conceived to be some sort of Leibnitzian monads, objectively expressing themselves, natural things may be inherently beautiful. But then they are analogues of</page><page sequence="9">660 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY the esthetic experience. In such a case, while imputation is otiose, our experience is not esthetic but turns towards the intellectual, in which we apprehend, rather than appreciate, esthetic value. The distinction between recognition and enjoyment must not be blurred. Finally, our contention is that imputation in nature-appreciation is not different from that in art. The argument from the artist's intent rests upon secondary criteria which can be justified only by reference to immediate experience. Frauds and spurious art testify that the only genuine guarantee is the esthetic enjoyment which we can ourselves derive from the work of art. Unanimity of judgment makes for a presumption of real art, but verification can rest only with individual experience. The intimate interrelation of art and nature further obliterates any rigid distinction. And finally, the contention that art is in a frame, nature not, is a lingering prejudice, by no means established. The frame of art is often obscured; and the perceptual processes make for a unity in our esthetic experiences of nature. Beauty of nature requires us to be artists, and in many instances more creative ones than we are as art-appreciators. But structur- ally, there is a pervading pattern in both, whereby an object fulfills purposive expression. In either it may be more or less inchoate and unreflective or it may be highly articulate and critical; but natural or artificial pigmentation may yield to esthetic satisfaction. BERTRAM MORRIS.
