<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ex-Voto: Image, Organ, Time Georges Didi-Huberman VOTIVE IMAGES ARE ORGANIC, vulgar, as disagreeable to con template as they are abundant and diffuse. They cut across time. They are common to highly disparate civilisations. They disregard the cleavage of paganism and Christianity. In reality, this very diffuseness consti tutes their mystery and their epistemological singularity: trite objects for the ethnologist, votive images seem simply not to exist at all for the art historian. Their aesthetic mediocrity, their formulaic and stereotypical character, sets them apart from any 'grand' history of style. But this insignificance creates a screen, allowing these dregs to go unobserved. One should not speak of insignificance but of discomfort and crisis: the discomfort produced by the organic vulgarity of devotional images; the crisis they provoke in the aesthetic model of art that hails from the academies and from normative criticism, in the positivist model of history as a continuous narrative chain and a family romance of 'influences'. Votive forms are capable of both disappearing for a very long time and reappearing when one least expects it.1 They are just as capable of resisting any perceptible evolution. Some authors trace the features that one finds in certain sanctuaries of Christianity—such as the accumulations of handprints on the walls of reli gious buildings—back to the Upper Paleolithic era.2 It matters little, for our purposes, to know exactly how far back votive rituals go: it suffices for us to state that the typical forms of the ex-voto, such as the anatomical forms, have practically never evolved—neither in size, nor in the choice of materials, nor in the techniques of manufacture, nor even in the 'style' of figuration, which it would be better to qualify as a formal insensibility to any affirmation of style—from Greek, Etruscan or Roman Antiquity, to what we can still observe today in the Christian sanctuaries of Cyprus, Bavaria, Italy or the Iberian Peninsula.3 This does not mean that the ex-voto has no history: certain muta tions in devotional culture were able to modify the very idea of the "votive contract," as analysed by André Vauchez for the thirteenth and fourteenth cen turies, for example.4 But it also means that this history must give an account of a different temporality that, within it, insists and resists every chronology of evolution or 'progress'. In his foundational text on the Histoire du portrait en cire, Schlosser described this resistance in terms of universal psychologi cal foundations: "It is, again, ultimately a question of very primitive ideas, © L'Esprit Créateur, Vol. 47, No. 3 (2007), pp. 7-16</page><page sequence="2">L'Esprit Créateur rooted deep in a human, all-too-human essence across every time and every country." ["£s sind im Grand wieder ganz primitive Vorstellungen, die tief in menschlichen, allzumenschlichen We sen aller Zeiten und Lander wiirzeln."]5 Ideas, or rather "very primitive representations"? We are not spontaneously in tune with the secret of "very primitive representations," irrespective of whether they might be active in our own present. But we are faced with reified representations, or more precisely with objects that are constituted psychically by the votive bond. Things deposited in sanctuaries out of votive gratitude are always objects that have been touched by a sovereign event, by a symptom', the suffering of misfortune or the sudden transformation of misfortune into mira cle, illness into health, and so on. In short, it is almost always a relic, the relief of a psychically processed organic ordeal·, crutches, walking sticks, prisoners' chains, shackles, instruments of torture, stretchers, medical prostheses, funeral biers, shrouds, the boards of people without legs, objects responsible for all manner of wounds, arrowheads, swallowed pins... Or else objects that acquire psychic significance by the fact of being given, in the sense that, in 'devoting' them, the giver indicates that he holds them dear, that he is beholden to them: clothes, agricultural products, specially made loaves or cakes, live beasts, precious objects, coins, body parts (such as hair), right up to the children who, in the Middle Ages, were offered up, 'given' to the Church.6 But it was through a material that Schlosser approached the votive forms and their remarkable resistance to the stylistic avatars of the history of art. His intuition—which was also that of Spire Blondel and Gaston Le Breton before him7—finds confirmation in the recent research of historians of the Middle Ages: "The wax ex-voto," writes Pierre-André Sigal in particular—"is strik ingly predominant in the Middle Ages."8 Schlosser did not seek fully to prob lematise this privileging of the material: it was enough for him to orientate it in the direction of realist portraiture. Would it not be useful, however, to seek to understand why wax and, less importantly, papier mâché, clay, softwood, and beaten silver leaf should have almost exclusively constituted the appro priate materials of the votive offering? Understanding this privileging better would help us understand better what is at stake symbolically and fantasmat ically, temporally and ftgurally, in plasticity. That wax is a material endowed with plasticity signifies that it is spon taneously devoted to the fabrication of images. The crutch offered to a god is an object that remains what it is; the wax leg though is a transformable image. We pass from contagious to imitative magic without, moreover, the one ever being entirely absent from the field of efficacity that the other sets to work.9 In this passage, what is in theory lost—the object bearing presence and approxi Fall 2007</page><page sequence="3">Georges Didi-Huberman mating the relic, the image, on the other hand, keeping its distance—is com pensated for by considerable practical, or to put it better, fantasmatic gains. Pri marily, the wax allows a psychic temporal gain: the lame, plainly, can give their crutch only in gratitude, once the miracle has taken place, which is to say in the time of the satisfaction of the vow; whereas the image can offer itself equally in propitiation, in a time of expectation and unfulfilled desire. The lame will keep their crutch to walk as best they can, while offering a leg of wax to incarnate their vow to walk as one should. In this sense, wax allows the extension and even the constitution of the time of the vow: it adapts itself plas tically to misfortunes and to prayers, it can change when symptoms and desires change. If the lame find themselves healed in the leg but succumb to a bad dose of pneumonia, they can always melt down their wax leg and use the recovered material to make a beautiful pair of votive lungs... It will, I think, be understood that the 'immobile' or—stylistically speak ing—'resistant' time of votive forms is only the other side of a use-value that appears as perpetually open, available, mobilisable. Wax, as the material of all manner of plasticities, lends itself perfectly to all the labilities of the symptom that the votive object tries magically to involute, to heal, to transfigure. Wax appears and disappears, it can constantly reappear in new organic fixations. It is polyvalent, reproducible, and metamorphic, exactly like the symptoms it is charged with representing, on one hand, and warding off, on the other. Now, in this constant metamorphosis, it ceaselessly affirms its indestructible reference to what all this has in common: one might say it permits a gain of flesh, this flesh that it so perfectly imitates and to which it so obstinately returns... This flesh for which it substitutes and which it makes subsist: through imitation, of course, but also through contagion, since it defines itself as an organic mate rial—a malleable 'flesh' mysteriously issued from the bodies of bees—and since its plasticity comes to it from the 'life' that is conferred on it by the simple warmth of our hands. A gain of time and a gain of flesh: the wax material already reveals its capacity to function psychically as a material of desire. This, more than anything, defines the votive form as such: that it takes the form of a vow and, beyond that, of a desire. That it is capable of giving form— an organic form—to psychic time. Its representational value is of course fun damental, but it does not reveal the stakes, the final cause, the very necessity, of the figurative effort. Before representing anyone, the ex-voto represents someone's symptom and prayer: what the giver models in wax is primarily the site of his suffering and where he wants to be transformed, soothed, healed, converted. It is primarily where he is put to the test in the flesh. In his book, Schlosser so rapidly evokes the votive forms not related to portraiture that one Vol. 47, No. 3</page><page sequence="4">L'Esprit Créateur comes away with the impression of an evolutionist schema that runs from the effigy in general (Abbild) to the portrait as such (Bildnis), which is to say to the "most faithful possible representation of the donor" (Schlosser 71). In this schema, the medieval examples cited by Schlosser—Popes Gregory XI and Clement VI in the 13th and 14th centuries, Kings Edward I of England and Charles VI of France, the Count of Artois and the Duke of Burgundy (71 72)—all apparently tend toward the Renaissance culmination that is the famous series of Florentine botî, "the most perfect example of its genre" (75 77). In the analysis of this "perfect example," Schlosser usefully expands upon remarks made in 1902 by Aby Warburg, denouncing in passing Vasari's distortions and forcefully suggesting the role of votive practices in the prop erly artistic emergence of the autonomous sculpted portrait (86-93).10 But the artistic and historical orientation of Schlosser's analysis, his uni lateral attention to the genre of portraiture, somewhat obfuscate the complex ity of the relations set to work in votive forms. All the objects of the Santis sima Annunziata having been destroyed—in the 17th then in the 18th centuries—Schlosser evokes by way of equivalences or vestiges three other cases of votive effigies: the statue of Leonard von Gôrz, in Innsbruck (late 15th century), whose polychrome hands and face are carved from wood, the rest of the body being made from wax on a wooden core; the slightly later effi gies of Santa Maria delle Grazie, near Mantua, "though these are statues in papier mâché, of lesser artistic value and from a lower era" (Schlosser 77); finally, the "clothed, life-sized figures in wax" of the sanctuary of Vierzehn heiligen, in Bavaria, which Schlosser describes as "a modern counterpart for the botî of the Annunziata" (80)." In all of these examples, the unity of portraiture as a genre is accordingly upheld. Schlosser does not say that beside the six hundred Florentine effigies inventoried in 1630 were also found at least twenty-two thousand anatomical ex-votos;12 that the figures of Santa Maria delle Grazie are surrounded, almost overrun, by a "rockery" of thousands of stereotypical ex-votos; that the Bavarian sanctuaries constitute a whole world of forms of which portraiture, in the strict sense, is only one segmented aspect. Schlosser, however, has read and cited the foundational book by Richard Andree on votive practices in southern Germany.13 This book contains a whole range of extraordinary forms modelled in wax, for example isolated jawbones and ears, tracheas, hearts, and even two life-sized testicles, one of which is suffering from hypertrophy (Andree 111 and plate XVII). Beyond classic portraiture, should we not accept that a hypertrophic testicle represents its donor no less than a meticu lously imitated wart on a face? That a subject is individualised by the features 10 Fall 2007</page><page sequence="5">Georges Didi-Huberman of his malady no less than by the features of his face? Should we not also accept—beyond any evolutionary schema that tends solely toward the emer gence of the 'autonomous portrait'—that the hypertrophic testicle possesses the same votive function as a ceremonial effigy, and that in any case the latter should be thought in its structural and differential relation to the former? A synchronic point of view regarding the ex-voto is all the more necessary in that apparently antithetical forms coexist throughout history, at the same times and in the same places. Amongst the very rare wax devotional objects that have come down to us from the 15th century—and which Schlosser could not have known—the group found in 1943 in Exeter cathedral, above the tomb of a bishop, appears significant. These are scattered fragments in which one can recognise at least two scales, hence two types of extremely différent image: small-scale figurines coexist with life-sized anatomical fragments.14 In the Middle Ages and during the Renaissance, the same Christian sanctuaries, notably those in Italy, exhibited under the same denominations—vota, votorum munera, ojferenda, xenia, oblationes, munuscula (Bautier 239)—objects that we today call portraits, alongside others which, although they are strictly equivalent from the functional point of view, we would rather see just as loaves of wax, raw and vulgar masses deposited votively. It is therefore not only in terms of evolution, but also in terms of structural polarities, that we must examine votive forms. Let us note that Schlosser is not entirely insensitive to this point of view: having already noted that the wax portrait could be accorded antithetical values of commemoration and infamy, that moulding techniques could support the antithetical values of truth and deception, the historian delib erated over the paradox that makes the ex-voto an act of narcissistic ostenta tion as much as one of "ascetic" humility (Schlosser 9, 29, 72). But how can we understand the coexistence, and even the anthropological equivalence, of a mass of wax silently pressed out on the floor and a wax sur face rhetorically erected into a form of devout mimicry, even into the liturgical gesturings of a whole effigy? The history of art does not help us much in this effort; at most, it will deign to consider the wax surface as belonging to an artistic genre—portraiture—, but it will certainly not deign to let the formless mass into its real or imaginary museum of the history of styles. However, the two objects form a system and reciprocally shed light on one another. Some thing of their respective necessity can be understood by approaching votive forms as a whole as a heuristic field in perpetual constitution: a heuristics of meaning, but also, since it is a matter of figurative images, a heuristics of resemblance. The typologies of ex-votos meticulously described by histori ans—I think above all, for the Middle Ages, of the works of Anne-Marie Bau Vol. 47, No. 3 Π</page><page sequence="6">L'Esprit Créateur tier and Pierre-André Sigal—reveal a strong coherence once one uncovers their systematic exploration of all the ways in which a plastic form can signify a vow by representing the affliction of which a subject begs his god to rid him. Spontaneously to affirm that only the wax surface modelled or moulded on the face of its donor constitutes a likeness is to exhibit a highly restricted view of the operational field of resemblance: it is precisely to ignore that resemblance forms a field and admits of a plurality of objects, criteria, media, and operations.15 The mass of raw, un worked, non-figurative wax—a type of ex-voto known to exist in the West since at least the 9th century—can set to work extremely precise criteria of resemblance just as relevant as the facial features; beside the conventional votive offerings that are the small-scale cerei moduli, donors would deposit massae cerae of their own weight.16 This prac tice, called contrepoids in French since the Middle Ages, still exists in the Mediterranean basin, just as does the ritual weighing of children one seeks to save from some form of illness: the child is placed on one side of the scales and, on the other side, the votive wax is piled up until it reaches the exact weight of the suffering body.17 Is this not as exact and organic a resemblance as reproduction through contact with the facial features? The votive practice of contrepoids is characterised by a kind of explo ration of relations of significance and resemblance. In Peircian terms, one would say that the mass of wax "signifies" its donor by means of an indexi cal type of relation. And that it "resembles" by means of a criteriological choice that makes resemblance a quality internal to the material: a secret but extremely precise quality, directly linked to the compactness, to the density of the material (formally speaking, seventy kilograms of wax has nothing in common with seventy kilograms of wheat). It is this quality, however, that will give the formless mass its incontestable 'individuality', its organic aura, its 'magic' efficacity. One should also note that it is often this genre of rela tions that votive forms appear to mobilise. The offering of candles doubtless has to do with a type of symbolic meaning, directly linked to the liturgy, but when the candles are dedicated ad mensuram corporis ou secundum longi tudinem—which is to say in a size matching that of the donor (Bautier 246 53)—the indexical resemblance, whether by direct contact or mechanical transfer, retains all its power. The pilgrims of the Middle Ages often offered what they called "mon gros et long": it was a candle as long as they were, but also as "thick," a candle of their stature that public disasters could stretch to the dimensions of a whole town, as when devoting a candle—coiled in on itself and burning for days—the length of the city walls, as was often done in times of plague to protect the population as a whole.18 12 Fall 2007</page><page sequence="7">Georges Didi-Huberman In reality, the structural binome of mass and surface only indicates the outer limits of a field of resemblance systematically explored by votive forms. The ex-voto of a head is not inescapably destined to have the sense of a cere monial portrait, as in the case of the Florentine boti. It might be thought of as a pure organic resemblance, which is to say as the representation of a suffer ing organ—just a head subject to migraines. In this case, it becomes a matter of producing resemblances that are cut and reframed in line with the limits of the symptom, resemblances most often produced to the actual size of hands, arms, legs, feet, ears, etc.19 Someone who suffers in the right side of their chest will dedicate an ex-voto representing only the right side of a bust.20 And if they suffer to the very depths of their lungs or their guts, they will not hes itate to sculpt organic forms of them, half-observed and half-imagined.21 The anatomical ex-voto thus presents itself as a fragment, cut out in accor dance with the fault-lines of the symptom itself. Its actual size often takes on the meaning of a survival or of an imitation of the protocols of the imprint, the suffering organ being, if possible, directly moulded in order to be devoted with greater precision and auratic intensity.22 Inversely, all-encompassing rep resentations—figures of the whole body or scenes of miracles—are generally subject to the shrinking of scale required by the figurine or the tableautin. As it becomes narrativised, the ex-voto tends to reduce its organic weight, its encumbrance, its suffocating presence. It becomes somehow civilised, accedes to the status of a substitutable object, an object of furniture. One could say, in Peircian terms, that the indexical ends up giving way to the iconic and symbolic. But this proposition remains insufficient: we should never lose sight of the essential contamination of different types of resem blances, which make votive forms the "living mass, formless and inorganic" of which Mauss spoke so well in relation to magic in general.23 When the votive candle or the effigy is made to the weight of the donor, when the painted image is realised in the size of one who has been miraculously cured (Sigal 18-20 and 30), it is because the liturgical "symbol" and the realistic "icon" remain powerfully contaminated by the question of contact. The natu ral size of the most naturalistic effigies—which supposes the possibility, even the requirement, that they be dressed in the real clothes of the donors24—is not therefore a simple choice of optical resemblance. It exhibits the persistent power of resemblances through contact or through contagion. The heuristics of resemblances—which I hope is a more operative way of naming their veiy strategic contaminations—thus characterises votive forms over the long run.25 This is why it is so difficult to envisage these forms from the perspective of a simple history of styles. Every image, in this area, is charged Vol. 47, No. 3 13</page><page sequence="8">L'Esprit Créateur with conjoining, with manipulating at one and the same time, both a highly sym bolic or contractual aspect, on one hand (the relation to the Other, the relation do ut des: I give the representation of my symptom so that You might give the real ity of its healing) and, on the other hand, the always very immediate and real, very carnal, aspect of the votive situation {my suffering organ, my clothes here on the effigy, the material reliefs of this symptom, of that miracle).26 André Leroi Gouran expressed well the extraordinary persistence through time of those tech nical forms that are directly linked to the human body: thus, the general structure of the knife remains practically unchanged since the carved flints of Prehistory.27 We must make an analogous remark concerning votive forms: their essential anthropomorphism—which, as will by now be understood, has nothing to do with a more or less 'figurative' stylistic choice—makes these forms things that are 'everywhere escaping and everywhere similar to themselves', types of phan toms-, in short. They are not initially very easy to discern: the history of art ignores them and ethnology scarcely professes to analyse them formally. They are there, however, in us and around us, ghosts returning, surviving or living on.28 They insist in phantasms, in the extreme plasticity of the psychically figurable, and in materials physically gifted with plasticity: this is why wax has welcomed them so well and for such a long time.
