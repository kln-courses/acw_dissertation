Greenwood, Dept of Adult and Continuing Education, Univ. of Durham, Durham DHI 3JB, England Jonathan Adams, Dept of Adult and Continuing Education, Univ. of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, England In many species of Gammarus (Amphipoda) the male carries the female for up to a week before mating with her just after she moults. Males are typically 1.3 times longer or twice as heavy as the female they carry (Birk- head and Clarkson 1980, Adams and Greenwood 1983). Recently Ward (1986) concluded that sexual selection, in the form of male-male competition, is an adequate explanation for larger male size. We can find no evi- dence in Ward's paper to support his assertion and we believe his view of sexual size dimorphism reflects a widespread biological misconception. Darwin (1871: 256) invoked sexual selection to ac- count for the evolution of characteristics which confer an 'advantage which certain individuals have over other individuals of the same sex and species, in exclusive re- lation to reproduction'. When, for example, males com- pete for access to females there may be selection for fighting or other competitive abilities which result in larger males having a reproductive advantage over smaller ones. If larger individuals are more successful and size is heritable then male size will increase in time until checked by natural selection. Recently, extrapolations of Darwin's ideas have led to a matching pair of fallacious assumptions. First, that if large size is advantageous in male-male competition then males must inevitably evolve to be larger than fe- males. Second, that if males are larger than females then this must inevitably be because of the advantage of large size in male-male competition. Neither assump- tion, as we will outline, is necessarily the case. But per- haps one reason for these assumptions stems from the emphasis of these recent studies on the importance of male-male competition in birds and mammals and its probable effects on male size. The higher vertebrates are atypical of the Animal Kingdom in the extent to which males are usually the larger sex: 20 out of 25 Orders of birds (2 Orders are not included as the trend is unclear); 16 out of 20 Orders of mammals (Greenwood and Wheeler 1985). In these taxa there is evidence that the relative dimorphism may be further increased by sexual selection. For example, the more polygynous species of grouse, ungulates, pin- nipeds and primates show marked size differences be- tween the sexes and, in some cases, the occurrence of elaborate male weaponry such as antlers in ungulates and large canines in primates (Clutton-Brock and Har- vey 1977, Alexander et al. 1978). It is usually assumed that male size will have a major influence on reproduc- tive success. Amongst the remainder of the Animal Kingdom larger female size is the norm and not the exception (Darwin 1871, Ghiselin 1974, Greenwood and Wheeler 1985). Yet, in many of these species, there is evidence of a high level of male-male competition. Common toads Bufo bufo form precopula pairs in which the male rides on the back of the female he guards. Davies and Halliday (1977) demonstrated experimentally that larger males can displace smaller rivals from precopula. Yet, despite this advantage of large size, B. bufo follows the Class trend and males are still the smaller sex. There are similar examples from invertebrates. In Stego- phryxus hyptius (Isopoda, Bopyridae) males aggres- sively displace one another from hosts, yet resident males are minute and small enough to live inside the fe- male's brood pouch (Reinhard 1949). Similarly in the web-building spider Nephila clavipes males compete for females and fights are generally won by the larger com- petitor (Vollrath 1980). Nonetheless, the female is much larger than the male: a pattern almost universal in that Order. Thus, when the larger males are more suc- cessful in intra-sexual competition this indicates an ad- vantage for a particular male size relative to that of OIKOS 48:1 (1987)  106</page><page sequence="2">other males. We have learnt nothing about the size of males relative to females. However, we may be able to deduce how large the male ought to be relative to the female, irrespective of the presence or absence of male-male competition, when there is a loading interaction between the sexes. Such an interaction entails one sex carrying the other before, during or after copulation, a situation which is a frequent occurrence among animals. In this context it is worth noting that the female is the load-bearing sex in the common toad. But it is when we turn to those spe- cies where males are larger than females and also the load-bearing sex that we find male-male competition is often unnecessarily invoked as the explanation for the pattern. Among freshwater Asellus (Isopoda) the probability of a guarding male in precopula being replaced by an- other increases with the size-ratio of the added/guarding male. Ridley and Thompson (1979) interpreted this as evidence for a competitive advantage for large males al- though they only once recorded enforced takeover. We suggested that the evolution of larger males might be at- tributable to a loading constraint (Adams et al. 1985). We found that relatively large males can move faster against a uniform constraint than males matched more closely with their partner's size. Similarly, male sea-slaters Ligia pallasii (Isopoda) are much larger than females. They are also dispropor- tionately wider. Carefoot (1973) notes that in paired an- imals the female is always held under the male's body and suggests (p. 304) 'that this greater width of the male would allow for easier accommodation of the partner'. Ligia forage from crevices across the upper intertidal zone at night and return to their retreats during the day. The size-difference means that 'the male's ability to run is not wholly impeded and ... pairs ... can traverse con- siderable distances'. Amongst the Hymenoptera females are usually larger than males and tow their mate behind them in nuptial flight. In some species, such as the sphecid digger wasp Bembecinus quinquespinosus the male carries the fe- male and mating males are as large as their partners. O'Neill and Evans (1983) suggested that selection press- ure for increased male size is related to flight mechan- ics. They are preceded by Darwin who refers to several species of bee and wasp with large males. His explana- tion for this pattern is that 'the males require great strength and size in order to carry females through the air' (Darwin 1871: 348). Males are the larger sex among many, but not all, Amphipoda. There is no evidence that larger males of either Gammarus pulex (Gammaridae) or Hyalella az- teca (Hyallelidae) are able to displace smaller males from precopula (Birkhead and Clarkson 1980, Strong 1973). However, males may carry their mates in precop- ula for several days and it is thus inevitable that, irre- spective of any other condition, relatively large males will be more effective load carriers than small ones. We have shown that pairs of G. pulex in which the male is much larger than his mate can swim faster than pairs closely matched for size (Adams and Greenwood 1983). This loading constraint will be more severe in streams than in ponds, because of the risks of being washed downstream. The size ratio of pairs formed in an experi- mental stream is larger than that of pairs formed in still water (Greenwood and Adams 1984). We predicted that comparable field samples would show higher size ratios in lotic habitats than in lentic ones. Ward (1986) found that the size ratio of G. pulex in pairs collected from a pond at Raby, Merseyside was 1.40. This is greater than the ratio of 1.3 found in stream populations (Birkhead and Clarkson 1980, Greenwood and Adams 1984) and this would seem to contradict our hypothesis. What is unclear is why Ward (1986) com- pares his Raby pond sample to other, independent stud- ies where the methods of measurement were different, rather than to his Hawarden stream sample where he obtained a size ratio which we calculate to be 1.43 (Ward 1983; Tab. 5.2, n = 983 pairs). He also found a much higher correlation between male and female size in stream pairs than in pond pairs and paired males were larger than unpaired males in the stream but not in the pond. These results may also be consequences of the tighter constraints in the stream. There is a further explanation for these high size ra- tios which has been pointed out by Caroline Naylor (pers. comm.). Robinson and Doyle (1985) have shown that male Gammarus suffer reduced growth rates when in precopula because they are unable to feed. In Raby pond the breeding pattern is highly seasonal, compared with that in Hawarden stream so males are freed from this feeding restriction and grow for longer. Since male growth rates are higher than female Ward should have predicted that size dimorphism would increase under these conditions. There is nothing in Ward's work which cannot be ex- plained by the interaction between growth rates and a constraint on swimming performance. A similar con- straint has been identified elsewhere, in such diverse groups as insects and nematodes, where males carry fe- males. Errors stem from the simple fallacy of seeing larger male size from an anthropomorphic and andro- centric point of view. As we have shown, male-male competition does not inevitably lead to the evolution of relatively larger male size, nor indeed should we expect that when males are the larger sex this is necessarily the product of male-male competition.

Sexual selection and body size in Gammarus pulex: a reply to Greenwood and Adams Paul I. Wardy,Dept of Zoology, Univ. of Edinburgh, West Mains Road, Edinburgh EH9 3JT, Scotland (present address: Abt. Wickler, Max-Planck-Inst. fur Verhaltensphysiologie, D-8131 Seewiesen, FRG) Greenwood and Adams (1987) severely criticise my views on sexual selection and body size in Gammarus pulex (Ward 1986). Let me begin to answer the crit- icisms by quoting two statements by Greenwood and Adams. 'There is nothing in Ward's work which cannot be explained by the interaction between growth rates and a constraint on swimming performance'. 'There is no evidence that larger males of ... Gammarus pulex ... are able to displace smaller males from precopula' (em- phasis added). Taken together these statements imply male-male competition for females is an insignificant factor forming the mating behaviour of G. pulex. I be- lieve this to be untrue because of a number of experi- mental results, cited in my Oikos paper but not by Greenwood and Adams, and because of a re-analysis of my data (Ward unpubl.). These results are evidence for the importance of male-male competition, with en- forced takeover of a paired female by an unpaired male as its extreme expression, and do not seem to me to be consistent with any other explanation. Takeovers occurred in 22% of precopulas in dishes where several males were present, in 9% and 9% in two experiments in cups with two males (Ward 1983) and 6% of pairs split before the female's moult in pairs col- lected in the field and maintained in isolation (Ward 1986). If pairs split because they are misarrorted (sensu Adams and Greenwood 1983), there is no reason for this pattern. Secondly, in observing many hundreds of pairs I have never seen a female paired with one male, unpaired the following day and then paired with a sec- ond male on the third day. This should surely have hap- pened if pairs were splitting for reasons unconnected with the activity of unpaired males. However, both re- sults are consistent with the interpretation that second males forcibly replace original paired males and imme- diately enter precopula with the females. In the experiments with two males and one female in a cup, I found larger males were more likely than smaller ones to replace an already paired male and were also less likely to be replaced once paired (Ward 1983). The second of these results is especially likely to be due to male-male competition. If males release females be- cause they cannot carry them, this should be more likely to happen to smaller rather than larger males. Take- overs are seldom observed directly because they are such rare events. The above experiments involved OIKOS 48:1 (1987)  108</page></plain_text>
