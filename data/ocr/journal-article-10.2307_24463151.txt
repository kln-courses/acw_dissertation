<plain_text><page sequence="1">"His Dearest Mediation:" The Dialogue in Heaven in Book III of Paradise Lost by Randel Helms Doctrinally-based interpretations of the great mediation scene in Book III of Paradise Lost have ranged from the conclusion (based on De Doctrina Christiana) that the scene is "Arian" and "dramatic,"1 to the reading that finds in the passage a "ritual of enacted certainty" in which the Son—sharing omnis cience and knowing beforehand that the Father will ask "Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?"—awaits this "rhetorical question," his cue for responding.2 This paper, in keeping with Professor Rajan's insis tence that we bear in mind the context of the seven teenth-century reader rather than De Doctrina only,3 will attempt a different approach to the dialogue in Book III: an examination, not of Milton's doctrine, but of the biblical models on which he formed the Son's "dearest mediation," and the assumptions about those models in the biblical commentaries of his time. I refer to the commentaries to show not that Milton depended on them for his concept of media tion, but that they embody the Christian common places of his age to which Paradise Lost makes frequent appeal.4 The biblical acts of intercession most closely re lated to the mediation in Book III are Abraham's bar gain with God over the fate of Sodom (Genesis 18) and Moses' plea for Israel after the golden calf (Exo dus 32). In both passages (as in Paradise Lost) the mediator and his God stand on a high place over looking the scene of sin, and in both, the mediator intercedes with eloquent importunity, successfully eliciting divine mercy. Many of the standard com mentaries of Milton's time maintain, however, that in these scenes God in fact intended mercy even be fore the mediator's plea, but desired that His plans be revealed through a righteous intercessor's rise to greatness before the Mercy Seat, and that the scene be recorded for the benefit of posterity. There is much to be learned, from such interpretations, about Milton's construction of Book III. In Genesis, the wickedness of the cities of the plain provokes God to "go down now and see whether they" are indeed as He has heard; but Abraham, mindful of his nephew Lot in Sodom, drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked? Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty . . .? That be far from thee to do after this man ner, to slay the righteous with the wicked; and that the righteous should be as the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right? (Genesis 18:20, 23-25)5 Yahweh agrees, should He find fifty, to "spare all the place for their sakes;" but Abraham is not satis fied: "Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty," "Peradventure there shall be forty," and then thirty, and twenty, so that at last Abraham wearies the Lord into agreeing he "will not destroy it for ten's sake" (Genesis 18:28-32). This strange passage has exer cised commentators for millenia, evoking a traditional interpretation. Already in the second century, Chris tian readers of Genesis had concluded that the divine decision to "go down and see" was in fact for merci ful, not judgmental purposes, being expressly "in tended to teach Abraham the mercy of God," "to 52</page><page sequence="2">teach us that God opened up for the Sodomites the door of repentance," and to allow Abraham to "in tercede ... on their behalf for divine mercy."6 An drew Willet, whose commentaries Milton was advised to read as a youth,7 continues this ancient interpreta tion and notes a parallel mediation familiar also to Milton. 1. Here appeareth the great libertie of speeche, and boldness of the Saints in their praiers: Abraham reneweth his requests 9. times. 2. We see also the goodness of God that cannot withstand the requests of his seruants, nor be offended with their im portunitie ... So Moses, when God had pro posed to destroy Israel, did striue in his praiers, &amp; obtained fauour by his im portunitie.8 Apparently Abraham's intercession in behalf of Sodom formed part of a constellation of biblical mediation scenes in the Renaissance mind that in cluded Moses' on Sinai; so it is not surprising to find that in Book III Milton thought as readily of Moses' intercession for Israel as of Abraham's for Sodom. When Moses stayed overlong on Sinai, the Israelites grew weary waiting for Yawheh to reveal Himself; craving a deity, they moved Aaron to build a golden calf: "and they said, These be thy gods, O Israel." Afterwards, atop Sinai, the LORD said unto Moses, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people: Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them . . . And Moses besought the LORD his God, and said, LORD, why doth thy wrath wax hot against thy people, which thou hast brought forth out of the land of Egypt with great power, and with a mighty hand? Wherefore should the Egyptians speak, and say, For mischief did he bring them out, to slay them in the mountains, and consume them from the face of the earth? Turn from thy fierce wrath, and repent of this evil against thy people. (Exodus 32:4, 9-12) In Book III the Son, like Moses and Abraham before him, asks a series of questions implying that the di vine reputation for goodness and greatness is in volved in the fate of sinful man: is the Adversary to be allowed to gloat that man was created only to be abolished (even, as Moses implies, the Egyptians might vaunt that Israel was freed only to perish in the wilderness)? Or shall the Adversary thus obtain His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfil His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, Or proud return though to his heavier doom, Yet with revenge accomplish't and to Hell Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, By him corrupted? or wilt thou thyself Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, For him, what for thy glory thou hast made? So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be question'd and blasphem'd without defense.9 Reference to Milton's sources, however, does not resolve the question of what is going on between the Father and the Son in Book III. Perhaps a knowl edge of the commonplace conception, in Milton's time, of the nature of the relationship between an importunate intercessor and an angry God will take us closer to a solution. The account of the Lord's anger in Exodus 32 is as troubling to those moderns who worry about anthropomorphism as Milton's "ingrate" passage, partly modelled after it, has been to many readers of Paradise Lost: "Now therefore let me alone, that my wrath may wax hot against them, and that I may consume them." This verse, however, troubled the seventeenth century not at all; indeed Andrew Willet found it a source of comfort: the Lord, by this manner of speech sheweth . . . how much he esteemeth his seruant, as cribing so much to his praiers . . . Some thinke, that the Lord by this speeche should discourage Moses from praying, because their sinne was so great, as the Lord for biddeth Ieremie to pray for the people, Ier. 7. 16. But the Lord rather hereby sheweth that he remembereth his mercie in judge ment, signifying ... that he could be stayed. 4. Yea, hereby he encourageth Moses rather to pray for the people: like as a father being angrie, and making though he would smite his Sonne, saith to one standing by . . . hold me not from smiting, meaning the con trarie, that he would have him interpose himselfe, and mediate for his sonne . . . And now the Lord was contented to accept of Moses prayers, because he was not in his secret counsell appointed to destroy them.10 Willet's interpretation of God's "Now therefore let me alone" (Dimitte me) was a theological common 53</page><page sequence="3">place in the Renaissance, a traditional interpretation that goes at least as far back as Gregory the Great. The commentary of Isidorus Clarius is typical. 10. Dimitte mel Atqui id erat magis pro vocare Mosen ad precandum attentius pro populo. Quocirca &amp; hie &amp; in frequentissimo usu Scripturae observandi sunt loquendi modi. Simul illud observa, quanti apud Deum sint viri boni, quorum tantam ipse rationem habeat." Milton's friend John Diodati says much the same. V. 10. Let me alonel viz. Do not mediate for them. Now by this forbidding, God doth so much the more incite Moses his zeal to pray for the people; shewing him that onely prayer could hinder this lamentable destruction.12 Willet's commentary on Exodus 32:10 ("Now there fore let me alone") is in part a paraphrase of An draeus Rivetus: Dimitte me. inquit Mosi, aut, sine me; quasi disceret, ne resiste mihi, aut ne opponas te furori meo. Sic parens aliquis, adversus im morigerum filium excandescens, &amp; in eum irruere properans, aliquem qui intercederet &amp; eum impedire vellet, talibus verbis af faretur; ne retineas me a percussione improbi &amp; praefracti nebulonis; sine me eum pro meritis excipere, &amp; irae meae semel indulgere; quibus tamen potius contrarium innueret, nempe non ingratum sibi esse si retineatur, ne a filio existimetur parum serio in eo se gessisse parentem; sed quod severius actum non fuerit adversus se, putet aliunde profectum, ne iterum abutatur patris patientia. Recte ergo Interpreter, qui exis timant hoc schemate Deum voluisse charitatem Mosis excitare, ut intercederet pro populo; subindicari ergo clementiam admirabilem Dei, &amp; misericordiam propter Messiam venturum, cum velut arbitrio Mosis relinquitur, ut irasci Dominus per mitttatur [sic]. Recte Gregorius: Quid est servo dicere, dimitte me, nisi deprecandi ansam praebereP13 The violence of God's anger is, as it were, a rhe torical strategy intended expressly to elicit the in tercession of the mediator; even in His wrath there is love. Willet contends that the Creator did not in tend to destroy Israel even as He spoke of "consum ing," for we must understand that the diuine sen tence is of two sorts: one is . . . with a con dition: such was the proclamation against Nineueh, that within fortie daies they should be destroyed, and the message sent by Isaiah to Esekiah that hee should die: for in these sentences there was a secret con dition included, in the one of the Nineuites repentance, in the other of Esekiah's inter cession: so there is a condition understood, that the Lord would be intreated by Moses.14 Christian theology of Milton's time was keen in its appreciation of prevenient grace, and perceptive in its grasp of foreordained mediation (God's nudging an unsuspecting mediator into selfless eloquence). As Willet declares, "most of all, he giueth pardon for the Mediators sake . . . [for] in his secret will he had ordained, that Moses should pray for them, and that hee would be intreated by his prayer."15 Luther, too, remarks the pleasure the Creator must have felt at the intensity of Abraham's concern for the justly condemned Sodomites, and notes the neatness with which God sets up the possibility of his interceding. "For if Scripture says of God, who knows all things and from whom nothing is hidden, that He came down" to look into Sodom's wickedness, the need less trip, Luther implies, must have been intended to allow Abraham the chance to make "himself the intermediary for these very wicked people, when he intercedes for them . . . Just as his faith has thus far been praised, so now his love toward his enemies will be praised; for there is no greater love than to intercede with God for bloodthirsty enemies." Abra ham's intercession, Luther argues, was precisely what God wanted, for "He is pleased with the fervent prayer in which faith and love are so manifest." Indeed it was the very boldness and persistence of Abraham's petition that so pleased God: "Consider this example, whenever you pray, and learn that persistence is needed in praying. It does not offend God; it pleases him."16 Calvin's commentary on Genesis is (except for its predestinarian coloring) in the same tradition as Luther's and the Syrian Fathers'. God's query "Shall I hide from Abram that thing which I doe?" implies for Calvin no indecision, but rather In that God counselleth in himselfe as a doutfull matter, he doth the same for mans sake. For he hath determined before already what he would doe. But his purpose was after this manner, to make Abraham more attentive to weigh the causes of the de struction of Sodome. And he bringeth two reasons why he maketh his purpose knowen unto him, before he executeth the same. 54</page><page sequence="4">The first is, bicause he vouched safe to give unto him a singular privilege of hon our. The second is, bicause the same should be profitable and fruitefull to instruct the posterities.17 More than a hundred years after Calvin, the Bishop of Ely was saying much the same about Moses' in tercession for Israel, noting of Exodus 32:14 ("And the LORD repented of the evil which he thought to do unto his people") that He did not change his Mind; for there was not a peremptory decree, or definitive Sen tence (as they speak) pronounced against them: but only a signification of what they deserved (v. 10) which, unless it had been for the forenamed Reasons, and Moses his Intercession, he would have inflicted upon them.18 Finally, it is apparent that Milton too held the notion of God's pleasure in presenting a problem or asking a question iO one of His creatures, the answer to which He already knows, simply for the sake of encouraging the one asked to demonstrate, by his answer, his intelligence or competence for some special role. In another scene in Paradise Lost, also modelled on Abraham's intercession, Milton turns this theological notion into poetic strategy, presenting Adam "arguing" with God and "convinc ing" Him he should have a helpmate. In Genesis, Abraham thinks in his heart of the monstrous un likeliness of his close bargaining with God: "Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes ... Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak" (Genesis 18:28, 30). His words echo in Adam's sense of the unseemliness of his own argumentative stance before the Almighty: Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power, My Maker, be propitious while I speak. (VIII, 379-380). God's answer to Adam's plaint ("In solitude/What happiness, who can enjoy alone?") is directly in the expositors' tradition of anticipated importunity: I, ere thou spak'st Knew it not good for Man to be alone, And no such company as then thou saw'st Intended thee, for trial only brought, To see how thou couldst judge of fit and meet. (VIII, 444-449) I think it not too much to say that the mediation in Book III is in this same tradition. The divine speeches culminating in the great question "Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?" serve the same func tion as the Dimitte me and Descendant nunc of the Old Testament: to give the Speaker the pleasure of observing their effect on the hearer, and the hearer the chance to react and answer in his own way. This is, of course, only one of the many ways Milton's God allows the Son, the man, and the rebel angels to exercise their free will. God is pleased to wait for the Son's reaction, even though He already knows what it will be. That reaction, of course, involves the Son's grad ual realization that the result of the Fall must be the Incarnation. First, the Omniscient Father fore sees that man will fall; but, being "deceiv'd / By th'other first," he will find Grace. At this point God stops; neither we nor the heavenly audience yet knows how man will find it, or even whether he will be able to accept it if offered. Knowing this, the Son speaks (and it is he who asks rhetorical questions): "For should Man finally be lost?" (1. 150). But of course he knows that man will not be lost; God has just finished saying so. All four of the Son's rhetorical questions in his first reply to the "ingrate" speech were implicitly answered in the Father's already stated assurance that "Man therefore shall find Grace" (1. 132). The implied answers to the Son's four rhetorical questions (man should not finally be lost, should not fall circumvented by fraud; the Ad versary should not thus obtain his ends, God will not unmake what for His glory He has made) add no new information; for he has in fact none to give, and can only seize upon, elaborate, and examine for its implications, the Father's "gracious" pronouncement, asking, in effect, "If man will not be lost, what will happen, and how?" The father is of course pleased to be taken up thus: All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are, all As my eternal purpose hath decreed: Man shall not quite be lost, but saved who will, Yet not of will in him, but grace in me Freely voutsaf't . . . (11. 171-175) But this still does not answer the Son's implied ques tion. The Father, in fact, delays the announcement of an Incarnation, while he performs His own thirty line variation on the theme of Grace (11. 174-203). That is to say, God is preparing His Son for a stu pendously important question, and carefully de fining the "Grace" that the Son (little does he know) will himself bring to man. Finally, after the full discussion of Grace, the Father says, "yet all is not done" (1. 204). Man will receive Grace, but there must be a means—or else 55</page><page sequence="5">Die hee or Justice must; unless for him Some other able, and as willing, pay The rigid satisfaction, death for death. (11. 210-212) Only then, after long and careful, and (to the Father) thoroughly enjoyable preparation, comes that all important question (the necessary first step toward Paradise regained, mercifully allowed even before it is lost): Which of ye will be mortal to redeem Man's mortal crime, and just th'unjust to save, Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear? (11. 214-216) University of California, Los Angeles Thy creature late so lov'd, thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though join'd With his own folly? that be from thee far, That far be from thee, Father, who art Judge Of all things made, and judgest only right.

Thus might any parent, boiling with anger against a disobedient son and hastening to attack him, address in such words any one who might intercede or wish to stand in his way: 'Do not hold me back from beating a shameless and inflexible good-for-nothing; allow me to deal with him as he has earned and at the same time to in dulge my anger.' Nevertheless to these same people he might rather give a nod of approval on the other hand, for it is certainly not unwelcome to him if he be restrained; but he does not want to be thought by his son to have acted too little like a parent in this serious matter.
