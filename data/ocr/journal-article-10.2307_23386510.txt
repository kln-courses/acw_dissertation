Both excavations revealed stratigraphical sequences dated to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B, Pottery Neolithic and Early Chalcolithic periods. Significant is the discovery of the Pottery Neolithic occupations attributed to the Yarmukian culture which were unknown in this region prior to the excavations. The major characteristics of the material culture are presented, emphasizing on the cultural developments at both sites. Furthermore the settlement patterns during these periods in the region, complemented with information from surveys and old researches are discussed. 81</page><page sequence="2">82 NIMROD GETZOV et al. INTRODUCTION Late prehistoric1 occupations at north Israel are mostly known from the major alluvial valleys of the Hula Basin, the Central Jordan Valley and the Jezreel Valley (Banning 1998; Garfinkel 1992a; Gopher and Gophna 1993). The Akko Plain which is an alluvial valley in the western part of the country (Orni and Efrat 1971:51-52) yielded until recently sporadic finds suggesting it was likely inhabited during these periods. Such were reported by Prausnitz following his investigations at Kabri (Prausnitz 1959; Kempinski 2002). The 1958 excavation revealed three layers dated on the basis of material culture to the Pottery Neolithic (Layers 2-3) and Early Chalcolithic (Layer 1) periods (ibid). This observation was reaffirmed by the lithic study of the 1975 excavation season (Marder et al. 2002). Other early Chalcolithic remains were also reported by Prausnitz (1981) at the site of Horvat Akhziv Harbour. In 1991 a large scale salvage excavation was conducted by one of the authors at Horvat Uza behalf of the IAA (Getzov 2008a; Getzov et al. in press). This revealed 21 layers of which the lowermost were dated to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (Stratum 21), Pottery Neolithic (Stratum 20), Early Chalcolithic (Strata 16-19) and Late Chalcolithic (Stratum 15) periods. The nature of the settlement during these periods is unclear as the excavation of these layers was limited to a small probe. An ongoing regional survey in the Achziv-Hanita regions (Frankel and Getzov 1997) revealed several more late prehistoric occurrences which serves as the major data source for reconstructing the settlement pattern in the discussion. Pre-Pottery Neolithic B and Pottery Neolithic occupations were revealed in the neighboring adjacent region of the upper Galilee, during the 1980's at Horvat Galil and Nahal Bezet I (Gopher 1989a; 1997). 1 Late prehistoric periods in this paper refer to the time span from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B to the end of the Chalcolithic periods. The sub-division of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B follows the four sub-stages initially proposed by Cauvin (1987) for the northern Levant and adopted for the southern Levant (e.g. Bar-Yosef 2001; Goring-Morris and Belfer-Cohen 1997). The final stage, FPPNB, which is represented at the Akko Plain is contemporary with the PPNC (Rollefson 1990) recently redefined as the "Ghazalian culture" (Khalaily 2006). The Pottery Neolithic period refer the Yarmukian and the Lodian (Jericho IX) cultures (Garfinkel 1993; Gopher and Blockman 2004). Early Chalcolithic consist the Wadi Rabah culture (Kaplan 1972) and "the following variants" (Gopher and Gophna 1993), and includes what Garfinkel (1999) refers as Middle Chalcolithic. It should be noted that two of us (O.M. and I.M.) consider the Wadi Rabah as Late Neolithic following Gopher and Gophna (1993). We reserve here the term Late Chalcolithic to the Ghassulian Beersheva-Golanian cultures (and see Gilead, in press).</page><page sequence="3">83 NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA Ard el Samra Nahal Betzet I Peqi'in Hagoshrim Tel Turmus/ Tel Teo Beisamoun Sha'ar Hagolan Munhata^ Beth Shean^^ Tel Tzaf 10 20 km .

ENVIRONMENTAL SETTING The Akko Plain is located along the Mediterranean Coast in north Israel (Fig. 1). It extends for ca. 32 km long, with a breadth of 8-14 km from the "Tyrian Ladder" in the north to the Carmel promontory in the south (Orni and Efrat 1971). This region has favorable conditions for supporting agriculture as it is characterized with perennial streams (e.g. Nahal Keziv), strong springs (e.g. Kabri, Afeq), and groundwater sources (ibid). The streams draining westwards to the Mediterranean Sea create relatively "close ecosystems'5 within fertile alluvial lands which apparently were attractive for establishing Late Prehistoric settlements. A reconstruction of the Haifa Bay shoreline shows significant fluctuations in the sea levels in the region during the late prehistoric periods (Zviely et al. 2006). During the Early Holocene (Late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B - Pottery Neolithic periods) the coast in this region was wider than present and sea shores were located 4-6 km westwards (ibid: 856, fig. 5a d). By the Middle Holocene (Chalcolithic period) it was narrower following a raise in sea level placing the Haifa bay shores at ca. 2 km eastwards (idem, fig. 5f). These fluctuations must have affected the exploitation of the ecological niches in the Akko Plain by the late prehistoric populations. The aims of this paper are two fold; (1) present two recent excavation reports late prehistoric sites of Nahal Betzet II and Ard el Samra, (2) discuss the settlement patterns for the examined periods in light of the data obtained from these excavations and the Achziv Hanita regional survey within the Akko Plain. NAHALNAHAL BETZET II (O.M.) Nahal Betzet II is located on a small hill, on the southern bank of Nahal Betzet, ca. 300 m south of Shelomi (Fig. 2). The site is estimated to extend over an area of ca. 1.5 hectares, limited to the hill and the adjacent ravine to the north, ca. 42 m asl (Frankel et al. 2001:18). Geomorphologically, the Nahal Betzet ravine is composed of a dark grey alluvium Vertisol overlying an Eocene formation (Picard and Golani 1992). This Vertisol is composed of at least two depositional phases, one before the occupation of the site, and the second after it was abandoned. The site of Nahal Betzet II was discovered during the regional survey directed by Frankel and Getzov (1997: Site 80.2; Frankel et al. 2001: Site 88). In fall 2003, three weeks of excavations were conducted at the site by one of the authors (O.M.). Five areas labeled A to E were excavated and in addition 19 mechanical trenches were dug in order to estimate its extension and assist in clarifying its stratigraphie sequence. In areas A, B, C and E, 2 x 4 m squares were opened while a deep sounding of 1 x 2 m was conducted at the center of the site (Area D) (Fig. 2). All areas were subjected to random sieving except for Area D where all sediments were sieved.</page><page sequence="5">85 NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA Excavated Areas Trenches Concentrated Remains N Fragmentary Remains o | 250 m. Figure 2: Nahal Betzet II. Plan of the excavation areas and mechanical trenches. Stratigraphy The stratigraphie sequence is based on the profile (ca 1.8 m) of the deep sounding in Area D (Fig. 3).

The lowermost Layer 3 in Area D is minimum 0.80 m thick of yellow to light grey sediment; the excavations did not reach bedrock or sterile soil. It comprises a thin horizon made of small angular stones (cobbles and pebbles at the base), possibly repressing an anthropogenic surface. Feasible remains of walls made of flat medium-size (0.25 X 0.30 m) undressed stones were noted at 0.20-0.40 m above the surface. This was sealed by another thin cobble surface found some 0.10-0.15 m above it (Fig. 3). Flint artifacts and animal bones were evident in the entire layer while few pottery sherds, probably originating from Layer 2, were found only above the upper cobble surface. Few diagnostic flint tools (see below) suggest this occupation dates to the FPPNB. The overlying Layer 2 is characterized by a thick horizon 0.60-0.70 m of light grey soil with high density of burnt angular stones. This layer is rich with PN (Yarmukian) lithics and</page><page sequence="7">NAHAL BETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA 87 animal bones which were abundant throughout it. Layer 2 was further divided on the basis of diagnostic pottery; the lower part labeled 2b (ca. 0.40 m) included few PN sherds; while the upper labeled 2a (ca. 0.20 m) contained Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah). The top Layer 1 is 0.20-0.30 m thick plowed dark grey loose sediment containing angular stones and sporadic finds. The other excavated areas consisted a thin archaeological horizon with sporadic features, such as pits and hearths (mainly within the trenches), which were dug into the lower phase of the Vertisol. The artifacts from this horizon include flint tools, few groundstone tools, poorly preserved ceramics and animal bones, mostly dated to the PN period. Thus, we assume Areas A, B and C correspond to the PN occupational phase at Area D (Layer 2a) while Area E which consisted few diagnostic lithic artifact and as lacking pottery to the PPNB (Layer 3). Installations and architectural features In Area A, a shallow hearth (LI02) delimited by two fieldstones was revealed ca. 0.20 m under the top soil. Several charcoal pieces and burnt clay were preserved in its center. A single 14C date retrieved from a large piece of charcoal dated it to Medieval Ages ( 1,240 ± 100 cal. BC).2 Consequently this hearth should be considered intrusive within the PN layer. Still, all of the finds (lithic and small pottery sherds) within the vicinity of it were dated with no doubt to the PN period (see below). A small rounded feature (L111; 2.0-2.4 m in diameter) built of undressed globular hard limestones (0.20-0.60 m) was revealed in Area B (Fig. 4). Although the overall plan is not clear it appears the entrance to it was apparently from the north. The presence of a large grinding stone suggests that domestic activities were made in it. Wall remains, pits and other features were also recognized in most of the mechanical trenches. The lithic assemblage (O.M. and O.B.) The lithic assemblage of Nahal Betzet II corresponds to three periods: PPNB, PN (Yarmukian) and Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah). The assemblage is presented according to periods except for the survey collection that will be referred to in the discussion (Table 1). The main sources of flint are local Eocene nodules and small cobbles that are found at the Nahal Betzet drainage system. 2 The sample TO-11707 was dated in the laboratory of Toronto University by the courtesy of Edward Banning.</page><page sequence="8">NIMRODGETZOV et al. Figure 4: Nahal Betzet II. Area B. Rounded feature LI 11. The The The Pre-Pottery Neolithic (Layer 3) The PPNB assemblage is small and comprises 474 artifacts (Table 1). The debitage is dominated by flakes and blades. The presence of primary elements, core trimming elements and debris (ca. 50% of the whole assemblage) indicate that most of knapping occurred on-site. Technologically, the assemblage embraces flake and blade industries. The later 'bidirectional blade', characteristic to the PPNB, is represented by diagnostic debitage such as crested blades and targeted blades (Fig. 5:1-2). Only three cores were retrieved including a flakelet core, a fragment and a tested nodule (Table 2). The tool assemblage consist 38 items of which the majority (ca. 65%) was made on bidirectional blade blanks (Table 4). The projectile points, comprising ca. 10% of the tools (Fig. 5:3-5), consist two Byblos one Amuq and a fragment. The Byblos points were fashioned by invasive bifacial pressure-flaking (Fig. 5:3-4) that is typical to the final stages of the PPNB (e.g. Bocquentin et al. in press; Dag 2008; 123; Galili et al. 1993: fig. 12:8; Rollefson, Simmons and Kafafi 1992:459). The most frequent tool types are the retouched blades followed by burins and sickle blades (Fig. 5:6-9) (Table 3).The sickle blades display characteristics typical to the FPPNB as their glossed edges are nibbled by dorsal fine/semi</page><page sequence="9">NAHAL BETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA 89 abrupt retouch (Fig. 5:6-7); some bear ventral retouch and are distally truncated. The remainders of tools are ad hoc types including retouched flakes, scrapers, notches and varia. Table 1. Nahal Betzet II.

The debitage is dominated by flakes while blades play a lesser role than in the PPNB assemblage. The assemblage display three technologies: the first for the production of ad hoc flakes, the second for unidirectional blades and the third for bladelets</page><page sequence="12">92 NIMROD GETZOV et al. production. It seems that knapping occurred on-site based on the presence of primary elements, CTE and debris (ca. 45% of the whole assemblage). The cores consist of 145 items of which most are exhausted. Flake and flakelet cores are the dominant types comprising together almost 50% (Table 2). The remainders are bladelet cores, core fragments, an exhausted blade core (Fig. 6:1) and tested nodules. There are 374 tools of which most were modified on flakes (Tables 3-4). These include retouched pieces, retouched blades (e.g. Fig. 6:2), scrapers, notches, denticulates, burins, perforators and varia. The formal tools include sickle blades, bifaces, projectile points and knives. Most of the sickle blades were made on unipolar blade blanks. The sickles are deep denticulated typical to the Yarmukian culture (Stekelis 1966) (e.g. Fig. 6: 3-6). The varieties of the sickles include regular bifacial deep denticulations (e.g. Fig. 6:3-4; 6) and shallow denticulations made by pressure-flaking (e.g. Fig. 6:5). The variety is also expressed in their configuration, consisting of backed, truncated, or backed and truncated sub-types. The projectile points comprise four items of which one is possibly an Amuq point fashioned by collateral pressure-flaking. The reminders are two unidentifiable fragments and an atypical transversal point (Fig. 6:8). It is likely that the later was intruded from Layer 2a as this point is often noted in Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) assemblages (Barkai and Gopher 1999: fig. 10:1; Dag and Garfinkel 2007: fig.4; Getzov et al. in press). Another diagnostic tool is the pressure-flaked knive made on thin tabular slabs or flakes (e.g. Fig. 6:8-9; Matskevich 2005: pi. 20). The bifaces (Fig. 7:1-3) which are relatively abundant comprise elliptical chisels which are one of the characteristics of the PN period (Barkai 2005: fig. 42:1,43:1-2; Khalaily 2006: 279, 312). In addition there are axes and unidentified fragments of bifaces. Notably three of the bifaces are polished and one was transformed into a hammerstone. The The Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) (Layer 2a) The Early Chalcolithic assemblage is small and comprises 357 items. Like the PN, it is dominated by flake technology as evident by the debitage and core frequencies (Tables 1-2). Unipolar blade technology, focused on backed blades and sickle blades, seems to be more frequent than the PN (Tables 3-4). However, this notion is probably biased by the small sample which was obtained from the limited horizon in Area D. There are only seven cores in this layer consisting of three flakelet cores, one unipolar pyramidal blade core and three fragments (Table 2). Retouched and sickle blades are the dominant tools. Most of the retouched blades are fragments, while the sickles include both Wadi Rabah and Yarmukian types (Fig. 8). The denticulated Yarmukian sickles are likely introduced from Layer 3.</page><page sequence="13">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA 93 Figure 6: Nahal Betzet II.

Almost half of the stone tools were found out of their archeological contexts in the top soil or trenches. The tools found in clear contexts are attributed to the PPNB and PN (Yarmukian?), mainly in Areas A and D. No tools were found associated with the Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) layer. We will utilize here, as well as for the Ard el Samra assemblage, the classification proposed by Wright (1992) with some modifications. Table 5. Nahal Betzet II.

Most of these stone tools could be dated to the PPNB, the PN or the Early Chalcolithic. The perforated item made of limestone and an axe found in the survey (Frankel and Getzov 1997: 119, fig. 80.2.1) are typical to the Early (Wadi Rabah) and Late Chalcolithic (Ghassulian) periods (cf.

Pre-PotteryPre-Pottery Neolithic (Layer 3) Layer 3 includes two pebbles (one polished) and a grooved item, known generally as a point sharpener or a shaft straightener (Fig. 9:4). This particular sharpener, made of basalt, has two grooves, one on each face. Sharpeners or straighteners are known from several sites in the Levant and Anatolia (e.g. Davis 1982:110-111; Gopher and Orrelle 1995:73; Wright 1992: no. 100). Pottery Pottery Neolithic (Layer 2 b) Seven stone tool and vessel items were found within the PN occupation (Table 5). These include a grinding quern, handstones, a core tool, a pestle and bowl fragments. The grinding quern was found within the rounded feature (LI 11) in Area B (Fig. 4). It is made of limestone and has a shallow concave use surface and probably a round base; is the only grinding device found within this layer. The handstones include two items which were found in Areas B and C. One of them is relatively flat and made of limestone, whiles the other display a trapezoid shape and made of what appears to be sandstone. One core tool (Fig. 10: 1), with no clear use marks, is made from a limestone nodule. It has an oblong shape which makes it suitable for holding. The basalt pestle, with battered and polished use surface, was found in Area A (Fig. 10:2). Two rim bowls were found in Area A. The first (Fig. 10:3) is a shallow bowl or platter made of limestone with a flared rim classified as Type 1A by Rowan (1998:124-125). These forms are characteristic to the PN period. The second (Fig. 10:4) is made of basalt and is chronologically problematic since it represents a tapered rim of a bowl with flaring walls ("V-shaped bowls), labeled as Class 3 by Rowan (1998), and dated in general to the Late Chalcolithic (Ghassulian) period. The pottery assemblage (N.G.) Pottery sherds from Nahal Betzet II were already collected during the Israel survey by Frankel and Getzov (1997: 118-122, site 80.2). These were dated to PN and ECh periods. Among them, some exemplars were published by Sadeh (1994: fig. IV. 10). The pottery assemblage from the excavation consists of few sherds from all areas. Most of them are dated to the Roman and Byzantine periods which intruded to the PN layer. The only area which contained early component is Area D, where the finds are characteristic to the PN and Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) periods. Pottery Pottery Neolithic (Layer 2b) The pottery was hand-made sherds using a rough fabric. The diagnostic sherds include few bowl rims (Fig.l 1:1-3). There is almost not treatment on the surface of the vessels which</page><page sequence="19">NAHAL BETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA 99 Figure 10: Nahal Bctzct II. Groundstone tools. 1. Core tool. 2. Pestle. 3-4. Bowls.</page><page sequence="20">100 NIMROD GETZOV et al. is characteristic of the PN cultures (e.g. Garfinkel 1999: figs. 7, 47). However there are no sufficient elements in the pottery assemblage which could assist in defining the ascription of the pottery to one of the known repertoires of the period; they could belong either to the Yarmukian or to the Lodian (Jericho IX) (Garfinkel 1999: 16, 103; Gopher and Blockman 2004). Early Early Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) (Layer 2a) Although the ceramic finds from this layer are fewer than those from Layer 2b they were clearly ascribed to the Early Chalcolithic on the basis of types and decorations. The surface treatment of the vessels is also hand-made but it looks that the potters invested time and meticulousness on the vessels; some of them exhibit a red and black slip with burnish on it as the shallow incurving bowl (Fig. 1:4). These bowls are characteristic to the beginning of the Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) and show similarities with those of Stratum III at Teleilot Batashi (Kaplan 1958a:2). Furthermore, a carinated vessel, externally and internally (Fig. 11:5), was found in this layer. The external decoration with wavy lines was probably made with a four teeth comb. The interior of the vessel shows an incised net pattern. Exterior decorations (Kaplan 1958b: fig. 6:8-9, 12, 14), as well as interior (ibid: fig. 6:5; Garfinkel 1999: figs. 90: 2, 6) are characteristic of the Wadi Rabah culture. The shape of this particular vessel is analogous to the well-known holemouth jar from Ein el Jarba (Kaplan 1969: fig. 7:1). Similar carinated vessels with no decorations were found also at Tel Abu Zureiq (Garfinkel and Matskevich 2002:2002: fig.l 1:1-2). A broken ribbon type handle was found in this layer (Fig. 11:6); it exhibits a combed non regular decoration, similar to some sherds at Tel Abu Zureiq (Garfinkel 1999: photo 72: 2). The section, however, is not a typical one of Wadi Rabah, and differs from the handles published by Sadeh (1994: fig. IV.10:6-7). Two decorated sherds with punctuated incisions were found; one in the top soil (Frankel and Getzov 1997: 122, fig. 80.2.5:20) and another within Layer 2a (Fig. 11:7). These decorations are also characteristic of the Wadi Rabah culture (Garfinkel 1999: fig. 90:15; Kaplan 1958b: fig. 6:3). Finally a pottery whorl (Fig. 11:8), probably a spindle whorl, was found within this layer. Similar whorls were found at Nahal Zehora II and Munhata at the Wadi Rabah (Garfinkel 1992b: fig. 141:9-17; Orrelle 1993: fig. 37, type 3) and Yarmukian (idem, fig.85:7-13) stages. In sum Layer 2a should be considered as normative Wadi Rabah (Gopher and Gophna 1993) parallel to Stratum 12 at Kabri Area B (Sheftelowitz 2002), and Stratum 19 at Horvat Uza (Getzov et al. in press).</page><page sequence="21">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA 101 0 1 2 cm 1 i i Figure 11: Nahal Betzet II.

The faunal assemblages of Nahal Betzet II and Ard el Samra were analyzed using the same research protocol. Although taphonomic, mensural and demographic databases were collected for both only key aspects of diachronic and spatial changes in taxonomic frequencies will be discussed here. The bones from both excavations were recovered using dry sieving through a 5-mm mesh. Bone identification used the comparative collections of the Laboratory of Archaeozoology at the University of Haifa. All specimens identifiable to skeleton element and body-size group were recorded; however, the results presented here focus on bones identified to biological taxa only. Both taxonomic abundances and skeleton element abundance profiles were constructed using NISP (number of identified specimens) due to sample size limitations which prohibited meaningful use of minimum number of elements (MNE) or individuals (MNI). Complete specimens were measured (von den Driesch 1976). An attempt was made to discriminate sheep (Ovis aries) from goat (Capra hircus) bones using morphological criteria (Boessneck 1969). Statistical analyses were carried out using StatSoft STATISTICA™ 6 software. The Nahal Betzet II faunal assemblage (NISP = 88) is comprised mainly of caprines {Capra{Capra hircus and Ovis aries, NISP = 40), cattle (Bos sp., NISP = 27) and suid (Sus scrofa, NISP =18) remains from PN and ECh contexts (Fig. 12). A single Capra bone is the only identifiable specimen from PPNB contexts. Bones of deer, carnivores, lagomorphs and tortoises are completely absent in the assemblage, perhaps due to the small overall sample size. Five bird bones were found in PN contexts. The transition from the PN to the ECh is accompanied by a statistically significant (log likelihood ratio, G = 6.71,P = 0.03) change in the frequency of taxa. The relative frequency of cattle decreases and that of suids increases. The proportion of caprines remains unchanged. Shells (I.K.) The shell assemblage consists of Mediterranean and local landsnail (n=9) species. Five of the shells were found within the PPNB layer: four land snails (three Helix engadensis and one complete Sphincterochila cariosa) and one of Mediterranean origin (one complete CerastodermaCerastoderma glaucum). The PN layer consist seven sea shells all of them from the Mediterranean; two small GlycymerisGlycymeris insubrica (one complete and one broken), one fragment of Acanthocardia tuberculatatuberculata and one complete Columbella rustica. All of them were found without holes. The rest, two Cerastoderma glaucum (one complete and one broken) and one Conus mediterraneusmediterraneus had holes. The complete Cerastoderma glaucum had a natural hole, but the broken one and the Conus mediterraneus, had artificial hole by rubbing technique. These bearing hole shells could have been used as pendants or beads.</page><page sequence="23">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA 1Q3 shesp/gost gcat □ YarmiA ran. MISP= 58 nWadi Rata.

Summary of Nahal Betzet II The excavation at Nahal Betzet II revealed three occupational horizons dated to the PPNB, PN and ECh. Although the site is extended on a relatively large area, the superposition of the different layers is located only in a restricted Area (D). The PPNB settlement was revealed in a limited area, therefore it is difficult to draw any comprehensive conclusions. Still it appears that it should be attributed to the latest stages of the PPNB (LPPNB and/or FPPNB). This assumption is based mainly on the few Byblos points which were made by pressure-flaking. Still Nahal Betzet II could also consist Early/ Middle PPNB occupations as indicated by some diagnostic flint tools, including a Helwan point made on a purple flint blade, recovered at the regional survey by Frankel and Getzov (1997: 121, fig. 4.80.2:3). The PN is the main occupation horizon (Layer 2b) recovered at the site as it is represented at all areas and consisted architectural features, several pits and hearths. The pottery at Nahal Betzet II is not diagnostic enough to ascribe the PN occupation at Nahal Betzet II to the any of the known cultures (Yarmukian; Lodian); however the flint assemblage of consist sickle blades fashioned by deep denticulation and small elliptical chisels (Barkai 2005: fig. 42:1, 43:1-2; Khalaily 2006: 279, 312) characteristic to Yarmukian chipped stone assemblages. Notably, no distinctive sickle blades made on flakes by pressure-flaking characteristic of the Lodian assemblages were recognized (Khalaily 1999; Gopher and Blockman 2004). In spite of the fact that the flint assemblage in this layer shows elements of the Yarmukian repertoires, we feel that is not enough to define Layer 2b as Yarmukian since no diagnostic pottery is present.</page><page sequence="24">104 NIMROD GETZOV et al. The ECh (Wadi Rabah) occupation (Layer 2a) is very vague, although the majority of the pottery sherds recovered in the survey suggests it was not minor (Frankel and Getzov 1997: fig. 2.80.5). Therefore we assume this occupation was damaged by modern activities. The pottery and flint assemblages retrieved from the excavation are small and very homogeneous. Most of the pottery types are bowls and exhibit the characteristic decoration of this normative Wadi Rabah culture. A spindle whorl could point out to weaving activities in the site. As for the groundstone tools, few conclusions could be made since the assemblage is small and half of the tools were found out of context. Most of the groundstones were locally made except for the basalt component which was imported. Most of the items came from the PN layer and indicate on pounding activities while the grinding artifacts are less represented. The composition of the fauna assemblages indicates differences between the PN to the ECh occupations. In the ECh the cattle frequencies decreased, the suids increased, while the proportions of caprines remained unchanged. These changes could reflect alteration in economy at the site trough time or environmental changes in the region; these matters will be discussed below. ARD EL SAMRA (O.B. and N.G.) Ard el Samra is located below the modern fields of Kibbutz Yas'ur on the eastern edge of the Akko Plain ca. 10 km east to Akko (Fig. 13). The site is encountered in the alluvial plain north to Nahal Hilazon (ca. 100 m from the ravine) and the south-western slopes of Givat Ya'vor, at ca. 60 to 20 m asl. The site was discovered in 1990's by I. Shaked behalf of the IAA during construction works. In 2003 a salvage excavation was conducted by Y. Solomon behalf of Haifa University due to a plan to expand Route 70. This excavation was conducted in two areas (A and B) ca. 100 m apart (Fig. 13). The excavator recognized PN (Yarmukian), ECh (Wadi Rabah?) and Early Bronze Age occurrences in the northern area (A), and ECh (Wadi Rabah?) and Intermediate Bronze Age in the southern (B) (Y. Solomon, pers. comm.). In summer 2005, another area (C) was excavated by one of the authors (O.B.) on behalf of IAA due to damage - caused by mechanical works. Area C is located ca. 400 m north of Area A. One square of 5 x 5 m was opened in order to examine the stratigraphy of the site adjacent to the damaged area. The area of the excavation narrowed as it went deeper, ultimately reaching to 2.5 x 1 m above the bedrock. Two additional areas (D and E) were excavated by A. Nativ behalf of Tel Aviv University in 2007, ca. 100 m east of Area A. The excavation at this part of the site revealed Early Bronze and Intermediate Bronze Age occupations. In both areas, no Neolithic or Chalcolithic occupations were identified except for few surface finds. Post excavation damage caused by bulldozers revealed also in situ Neolithic occupations between Areas A and E.</page><page sequence="25">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA 1Q5 gmn^ -- V' Akko Plain ,20" N °0 \ ^ , Figure 13: Ard el Samra. Plan of the excavation areas. A sixth area (F) was excavated during fall 2008 by one of the authors (N.G.) behalf of IAA. Area F is located ca. 125 m south-east to Area C. Two squares of 5 x 5 m were opened focusing on the Yarmukian occupation at the site. This section in the paper reports the Area - C and F excavations, in which staratigraphically defined archaeological layers dated to the PPNB, PN and Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) periods were recognized. All sediments in both excavations were dry sieved in 5 mm mesh. Stratigraphy The stratigraphy in Area C is composed of four archaeological layers (Fig. 14). The lowermost Layer 4 is ca. 2 m thick that were excavated in a limited area of 1 x 2.5 m. The sediment is redddish-brown clayish soil with few angular stones and small patches of fine gravel horizons (2-5 cm). No architecture was reckoned although few stones and mud brick remains identified in north-west section could represent remains of a wall. Lithic finds, animal bones, sea shells and bone tools were found within this layer. Layer 3 is composed of light grey sediment with highly dense of angular stone fragments. This stony layer, ca. 0.80 m thick, was excavated in 2.5 x 2.5 m. In the upper part of the layer there were remains of what appears to have been a two-coursed wall made of unworked field stones (0.30 x 0.30 m).

The lithic are relatively scarce and non diagnostic but the pottery sherds found within this level are attributed to the Wadi Rabah culture. The uppermost Layer 1, 0.70 m thick, is mixed due to modern plowing activity excavated in a 5 x 5 m square. The finds in this level were mixed and derive from all of the mentioned periods. Area F includes four layers (Fig. 15). The lowermost, Layer 4, is sterile dark brown Vertisol. Layer 3 is evident only in two adjacent shallow pits that were dug into Layer 4 Fig. 16). The contents of the pits include flint tools, groundstone tool fragments, animal bones and an isolated human tooth, aged 17-30 (Y. Nagar, pers. comm.). All are embedded in light brown sediment. Notably no pottery was evident in this layer. Layer 2 is a stony layer (LI01 ; LI02) that varies in thickness 0.30-0.70 m (Fig. 17) within this layer several pits were recognized. Two pits (L107; L108) located at the southern part of the area were dug directly - into Layer 4, while the remainder (LI 06) - small pit included many pottery sherds was dug into the stony surface.

Although found in small quantities, some tools were made on bidirectional blades. Seven cores were found, including an exhausted bidirectional blade core, one bladelet core, two flake cores (one radial and one core on flake), two fragments and one tested nodule (Table 7). All were extremely utilized. It is most likely that the only complete wide bidirectional blade core (Fig. 18:1), found in the dump piles of Area C (counted within the top soil layer) originated from the PPNB layer, although such cores occur also in the PN period (Barzilai and Garfinkel 2006). The tool assemblage comprises only 50 items (Table 6). The majority of the tools were made on flakes (32%), blades (32%) and primary elements (18%). The remainders were made on bladelets (4%), chips (4%), chunks (4%), ridge blades (2%) and indeterminate items (4%) (Table 8). The most frequent tool type is the retouched flake (22%) (Table 9). Burins (16%), mostly of dihedral type, are the second most frequent. It is important to note that some were fashioned on bidirectional blades, of which one was a recycled projectile point (Fig. 18:</page><page sequence="30">1 1 o NIMROD GETZOV et al.

Retouched blade.</page><page sequence="31">NAHALBETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA HI 2). Sickle blades, notches-denticulates (e.g. Fig. 18:3) and scrapers are the third frequent type embracing 10% each. The sickles comprise three broken items made on bidirectional blades. One of these is made on high lustrous violet flint, typical to the Middle PPNB in the Mediterranean woodland region (Gopher 1989b; Gopher 1997:195; Rollefson, Quintero and Wilke 2007). Two denticulated Yarmukian sickle blades in Area C were likely intruded from Layer 3. Interestingly another sickle found at the dump pile in Area C display Late PPNB characteristics, like at Nahal Betzet II; nibbling at the glossed edge (Fig. 5: 6-7). The remainders of the tools are truncations (Fig. 18:4), bifaces (Fig. 18:5), and a microlith. Among the bifaces, a chisel/borer with a working edge made by longitudinal flaking possibly originated from the PN layer (and see below). It is worth mentioning a retouched blade (Fig. 18:6) made on purple flint with regular steep retouch on the ventral side resembling the PPNB sickle blades. Table 7. Ard el Samra.

The The The Pottery Neolithic (Area C Layer 3; Area F Layer 2) The assemblages in both areas display four technologies: ad hoc flakes, bidirectional blades, unipolar blades and bladelets. The bidirectional reflect a continuation of the PPNB tradition while the unidirectional blade and bladelet technologies are newly introduced technologies typical to Yarmukian culture (e.g. Matskevich 2005). There are 3 8 cores in this layer (Table 7). These comprise 18 flake cores, four unidirectional blade cores, three bladelet cores, six flakelet cores (radial) and seven fragments (Fig. 19:1 3). Some technological observations concerning unidirectional blade production are made following a large semi-pyramidal blade core (79 x 63 x 35 mm; Fig. 19:1). It appears that targeted blade blanks were removed from the narrow side of the unidirectional cores and their striking platform was meticulously prepared as suggested small scars. As for bladelet production, it appears that lustrous flint (red-orange) was the favored raw material at Ard el Samra. Interestingly lustrous flint (grey) was also favored for bladelet production at Sha'ar Hagolan (Khalaily 2006:258; Matskevitch 2005:24). The tools comprise 221 items (Table 6). Technologically, blades (39%) were favored for making some of the formal tools (i.e. projectile points and sickle blades; Table 9). Flakes (31%) and primary elements (9%) were used for ad hoc tools (i.e. scrapers, retouched pieces, denticulates and notches), while (bladelets (2.9%) for making some of the microliths and micro-borers. The reminders of the tools were made on chunks (3.3%), chips (1%), a ridge blade (4.3%) and indeterminate blanks (8.6%; Table 8). Rare (n=5) but with great importance are the projectile points (Fig. 20:1-4). These include mainly mainly Amuq points on blades with tangs fashioned by lateral pressure-flaking (Fig. 20:1-2) and a broken pressure-flaked Byblos point on flake (Fig. 20:3). The Amuq type is common at other Yarmukian sites such as Sha'ar Hagolan (Barzilai and Garfinkel 2006) and Munhata, Layer 2 (Gopher 1989b). In addition an extremely small Nizzanim point obtained from the dump piles of Area C likely originated from this layer as well (Fig. 20:4). The most frequent diagnostic tool type is the denticulated sickle blade (14.5%) typical to the Yarmukian culture; most of them were made on bidirectional blade blanks (Fig. 20:5-11). The sickles from Area C include double truncated and backed items with bifacially retouched notches. Backed and truncated items with no denticulation resembling Wadi Rabah sickles were also found in this layer and were likely intrusions from Layer 2 (see below). In Area F, the overall picture is similar; yet, three narrow items display denticulation on both sides (Fig. 20:10-11). In addition there are few retouch blades which with irregular denticulation. Another diagnostic tool type, are the pressure-flaked knives (Fig. 21:1-3). Two of them were recovered in Area C; a bifacial pressure-flaked knife found in the dump piles likely belongs to Layer 3 (Fig. 21:1) and a knife made on a flake fashioned by limited unifacial flaking on the dorsal face (Fig. 21:2). In Area F, three knife fragments were found; a proximal</page><page sequence="33">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA J J 3 Figure 19: Ard el Samra.

These were made on both bidirectional and unidirectional blade blanks (Fig. 21:4-9). Interestingly some of the bidirectional retouched blades display a standardized form of fine denticulation (Fig. 21:4-6). The reminder of the retouched blades were made on a ridge blade (n=l), a primary element (n=l) and undetermined fragments (n=3). The second most frequent tool types are the scrapers (11.8%; Fig. 22:3-4) mostly fashioned on flakes and primary elements except for an endscraper that was made of a bidirectional blade (Fig. 22:3). The burins are comprised dihedral, transversal (Fig. 22:2) and angled types. The microliths (n=3), made on the same lustrous orange flint as the bladelet cores, include truncated and inversely retouched bladelets (Fig. 22:7-8). In addition to the flint, two bladelets were made on obsidian, a small fragment and a unidirectional micro blade (Fig. 22:6). The remainders of the tools include retouched pieces (10.9%), perforators (8.1%), denticulates and notches (14%) (e.g. Fig. 22:5). The perforators are comprised by borers, awls and drills (e.g. Fig. 23:1); micro-borer and a bee. There are three interesting massive bifacial-borers of which two are complete and one is broken (Fig. 23:2-3). Such are common at Yarmukian (Khalaily 2006: figs. 11:2; 13:7, 11), Wadi Rabah (Khalaily, in press) and Ghassulian assemblages (e.g. Hermon 2003: pi. 39:1). The bifaces (7.2%) comprise four chisels (e.g. Fig. 24) of which one is polished (Fig. 24:2), four fragments and two axes (one is polished and the other was transformed into a hammer stone) (Fig. 24:3). The remainders are a truncation and varia. The The The Early Chalcolithic-Wadi Rabah (Area C Layer 2) The lithic assemblage of Layer 2 is comprised of 1045 items (Table 6). The ad hoc flake technology dominates this assemblage (52.9% flakes) although unidirectional blade and bladelet technologies are also evident. There are 26 cores in this layer comprised of 14 flakelet cores, 5 flake cores, 4 bladelet, 1 pyramidal unidirectional blade core and a mixed blade-flake core (Fig. 25:1-3; Table 7). The tools comprise 91 items of which the retouched blades and sickle blades are the dominant types (Table 9). The projectiles points include a transversal type (Fig. 25:4) and a fragment. The sickle blades include Wadi Rabah and Yarmukian types; that latter were likely introduced from Layer 3. The Wadi Rabah sickle blades were made on unidirectional blade blanks and bear a rectangular shape that was fashioned by abrupt retouch at one edge</page><page sequence="37">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA 117 Figure 22: Ard el Samra.

The bifaces comprise four items; one of them appears to be a fragment of a bifacial knife (e.g. Fig. 25:8). Retouched bladelets comprise seven finely retouched items; most fashioned on lustrous pink/orange flint. Another tool type fashioned on bladelets is the micro-borer (Fig. 25:9) although most of the perforators were made on blade and flake blanks. Ad hoc tools include retouched pieces, varia, truncations, denticulates, notches and burins. Table 9. Ard el Samra.

E-R. and I.M.) The groundstone tool assemblage from Ard el Samra is presented by periods (Table 10). Area C comprises 28 items which derive from the PPNB (n=2), PN (n=ll), Early Chalcolithic (n=8) and top soil (n=7) layers. Area F comprises 38 items that originate from the PN (n=35) and the top soil (n=3) layers. Pre-PotteryPre-Pottery Neolithic B Only two objects were found in Area C; a handstone (see below) and a perforated disk. The disk is made of limestone and has flattened and smoothed surfaces with drilled hole in the center (Fig. 26:1). The surfaces of the disk display parallel incised lines forming a cross diagonal motif. It was generally accepted to regard these disks as loom weights (Kaplan</page><page sequence="42">122 NIMROD GETZOV et al. 1969:16), but loom weight appears only from the Middle Bronze Age II onwards (Shamir 1996:39). Therefore this delicate thin-sectioned item seems more appropriate to be a spinning whorl (ibid: 149). Similar disks were also noted at the nearby site of Horvat Uza (Getzov et et al. in press, fig. 60: 9-10). Table 10. Ard el Samra.

These include disks, hammerstones, rubbing stones, multiple tools, polished pebbles, mortars, pestles, chipped items and a vessel. The disks, comprise ca. 20% of the assemblage, are flat limestone items shaped by grounding and flaking techniques. In general the disks have lenticular or plano-convex cross-sections (Fig. 26:2-3) averaging 8.2 x 6.8 x 2.7 cm. Similar items (identified as choppers) were found at Munhata Layer 2B (Gopher and Orrelle 1995: fig. 36:11). Recently it was proposed that disks could have been utilized as stoppers, although other functions such as tools utilized in pottery making, scrapers, or heavy duty tasks were also considered (Rosenberg et al. 2009). Flammerstones, also called pounders (Wright 1992:70), are the second representative tool group (12.2%). These are core tools with battering marks all over the surface (e.g. Fig. 26: 4). The hammerstones at Ard el Samra are squared or rounded items made of hard limestone, quartzite and flint nodules. It is not clear if they were used for pounding in food processing</page><page sequence="43">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA 123 Figure 26: Ard el Samra. Groundstones from from Areas C and F. 1.

Four rubbing stones and four multiple tools were likely used both for rubbing and pounding activities (e.g. Fig. 26:5). Three water-worn limestone pebbles with one or more polished surfaces were found Area F. Their function at Ard el Samra is unclear; however in Predynastic Egyptian burials they were usually associated with palettes and probably were used for fine grinding (Rowan 2006). Furthermore, three fragments of limestone mortars were found; including small (e.g. Fig. 26:6-7) and large items (e.g. Fig. 27:1). The small mortar was probably used for fine or small scale pounding.</page><page sequence="44">124 NIMROD GETZOV et al. o Figure 27: Ard el Samra. Groundstones from from Areas C and F. 1. Bowl. 2.

A bifacial (Fig. 27:3) and a chipped pebble (utilized as a chopper?) (Fig. 27:4) both are made of limestone were found in Area F; they possibly represent tools in preparation. This</page><page sequence="45">NAHAL BETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA 125 notion is supported by the presence of three flakes, one made of basalt and two made of limestone, recovered in the same area thus showing knapping activities on materials other than flint. The only vessel present is one small rectangular platter fragment in Area C. Early Early Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) Eight objects were found in the Wadi Rabah context in Area C. Three handstones, three polished pebbles, one disk and a basalt bowl. The basalt bowl is an elaborated thin item with straight walls and the beginning of a ridge in the lower part. The inner surface is well polished. In spite of the fact that the fragment is small, it seems to represent a pedestaled bowl dated generally to the Late Chalcolithic (Ghassulian) (Rowan 1998: figs. 30-32). Top Top soil contexts Ten objects were found in top soil, seven from Area C and three from Area F. These latter include a disk and two polished pebbles that seem to originate from the PN layer of Area F (and see below). Three fragments of grinding slabs were found in Area C. These are relatively small portable items with one flat used surface made of basalt or hard limestone. Summary Summary Most of the ground stone tools at Ard el Samra were made on locally available raw materials except for the basalt items. It is difficult to conclude on the PPNB and Early Chalcolithic assemblages due to their small sizes. The PN assemblage which mostly derives from Area F represents a homogenous assemblage comprising three main groups of tools: disks, hammerstones and pounding tools (including pestles and multiple tools). Grinding activity tools are less represented by the few grinding stones and mortars. Two other groups merit attention: the polished pebbles that seem to be related to a special type of smoothing (pottery?) or delicate grinding, and a set of chipped limestone tools and debitage. Vessels are poorly represented; it is not clear if the basalt bowl from the Wadi Rabah context is intrusive, i.e. belong to the Ghassulian culture, or vessels like this were already present in Early Chalcolithic contexts (and see below Discussion and Conclusions). As the assemblage is still small it is difficult to extract more conclusions but it is enough to point out general trends in it. It looks like the main stone utensils within the PN at the site represent more particular types of crafts (e.g. hammerstones for flint knapping, pottery finishing by small pebbles or using perforated disks as loom weights) than tools for food processing (and see Wright 2008).</page><page sequence="46">126 NIMROD GETZOV et al. The Pottery (N. G. and A. E-R.) The Pottery of Ard el Samra is presented here according to period and types, but the figures are arranged according to areas. Chronologically, Area C includes pottery assemblages from the Yarmukian and Wadi Rabah cultures, while Area F is only represented by Yarmukian pottery (Tables 11-12).3 The balk of both assemblages corresponds in general with Layers 3 in Area C and Layer 2 in Area F for the Yarmukian and Layer 2 in Area C for the Wadi Rabah. Still, in both areas the layers contained mixed pottery.4 Table 11. Ard el Samra.

The typology presented here is based on Garfinkel (1999) and Gopher and Blockman (2004). The following description of the types is according to rims, handles, bases and decoration features. Shallow Shallow straight-walls bowls Only one exemplar was encountered in Area C (Fig. 28:1). The walls of these bowls have a straight section and the inclination of them is less than 45°. Garfinkel classifies them as type C5a (1999:32, fig. 15:2, 5, 9). It is worth noting that a similar type, C6 (Garfinkel 1999:78, fig. 48:1-6, 8-9), is also characteristic to Lodian assemblages. Same type of bowls was also found at Horvat Uza (Getzov et. al. in press, fig. 23:16). Deep Deep straight-walls bowls This is similar to the above but deeper. Between these deep bowls there is a great differentiation in depth and decoration of the vessel (Fig. 28:2-8). Furthermore, the rims</page><page sequence="48">128 NIMROD GETZOV et al. 1 \ .-.J. / J 7 1 \ 10 ' •' '-.{'..■XT'' 15 17 7 t v o 10 cm f \ I / 12 13 ' 11 j 14 16 \ I V 18 ¥ 19 Figure 28: Ard el Samra.

Holemouth jars.</page><page sequence="49">NAHAL BETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA 129 could be rounded, pointed or squared. These bowls appear both in Yarmukian and Lodian contexts, corresponding to types C2, C3 and E2 of Garfinkel (1999: figs. 14:4-7; 8; 17; 47:1, 4, 50). Some of these bowls were defined as kraters by Gopher and Blockman (2004: fig. 8: 5-14). Similar bowls were found at Horvat Uza (e.g. Getzov et al. in press, fig. 23: 11-14) Everted-rimEverted-rim bowls These are round walled bowls with everted rims (e.g. fig. 28:9-10). Bowls with similar shape and decoration typical to the Yarmukian culture were integrated into type C7 and E2 of Garfinkel (1999: figs. 18:1; 49:10). Within the Lodian assemblages, bowls with everted rims are also ubiquitous (Gopher and Blockman 2004: fig. 6:37-48). Similar bowls were retrieved at Horvat Uza (Getzov et al. in press, fig. 23:17). Chalice Chalice One chalice (Fig. 28:11) from Area F displays a hemispherical bowl and a ring base pedestal. This chalice corresponds with Garfinkel type C4 (1999:32). Straight Straight or round small bowls This type is similar to the deep bowls but smaller in diameter and with straight or round walls (e.g. Fig. 28:12-14); less than 13 cm according to Blockman (1997:12). In general similar bowls with handles were recorded in other sites, still no handles were found at Ard el Samra. Garfinkel (1999: figs. 8:4, 8; 43) classifies these bowls as type Al; similar bowls are characteristic to the Lodian assemblages as well (Gopher and Blockman 2004: fig.7:24; 32). HolemouthHolemouth jars The holemouth jars are attributed to Garfinkel (1999: fig. 31) type F1 (e.g. Fig. 28:15-19). They are common in the Yarmukian as well as the Lodian assemblages (idem, 57; Gopher and Blockman 2004: fig. 9:1-20). At Ard el Samra, the holemouths are open; this differentiates them from closer types that appear in the Lodian assemblages. These items have the characteristic flat knob handles, common in many of the holemouth jars. The holemouth jars from Horvat Uza (e.g. Getzov et al. in press, fig. 23:15) are closer, suggesting a relation with Lodian assemblages in the later site. Jars Jars All the jars bear everted necks with greater diameters in the rims than at the neck bases representing different sub-types (e.g. Fig. 29:1-5). These jars correspond with types Dl, D2, E4, F2, F3 and F4 of Garfinkel classification (1999: 43-50, 53-57, 87-93). They appear in the Yarmukian assemblages; at Lodian assemblages they are present as well, but in lesser frequencies (Gopher and Blockman 2004: 10). In the Lodian assemblages the most common are the converging-neck jars. At Horvat Uza, everted jars were found, while converging-neck jars where not found (Getzov et al., in press, fig. 23:22-23).</page><page sequence="50">130 NIMROD GETZOV et al. \ I I V Jam Y 11 12 14 10 r 13 16 i 15 0 10 1 l l cm 17 18 Figure 29: Neolithic Pottery from Ard el Samra, Area F. 1-9.

Also few exemplars of these amphoriskoi with the typical Yarmukian decoration were also found at Horvat Uza (e.g. Getzov et al. in press, fig. 23:7). These vessels were classified as type Bl-2 by Garfinkel (1999: figs. 24, 54), and they appear in Yarmukian and Lodian assemblages as well (Gopher and and Blockman 2004: figs.10:11-24; 11). PithoiPithoi The few exemplars of pithoi from at Ard el Samra could not have been classified into sub-types. The pithos illustrated here (Fig. 29:10) belong the open pithos with round rims type E4b of Garfinkel (1999: 43), classification which appears among other Yarmukian assemblages such as at Ain Ghazal (Kafafi 1990: fig. 4:1). Ledge Ledge handles Ledge handles are found in general on holemouths near the rims (e.g. Fig. 28:15-16,18-19). Loop Loop handles Only small fragments of loop handles were found (e.g. Fig. 29:11-12). It is impossible to determine to which vessel type they belong to. Knobs Knobs Likewise, the attribution of the few knobs at Ard el Samra (e.g. Fig. 29:13) and to specific vessels type could not be made. Flat Flat bases Fig. 29:14-15 represent the most common type of bases. There is a variety of ways of joining the base with the walls: high base protruding from the junction with the walls, creating an angle with them (no. 14); a simple base, aligned with the line of the walls of the vessels creating a sort of obtuse angle (no. 15); a flat rounded base (not illustrated). Ring Ring bases Several ring bases were found (e.g. Fig. 29:16) and they belong in general to chalices. Bases Bases Bases with rounded indentations Flat and rounded bases with rounded indentations on their external surface were recovered (e.g.(e.g. Fig. 29:17-18). The bases have not clear borders and the indentations cover also the lower part of the walls. Similar bases have been encountered as characteristic of the Lodian culture (Garfinkel 1999: 95; Gopher and Blockman 2004:17-18; Kaplan 1977: fig. 4:8; P1.7:17; Milevski and Baumgarten 2008), while at Yarmukian Sha'ar Hagolan they are underrepresented. Still these bases were recorded at Horvat Uza and Munhata, where both Yarmukian and Lodian</page><page sequence="52">132 NIMROD GETZOV et al assemblages are present (e.g. Garfinkel 1992b: figs. 82:10-13, 1999: 58-59; Getzov et al. in press, fig.23:24-26; Gopher 1989b: figs. 40-41; Gopher and Gophna 1993: 341). The presence of bases with rounded indentations at Ard el Samra accords with their ascription also to Yarmukian culture (Garfinkel 1999:58-59). Decoration Decoration In general, there are almost no decorations, no burnish or color coats on the vessels; part of this situation could be the result of the bad preservation of the sherds. Coating is present in few cases and only five sherds bear incisions; two of them represent the well known Yarmukian chevron motif on the shoulders of an amphoriskoi (e.g. Fig. 29:9) (Garfinkel 1999: 59-68). Summary Summary The pottery assemblages of Layer 3 in Area C and Layer 2 in Area F should be regarded as Yarmukian since they show great affinities with the known repertoire of this culture. Among these are: chevron decoration on amphoriskoi, deep bowls, holemouth jars with everted openings, and necked jars with everted rims; in addition they totally lack closed jars, as in the Lodian assemblages. Notably, the appearance of bases with rounded indentations confirms that these are also characteristic to the Yarmukian culture. The The The Wadi Rabah assemblage (Area C, Layer 2) The Wadi Rabah pottery assemblage is small and includes 44 diagnostic items (Table 11). The clay of the vessels is relatively well levigated and well fired with small gray and white grits. The type diversity is comparatively limited comprising mainly bowls and jars, among them necked jars, holemouths and pithoi (Table 11). Bowls Bowls The bowls include a simple bowl with straight profile, red slipped and burnished (Fig.30: 1-2) classified by Garfinkel type A1 (1999: fig. 67:2). Parallels are found at Nahal Betzet I (Gopher 1989a: fig. 7) and at Horvat Uza (Getzov et al. in press, fig. 27: 6). Small globular bowls with inverted profile resemble some exemplars from Horvat Uza (Getzov et al. in press, fig. 27:1-3), and a carinated bowl (Fig. 30:3) is similar to those from Nahal Betzet I (Gopher 1989a: fig. 7:3) and Horvat Uza (Getzov et al. in press, fig. 27: 4-5). Another large bowl or basin (Fig. 30:4) with thick walls and a cut rim have a parallel at Horvat Uza (Getzov et et al. in press, fig. 27: 9) and Nahal Betzet I, Gopher 1989a: fig. 7:7). In LI 03 two hollow high base probably of chalice (Fig. 30:5-6) were found (Garfinkel 1999:123-124, Type CI). These are similar to bases found at Horvat Uza Layerl7 (Getzov et al. in press. 31:20-23).</page><page sequence="53">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA 133 VT7 1 s J Y f f A o L_ 1 O cm I I I 10 11 Figure 30: Ard el Samra.

Jars Jars The only type of jars recorded at Ard el Samra is the straight neck jar (Fig. 30:7); similar jars were reported at Beisamoun (Rosenberg et al. 2006, fig. 3) and at Horvat Uza Layer 17 (Getzov et al. in press. Type ChSj.2). Undecorated holemouth jars (Fig. 30:8-9) with a cut rim and thick walls, are similar to Horvat Uza Layer 19 (Getzov et al. in press, fig 27:13-18) (Garfinkel 1999: Type E3). The holemouth pithoi with cut rim at Ard el-Samra are thicker than the walls at Horvat Uza (Getzov et al. in press, fig 30:1-3). Decoration Decoration The most common decoration is red slip that was applied to all types of vessels. Black burnishing, combined with red, was restrained to bowls. Other decorations include "combing", "incisions5', "impressions" (including lunar-shaped impressions) and plastic decorations are present (e.g. Fig. 30:10-11). Summary Summary To summarize: the Wadi Rabah pottery assemblage from Ard el Samra shows great resemblance to the pottery assemblages from neighboring sites Horvat Uza and Nahal Betzet I. The limited variety of pottery types could result to small size of the assemblage and excavation area. The Fauna (N.M.) The assemblage from Ard el Samra, Areas C and F, yielded 133 bones identified to taxon (Table 13). Cattle are most dominant (NISP = 45, 34 %) in all stratas, followed by caprines (NISP = 38, 29%), suids (NISP = 37, 28%), mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella, NISP = 9, 7%), and canids (Canis sp., NISP = 4, 3%). Other game animals are represented by single specimens: Mesopotamian fallow deer (Dama mesopotamica) and Cape hare (Lepus capensis)capensis) from Yarmukian context; red fox ( Vulpes vulpes) from Wadi Rabah context; and - notably - hippopotamus (Hippopotamos amphibious) from the PPNB context, represented by a canine. Osteological measurements (Table 14) may be used to infer the status of domestication for cattle and caprines, as reduction in body size is an often-used criterion to differentiate between domestic stocks from its wild progenitors (Clutton-Brock 1999; Meadow 1989). However the measurements cannot be corroborated by demographic data and are therefore of limited value. The Caprine astragali (n = 2) length and breadth measurements at PPNB Ard el Samra (Table 15) are smaller than of domesticated caprine astragali from Iron Age Tel Rehov, in the Beth-Shean valley (Marom et al. in press); the upper range of the Ard el Samra specimens in all three measurements falls below two standard deviations from the Tel Rehov average. With great caution, due to the small sample size, the caprines from PPNB Ard el Samra are suggested to have been domesticated.</page><page sequence="55">NAHAL BETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA !35 Tables 13.

The Ard el Samra cattle measurements from PPNB context are smaller than the standard, and the Yarmukian measurements show a further reduction in mean LSI values (Fig. 31). The demise in size may indicate cattle have been managed by the site inhabitants from the PPNB onwards. Taxonomic frequencies show marked spatial differences between the two excavation areas, and also diachronic changes within the areas, with the transition from the PPNB to the PN. The results of a log-linear analysis (Sokal and Rohlf 1995; Table 16) show that in Area C, the faunal assemblage is dominated by suids and cattle during the PPNB. It seems that caprines increased with the transition from the PPNB to the Yarmukian. In Area F the picture is different, as cattle frequencies increase while caprines disappear at the same time.</page><page sequence="58">13 8 N1MROD GETZOV et al. Table 16.

Thirty shells were retrieved from Areas C and F. Twenty seven of them originate from the Mediterranean Sea, one is a local freshwater bivalve and two are freshwater snails. The shells are presented here according to periods. Pre-PotteryPre-Pottery Neolithic B The PPNB shells include a broken Cerastoderma glaucum with an enlarged hole at the umbo, fives Glycymeris insubrica (three fragments and two complete shells with artificial holes), and two complete Acanthocardia tuberculata, shells. The latter were probably used as pendants as they were rubbed at the umbo to produce a hole. Pottery Pottery Neolithic (Yarmukian) The Mediterranean species from the PN context include Glycymeris insubrica (n=7), Glycymeris Glycymeris bimaculata (n=l), Cerastoderma glaucum (n=2), Acanthocardia tuberculata5 (n=2), Phalium undulatum (n=l), and Cymatiumparthenopeum (n=l) (Fig. 32). 5 Three autochthonous taxa are known from the eastern Mediterranean of Israel: Glycymeris bimaculata,bimaculata, Glycymeris glycymeris pilosa and Glycymeris insubrica. All are rare species in the shores of Israel. This in spite the fact that empty valves of Glycymeris insubrica form the bulk of the shells on the beach (Mienis et al 2006).</page><page sequence="60">140 NIMROD GETZOV et al.

Another is a</page><page sequence="61">NAHAL BETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA 141 AcanthocardiaAcanthocardia tuberculata with two holes; one drilled by a gastropod on the dorsal side of the shell, and the other on the umbo (Fig. 32:2). Another shell that could have been used as a pendant is a worked fragment of Phalium undulatum;undulatum; "cassid lip5' (Fig. 32:3). This shell was worked to a thin straight configuration displaying sharp edges (26.5 mm x 3.4 mm) and a thin incision around the upper part of the lip, probably for stringing. "Cassid lips" appear in graves, sanctuaries and undefined archeological contexts since the Early Kebaran It was proposed that they might have been used as ornaments tied to strings (Reese 1989). Interestingly a Cymatium parthenopeum which is rare in archaeological sites was retrieved (Fig. 32:4). In addition two freshwater shells were recorded; a complete Melanopsis buccinoidea with a natural hole, and a fragment of bivalve unio sp. Early Early Chalcolithic (Wadi Rabah) One complete shell of Cerastoderma glaucum was found from this layer. Top Top soil Two shells of Cerastoderma glaucum were found, one broken and one complete with an enlarged hole in the umbo. Two other exemplars are a water worn fragment of Phalium undulatum,undulatum, a "cassid lip", and a fragment of a freshwater snail Melanopsis buccinoidea. Discussion Discussion The shells from Ard el Samra are significantly represented in the Yarmukian layer. It consists of Mediterranean and local freshwater shells and does not show long distance connections, as can be seen for example at Hagoshrim V (Getzov 2008b).6 Differences can also be due to size of the sample excavated (775 m2 in Hagoshrim vs. 75 m2 in Ard el Samra). It is proposed that some of the shells were probably used as pendants as eleven items (36% of the assemblage and 84% of the complete bivalves) have holes. The two-holed Acanthocardia Acanthocardia tuberculata shell (Fig. 32:2) could have been also utilized as a button. The bone tools (G. L.D.) The bone tools assemblage contains eight pieces. Most of them (n=5) are flat cutting or smoothing tools. Their width is range 10-19 mm while their thickness average 3 mm. Three items with an elliptical section with very thin sides may have been used for cutting. The sides of one of them are completely smoothed by use. 6 The malacological material from Ha-Gosherim is presently studied by I.K.</page><page sequence="62">142 NIMROD GETZOV et al. Another tool, with a thicker rectangular section, is broken at the distal end. This item has a rectilinear base, parallel sides in the mesial part and converging at the break point. The remaining distal part is smoothed by use over a distance of 11mm from the broken extremity. Most of these flat tools were made on ribs of medium to large mammals that were cut longitudinally. In one case, the bone was also cut transversally by sawing. The blanks were then shaped by shaving while the bases were abraded. The interpretations of the traces left on the three remaining pieces are not univocal. Therefore we can't ascertain that they are tools. One of them is a fragment of a rib (with the whole section) with smoothed surfaces on which very fine and transversal striations appear. They could result from post depositional events, from intentional polishing of the bone or from use. The second piece is a fragment of a thin rib, burnt to black, on which traces of shaving are seen. They were left during butchery or during the production of a tool. Finally, one piece is a tooth. One extremity near the root could have been sawn but the tooth is so smoothed that it is difficult to affirm. This small assemblage from Ard el Samra contains classical Neolithic products made by the regular techniques known at this time (Le Dosseur 2009). Nonetheless, one should notice the absence of pointed tools. Whether if it is due to the small size of the sample, to a special function of the site or to special function of the area where the bone tools were found is still a matter of speculation. An incised seal and two figurines (A. E-R., N. G., I.M.) Three further finds made of clay and pottery from Ard el Samra merit a separate mention. The The seal The seal made from black serpentine (Fig. 33:1) was uncovered from the PN layer in Area C (LI06). The item, broken with ca. a half missing, is oblong in shape, 2.4 cm wide and 2.2+ cm long, with a hole drilled in the center (drill diameter 0.7-0.24 cm). The design of the seal is created by row of chevrons resembling a herring bone design. The artifact was broken, probably by unsuccessful drilling which cuts the chevron pattern. It is likely that this seal belongs to the "low back seals" (Buchanan and M00reyl984); and the secondary drilled hole probably intended to replace its broken handle. Similar seals were reported from several sites, while the design motive is rare and reported both from southern (Beck 1993: fig. 1) and the northern Levant (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: fig. 191:6). Primarily designated to be an impressing tool, and probably used after as a personal amulet (and see Skeates 2007:196).</page><page sequence="63">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA 143 Figure 33: Ard el Samra.

"Conirostre"Conirostre "figurine An upper fragment of a figurine (Fig. 33:2) was unearthed in a PN context of Area C (L105). The item is 3.9 cm high and 1.1 cm in diameter. The body is cylindrical, smoothed and uniform in diameter. The clay is well levigated and tempered with very fine gray-black grits and straw. The head is modeled at the top end by pinching the clay to the back of the figurine. This created a triangular head with a pointed nose, resembling birds' beak. The lower part of the figurine is broken. It can be assumed that as for example in Munhata (Garfinkel 1995: fig. 31:3) the figurine can be interpreted as a cylindrical simple standing figurine with a head on the top. Similar figurines were reported from different Neolithic sites, e.g. Munhata and Sha'ar Hagolan (Garfinkel 1995:38-40; 2004:190). Similar figurines were reported from PPNB and PN contexts.7 These are probably anthropomorphic figurines but they could be also a depiction of animals. Commenge-Pellerin (1998) defined these types of figurines as conirostre, i.e. a conus-shaped face, proposing to see in it an anthropomorphic item and Garfinkel (ibid) included these in his group of pillar figurines. In contrast, Rollefson (1991) saw in a comparable figurine from Ain Ghazal, a bird. 7 See for instance Commenge-Pellerin 1998 with bibliography. Several figurines of this type were found recently at Kfar Hahoresh (N. Goring-Morris pers. comm.) and Yiftahel (N.G. and I.M. pers. observation).</page><page sequence="64">144 NIMROD GETZOV et al. YarmukianYarmukian figurine A figurine made of a pottery sherd with the image of a woman was found in Area F (LI02) (Fig. 34). The sherd is 7.5 cm height, 5.6 cm wide and 1.4 thick; the fabric color is yellowish red and includes medium grey and white grits. Figure 34: Ard el Samra.

Sides.</page><page sequence="65">NAHAL BETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA 145 The sherd was cautiously worked and its edges were polished. The shape of the sherd is ca. an equilateral triangle; the top of it is rounded. The sherd was broken in two; besides the lower left angle was broken and missing as well. The recto of the figurine is incised on the convex side of the sherd (Fig. 34:1, 4); the verso is incised on the concave side (Fig. 34:2, 6). On the edges of the sherd, there are lines that connect the drawings from the recto and the verso verso (Fig. 34:3, 5) giving the impression of one complete tri-dimensional image. The recto has two inclined lines finely incised, depicting the eyes. Since the sherd is broken on the lower part of the face is impossible to see if there is a line for the mouth or dividing the head from the body. On the body the typical garment of two halve is represented, covering the chest and the shoulders. A pair of three parallel diagonal lines under the garment seems to mark the thighs. The verso of the sherd show two diagonal lines meeting in the center of the head and depicting a "V", probably symbolizing the division line between the head and the body. Above these diagonal lines, there are two almost vertical and parallel lines and a horizontal line in the middle connecting them, depicting a sort of "H". All these lines could stand for a hairstyle (cf. Yizraeli-Noy 1999:62, no.46), a hat or other sort of clothing worn by the figure on her head (and see Stekelis 1966:41; Garfinkel 2004: 160). The back of the body is incised with a pair of diagonal lines probably depicting de back of the garment, and a pair of two diagonal lines for the back of the thighs. The figurine from Ard el Samra have a great similarity with the detailed incised pebble figurines found at Sha'ar Hagolan (e.g. Stekelis 1966: PI. 54:1) and Munhata (e.g. Yizraeli Noy 1999:87, no.86). Actually it is a schematic depiction of the clay female figurines known from Sha'ar Hagolan and defined by Garfinkel (2004:149-163) as the "clay seated goddess", one of the clear markers of the Yarmukian culture. As in the pebble figurines, the Ard el Samra sherd lacks some of the elements present in the clay figurines, as ears, earrings, cheeks, breasts, arms and legs. The lack of neck could be attributed not only to the schematic way of fashioning of the figurine, but to a general concept since also in the clay figurines the head sits directly on the shoulders. Garfinkel (2004: 177) pointed out that the "schematic goddesses" represented in the detailed pebble figurines, lacking breasts and genitals, do not depict fertility symbols; although, as in the case of Ard el Samra, it must be pointed out that they represent females. Whether they correspond to a different type of cult and which kind of cult as that from the clay figurines (Yizraeli-Noy 1999: 70) is hard to say from our example.</page><page sequence="66">146 NIMROD GETZOV et al. Summary of Ard el Samra Althoug the excavtions at Ard el Samra were limited in size it is quite clear that it was a major settlement in the Akko plain during the late prehistoric periods. The site is etimated to have extended over at least 10 hectares, based on the excavation areas and survey conducted by one of the authers (N.G.) (Fig. 13). Like Nahal Betzet II, there is spatial stratigraphy, and superposition is attested in Area C which presumably was the center of the site as displayed by ca. 3.5 m' sequence of archaeological layers (Fig. 14). The PPNB layer is charaterized by a small lithic assemblage dominated by ad hoc flakes, polished bone tools and sea shells. The fauna assemblage is equaly comprised of Sus, Bos and caprovines. It is worth mentioning a canine of a hippopotamus, indicating presence of permanent water source around the area of the site. Wall remnants and mudbricks were detected suggesting presence of structures. The PN occupation at the site is well represented by relatively rich assemblages including lithic, ground-stone tools, pottery, fauna and figurines. The lithic assemblage is comprised of ad hoc flake, unidirectional blade and bladelet technologies. The formal tools are characteristic to the Yarmukian culture, i.e. denticulated sickles, pressure-flaked knives and Nizanim and Amuq points. The pottery repertoire, mainly in Area F, is strictly Yarmukian. It is comprised of several types of bowls, jars, holemouths and the well know decoration motifs of this culture. It is worth mentioning the appearance of bases with rounded indentations, not very well known in Yarmukian assemblages. The ground-stones derive mainly from Area F, comprises three main groups of tools: disks, hammerstones and pounding tools (including pestles and multiple tools). Two other groups merit attention: the polished pebbles and a set of chipped limestone tools and debitage. Stone vessels are rare. Most of the ground-stone tools at Ard el Samra were made on locally available raw materials. Within the Area C fauna assemblage caprovines become more common than Sus and Bos. Most of the bone tools were made on large mammals probably Bos sp. The balk of the shells was found in the Yarmukian layer and the majority is sea species from the Mediterranean Sea. Two figurines and a geometric seal were recovered from the PN layers. This finds point the richness of imagery items at the site. The Yarmukian figurine (Fig. 34) is unique since schematic figurines were known only on pebbles. The utilization of a pottery shaped sherd portraying the well known motifs of Yarmukian goddesses is unique in respect to other Yarmukian sites. The ECh (Wadi Rabah) occupation was recorded in Area C, and probably also in Areas A-B. Therefore we assume this occupation was smaller than the Yarmukian one. The lithic assemblage is characterized by ad hoc flake technology. Notable are the backed and truncated sickle blade with rectangular shape, typical to Wadi Rabah culture. The pottery assemblage include mainly bowls and jars of which typical Wadi Rabah decorations such as red slip, black burnish, combing, incisions and impressions are common.</page><page sequence="67">NAHAL BETZETII AND ARD EL-SAMRA 147 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS In this discussion we attempt to integrate the results of the excavations at Nahal Betzet II and Ard el Samara within the Neolithic-Chalcolithic settlement pattern in the Akko Plain and ajacent regions. The salvage excavations at Nahal Betzet II and Ard el Samra exposed two multilayer sites inhabited during the PPNB, the PN and the ECh periods. The occupation during these periods at both sites extended over different areas, still in few locales (i.e. Area D in Nahal Betzet II and Area C in Ard el Samra) they accumulated one over another. Consequently the stratigraphy at both sites is spatial rather than the classic vertical accumulation of tells. Similarily this phenomenon is evident at other late Prehistoric multi-layer key sites such as Ain Ghazal, Beisamoun and Hagoshrim (Rollefson, Simmons and Kafafi 1992; Getzov 2008a; Bocquentin et al. in press). Unfortunately, the exposure of the PPNB layers at both sites is too small for reconstructing the size of settlement, its nature and duration of occupation. Regarding the chronology, some elements within the lithic assemblages suggest both sites were probably occupied during the Final PPNB. The PN is by far the most well represented at Nahal Betzet II and Ard el Samra. While the ascription of the PN occupation at Nahal Betzet II to the Yarmukian culture was based on the flint assemblage, Ard el Samra includes most of the Yarmukian components. Not only the Yarmukian pottery is well defined at Ard el Samra, but also the incized figurine which is clearly one the fossil guides of this culture. However, some elements in the pottery such as bases with rounded indentations possibly represent a regional variant. Other finds show orientation to the north. These include the seal-amulet which have equivalents in the Amuq Valley, the "conirostre" figurine with a parallel from Ras Shamra (de Contenson 1977: fig. 12) and the two obsidian bladelets which their source/s must have been in Anatolia. The economy pattern in both sites, observed through the faunal remains, was based largely on suid, caprine, and cattle resources. Similar exploitation was reported from other assemblages in northern Israel, such as Tel Teo (Horwitz 2001), Abu Zureiq (Horwitz 2002), Munhata (Ducos 1968), Hagoshrim (Haber 2001 ; Haber and Dayan 2004), and Nahal Zehora (Davis in press). Within this basic economic arrangement, strong diachronic and intra-site differences are apparent. At Nahal Betzet II, the transition from the Yarmukian to the Wadi Rabah phase was accompanied by a sharp increase in the proportion of pigs, and a concurrent decrease in cattle; a similar process was apparent also in Nahal Zehora (Davis in press). Such pattern was suggested to indicate on the domestication of the pig by the Late Neolithic/Early Chalcolithic transition (Haber and Dayan 2004). The Yarmukian faunal composition at Ard el Samra, show differences between the areas; an increase in the frequency of caprines in Area C (in respect to the PPNB) as opposed</page><page sequence="68">148 NIMROD GETZOV et al. to Area F. However, this difference could be biased due to the small excavated area and respectively sample size. The groundstone assemblages from Nahal Betzet II and Ard el Samra indicate that weaving, pounding, grinding and other related activities were common during the PPNB, PN and the ECh periods. The weaving could have been related to secondary products from animal exploitation. As stated above, this paper also aims to draw a picture for the settlement patterns in the region. It is broadly accepted that by the end of the PPNB several regions (e.g. Edom; the Negev) in the southern Levant, were abandoned, while others (e.g. Ammon, Central Jordan Valley) display continuity (Rollefson 2001; Gebel 2004; Goring-Morris 1993). Therefore it is our intention to find out, for instance, if a continuation from the end of the PPNB to the PN existed in the Akko Plain. At the present state of research other regions such as the Hula Basin (Bocquentin et al. 2007, in press), or the Judean Hills (Khalaily et al. 2007; Khalaily and Eirikh-Rose 2008) are being explored and presenting slightly different schemes. Based on the materials found in systematic surveys and excavations the settlement patterns for the Neoltithic to the Chalcolihic periods in the Akko Plain is proposed (Fig. 35). Eight out of 27 surveyed sites (ca. 30%) were idetified as PPNB.8 Except for one site (Horvat Torit, no. 14) which posibly dates to the Early PPNB the majority date to the Middle (Nahal Keziv 3 and Kabri, nos. 7, 10) and the Final PPNB (Nahal Betzet II, Ard el Samra, nos. 5, 16). The attribution to sub-stages for the remainder of the sites (Horvat Uza, Tzefat Adi and Horvat Govit, nos. 15, 21, 25) is unclear. Apparently all PPNB sites are located within the ecotone (between 20 to 60 m asl), near permanent streams in what seems as suitable lands for cultivation. It is somewhat surprising that no sites were found further to the west by the coastline as have been recorded by Carmel (Atlit Yam) and the Costal Plain (Michmoret sites) (Burian and Friedman 1965; Galili et al. 1993). This is also true for the PN (and see below). Geomorphological observations pointed out that dark grey alluvium covered the archaeological occupations at Nahal Betzet II. Therefore it is possible that some PPNB sites were located near the sea shores but remain unnoted due to coverage by the late phase of the alluvium. Another possibility is that sites were located far from the shores, due to climatic and/or ecological conditions. For example, presence of hippopotamus at Ard el Samra may suggest on swampy and marshy environment by the western part of the plain which would have made this part less suitable for "settling in". 8 Currently no PPNA sites are known in the Akko Plain, the Upper Galilee and the Hula Valley, differently from other regions in the southern Levant like the Jordan Valley (Kuijt and Goring Morris 2002: 371-372).</page><page sequence="69">NAHAL BETZET II AND ARD EL-SAMRA 149 PPN PN # Occupied site O Unoccupied site Figure 35: Settlement patterns by periods in the Akko Plain.</page><page sequence="70">150 N1MROD GETZOV et al.

The decrease in number of sites could be explained by population shift to larger settlements in the region such as Ard el Samra. The dominant PN culture in the Akko Plain was apparently the Yarmukian, despite the fact that some Lodian characteristics were noted at Horvat Uza, Stratum 20 (no. 15) (Getzov 2008a). In the Hula Basin, the opposite is true: the Yarmukian occupation was recorded only at Beisamoun (i.e. Bocquentin et al. 2007:17), while the local PN variant, recently termed the 'Korenian', was recorded at Hagoshrim V, Tell Teo (X-VIII) and Tell Ro'im West (Eisenberg et al. 2001; Getzov 2008b; 2008c; Nadler Uziel 2007).The only region where both the Yarmukian and the Lodian cultures are well represented is the Jordan Valley (Gopher and Blockman 2004: 45-47). The ECh marks a point of change in the settlement patterns in the Akko Plain; 18 sites were identified, ca. 60 % of the surveyed sites. Moreover, apparently there was a shift westwards, with some of the sites located close to the sea shores (nos. 6,8,19). In the Haifa bay area sites 19 and 25 are in the midway between the coast and the ecotone. This may correspond with the reconstruction of the shoreline which was located eastwards than present-day (Zviely et al.al. 2006: fig. 5e). Besides, there are probably several post-Wadi Rabah phases as attested at Kabri (no. 10) (Scheftelowicz 2002) and Horvat Uza, Strata 16-18 (no. 15) (Getzov 2008b; Getzov et al. in press). The ECh settlements suggest site hierarchy as some of them are large settlements, occupying more than 10 hectares, for example Kabri and Tel Kissan (nos. 10, 17); some are medium-sized sites like Ard el Samra (no. 16), ca. 5 hectares; and some are very small, less than 0.5 hectares, e.g. Tel Akziv and Nahal Evlayim (nos. 6, 20). It looks that a similar scenario occured in the Central Jordan Valley (Garfinkel 1992b:268; Milevski et al.al.al. forthcoming), including the existence of several phases within the ECh (e.g. Dag and Garfinkel 2007). Although LCh occupations were not recognized at Nahal Betzet II and Ard el Samra the settlement pattern it is presented to give a better perspective for the ECh. Two patterns are observable: (1) A shift to the east in site location from the ecotone to the Galilee highlands where the LCh settlements flourished (Frankel et al. 2001: 98-99). For instance, it was suggested elsewhere (Getzov 2007) that Peqi'in at that time was a central settlement that consisted of a large village that extended over ca. of 9 hectares and a magnificent burial cave (Gal et al. 1999). (2) Continuation in the occupation in the northern part of the Plain by the coastline at Horvat Akhziv Harbor and Naharyiah North (nos. 8, 9). The broader picture of the settlement patterns and dynamics in the Akko Plain during the late Prehistory is still to be studied, but some preliminary conclusions could be made on the basis of the presented data. There is a clear continuation in the occupation in the region from the PPNB until the ECh, with a decrease for the Lodian occurances. During the ECh there was a growth in the number of site in the region.</page><page sequence="72">15 2 NIMROD GETZOV et al. This settlement pattern must have been ifluenced by ecological factors, that affected the availbity of suitable lands for cultivation, quantities of water, etc. Social factors were probalby also active agents for these changes, but the current available archaeological evidence impede us from extracting further conclusions.
