<plain_text><page sequence="1">EMANUEL E. GARCIA, M.D. Johann Weier and Sigmund Freud: A Psychoanalytic Note on Science, Narcissism and Aggression The Riddle of Johann Weier In 1907, in answer to a request of Viennese publisher Hugo Heller to list "ten good books," Freud wrote a letter which, in addition to fulfilling the publisher's request, con tained elements that inspire curiosity. You ask me to name 'ten good books' for you, and refrain from adding to this any word of explanation. Thus you leave to me not only the choice of the books but also the interpretation of your request. Accus tomed to paying attention to small signs, I must then trust the wording in which you couch your enigmatical demand. You did not say: 'the ten most magnificent works (of world literature)', in which case I should have been obliged to reply, with so many others: Ho mer, the tragedies of Sophocles, Goethe's Faust, Shake speare's Hamlet, Macbeth, etc. Nor did you say the 'ten most significant books,' among which scientific achieve ments like those of Copernicus, of the old physician Johann Weier on the belief in witches, Darwin's De scent of Man, and others, would then have found a place (1907, p. 245).1 I must confess that when I first perused this passage I gave no thought to what I have since come to recognize as a chal lenging oddity—namely, the identification of Johann Weier as author of what Freud considered to be one of the three greatest scientific achievements in man's history. Just who was this old physician Weier, and what was his contribution? And how could Freud have chosen him above American Imago, Spring 1989, Vol. 46, No. 1, pp. 21-36.

Our mystery and puzzlement grow still deeper when we realize that in none of his pub lished works, scientific or personal, does Freud ever again refer to Weier, in contrast of course to Copernicus and Dar win. Furthermore, neither the famous 11th edition of the Encyclopaedia Brittannica (1910-11), nor the most recent one (1983) devote a section to the man Freud praised so highly. And not even a single word is attributed to Weier by Bartlett's Familiar Quotations (1980). Johann Weier is, in short, shrouded in obscurity, and Freud's curious reference is all the more intriguing as a consequence. As far as I can ascertain, only two authors have been sufficiently impressed by this peculiarity to call it to the atten tion of the public. Swales (1982) argues that Freud's knowl edge of Weier's contributions on witchcraft led him to aban don his early seduction theory of neurosis (a view which, in my opinion, is untenable).2 Historian I. B. Cohen (1985) draws attention to the collocation of Copernicus, Darwin and Weier as representing those areas where man's narcissistic self-esteem suffered deflation, namely, cosmology, biology, and psychology (p. 360). However, although Cohen de scribes Weier's fight against witch-hunting and cites as an example of Weier's medical perspicacity his psychological ex planation of pseudocyesis (p. 360), exactly how these activi ties constitute a blow to narcissism is never clarified. Freud's reference to Weier is the kind of "minute sign" or "triviality" that may suggest answers to greater problems and hence deserves our interest. With this in mind, I propose to clarify Freud's citation and to uncover points of correspon dence between psychoanalysis and the work of Weier.3 Johann Weier was born into a plebian family in 1515 or 1516 in the town of Grave, a part of what is today known as the Netherlands. When he was 15 years old or so he appren ticed himself to the scholar Cornelius Agrippa, with whom he resided and studied for approximately two years. Agrip pa, a physician, was a highly original thinker who, among other things, courageously denounced witch-hunting and championed women. Weier then traveled to Paris and Or leans and in 1537 received his medical degree. While little is</page><page sequence="3">Emanuel E. Garcia, M.D. 23 known of the next eight years of his life, in 1545 we find that Weier was appointed municipal physician to Arnhem, a post which he would hold for five years. In 1550 he became per sonal physician to Duke Wilhelm of Cleve. He remained at the court of Cleve until 1578, where he was provided with a learned and liberal refuge highly conducive to his steadfast and imperturbable pursuit of medical research. These inves tigations would culminate in his masterwork, De Praestigiis Daemonum et Incantationibus ac Veneficiis (About the Delusions of Demons, Sorcery, and Poisoning), published in 1563. Weier was able to see his book through six Latin and two German editions before his death in Tecklenburg in 1588, at the age of 72. During the sixteenth century Europe was being ravaged by the relentless inroads of ignorance, disease and war. De spite the many great advances of the Renaissance, a scien tific approach to the study of the human mind was lacking. Religious superstition and cruelty ruled the day. The Inqui sition, guided by the Malleus Maleficarum (The Sledgeham mer against Witches) of Kramer and Sprenger (1486), a stupifying collection of perverse, sadistic absurdity on all aspects of witchcraft, indefatigably tried and executed thou sands of so-called witches or sorcerers, principally women. A favorite instrument of justice was the "water test": the accused would be bound and thrown into a stream; if she floated, she would be burned at the stake, if she drowned, she was declared innocent. Such were the times in which Weier raised his voice. Weier was known as a medical empiricist in the best sense: he took nothing for granted and he devoted a great deal of effort to precise clinical description. In fact, he gave excellent accounts of trichinosis, typhus, pleurisy, erysipelas, syphilis, and even scurvy (Ehrlich, 1960; Zilboorg, 1969, p. 122). He exposed carefully and lucidly the ridiculous "reasoning" of the Malleus, point by point. Despite being a severe critic of the violent cruelty of witch-hunting, he was nevertheless a pious man and a believer (probably a Lutheran). However, he seems to have achieved renown more for his humanistic, rather than scientific, legacy. He left no theoretical edifice behind, and no Weierian school of medicine survived him. There is little</page><page sequence="4">24 Weier and Freud doubt, however, that he was one of the few to whom the hu man race is so indebted for whatever progress it has made: a true genius. Here I would like to convey some examples of Weier's skill and insight. He was assiduous in ruling out all possible natural causes of phenomena that were so easily assumed to be the work of supernatural beings. For example, rather than accept de monic explanations for suppression of menstrual flow, Weier was able to diagnose the condition of imperforate hymen and to direct surgeons to correct it through incision, thus leading to the establishment of normal menstruation. In the case of a young girl who was reputed to have fasted for over a year, and was consequently considered to be supernatural, Weier discovered that she was secretly being fed by her sister—a case of what we might today call "unconscious" malingering (Mora, 1963, p. 421). On another occasion he absolved a witch accused of causing an epidemic among cattle, advising not the execution of the accused, but an eminently more reasonable solution—fumigation of the cattle. Weier brilliantly anticipated our modern notion of sug gestion by acknowledging the efficacy of magical cures of possession which were based on a power of the mind, and in recognizing the role confidence played in symptoms such as impotence (Cobben, pp. 25, 51, 56, 88). He investigated a group of nuns in Cologne who sustained convulsions which were (of course) attributed to the devil. He traced the root of these mass "seizures," whose erotic form did not escape his observing eye, to a secret love affair conducted by one or two of the nuns with local youths. Weier reports that upon cessa tion of the amorous activities, the convulsions served the pur pose of fulfilling in fantasy what reality denied (Zilboorg, 1969, pp. 182-184). He even appears to have described a case of globus hystericus. Weier was called to examine a young girl who was pur portedly vomiting strange objects that had been introduced into her stomach by the devil. After palpitating her abdomen and establishing the absence of pathologic masses, he pro ceeded to inspect the objects she had presumably regurgi tated. He noted that only saliva, and not gastric chylus, was present on these objects, and was thus able to satisfy himself</page><page sequence="5">Emanuel E. Garcia, M.D. 25 that they could not have entered the stomach. Further ques tioning of the girl enabled him to trace the onset of her vomiting to her having drunk holy water in an effort to re lieve mild abdominal discomfort. One by one he debunked the claims of the Malleus. He saw in juggling not the trickery of Satan, but of a skillful man; in impotence not bewitchment but physiological or psychological dysfunction. He provided chemical and pharmacologic expla nations of hallucinations, and emphasized individualizing the treatment of those whom he perceived as mentally ill. He un derstood psychopathology to be the basis for bizarre thoughts and behaviors which others regarded as purposeful—a point of supreme importance. He saw those accused of witchcraft not as willful malefactors deserving torture and death, but as poor suffering human beings whose imaginations were de ranged by poisons, melancholia or devilish possession. He writes: "Witches can harm no one through the most malicious will or the ugliest exorcism, that rather their imagination— inflamed by the demons in a way not understandable to us— and the torture of melancholy makes them only fancy that they have caused all sorts of evil" (quoted in Zilboorg, 1969, p. 119). This view of man as a victim of unknown mental forces presciently foreshadowed Freud's revolution. An adequate summary of the massive De Praestigiis—the book to which Freud undoubtedly was referring in his letter to Heller—is beyond our scope.4 Suffice it to say that, al though nearly forgotten nowadays, it was a landmark of sci ence and humanism. In it, Weier sought to wrest the investi gation of psychological phenomena from the inflexible grasp of theologians and to bring it into the domain of physicians. He introduced the concept of delusion into medical history and he recognized the mechanism of projection in the atti tude and behavior of the Inquisitors, who attributed their own perverse wishes and delusions to the people they tor tured (Meerloo, 1963). According to one historian, (Mora, 1963, p. 422), the De Praestigiis anticipated notions of modern psychotherapy by establishing the importance of unconscious forces in the therapeutic relationship. And although Weier actually believed in demonic beings and their supernatural doings, he drastically curtailed their supposed power. He</page><page sequence="6">26 Weier and Freud marked the Inquisitors themselves, whose unbridled cruelty knew no bounds, as the devil's henchmen. In the context of the times, the De Praestigiis was a monumental achievement. The book earned for Weier a place on the Inquisition's Index librorum prohibitorum. A 16th century Jesuit was quoted as saying indignantly, in response to Weier, "If doctors were permitted to express their opinions, no one would be burned!" (Zilboorg, 1969, p. 198). Weier himself was ac cused of sorcery, as his mentor Agrippa had been. Although dubbed the father of modern psychiatry and championed by a handful of historians,5 he is virtually unknown today. And despite the fact that we frequently invoke the principle that it is better to let ten guilty go free than to condemn one innocent person to death, few realize that Johann Weier was its author. But let us return to the riddle with which we began. Is Freud's citation of Weier any clearer? An evaluation of each of Freud's explicit references to Copernicus and Darwin6 reveals an important finding: in three of the four passages where they appear together, they are linked with psychoanalysis as deliverers of cosomological, biological and psychological blows to man's narcissism (Freud, 1916-17, p. 284; 1917, p. 140; 1925a, p. 221).71 quote from a representative passage: In the course of centuries the naïve self-love of men has had to submit to two major blows at the hands of sci ence. The first was when they learnt that our earth was not the centre of the universe but only a tiny fragment of a cosmic system of scarcely imaginable vastness. This is associated in our minds with the name of Copernicus, though something similar had already been asserted by Alexandrian science. The second blow fell when biologi cal research destroyed man's supposedly privileged place in creation and proved his descent from the ani mal kingdom and his ineradicable animal nature. This revaluation has been accomplished in our own days by Darwin, Wallace and their predecessors, though not without the most violent contemporary opposition. But human megalomania will have suffered its third and most wounding blow from the psychological research</page><page sequence="7">Emanuel E. Garcia, M.D. 27 of the present time which seeks to prove to the ego that it is not even master in its own house, but must content itself with scanty information of what is going on uncon sciously in its mind. We psycho-analysts were not the first and not the only ones to utter this call to introspec tion; but it seems to be our fate to give it its most forcible expression and to support it with empirical material which affects every individual (1916-17, pp. 284-285). This passage leads me to the following conclusions about Freud's comment to Heller: (1) that Freud saw Weier's work, like that of Coper nicus and Darwin, as constituting a blow to narcissism. (This is further supported by Freud's seleciton of Dar win's Descent of Man, with its emphasis on man's spe cific similarity with the animal kingdom, and its "quiet determination to bring the study of man's religious beliefs under the hegemony of natural science" (Ste vens, 1978, p. 83), over his Origin of Species, the work universally acknowledged to be his greatest. See Co hen, p. 361.) (2) that in some way Freud identified the work of psy choanalysis with Weier's contributions; and (3) that the reduction of man's narcissism is an essential aspect of great scientific achievement. It seems quite probable that Freud knew about Weier through the works of Lecky, Binz and Bourneville (Swales, pp. 23-25). The latter, a pupil of Charcot, reedited and pub lished a French translation of De Praestigiis in 1883, as part of the Biblioteque Diabolique, a series on the history of hysteria which Charcot sponsored (Mora, 1963, p. 418; Swales, p. 23). It is not unreasonable to assume that Freud, prodigious reader that he was, and avid student of hysteria under the great Charcot, would have acquainted himself with the De Praestigiis. In fact, the tone and substance of his letter to Heller imply intimate knowledge of and familiarity with ev ery other book he mentions; ignorance of Weier's would have proved anomalous. In any case, I believe I am now in a position to clarify Freud's reference to Weier and to provide support for the above conclusions.</page><page sequence="8">28 Weier and Freud Weier struck his blow against man's narcissism in two re lated ways. First, he asserted that the witch-hunting Inquisi tors, self-proclaimed paragons of reason and unerring judges of heresy, were unwittingly carrying out the evils of the very being they purported to be extirpating, i.e., Satan (Zilboorg, 1969, pp. 115-117). On several occasions Freud noted paral lels between the medieval (sic) theory of possession and his own theory of the neuroses, identifying the devil with the unconscious, i.e., as a "foreign body" of repressed instinctual impulses within the mind (1888, p. 41; 1893, p. 20; 1919, p. 243; 1923, p. 72; 1985, pp. 224-225—letter of 17 January 1897 to Fliess). By thus declaring the witch-hunts and persecu tions to be the fulfillment of diabolical intent, Weier provided a precise example of just how far the ego was from being master in its own house. His depiction of the accused as passive victims of devilish possession who were deluded by the "for eign body" into believing the reality of their bizarre utterances is an equivalent illustration of the same. The De Praestigiis was a resounding "call to introspection" to the Inquisitors by way of exposing the delusion under which they labored. Second, and to my mind, most importantly, is Weier's demolition of man's primitive animistic belief in the omnipo tence of his thoughts. This furnishes the key to his role re garding narcissism and his link to psychoanalysis. Time after time in the De Praestigiis, Weier inveighs against this absur dity, noting the common belief among the Inquisitors in the absolute power of the witches' words and will to accomplish anything (Cobben, pp. 75-77, 87-88, 96-97, 108, 110, 113, 115-121). He relates, for example, how judges accepted as pure fact the confession of a woman who, before her execu tion, claimed responsibility for the harsh winter of 1565 (Cobben, p. 110). And in addressing the contentions of oth ers that the mere will to commit witchcraft deserved the same punishment as the witchcraft itself, Weier writes what is the most significant and revolutionary portion of his work (which I quote in Cobben's paraphrase): The witch's will, like that of any person, is actually a thought, for which no one can be punished. Ideas, after all, are toll-free (Cobben, p. 118).</page><page sequence="9">Emanuel E. Garcia, M.D. 29 The revolutionary nature of this statement, offered at a time when masses of people scorned to distinguish between thought and act, desire and deed, following the example of their Deity when he meted out punishment; at a time when human megalomania asserted itself through the endowment of mere wishes with the power to bring about calamities and catastrophic destruction—this constituted a triumph of both science and humanism that cannot be overestimated. Weier thus dealt the narcissism of man a telling wound. In Totem and Taboo Freud explicitly characterized the over valuation of psychical acts, i.e., belief in omnipotence of thoughts, as an essential component of narcissism (1913, pp. 89-90); and he identified the survival of omnipotence of thoughts in all neuroses, thus essentially uncovering the nar cissistic core of these disorders (1913, p. 86). Weier's demon stration of the baselessness of this belief and its implied equation of thought and deed proved an apt forerunner of Freud's work, a goal of which would be to grant man com plete freedom of thought, so that ultimately "no ethical ban will be put on any fantasy that man may evolve" (Eissler, K.R., 1971b, p. 301). It was an event comparable in magnitude to that which occurred when Little Hans confessed his oedipal wishes to his father, marking probably the first time in history that a child had been able to do so without being prevented by the overwhelming fear of incurring punishment in accordance with the lex talionis (see Eissler, K.R., 1965, pp. 212-213). But even the father of Little Hans, as enlightened as he was by Freud and by his knowledge of psychoanalysis, fell into the Inquisitor-like attitude of condemning mere thought. In response to Hans's expressed wish for his sister's death, he attempted to convince him that ' "A good boy doesn't wish that sort of thing" ' (Freud, 1909, p. 72). The astute Hans, however, persisted in defending his right to think whatever he pleased, recognizing the all-important distinction be tween thought and deed, and thus earning Freud's ap plause and the comment "I could wish for no better under standing of psycho-analysis from any grown-up" (1909, p. 72). Indeed, Little Hans had surpassed his father in this regard.</page><page sequence="10">30 Weier and Freud Science and Narcissism Freud provides the groundwork for understanding the relationship between narcissism and science with his consider ation of the evolution of the world-view of the human race: At the animistic stage men ascribe omnipotence to themselves. At the religious stage they transfer it to the gods but do not seriously abandon it themselves, for they reserve the power of influencing the gods in a variety of ways according to their wishes. The scien tific view of the universe no longer affords any room for human omnipotence; men have acknowledged their smallness and submit resignedly to death and to the other necessities of nature (1913, p. 88).8 Narcissism and science do not mix. One may conclude that true scientific discovery is only possible when narcissistic interference in the evaluation of the external world has been reduced to a minimum. In the clinical setting, Freud spoke of the danger of the psychoana lyst's "projecting outwards some of the peculiarities of his own personality, which he has dimly perceived, into the field of science, as a theory having universal validity" (1912, p. 117). Actually, in one of the ten good books Freud finally came around to recommending to Heller (1907, p. 246), Merejkowski's Romance of Leonardo da Vinci (which inciden tally contains a vivid portrait of the Inquisition's witch ma nia), Leonardo warns the artist-scientist who wishes to hold the mirror up to Nature to "Be on thy guard lest the men and women thou dost depict seem thy brethren and sisters, thy doubles, either in their beauty or their hideousness. . . . For in painting there is no more dangerous and treacherous er ror than imitating one's own body" (p. 170). The myth of Narcissus tells us not only that self absorption prevents one from taking action in the world by rooting one irretrievably to a fixed spot; it also symbolically reminds us of the perils of projection, in that the hero's image serves as a reflective barrier to perception of the stream and its contents, i.e., underlying reality. In essence, the less man sees of himself in his surroundings, the more accurate will be his</page><page sequence="11">Emanuel E. Garcia, M.D. 31 perception of them, and thus the sounder the basis for effec tive action. Insofar as a scientist is shackled by the compulsion to repeat, and to demand from his environment a repetition of those patterns and notions he has assimilated and which have come to be accepted as part of himself, i.e., to be guided by wishful thinking, he will be prohibited from divining those interrelations among the matter and substance of the world which defy his preconceived views. Man's tendency to project his image onto Nature (usually in a way which lends support to its overvaluation) is apparent in a multitude of phenomena, e.g., anthropomorphism in the study of animal behavior. It constitutes the greatest obstacle to science. For Freud, science is no abstract pursuit: it possesses a distinctly practical value as a tool for the mastery of Nature and the diminution of human misery. Science is a means of bettering the human lot. The necessary and logical extension of the scientific attitude in the broad social sphere is revealed by Freud's criticisms of societies that perpetrate injustices. He writes, for example, that a "civilization which leaves so large a number of its participants unsatisfied and drives them into revolt neither has nor deserves the prospect of a lasting exis tence" (1927, p. 12). And despite his profound misgivings about the Russian revolution, he nevertheless admitted that it seemed "like the message of a better future" (1933, p. 181). Furthermore, in a recently discovered letter to the Vienna daily Neue Freie Presse, Freud as private citizen proposed a system of self-taxation whereby those who were gainfully em ployed could alleviate the hardships of the great number of unfortunates who were without a livelihood (Eissler &amp; Eis sler, 1983). In this context, the image of Weier, who so clearly exemplified the humanistic application of scientific knowl edge, looms large, and yet another aspect of the correspon dence between his work and Freud's becomes apparent. Narcissism and Aggression It was no coincidence that Weier, who deflated human megalomania, should also have proved to be a vociferous enemy of the inhuman cruelties that characterized the witch</page><page sequence="12">32 Weier and Freud trials of the Renaissance: narcissism and aggression seem to be inseparable partners, indissolubly linked. Freud rightly identified aggression as "the greatest impediment to civiliza tion" (1930, p. 122). Furthermore, he described an all important feature of the discharge of aggression, namely, that "in the blindest fury of destructiveness, we cannot fail to recognize that the satisfaction of the instinct is accompanied by a high degree of narcissistic enjoyment, owing to its pre senting the ego with a fulfillment of the latter's old wishes for omnipotence" (1930, p. 121). Aggression, in fact, appears to be the primary means to the attainment of narcissistic gratifica tion, affording a triumph of the like that love cannot come close to providing (Eissler, K.R., 1971a, p. 72). And it remains a curious phenomenon that in groups the binding power of Eros is effective only when aggression can be directed against outsiders (Freud, 1930, p. 114). But even here we must be careful not to fall into the temptation of overestimating the forces of Eros: as Freud drily observed, "all the massacres of the Jews in the Middle Ages did not suffice to make that period more peaceful and secure for their Christian fellows" (1930, p. 114). Denial, neglect and passivity can be potent expressions of aggression and destruction as well. With man's presence dominating the planet, and his capacity for beneficial exploi tation of natural resources considerable, we would seem to be in an ideal position to fulfill the Dostoyevskyan ethic of global responsibility. Yet an embarrassingly large portion of the earth's population remains squalid, diseased, shelterless and ill-nourished. Man's narcissistic imperative precludes recogni tion of a realm lying outside the relatively miniscule ken of our desires—a fact which is all the more tragic considering the potential of our communications media to make the re cesses of the globe regularly accessible to our perception. Epilogue In one of the great Shakespearean plays (yet another work mentioned by Freud in his letter to Heller), Lady Mac beth issues this challenge to her spouse:</page><page sequence="13">Emanuel E. Garcia, M.D. 33 Art thou afeard To be the same in thine own act and valour As thou art in desire? (Macbeth, I, vii, 39-41) Now that the omnipotence of thought which Joahnn Weier struggled so vigorously to debunk may actually be real ized in our new-found capacity to annihilate the world, Lady Macbeth's siren call to narcissistic barbarism cannot be more ominous. Freud, after all, recognized that "men always put their newly acquired instruments of power at the service of their aggressiveness and use them against one another" (1933, p. 177). Yet he firmly believed that the soft voice of reason would ultimately gain a hearing and finally succeed (1927, p. 53), and he left us a stirring image. When he turned his attention to Michelangelo's Moses, Freud discovered that the great Florentine sculptor had sig nificantly modified the Biblical story of the broken Tables of the Law. Instead of depicting an enraged Moses in the act of demolishing the divine Tablets, he shows us a man who had been able to calm his wrath. Thus the giant frame with its tremendous physical power becomes only a concrete expression of the highest mental achievement that is possible in a man, that of struggling successfully against an inward passion for the sake of a cause to which he has devoted himself (1914a, p. 233). The mission of psychoanalysis, whose hallmark is the interposi tion of delay between impulse and action, cannot be clearer— or more urgent. Emanuel E.

In the fourth they are cited along with Kepler, Newton, Lavoisier, Curie, Ar chimedes, and Aristarchos of Samos in connection with the relative youth of scientific activity in man's history (1933, p. 173). It is tempting to speculate that, with the addition of Charcot, we would have a list of Freud's ten pre-eminent scientists. 8. Compare Freud (1917, p. 139): "We speak of the narcissism of small children, and it is to the excessive narcissism of primitive man that we ascribe his belief in the omnipotence of his thoughts and his consequent attempts to influence the course of events in the external world by the technique of magic." 9. It is noteworthy that one of Freud's favorite authors, Ludwig Börne (1786 1837), whose essay on creative writing is credited with exerting a decisive influ ence on Freud's development of the technique of free association, was "an idealist, a fighter for freedom, honesty, justice, and sincerity, and always op posed to oppression" (Jones, p. 246).
