<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN ONTOLOG1CAL EXAMINATION OF CAUSATION MOST of the metaphysical objections to the notion of a past event's necessitating in any way a present or a future event reduce to a single argument. They depend on an assump tion regarding the ontological status of the past. The past is made up of a compact series of previous present moments, each of which was in turn the setting against which all actuality was marked off from the virtual realms both of memory and expecta tion. The past is, without doubt, fixed, dead and impotent. In fact the very meaning of the past is precisely the locus of activity that has been gone through and is now finished. Though these characterizations of the past are certainly true, many empiricists claim that these characterizations justify the following assump tion: that the past cannot affect the present or the future, so that each present moment is a fresh atomic temporal setting, with only accidental connection to the past. It would be a rare empiricist who would explicitly make such an assumption. Yet if we examine a few particular arguments brought against the concept of causality, we find this assumption almost invariably present. For instance, in Hume's argument against necessary connection the crux of the argument is the externality to each other of temporal events that are supposed to be connected: "All events seems entirely loose and separate. One event follows another; but we never can observe any tie between them. They seem conjoined, but not connected." The only real ontological elements in Hume's system are atomic momentary sense impres sions, each having no possible mode of connection to the past. Hence for Hume the past is utterly cut off from the present and future, and his logic is correct in denying that there is necessary connection. (His logical deductions are correct, but they are unfortunately derived from false epistemological premisses.) The assumption that the dead past cannot influence the present or future is even more obvious in an argument against causation given by Collingwood in his Essay on Metaphysics: 52</page><page sequence="2">Ontological Examination of Causation 53 "If I set fire to one end of a time-fuse, and five minutes later the charge at the other end explodes, there is said to be a causal connection between the first and second events, and a time-interval of five minutes between them. But this interval is occupied by the burning of the fuse at a determin ate rate of feet per minute; and this process is a conditio sine qua non of causal efficacy ascribed to the first event. That is to say, the connection between the lighting of the fuse and the detonation of the charge is causal in the loose sense, not the tight one.* If in the proposition 4x causes the explosion' we wish to use the word 'cause' in the tight sense, x must be so defined as to include in itself every such con ditio sine qua non. It must include the burning of the whole fuse; not its burning until 'just before' that process reaches the detonator, for then there would still be an interval to be bridged, but its burning until the detonator is reached. Only then is the cause in sense III (i. e., the tight sense) com plete. The denial of actio in distans, spatial or temporal, where the agent is the cause in sense III is therefore not a prejudice, but is logically involved in the definition of sense III." Here the assumption that because the past is no longer actual it is for that reason no longer effective has led Collingwood to the assertion that no event is strictly the cause of another unless the two events are spatially and temporarily congruent; that is, an event is a cause of itself, but neither causes nor is caused by any other event, a most unlikely state of affairs! ? 1. Hume and his disciples have brought other arguments against necessary connection, but I believe that their most vital arguments all involve the assumption that the past is non-ef fective. Now the negative arguments against Hume and Mill, etc., showing that mere uniform sequence cannot account for causation as we know it have been well-rehearsed elsewhere, and I shall not review them here. But when all the demonstrations of Hume's inconsistency are done, it is still necessary to give a * 'Sense III' or the "tight sense' in Collingwood's discussion refers to causation in the metaphysical sense of an event in nature necessitating in some way a consequent event. This sense is to be contrasted with the looser practical senses of affording a motive, and exercising practical control.</page><page sequence="3">54 Abner Shimony positive reply to his objections. The idea of the material cause or ontological continuity is, I hope to show, a positive rationale for causation in four ways: 1. It makes sense of the causation of one physical event by another. 2. It makes sense of a large class of sequences of mental events. 3. It explains the 'activity' that seems apparent in causation. 4. It provides the only rational explanation for natural law. Note, however, that the establishment of the importance of such a cause does not give conclusive evidence one way or the other on the question of determinism versus indeterminism. It merely shows how one event can, to a greater or less degree, necessitate a future event. 1. Let us first see how the material cause, that is, ontological continuity, provides a rationale for the necessary connection between physical events. Again let us consider Hume's billiard balls. The first question that arises is: on what grounds can we say, however expected or unexpected the behavior of the billiard balls may be after impact, that their behavior is in any way con nected with the fact of their impact? If the past is truly dead, then the past impact has nothing to do with their present be havior. The only answer I can see to this, besides some appeal to a tender God's constant recreation of the world as supposed by Descartes, is that the past in itself is certainly dead, but that some of the actual entities which composed the actuality of the past are surviving. The billiard balls that participated in an impact five seconds ago are the same billiard balls that are rolling away from each other at a given velocity and a given angle now. The past in itself does not survive; but actual entities which bear the scars of the past enter into the present, so that indirectly through certain messengers the past is still operative. Now if there are no such surviving entities, that is, no material cause, the past is utterly cut off from the present and future. This is precisely what happens in Hume's system, where the only actualities are sense impressions. Sense impressions are momentary items which do not bridge the past and future. Hence there is no way for Hume's past to operate on his present and future. But in the real world as we know it, there are surviving entities which supply us with</page><page sequence="4">Ontological Examination of Causation 55 a material cause, and hence some sort of connection between the past and future is possible. A second question arises with regard to the behavior of the billiard balls: why should not the billiard balls after impact do something utterly irrelevant, like reciting Virgil? Hume would say that we can give no a priori reason for supposing that the impact should not be followed by such an exhibition. Again an appeal to the material cause restores sanity to the situation. The billiard balls do not recite Virgil because they remain billiard balls?that is, entities which have not the capacity for poetics. Of course they might have done something unexpected, like ex ploding, but this phenomenon would have been explicable by material causation also; it would have meant that what survived was not ordinary billiard balls, but celluloid spheres with a charge of mercury fulminate or some such explosive. The fact that the explosion was unexpected while the rolling away was not, is a matter of psychology and epistemology, but has no bear ing on the metaphysical problem of causation. A third question that arises in making an analysis similar to Hume's is more profound: is there any reason why, of the infinite number of possible courses of action that seem plausible for a pair of billiard balls after impact, the two balls should have followed one particular course, and seem to do so consistently under certain favorable circumstances? I think the answer is that there is such a reason. In classical physics there was not, and the laws of conservation of energy and of momentum, as Mach states, were nothing but formalization of empirical evidence or at best, hypotheses which enjoyed a considerable degrees of suc cess. In modern physics, physical law is becoming more and more perfectly explicable as imminent in the material bodies and space-time themselves. 2. The problem of causality among mental events is a more complex one. I shall not try to treat of all cases of causation in volving mental events because I do not want to embark on the body-mind problem here. But even in the special class of cases which involve only mental events material causation enters in a peculiar way. C. S. Peirce* seems to be the first to point out clear * The Collected Papers of C. S. Peirce, 6.107, 6.109.</page><page sequence="5">56 Abner Shimony ly that unless there is positive survival of ideas logic and memory lose their meaning: "How can a past idea be present? Can it be present vicariously? To a certain extent, perhaps, but not merely so; for then the question would arise how the past idea can be related to its vicarious representation. The relation, being between ideas, can only exist in some consciousness: now that past idea was in no consciousness but that past conscious ness that alone contained it; and that did not embrace the vicarious idea. How can a past idea be present? Not vicariously. Then only by direct perception. In other words, to be present, it must be ipso facto present. That is, it cannot be wholly past; it can only be going, infinitesimally past, less past than any assignable past date. We are thus brought to the conclusion that the present is connected with the past by a series of real infinitesimal steps." Peirce has put his finger on one of Hume's most vulnerable points. If Hume's sense impressions are strictly momentary, then there is no relation of a past impression to a present or future one. The result is that not only could we not know anything about the past, but that we could not even have any idea that there is time and passage of time at all, unless by some inexplicable de vice our present perceptions kept insisting upon temporality. This weakness in Hume's system may be pursued yet further. When we reason syllogistically, the process of our thought takes time. Hence when we are given the major premiss "All men are mortal" and the minor premiss "Socrates is a man" we do not instantaneously reflect "Socrates is a man" however often we have been drilled in this boring syllogism. Therefore if our ideas are sheer momentary impressions, we really have no way of saying either the term "Socrates" or the term "man" as appear ing in the conclusion have any connection with those terms as appearing in the major and the minor premisses. Logic would be forbidden fruit to humans, unless, as Peirce insists, there is some survival of ideas. Actually, I do not think we need go as far as Peirce, in pos tulating survival of ideas. Peirce is in the empiricist tradition stemming from Berkeley and has difficulty in conceiving how we can have abstract ideas apart from concrete sense impressions.</page><page sequence="6">Ontological Examination of Causation 57 Therefore in order to explain logic and memory he maintains that for at least a short extent of time, the precise impressions, with all the peripheral frills and subjective emotional tones must survive. I am in no position to go into the epistemology of the question now, but it does seem that we do have abstract ideas with which we can deal with great precision of thought and to which we can return again and again despite great differences in the setting of those ideas. These abstract ideas and their counterparts in the realm of emotions, the pale half-preserved feelings of recollection, are the mental entities which must and do survive in order that we may have memory and logic. Mental events are necessarily connected because of the survival of these ideas. Hence material causation, that is ontological survival? however contradictory the terminology may sound?is at the root of the problem of causation even when mental events are concerned. 3. Schopenhauer and Martineau realized that the world is more than a congeries of logical terms. They therefore insisted that if there actually is a relation of causation between events in the world that relation should consist of more than mere logical ground and consequence. They insisted that in some real way, the cause must exert compulsion on the effect, bringing it about directly. With all this I agree. But I cannot follow Martineau when he insists that Being cannot produce the activity of causa tion, so that an unobservable transcendental Power must be postu lated in order to explain causation. His appeal to the use of the notion of force in classical physics shows just how weak his argu ment is. There was no more tenuous or mysterious notion in classical physics than the notion of Force. Certainly it never meant the same thing as the anthropomorphic conception of pushes and pulls except in an allegorical sense. It was merely the hypostasis of the product ma which occured frequently in physi cal formulae. And relativistic physics has done well to dispense with the notion of force and deal with motions in space-time directly instead. Indeed it seems to me that the whole conception of transcendent force and energy is bound up in mysticism. If there is nothing immanent in Being to explain the causal con nection between phenomena, then how does Power explain this connection? Is not Power itself a mode of Being? If Being is in</page><page sequence="7">58 Abner Shimony capable of causing action, how is it liable to action? And does it not require yet another agent to explain how Power can act upon inert Being? Martineau's Being and his Power seem to be long to disparate realms, neither of which have any possible way of affecting the other, even though Martineau insists that Power does operate on Being. The material cause (as we have seen above), does supply a rationale for causation. But I believe it also explains the activi ty which Martineau sees in causation, without appealing to a transcendental and essentially irrational "power." Martineau felt it necessary to postulate his "Power" because he was considering Being as nothing more than Humian phenomena. Humian phenomena have no force whatsoever, for the simple reason that they are not concrete realities, but merely the sensuous correlates of concrete beings in action. If an event consists of nothing but phenomenal elements it cannot influence another event. But an event is the pattern of interplay of actual elements. As we have seen in describing material causation, these actual elements sur vive and are ontologically continuous with some of the concrete elements involved in the effect. The behavior of these concrete elements in the time interval between the two events constitutes the activity which Martineau correctly says is present in causation. The pulling of a trigger actively causes the death of a man, be cause the behavior of a bullet in the interval between the firing and the death is the activity of travelling first through the barrel of the gun, then through the atmosphere, and finally through human flesh and bone. Power is therefore not at all transcen dent. It is a component in the functioning of Beings. Martineau's error is in considering Being as essentially inert. But Being is essentially dynamic. As Plato states in the Sophists "We said that being was an active or passive energy arising out of a certain power which proceeds from elements meeting with one another." ... The material cause, then, explains both the rationality and the muscularity of causation. 4. Finally, ontological survival provides a rationale for causa tion by at least partially explaining the meaning of natural law. No discussion of the problem of causation would be at all satis factory until such an explanation were indicated; for we mean by causation the delimitation of the future by the present and</page><page sequence="8">Ontological Examination of Causation 59 past. Insofar as this delimitation is arbitrary and capricious, we cannot even say that there was any delimitation; we can only say that what happened did happen. And insofar as the delimitation is meaningful and rational it can be expressed with greater or less accuracy by natural law. Hence, whether we believe that the delimitation of the future is absolutely unambiguous, as do the determinists, or only partial as Peirce and Whitehead believe, we must explain how this delimitation is expressible in natural law. ? 2. There are three important historical conceptions of the meaning of law. (I hope to show that only adequate one depends on ontological survival, that is, the material cause. The three conceptions are:) a. Law is the general expression of observed persistence in nature. b. Law is transcendent, imposed by some Power standing off against nature. c. Law is the expression of tendencies, qualities and relations immanent in Beings. These are, in order, the empiricist, the supernaturalist, and the rationalist interpretations of the meaning of law. a. The empiricist view has both a dogmatic and a sceptical facet. Hume's exposition seems to stress the latter. That is, he holds that our knowledge neither confirms nor positively belies the possibility of there being an ultimate metaphysical explana tion for law. Hence the best we can do is devise practical modes of predicting future events from past experience, without try ing to give ultimate reasons for the success of our predicitions. There is no need to refute such a view; one need only show that good explanations of causation can be given without getting into any paradoxes. (The more dogmatic form of empiricism seems to be asserted by the logical positivists, to the effect that there is no rationale to causation, and that there is no justifica tion in the world for our assertion of natural law except our own past experience. I shall not give a detailed criticism of this view, since the considerations stated by Joseph and Blanshard seem to me absolutely decisive.)</page><page sequence="9">60 Abner Shimony b. That law is transcendent or, as Whitehead terms it (Ad ventures of Ideas) 'imposed' is a doctrine of considerable strength. There are innumerable patterns and persistencies in nature that seem inexplicable even after prolonged investigation. In fact the doctrine of Imposed Law seems to be Newton's own metaphysical explanation of why his law of gravitation held true. Since the primary particles in his mechanics were characterized primarily by inertia, he found no principle internal to matter that could justify the inverse square law of motion. As Whitehead says: "He definitely stated that the correlated modes of be havior of the bodies forming the solar system required God for the imposition of the principles on which all depend. He was certainly doubtful, indeed more than doubtful, whether the Law of Gravity was the ultimate statement of principles imposed by God. But he certainly thought that the concep tion of the solar system exhibited in his Principia was suf ficiently ultimate to make obvious the necessity of a God imposing Law." The doctrine of imposed law is certainly attractive in view of the splendor of the regularities in nature and in view of our apparent inability to give ultimate rationales for these regulari ties. But there are two metaphysical considerations which make this position extremely dubious. First of all, the argument from the appearance of law to a lawgiver is a form of the Cosmological argument for the existence of God, an argument which Kant has largely discredited. The second is that the doctrine of im posed law reduces the only reality which we know directly, the Nature which we are trying to explain, to the realm of appear ance. For as I emphasized in discussing Martineau's theory of power, Being is nothing if it is not active, if "it doesn't make a difference." Hence if the behavior of things in Nature is im posed from a source outside Nature, it would seem that what ever they essentially are is imposed externally, and the things in Nature are only appearances of a transcendent Reality. A possible answer to this second criticism of Imposed Law is to be found in Plato's Timaeus. In the Platonic cosmology the rational behavior of the world, or Law as we would now call it, is indeed imposed from without by the Demiurgos. But brute nature is also real because it supplies a sort of irrational activity to the</page><page sequence="10">Ontological Examination of Causation 61 intermediate or mixed world in which we actually live. This reply to our second criticism is really confirmation of it; for in the Timaeus, the forms and the rational activity determined thereby, are, after the creation (whether the creation is temporal or ontological makes no difference at this point), Immanent in the things of Nature, and no longer merely transcending Nature. And Immanent law is precisely the doctrine which I wish to affirm here. Note however, that even though the material cause is most evident in Immanent Law, it is even at the root of the doctrine of Transcendental Law. And though I have repudiated the doctrine of Transcendental or Imposed Law, the fact that even it is dependent on the material cause is further evidence for the all-pervasiveness and explanatory power of the material cause. If law is beyond and above nature it must have a real locus beyond and above nature. Plato himself altered his earlier doc trine of an independent and self-existing realm of forms when he realized that such an isolated set of forms could not even be exemplified in the world of appearances (Parmenides, 129 ff.), much less produce a world. Aristotle goes further by positing the form of the world in an actual thinking mind, the Unmoved Mover. Without some actually surviving Being in which the Law rests, then, the Law is set adrift and is impotent to act upon the world. This Being provides the ontological continuity between all events, since it is the constant interfering operator on Nature. Hence, by our definition above, this Being is the Material Cause of all events. c. This excursion into the transcendent, was, however, really unnecessary, since we have seen above that only an Immanent Law gives a satisfactory meaning to the regular behavior of nature. Activity is of the essence of Being, and if regularity turns out to be of the essence of natural activity, then regularity is of the essence of Being. Both the empiricist and the transcendental conceptions of natural law force an artificial dichotomy between being as such and being as it behaves in the real world. But the doctrine of Immanent Law expresses the absurdly simple truth that since things are what they are largely because they act as they do, therefore their action is inseparable from their being. It is easy to see that the material cause is the leitmotif in</page><page sequence="11">62 Abner Shimony Immanent Law. For what we now mean by Law is the expression of tendencies, qualities and relations within beings. But if there are no actually surviving entities, there is no locus for law at all. And conversely, the survivial of entities allows the law which is immanent within those entities to be exhibited in events. It might be argued that ontological survival is not a prerequisite for immanent law; that law is the expression of the tendencies, qualities and relations of actualities at each instant. But this argument breaks down for two reasons. First, because natural law is needed to explain the relation of causation between tem porarily separated events. If there is no ontological survival, there could be no simple set of laws connecting the two events. Rather there would be an infinite set of laws, each set being derived respectively from the actuality existing at each moment between the two events. But such an explanation entirely belies the nature of law as we know it. For there to be any real con nection between temporally separate events in this scheme there would have to be a Superlaw relating the various instantaneous laws. But this Superlaw would not be immanent in anything; it would transcend both the instantaneous laws and the sensual being from which the instantaneous laws are derived. But in this case, we have returned to the doctrine of law as transcendent, which we saw above is invalid. The second reason why this argu ment is inapplicable is that Being-at-an-Instant is nothing real, it is a mere abstraction. I shall try to show this later in the paper. It is evident, however, that if there is no actuality at a temporal point, then for law to be immanent, it must be im manent in beings which endure through a finite extent of time. The ontological survival of these beings provides, according to our definition, the material cause. It is interesting to observe that modern physics seems to be turning to the concept of Immanent Law in a way that stresses the material cause. In Newtonian mechanics the gravitational force exerted by one body on another could not be explained by examining the structure of the constituents in gravitation?i. e. the bodies themselves and the space in which they are located. Hence Newton had to postulate a mysterious 'force' which acted between the bodies, and which was applied, ultimately, through the agency of a transcendent God. In general relativity, the</page><page sequence="12">Ontological Examination of Causation 63 notion of force is rejected as extraneous. Instead, the presence of bodies modifies ('curves') their intermediating space, and con versely the geometry of the space determines the geodesic on which the bodies move. The law of gravitation as thus restated is nothing but an expression of qualities and mutual modifica tions in the bodies and in the space, all of which are surviving entities underlying the expression of the law. Why the space and the bodies should modify each other in the way they do is an even profounder question. Physics, not seeking the ultimacy that ontology demands, has not provided the answer. It has indicated the answer partially by rediscovering the principle of the material cause. Until physics finds some way of dealing precisely with teleology, it will remain incapable of giving a complete account of why bodies affect each other as they do. And when it learns to deal with teleology physics will have passed into metaphysics anyway. But we are going astray, for the role of the final cause is beyond the scope of this paper as well as beyond the scope of physics. ?3. In the first part of this paper I have tried to demonstrate that the material cause is a fundamental component in any causal nexus. I have argued that understanding of the role of the material cause will explain in large measure four aspects of causation: that is, the causal relation between physical events, the causal relation between mental events, causal Law, and the 'activity' of causation. Since part 1. was largely expository, how ever, I slurred over several powerful considerations against the material cause. I shall here present these and try to indicate a reply to them. The first criticism is that the material cause cannot explain what is essential in the causal process. As Bradley says in Appear ance and Reality, cause is "an attempt to account rationally for change." But the material cause is nothing but ontological sur vival, so it accounts for nothing but permanence and persistence. The ideal cosmology for formulating the notion of the material cause, this criticism would state, is materialistic atomism. For in such a system there is complete survival through eternity of the ultimate particles of the universe. Hence it would seem that the</page><page sequence="13">64 Abner Shimony material cause has a splendid opportunity to display its power in explaining causation. But this is precisely what it cannot do in a materialistic atomist cosmology, because the substantial and enduring atoms are indifferent to change in position. Change in position is completely external to the atoms, so that such change cannot be explained by examining the private natures of the atoms themselves. But if we do not explain the shifts in configurations of the atoms, we cannot explain the causal con nection between events in this materialistic cosmology. Hence the material cause is practically irrelevant to the nature of causation. A second criticism is that explaining causation by invoking the material cause is begging the question. For we are forced to ask how there can be any ontological survival at all. The past as actuality is dead. The connection between the past and the present is maintained only indirectly by surviving entities. But how can these entities survive unless there is already a mode which the past survives in the present? Are not Descartes and Whitehead correct in saying that the world must be created afresh at every instant, in which case beings at two different moments can not be the same, but can at best only resemble each other? These are both extremely powerful criticisms. I can give only a partial answer to them, though I believe a complete answer is possible if we reckon with the final cause. The partial answer that I would give to both criticisms de pends on a single consideration: that ontological survival of beings does not mean the persistence of rigid unchanging enti ties. All being is meaningless apart from its activity (though I would also say that Being transcends its activity; it is that which is active, rather than sheer process.) Now if activity is of the essence of things, then it can only be accidental that some things seem to persist without any qualitative or spatial change. Tra ditional philosophy, influenced at this point chiefly by Descartes, was mistaken in taking stable inanimate objects as the conceptual model of substance. A much better model is the organism, which imposes a constant self over radically differing manifestation in time. Inanimate things seem substantial in the older sense, not because they somehow project temporally the harmony and</page><page sequence="14">Ontological Examination of Causation 65 self-identity of Being-at-an-Instant, but because they fail to assert themselves by sufficiently vigorous activity. The self-Identity of Being-at-an-Instant is a false ideal in conceiving substance. For Being-at-an-Instance is a mere abstrac tion, and not the most intense of actualities. The following dia lecte argument should show there is no being at a temporal point, so that activity through time is a fundamental definiens of being. There are three fundamental modes in which an actuality exists in the universe. They are temporal, spatial and qualitative. No existent can fail to manifest itself in all three ways. If a sup posed actuality did not exist qualitatively it would not posses self-identity, and would hence be nothing. If a supposed actuality did not manifest itself in the spatio-temporal realm, it would be nothing but ideal content, disembodied and merely potentially existent. But Being-at-an-Instant appears in none of these three modes of existence! It is non-temporal by hypothesis, since it occupies only a temporal point and not an extent of time. Hence it is outside time, because there is nothing in an isolated tempo ral point that either distinguishes it from or connects it with the rest of time. A temporal point is timeless. Being-at-an-Instant is non-spatial, because it cannot exhibit either of the two ways in which things are in space?motion and extent. It is not in motion because motion takes time; the physicist's expression of velocity at an instant by a first derivative in the calculus is only a con venient fiction. But, extension also requires time. To say that a body is extended is to assert that its parts have so influenced each other, or that the whole has so dominated its parts, that the body resists crumbling into mere points. But influence and domination are modes of behavior that require a temporal span. I should not be in the least troubled if I were under the absolute dominion of Satan only for a single instant, since there would be no time for any evil consequences; or to speak more precisely, there would not have been any dominion whatsoever. Hence Being-at-an-Instant is non-spatial. And finally it is not qualitative ly existent. Obviously it hasn't such attributes as life or health, for these are meaningful only of things in process. But can it even possess those qualities which common-sense considers non temporal? For a thing prossesses no quality that we can name without taking a finite stretch of time to establish the patterns</page><page sequence="15">66 Abner Shimony determining that quality. Can a thing be colored except in an interval sufficiently long to allow at least one complete electro magnetic vibration of the requisite wave-length? We might say that the structure and chemical properties which allow the body to absorb light of all wavelengths except this particular one does exist at a temporal point. But this power of absorption is only a potentiality, which is not actualized until it has reflected a whole wave-length. There might be potential being at a temporal point; but Being-at-an-Instant cannot be actual. It seems then that Being-at-an-Instant fails to manifest any of the three fundamental modes of existence. The most we can say about it, is that it is spatio-temporal point, possessing no determinate character. Any character we assign to it is given by abstraction out of process, just as the physicist abstracts instantaneous velocity. We must agree with Whitehead that "there is no nature at an instant." My answers to the two criticisms of the material cause follow as corollaries from this analysis of Being-at-an-Instant. Beings survive through time, because if they did not they would not exist. Or, to state our result in a different way, time itself does not pass as a continuous string of temporal points, for then it would be a sum of nothings. Rather the present is a finite extent of time which is divisible only virtually, not actually. So that a Being must persist at least through this minimum stretch, even if it does not last through a sequence of presents. This answers the second criticism. The first criticism is at least partially answered, because the beings which do survive are not rigidly unchanging things. As substances they are characterized by activity and flux, so that they not only account for the similarity between events, but also for the difference between them. Hence "like must cause like" is at best a half-truth. Why the activity of a substantial being assumes the particular pattern that it does is a more profound problem, and until it is answered we have not satisfactorily replied to the first criticism. The answer de pends, I believe, on the relation of the nexus of future possibili ties to the present actuality. But I cannot deal with this relation without launching the whole problem of teleology. So far I have been non-partisan in this paper on the problem of determinism. I believe the material cause is significant whether the future is completely contained within the past or whether</page><page sequence="16">Ontological Examination of Causation 67 thefuture unfolds in genuinely novel ways. Until the nature of time and of creativity is examined I do not think that we can make any definitive statement on the problem of determinism. But I wish to note a few ways in which this discussion of the material cause might be applied to the problem of determinism. Ducasse* and Joseph** employ an argument for determin ism which seems to be greatly strengthened by considering the material cause. Neither presents this argument with great clarity. It may be stated as follows: if a being survives through time, then it must be a single entity and hence must satisfy the Law of Identity. The Law of Identity asserts, to use the Leibnizean definition, that x equals y if and only if x possesses a property A when and only when y possesses that property: x=y:=(f)f(x)=f(y) Now let the propositional schema f be replaced by the pro positional function h, where h (z) means "the future behavior of z is R." Then x=y implies that h (x)=h (y), that is, that if the future behavior of x is R, the future behavior of y will also be R, and conversely. Now it is a tautology that x=x, that a thing has all the attributes that it does in fact have. Substituting the true proposition x=x for the proposition x=y in our formula, we get the result that "if the future behavior of x is R, then the future behavior of x is R." This means that if the law of identity is to hold of a thing, as it certainly does, then of two discrepant proposals concerning the future behavior of the thing, only one can hold. A being, therefore, cannot contain a multitude of alternative possibilities of its future without splitting its own identity. There is a specious attractiveness about this use of onto logical survival to prove that absolute determinism holds. But all this argument says is that a single entity has only a single history, which is not very revealing. It says that when the future of that entity has become actualized, there will be but one pos sible course of action for that entity, the one that it will be undergoing. But it does not say that the future possibilities of that entity, considered from the standpoint of the actual present # Ducasse, "Causation and Types of Necessity,'* p. 64. ** Joseph, "Principles of Logic", p. 378.</page><page sequence="17">68 Abner Shimony rather than of the future present, are limited to one. The law of identity will be satisfied as long as one of the present possibilities is fulfilled, and no more than one. Possibilities conflict only when actualized. If the law of identity were applied to possibilities of future behavior rather than to the future behavior as actualized, we should have to state that a single entity can have one and only one complete set of potentialities. If the argument proposed by Ducasse and Joseph applied to possibilities, why would it not also apply to qualities? We would then say that, because of the principles of identity, a being can have only one quality. The argument is fallacious because qualities are such that they may subsist in an entity as a set of complements. Material causation also supplies an argument against com plete determinism. As we saw above, ontological survival implies that natural law is immanent in being. But if law is derivative from being, and being is always active, how can we be sure that the laws themselves remain constant. Whitehead argues that if law is immanent it must therefore be changing:* "Since the laws of nature depend on the individual characters of the things constituting nature, as the things change, then correspondingly the laws will change. Thus the modern evolutionary view of the physical universe should conceive of the laws of nature as evolv ing concurrently with the things constituting the environment." Whitehead's statement, I believe, oversimplifies the case. It may be that physical law is precisely that which is generic and fixed in all change, the component of beings that acts as an internal unmoved mover. My own view is that this is not the case, and that law actually does evolve. I think this is shown by the fact that as inanimate matter evolves into organisms, there seems to be a concurrent evolution of physical into biological law. But this problem awaits an examination of the nature of evolution and of creativity. Abner Shimony Memphis, Tenn. * "Adventures of Ideas", p. 143.</page></plain_text>
