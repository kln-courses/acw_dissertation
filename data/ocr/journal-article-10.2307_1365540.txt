The publication of this volume brings to a close an ambitious project that has spanned the last seventeen years. During this period the work pro- ceeded only as time was available from the many official duties of both writers with the Fish and Wildlife Service, and, more recently in the case of Dr. Gabrielson, with the Wildlife Management Institute. The rather extensive field experience of the senior author in Alaska, and the competence in the taxonomy of North American birds on the part of both authors, well qualified these men for this undertaking. Additionally, their intensive scrutiny of the scattered literature on birds of this area has resulted in a 55-page bibliography. The result is a much-needed and useful book. Quite understandably, the greater part of the book, and its major contribution, is comprised of accounts of the 321 species and 414 subspecies the authors recognize as Alaskan birds. The wealth of information found here is arranged, in general, under the following headings: (1) scientific and vernacular names; (2) native names; (3) descrip- tion; (4) general range; (5) range in Alaska; and (6) haunts and habits. The nomenclature follows for the most part that of the Fifth Edition of the A.O.U. Check- list, although vernacular names are supplied for subspecies. Where only one race of a species is present in Alaska no vernacular name for the species is given. This will surely lead to some confusion, especially among less experienced stu- dents, and certainly makes use of the book more difficult. Notable departures from check-list no- menclature, other than in spelling, are few, of which the following are examples: the designa- tion of the Green-winged Teal as a subspecies, carolinensis, of Anas crecca; inclusion of the Ruddy Turnstones, confusingly referred to as European Turnstone, in the race morinella, not interpres; and the placing of the Bank Swallows in the race maximiliani (consistently misspelled with two l's) rather than riparia. Particularly puzzling is the referral of the Alaskan Gray Jays to the race arcus. This name was proposed for jays inhabiting the Rainbow Mountains of coastal British Columbia when it was revealed that the former name pacificus should be applied, through priority, to the birds in western Alaska. The races kadiaka, for the Rosy Finches of Kodiak Island, and crassus, for the Savannah Sparrows in south- eastern Alaska, are recognized. The Lincoln Spar- rows of Alaska, Yukon Territory, and the Mac- kenzie Valley are considered to be the race alticola, not lincolnii. Some of these changes seem very tentative and should be verified by further work. The native names may prove useful for field workers, but some confusion will result from the fact they are variously allocated to dialect, local- ity, or both, or merely "Eskimo." The Innuit dia- lect is incorrectly indicated as being spoken at Hooper Bay in western Alaska; actually it is spoken north of Norton Sound. The variation in native names, even between nearby localities, plus the difficulty of pronunciation, makes one wonder whether these are of real value to ornithologists. The descriptions are taken from such sources as Bent's life histories, Chapman's handbook of eastern birds, Bailey's handbook of western birds, and numerous others. Included is length (casually given in inches), and a discussion of the plumages of downy young, immatures, and adults. These descriptions are often laboriously detailed and far exceed information necessary or pertinent for identification. Much space is devoted to unneces- sarily detailed accounts of species known only as accidentals or casuals in the state. Notes on nest and eggs are also included in this section. The statements on general range have been con- densed from the Fifth Edition of the A.O.U. Check-list, while those on range in Alaska have been derived from such sources as the files of the Fish and Wildlife Service, the unpublished rec- ords of a host of observers, and the literature. Each record is cited to the original source or, when unpublished, to the observer. This extreme- ly valuable and well documented compilation, the most outstanding single feature of the book,</page><page sequence="2">230 THE CONDOR Vol.61 brings together for the first time many previously unavailable records. The notes of the senior author, Bent's life his- tories, and other sources, have been extensively utilized in drawing up the miscellany of natural history information under the title "Haunts and Habits." Important details on song, relative abundance, nesting, food, territorial behavior, and flight are presented. Others, such as accounts of nest and eggs, and remarks on plumage, are need- less repetitions of material found under "Descrip- tion." Many of these accounts are written in a tiresome anthropomorphic fashion unlikely to ap- peal to the professional ornithologist, or to the general reader, and certainly they are not in keep- ing with the scientific nature of the book. In the opinion of this reviewer the species ac- counts suffer most when they deal with those polytypic species represented by several races in Alaska. In some instances both general range and range in Alaska are discussed under the race in question. For others, only general range is men- tioned here, and the range in Alaska is given as a unit for the group of races being considered. In the latter instance each race may be introduced in any one of six or seven ways, making necessary a search to pinpoint the form being discussed. Fi- nally, the headings "General Range" and "Range in Alaska" may both be replaced by simply "Range" when this is only in Alaska. This was done for the Winter Wrens, in part for the Song Sparrows, but not at all for the Fox Sparrows. The book is poorly illustrated. The absence of range maps, particularly weakening the treatment of geographically variable species, will be noted by many as a grievous omission. There are no photographs, and only one small map for use with the gazetteer. The 13 color plates, scattered in- discriminately through the text, are, in general, of poor quality. The introductory chapters cover a variety of subjects, such as history, migration, ecological zones, and introductions. The 29-page section on history, easily one of the better chapters in the book, carefully traces the activities and contribu- tions of nearly all the ornithologists who have worked in Alaska during the periods of Russian and American exploration and the recent period beginning about 1900. Included as "Some Inter- esting Aspects of Alaskan Ornithology" are topics such as numbers of species and subspecies present, an interesting comparison of numbers of land and water birds, regular migrants not known to breed in Alaska, casual or accidental species, summer and winter residents, and remarks on such strikingly variable species as Winter Wrens, and Fox and Song sparrows. Many readers will take issue with loose statements such as the one expressing the view that all the breeding birds are boreal species. While the avifauna is distinctly boreal, it does not follow that all the species and subspecies of which it is comprised are also boreal. Acanthis flammea holboelli is regarded as the single land bird known only as a migrant in Alaska, although this race is currently regarded by the A.O.U. Committee on Nomenclature as breeding across the northern part of the state, and no real evidence to the contrary is presented. The remarks attributing intraspecific variation in Winter Wrens and Sa- vannah, Fox, and Song sparrows to fortuitous combinations, environmental factors, and isola- tion due to absence of suitable habitat seem to be a rather oversimplified attempt to explain com- plicated phenomena. The chief discussion on mi- gration, primarily concerned with defining routes, is of necessity quite speculative, and points up the need for detailed studies involving banding, col- lecting at critical stations, and coordinated ob- servation. The discussion of major ecological units in Alaska, together with brief statements on those species of birds characteristic of these units, is developed around the life-zone and faunal district concepts of Merriam and Nelson, respectively. Merriam's system includes all of Alaska in the Arctic-Alpine (tundra and montane), Hudsonian (interior spruce-birch forest), and Canadian (coastal forest) life-zones. These coincide with the faunal districts, although Nelson also places emphasis on the distinctiveness of the Aleutian area from the standpoint of both vegetation and avifauna. Other major systems of ecological clas- sification, as well as climate or climatic gradients, are not discussed, and no attempt is made at an ecological or faunal analysis. The inclusion of a map indicating the distribution of the major vegetation types would have greatly enhanced this section. The lists of vernacular names used in the in- troductory chapters do not always agree with those used in the species accounts. Names for species and subspecies (for example, Lapland Longspur, p. 45, and Alaska Longspur, p. 48) are used interchangeably. Some names such as Lap- land Longspur, Olive-backed Thrush, Lutescent Warbler, and others never appear again in the book. The closing sections include a hypothetical list</page><page sequence="3">May, 1959 NOTES AND NEWS 231 of birds reported from Alaska but not represented by specimens. It is indicated that only four species were included in the state list on the basis of sight records alone. A helpful gazetteer is provided. The book is refreshingly free of typographical errors, and only one of the few noticed, the mis- spelling of "grosbeaks" (p. 744) is conspicuous. This is the first comprehensive report dealing with the birds of all of Alaska, and as such aids in filling a gap in our knowledge of the ornithol- ogy of a vast section of North America. The book also serves to bring into focus the relationship between Alaska's avifauna and the avifaunas of the circumpolar tundra and coniferous forest bi- omes and the boreal avifauna of this continent, although this is not discussed in detail or partic- ularly emphasized. Ornithologists generally, and those with an interest in boreal regions particu- larly, will welcome this new and valuable refer- ence book. It will long remain the definitive work on Alaskan birds.-FRANCIS S. L. WILLIAMSON.</page></plain_text>
