<plain_text><page sequence="1">What Can Man Believe In? 7 What Can Man Believe In? CHARLES A. CURRAN To answer the question simply, I would propose that man can believe in three things: himself, others, and God. To delineate the meaning of such an answer, however, involves us in a discussion, first of all, of what we mean by "belief." How is faith different from a process of knowing or of reasoning or proving? The answer also involves us in defining how one believes in oneself, how one believes in others, and how, through the self and others, one can believe in God. Faith as unconditional commitment We need to begin with what is meant by "belief." Here, as a result of a common confusion perhaps attributable to the religious biblical empha sis of the sixteenth century, the extenuation of printing, and the resul tant focus on the written and printed word, belief has come to mean for many an expression of some kind of creed or document or some list of The Rev. Charles A. Curran, ph.d., Professor of Psychology at Loyola University, Chicago, has devoted years of research and study to counseling, psychotherapy, and learning and has written articles and books on these subjects.

We cannot, of course, disregard the importance of a list of propositions or creedal statements, because these in some measure struc ture propositionally the nature of belief. Yet this view of belief is, in it self, also misleading. What we mean by faith is rather that which is both a prelude and a concomitant of hope and love. Faith, in this sense, has to do with persons, not with verbal, creedal statements or documents. Faith is an abandonment of the self and a commitment of the self. This has been expressed in a modern way as an unconditional, positive regard both of the ego toward the self and of the ego-self toward others. For faith to be operational and real, it must be positive and unconditional. One has no faith in another person if one is negative toward that per son; nor does one have faith in another person if one sets up a series of restrictive conditions determining whether one trusts and hopes in the other person. These kinds of restrictions, conditions, and negations vitiate at its inception the nature of a genuine personal commitment, a true faith and trust in another. What could be said of the commitment toward others in uncondi tioned positive regard can also be said of the self. The ego must in some very real way have an unconditioned positive regard toward its own self. A man who gives in to negativism toward himself and sets up a series of hypothetical propositions around any kind of positive regard toward himself is a man caught in his own masochistic death-wish instinct. Perhaps this helps explain the constant recurrence of the na?ve notion of a positive self-attitude, such as Dr. Cou?'s famous "Day by day I am get ting better and better" of fifty years ago and many more recent positive motivation concepts. Simple as they may appear, they have in them this need for a conscious positive self-attitude, and so such ideas keep recur ring. They help a person, giving him a simple motivational formula that aids him to hold a positive regard toward himself. This is the es sence of faith in oneself. The notion of self-confidence is made up of the Latin notion of faith in oneself. The confident man, believing in him self, is characterized by this unconditioned, positive attitude toward himself.</page><page sequence="3">What Can Man Believe In? 9 Proof as the exclusion of love It is in this sense that we are talking about faith. While propositional statements and, in a religious context, creedal statements must be made, they are secondary to the personal leap that Kierkegaard made famous. Such a commitment is necessary if there is to be any genuine hope and love of the self and others and, through others, of God. We cannot ap proach ourselves negatively, hemmed in with a series of conditions around which we accept ourselves; nor can we approach others or God in this way. The mystics always understood this in their concept of the abandonment of the self to God. The most fundamental aspect of faith is a commitment without restriction. In this way it leads to hope and, in a very special way, to love. We can see the negative attitude implied in restrictions and conditions, or even in an excessive reasonableness in demanding "proof," if we con sider two scenes with which a modern play, television episode, or movie might begin. In a given scene the clues quickly indicate that the wife wants proof of her husband's whereabouts when he was two hours late for dinner, as well as exact evidence that he is telling the truth. From one point of view, this could be called a scientific or reasonable attitude. The husband should be willing to offer proof of where he was and why he was late. Yet intuitively and without explanation the audience, even the least sophisticated among them, immediately sense that there is com paratively little love existing between these two people. If so much proof is demanded when any element of mystery occurs in their relationship, they cannot really trust or love one another. Conversely, if the opening scene has the woman dismissing the hus band's being late as understandable without explanation, in a trusting and secure acceptance of his having good reasons without his needing to give them, the same audience quickly understands that love exists be tween the two. The more one demands reasons and explanations, the less the atmosphere of trust and love is conveyed. The more conditions seem to demand proof, the less will love be evident. Contrariwise, love is re</page><page sequence="4">10 Journal of Religion and Health vealed when open and simple acceptance occurs with no proof de manded. Love, with its concomitant trust, is a genuine affirmation in the face of the unknown and the mysterious. Faith as the finding of the self Faith is itself, therefore, an act of giving oneself to oneself, to others, and among those others, religious faith implies a special leap and gift of oneself to God. The act of faith must proceed from a willingness both to possess the self and at the same time to give the self. Here we are in a strange paradox, something of which popular language expresses. We talk about "finding" oneself, "being" oneself, and "believing in one self." How can I, if I am lost, find myself? And who is lost and who is found? Or how can I, being myself, not believe in myself? How can I, in a sense, cut myself off from myself and not believe in myself? What we are attempting to discuss here is made difficult because lan guage, especially popular language, while very rich in subtle if con fused awarenesses, is also confusing in the various ways it phrases these observed divisions in the self. The place of the "ego," the "self," the "whole person" often gets quite mixed up in this confused terminology. We say, for example, that a person is "going to pieces," that he should "take hold of himself" and "pull himself together," and everyone knows or feels, in general and in feeling-tone, what we mean. But what, pre cisely, does this mean? This we will attempt to discuss without, how ever, entirely resolving the confusion in these popular expressions. This act of the ego making the self the object of its belief or disbelief, while it appears to be contradictory, is, at the same time, a human ex perience. Such an apparent paradox is possible. We know from personal awareness and experience of belief in the self that one can have confi dence in oneself, and so make a far better use of himself by such aban doning of the self or his ego to himself. Failure to do this negates and divides the self. Prior to this belief in oneself is the placing of value on the self. I can</page><page sequence="5">What Can Man Believe In? 11 say, in a kind of dichotomous language that is yet understood by anyone hearing me, because he shares the same awareness, that "I am disgusted with myself," or even that "I hate myself." In this situation where the ego is in a negative, resistant attitude toward the self, one can see that no genuine faith or trust in the self is possible. Insofar as I give myself genuinely to myself, I do so first of all by valuing myself, by having a deep sense of my worth as a self. So, prior to any gift of myself to myself or prior to any confidence in myself or faith in myself, there must be the statement that "I respect myself," that "I have positive regard for my self," that "I think myself to have genuine significance and worth." I must, in a word, assume a "redemptive" attitude toward myself in order to believe in myself. By "redemptive" here we mean that I must convey worth and value on myself so that I feel myself worthy to be the recipient of the gift of the "I" believing in and giving myself over to myself. If I believe a gift to be of no value, then its reception is valueless. In answering the question of what man can believe in, then, an im portant issue is to define what belief is. "By "belief" we do not mean some list of documents or some intellectually convincing propositions. It is a commitment and a belief in someone. But before we can even talk about the "other," we first have to consider the self: do I believe in my self and am I in possession of myself sufficiently to give myself to my self? If I have this positive, redeeming attitude toward myself, I am in a position to give myself to others. In this sense, faith is intimately re lated to hope and love. Necessity of an integrated self One might raise the further issue about the obvious dichotomy in the self contained in phrases like "one must possess the self," or even that "one hates oneself and one must love oneself." These segmented phrases of the self seem to leave the ego incomplete. One reason for this tendency of self-segmentation is inherited through our culture, which has given us a Cartesian-Kantian idea of the psyche or the self, namely, that it is</page><page sequence="6">12 Journal of Religion and Health highly intellectual and fundamentally voluntarist. If we focus on the Kantian sense of duty, which primarily determined the will and the categorical imperative that directed it, we recognize that Kant, like Des cartes, saw no place for the emotions, the instincts, and the soma as re lated to the psyche and, therefore, as part of the human person. The body was cut off and removed, and this separation justified the current mech anistic notions of the time at which both Kant and Descartes lived. If we look now, however, at the unity of the self, we recognize that we are per haps more comfortable with the Aristotelian notion of the psyche or the self as "informing" the soma and being its basic life principle. The point here would be that the acts of both knowing and willing in the self would seek to penetrate into the emotions, instincts, and soma. This involves the struggle to gain self-insight and greater integrated control of the self in much the manner that modern psychotherapy and counsel ing have worked out and described. Looked at this way, the process of possessing the self, of loving the self, or of finding the self would be a process of taking counsel with the self. It would involve a penetrating into the significance and meaning behind the segmented urges of the emotions, instincts, and soma and a recognizing of the particular seg mented purpose of each of these actions. In this way, one would slowly pull them together into some kind of organismic wisdom. In a particu lar evaluation and decision, such wisdom integrates what is best in the soma, emotions, and instincts in the direction of what seems, in terms of personal insight and past and present self-awareness, to be best for the total integrated self. In other words, before faith in the self can really occur and, therefore, before hope and love in self can really occur, one must avoid, in Plato's term, the "tragedy of the unexamined life." One must undergo con stant taking counsel with the self in order that, in a particular experi ence, evaluation, or choice, he can take the best elements of his aware ness of the self, somatically, emotionally, and instinctively, and co-or dinate them with what seems best to the intellectualized and voluntary aspects of the self. In this sense, there is a kind of owning up to the self.</page><page sequence="7">What Can Man Believe In? 13 Usually in children and often in adults, there is an unwillingness to ac cept the body as being part of the self, as in the expression "my feet are killing me." Here one gives a negative intent to parts of the body as being against the self. The same can be true of the instincts and the emotions. They can be seen as inimical to the self. In "owning up to the self" or the self possessing its total self, we have a self-insightful process that seeks the integrity of all aspects of the self?soma, instincts, emotions, intellect, and voluntary functions. This process believes in an integrated wisdom that, with the soma, instincts, and emotions co-ordinated in the best sense of self-realization, work to gether toward the good of the whole person. It is this kind of uncon ditioned, positive belief in the self that the counseling-therapeutic pro cess brings about when it is successful. "Belief in the self" becomes clearer when we get away from the Car tesian-Kantian dichotomized notion of the separation of the psyche and soma. What we see is rather a process of integration brought about through taking counsel with the self from which follows personal evalu ation of what is best for the whole person and choices that integrate soma, instincts, and emotions to intellect and will. Belief in oneself would mean that one can integrate the psyche and the soma in such a way that they interact harmoniously with one another rather than necessarily being at odds with one another in the Cartesian sense. Counsel: the informing of the self There must be a period, then, in which the person takes counsel with himself, and this taking counsel is a kind of "informing" the self. It is a real "informational" relation with the self in the basic sense of inform ing the whole self and encapsulating or integrating it with the insight ful awarenesses of the cognitive self as it strives to understand and pene trate and "in-form" the emotions, instincts, and soma. In this sense, we would be talking in a quite different context about the notion of "believing that I may understand." By this idea of belief</page><page sequence="8">14 Journal of Religion and Health we mean the positive regard one has toward the whole self; that one re spectfully approaches the soma, instincts, and emotions to seek the rea sons mysteriously hidden in their apparently segmented motivation; that by approaching them in this way one begins to understand and then can integrate them with the awarenesses of the ego in the conscious intellectual and voluntarist aspects of the self. This concept of "in-forming" or integrating the whole person is often difficult for us because, as we said, our culture is still so caught up in a dichotomized inheritance from both the Cartesianism and Kantianism of an intellectual and voluntary process completely removed from, or at least separated from, the rather automatic mechanistic soma. Even while we use words that speak of a unified person, we are perhaps still cul turally handicapped and impaired. This is because it is hard for us to feel a respectful regard for the possible unity of the soma, instincts, and emotions as having reasons that could be integrated and co-ordinated with the conscious, cognitive will. The self related to others We might go into a further analysis of why "faith in the self" or total positive commitment to the whole person is so difficult. But we can move on now to consider the aspect of the self that relates us to others and in the capital sense to the final Other, God. We are restating in another form a contention of Aristotle that friendly relations with others or, in our terms, unconditional, positive regard toward others begins with a genuine friendship toward the self. This positive regard or "faith in the self" initiates the subtle process of integration of the self in con trast to the dichotomized aspects of the self. This makes possible the faith, hope, and love that emerge between ego and the whole self. Through this process, too, the integrated self can begin both to give it self in faith to others and to trust, hope in, and love others. Consequent ly, the focus on our relationship to others is rather predetermined by how we work out our relationship to ourselves. Stated another way, a</page><page sequence="9">What Can Man Believe In? 15 man must be a true friend to himself before he can be a friend to others. Somewhat like dark glasses, our attitude toward ourselves colors our re gard for and view of others. Aquinas extends this notion further by making the interpretation of the text, so well known in Christian tradition, that one must love one's neighbor as oneself, and then in and through love of neighbor and one self, one must love God. Aquinas comments that in this text the love of self is the model of which the love of neighbor is the copy, and that the copy will only be as valid, sound, and operationally effective as the model. In other words, as we love or hate ourselves, so our relation to others will be a copy of this. He proposes that we must learn to "love ourselves loving" rather than "love ourselves hating." These awarenesses all lead to the realization that our relationship to others, and as a basic other, our relationship to God, is in some way fundamentally determined by the way we believe, hope in, and love our selves. This is the reason why we have put so much emphasis on the subtlety of the ego related to the whole self as being fundamental to how the self relates to others and to God. The focal point here is that the self relates to others and to God in great measure as it relates to its total self. The nature of one's "belief" in others, therefore, follows from one's "be lief," or lack of it, in oneself?that is, one's whole, unified, psychoso matic person. The ability to believe in others is determined by how well one relates to himself, to what extent he believes in himself, loves him self, and has confidence in himself. The ambiguity in "insight" Here a word should be said of the ambiguity that is implied in the use of the word "insight" itself. In the intellectual Cartesian focus that, in large measure, our scientific culture and its model of mathematics also inherit, insight would mean the gestalt configuration of coming togeth er, not unlike the pieces of the jigsaw puzzle coming together at a mo ment to represent the face of Lincoln, or, more exactly, the mathematical</page><page sequence="10">16 Journal of Religion and Health model of the way numbers or equations are calculated or factored out. This kind of abstractive, ideational configuration has an intellectualized existence that removes us from any engagement with the complexities of the whole self; that is, the much less ordered and co-ordinated soma, instincts, and emotions as they influence the self. Consequently this kind of abstractive and reflective harmony and integration of ideas, while valid as an orderly schema of life and the universe in its abstractive con figurations, can in fact represent an escape and even a false clarity for the kind of insightful knowing that leads to the ego making a positive com mitment to the whole integrated person. If, for example, in the Cartesian model (the first rule of the "Discours de la m?thode/' according to which truth must be so "clear and distinct that it can no wise be doubted"? drawn from the clarity and conviction of mathematics) we were to look at the kind of struggle of insightful awareness of the self, then certainly we would never emerge with anything so clear and so distinct as to be even remotely comparable to the precision and integration of a mathe matical configuration. What we mean, therefore, by "insight" is not this kind of abstractive, gestaltist configuration on the mathematical model. We mean rather the painful struggle necessary in the mystery of the self in order to come up with those awarenesses, confused as they may be, that are yet filled with subtle significance to the self. "Insight" means the slow integration of particular somatic, instinctive, or emotional elements with the broader cognitive awarenesses of the self. What we are focused on here is this more difficult, personal, and pain ful insight into oneself, rather than an abstractive pulling the pieces to gether "out there." This kind of insight into one's whole self is what is essential for the regard, respect, and love of the self. The insight that we are talking about would be creative with regard to the whole self. In other words, this kind of insight would gradually bring about a new self. This self has all sorts of parallels and resonances with the Christian birth of new self, particularly in its Pauline emphasis. Carl Rogers has spoken of the fundamental reasonableness he finds in</page><page sequence="11">What Can Man Believe In? 17 his clients when he genuinely strives to understand them. What I think he means here is that soma, instincts, and emotions have a basic reasonable ness in what they do?a kind of reason for being and acting. Unfortu nately, this reasonableness is narrow and restricted to the immediate somatic, instinctive, or emotional need?like the swelling of the nose in vasomotor rhinitis or the defensive eye blink. It sometimes corresponds to the need of the whole person. Most often, however, it can impede or even frustrate the whole person's fulfillment. It is the whole self's strug gle for "insight" into the self that pulls these conflicting, narrow reasons together and integrates with the needs of the whole person. In carrying further, then, the issue of the self and why we must strug gle for this kind of insight into the mystery of the whole self, one comes to a prior concept of some "disintegration" in man. Many traditions have attempted to explain these apparent divisions in the self by pro posing that, because of some primal fault or fundamental error in the human condition, man has no longer the kind of integration that he might normally have had, or that he might be thought ideally to have. According to some traditions, this disintegrated state is a less natural, in the sense of less ideal, state of the human condition and so might be con ceived of as a punishment. There are, however, other ways of looking at this same situation. They do not disregard the concept of disintegration, but rather suggest other aspects that could help to extend and clarify it. The anxiety of existence Any discussion of the dichotomy, conflict, partitions, segmentations, or divisions within the self tends to focus, as a result of influences from Kierkegaard through Freud to modern Existentialism, on the angst of the human condition. Somehow man experiences from the first moment of existence?Freud proposes that anxiety seems to be a given and cannot be explained by anything prior to the infant or child's existence?a state of anxious concern and threat around both his own existence and the meaning and ultimate value of that existence. However we explain this</page><page sequence="12">18 Journal of Religion and Health angst of man, it follows that it leaves him with a great fear of any kind of risk or any sort of engaging himself in the unknown. In this sense, the Scriptural text that "perfect love casts out fear" would give the dichotomy here. What faith, hope, and love have to work against is the basic fear in man that causes him to shrivel up in his own ego and so renders him unwilling to trust or to give himself in any kind of openness, even to those other aspects of himself that would complete his integration. So the man who "hates himself" or is negative toward himself is also a man who is afraid of himself and afraid to trust him self. It becomes evident that this same kind of fear of the self and fear to trust the self will be radiated to others, and in a religious context, to the Supreme Other, thus resulting in the same kind of anxious unwilling ness to commit oneself. In this context it is intriguing that this is really the issue in the Parable of the Talents. While we popularly interpret the parable as an intellectualist search for talents and the obligation of the more talented one, the core of the parable was this very shriveling, self-inverting, narcissistic fear. This caused the man with the one talent to bury it and not to risk, in fear and anxiety of the master, any com mitment of himself or the talent, but rather only to encrust himself, pro tect himself, and hold on. Here, as in the text, "He that would save his life shall lose it," such self-invested anxious protection of the ego against a total commitment to the self and others is the very opposite of the act that would cast out fear and move in the direction of love, and, therefore, also of hope and faith. We are speaking, then, of man's faith in himself, others, and God and of his attempt to overcome the primal angst that seems to characterize the human condition. This involves a man's confidence in himself and his capacity to work against the primitive defense of the self and so to ar rive at some kind of leap, abandonment, or going out that accompanies the gift of the self to others. This struggle is common to the human condition and not peculiar to any of us. It is a struggle against a narrowness and a closing-in on our selves that would be the opposite of going out, of broadening ourselves,</page><page sequence="13">What Can Man Believe In? 19 and so opening up to others. The fundamental angst of the human con dition militates against man's being able to go out and take the risk of giving himself to another person in love and faith. There is something self-defeating in this, as we observe in the illustration of the man who had the one talent. The thing that he needs most he has the least chance of getting. This is a characteristic result of the angst of the human con dition. It cannot be described in any other way than as an almost blind fear, a fear of losing existence and the narrow and often self-defeating need to hang on to it primitively. The drowning man's grabbing at the rescuer's throat may suggest something of this primitive, blind, self defeating panic. Integration from change in perception If we follow this self-defeating condition and fear of commitment or of going out, this angst, we notice in the German itself?which suggests being "cornered"?that such a condition is narrow and constrictive, that fear and anxiety create narrow and constrictive feelings. We find this if we pursue the thought further in the way it is revealed in the pro cess of taking counsel with the self and gaining insight into the mysteri ous aspects of man. If we look at the meaning of such angst, or such narrowed constriction in the self, we find that in the emotion of fear, in the instinct of defense, and in the primitive somatic reactions?for ex ample such as vasomotor rhinitis where the areas swell up to protect from a threatening agent entering the nasal passages?we see that there is a wisdom in this kind of defensive fear and protectiveness that keeps the other out. One might see this also in reference to the body's re sistance to infection. There appears to be then a primitive wisdom, as we said earlier, in the isolated action of vasomotor rhinitis, or the tightening of the stomach areas in defense, anger, and fear. The focus is on some narrow percep tion in terms of the way the emotions respond to what appears to the organism as threatening. But we realize that, by a broader insight-aware</page><page sequence="14">20 Journal of Religion and Health ness, this threatening object can assume a totally different perceptual field. This change in perception can relax the fear, anxiety, and the in stinctive defenses. At the same time, the soma itself often responds to this with a relaxed biochemical and physical change. One can see this illustrated by taking a person by surprise and waving one's hand in front of his eyes. The subject's first reaction, because he is responding simply to a threatening object at a primitive subcortical level, is to pull his head back, to blink, and often to experience other primitive threat reactions, such as perspiration in the palms and in creased heart beat. However, if one continues to do this for eight to ten waves of the hand, the subject indicates, often by a slight smile, a re laxed feeling of security. He openly trusts the experimenter. In this experiment nothing is said. What happens is that the subject changes his perception of the field of what is going on and broadens his realization of the whole self, so that he no longer sees himself threatened, but recognizes that he is the object of an illustration in a simple experi ment of defense reflex. Seeing the positive value in what he is doing, he is now somatically, instinctively, and emotionally integrated around his more comprehensive cognitive awareness of the total situation. In this simple illustration we see how the process of taking counsel with the self involves the ego's cognitive working through the whole self and so bringing about a different perception. Consequently, the nar rowed ang5?-segmented view that caused the instincts, soma, and emo tions to have their own narrowed and segmented reaction gives way, through a total self-awareness, to a different gestalt, configuration, or conceptualization. This results in a changed response in the soma, in stincts, and emotions, which are now integrated through the ego's cog nitive struggle to grasp the total situation. This corresponds to the pro cess that brings about greater integrated insight into the mystery of the total self. While this is not the clear and distinct awareness that, ac cording to a mathematical model, our scientific Cartesian culture might demand as prerequisite for a real conviction or proof, yet it has the cog nitive ability to bring about a more integrated response of the whole</page><page sequence="15">What Can Man Believe In? 21 self as a result of a changed and broader self-configuration. The cog nitive aspects of the self somehow penetrate the soma, instincts, and emotions with this new view and so relieve them of their narrow de fenses and cornered sense of angst. The person's struggle to gain broader self-awareness and control in the "eye reflex" experiment illustrates what he needs to experience in the freeing of himself from the bind that his feelings have put him in. The change in the configuration or the perception is the response of the in tegrated self rather than the response of the segmented self. If a person sees himself as the object of an experiment intended as a respectful il lustration, he is in a positive relationship both to himself and to the other person. Therefore, contrary to the primitive defense that only saw an object coming at the eye, there is a re-reading by the cognitive self of the moving hand and a re-interpretation of it. The instincts, soma, and emotions now accept this as not being threatening to the self but as being positive and redemptive, giving the self worth and trusting the self to handle this threat constructively. The whole self then responds by doing just this and no longer defensively blinking and withdrawing. There is genuine, open trust. Handling the threat constructively by an integrated self would be the redeeming act. The ego gives value to the self through the realization that this is not going to be an act that hurts the self. When the self is abandoned in openness?the eye is not blinked, the head not pulled back?it is enhanced and redeemed. The self is now seen as a human person who controls cognitively the instincts, soma, and emotions and is no longer the victim of them. This is the same path, in a more complex way, that any processs of counsel-integration must follow, whether by the person himself or with the aid of counseling. The organism's quest for death We might now explore how there might be purpose or meaning behind the human organism's resistance to trusting both the self and others. We</page><page sequence="16">22 Journal of Religion and Health are led here to Freud's conception, expressed in his Beyond the Pleasure Principle, of the notion of death wish and death instinct as being funda mental to man. According to this concept, the organism recognizes the one irrevocable and certain truth about itself: that it is going to die. The organism recognizes this from the moment of birth, and so is al ways preparing itself to emerge into death. There is thus a purposive intent in the organism by which it tries to maintain itself as close to death as possible throughout its life. If the goal of the organism is death, as it obviously is, then it is to the organism's basic advantage not to al low life forces to take too strong a hold lest they lead the organism false ly away from this obvious goal. Too much commitment to life would seem to make it all the harder for the organism to accept and reconcile itself to death when that inevitable and predictable end is realized. If one sees the primitive intent of preserving the organism for death as its direct end, one recognizes a narrow but profound validity to this kind of death instinct. To be sure, if a man is to die, and of course he is, then it may appear safe to stay close to that goal throughout his life. Contrary to this would be any urges to life that, by definition, would seem to be leading him away from admitting his real immediate goal, which is death; the life urges could even seem to lead to the most tragic of self deceptions, namely, that he is going to continue to live interminably and that he need not face or prepare himself for death. One needs only to look at oneself to realize that man does consciously have this unwillingness to face the inevitable end of his organism. Con sequently, he can tend to set himself up for this tragic self-deception. Seen this way, the counterbalance of the organism holding out for a death instinct and a death wish and always counteracting every life drive of the organism by the reminder of the necessity of its being willing to die offers great, if narrowed, wisdom to the human person. It also offers an understandable counterbalance to the euphoria of assuming that one will live forever, granting that others die. The death instinct and death wish, as Freud called them, then, keep man close to the end of the or ganism even through he is always trying to vault over that inevitable purpose and goal.</page><page sequence="17">What Can Man Believe In? 23 Michelangelo caught something of this human ambiguity and am bivalence toward life and death in two statues, both called "Captive." Clark comments: "one of them struggling to be free?from mortality?? and the other sensuously resigned, 'half in love with easeful death.' "* One figure seems almost literally to be fighting his way out of the stone that surrounds him; the other appears passively, almost narcotical ly, submissive to his linen bind. Emergence of life out of death It is said that of all the acts in the circus, the one that most attracts circus people themselves and that they never tire of watching is the high trapeze act. The reason may be that this act catches the human condition in two of its basic conflicts: the self-preservation polarity, which is to hold on tightly to the swing where one is safe; and the life polarity, which in volves letting go and leaping in the trust that the other will be there to catch him when he has made this great risk of the self. The trapeze act catches the life-and-death struggle that seems to engage us all. On the one hand, the organism wisely cautions us against life impulses and life urges lest they lead us too far into the illusion that we will not die; and on the other, the more cognitive and broader aspects of that same self seem always to be reaching out in self-affirmation beyond the self. There is a leap first from the ego to the self and a trusting of the whole self against all the segmented urges of angst, death, and fear. Then from the trust of the self there is a letting go of oneself and a leaping out in faith to others and, religiously, to the Supreme Other?God. But one must counteract one's death instinct and death wish before any signifi cant life action is possible. There is a certain validity in the protective, inverted tendency of the organism. Since its goal is death, the more the organism becomes in volved in life, the further away from this goal it moves. From a narrow instinctive point of view, it makes limited sense for the organism to cling to death. But an urge in man more representative of the meaning and *Clark, Kenneth, Civilisation. New York, Harper and Row, 1969, p. 126.</page><page sequence="18">24 Journal of Religion and Health purpose of the whole person is the thrust to live?to move out of one self into life and into relationships with others. Like the skilled trapeze artist, a skillfully integrated self lets go of the ego and leaps into the whole self and, beyond this, in faith and trust, to others. The option for openness In their narrowness?while they may fulfill a death wish?the instincts, soma, and emotions can also, for the same reason, deceive a person and cause him to be afraid to live?afraid of trusting himself and others. Such fear and mistrust can result in bitter rejection of the self. These aspects lead away from integration and self-approval to self-disgust and even to a greater state of disintegration and escape. The character of Judas could symbolize this destructive aspect of the death wish in his unwillingness to forgive himself. These same characteristics can be applied to the other. The other is capable of betrayal, of misusing one's trust. In our earlier illustration, the experimenter could actually slap the subject; what the person would feel after this illustrates a fundamental human situation. One solution is expressed in the popular phrase, "Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me." But an alternative would be for the subject to trust the experimenter the third time. He would do this through a broad cognitive realization that the slap was a demonstration that the instincts and emotions are not always wrong, and therefore the slap was not an insult, but the same as before?simply an illustration for everyone's benefit. This would put the subject in a self-attitude that is dignified and redemptive, and not rejecting. He may then willingly trust and be open on the third trial, neither blinking nor pulling his head back. Contrari wise, if he feels that he has been shamed and humiliated and if he cannot see that he was in the same dignified position in the second trial as in the first, he will remain the victim of his own defensive encapsulation. He will not only blink and throw his head back, but probably throw his hands up in defense as well. Or he may refuse to participate further.</page><page sequence="19">What Can Man Believe In? 25 It is this third situation and option that seem to be the human con dition: what does one do after one has been hurt? In this sense, the text that we should love our enemies suggests that we must love that which first appears inimical to us, as the deceptive self may appear inimi cal to the ego when it is in a state of hatred or disgust toward itself. Similarly, another person may appear inimical to one when it seems to him that the other has betrayed and misused his faith. Yet everyone at some time experiences betrayal or abuse. If the human condition is not to settle for the path of "saving one's life" through a narrow protective death wish and so losing the broader and more comprehensive meaning of life; if one is not simply to give up really living by staying as close to death as possible, living, so to speak, in a cemetery; then one takes this risk of repeatedly letting come forth all the life instincts that are in him. He does this in the realization that he could be betrayed, that he could be misused, that in a particular instance, this is possibly a situation "inimical" to him. Yet he still opens himself in love, faith, and trust in the face of that possible option. We do not mean here, of course, that this initial unconditioned re gard must always continue without limits. A due consideration and love of self demands that, at some point, one invoke limits?in a harmful or foolish situation, for example, after repeated efforts. We mean, though, that no genuine relationship seems possible unless one or both persons involved begin with a truly open commitment and engagement. Like Michelangelo's "Captives," one either passively accepts threat and resigns to defensive death withdrawal urges, or, in the alternate statue, one struggles toward life, toward fuller being beyond. The very struggle to change the perception of what appears to be an inimical relationship is in itself a dignifying and life-centered act. Then going beyond that struggle would be the conscious commitment to the opening of oneself. One may and usually does know that one could lose in the relationship; but it is the intentional, purposive act of opening oneself, even in the light of this possible betrayal, that is uniquely for the other and away from protective narcissism.</page><page sequence="20">26 Journal of Religion and Health For this act to be possible, as we have seen, it must flow out of the previous commitment and acceptance of oneself. The ego has in fact been deceived and betrayed many times in the past by the self, and so it will tend not to wapt to take the risk. Yet this is precisely one aspect of the Christian message of loving what may seem "inimical" or an "enemy," namely, that one does go out to what may appear to betray. This also characterizes the human condition?the ego has been betrayed by the self. Unless one can bring these two into some kind of trusting harmony within himself, he cannot go out in love to another, and par ticularly if the other happens at first to seem to be an "enemy." Life-or-death response Applied to others, then, this life-death conflict explains many of the most painful and confusing as well as most glorious and enhancing of hu man experiences. For in any human relationship in and through oneself, the person must first trust himself and his life impulses enough to give himself over in some kind of insightful taking counsel with the self. The resultant cognitive integration then allows him to give a gift of his whole self. This, of course, is a far different thing from talking about simply "loving" others in an intellectual sense. This is a gift of self?including emotions, instincts, and soma?openly to another in an act of trust that is a prelude to and necessary part of an act of love. In the process of this, one's life impulses emerge. One might even say that, at first, these emergent life impulses can startle the other person, much as the hand suddenly waved before the eyes startles the other person, so causing spontaneous defense, negation, and arousal of his death instinct. Because this nega tive response from the other person is unexpected and even illogical, it is one of the most difficult of human experiences to accept. Stated anoth er way, it is understandable that where one has struggled to bring to life some commitment between his ego and his self, and has succeeded in expressing the results of this struggle to another person or to a group, he can, in fact, logically expect their redemptive understanding and shar</page><page sequence="21">What Can Man Believe In? 27 ing. He may logically expect a sharing of his life impulses and of his in tegrated cognitions and deep and even painful self-investments. That is, the person can normally expect what might be called an incarnate-re demptive response on the part of others in which they open themselves emotionally, instinctively, somatically, and cognitively to a genuine ef fort to understand what he is trying to communicate. In fact, however, we know from repeated personal experience in this situation, this kind of response seems only rarely to occur. It most often occurs only when one has made this personal revelation to skilled therapists and counselors, because they themselves have undergone a long and rigorous training. One result of this training enables them to control their self-oriented impulses and really to "understand." These people, by virtue of their skill and self-control, are able to give the kind of understanding, inte grative response that seems so profoundly helpful and gives such a sense of worth and redemptive value to the other person. Why such a skill and art are necessary is evident in the process that the training of people in skilled counseling and psychotherapy reveals. When a person tries to make some kind of life expression about him self, apparently the first impulse aroused in another is an expression of his own death urges. These will segment, distort, and divide what the person has said. "He didn't understand." "He cut me to pieces," he may say afterwards, as he painfully tells others what happened to him. He is describing a divided and segmented feeling that he was not understood at all, that he was fragmented. In trying to communicate himself, he in fact came away wounded, perhaps almost wounded unto death. It will then be very difficult for him to have sufficient trust and hope ever again to struggle to project these personal life urges to anyone else. We may say that this is the description of himself that the client often gives in the beginning stages of counseling or psychotherapy. If a person is talking about a relationship in marriage, it is a painful description of how he has tried to communicate with his wife, or she with her husband, and death effects have followed to the point where he or she has become protectively encrusted and unwilling ever to trust again. The same thing</page><page sequence="22">28 Journal of Religion and Health may happen with children in relation to parents, or parents to children. It can happen to groups of people living or working together. The end effect has been that when one struggled to express some aspect of life, some elements of hope, value, and meaning that were of deep significance to himself, he met with death. The negative, destructive, segmented, divisive responses of others left him nearly dead. In this wounded con dition he understandably comes to the therapist for some kind of skilled healing or therapy. We can say, then, that, rather than understanding, most people respond to another's deep revelation and commitment with responses that are divisive and segmented because such open statements are a threat in that they represent a life force. It is an attempt to segment whatever integration the person has acquired and so reduce him to the same condition as their own. Therefore, a person who attempts to com municate any creative aspects of himself has most often to seek out some one who is skilled in understanding and listening to him, if he is not to stir up death urges. He would have to go to others who have overcome their own death impulses, even if only enough to listen to him and hear him out. This alone helps. But it takes more than this to further his creativity. When such creative understanding occurs, he leaves healed and feeling genuinely fulfilled as a result of such communication. This sensitive understanding, like a successful trapeze act, leaves the one who took the leap positively and constructively encouraged to continue the creative thinking process and, in expressing himself, to be able to hope for and trust in the continuation of such redemptive communication. Model of communication We could say, then, that what the skilled counseling therapist does, out of learned self-control and self-possession demonstrated by his delicate holding to cognitive-feeling life responses, could be the model for what we must all struggle to do with one another in any kind of creative com munication. This could be the model of any kind of effort at communi cation and community. One person would struggle cognitively and per sonally to preserve life by holding himself open to the other and to the</page><page sequence="23">What Can Man Believe In? 29 mysterious struggle for what is valuable and sound in the other's effort to understand himself and to take counsel with himself or to communi cate some plan, project, or series of ideas. He would be able, in a life giving atmosphere, to present himself without defenses. He could con fidently expect understanding and the convalidation of the worth of his communication. This "consensual validation," to use Harry Stack Sul livan's term, or convalidation, would carry with it the confirmation of his value as a person?in his own uniqueness. In a word, such con validation would be "redemptive." The other Until now, while we have considered belief in the other, it has been re lated to the self and self needs. We have primarily interrelated the con flict of the ego in its moving out from angst and death to trust the self. This demands some elements of integration that relate soma, instincts, and emotions to the broader aspects of the self. This process also in volves moving out to the other. There is, however, one special element that encounter with the other offers the self. There is something unique in the other, as other, that the self cannot give itself. Only through the other can the limits of the self be defined and gradually recognized. Childhood begins not only in angst, but also in a narcissistic inversion and self-preservation. The developmental process is a slow and sometimes painful restricting of the self in the process of going out to the other. A person defines the limits of the self as it comes into conflict with, the limits of the other. One sees that there is, in the experience of the other, a kind of limiting of the self's will. This is also a definition, in the most exact sense of that term, a defining and drawing forth from the self, a gradual recognition of its own dimensions. Internalizaron of will to power Alfred Adler's concept of the "will to power," as being in conflict with "will to community," expresses this well. Not only is the self caught up</page><page sequence="24">30 Journal of Religion and Health in narcissistic inversion in early childhood, but its need for identifica tion and meaning comes from a sense of power that others first convey on the self. Then the self gradually conveys this to the self. The will to power flows at first from the child's struggle for independent self-affirma tion and self-identity. In other words, the early process of consensual validation, or convalidation, from the other consists primarily in at tributing to the small and growing child his awareness of and confi dence in his own independent power over many conditions around him. Independence itself involves the dignity that goes with one's own self identity and one's right to guiltless expression of one's will, in certain conditions. Having one's will dignifiedly recognized by the other's ap proval and acquiescence is itself a convalidation of the will to power. One might, therefore, propose that the first redemptive state in the child occurs as his will to power is validated and internalized. Increas ingly, his sense of identity and self-worth is in some measure deter mined by the degree to which this power is recognized by others as com ing from him and having its own rights in him. In the struggle, for example, over the fetish object that many children undergo, a struggle sometimes expressed, too, in their anxieties over nightmare fears, one often sees this. No matter how the therapy proceeds, it reveals a gradual internalizing of the child's power over this fearful object. The child begins to assert himself as being more powerful than the fearful object. The power of this security-giving or fearful object?be it doll or horren dous nightmare image?is in some manner the creation of the child himself. He grows to understand that he has given to the fetish the power to give him security or the nightmare to scare him. He can then take it away and so be independent and freed. In a particular therapeutic series, for example, the child at first has re peatedly drawn his nightmare image, is afraid of it, and is encouraging the therapist to appear to share his great fear of this object. As the ses sions continue, he slowly works through to the fact that he is not afraid of the image because, after all, he made it and he can tear it up. He then asserts his power over the previously fearful image by having the courage</page><page sequence="25">What Can Man Believe In? 31 to tear it up. After doing this over a certain period, he is free of the anxi eties of the nightmare fears. We have here an acting-out of the internal ized fears as an extrinsic assertion of power over the drawn, or hand painted, fear object and the extrinsic act of tearing it up. The assertion of power over that object seems to be concomitant with an internal self assertion of power over the nightmare fear and, therefore, the gradual ac quisition of more peaceful sleep. The sacrifice of self-assertion Seen this way, then, power, as the means of worth, dignity, redemption, and self-identity is basic to a person's sense of value and his own sense of worth. This must, therefore, be conveyed to the child and repeatedly convalidated by all those around him so that he grows confident in his own power, worth, and identity. These are related terms in this sense. It is in and through this sense of power that his sense of worth grows. There is, however, another phase that seems to be the exact opposite of this. It is usually expressed in the fear that the child may become too superior in his pursuit of power and self-excellence. This can happen and can result in a tendency to run over others and to use them. Some times in this manipulation there may be the appearance of caring for them, but only as a deception. The real intent is what others can do for the person himself. Such manipulation, control, and maneuvering of others can assume the self-deceptive disguise fundamental to narcissism. Narcissus, in love with his own image in the pool, never knew that this was not the image of another; when it disappeared as he tried to em brace it, he felt cursed by the gods. One of the deceptive aspects of apparent giving of the self and having faith and trust in others is that it could finally be a self-centered ma neuver. In fact, one has never really given oneself to the other at all. He has always given himself only in those aspects that further represent and enhance himself through the other. This, indeed, would be a Sar trean world of "no exit" from the captivity of the self.</page><page sequence="26">32 Journal of Religion and Health Real encounter with the other aids this development. In any kind of community relationship, in marriage, and in a special way in group counseling or psychotherapy, the boundary lines between selves begin to emerge and assert themselves. Wills to power clash, and as they clash they also define limits of individual selves. It is here that some kind of gift of the self is required. For a going out to the other to occur, one must first possess himself and so have a strong sense of his own identity, power, and worth. One sacrifices this self-power in giving oneself openly to the other. As Adler suggested, will to community, in the sense of genuine com munion and communication with the other, does involve the giving up of the power of the self. The urge to hold on to self-power here might come from that aspect of the self that holds us close to death. In giving up the power of self-affirmation, one gives up, too, the possible self-ag grandizement that this may represent. When one has given up this pow er, one trusts that a greater enlarging of the self will occur. But this oc curs in and through the other, once the abandonment to communion and union with the other has been made. Prior to any gift of the self or belief in hope and love of the other must be the ancient awareness of "to each his own." This includes both the recognition of one's own limits and of the place where the fron tier and dimensions of the other begin. When one has clearly separated himself from the other, he can then give himself to the other as distinct from a narcissistic projection of himself on the other in self-deception. One must be ready to allow the other to function independently in his own self-assertion within the boundaries of his own self-dimension. The other is then seen as a person uniquely different from him and uniquely beyond him. Precisely because of both this unique difference and unique beyondness of the other, a person must genuinely leap out of himself to reach that other. The relationship of the ego to the self, or any other aspects of the self, cannot provide the self-limits that the one's relationship to another de mands. When two people, for example, have internalized the will to</page><page sequence="27">What Can Man Believe In? S3 power in themselves and have had it sufficiently convalidated, this will to power can give way to will to community. Communication between them is then possible. One must give up the will to power in behalf of the other before community and communion can take place. They could do this for one another?each giving up his own self-affirmation as he recognizes the other's prior need to be understood and affirmed. Need to love the other first In order for two wills to power, facing one another, to come to some communion, resolution, and realization, one must give over to the other. To prevent an eyeball-to eyeball death-rejection confrontation and static state, one of them must love first. By loving first we mean that one must openly foreswear his need for self-assertion and open himself to be used by the other. In the model of counseling and therapy, it is the counselor or therapist who first wills to open himself to be used by the other; he makes a love relationship possible by openly loving first. In a theologi cal context, we note, as St. John says, "It is not that we first loved God, but God first loved us." This suggests the necessity of one person giving himself first so that the other may feel convalidation. This gives him worth and validity. When he has arrived at a conviction of his valid self identity, he can begin to open himself to being a kind of instrumentality for another. The will to community can then operate in their relation ship together. This comes from a conscious choice toward community and away from power by one in order that the other may be convalidated and grow in his own identity, self-affirmation, and worth. When two people are experiencing the limits of one another, one or both necessarily must give in to the will to community so that the rela tionship remains one of communion and communication. This kind of conscious, willful giving up of the self to the other can perpetuate itself. One can learn to do this, and will to do it, for another. This would keep alive, constructive, and creative a threefold personal fulfillment in com munication, communion, and community.</page><page sequence="28">34 Journal of Religion and Health Religion as a bind A final concept would be contained in the word "religion." By "religion" here we mean, first of all, its common literal interpretation as being re lated to the idea of a bind, or bond. Any genuine relationship with the other is, in this sense, religious because it binds two or more people. As we have said, one can manipulate and maneuver the other for oneself narcissistically, and one can even go so far as to suppress any confused self-awareness that one is doing this. One can consciously deceive himself into thinking that he is genuinely concerned for, has faith in, and is going out to the other when, in fact, he has never left the safe protection of the trapeze swing. He is only enticing and maneuvering the other to trust him, but he will manipulate and control him as he pleases. To break into this protective bind one must establish, by way of a faith commitment and abandonment, a different kind of bind or bond. This is a communion with the other that is open, unprotective, and ex pressive of life. The opposite is a closed and protective death wish of self inversion and narcissistic encapsulation. This kind of bind has to be willed. It is free because the opposite is always possible. Such a concept of "religion," then, is both free and an act of hope and love as well as of faith. Were it not in some measure a genuine option, it would have no meaning as a true commitment. Abandonment to a total Other If we apply this concept of "religion" to others, it constitutes a bind or bond freely willed. In a very special sense, however, this concept of re ligion is, as generally understood, particularly applicable to that Other who is unique and for whom we use the name God. A person's approach to that Other, who is God, can take a variety of forms. He may, in the classical, reasonable Preambula Fidei, propose to himself that behind many of the confusions and conflicts of nature there is yet an orderliness and design. This implies a kind of force that is intelligent and that de</page><page sequence="29">What Can Man Believe In? 35 termines life and life's purpose and so leads one to the recognition of the existence of God. From such a recognition one can make the same kind of commitment and bind, in the sense of religion, that he makes toward another. But the conditions of this bond are that he is binding himself to the Other usually according to one of the various traditional mean ings that we attribute to the word "God." Alternately, a person can arrive at a need for and commitment to God through an awareness of his own restlessness and the inadequacy of all possible life goals. This would be an intuition of the Other in a basic Augustinian sense. That is, one's whole being cries out in restlessness for some kind of total fulfillment and projection. A person can simply accept and admit the existence of such a Being and abandon himself. The experience of the friendship and love of that Being would follow from a kind of mystical awareness of prayer and divine communication. However one does this, and by whatever creedal codes and delinea tions, whether Judaeo or Christian or otherwise, he binds and encapsu lates himself through his faith commitment. One has bound him self in a commitment similar to his faith commitment both to himself and to others. But he has now committed himself in a very special way to that Being behind all beings, that unknown God. This is a rela tionship with the most mysterious of all the unfathomable mysteries of life. It can, therefore, represent the most total and most complete gift of oneself that is possible. One might see the religious bind to God as the ultimate fulfillment and zenith of all abandonments that one makes of oneself to others. Insofar as one abandons himself to another human being, there is always some kind of reflection of himself in that being, offering him some kind of narcissistic reassurance. He can say this being has existence similar to his own. While all religions, in a special way, have some anthropomorphic elements in their image of God, the Judaeo and Christian religions have a highly personalized God. They have giv en us a belief in a God who is deeply sharing of the human condition and deeply understanding of all aspects of man. Yet even here the nature of the abandonment to God, as God, is totally beyond any image in man.</page><page sequence="30">36 Journal of Religion and Health The unconditioned commitment One might, then, from this point of view, propose that Religion, in the capital sense of that word as applied to God, is a very special bind of the self to the Other. It must, at its final level, be a total kind of faith in mystery because, by definition, the abandonment to this Other is Anoth er totally beyond man. While in most religious traditions the God-figure has, in some form, become incarnate or at least communicated with man in a human way, yet the human communication itself is only God's means of loving man and opening himself to man's needs and limits. By definition, God, in his own being, is a totally nonnarcissistic object of man's faith, hope, and love. This is why one must make a complete act of faith in God, despite whatever rational evidences and proofs may lead one to some kind of conviction of the existence and significance of God. In the act of faith one must abandon oneself to another totally be yond the self and others. This is the unique quality of a religious bind. Any notion of faith then involves the experience of "binding," and so is closely associated with religion. A person who has in some way freely bound himself to another has made an act of faith and, therefore, in a general sense, could be considered a "religious" person. But in the for mal religious sense, the ultimate act of faith entails a bind to what is most mysterious and unknowable. One has the most to lose in es tablishing a bind with this kind of Being. Consequently, the risk of self and the faith commitment involved is the greatest possible?greater than a belief in and commitment to any other person. If the risk of love is the norm of man's highest humanity, then in a certain sense the love of God would be the most effulgent expression of this humanity. This is the most complete act of faith that one can make because it is the ultimate risk and ultimate bind. In this context one might even say that the ex tent to which one can relate nonnarcissistically to others could deter mine the extent to which he can relate to and establish this bond with the Ultimate Other.</page><page sequence="31">What Can Man Believe In? 37 Man: both being and becoming To sum up, we have proposed that man can have faith in himself, in others, and in God. We have defined faith by saying that, while secon darily it involves creedal statements and propositions, it is primarily the expression of a man's own life force as he moves out of himself in open ness to others. But he does this, first of all, by being open to all aspects of himself, particularly the mysterious areas of his somatic, instinctive, and emotional world. In trusting himself to these, he grows to see that even in their narrowed and segmented aspects, there is some purposive meaning. These still have their significance and value. By cognitive per suasiveness, man brings an integrated awareness in his action around the insightful taking counsel with himself. The resultant self-decision se cures the integrated co-operation of his whole psychosomatic person. He does this first with himself. As a result of the life forces that emerge, he then opens himself to open communication with and genuine faith in and trust of others. Through conscious control of his own will to power, a man can open ly abandon himself to others' use of him, either according to the model of the skilled counselor or therapist or in the personal communion and community sense of a faith, hope, and love engagement with others. Out of the binds between himself and others and between the ego and the somatic, instinctive, and emotive aspects of the self, the most funda mental bond or commitment of all, that of profound Religious faith, can emerge. This is the leap to and the abandonment of oneself in a life ex perience in believing in, hoping in, and striving to love and so com mune with the Divine Being whom we call God. We have proposed that the same elements enter into all three commit ments. The difference, we submit, is that they mount in the degree to which they demand a total abandonment of the self. One abandons one self first to one's whole self, rather than merely to the immediately con scious aspects of the self. One then limits oneself in recognizing the</page><page sequence="32">38 Journal of Religion and Health limits of the other who, in large measure, reflects and resembles the self. A third kind of possible commitment is that to a total Other whom we call God and who is totally beyond the self. By its nature, this demands the most complete faith and commitment of ourselves. We have pro posed that the answer to the question of "What can man believe in?" is that man can believe in all three and, in proportion as he acts out, in tegrates, and commits himself to the life forces of this belief, he can know and experience a life beyond himself. This can also be a faith in volvement in a life beyond the death encapsulation that is the most evi dent goal he sees. Freud, in discussing his concept of "Beyond the Pleasure Principle," was delighted when Jones suggested to him that a good translation of his German term jenseits would be "hereafter." Freud was pleased by this word because he heard it freshly, as people often do in a language they do not know well. He saw it not as a "here," followed by an "after," but as a word that is simultaneously "here," fusing into "after." If we look carefully, the word "beyond" also expresses this because it is being that is moving toward the "yonder." In this sense, we would propose that what man can believe in is not only his humanity, in a static sense, but his humanity becoming beyond. In the combination of the "here" fusing into the "after," he is simultaneously "be-ing," "be-coming," "be-yond," as he fuses from the "here" into the "after." An ancient Greek idea of the human transient condition was that of an arrow flying through the air. At no point is it "here." When one tries to locate it at a given point, it is already "after" and moving further into the "after" and "beyond." Something of this image catches man as he moves from the ego toward the integrated self and then out to others, and from this, out to God. This is the human being in the here-after that man can believe in. One can say, then, that the basis of all faith is contained in the bind between the ego and the self. The same elements that are there are also between the self and others, and between the self and God. This repre sents a process of constant moving out of the ego and the self toward the</page><page sequence="33">What Can Man Believe In? 39 beyond. This could be expressed in the definition of man as a "being-be coming-beyond." Man starts with the relationship of the ego to the self and moves to commitment to others and to God. This is the being in process of becoming beyond. But a person does not have to do any of these things. One never has to leave the ego; he can stay in a narcissistic womb as long as he chooses, never having to go out to the other; nor does he need to go beyond the other to any final Other. These things are in one's power to do or not to do. A basic dynamic, then, is the element of freedom that marks belief. A person is not forced into making this kind of bind or commitment, but if he does make the commitment he can experience a greater integration of himself and an enlarging of himself as he goes out to others and through others to God. This gift of the self to God would be made in the faith conviction that this experience would go beyond death into life. It may seem strange, but for the human condition it is faith and trust in the unknown in oneself and others, rather than the predictable, the studied-out, the carefully analyzed that leads to the really fulfilling hu man experiences. The carefully figured-out situation is often character istic of the purely self-protective, whereas it is the mysterious, unknown, and unclear that seems to provide the opportunity for this leap, the trapezelike letting oneself go in a faith commitment to others and, in a religious sense, to a final Other. This is our meaning when we say that a man can believe in himself, others, and God.</page></plain_text>
