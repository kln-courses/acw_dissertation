White, professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan, believes that too little attention has been devoted to "culturology," the science of the interaction of cultural elements stressing "the relation between the human organism, on the one hand, and the extra-somatic tradition that is cul- ture on the other hand." So he has put together, after revision, some ten of his previously published articles, some addresses delivered before scientific so- cieties, and four additional chapters "written expressly for this volume." He is interested in demonstrating how cultural variations or differences between tribes and nations result from different pressures and circumstances, but espe- cially from a culture continuum "that flows freely down through time from one generation to another and laterally from one race or habitat to another." This seems, almost, to be what many folklorists are concerned with also. The following list of some of the chapter titles will indicate something of Professor White's range in his attempt to establish the point of view, the scope, the methodology, and the distinction from psychology of "culturol- ogy": "Science is Sciencing," "The Symbol: the Origin and Basis of Human Behavior," "On the Use of Tools by Primates," "Mind is Minding," "Cul- tural Determinants of Mind," "Genius: Its Causes and Incidence,"</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS OF BOOKS 395 "Ikhnaton: The Great Man vs. the Culture Process," "The Locus of Mathe- matical Reality," "Man's Control over Civilization: An Anthropocentric Illusion," and "Energy and the Evolution of Culture." Even though one may not agree with the thoroughgoing scientific deter- minism of the author, one will find this book informative and stimulating. It provides a useful point of view to be used in the analysis of folk thought and shows how even the so-called leaders of civilization are shaped by the cultural forces of their day, the prevailing technologies, institutions, and philosophies. "The Great Man is the instrument, the Ideology, the rationalization, of the social organism as it struggles for survival in the international jungle of nations." Believing that "one can science in any sector of experience," Pro- fessor White opposes science's rival, "the philosophy of anthropomorphism, anthropocentrism, and Free Will," by reference to history and to current human behavior. He provides "a dynamic interpretation of culture growth in terms of the most fundamental factor, namely, energy." "And now culture has succeeded in penetrating to the core of matter itself and has learned how to create energy.... Whether it can be done with impunity remains to be seen." At times Professor White seems to invite argument, but one should advance disagreements cautiously. The author is a man of decided conviction and of wide reading, as his extensive Bibliography and Chapter References indicate. He deserves careful reading. LEvi= J.
