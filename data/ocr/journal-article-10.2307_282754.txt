We take it for granted and despise him who fails to feel it and manifest it towards his fellowmen and towards his God. But though the psychology of gratitude towards men is still almost an untilled field, psychologists recognize that the emo- tion is far from simple 1 or primitive, but is one of the more developed products of our human nature. But gratitude to God must have arisen still later. It presupposes a consid- erable degree of anthropomorphism. Man believes that his gods desire the manifestation of gratitude for favors con- ferred only because he himself desires it, and because he conceives his gods to be of like passions with himself. It presupposes also that the purely magical stage of religion has been left behind. No thanks are due for benefits ex- torted from the god by magical formula or act. It is only benefits freely conferred that call forth the emotion of genuine gratitude. Man does not feel obliged to offer thanks for what he believes to be due to his own knowledge of a formula, rather than to his god's good will. The benefit he has thus received is not a gift and calls for nothing in return. With the rise of the gift theory of sacrifice, it was perhaps inevitable that the recognition -of the duty of gratitude to God should result in some sort of a thank-offering, but what were the steps of the process? It is from the standpoint of the Greek religion that I shall approach the subject in this paper. Beyond a cursory mention in some of the manuals of Greek religion, there seems to be practically no literature upon the Greek thank-offering. Nor outside the field of Greek religion has the subject of the expression of gratitude to God in act and prayer been at all adequately treated; except for a few 1 MacDougall, Introduction to Social Psychology, 132.</page><page sequence="2">96 Joscph [Iilliam Hewitt [1912 illuminating pages in Wundt's Myt/zus zmnd Religion,l little light has been shed upon it. In Hebrew cult, notwithstand- ing the copious ritual literature of the Pentateuch, the very terminology of this kind of sacrifice is in such confusion, especially in the English versions, that it is hard to tell with any certainty what rites were thank-offerings.2 The subject was brought to my attention as I attempted to put in order a collection I had been making of passages deal- ing with propitiation, a subject on which there is a more abundant, though still wofully inadequate, literature. I found a number of cases where rites almost certainly propitiatory in the main were strongly impregnated with thanksgiving or even bore the technical name of the thank-offering.3 This at once posed the question of the relation of the two types of sacrifice. Were they of independent origin, or was one derived from the other? My own hypothesis, based on the study of a large number of passages which mention or sug- gest thank-offering, is that its origin is not simple, but that several different lines of cult were converging toward this lofty and complex feature of religion. The object of this paper is to present from my collection a number of passages, some of them not a little familiar, which seem to me to shed light upon this particular point and show the thank-offering already far beyond the stage of magic and in process of evolution from (a) the payment of a vow, (b) the sacrifice of propitiation, (c) the celebration banquet; with brief prefatory discussion of the evidence to be found in our earliest sources, the Homeric poems. In a study of development it is the border line instances that are of most significance and the evidence in these poems is largely of this character. In spite of the remarkably ad- 1 VFokerpsjchologie, 2, Bd. II, 333 f., 338, 341 f., 447 ff., 46I; III, io8, 144, i68, 657 ff.; he traces it back through propitiation to the primeval 'Zauber- motiv.' Its object is, partly at least, to retain for the future the favor of demons and gods, e.g. II, 333 f., 338- 2 See Moore on Judges xx, 26 (Intern. Crit.

As I ponder the instances that have been considered such, I suspect that few or none of them are at all pure thanksgiving. In Iliad, Ix, 533, Artemis sends a wild boar to punish Oeneus for neglecting to pay the harvest offering (6aXvo-tca) to her. But was the harvest offering a thanksgiving ? Seymour 1 so con- sidered it, but glance through a list of more or less primitive harvest ceremonies, as, for instance, that in Frazer's Dying God,2 and you will find surprisingly little that is unequivocally thank-offering. Such rites were brought into causal connec- tion not with the crop just harvested, but with the fertility of the field for the succeeding year,3 and were probably, as Wundt4 maintains, magical in their origin. Of course they ultimately became thanksgiving and in Homer's time were already on their way to become such, how far on their way is precisely the question. Certainly the Homeric Greek had not attained the height of the Hebrew idea 5 that thank-offer- ings were not required but were freewill gifts which God did not demand, but was of course gratified to receive. Artemis does demand the harvest offering, and the extreme vigor of her insistence imports into the rite a considerable element of propitiation. The impression the passage would leave upon the Homeric audience would be that the firstfruits must be offered6 to keep the deity in good humor and avert ill con- sequences. Gratitude so motivated is not yet gratitude. The sacrifice offered by Nestor and his company at the southern point of Euboea7 after their voyage across the Aegean on their way home has also been interpreted as 'Life in thze Homeric Age, 500. 2 Pp. 20 ff.

But the peril is not yet past; much of the journey remains to be accomplished, and the sacrifice is offered to Poseidon, the deity from whom they had most to fear. The sacrifice is, perhaps, not essentially different from that in I59 ff., performed on Tenedos. Nei- ther has sole reference to the past, but each is chiefly a pre- cautioin in view of a perilous future enterprise.' I hesitate to say that no thank-offerings at all are recorded in Homer, but, if there are, the accounts of them are certainly very curiously confused. The contrast is striking between, e.g., Longus, who relates the performance of repeated thank- offerings on every possible occasion,2 and Homer, who makes no definite mention of gratitude nor of its expression in sacrifice even where it seems a priori inevitable. Take, for instance, the passage3 where Odysseus has at length been landed upon his native isle after twenty years of wandering. When he awakes and recognizes his whereabouts, he lifts up his hands and prays. But he prays to the Ithacan nymphs, who have had no hand in his return, and he says, " Rejoice for the present in kindly vows, but (in the future) we shall give you gifts as well (i.e. we shall pay our vows), just as we did before." Offerings are to be forthcoming, but they are not, specifically at least, thank-offerings for his preser- vation and safe return, but merely the resumption of the honorific (possibly propitiatory 4) sacrifices he used to accord 1 Cf. the sacrifice offered by the Argonauts after their deliverance from the Syrtis (Apollonius Rhodius, IV, 1594 ff.). Though offered to the deity who has served them, there is not a word of thanks, but the prayer is (1598): 1XraLt, KaLI vT6TOLO trXos OvqU# s 6irare. Cf. 1547. In 649 f. there seems to be reference to a thank-offering, probably, however, in fulfilment of vows made in 587 if. 2 E.g. II, 31; IV, 26, I if.; IV', 32, 3; IV, 37, 2. 3 Od. XIII, 355 ff., a prayer of thanksgiving, according to Ausfeld, Jahrbiicher, Suppbd. XXVIII, 509. 4 In the Greece of old (Theocr. XIII, 44), as in the Greece of to-day (Farnell, Cul/s of Greek S/taes, V, 426), the nymphs had an uncanny character and were felt to require propitiation (Frazer, Pazesanias, V, 20 f.). With the address of Odysseus to the nymphs compare the Roman custom of greeting the Penates after a prolonged absence from home, Terence, Phormio, 31I, and, for Greece, Eur. Herc.

Among these Homeric instances we have found mention of undefined sacrifices offered at a time when propitiation might have been expected. Homer seems to know little or nothing of ritual propitiation; only the faintest traces of the propitiatory ritual, doubtless common long before, as it cer- tainly was long after, his time, are found in these poems. But in one or two instances we find the terminology of pro- pitiation attached to rites which otherwise would rather sug- gest thanksgiving. In the first Iliad (472) Chryses makes a sacrifice upon the restoration of his captive daughter, and entertains with a banquet the men who have brought her back. Wine and song enliven the occasion, and certainly then, if ever, we should expect Chryses to be performing a thank-offering. But the poet tells us o0 8e wav7ramLeptot ,wXi7r oEv iXdacovro. Is, then, the rite that. looked like a thank- offering really a propitiation? We must not say so too hastily. The only apparent need of propitiation is on the part of the Greek guests, whose king had insulted Apollo's priest, and such a rite would be more appropriate in the Greek camp than in the injured priest's house. Further, the normal rites of propitiation were peculiar and quite distinct, and the worshippers were usually forbidden to partake of the sacrificial meat. This feast has none of the regular earmarks of propitiation as we find it outside the Homeric poems. Then, too, need we translate lXd'a-coirTo by the meaning it had in the later literature ? Does it mean anything more, here, than "make (or keep) benignant"? Even so, there would be a distinct suggestion of the necessity of keeping (a fortiori of making) the deity benignant. And observe that the song they use is the paean, which, as Fairbanksl has shown, developed into its later festal use from a distinctly deprecatory and apotropaic significance. Observe, too, that it is to Apollo in his aver- tive capacity of &amp;caepyoc2 that the song is addressed. And I'" A Study of the Greek Paean," Cornell Studies in Class.

Hector promises that if Zeus will grant the Trojans to drive out the Achaean foe and circulate the winebowl freely in their halls, he will - thank the gods ? No, he will appease (atpEJo-o7EO'1) the gods. If the Homeric poet knows of the thank-offering, he evidently has at his com- mand no terminology to describe it, but is struggling with lan- guage that still bears the flavor of the propitiatory sacrifice.2 There is one more Homeric instance which merits a word. It is the passage in the Odyssey (XII, 346 ff.) where the fam- ishing companions of Odysseus determine to disregard his warnings and slay the sacred cattle of Helios. " And if we come safe to Ithaca, we will make a temple for Helios and statues." Had this promise, or vow, ever been fulfilled, it is easy to see that its performance might have been interpreted as a thank-offering for preservation; but in its context it is evident that the* object of those who promised it was to dis- arm the god's wrath at the contemplated injury to his herds, -an attempt to purchase an indulgence, as it were. The development of the vow to the thank-offering is a very natu- ral one; indeed, in some cases it can actually be traced. The votive offering is not unknown to Homer. This, at least in later times, regularly appears in payment of a vow, or as thank-offering, but there are instances in Homer where it is clear that not thanks for the past, but propitiation for the future, is the intent of the gift, for it is offered where no benefit has been received and is designed rather to secure than to acknowledge the divine favor. Such is the garment offered to Athena3 by the Trojan women in the stress of the siege. Herodotus4 includes expensive dedicatory offerings 1 This word, though later it often means 'please,' in Homer regularly connotes placation of an offended person or deity. So, eg., A/. ix, 120; Od. VIII, 396. 2 In striking contrast to Homer's obscurity or silence is the clear and definite account of a thank-offering performedl by a Homeric character as described by Dionysius of Halicarnassus (1, 55, 2), wAho wrote when the thank-cffering had obtained a recognized standing in the religious world. The practice of Apollo- nius Rhodius is nearer that of Homer. See p. 98, n. I. 3 II. VI, 88 ff.; cf. Od. XVI, 185. 4 1, 90 f.; cf. Xen. Cyr. VII, 2, 19. In Luc.

It is natural to suppose that the propitiatory significance of the dedicatory gift preceded its use as a thank- offering. Hock,' in his important work, Griecliisclhe Welihege- brduchie, finds its origin in the grave cult and the worship of the dead, where it would certainly not be a thanksgiving, nor even the payment of a vow, but would be very near the pro- pitiation or the averting of harm that are so often found in connection with the cult of the dead, and are considered by Wundt 2 to be the most primitive type of real sacrifice.3 From its origin in the lower strata of religious practice, the dedica- tory offering rose to be the payment of a vow made in time of peril. This brought it to the higher ranges of the domain of propitiation, whence it became an offering of thanksgiving. But this last step was a great advance, for it was progress from the mere payment of what was little more than a busi- ness obligation, to a rite involving the emotion of gratitude. As early as Xenophon4 the payment of a vow is called a thank-offering (a-wrTpta) or, perhaps I should say, is called by a term that was becoming one of the two commonest words for thank-offering.5 The process of the evolution is well por- trayed in the following familiar incident. Before Marathon the Athenians vowed to sacrifice to Artemis as many goats 1 See Bursians Jahresb. CXL, III, 7. 2 Alyfthus und Religion, 1I, 449. 3 If it be true that the dva6O7,aa rose from the cult of the dead to become a frequent accompaniment of the thank-offering, its development would be fairly paralleled by that of athletic games, provided, again, that these were, as Korte thinks (Hermes, XXXIX, 226 ff.), originally employed at the burial of the dead. See also Gruppe, Bericht iiber Mythologie und Religionsgeschzichte, i898-1905, 35I. (But for other views, especially of the Olympic games, see Coolk in Folk-lore, xv, 398 if., and Cornford in Miss Harrison's Themis, 212-259). The games at the funeral of Patroclus are clearly no part of a thank-offering, they are to honor or appease the dead. If such games regularly accompanied the funeral of those who had fallen in battle, they might easily come to be part of a celebration of the victory which the fallen had helped achieve, even when funeral rites are not stated to have been connected with the contests. See Arrian, Anab. V, 20, I, compared with II, 24, 6 and v, 29, I. 4 Anab. III, 2, 9. 5 Herodotus (i, II8) uses o-G.Zo-rpa of the thank-offering.</page><page sequence="8">I02 Joscpk William Hewitt [19E12 as they should kill Persians.' But finding it impossible to secure enough goats to pay their vow at once, they deter- mined to pay it in annual instalments of five hundred each. Seven hundred years later they were still performing this annual sacrifice,2 but as they had slain only 6400 Persians,3 the vow would have been paid off in about thirteen years if no interruption supervened. Evidently, in the joy of their signal deliverance, emphasized, perhaps, by the stirring events of ten years later, the Athenians had continued a joyous and doubtless popular feast, which had already come to be viewed in the light of a thanksgiving.4 Of Agesilaus, Xenophon5 says that he was grateful to the gods when he had good fortune, and that when he was out of dangTer he used to sacrifice more than he had vowed when he was in trouble. In this very utterance, which shows that a Spartani could feel real gratitude to God and desire to express it in act, we see that no thank-offering is thought of aside from the payment of the vow.6 It is still only a bonus added to what was due the gods as a matter of cold business, - not yet a separate sacrifice. Xenophon is perhaps the earliest Greek writer to lay marked stress upon the thank-offer- ing.7 He reveals an almost anachronistic conception of man's 1 Xen. Anab. I1I, 2, 12; cf. Schol. on Ar. Eq. 66o. 2 Aelian, Var. Hist. II, 25; by this time the number of the goats annually sacrificed had apparently been reduced to three hundred. Or Aelian may be in error in this detail, as he is regarding the date on which the sacrifice was made. See Sandys on Aristotle, Pol. Ath. 58, I. 3 Herod. VI, 117. 4 On the aiialogy of this feast, others would be established, as, for instance, the annual thank-offering for the battle of Plataea, rendered to the nymphs of a cave on Mount Cithaeron (Plut. Aristid. I9, cf. I I), possibly in payment of some vow made before or in the battle. With this was coupled an offering to Zeus Eleutherios (ibid.), who would tend to absorb the whole ceremony. Though Pausanias knows of the Sphragitid nymphs (Ix, 3, 9), he ascribes the cult to Zeus alone (Ix, 2, 5f.). 5 Ages. II, 2. 6 Cf. Psalm cxvi, 12, 14, 17, i8, where to the question " What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits unto me? " the twice uttered answer is " I will pay my vows unto the Lord." 7 E.g. Anab.

The loftiest and purest instance of thanksgiving I have found anywhere in Greek literature is that recorded of Cyrus the Great at the end of his life.2 But some of the cases mentioned in Xenophon seem to have been payment of vows.3 Later in the century the references to thank-offering become fairly frequent, but they are often still curiously shot through with the terminology, the ritual, and even the spirit of propitiation. In the dramatists the passages that refer to the thank- offering, or may reasonably be taken to imply its existence, are fairly frequent. Some of the instances that might be quoted as such, to be sure, do not bear critical examination. Eur. Heraclidae, 867 ff. is a case in point. There is a prayer of gratitude, but 877, Kat Alot waots 0 e, % need mean no more, in its connection, than "you will get back home again." 4 It is not clear that any special offering of thanks is meant. The o-WTopca and Tpo7raia of 402 are not thank-offerings and trophies, but propitiatory sacrifices to turn back the enemy and save the state. Nor does the promise in Aeschylus, Cho. 483 if. refer to a thanksgiving for the aid that the brother and sister are praying their dead father to grant. What is promised is, on the one hand, the regular rites in honor of the dead,- and these were pre- cautionary if not actually avertive; on the other, the marriage libations, Xoai ryap Xi\oc, which are not to be considered in any sense a thanksgiving for the marriage (see Aesch. Eum. 834 ff.). So too, certain passages that unquestionably refer to thanksgiving have about them a curious flavor of something else. For instance at the end of the Alcestis, the people are ordered by Admetus jopmlg TE xcvtcrav 83ov9ViT-oa-1 7rpoa-Tpovnat9 where the last word has the connotation of propitiation and 1 Ages.

I50 ff.) has a curious reference to ;zocintzal choruses to the temples of all the gods, at the deliverance of Thebes from siege. Aeschyltis (Ag. 594) refers to the sacrifice offered by Clytemnestra on the news of Troy's fall. To be sure, we see that all the time it is, in the mind of the sacrificer, a propitiatory rite, but the situation presupposes the propriety and the likelihood of her offering a sacrifice of thanksgiving. Sugppl. 980 ff. implies a thank-offering to Soter gods, and clear cases occur, e.g. in Sophocles, Alax, 9I1i f., and in Euripides, Ion, 1123 f., I130. Though the bonus was not required, the vow itself must be paid, or serious consequences might ensue. Camillus2 at Rome neglected to perform a vow and was informed by seers that God's anger required propitiation and thanks- giving (XaptorTpw'wv)-a curious combination. In this sole instance Liddell and Scott render Xapto#? pta by the word siipplicatio, and possibly the double (propitiatory and gratu- latory) significance of the Latin word, which he doubtless found in his soturces, may have confused Plutarch. But we must remember that by his time the payment of a vow had come to be regarded as thanksgiving.3 The word i'Xao7id in this last passage conducts us natu- rally to another phase of the thank-offering. May not certain rites of thanksgiving have had their origin in actual and unl- disguised propitiation? The confusion of the two in Homer we have already discussed, and I believe it traceable far beyond the early epic. Theognis, urging a cheerful libation to the gods4 when the Medic invasion was threatening the 1 Lidclell and Scott recognize this fact, but perhaps not adequately; for example, as an instance of a colorless meaning for 7rpoorpo7rij, any address to a god,' they cite Aesch.

With the growth of a higher type of religion and the partial disap- pearance of the anxious fear which characterizes the lower stages, the transformation of the propitiatory to the thank- offering is quite natural.2 The very etymology of the two com- monest terms for the thank-offering (JwoT4'pta and XaptOfT pta) seems to put us not after the event, looking back at it, but before the event and looking forward to it with a greater or less degree of apprehension. o-rrTptov should denote a means of saving,3 XaptCTaptov should signify a means of pleasing, perhaps of appeasing.4 But as early as Xenophon' the neuter plural of these words has taken on a technical signifi- cance and denotes thank-offering. From Xenophon to about the time of the Christian era the two words are rare; they become common only when we find the thank-offering itself fully developed. In fact, it is overdeveloped. It is going to seed. Real thanksgiving connotes real religion, and, in spite of Paul's compliment to the Athenians, I fear that the Greeks of the imperial period were not " very religious." More and more it became customary to institute so-called thanksgivings merely in commemoration of some happy event or of some human being to whom a city attributed its safety,6 and even at that 1 Dion. Hal. V, 57, 5. 2 In Hec. 136 ff. Euripides speaks as if the sacrifices to the dead were thank- offerings. The Greeks would be acXdpto-rot to omit them. 3 See, for instance, Eur.

I have space merely to mention certain specific instances of the development of rites from propitiation to thank-offer- ing. The Attic feast of the Proerosia, an ancient propitia- tory ritual,2 employed before ploughing, was closely coninected with thank-offerings sent to Athens from other communities in gratitude for relief from the pestilence which the Proerosia had been instituted to avert.3 And then there is the puzzling Procharisteria, or. " thank- offerinig before the event," 4 an ancient rite held in spriing when the crops were beginning to grow. The expression iVEp Tr&amp;Y PvoFte'vwv Kap7r&amp;v5 may be interpreted either as pro- pitiatioil or as thanks, but it seems curious to offer thanks for the half-grown crops at the most perilous stage of their growth, and I cannot find another instance of an agricultural feast of thanksgiving in the spring.7 It looks like propitia- tion, but, if it was, it acquired in some way a name that, in spite of its anomalous prefix, would suggest to every Greek a rite of thanksgiving. 1 Paus. x, I[, 5. 2 Farnell, Cuts, IIJ, 42; Schol. Ar. Eq. 729. 3 Schol. Ar. Plut. 1054. For a possible cause of the connection see Farnell, Cults, I1I, 43 f. 4 Suidas, s.v. HpoxapIoTr'pLa, Bekk. Anec. 295. Harpocration has 7rpooXapL- oi-'pLa, but this form is pretty certainly wrong. See Mommsen, Feste der Stadt A/hen, 3651. 5 rep perhaps suggests propitiation: Il. I, 444; Xen. Oec. 5, 20; Eur. Phoen. 913; Herod. vII, 114; but it is used also of thanksgiving: Arr. Anab. vi, 28, 3; Ditt. Syll. 209, 22; 649, 23, etc.; Et. Mag. 706, 44; Plut. Aristides, I9, etc. 6 Band, Diasien, ig f. 7 Dion. Hal. I, 88, 3, thus describes the Roman Parilia: 6ovut . . . vo,Ie?s OuoTla XaPOTT'6PLOP gapos dpXoidi'ov. But this is clearly not its original function (Wissowa, Religion der RUmner, i66; Peter on Ovid, Fasti, IV, 721 ff.). Its con- nection with the For(licidia, the use of sulphur and of the apotropaic laurel, the leaping through fire, etc., all point to a feast not of thanksgiving but of lustra- tion and propitiation. When the Parilia became a feast in memory of the found- ing of Rome (Wissowa, ibid.), it was natural that the day should be spent, as Dionysius says, ev ebraOelcas and be considered a cheerful thank-offering, cf. Theognis, 775 ff. Farnell ( CutS, IV, 287 ff.) has shown good reason to doubt that the feast that celebrated Apollo's return from the Hyperboreans came as early as the beginning or even the end of spring. And, in any event, such a festival is an epiphany feast rather than a thank-offering.</page><page sequence="13">Vol. xliii] The Thzank-offering among tlhe Greeks I07 The Halola is another rite of ambiguous significance, - so, ambiguous that, while Nilsson ' considers its object to be the prosperity of the germinating seed, Stengel calls it a harvest thanksgiving.2 It may well have been the former, until the growth of the notion that God demanded the expression of gratitude caused it to be interpreted as a thanksgiving. The EipECTl6W seems to have undergone a parallel change of sig- nificance. It is mentioned twice in Aristophanes,3 btut with no hint that it was considered in any sense a thank-offering. It probably was, in fact, a charm hung over the door as a protection against famine.4 But the scholiasts speak of it as a thank-offering, apparently confusing it with the offering of avapXat', to which one scholium5 refers rather vaguely &amp;%fn-ep xaptarqpLoV, while another6 more explicitly uses the techni- cal term for the thank-offering, the plural xapta-r'Pta. A scholiast on the same passage seems to be aware that it was instituted to avert a famine, but that does not prevent him from calling it a thank-offering, for such it probably was in his day. The same confusion of inconsistent ideas is illus- trated by a page of Demosthenes, containing sundry oracles which prescribe thank-offering to Bromios7 and dances and the wearing of garlands and wvaa-t8opeiv, but mix therewith rites to be performed O'T TaS' &amp;5pa9 Trap?peEyKaTe Tp Ovct'ala Kas T i; OCO)pt'a9 and sacrifices to Apollo ApotropaeusA8 The scholiast on Pax, 923 applies the term xapUTarpta to the pots of pulse which were placed before newly consecrated statues, apparently only those of minor deities.

This is from the realm of myth and has a distinctly aetiological flavor, besides finding no justification in the rite itself. A more reasonable explalnation is the second,2 which has at least the outward appearance of being historical. Though it doubtless does not tell the whole story,3 it suggests propitia- tion and reminds us of the propitiatory procession of the Trojan women with a peplos to the temple of Athena.4 There can be little doubt that the rpowatov, raised after battle, was viewed as a thank-offering to the god to whom it was dedicated. I have suspected for some time, however, that it was in its origin an a'7orpwratov,5 and I find my sus- picion confirmed in a work on the Tropaeum Traianum.6 The derivation from rpo7rr? seems to date only from Varro, and the trophy was not necessarily erected at the point where the flight began. To remove the arms from the dead removes his ability to execute vengeance on his slayer and is on a par with 4aoXaXto-,o09.7 Like the gratulatory significance of the trophy, the sacri- fice of victory (vtKqpr' pta) must have been a comparatively late development in Greek religion. Conservative Sparta honored the gods after victory with no sacrifices except that of a cock.8 Not even their great triumph at Mantineia called 1 v, i6, 4. 2 V, i6, 5. 3 See Cornford in Miss Harrison's Themis, 230. 4 1i. vl, 88 ff.

We are not clearly informed to what deity the cock was offered.2 Perhaps it was not really a sacrifice at all, but some obscure bit of magic.3 If the voucyn-pta d-eveloped from a propitiatory or avertive sacrifice before battle to an offering of thanksgiv- ing after battle, it would present an interesting parallel to the evolution of the paean from a deprecatory or propitiatory hymn before battle to a chant of victory after battle. But the PtKqr irpta I prefer to put with the eVa yyeXta, or thank- offering for good tidings, and derive both from the celebra- tion banquet. In Homer there is no sacrifice for good news. The bringer of good tidings is rewarded, as at Sparta, with a piece of meat or some such trifle and, very significantly, this reward is called euayyeXtov,4 the singular of the term later applied to the sacrifice for good news. In Aristophanes 5 he is crowned for his tidings, as also in Plutarch,6 but in each casc a sacrifice to the gods is added. The sacrifice for good tidings is mentioned both in Aristophanes 7 and in Aeschines.8 It is probably not mere accident that these are public sacri- fices. Private offerings tended to take the form of AvaO?ara, which seem to be derived from the vow; public offerings I believe to have developed rather from the banquet; for in both vtKr?7ppta and ebaryyeXta the feeling of joy regularly found expression in a feast.9 They were originally manifes- tations of joy rather than of gratitude. The Homeric heroes, with their voracious appetite for meat, often sacrificed animals with no ostensible object other than 1 Plut.

The suitors in the palace of Odysseus are continually sacrificing for their feasts,' and the same is true of the heroes in the Greek camp before Troy.2 This is, of course, quite alien to the practices of many other nations3 and probably to earlier notions among the Greeks themselves.4 But in the Homeric poems we are face to face with dietary practices quite non-Hellenic. The problem has perhaps not yet found a satisfactory solution, but evidently such meals are not felt to be specifically religious acts. There are instances in the poems 5 where, after the account of some great success, we might expect specific mention of thank- offering. Sometimes we are told that the Greeks sat down to a banquet,6 and if they do honor Athena or some other deity with a libation, it is only what they would do at any feast, and it does not make of the repast specifically a reli- gious rite, any more than our grace before meat makes our meals religious exercises. But if we were dealing with a state of society where the sacral significance of meat eating had returned to consciousness, or, more probably, had never been obscured, we should find such a celebration banquet viewed as far more of a religious rite than Homer's Greeks evidently considered it. And after the epic period such a celebration, which even in Homer retained, if only in its terminology,7 the notion of sacrifice that in early agricultural communities seems inseparable from the eating of meat, would be felt by the more religiously inclined to be sacrifice, and would be interpreted as a thank-offering for benefits received. Among less religiously minded peoples or individuals, there was a contrary tendency to ignore the sacral aspect. When thank- offerings were decreed with motives puirely political,8 to curry favor with a populace which enjoyed the banquets that inva- riably accompanied them, it was inevitable that the festal 1 Od. xx, 3; XVII, I8O ff.; cf.

The feast is held for the pleasure of man rather than for the honor of God. The logical outcome is seen in the monstrous length of the Roman su.pplicationes when the thanksgiving aspect of that rite became prominent and it became a scene of jollity, prolonged over as much as fifty days in one instance.1 1 Cicero, Phil.
