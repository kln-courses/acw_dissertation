ROLE mechanisms OF A POLITICAL major task of INSTITUTIONS social of urban control, politics AND largely PRO- is cesses in American cities? A major task of urban politics is to coordinate and direct mechanisms of social control, largely directed at the urban poor, in the service of corporate-based interests upon which the urban economy depends. This thesis, which will here be called the social control theory of urban politics, has emerged as a major development in urban studies in the past five years. While the theory has roots in earlier critical writing on the American city, it also breaks with that tradition and deliberately poses a wide-ranging challenge to many of the main trends of contemporary urban political analysis. The purpose of this paper is to examine briefly the main components of the social control theory of urban politics and to assess critically its strengths and weaknesses. "Local government ... is important, less for the issues it decides than for the issues it keeps submerged. Of the issues submerged by the events of the urban crisis, not the least is the more equitable distribution of wealth in America" (Piven, 1974:340). Piven outlines two main themes of social control theory: the political systems of cities function to pre- serve a tenuous order among the lower classes and this control permits a situation that Gamson (1968) has termed "stable unrepresentation" in which dominant urban corporate interests unduly influence the produc- tion, distribution and consumption of goods and services in the city. The urban fiscal crisis, Hill ( 1976 ) writes, "becomes the state budgetary ex- pression of class struggle in a monopoly capitalist society" (p. 34 ) . These themes, derived from Marxist theory and articulated from a holistic perspective on the city, stand in sharp contrast to most scholarly writing on urban politics - even other critical approaches to the subject. It is not enough, the social control school argues, to show that theories of urban pluralism are faulty or that particular public policies are wrong- headed. To be both politically realistic and conceptually fruitful, urban political analysis must begin with the role of the city in the capitalist system. A major goal of the social control school is the development of a theory that, paralleling Marxist theories of the national state, explain how the capital accumulation process is coordinated and protected at 1 Edward E.

Some of the works on this theme surveyed here can be found in journals of Marxist studies such as Kapitalistate or Monthly Review . Politics and Society has also become a forum used by some ur- ban social control theorists. Two recent representative collections are edited by Alcaly and Mermelstein (1977) and Tabb and Sawers (1978). Significantly, representative statements can also be found in collections in which more traditional approaches predominate, such as Walton and Cams (1977), Masotti and Lineberry (1976) and Hawley (1976). The present survey focuses on American contributions and applications to the United States. Detailed treatment of European writers such as Castells (1977), Poulantzas (1973) or Lojkine (1972) is not attempted. Castells' (1976) recent survey of critical American writing on the city (including that of many of the urban social control theorists discussed here) suggests a number of points of contact between European and American studies. Pickvance (1977) and Dunleavy (1977) provide useful overviews of European writings. In contrast to these recent works, most earlier critical writing on the American city that drew on Marxism did so implicitly or to provide philosophical filigrees to studies still acceptably in the liberal tradition. Mills' ( 1946, 1951 ) treatment of urban themes is an example of this style. Typical too are almost all of the many studies of "community power" that focused on issues which might be expected to emerge from a Marxist perspective, though Marxist theory is rarely in evidence (cf. Clelland and Form, 1964; Agger et al., 1964; Bachrach and Baratz, 1970). While the explicitly Marxist approach to social control theories of urban politics is not precisely sui generis, its appearance on the scene represents a sig- nificant change from earlier writing on urban politics. The comparative novelty of the approach provides social control theory with strengths that grow out of the attempt to make a break with the past.2 PERSPECTIVES ON THE CITY One of the strongest elements of the social control theory of urban politics is to be found in its emphasis on the structural interrelationship of political, economic and social components of urban life. This interre- latedness stems from a conception of the city as the unity of all aspects of urban social relations within the matrix of productive forces. As Katznelson (1976) has stated: It is only in the city that the workplace and the community- separated by the development of the factory- are encompassed in one system of social relations. . . . The study of urbanism is synonymous with the study of capitalist social relations, (pp. 215, 216) 2 There are a few studies that may be seen as bridging the gap between the older critical tradition and the newer social control theory. Citlin (1967), Parenti (1970) and Green ( 1970) are examples.</page><page sequence="3">SOCIAL CONTROL THEORIES OF URBAN POLITICS 607 The focus here is on the unity of the city and on the antinomies that exist within that unity, simultaneously supporting it and threatening to shatter it. This view has immediate origins in some of Marx's basic ideas. Bern- stein (1971) summarizes the point succinctly: Marx revealed to us and focused his attention on the "paradox" of human activity in its social forms. For it is man, or rather classes of men, who constantly and continuously create and reinforce the social institutions that pervade human life. . . . And yet these institutions . . . have the consequence of not freeing praxis and creating those conditions which allow for the enjoyment of free individuality, but of enslaving man, de- humanizing and alienating him. (p. 306) The human beings who build to mirror, enhance and justify their social relations and who are also enslaved and alienated by those very relations are the quintessential urbanités. Social control theory thus sees a funda- mental Marxist idea as naturally describing the urban conditions. This view cannot be dismissed as crude economic determinism of urban social relations because social control theory clearly holds that the "paradox" between creative-productive and alienating-dehumanizing forces is prin- cipally reflected in the political life of cities. Mollenkopfs (1975) is a representative view: Of the many institutions which mediate between the economic, accumu- lation-oriented side of urban life and its communal, human need-oriented side, none is more important than politics and the organization of local government, (p. 250) Markusen (1976) holds that "the social expenses needed to maintain social peace (police, health, welfare) are . . . predominantly the domain of local government" (p. 55). Local politics, then, unifies the "command" function of the city. But unlike some non-Marxist organic conceptions, such as Mumforďs (1960), which also depict the city as a prime command center, social control theory insists on a discrete linkage between political structures on the one hand and productive forces and the socio-spatial arrangement of cities on the other. The psycho-cultural factors so important as causes to urbanists such as Mumford are, to the social control theorists, primarily effects. Technological changes, for example, crucial as primary causes for Mumford and other urban historians (e.g. Warner, 1962) are, in social control theory, the products of the creation-dehumanization nexus: The technological innovation process, as Marx originally argued, grows out of struggles over production and profit. Not just the firm's search for comparative advantage over its workforce and their milieu drives the tech- nology innovation process. (Mollenkopf, 1975:268) All of these ideas draw together in considering urban political systems as local expressions of the overall state apparatus of capitalist society. There is much that is salutary in this perspective on the city. Urban life is seen as all of a piece rather than as a jumble of social, economic</page><page sequence="4">6o8 Social Science Quarterly and political fragments. Analytically, social control theory militates against the specialized study of urban problems as "discrete micro-crises of housing, transport, finance and the like" (Katznelson, 1976:215). In the realm of policy analysis, social control theorists are sharply critical of the fragmentation of the city into a multitude of urban ills. This frag- mentation, it is argued, has encouraged the explosion of welfare and other service bureaucracies whose main goals are the depoliticizing of citizen demands and the securing, through interbureaucratic struggle, of a large and growing share of funding ( cf. Piven, 1972; Lipsky and Olson, 1976). Strongly related to these views is a critical assessment of market models of urban political and economic processes which social control theorists see as dominating the non-Marxist approach to urban affairs. Indeed, market (or public choice) models, in terms of their theoretical sophistication as well as the number of disciplinary adherents they have attracted, are seen as the primary opposing theory. We will refer to "public choice'' and "social control" theories to emphasize this contrast.3 Proponents of social control theory attack urban public choice theory for what the former considers ideological biases that lead public choice theory to "by-pass the urban political struggle" (Katznelson, 1976:215; cf. Castells, 1976:2-4). This attack may be harsh, but politics does often appear to receive a secondary status in public choice conceptions. For example, a typical public choice perspective states: The nature of externalities, public goods, common pools, and natural monopolies creats a need for political organizations to complement mar- kets for allocating goods and services in the economy. (Bish and Nourse, 1975:1388) The above-mentioned place of politics as "complement" to market forces is strongly criticized by social control theory: Market explanations remain essentially circular unless the context in which the market operates is specified. In this case [American urban economies] markets function in the midst of a basic conflict over the direction and purpose of urban life: namely the conflict between urban form for human purposes and urban form for efficient capitalist production. . . . Market explanations deny or mystify the central yet contradictory role of the state. Of all the contextual factors which structure markets, the state is the most important. (Mollenkopf, 1975:294) This critique of market models is rooted in basic Marxist theory: While economists have focused on relations between things . . . Marx has pierced the veil of the market to discover the relations between people. (Hymer and Roosevelt, 1972:22) 3 For a representative summary of the public choice approach to the analysis of urban politics, ses Bish and Nourse (1975), especially chapter 5, "Public Goods and Political Organization" (pp. 109-40).</page><page sequence="5">SOCIAL CONTROL THEORIES OF URBAN POLITICS 609 Such critiques of public choice conceptions are important because they call attention to underlying problems of market models. The ques- tion of individualistic market models versus holistic political-economic models transcends the field of urban affairs and is, in fact, one of the major philosophical problems of contemporary social science.4 It is clear, however, that the methodological individualism and social voluntarism of public choice theory can often lead to an unrealistic picture of the role of politics in allocative decision-making. Corporations and urban govern- ments are not just particular individual "choosers" among man)' other such atomistic actors; nor do social choices occur in a voluntaristic mat- rix where a "no sale" or a failure to "optimize" (or even to "satisfice") have no serious human import. Whether or not the alternatives offered by social control theory ade- quately answer the vexing questions inherent in public choice theory, the formers critique centers attention on the latter's most serious shortcom- ings. The programmatic consequences of public choice theory applied to urban affairs more than amply illustrate these difficulties. As Harvey (1973), a geographer writing from the social control perspective (rara avis) has pointed out, many public policies developed out of the public choice approach that are designed to remedy major urban problems have the character of "bribing" ( Harvey's term ) private institutions to reverse the effects of market forces that are drawing capital out of some central cities. Such programs as rent subsidies may, over the long run, effect only temporary alterations in the pattern of urban investment produced by market forces. Other measures such as limited decentralization may simply shift the locus of market forces to other levels, resulting in little real change (Harvey, 1973:112-13). One need not accept all of the tenets of social control theory in order to use the theory as a critique of urban public policy. As a primarily critical tool, social control theory ap- pears to have much to offer to the field of urban studies. THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE URBAN POLITICAL ECONOMY Social control theory (if the term "theory" is correctly applied) is not just a way of looking at the city or a critique of other perspectives but a way of describing and explaining urban politics. The picture of changes in the contemporary American city offered by the theory can be summa- rized in three major points. First, the overall economic structure of Amer- ican cities is that of a dual economy, reflecting a national condition. Urban economies consist, on the one hand, of large-scale institutions, monopolistic or oligopolistic corporate firms, which provide most of the growth capital and, on the other hand, of smaller, more competitive firms such as retail trades, construction and service businesses. O'Connors 4 See the useful discussion in Harvey (1973), especially pages 50-94. Barry (1970) also provides a valuable survey of this question.</page><page sequence="6">6io Social Science Quarterly (1973) writing, substantially influential in many statements of urban social control theory, is representative of this view. O'Connor actually posits three categories of economic institutions: the monopoly sector, the competitive sector and the state sector in which government itself is a major employer or investor (or both) in the urban economy. The role of the state, at all levels, is overall coordination and protection of the "ac- cumulation" process. The second part of this description of the American urban political economy focuses on changes that have occurred since 1945 and that have fundamentally altered American cities. At least in large, older cities, the past 30 years have seen the decline of manufacturing and an increase in the use of urban centers as sites for clusters of corporate administrations, surrounded by satellite service industries symbiotic to such centralized managerial organization. In general, manufacturing, transportation, com- munications, public utilities, retail and wholesale trades have declined while finance, insurance, real estate, service industries and government (as a direct producer of goods and services on a large scale) have risen. Non-Marxist writers are in general agreement with this analysis but differ in two important respects. First, non-Marxist writers see the growth and decay processes outlined above as relatively isolated, compartmen- talized and uneven. Cities such as Boston, New York, New Orleans, Miami, Houston, Denver, Los Angeles and Seattle are good examples of these changes, but most other large, older cities do not display these trends as clearly (cf. Perloff et al., 1975:123-65). Second, this differential is mainly attributed in non-Marxist work to particular technological changes which, operating in some urban environments, have reduced the amount of direct manufacturing and allied activity and have turned some of them into centers of corporate administration. While the non-Marxist literature emphasizes the role of technological developments, the social control theorists focus on political reasons for these shifts: Relocation of manufacturing establishments outside the tense and danger- ous central city, and the development of politically autonomous sub- urban communities can all be traced back to the capitalist struggle to control the production process. (Mollenkopf, 1975:268) Or, another perspective from social control theory: Like classic colonies, the cities are paradoxes of simultaneous growth and decay. The "fore'gn-owned export sector" continues to grow dynamically, but the rest of the city has become a repository of "native-owned" small capital and a reservoir of cheap labor. (Katznelson, 1976:218)5 The third element in this depiction of the urban scene brings in the 5 Katznelson is referencing O'Connor ( 1973 ) . The analogies by which contempo- rary urban situations are compared to colonial settings are another potentially fruitful contribution of social control theory. The idea is most completely developed in Katz- nelson ( 1973) and Blauner ( 1969).</page><page sequence="7">SOCIAL CONTROL THEORIES OF URBAN POLITICS 6ll manifest political consequences of the other two parts. The political sys- tems of cities that have undergone the changes described above are dependent on the support of growth coalitions dominated by large cor- porate interests (Mollenkopf, 1975:256). The growth of the manage- ment-service sector concentrated in the downtown area necessitates a certain level of control over the city's population, hut the capital develop- ment and control processes themselves "impose tremendous costs on cen- tral city residents" (Mollenkopf, 1975:256-57). These costs have resulted in the urban turmoil of the 1960s and 70s. This unrest threatens further growth and reinforces the need for control: The political terrain within cities . . . has become a terrain of social con- trol that has less and less to do with substantive problem solving and more and more to do with controlling discontent and rebellion. (Katz- nelson, 1976:220) Here the major contention of social control theory is once again stated. It should be clear at this point how the social control idea emerges out of the special perspective and descriptive account of the theory. As noted earlier, there are some strong resemblances between this account and that of non-Marxist analyses, although important differences remain. These differences have significant consequences for the explanatory power of social control theories of urban politics. SOCIAL CONTROL AS EXPLANATION Social control theory, as we have seen, employs Marxist political-eco- nomic concepts to describe major trends in urban affairs over the past few decades. The same concepts are used to create explanations of why urban polities function primarily as social control systems. The term function" is used here deliberately because the explanations produced by social control theory have a strong functionalist cast. This function- alist approach is acknowledged by some writers; for example, Katznelson (1976) states: Much of this work [referring to the development of social control theory] including that of James O'Connor has given content to functionalist ap- proaches by defining "function" with regard to the reproduction of the forces and social relations of capitalist production, (p. 216) The functionalism of social control theory provides a broad brush and a wide canvas on which a didactic picture of urban political life is painted. A major problem arises here, however, with the extent to which urban social control theory depends on and expresses itself in purely functionalist terms. Do the Marxist-functionalist explanations produced by social control theory contain the logical difficulties highlighted by some critiques of functionalism? It will be argued that they do and that these logical problems severely limit the explanatory effectiveness of social control theory.</page><page sequence="8">6i2 Social Science Quarterly An illustration of the problem is provided by Katznelson's (1976) main argument in "The Crisis of the Capitalist City: Urban Politics and Social Control," which is here taken as broadly representative of the pattern of explanation found in urban social control theory. Katznelson argues ( summarizing, in part, points discussed above ) that in some cities corpo- rate manufacturing has declined while corporate headquarters have ex- panded. He further states that the clustering of many corporate head- quarters in the downtown areas of such cities as Boston, New York and San Francisco provides these firms with allied services, a labor pool drawn, in part, from the central city itself ( i.e., office workers and other relatively low-paid personnel) and easy access to the suburban residences of management. These cities have thus become "necessary headquarters cities, but otherwise their traditional economic functions are no longer needed or performed." Katznelson (1976) then argues that "since stability and order are necessary for the smooth ¡Function of downtown headquar- ters, colonial-like dominance within cities now takes the form of efforts to maintain a precarious social peace" (p. 216). Since these efforts in main- taining social control are evident in urban public policy, the influence of corporate interests in the policy process is shown. This argument, dissected in the way, commits in a very bald manner what Hempel (1958) has shown to be the fallacy of affirming the con- sequent. That is, having first argued that corporate headquarters func- tion adequately only if conditions of social peace are maintained in the central city, Katznelson goes on to claim that, since corporate interests directly and indirectly control urban public policy, therefore this influ- ence will produce policies designed primarily to keep the "precarious social peace." Such policies do exist, therefore social control is the main task of urban government in these cities. The problematic nature of this explanatory scheme is further revealed by the frequency with which such phrases as "necessary headquarters cities" and "stability and order are necessary for the smooth functioning of downtown headquarters" are used at crucial explanatory junctures. The form of explanation used here can avoid affirming the consequent by showing that only the social trait "explained" (the controlling in- fluence of urban corporate interests producing social control policies) can accomplish the functional "need" (the "smooth functioning of down- town headquarters"). But why is it necessary that corporate headquar- ters be clustered together in the downtown areas of some older central cities? Why is it necessary that a certain undefined level of social order be maintained for these corporate headquarters to funcťon in a "smooth" manner? What, indeed, are the requisites of "smooth" functioning or corporate organizations that create this functional need in the first place? All of these questions are intrinsic to the type of functional explanation used here but are not answered by the explanation. Rather than showing how certain structural attributes must satisfy particular functional re- quirements, the propositions advanced provide, at most, hypothesized variables which, along with other known and unknown variables, play a</page><page sequence="9">SOCIAL CONTROL THEORIES OF URBAN POLITICS 613 conditional role in producing the political events under study. Addition- ally, as Lehman (1965) has shown, the type of functional explanation used here depends on specification of what terms such as "smooth func- tioning" mean since the adaptive states by which "the reproduction of the forces and social relations of capitalist production" (Katznelson, 1976:216) is accomplished must be calculated from a precise benchmark.6 Mollenkopfs argument parallels Katznelson's quite closely, but with some significant differences. Older central cities are "... a natural loca- tion for markets of information, capital and expertise, and for corporate decision-making" (Mollenkopf, 1975:263), and therefore attract clusters of corporate headquarters. Corporate interests join with governmental actors to form pro-growth coalitions to undertake such projects as the restoration of downtown business districts: These business groups first developed their ideas in camera , subsequently developed a wider business consensus around them, and then ultimately promoted them by various political means, including most especially con- nections with growth-oriented mayors. (Mollenkopf, 1975:274) The social costs of the growth thus engendered result in various forms of citizen protest ranging from riots to neighborhood protests of urban re- newal and other programs. This discontent results in the breakdown of the pro-growth coalitions and a period of malaise in urban public policy marked by a slowdown of urban renewal, shortened tenure of growth- oriented mayors, etc. Mollenkopf (1975:293) is hesitant to state any precise predictions of what will follow this situation, but the fact that "pro-growth coalitions are still at bay" may provide opportunities for continued citizen resistance and perhaps meaningful social change. Mollenkopf's argument is approximately the obverse of Katznelson's. That is, he attempts to show that the failure to maintain a hypothesized level of social order interrupts the corporate-induced process of growth. Although (unlike Katznelson) he offers some quantitative analysis to support his premises, his overall argument is open to the same logical criticisms as the previous one. He fails to show how the responses gen- erated by the political-economic structures he describes necessarily fol- low from the "needs" of those structures, which "needs" can be fulfilled only in certain ways.7 6 Flanigan and Fogelman ( 1967 ) have argued that, in political science, assertions about the existence of structures or processes posed in functionalist terms are seldom expressed in the rigid form into which Hempel translates his understanding of func- tional explanation. If this is the case for much of political science, it is clearly not so for the political scientists and sociologists writing from the perspective of social con- trol theory. The social control analysis discussed here does assert particular func- tionalist reason for the existence of certain structures and processes. For those polit- ical scientists who take a "softer" approach, arguing only that some members of a class of structures and processes are conditionally present as a consequence of the fulfillment of a function, the resultant "explanation" is very weak, useful, as Hempel (1958:289) points out, mainly for heuristic purposes. This problem with the functionalist character of explanation also weakens the main argument of Piven and Cloward's Regulating the Poor (1971), which, while not</page><page sequence="10">6i4 Social Science Quarterly Gordon (1977) presents a similar case. In his treatment of the cluster- ing of corporate headquarters in downtown areas, his conclusion is very close to the ones already discussed: Having already spurred the decentralization of many of their production plants, they [large urban corporations] could now afford to locate their administrative headquarters where it would be most "efficient." (p. 104) At this point, Gordon appears to draw back from saying that this process of headquarters location is determined: There is nothing necessarily destined about central business districts and towering skyscrapers. Those spatial forms develop as the sites for ad- ministrative control functions when power gets very centralized. During the stage of corporate accumulation, power has become very centralized indeed, (p. 104) Leaving aside the ambiguity of the "power" language used here, Gordon's disclaimer turns out not to be such at all. At least for the universe of older industrial cities with which he is concerned, the functional forces are determinate. Gordon thus follows Katznelson and Mollenkopf into a fallacious functional explanation. From another angle, the rather tortuous explanations offered by urban social control theory might be seen as attempts to reconcile classical Marxist theory with the drastically changed circumstances of many present-day American cities. As long as the city was the center of both manufacturing and corporate management, the argument that control of actual or potential discontent was necessary in order to maintain produc- tion seemed to fit closely with Marxist theory. With the departure of a substantial portion of direct manufacturing from some large, older cities, Marxist theories had to look elsewhere for reasons for the predominant social control function of the urban polity. Instead of control to maintain a supply of politically docile labor for manufacturing, social control theory posits policies aimed at protecting clusters of corporate head- quarters. Such "corporate headquarters determinism" would seem to be a much weaker version of the classical Marxist argument. In fact, many corporations have removed their headquarters from older central cities to suburban locations or to newer cities (Burns and Pang, 1977). Then, too, the extent to which urban violence directly threatens corporate head- quarters is questionable. Certainly none of the urban rebellions of the 1960s produced bastille-like assaults on such headquarters. In any event. explicitly addressed to the social control theory of urban politics, is frequently cited in writings on urban social control. The book's subtitle, Tne Functions of Social Wel- fare , is indicative of the functionalist framework of analysis used. This is not to say that Piven and Cloward fail completely to explain the rise and fall of social welfare programs, but rather to say that they suggest partial explanations of the political events they analyze, but not much more than partial explanations. Critics of Regu- lating the Poor have focused on this problem of functional explanation; see, for ex- ample, Muraskin ( 1975 ) for insightful comments on the book and on problems of social control theories in general.</page><page sequence="11">SOCIAL CONTROL THEORIES OF URBAN POLITICS 615 these corporate administrations are not directly dependent on a labor force drawn from the disadvantaged groups in the city. In sum, while a case may be made for the advantages of older central-city business dis- tricts as sites for corporate headquarters, the case has not been made that such locations are in any way necessary, or that the prevention of political discontent is a sine qua non for the development of these firms. The demands of the functionalist explanatory scheme also appear to lead social control theory to endow political elites with a teleological pre- science that exceeds the bounds of credibility. Mollenkopf, for example, resurrects the hoary tale of the "Vault," a group of Boston businessmen who, during the 1950s and 1960s, met informally to discuss matters of common interest. Mollenkopf credits the Vault group with virtually mas- terminding Boston's downtown urban renewal programs - developing, as he has it, the idea in camera and joining with a pro-growth mayor to ensure its implementation. Both former Boston Mayor John F. Collins and Edward J. Logue, the city's redevelopment administrator during the crucial formative years of Boston's renewal efforts, have vigorously de- nied that the Vault played any such pivotal role. Logue, in fact, tells the story of the Vault in exactly the reverse order of Mollenkopf: he states that it was the pro-growth government officials who approached a re- luctant business community for support of urban renewal.8 Even if one discounts Collins' or Logue's version of the role of the Vault, their testi- mony does indicate that the political relationships here were far from complex and far less determinate than Mollenkopf believes. A similar problem occurs in an article by David Gordon (1977) in which he wavers between an anthropomorphic capitalism and properly human but furtive capitalists all seen within a teleological "logic of capitalism:" Capitalism has decreed that those [older] cities are archaic as sites for capitalist production. The process of capital accumulation is leaving them behind. Capitalists have found that they can make higher profits else- where. The logic of capitalism, in this ultimate sense, is at the root of our current problems, (p. 112) QUESTIONS AND PROSPECTS FOR SYNTHESIS It has been argued that reliance on a broad-scale and naïve functional- ism has severely weakened the explanatory power of the social control theory of urban politics. The relationship between the Marxist paradigm and functionalist modes of analysis is a complex and controversial one. Gouldner (1970), for example, has persuasively argued that the indebt- 8 Both Logue and Collins made frequent public statements after their retirement from public office, vigorously denying the alleged controlling influence of the Vault or of any other business group in Boston's urban renewal programs. In a recent commu- nication to the author, Collins ( 1977 ) again asserted that business support for urban renewal was forthcoming only at the initiative of City Hall.</page><page sequence="12">6i6 Social Science Quarterly edness of much contemporary Marxism to functionalism is a major im- pediment to further theoretical progress. There are several other questions that emerge from a close look at the writings on urban social control theory. It is not clear whether these matters are connected to functionalist style, but they are problematic and will be briefly mentioned. The first question that arises is, Why does one find so little quantitative analysis in these writings? At least some aspects of urban political economy that social control theory seeks to illumi- nate-issues of capital and population flows, of the effects of income redistribution policies on the poor, etc.- are directly amenable to quan- titative investigation. Yet the use of quantitative analysis is relatively rare and, when it is present, is usually on the order of simple tabular presentation of aggregate statistical data (Mollenkopf [1975] is typical). Students of urban social control theory need not adopt the presupposi- tions of mainstream economics or of "quantitative" political science in order to benefit from some of the analytical techniques commonly in use in these disciplines. A second question concerns the universe of cities that urban social control theory takes to be relevant. Here, social control theory appears to share a bias with more traditional writings in its virtually exclusive focus on large, older cities. New York City is the archetypal case, and Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Denver, Detroit, Los Angeles, Newark, Phil- adelphia, San Francisco and Washington are among the American cities most frequently used for case studies as well as for explicit and implicit generalizations about "American cities." Neither the political and eco- nomic relationships studied by the social control theory of urban politics nor the effects of those relationships on local, state and national urban public policy can be fully understood if only a few large, older and pre- dominantly northern cities are studied. It may, for example, be the case that the contro! of local government by clusters of corporate interests is more discernable in some of the newer cities of the South and South- west. The recent work of Perry and Watkins ( 1977) has begun to illumi- nate this important question, but much more work, comparative and longitudinal in nature, needs to be done. A corollary issue is that of the historical perspective found in urban social control theory. Most writings focus on post-1945 trends and changes. However, as Dawley's (1976) recent study of "the industrial revolution in Lynn" seems to show, there is much value in cultivating a longer historical perspective. Trout's (1977) study of Boston in the De- pression and Thernstrom's (1973) and Knights' (1971) analyses of nine- teenth-century urban poverty are examples of other works that could provide additional resources for social control study. Finally, it must be noted that the social control theory of urban politics is an "outsiders" theory, politically and academically. Its practitioners tend to be what Horowitz (1968) has termed disciplinary "marginals" as opposed to disciplinary "mainliners." Of course, social control theory would probably not have developed except at a critical distance from the mainstream of the discipline. But this outsider stance too often leads</page><page sequence="13">SOCIAL CONTROL THEORIES OF URBAN POLITICS 617 to a passing over of points of contact - both methodological and substan- tive - with more traditional approaches that could work to the advantage of both schools. One example of such a potential meeting-ground can be found in the more recent work of Long. Long (1972) has argued persuasively that an analytical stance based on methodological individualism can retain a concern with the crucial idea of community in a city, and can be sensi- tive to class patterns and other political-economic variables. Long's ac- count of drift and decay in American urban society, his critical assess- ment of "local bourgeois democracy," is every bit as stark and pessimistic as that found in social control theory. His prescription for political struggle through which community is rebuilt is neither naïve nor merely ameliorative. Cities, he argues, have potentially powerful political re- sources that grow out of the very forms of complex organization by which modern cities are created and maintained. If, as has been suggested, the functionalist holism s of urban social con- trol theory poses as many difficulties as it does benefits, then further development of a hybrid such as Longs may point the way to an alter- native to the cumbersome and mystifying teleology of social control theory and the abstracted empiricism of public choice theory. Of course, Longs work has its drawbacks that suggest such hybrid approaches are not easy to achieve. If social control theory tends to drown in its own theoretical stew, Long's work provides few directives for theorizing. A similar hybrid can be seen in the concept of "privatism" used by Warner (1962, 1968, 1972). Warner s idea, developed in studies of Boston and Philadelphia and in a survey of American urban history, turns the market model back on itself. As with Long, Warner's studies attempt to do justice to the complexity of causes and effects by conjoining method- ological individualism with holistic intellectual goals. Through the mar- ket forces of privatism, the 22,500 new dwellings of Roxbury, West Rox- bury and Dorchester were the product of separate decisions made by 9,000 individual builders" (Warner, 1962:153). This account leads, in turn, to the conclusion that reliance on private organizations and private wealth as the basic mode of social organization in the metropolis produced the notorious failing of the modern American city. Thousands of families lived below an adequate level of food, clothing, housing and employment in a metropolis of un- precedented wealth and productivity. (Warner, 1968:202) The concept of privatism has already produced discussions on the in- fluence of business elites on local public policy that are similar in focus to those of social control theory (Barnekov and Rich, 1977). A method and style of inquiry that avoids the problematic functional- ism of urban social control theory while adopting and developing its critical humanistic perspective on the city would benefit traditional (or mainstream) urban analysis as well as move social control theory onto more viable paths. Drawing back from its more Manichean tendencies, social control theory can continue to deepen our understanding of the</page><page sequence="14">6i8 Social Science Quarterly processes of political and economic control over urban life. Sparked by the critical impulses of social control theory, mainstream urban political studies may achieve greater relevance for public policy. In sum, one can agree with Masotti and Lineberry ( 1976 ) that "a full- blown Marxist perspective is hardly a sine qua non for concern with those issues [of political economy]; the city in either a capitalist or a socialist state functions as a mechanism of social control and as an eco- nomic device for distributing goods and services to social groupings" (p. 7). In the same way, a full-blown commitment to the formalism of pub- lic choice theory is not a requisite for the application of its analytical perspectives. It is a major contribution of urban social control theory that the idea of social controls is a starting point for analysis. Moreover, the comprehensive outlook of social control theory may mean that it is more amenable to enrichment from other approaches than more narrow and formal investigative techniques. A continuing danger is that the rush to embrace the relevant elements of the Marxist paradigm will stifle the syncretism necessary for theoretical development. If the theory is to be more than a disciplinary gadfly, especially if it is to redeem its humanism and its normative concerns, a self-critical examination of its own roots and limitations is in order.
