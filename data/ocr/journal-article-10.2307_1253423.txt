<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BINDING OF A GOD: A STUDY OF THE BASIS OF IDOLATRY. BY WILLIAM CROOKE, B.A. (Read at Meeting of 29th June, I897.) To one like myself, who has spent a large part of his life among an idol-worshipping people, there is something extremely fascinating in attempting to discover some of the leading principles which underlie this class of beliefs. Though my subject this evening is more immediately con- cerned with savage ritual, it is I venture to think, as most discussions on ritual can hardly fail to be, closely connected with some of those folk-beliefs which it is the special pro- vince of this Society to investigate. Since the publication of Dr. Robertson Smith's epoch- making book, The Religion of the Semites, the steps by which the development of the idol from the rudest begin- nings up to the stage at which it attains its highest artistic beauty, as we find it in Greek art, have passed almost beyond the range of controversy. The process begins with a theophany-the appearance of the god to some favoured worshipper at some special spot. To this place the constant presence or occasional visits of the deity to bless and protect his votaries can be secured only by fitting suit and service. Here accordingly they slay and eat the sacred totem animal of the tribe, and secure communion with the divinity by pouring the blood on a pile of rude stones, the most primitive altar, which is later on replaced by a pillar marking more distinctly the holiness of the spot. This primitive unhewn monolith, as the progress to a more anthropomorphic conception of the godhead develops, comes to be carved in the semblance of the deity, and we thus reach the stage of the rude wooden idol or ~oavov, which Pausanias saw in so many of the</page><page sequence="2">The Binding of a God. Greek shrines of his day; and this by-and-by develops into the idol statue of the highest artistic type. Thus in India we find the early ritual prescribing that the altar for the reception of the Soma was to be constructed in the form of a woman.l So in Greece, to quote Mr. Farnell,2 " at the earliest stages of iconism of which literature and the monuments have left record, we find the form of the god darkly emerging from the inorganic block, the Xi0oo ~eo0ro9, but the features of the embryo form are human;" and he goes on to say: "It concerns the history of the people's religion to know in what way the image was regarded. Was it merely a symbol bringing home to the senses the invisible and re- mote divinity ? Probably this was never the popular view, nor was it original. We may believe that for the early and cultivated Greek, as for all less advanced peoples, 'the nature and power of the divinity were there in the image.' It is hard, indeed, to find any passage that establishes the exact iden- tity of the deity and the image in ancient belief, but many show the view that the statue was in the most intimate sense the shrine, or the eSo?, of the divinity, and often animated by its presence." It is certainly remarkable that, as far as I am aware, no distinct statement in the classical literature of Greece or Rome points to the adoption of any definite method of in- fusing the divinity into the image which expressed and re- presented its attributes. That some idea of the necessity of such procedure was at one time recognised may perhaps be inferred from the facts that the Greeks had a technical term, i'tppvat, which is applied by Dionysius of Halicarnassus3 to the inauguration of the o6avov, or wooden statue; but of the exact ritual no details, so far as I am aware, survive. We may, however, perhaps guess that the ritual followed the Eggeling, Satapatha Brdhmana, S. B. E., vol. xii. pp. 62, 63. 2 Cults ofthe Greek States, vol. i. p. 20. 8 Hist., ii. 18. 326</page><page sequence="3">The Binding of a God. lines by which both in Greece and Rome the demarcation of the rE'kevoO or templum, the spot sanctified by the theo- phany, was effected by the augurs and pontiffs. Until the actual presence of the god was thus secured, the spot did not in Rome rise to the dignity of a templum, but received the less holy title of sacrum, sacrarium, or sacellum. We are fortunately not without information on the sub- ject drawn from the usages of other people. This I venture to bring before you this evening, more particularly because I think that the principles which underlie this branch of ritual go some way to explain other observances, and more particularly one of the most remarkable and obscure legends in the Iliad of Homer. I will therefore first ask you to consider the early Hindu ritual which is given in chapter 265 of the Matsya Purana. For a hitherto unpublished version of this remarkable pas- sage I am indebted to the courtesy of Mr. C. H. Tawney, C.I.E., the learned librarian of the India Office, of whose services to the cause of folklore in the translation of the Kathd Sarit Sdgara I need not remind any members of this Society. The present recension of this Purana can be traced back to about the eighth century A.D. But both Mr. Tawney and Professor Weber agree that it has pre- served much of the primitive ritual of the early Hindu writings; and this, indeed, is sufficiently obvious from its contents. After describing some preliminary rites the author goes on: "But after he has deposited the various objects with Mantras (spells) let him anoint the cavity with milk and diligently cover it over with a white cloth. Then having raised up the mighty god, let him place him in the splendid desired place, over the cavity, with the Mantra ' Heaven is firm, the earth is firm, the mountains are firm, firm is the king of subjects.' Then, having placed the god firmly, he should place his hand on his head and meditate with the utmost piety on the undivided god of gods, and should mut- 327</page><page sequence="4">The Binding of a God. ter the Devavrata hymn and the Soma hymn and the Rudra hymn, and having made himself like Siva adorned in the many ornaments, he should in meditation call up the form of whatever god he may be setting up, thus: 'Having be- come a god, I set up the mighty god Vishnu, resembling the flower of the flax, bearing the conch, discus, and club. I set up Siva Trilochana, the three-eyed and ten-armed, having the half-moon for his crest, lord of Ganas, seated on a bull. I set up Brahma, praised of hermits, the four- faced god wearing the twisted locks, great-armed, sprung from the lotus. I set up the Sun, thousand-rayed, calm, accompanied by bands of Apsarases, lotus-handed, great- armed.' " In the same way he should utter Mantras referring to gods, to Siva when setting up Siva, to Vishnu when setting up Vishnu, to Brahma when setting up Brahma. And wise men should utter Mantras referring to Surya, the Sun, when setting him up, and in the case of the other gods the Man- tras referring to them. But since the establishment of gods with Mantras gives joy, whatever god he sets up he should make him the chief, and should remember the other gods standing at his side as attendants." Then follows the prayer: "Approach, revered one, be merciful, be gracious, be everlasting! Receive, revered one, this holy water for the feet, this for rinsing the mouth, this seat over which the holy words have been spoken. Hail!" Then the person dedicating the image is directed to have it bathed with curds and ghi, with a declaration that the day is a holiday, and with the salutary recital of sacred words. He should not move the god after he is set up, otherwise he will be guilty of sin. And he should fill up all the chinks in the pedestal of the image with sand-I sup- pose, with an idea that no evil spirit may take up its quarters in the neighbourhood of the image. The ritual ends with the solemn injunction: "This erecting of a god is not to be performed by an immoral 328</page><page sequence="5">The Bindzng of a God. man, or by a deceitful man, or by a hypocrite. It is to be done by a Brahman who has mastered the Vedas, and is always engaged in the duties of a householder. But whoever out of partiality appoints a heretic as religious superior at the setting up of gods and like ceremonies, passing over Brahmans well-read in the Veda and moral, in that quarter there will soon be a dishonourable ruin of the family, or the place will be occupied by evil spirits, or it will soon cease to be a place of worship, becoming a source of grief to the founder. But that image which has been erected by Brah- mans will bring prosperity to the family, and will be an object of worship for many a year." We may go on to the ritual now practised in Bombay as described by Mr. J. M. Campbell.1 The first stage is that a booth is erected and the sacred fire installed. The chief worshipper takes water in his hand and says: " I consecrate this image of Rama (or whatever deity it may be intended to represent) in order that the deity may come and reside in it." The water he throws on the ground. Then the image is bathed, while butter and sesamum, both holy things, are scattered on the sacred fire. The officiant next touches the chest and head of the image and says, "I welcome thee, Visvarupa," or the representative of the general divine pantheon. After making various offerings before the image, he takes a small golden stick, the magic wand which is so efficacious throughout the whole range of folk- lore, and dips it in honey, a mystic substance, being pro- duced by bees, which are vehicles of the souls of the departed, and applies it to the eyes of the image, and, lastly, dipping the wand in lampblack, he marks the eyes of the image with it, thus adopting one of the most common oriental prophylactics for resisting fascination, which does not spare even the gods themselves. The same object, that of repelling demonic influence, is effected by holding ' Notes on the Spirit Basis of Belief and Custom, p. 363, sqq. 329</page><page sequence="6">330 The Binding of a God. a mirror before the image and offering to it the shadow of various dainties, which are then waved round the image on a leaf of the sacred Pipal tree, and given to an officiant to place at the cross roads as an offering to the evil spirits which habitually haunt such places. Another offering is placed in a hollow bamboo for Siva, who is lord of demons. The next step is to make the image the common abiding- place of all the great guardian deities, who are each invoked with their appropriate Mantras or spells, and with each verse the officiant touches in order the hands, knees, waist, chest, navel, eyes, and head of the image in which the deities are thus invited to take up their abode. The image being thus occupied by the divine pantheon, is laid to rest. All this is preliminary to the installation in the image of the special deity in whose honour it has been erected. This is done next morning in much the same way by the recital of mystic verses and formulae of ritual. As the officiant touches each member of the image, he touches his own person in the same way, thus implying that he too is pos- sessed of the god, which from him is transferred to the image. Lastly, putting his thumb on the chest of the image, he says: "Let the divine spirit or life come into this image: let the divine essence enter into it." He then repeats the Gayatri, the most sacred of all spells, into the right ear of the image, and with the recital of other appropriate texts he touches the feet, navel, and head of the image. When all this is done, supposing that the god has now taken up his abode therein, he bows and says: "0 god of gods! Thou art welcome! Thou hast come here through my good fortune ! Therefore out of kindness to thy devotee thou shouldest abide in this image as long as the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are in existence." Now it is obvious that we have here reached a very advanced stage of ritual observance. But something much more primitive, which may be the basis of the rites which</page><page sequence="7">The Bindzng of a God. 331 we have been considering, is found among the Dravidian or non-Aryan races. I was once some years ago fortunate enough to be present at the actual birth of a local god in a low-caste village hid- den away in the jungles of Gorakhpur, in Northern India. What I saw was in this wise. I had been trying a very intricate case of murder. A man was accused of killing his own child in order to make its ghost " sit on the head," as the Indian phrase runs, of the usurer who was engaged in enforcing a decree against him. To get at the root of the matter it was necessary for me to visit the scene of the murder, and when I arrived there I found that, since the killing of the child a few days before, its ghost had begun to make itself unpleasant. More than one case of sudden illness of man and beast and unlucky accident were confid- ently attributed to its malignity, and that day it had been found necessary to call in the aid of the Ojha, or " Cunning Man," of the neighbourhood, to lay the ghost. This was how he did it. He rang his bell to summon all the vagrant ghosts of the neighbourhood together. Every Indian village has, besides its respectable, established ghosts who are " on the foundation," a number of others who are on their promotion, which may or may not, as circumstances occur, be provided with an image, a shrine, and a priest. They are exactly analogous to the Jinn of Semitic lands, whom Dr. Robertson Smith calls " gods without worship- pers;" and he adds that "a god who loses his worshippers goes back to the clan from which he came, as a being of vague and indeterminate powers, who, having no personal relations to men, is on the whole to be regarded as an enemy." When all these evil spirits, one or other of whom was certainly responsible for the unpleasantness which it was the business of the exorcisor to remove, had assembled, he ' Religion of the Semites, p. 14.</page><page sequence="8">The Bindzng of a God. fell into a state of afflatus, rolled on the ground, and became in popular belief obviously possessed of the spirit. By-and- by he rose and grasped with his hands at the spirits which were supposed to be buzzing round his head like so many flies. He began to herd them together by flapping round his head a switch composed of branches of the sacred Nim and Pipal trees; then when he had got them together, he seized a handful of the mystic grain, black sesamum, waved it round his head, and with a shout of triumph gave his audience to understand that the spirit or spirits were now safely enclosed in it. The sesamum which had thus become the abiding-place of the ghosts he poured without delay into a hole in a log of the sacred fig-tree which lay ready near him. The hole was at once luted over with a mixture of clay and cow-dung, and it was removed to the general village-shrine where the pantheon of guardian gods -Mother Earth, the Snake gods, and their brethren-per- manently rest. Beneath this platform the new candidate for enrolment in the heavenly host was solemnly interred, and he was thus regularly " established," the inference being that if duly approached or fitly worshipped in season, he would abandon his habits of niischief and become a re- spectable, propitious protector of the village and its people. I need hardly remind you of the numerous instances of similar practices of capturing souls among other savage races. We have many cases of an attempt to capture the soul of a dying man, of the enclosure of such souls in cala- bashes. The Dyaks try to capture the soul of the rice which is to revivify the next crop.l Now it seems pretty obvious that in the proceedings of this Dravidian exorcisor we have the origin of the more elaborate Brahmanical ritual which I have described, and Ling Roth, The Natives of Sarawak, vol. i. pp. 27I, 273, 279, 281, 413; Jevons, Introduction to History of Religion, p. 50; Frazer, GQZden uo.ugh, vol. i. p. 139. 332</page><page sequence="9">The Binding of a God. 333 which is technically known asPrdna-pratistha, "the infusing of the divine life or soul into the image." It would not be difficult to collect examples of similar practices in other lands. Thus, in Mexico, in the month Chen, " they worked in fear and trembling making new idols. And when they were finished, those for whom they were made gave presents of the best they had to those who had modelled and carved them. The idols were then carried from the building in which they had been made to a cabin made of leaves, where the priest blessed them with much solemnity and many fervent prayers, the artists having previously cleansed themselves from the grease with which they had been besmeared, as a sign of fasting during the time that they had remained at work. Having then driven out the evil spirit and burned the sacred incense, the newly- made images were placed in a basket enveloped in a linen cloth and delivered to their owners, who received them with every mark of respect and devotion. The priest then ad- dressed the idol-makers for a few moments on the excel- lence and importance of their profession, and on the danger which they would incur by neglecting the rules of abstinence while doing such sacred work. Finally, all partook of an abundant feast, and made amends for their long fast by in- dulging freely in wine." 1 The same train of ideas seems to meet us in some of the Norse legends, as, for instance, in the tale of the image of Hrungnir with the stone heart, and that of M6ckrkalfi, which was made of loam and had a mare's heart put into it.2 We see it again in the Indian account of the preparation of the statue of Jaggannath. According to the account given by Colonel Phipps,3 at the festival of the Ch&amp;nd Jatra the idol is said Bancroft, Native Races of the Pacific States of North America, vol. ii. p. 690. 2 Grimm, Teutonic Mythology, Stallybrass, trans., vol. ii. p. 792, note 3. s Missionary Register, I824, pp. 574 sqq.

When two new moons occur in the month of Asarh, which is said to happen once in seventeen years, a new idol is made. A trunk of a Nim tree, on which no crow or carrion bird has ever perched, is sought for in the jungle. This is known to the initiated by certain signs, and is roughly worked up by carpenters and made over to the priests, who work in secrecy. One man is selected to take out of the old idol a box which contains the spirit, or by another account the bones, of the god Krishna, and this is carefully conveyed into the new image. The man who does this is always removed from the world before the end of the year, a fact which possibly embodies a tradition of actual human sacrifice at the inauguration of the new image. We meet, again, with analogous cases in the observances whereby an abiding-place is made for the soul of a dead re- lation. The Hindus, for instance, fix up near a tank a stalk of a special kind of reed, in which the soul takes up its abode during the funeral rites. So in New Ireland, "when a mem- ber of a family dies, one of the relations visits the bush tribes of the Rossel Mountains, from whom he procures a carved chalk figure representing a man or woman, according to the sex of the deceased, which is intended as an abiding-place of the ghost of the dead. Having procured this sacred effigy, he returns to the village and delivers it to the chief, who places it in a funeral hut erected in the centre of a large tabu house which is decorated with a variety of plants, and having thus assigned a place of repose to the ghostly ogre, the surviving relations think themselves protected against its malicious designs of haunting the abode of the living."' Another interesting series of beliefs based on an analogous principle is found in the customs of burial by effigy. Thus " when a Chinaman dies in battle or at a distance from home, and his body cannot be obtained, an effigy of paper or wood Powell, Wanderings in a Wild Country, p. 249. 334</page><page sequence="11">The Bznding of a God. is made, his soul is summoned to enter it, and it is then buried by his family with all the usual obsequies, as if it were his body." 1 I have elsewhere illustrated a series of similar practices of the Hindus in connection with the formation of a new body for the soul by the performance of the Sraddha rites.2 A modification of the method of infusing life into an idol appears in China. When the idols are ready the rite of " lighting the eyes " is done; expression is given to the eyes of the freshly painted idols, which have been pur- posely left blank by the painter. Up to that time they are not supposed to be animated by the presence of the deity; so a dab of ink is made on the ancestral tablet which gives the spirit power to remain close at hand.3 As a corollary to this method of infusing the deity into an image, it naturally follows that it can be removed by the same means. Thus, Sir R. Burton, shortly after his arrival at Dahome, tells how when he entered his quarters, "two fetish youths made their appearance in the evening, knelt down before the domestic altar, prayed, broke some of the images, and went away declaring that they had called out the fetish, and that I might after the evocatio deorum do my worst."4 It also follows that the image, having been thus imbued with the godhead, has the powers of volition and movement. Thus, to quote Mr. Grote in connection with Greek worship:5 "A Grecian temple was not simply a place of worship, but the actual dwelling-place of a god, who was believed to be introduced by the solemn dedicatory ceremony, and whom the imagination of the people identified in the most intimate manner with his statue. The presence or removal of the statue was considered as identical with that of the being re- presented, and while the statue was solemnly washed, dressed, Gray, China, vol. i. p. 295. 2 Popular Religion and Folklore of Northern India, vol. ii. p. 58. 3 Giles, Strange Stories from a Chinese Studio, vol. ii. p. 224. 4 Mission to Gelele, vol. i. p. 299.

At perilous or critical moments the statue was affirmed to have sweated, to have wept, to have closed its eyes, or brandished the spear in its hands, in token of sympathy or indignation." It would be easy to collect examples of images which possess the power of volition and motion. Thus, when the great iconoclast Aurangzeb attacked Mathura, the idol of Kesava Deva was removed into Rajputana, and when it arrived at what is now Nathdwara the wheels of the chariot stuck in the sand and the idol refused to move farther; so it has remained there to this day.l Lucian tells of a statue by Demetrios which used to play strange antics. The god used to leave his pedestal at night and wander about the house; people often met him, and the splashing of water was heard when he was taking his bath.2 Herodotus describes how the Athenians tried to get back their old images from Egina; but they were unable to wrench them from their pedestals with ropes, and being terrified with thunder and an earthquake sent to punish their sacrilege, they were seized with madness and fell one on the other.3 We have a cycle of tales telling how a man put a ring on the finger of a statue which bends its finger and refuses to restore it ;4 of images turning round, walking, speaking, con- Growse, Mathura, p.

It has been versified, not only by Moore, but by William Morris in The Earthly Paradise. M. Sebillot (Revue des Trad. Pop. vol. ii. p. 20) cites Bibl. Jacob for a similar story, the scene of which is laid in "the cathedral of Paris, towards 170," and the image, instead of being that of the impure goddess, Venus, is that of Our Lady I 336</page><page sequence="13">The Binding of a God. 337 ferring gifts on suppliants, and so on.' The same tales, it is needless to say, were told in connection with many images of later times, holy roods, the relics of saints, and the like. Hence in some cases images were temporarily lent, and conveyed their virtues to their possessors for the time. Thus, in time of trouble the .Eginetans lent to the Thebans the images of the AEakidae, and they were sent to help the Greeks at the battle of Salamis.2 The Spartans did the same with the Tyndarides, and the Thebans lent their hero Melanippus to Kleisthenes of Sikyon.3 It is a belief of this kind which accounts for the common habit of carrying images in procession. Thus the Agurtai, priests of Isis, used to carry about images of their god. At the Apollonia rite in Sikyon the statues of Apollo and Artemis were carried from the tem- ple of Peitho to that of Apollo.4 The Egyptian priests at Papremis carried about an idol, which Herodotus identified with Ares, in a small wooden temple gilded all over, which was drawn on a wheeled carriage which must have been much the same as the tabernacle of Moloch.5 So with the Indian Jaggannath and Krishna, and the procession of the spear of Kandaswami in Ceylon, or Ghazi Miyan in Northern India.6 Similarly in Germany Nerthus, Berecynthia,and Fro travelled all over the country and conveyed their blessed influence to every place they visited.7 Moore read the story in Fromman Upon Fascination, a German work, where it is quoted from Vincent of Beauvais. It is a commonplace of medieval chronicles.

Ac- cording to Athenaeus,l Admete was a priestess of Hera at Argos, but fled with the image of the goddess to Samos. Pirates were engaged by the Argives to bring the image back; but they failed, because the ship laden with the idol could not be made to move. So they took it back to Samos, where it was tied to a tree (obviously it was originally a tree deity), and was finally purified and restored to the Samos temple. Many tales like this are told all the world over, from the Rollright Stones on the Cotswold Hills to the Lingam of MahAdeva RAvaneswara at Vaidyanatha in Bengal, which refused to move when Ravana touched it, and has remained there ever since.2 When the god has thus been established in an image, it is obviously necessary, to prevent him from escaping, to keep him under control, so that he may not only be always at hand to receive the prayers and offerings of liis subjects, but may not abscond or be removed, and thus come under the control of a strange and presumably hostile tribe. It may be objected that this view of the relations of man to his god is inconsistent with those which prevailed in the most primitive times between humanity and divinity, where the deity was regarded not with fear but with love, and early religion principally occupied itself with the task of estab- lishing communion with him. Thus in Dr. Jevons' masterly Introduction to the History of Relzion,3 he writes: " If we regard these fire-festivals and water-rites as pieces of sympathetic magic, they are clear instances in which man imagines himself able to constrain the gods to subserve his own ends Now this vain imagination is not merely non- religious, but anti-religious; and it is difficult to see how 1 Deipnos, xv.

It is inconsistent with the abject fear which the savage feels of the super- natural, and which is sometimes supposed to be the origin of religion; and it is inconsistent with that sense of man's dependence on a superior being which is a real element in religion." At the same time, whatever may have been the feeling of early man, it would not be difficult to quote instances pointing in a different direction. I can only glance in passing at some of this evidence. Thus, the Egyptians not only called on the god by name, but if he refused to appear they threatened him. These formulae of compulsion of the gods were called by the Greeks 0e&amp;ov avaKat-a.l So Dr. Griffis tells us that, as the Italian peasant scolds or beats his bambino, so the Japan fetish is punished or not allowed to know what is going on by being covered up or hidden away.2 Herodotus tells us of the Getae that when it lightens or thunders they aim their arrows at the sky, uttering threats against the gods. And again of the Atarantians, who, when the sun rises high in the heavens, curse him and load him with reproaches because he burns and wastes both their country and them- selves.3 Porphyry relates that the Egyptians were in the habit of using threats, not only to the sacred animals, but even to the gods themselves, " declaring that unless they 1 Lenormant, Chaldean Magic, p. IOI. Dr. Tylor (Primitive Culture, 2nd ed., vol. ii. p. 171) quotes an amusing Chinese case of an action at law brought against a god, who for his fraud was banished from the province. To this Mr. E. S. Hartland adds :-" LElian (Var. Hist., xii. 23) states as an illustration of the boldness of the Celts, that they plunged into the sea and fought the waves. (Cf. The Edinburgh Dinnshenchas, Folk-Lore, vol. iv. p. 488.) This seems to be connected with a superstition, extending from the Basque country to Denmark, of the Three Witch-waves, where the waves, intent on mischief, were really forms of some malignant witch, and only to be conquered by hurling a harpoon or other weapon into them. The harpoon draws the witch's blood, and the waves sink. Mejusine, vol. ii. col. 200; Sebillot, Llgendes de la Mer, vol. i. p. I74." 2 Religions of Japan, p. 27. 8 iv. 94, i84.

S. Burne and Miss G. M. Godden.2 The subject is so important from the point of view of ancient ritual that I may be permitted to add some further illustrations. In this series of ritual observances there seem to be com- bined at least two principles-one to prevent the idol from escaping or being removed; the other, the need of covering up the image, which is tabu, from the sight of its worship- pers, to whom its manifestation might be dangerous. Before dealing with the practices of savages, let me recall to your memory the account given of the matter by a sceptic, who obviously speaks from the point of view of an advanced monotheism. You will remember the account given of the construction of an idol by the author of the Book of Wis- dom,3 the composition of which is fixed by the best autho- rities about 40 A.D. It is clearly the work of a writer of the school of Philo, but of one well acquainted with the idola- tries of his own day. After describing how the image is made and painted with vermilion, a symbol of the blood sacrifice, he says: " And when he hath made a convenient room for it, set it in a wall and made it fast with iron: for he provided for it that it might not fall, knowing that it was unable to help itself: for it is an image and hath need of help." This is plainly a skit at the idols of his time, but the idea of binding up the idol widely prevailed.

Artemis of Ephe- sus, for instance, had artificial arms supported by golden rods. So with Sala, the consort of the Babylonian sun- god, Savitar, Tyr and the Celtic Nuad of the Silver Hand.1 The statues of the maids of the daughter of Mycerinus had no hands.2 The fall of an image was always regarded as ominous, and showed at any rate that the deity who lacked the power to save himself from disgrace could be of little service to his worshippers. We have the case of Dagon of the Philistines, which fell down before the Ark, and suffered much in repute in consequence.3 We come across the same idea at the other end of the world, in New Ireland, where we are told: "Their idols are set up upon lofty eminences. .. . Whenever the image falls to the ground, or is broken or otherwise damaged, it is no longer visited, for as it is unable to keep itself erect, it is supposed that its intercession with Kannua would no longer be of any avail." 4 I may give some examples of the manner in which gods are chained or bound. The statue of the goddess Aphro- dite Morpho, "the goddess of beautiful form," or the bridal deity, had, according to Pausanias, chains on her feet.5 The old tourist tells us that they say that Tyndareus added the fetters " symbolising the bonds of love that unite men so powerfully to women." In the same place he notices an old statue of Enyalius, a form of Ares, and he adds that the opinion of the Lacedaemonians about this statue and that of the Athenians called Nike Apteros, Wingless Victory, is the same-that Enyalius will never depart from the Sayce, Hibbert Lectures, " Babylonian Religion," p. 212. 2 Herodotus, ii. 131. 3 I Samuel v. 3.

Lacedamonians as he is fettered, just as Victory will always remain with the Athenians because she cannot fly away. Pausanias also describes a Wingless Nlke in Olympia, which he says Kalamis made in imitation of the Athenian statue. The best authority on the Athenian monuments, Miss J. E. Harrison,1 dismisses this explana- tion as fanciful. The old Wingless Nike was simply a representation of Athene in one of her forms. Later on, Ntke separated completely from Athene, and the antique wingless statue was deemed anomalous and required a story to account for it. I refer to the case here merely as an illustration of the ideas prevailing in the time of Pausanias, if not much earlier. Wherever we find these chained images the same ex- planation is given-that it is intended to keep them under control. For this reason the Romans fettered the image of Saturnus,2 as they kept the real name of the city of Rome secret that no one might work evil on the city through knowledge of the name. The sacred boulder which marks the theophany of the goddess at Kioto in Japan is honoured by a straw rope wound round it.3 Pausanias tells us of the goddess to whom is given not only the title of Orthia, "but also they call her Lygodesma (bound with willow), because it was found in a willow-bush, and the willow bound about it made the image upright."4 The Mythology and Monuments of Athens, p, 361; and see Farnell, Cults of the Greek States, vol. i. pp. 312 sqq., 338. 2 Jevons-Plutarch, Romane Questions, Intro. lxxx. 3 Palgrave, Ulysses, p. 24I, a reference which I owe to Miss G. M. Godden. I am informed by the Rev. Walter Weston that the custom is common in Japanese Shinto shrines.

" At other times the priests put the idols in irons, chaining their hands and feet. They exhibit them to the people in this humiliating state, into which they tell them they have been brought by rigorous creditors from whom their gods had been obliged in times of trouble to borrow money to supply their wants. They declare that the inexorable creditors refuse to set the god at liberty until the whole sum with interest shall have been paid." When the money is collected "the chains are soon dissolved and the idol restored to liberty." 1 We meet another form of the custom in the case of the Tyrians who chained their stone image of Apollo to the altar of Herakles in order to secure protection for their city.2 This idea of securing a mystic connection by means of a rope or cord is not uncommon.3 Thus Captain Lewin, describing a Buddhistic service, says: " The bowed heads of the postulants were shaven, and through their hands, from man to man, ran a white thread, the two ends of which were held by the priest" as he recited a prayer.4 The practice of passing a cord across a stream to assist the return of the ghost is very common.5 Perhaps the best known case of thus securing contact with the god is that of the Ephesians given by Herodotus.6 "The Ephesians being besieged by Croesus consecrated their city to Diana by fastening a rope from the temple to the wall," a distance of nearly a mile. So the Kylonian suppliants at Athens sought to maintain their contact with Dubois, Manners and Customs of the People of India, p. 299. 2 Curtius, iv. 3, 15. 3 Tylor, Primitive Culture, 2nd ed., vol. i. p. 117; vol. ii. p. 171. 4 Wild Races of S.

The risk of touching or even seeing a sacred object of this kind hardly needs illustration. We have the case of the Hebrew Ark, which it was death for an unini- tiated person to touch.3 Aglauros and Herse, when they saw the chest in which Erectheus was confined, and found the child in the form of a serpent, were seized with mad- ness and threw themselves from the Akropolis. "Gods," says Homer, "are not seen by mortals with impunity," as in the case of Teiresias, who was deprived of sight because he saw Athene in her bath; and when an image of Iphige- neia was found in a bush at Sparta, the sight of it threw the beholders into a state of madness.4 It is needless to Plutarch, Solon, 12. 2 Thucydides, iii.

Hence many gods are kept out of the sight of their wor- shippers, or actually imprisoned. In Mexico, for instance, the image of Quetzalcoatl was "for reverence of his great majesty" kept covered with blankets.l In one of the Aztec temples there was a cage in which the idols of con- quered nations were confined to prevent them from as- sisting their old worshippers in regaining their liberty.2 When an Aztec monarch was dangerously ill, a veil was thrown over the face of his patron god, only to be re- moved when death occurred, the idea presumably being lest the god should not be at hand when his services to relieve the sick man were needed.3 At Dahome the mys- terious god Zan-ku-ku is carried about in a chest, the con- tents of which no one is supposed to know.4 Among the Kurumbas of Madras the idol is kept shut up in a box in a special room and brought out only on the day of the annual festival, and it is prescribed that the holy Salagrgma stone should be kept apart in a shrine between the leaves of the Tulasi or holy basil and wrapt in a clean cloth.5 The two conceptions of tabu and confinement of the god seem to meet in another Mexican case, where the gods were kept hidden in subterranean chambers, "that they might not be disturbed or the people become too familiar with them; another reason was to prevent them being stolen by other villagers." 6 Bancroft, Native Races, vol. iii. p. 260. 2 Ibid., vol. ii. p. 585. 3 Ibid., vol. ii. p. 603. "Masks in stone, wood, and terra-cotta are to be seen in considerable numbers in museums of Mexican antiquities.

The same customs prevailed among the North American Indians. We are told that the principal object in the medi- cine bag is "a kind of household god which is a small carved image about eight inches long. Its first covering is of down, over which a piece of birch-bark is closely tied, and the whole is enveloped in several folds of red and blue cloth."l The Choktaws "kept a kind of box instead of the individual sack, containing some kind of substance which was considered sacred, and kept entirely secret from the common people; and this box was borne by a number of men considered pure and holy." It was never rested on the ground, but on a pure rock or scaffold of wood.2 Similarly in Easter Island the people keep their images packed up in sacks during the whole year, " and each head of a household only exposes to view during the public festivals as many of these toy divinities as he was able to manufacture with his own hands" 3-presumably those over which his influence was most completely assured. Perhaps the most remarkable series of customs such as these comes from the Lower Himalaya in India. In Kumaun, we are told, the goddess Kali used in the old days to climb a deodar or cedar tree near the temple and call people by name-a most dangerous practice I need hardly say. Such unfortunate people used to die next day. But the great religious reformer, Shankar Acharya, put a stop to these im- proper proceedings of the goddess by inverting and fixing a huge cylindrical copper vessel, so as to cover the image en- tirely. Similarly, at Jageswar, the image known as Mrityun- jaya, or Siva, in his form as "conqueror of death," is covered with a cylinder. A massive lid is also thrown over the image of Vimaneswar, or the dwarf Vishnu. As the Hindu Emerson, Indian Myths, p. 248. 2 Ibid., p. 255. s Featherman, Oceano-Melanesians, p. Io8, note.

It is still a horror to swear by touching them."' There are also many instances throughout folklore of imprisoned gods and ghosts. We have the familiar case of the Jinni who was confined under the seal of the Lord Solomon in the bottle of the Arabian Nzghts.2 The same idea appears in Grimm's tale of the "Spirit in the Bottle." 3 Virgilius the mighty sorcerer shut up the fiend in a hole in the mountain; in fact a whole cycle of folktales clusters round the binding of the Evil One.4 There are numerous tales of the shutting up of ghosts and demons in this way.5 For some of the following instances from the folktales I am indebted to the encyclopedic knowledge of Mr. E. Sidney Hartland. A Norse tale given by Dasent from Asbj6rnsen represents the devil as getting into a worm- eaten nut through a worm-hole to gratify a boy's curiosity and being kept there.6 The form of the story universally current in this country seems to be that of ghost-laying, where the ghost is consigned to a bottle or other small North Indian Notes and Queries, vol. iii. p. 148. 2 Burton, Arabian Nights, vol. i. p. 40; Lib. ed. p. 37.

Elias Owen's Welsh Folklore.2 In a curious Rabbinical tale referred to by Southey in The Doctor the demon is, by counsel of a prophet, put into a leaden vessel closed with lead. This is better given in an article by Dr. S. Louis on Palestinian Demonology.3 In the same article there is also a curious tale given to prove that the devil cannot touch anything that has been counted, tied up, or sealed.4 Mr. Hartland adds: "Dasent's tale is given from Camors in the Pays de Vannes,5 where the child had been sold to the devil, and when he came the child persuaded him to turn into a mouse and go into a bag, which he immediately tied up. There is a similar Breton tale, where the hero is a sailor, and the Bosj (some sort of demon) is persuaded to get into a gimlet hole in a tree;6 with which compare Ariel's penance, confined by Sycorax in a cloven pine." 7 In fact the idea is a commonplace of folklore.8 The result then of this discussion so far is that we have gone through a series of cases, the number of which it would not be difficult to enlarge, of the deity being estab- lished in an image. In the more primitive ritual this is actually done in a physical way-the ghost or god is caught, he is shut up in the sacred sesamum grain, which is then enclosed in a piece of holy wood and established in a shrine. In the later form the ritual has been softened down, and the god is only implored or coerced by charms to occupy the ' Hartland, Legend of Perseus, vol. i. p. 206; Folk-Lore Record, vol. ii. p. 176; Folk-LoreJournal, vol. vi. p. 152; Chambers, Book of Days, vol. ii. p. 366. 2 Pages 167, 196, I99, 212 sqq. 3 Proceedings Society of Biblical Archeaology, vol. ix. p. 222. 4 P. 219.

We thus reach the very ultimate basis of the con- ception of the idol. The first idol is a stone erected to mark a theophany; it defines the place where the god has once appeared and will surely appear again, if he be suit- ably approached and his worshippers secure communion with him by eating the totem animal, in other words the god himself, and pouring the blood, which is the life, on the stone where the deity resides. It was no part of the primitive view of sacrifice that the stone should be fashioned in the divine image. That, as well as the devices for con- fining and restraining the god, and those for preventing the tabued imrage from causing injury to its worshippers, were later conceptions. The. special case in ritual to which I have tried to lead up in this survey is that of the famous legend of the im- prisonment of Ares by the sons of Aloeus.1 Dione in the Iliad gives this as one of the cases in which men have brought grievous woe upon the Immortals. " So suffered Ares when Otos and stalwart Ephialtes, sons of Aloeus, bound him in a strong prison-house, yea in a vessel of bronze lay he bound thirteen months. Then might Ares, insatiate of battle, have perished, but that the stepmother of Iliad, v. 385 sqq. As to the other literature of the legend, Mr. Rouse refers me to a version in Apollodorus (i. 7, 4), who says he was trying to storm heaven. The Scholiast to the Iliad says he killed Adonis from jealousy on account of Aphrodite, and adds that when set free he went to Naxos and hid in the at&amp;bpop3pwrts 7rerpa. According to Pausanias (iii. 15, 7) he was chained in Sparta. It may be also noted that this legend in the Iliad is told by Dione, who is quite a shadowy form, perhaps one of the old disestablished goddesses or a double of HIera. If the word repapos is Cyprian, it would, as the Scholiast says, connect the legend with the oriental worship of Adonis. Since this paper was written I have accidentally come across a note by Mr. J. G. Frazer (Classical Review, vol. ii. p. 222) in which the same explanation of the Ares legend is given. He gives an instance of a god of rain, thunder and lightning shut up in New Guinea (Chalmers and Gill, Work and Adven- ture in New Guinea, p. 152) and other instances from the same part of the world (Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-land-en-volkenkunde, dl. xxvii. p. 447, sq.; Bijdragen tot de Taal-land-en-volkenkunde van Neerlandsch Indie, 4de volg., dl. viii. p. 183) sq.</page><page sequence="26">The Bznding of a God. Aloeus' sons, fair Eeriboia, gave tidings to Hermes, and he stole away Ares, already pining, for the grievous prison- house was wearing him out." I quote Dr. Leaf's translation, but the authorities are not quite agreed as to the meaning of the passage. The im- portant words are XaX ce 6'cev Icepalp 8eSezo. Paley says he was shut up in a brass-bound crock. Professor Blackie translates: "Such wrong Mars felt, when the huge-statured Aloidian twain, Otus and Ephialtes, bound him with a tyrannous chain, Twelve months and three in brazen keep he knew the close-barred pain," where he blunders as to the duration of his bondage. Professor Newman says he was bound in " brass and brick," and mentions the chain which bound him. Merivale calls it " a brass-bound barrel." Kepa,Los, according to Liddell and Scott, means "an earthen vessel or wine jar," and, secondly, "a prison or dungeon," to which this passage is referred, the Scholiast alleging this to be a Cyprian use of the word. There seems to have been at Cyprus a prison which was known as the Keramos.1 One sense of the word was undoubtedly a large earthen jar half buried in the earth, such as are to this day used in India and other eastern countries for hold- ing grain. The Indian type-of the vessel could easily hold a man. There was another similar vessel known to the Greeks called a 7rtlOo, and in recent excavations cases of burial in such vessels have been discovered; and the cus- tom prevailed widely in South America. The practice of preserving the ashes of the dead in jars is as old as Homer,2 or even the early Aryans.3 This may have been one basis of the myth. At any rate I conclude that this sense of the word is more primitive than that of " prison:" the under- ' Smith, Dictionary of Antiquities, p. 197. 2 Iliad, xxiii. 243. 9 Schrader, Prehistoric Antiquities, p. 365. 350</page><page sequence="27">The Binding of a God, ground dungeon with a hole above for admitting air and allowing food to be let down to the prisoner would be a secondary meaning. We now come to consider the meaning of this myth. To begin with Professor Max Miiller.1 In his recent book on Mythology he practically gives it up. " Neither his being chained during thirteen months by the Aloeidai nor his being chained by Hephaistos allows us to see any phy- sical background behind the veil of mythology." Preller2 and some other authorities regard it as a story of some early pioneers of civilisation excited by their achievements in the introduction of peace, and thus incurring the wrath of the god of war, whom they finally capture and imprison. But the legend, as we find it in the Iliad, can, I imagine, hardly be detached from its context, in which the suffer- ings wrought by men upon the immortals are detailed. In any case, this kind of aetiological explanations of what is obviously a very ancient myth may reasonably be distrusted. A more hopeful line of investigation might perhaps be found in the supposition that Ares was originally a chthonic or underground deity, a god of vegetation in fact, who dies annually with the winter and revives with the spring, like Adonis, Osiris, Vishnu, and their kindred. And though there are some indications in the Ares myths which may point in this direction, I am not aware that there is as yet complete evidence to support this view of his origin. Further, we find many instances drawn from the ritual of savages in various parts of the world, which illustrate the fact that the jar or pitcher is very commonly used as a receptacle for the god or closely connected with his worship. We have, for instance, the Kalasa or sacred jar of the Hindus, which is, as I have shown elsewhere,3 very generally used Contributions to the Science of Mythology, vol. ii . p. 724. 2 Mythology, vol. i. p. 69. 8 Popular Religion and Folklore of Northern India, vol. i. pp. 97, 255; vol. ii. p. 75; Atkinson, Himalayan Gazetteer, vol. ii. p. 885. 35I</page><page sequence="28">352 The Bznding of a God. in the ritual of the Dravidian tribes. This may be com- pared with the Drona-kalasa of the early Brahmanical ritual, which is the sacred trough in which the Soma was made.' We have, again, the legend of the creation of the sages Agastya and Vasishtha from a jar, whence they obtained the title of Kumbha-yoni or Kumbha-janma, "jar-born." And Manu kept the fish out of which Vishnu was created in a jar. Similar instances are found in Southern India. Thus the deity of the Koramas of Madras consists of five branches of the sacred Nlm tree and a cocoanut, which are kept in a brass pot.2 In the worship of Poturaja, a pot containing the deity when he is enraged is carried in pro- cession to the centre of the village and sacrifices are done to it.3 And in summing up this worship, Dr. Oppert writes: " In the various sacrifices mentioned above repeated allu- sion has been made to the custom of representing the goddess by pots, so that the existence of a special Grama- devata (village god) as pot-goddess need not surprise us. She is called in Tamil Kumbattal, in Sanskrit Kumbha- mata and in Canarese Garigadevara."4 Elsewhere I have given the North Indian legend of the charming of the cholera demon into a jar.5 So in Western Africa Sir R. Burton describes an idol as "a Bo male image, half black, half white, even to the wool, and hung with a necklace of beasts' skulls, with a pair of Satapatha Brdhmatna; S. B. E., vol. xxvi. p. 408. 2 Oppert, Original Inhabitants of Bharatavarsa, p. 198, note. 3 Ibid., pp. 463, 494. To these may be added, as Mr. E. S. Hartland reminds me, the remarkable legend of Lal Beg, which I have recorded else- where (Tribes and Castes of the North-Western Provinces and Oudh, vol. i. p. 266). The Bulgarian sorcerer shuts up a vampire in a bottle which he throws into the fire, and the vampire disappears for ever (Tylor, Primitive Culture, 2nd. ed., vol. ii. p. 193, sq.).

Hoho-zen or twin pots, two little double pipkins of red clay' big pipe-bowls, united like the Siamese twins and covered with whitewashed lids to guard the water-offering." 1 He also describes, in the Dahome worship of the sacred cotton tree, how before it " an inverted pipkin full of cullender holes is placed on the ground at the tree foot, and by its side is a narrow-necked pot, into which the water offering is poured." 2 We meet with a similar example in Egypt. "According to some accounts Canobus was worshipped in Egypt in the shape of a jar with small feet, a thin neck, a swollen body, and a round back. On the Egyptian monuments we find a number of jars with the head either of some animal or human being at the top. It may be that some deities were symbo- lically represented in this manner; but a particular jar-god as worshipped at Canobus is not mentioned by any writer except Rufinus, and is therefore exceedingly doubtful." 3 To this may be added the sacred water jar, the hydria, used in Egypt;4 the mystic double jar which represents the male and female principle worshipped by the Hindus at the Durga-piuj festival; and the Dr&amp;vidian Ghanta-karan, who is worshipped in the form of a jar as the healer of cutaneous disease. I venture then to think, in default of some better expla- nation of the myth which we have been considering, that Otus and Ephialtes may have captured the war-god, shut him up as the Indian exorcisor does the dangerous ghost, and used him for their own purposes until he was released. The "brazen crock," then, in which they " established " the god would be the analogue of the idol into which the Indian exorcisor infuses the spirit of his deity.

Whether Osiris was or was not a tree- or corn-spirit does not affect the matter. But in this version we have what is wanting in the Homeric myth, the sealing up of the receptacle of the spirit, which we find in other forms of the story, as for instance that of the Jinni, who was placed under the seal of the Lord Solomon. This is not to be wondered at, because Homer does not go into details, and merely refers incidentally to the myth, one with which his hearers were doubtless quite familiar. But why was he shut up for thirteen months? If the thirteen months were, as the old Greek months certainly were, lunar, then the period would represent a solar year, and this to my mind is one of the strongest facts which tend to indicate the chthonic origin of the myth. We know that about the time of the compilation of the Homeric poems a change was going on by which the use of the old and rather vague term Evtavro' was being replaced by the more definite 6To?. The former prevails in the Achilleid or more primitive stratum of the epic. In Hesiod (Theog. 59) evtavro means little more than a ten months' cycle, and the same change in the length of the year prevailed among the early Italians. We may possibly find an indication of the same develop- ment in the calendar in the present case. We know that there were many gods whose images were exposed only once a year. This was the case, for instance, with the statue of the Diadumene Mother and that of the secret statues of the Sikyonians, which they used to carry once a year to the temple of Dionysus.l Herodotus tells us of the daughter of Mycerinus, who prayed to her father that he would let her see the sun once a year; and the wooden heifer supposed to contain her body was therefore actually Pausanias, i. 7, 3; ix. 25, 2. 354</page><page sequence="31">The Binding of a God. brought out once a year.' We have the same custom in the Hindu practice of annually bringing out and parading the images of Jaggannath and Krishna. But this rule is not invariable, for the idols in Tahiti are brought out and exposed to the sun every three months.2 One of the great gods of Samoa was Tui Tokelau; " he was supposed to be embodied in a stone which was carefully wrapped up wifh fine mats and never seen by any one but the king, and that only once a year, when the decayed mats were stripped off and thrown away;" no one dared to appropriate the de- cayed mats.3 Lord Roden in his Progress of the Refor- mation in Ireland speaks of a stone idol, called Neevougi, which was wrapped in homespun flannel by an old woman, its priestess. I might add that the principles which we have been con- sidering seem to throw considerable light on the very curious question of the theft of gods-why, for instance, a stolen god is more valuable than one honestly acquired, as the image of Pluto which Ptolemy Soter got stolen,4 and why every old woman will tell you that the best cure for the rheumatics is to steal a potato from a greengrocer's stall. But I fear I have already trespassed too long on your patience, and this with many other questions con- nected with idols must stand aside for the present. 1 ii. 132. 2 Featherman, Oceano-Melanesians, p. 52. 3 Turner, Samoa, p. 268, sq. 4 Plutarch, De Iside, 28. 2A2 355</page></plain_text>
