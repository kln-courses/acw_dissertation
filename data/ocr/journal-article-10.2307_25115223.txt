Plasse 12 Crossover Dreams: Reflections on Shakespeareans and Popular Culture "Crossover Dreams" explores contemporary Shakespearean scholars' relationships to the popular culture of their own time within the framework of the author s autobiographi cal reflections on her own development as a scholar of both Shakespeare and popular cul ture. The essay argues that when Shakespearean scholars engage in the study of popular culture, they may do so in part as a way of responding to the fact that Shakespeare, the primary subject of their teaching and scholarship, is so heavily mediated, so culturally powerful, and ultimately, so elusive. As it examines the author s work on popular culture as a response to, rebellion against, and sometimes an escape from these features of Shakespeare studies, the essay suggests that Shakespeareans turn to the study of popular culture for the pleasure of practicing their scholarly craft in the freer, more playful space of a field of study that is not as densely mediated as Shakespeare studies. Donald K. Hedrick 19 The Bard of Enron: From Shakespeare to Noir Humanism The recent surge of popular appropriations of Shakespeares works for managerial work shops and book-length manuals for the business world foreshadows complex changes in the Bourdieuian "literary field." Analysis of several manuals reveals a trajectory of sophis tication in using Shakespeare, paralleling Nietzsche's categories for uses of history. "Inspirational" manuals merely offer "universal" nuggets of conventional wisdom, on "Estate Managing" or "PR." "Professional managerial" manuals go further in literary style analysis of characters and scenes, praising Petruchio or Claudius for a virtual war against workers and decisive downsizing as the greatest talent. A third kind of manual, one co-written by a CEO and a Shakespeare theater's artistic director, periodically enters "Shakespace," a place for the "transversal" movement of business subjectivity going out side itself. This manual verges on self-critique, acknowledging the increasing ruthlessness and corruption we know from contemporary corporate scandal, fearing corporate "Hamlets" most as potential revenger-terrorists, in effect questioning the morality of the entire corporate enterprise, explicitly described as anti-democratic. A newly implied, par adoxical role for the literary humanist in late capitalism is the complicit investigator, a</page><page sequence="2">film noir detective, perhaps fascinated by and even benefiting from and the commer cial/criminal sphere under investigation, as Shakespeare becomes Los Angeles. Jared Scott Johnson 44 The Propaganda Imperative Challenging Mass Media Representations in McKellan s Richard III In 1995, director Richard Loncraine and actor Ian McKellen collaborated on a project to bring, like Laurence Olivier and others before them, Shakespeare's Richard III to film. In my analysis of McKellen's Richard III, I understand the film both as a continuance of and a reaction to Oliviers Shakespearean film tradition. In contrast to Olivier's stylized, theatrical film, McKellen abandons the Baroque aestheticism that elevated the film to the realm of "high culture." Instead, he assigns Shakespeare to a specific, though anachronis tic, time period and appropriates one of the play's major themes?Richard's manipula tion of the masses?to fit with a twentieth century recasting of the play, thus testing Shakespeare's timelessness. Furthermore, McKellen uses Shakespeare's play to comment on modern-day mass media's influence on contemporary culture. However, at the same time that McKellen issues a warning about the dangers of mass media in the hands of a tyrant, he subtly manipulates the viewer by taking advantage of the very media forms that he critiques, creating witty yet biting irony. Richard J. Hand 60 Shakespeare, Soccer and Spin-Doctors: Staging a Contemporary Henry V Taken as a whole, the history plays are the most neglected of Shakespeare's dramatic works, not least because their animation of "real" history is perceived as potentially alien ating for a contemporary audience. In Henry V, however, we find a play that is a thrilling theatrical journey and the use of the play in production from the Elizabethan period to our own time presents fascinating examples of the use of Shakespeare for purposes of propaganda or satire. The University of Glamorgan Henry V attempted to be a produc tion for the twenty-first century, and used Shakespeare's text to explore contemporary ideological issues and political anxieties. The production design utilized the iconography of sport and familiar images from the news media to develop and explore the regional, national, and global concerns that the script of Shakespeare, himself the greatest adapter in the history of English theater, seems able to facilitate. Marion Perret 72 Not Just Condensation: How Comic Books Interpret Shakespeare Inescapably, comic book versions of Shakespeare's plays not only inform, but also inter pret, verbally and visually, blatantly or subtly. While the medium and audience make adaptation necessary, intelligent cutting can clarify as well as condense, and imaginative artwork can convey some of the play's complexity and depth by suggesting more than is said. Because the reader must actively cooperate in giving a comic book imaginary life, when the artist successfully catalyzes interaction between word and picture, careful look</page><page sequence="3">ing challenges thought. A panel or page from a comic book version of Shakespeare can become an enjoyable means of helping students grasp that a single text may be inter preted several ways, that the text itself is an interpretation, and that the culture of the time or place influences shaping and understanding of the text. Used imaginatively, comic books can help the college student begin to recognize critical problems and theoretical concerns. Annalisa Castaldo 94 "No more yielding than a dream": The Construction of Shakespeare in The Sandman Because Shakespeare does not fulfill the stereotype of the tortured genius, creating art out of suffering, there has been a tendency to mythologize his life, despite documentary evi dence of its calmness. Neil Gaiman's award winning comic, The Sandman, links Shakespeare to the protagonist, Dream, the anthropomorphic essence of the unconscious mind. Dream gives Shakespeare the ability to channel "the great stories" so that they will be remembered throughout the age of man. But Shakespeare discovers that this dream separates him from his life, so that only the work is real. In this way he mirrors Dream, who guides the dreams of every living thing, but does not allow himself any. In the final issue, Dream returns to Shakespeare just as the latter finishes The Tempest, a play about a king who gives up his throne, a play written specifically for Dream, who believes he can never leave his island. Katherine 0. Acheson 111 Hamlet, Synecdoche and History: Teaching the Tropes of "New Remembrance" In the modern university, giving students a historical understanding of the self in relation to the world is most prominently the responsibility of English Studies. Within English Studies, Shakespeare courses are most often called upon to provide this understanding. This situation is ironic, given that the contraction in offerings in other historical areas is due in part to our desire to diversify the sources of knowledge we present, and displace authors such as Shakespeare from the center of the canon. This article argues that, which we must resist, with Elizabeth Hanson, a "synecdochic Shakespeare," we can make good use of Shakespeare's plays to reveal the complexities, structures and problems of histori cism to our students by focusing on the ways in which figurative language works to organize time and meaning. In particular, the essay focuses on synecdoche in Hamlet. Synecdoche?the taking of a part to represent a whole, which has variously been called the trope of" representation" (Burke) and of memory (Baldo)?is one of the more preva lent figures in the play, and is used to express the diverse and unstable structure of his torical understanding throughout. Synecdoche in Hamlet therefore provides a tutorial in the compulsion towards, and challenges of, the formation of historical identities. The essays argues that a pedagogical focus on figurative language is not, contrary to what</page><page sequence="4">might be expected, a diversion from history (as the absence of discussions of the func tions of figurative language from recent, authoritative, collections of essays about teach ing Hamlet and Shakespeare would suggest), but instead a way to open up the histories? of power, gender, the self, for example?which are the subjects and matter of the tropes of new remembrance with which the essay is concerned. Kay H. Smith 135 Hamlet, Part Eight, The Revenge or Sampling Shakespeare in a Postmodern World Hamlet is a prime source for allusions and references, or to use postmodern terms, para texts, or samplings in recent films. Perhaps no other of Shakespeare s plays has been ran sacked for lines, scenes, plot devices, or oblique but telling references as often or as com pletely in films of the last two decades as Hamlet. In these films, of which Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Gildernstern Are Dead is perhaps the fullest example, the text of Hamlet becomes a kind of "raw material" that both has meaning in itself and also derives mean ing from its rearticulation within a new form. This essay examines the effect of such bor rowings from Hamlet and argues that Hamlet can become a problematic literary icon, which disrupts through the contrasts it establishes. Kim Fedderson and J. Michael Richardson 150 Hamlet 9/11: Sound, Noise, and Fury in Almereyda's Hamlet What effects does terrorism's moving warfare "into the symbolic sphere, where defiance, reversion, and one-upmanship are the rule" have on the complex codes through which contemporary cultural artifacts are read? The impact of the terrorist attacks on New York City on September 11, 2001 resonated within the symbolic sphere, setting off a hermeneutic shockwave upon any cultural objects that can be implicated in its emerg ing narrative. Michael Almereyda's Hamlet (released in 2000) is a case in point. We read the film differendy now. The events of September 11, 2001 overwhelm the film's attempt to establish a stable and persistent interpretive framework for itself, and the new, now transfigured, symbolism of the New York cityscape inclines viewers to re-read the film's pervasive paranoia, shifting the locus of this Hamlet from the inner, private, and individual to the outer, public and geo-political.</page></plain_text>
