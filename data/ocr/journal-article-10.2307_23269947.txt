<plain_text><page sequence="1">Global Governance 18 (2012), 149-169 GLOBAL INSIGHTS Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion in Violent Conflict and Peaceful Governance Rama Marti From the Origins of Religion to the Present Impasse Religions emerged in the dawn of prehistory, as ubiquitous, diverse responses of humankind to the bewildering wonderment of our planet. They celebrated the earth's bounty, the sky's gifts, and their fundamental unpredictability. Cos motheandry prevailed: the entire cosmos was inhabited by theos, and deemed divine. Everything in the universe, under one's feet and above one's head, was considered sacred. Both "mother" earth and "father" sky were venerated, their cosmic marriage giving birth to the bountiful universe.1 The inscrutable fertil ity of women and nature was worshipped. It was unthinkable for our early an cestors to be anthropocentric and believe that all of this marvelous creation was for their species' benefit alone, to be used and disposed at whim. It was self-evident to humans then that their species was but one link in this indivis ible chain of life where everything was interconnected, all infinitely different yet seamlessly one. Living in unbroken union with nature, human beings found innumerable geographically specific ways to venerate and entreat the elements. Uncovering nature's secrets, they reaped its generosity. Hunters blessed their prey before felling them for sustenance; gatherers learned when, where, and how to enrich their diets; nomads deciphered the skies to feed their herds; settlers conjugated water and soil to cultivate crops; humans cooperated with animals to multiply the strength of their limbs. Our ancestors found awe-inspiring names to de scribe the forces of nature and the indescribable creative energy behind the uni verse. They whispered stories of creation that became their founding myths.2 Hence, the diverse cultures and civilizations of the world were born. In spired by the unique geography and endowments of each inhabited piece of Earth, the learned devised rituals, replete with wisdom, redolent with symbol ism. As cultures evolved alongside ancient religions, communities devised culturally appropriate ways to manage the affairs of humankind. Their soci eties were not Utopias; violent conflicts rose, but so did ingenious rites to pre vent violence, resolve conflicts, and reconcile enemies. Such cosmotheandric 149</page><page sequence="2">1 50 Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion beliefs and peacemaking traditions continue to prevail among ancient spiritual traditions sheltered from modernization, though they have been largely aban doned by subsequent mainstream religions. Over time, as humans became less nomadic and more sedentary, less bu colic and more urban, religions too sought refuge in built-up structures: tem ples, mosques, churches, and synagogues. Earlier, when humans' umbilical cord to Mother Earth was still vibrant and sensate, the wise knew which geo graphical locations were most replete with electromagnetic energy and con nected subterraneously with myriad other spots on the planet. These were deemed sacred and housed sites of worship. This rock might harbor a church, synagogue, or mosque and that cavern, a stupa or temple: all coexisted as dif ferent notes in the hymn to the divine. With changing politicoreligious for tunes, mosques or churches were built on ruined synagogues and temples, and vice versa; the wise knew these sites were potent, regardless which form of God was worshipped thereon. As walls rose to enshrine the deity, differences grew between diverse manifestations, first unwittingly and then deliberately. Demarcation replaced coexistence. Walls not only bonded those within, but also segregated those within from those without. Soon, the material wealth and temporal power en compassed within became worth defending at any price, against outsiders: in fidels, heathens, enemies. Competing claims arose to being "the chosen people." Thus the lethal rivalry between and within religions sharpened and spewed blood through subsequent centuries. Eminent anthropologists and sociologists have proposed empirical theories of religion's origins that eclipse my humble exposition. For Herbert Spencer, a Darwinian, social evolution underpinned human society and religion originated in ancestor worship. Edward Burnett Tylor coined the term "animism" from the Latin anima (soul), to characterize early religions based on their belief that inanimate objects and animate beings, including humans, have souls or life forces. James Frazer opined that magic was the precursor of religion. Bronis law Malinowski and the functionalist school focused on the interrelations be tween social systems and the people's attitudes: thus, the realm of the sacred was that which inspired awe. Emile Durkheim saw religion as projections of so ciety's social values. Alfred Radcliffe-Brown and Claude Levi-Strauss devel oped the method of structural analysis while Franz Boa proposed historical particularism to explain cultural differences in religions.3 As human society ad vanced with scientific discoveries and greater knowledge of the cosmos, schol ars claimed that religion also evolved, progressing from magic to animism to polytheism, and finally toward its culminating form of monotheism.4 With the Enlightenment and the Reformation, scientific rationality replaced blind faith. Theories of secularization popular in the 1960s-1980s opined that, with modernization, religions lose their purpose and decline.5 Europe was con sidered the precursor for a global evolutionary trend toward secularization or</page><page sequence="3">Rama Mani 151 atheism. Paradoxically, since the 1990s, the world has "desecularized," despite globalization.6 Today, religion seems at once irrelevant and all-important. Although it is challenging to measure faith accurately, Gallup's 2000 AD Millennium Survey of sixty countries representing 1.2 billion people recorded an astounding 87 percent of the world's population as claiming to belong to a religion. Western Europe, presumed secular, recorded 84 percent as belonging to a religious de nomination; 88 percent of recently communist Eastern Europeans said they were religious; and North America's religiosity at 91 percent was surpassed by Latin America (96 percent) and West Africa (99 percent).7 Although Islam is growing rapidly at 21 percent, Christianity remains pre eminent, claiming 33 percent of the world's faithful. The nonreligious, agnos tics, and atheists constitute 14 percent, on par with Hindus. Buddhism, primal indigenous faiths, and Chinese traditional religions claim 6 percent each; Ju daism represents 0.22 percent.8 Different studies vary slightly, but tally overall.9 Decades ago, Europe appeared unequivocally Christian; today only 26 percent of the world's Christians live in Europe while 24 percent live in Latin America, 19 percent in Africa, and 17 percent in Asia. China has 54 million Christians, with rampant evangelization.10 Religion has become a growth in dustry: with "more than 9,000 different religions in the world today, existing in just over 200 recognized nation-states, conflict is inevitable."11 Secularism persists in some countries like Sweden and France, but others have "desecularized" such as postcommunist Eastern and Central Europe.12 Despite secular appearances, the world today is vibrantly religious—or claims to be, with profound consequences for politics, peace, and war. The Contributions of Religion Toward Peace In theory all major and most minor religions cherish peace and justice in their scriptures,13 but in practice they often foment conflict and injustice. Unsur prisingly, religion's nexus with violence has been more exhaustively studied than its nexus with peacebuilding,14 just as media overreport the former and underreport the latter. Nevertheless, to begin with the positive, several reli gious initiatives have fostered peace as the selective examples below illustrate. Despite the intractability of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the frequency of peace initiatives launched by both Jewish and Islamic religious leaders is noteworthy.15 Notably, the World Conference of Rabbis and Imams for Peace initiated in 2005 met symbolically in Seville, Spain, in 2007. Ill-fatedly, the conference declared 2008 as the year of reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians. Meeting in December 2008 at the headquarters of the UN Edu cational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in Paris, as violence flared in Gaza, the delegates declared: "First and foremost, the Imams and Rabbis, joined by the Christians, hereby reiterate their commitment to denouncing</page><page sequence="4">1 52 Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion and condemning henceforth, ceaselessly and publicly, all forms of violence, terror, and individual and collective injustice committed in the name of God and/or their respective religions or Holy Scriptures. They also reiterate their determination to be active custodians of the Sacredness of Peace."16 Although they have not produced peace, the symbolic impact of Arab-Israeli interfaith initiatives and statements is important, albeit unquantifiable, amid today's ac centuated acrimony. Religious initiatives have scored concrete successes in mediating civil wars, notably in Africa. Mozambique was a pathbreaker. The Sant'Egidio Roman Catholic community, with a long, trusted, in-country presence, succeeded in bro kering a peace accord in 1992 between the government of Mozambique and the Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO).17 The Sant'Egidio community was solicited thereafter in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Uganda, Sudan, and elsewhere, and won awards for its peacemaking.18 In violence-racked Acholiland in Uganda, the Acholi Religious Leaders' Peace Initiative, established in Gulu in 1997, brings together Muslim, Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox leaders to prevent and mitigate conflict. It also participated in the Juba peace talks. The initiative won the prestigious Ni wano Peace Prize in 2004.19 In Nigeria, Pastor James Wuye and Imam Muhammad Ashafa in Kaduna were initially enemies in the Christian-Muslim violence. The pastor lost an arm and the imam lost his spiritual guide and relatives in the conflict. They reconciled and forged a partnership to establish the Muslim-Christian Inter faith Mediation Centre that resolves religious conflicts in Nigeria. The film The Imam and the Pastor celebrates their story.20 Sudan's wars not only mobilized Sudanese religious leaders, but also evoked international responses. In March 2010, for instance, an interfaith march on the US Congress was undertaken by prominent Jewish and evangel ical Christian leaders to urge Congress not to forget Darfur.21 The proliferation of endogenous interfaith initiatives in Africa is impres sive. In September 2000 amidst still-raging violence in the African Great Lakes region, Protestant, Catholic, Orthodox, Kimbanguist, and Muslim lead ers from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of Congo convened at a conference and called on the international community to act for peace in their war-wracked region.22 In March 2010, the African Council of Religious Leaders held their Religions for Peace meeting in Kigali, Rwanda, uniting Christian, Muslim and Hindu religious leaders from Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, Kenya, Sudan, Tanzania, and the DRC. Their theme was, "Advanc ing Shared Security: Strengthening Multi-religious Collaboration for Peace Building, Reconciliation and Sustainable Development." The council launched a campaign against arms trade in 2010, urging African leaders to redirect arms budgets toward development.23 The continent presumed most vi olent has been the most prolific in interfaith peacemaking.</page><page sequence="5">Rama Mani 1 53 In my country of origin, India, the Sarva Dharma Sansad (SDS; Parlia ment of Religions) was established in 2007, uniting male and female leaders across all faiths. It jointly campaigns on a seven-point agenda to eliminate re ligious violence, extremism, dogmatism, casteism, and gender discrimina tion.24 Swami Agnivesh, the SDS's convener, is emblematic of India's committed interfaith peace activism, which has grown apace with violent reli gious fundamentalism. For forty years he has campaigned relentlessly against sexist and casteist Hindu religious dogma, helped introduce new legislation, and mobilized leaders of all religions to jointly eliminate religious and sexual violence affecting all faiths, including female foeticide. A visible, outspoken spiritual figure respected for his integrity, he led multidenominational peace missions to Kashmir, as in 2010 when violence peaked, and was nominated in 2010 to be peace mediator between the government and ostensibly atheist (Marxist) Naxalite fighters.25 Although religious fundamentalism is still ram pant in Mahatma Gandhi's India, such initiatives temper violence. Interfaith peace initiatives also thrive internationally. In 1883, the World's Congress of Religions in Chicago unprecedentedly convened Eastern and Western spiritual leaders. In 1988 the Council for the Parliament of World Re ligions was established, with a centennial revival of the Chicago congress, gathering world religious leaders. Meeting every five years in international cities including Cape Town, Barcelona, and Melbourne, its objective is to con tribute toward creating a just peaceful and sustainable world.26 Religions for Peace, founded in 1970, claims to be the "largest interna tional coalition of representatives from the world's great religions dedicated to promoting peace." Its successful interventions list the creation of favorable en vironments in Iraq and Sierra Leone. It holds global assemblies every five years and prioritizes conflict transformation in its multiple initiatives.27 Additionally, summits of religious leaders have convened annually since 2005, just before the Group of 8 summit meetings, to lobby G8 leaders on peace and security.28 Preceding the UN Millennium Summit in September 2000, a Millennium World Peace Summit of Religious and Spiritual Leaders gathered over 2,000 religious leaders, particularly from war zones. The summit's declaration, ad dressed to the UN Secretary-General, affirmed the religious leaders' commit ment to peace and rejection of violence, and delineated regions where religion could help transform conflict. The summit established the World Council of Religious Leaders, whose prestigious personalities support UN peace initia tives.29 The Global Peace Initiative for Women was also established at that time. Five hundred female religious leaders met in 2002 in Geneva, launching an initiative to identify ways that they could contribute to peacebuilding.30 This is a small sampling of innumerable religious initiatives, with varied strategies and success rates, studied elsewhere.31 Inevitably, religious leaders and interfaith initiatives have both strengths and weaknesses as do all peacemakers.32 Nevertheless, they suggest the peacebuilding potential inbuilt in all religions.</page><page sequence="6">154 Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion The Nexus of Religions with Violence Notwithstanding their inherent peacebuilding potential, religions have a strong nexus with violence. The relationship is nuanced and contradictory: a religion may be benevolent and progressive in one area or era, yet oppressive and re gressive in another. "Religion can be a contributing factor in conflict or an in hibitor, and occasionally both at the same time. . . . There are people with no religious faith who use religion for political ends. There are others who see their faith and political action as co-terminous, and yet more who view reli gion (a human construct) and faith (God given) as distinct, preferring private faith to be uncorrupted by politics."33 Clearly, all 10,000 extant religions can not be branded as violent. Few, like Quakers, Baha'i, and Jains, have been consistently pacifist. Many traditional and cosmotheandric religions of Africa, North and South America, Asia, and Oceania still venerate all life-forms, es chew violence, and practice community conflict resolution. The reductionist popular belief that Islam is a uniquely belligerent reli gion requires correction. Islamism's rise from the Muslim Brotherhood in Cairo's A1 Azhar University, to the Iranian revolution, to Afghanistan's Is lamist struggle against Soviet occupation did not preoccupy Western opinion until Samuel Huntington's Clash of Civilizations. The September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States and subsequent events made Huntington's thesis appear as what Abdullahi An-Na'im calls a self-fulfilling prophecy.34 Alfred Stepan, the preeminent scholar of democratization, refutes the allied notion that Islam is inimical to democracy, underlining that over one-half of the world's Muslims live today in democracies.35 Muslim scholars argue that the renaissance of liberal Islamic thinking is overlooked.36 It is not the responsi bility of Muslims alone, but of all politicians and citizens, to overturn this dan gerous stereotype, because Islam is no more or less belligerent than other major religions. As David Smock acknowledges, "No major religion has been exempt from complicity in violent conflict."37 All major and most minor religions have cavorted with violence: in dogma and deed; in rhetoric and practice. The Bible's Old Testament, revered by Christians, Jews, and Muslims, is replete with God's wrath and quasi-genocidal retribution. The sacrosanct Hindu scrip ture, the Bhagavad Gita, transpires on the battlefield of a fratricidal war. Across continents and ages, royal priests sanctified the conquests of kings, whether in Asia, Africa, or the Americas. The church blessed European mer cenaries and missionaries who colonized and proselytized with brute force. Even Buddhism, the religion of nonviolence, has known violence. Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka adopted arms in the war against the Tamil Tigers; the Khmer Rouge genocide occurred in deeply Buddhist Cambodia; and the Burmese military junta crushed the 2007 saffron revolution by Buddhist monks. Mark Juergensmeyer illustrates the ubiquity and heterogeneity of reli gious violence in his research.38</page><page sequence="7">Rama Mani 155 Acute and Chronic Forms of Religious Violence Violence associated with religion manifests in different forms that elude gener alizing presumptions.39 The first form is interreligious violence between dis tinct religions, such as the Crusades between Christians and Muslims or today's Christian-Muslim clashes in Nigeria and Hindu-Muslim violence in India. The second form is between different sects or factions of the same religion. The age old Catholic-Orthodox and Catholic-Protestant conflicts are mirrored in recent wars in the former Yugoslavia and Northern Ireland. The historic Shi'a-Sunni conflict within Islam finds recent reflection in Pakistan, Iraq, and Afghanistan. A third form is between believers and nonbelievers or heretics. Theocratic regimes upholding extremist versions of their religion often use force against citizens deemed insufficiently pious—as in Iran or Taliban-run Afghanistan. Zealous citizens may decide to enforce piety themselves, aggressively con fronting women for inappropriate clothing or men for inadequate beards, as in Taliban Afghanistan. A fourth form, however, is between secular and religious institutions or individuals. Typically, secular governments have forcefully re pressed extremist or cult-like religious movements—in countries as diverse as Algeria, Egypt, Turkey, China, and the United States. Yet these four forms refer only to acute, visible religious violence. They overlook the myriad forms of chronic systemic and structural violence caused by religion that permeate societies and resist elimination. Three types of such chronic violence are widespread. The first is violent discrimination against tar geted, denigrated, or outcaste groups, despite their belonging to the same reli gion. Hinduism's discrimination of untouchables persists despite legislation and quotas for disadvantaged castes. The Burakumin outcastes in largely Bud dhist Japan continue to suffer social discrimination despite being legally lib erated in 1871. Discrimination against religious minorities is sometimes imposed directly by governments or indirectly enforced by religious majori ties. The second is gender-based violence, based on unchallenged scriptural justifications. Alarmingly widespread across religions, the range encompasses: female circumcision, witch burning, lapidation, bride burning, honor killings, mistreatment or burning of widows, segregation of menstruating women, so cioeconomic exploitation, political domination, and unequal rights. The third is sexual orientation. Several religions still condemn homosexuality and sodomy. Uganda recently attempted to institute extreme antigay legislation, al legedly with financial support from US-based fundamentalist Christians.40 Di verse forms of chronic religious violence are not exceptional, but instead pervasive; each religion finds ways to institute and validate them while ignor ing the resultant suffering. The Culpability of Religions As Smock accurately warns, "We need to beware of an almost universal propensity to oversimplify the role that religion plays in international affairs.</page><page sequence="8">156 Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion Religion is not usually the sole or even primary cause of conflict."41 Never theless, religions cannot disown culpability for acute and chronic violence. Karl Jaspers's four categories of guilt describing Nazi Germany—criminal, political, moral, and metaphysical—could be applied to religions.42 When re ligious authorities remain silent about wars, oppression, or tyranny that they are aware of, metaphysical guilt applies—such as the Vatican during the Holo caust. When religious authorities condone violence or exonerate extenuating circumstances, moral guilt applies—such as Buddhist monks in Sri Lanka. When religions are complicit in and endorse violence, political guilt applies. Religious blessings to military conquests, or clerics' benedictions to suicide bombers, are examples. Finally, when religions actively exhort violence as an acceptable and necessary means to save the faith or achieve religious ends, criminal guilt applies. Historically, existential battles for survival or historical oppression war ranted force; for example, Prophet Muhammad's jihad or Guru Gobind Singh's defensive mobilization of Sikhs. However, all contemporary vio lence with religious objectives—whether pro-life Christians killing pro choice activists, Hindu extremists eliminating Muslims, al-Qaeda and Islamic fundamentalists killing "infidels"—violates laws, and bears criminal responsibility, regardless of religious justification. Merely assigning guilt to religions will not change practices. Instead, religions need to evaluate their actions, recognize culpability, and assume responsibility for shaping a less violent future. Why Have Religions Failed as Peacebuilders? Numerous studies have attempted to extrapolate why and when religions cause war. Many resort to statistical analyses.43 Others find reasons in philosophy or psychology, economics or history.44 Real or perceived threats to survival, fear, and anxiety are cited.45 Contrarily, some scholars state that religious violence is not irrational, but a rational, logical choice.46 The phenomenon of religious fundamentalism and violence has attracted voluminous research. Scholars observe that shared ideological characteristics across fundamentalist movements may make them violence prone: reaction against religion's marginalization; selectivity in choosing and interpreting be liefs, practices, and scriptures; Manichean worldviews of good versus evil; un questioning absolutism; and messianism or millennialism. Their organizational structures may also contribute: an elect membership, member ship behavior codes, sharp boundaries between outsiders/insiders, and charis matic authoritarian leadership.47 Rising fundamentalist violence across diverse religions and continents un doubtedly merits examination. However, it should not divert attention and shift responsibility from mainstream religions. The violence inherent in un</page><page sequence="9">Rama Mani 157 questioned, but widespread, religious beliefs and practices remains unrecog nized. It is these, I suggest, that merit deep reflection and urgent action. As yet, only a minority are fundamentalists; a majority of the 87 percent of the world's self-proclaimed faithful belongs to mainstream, purportedly peaceful religions. Unless they critically self-examine their standard practices, they may augment instead of reduce violence. We have scant levers to influ ence or deradicalize fundamentalists once they are won over by extremist re ligious views, but we can still examine and reverse the pernicious effects of widespread mainstream religious practices before they cause more harm. The apparently innocuous standard religious beliefs and practices con taining ingrained, but unrecognized, belligerence are: singularity, proselytism, anthropocentricism, male authority, power, ritualism, and imperviousness.48 Each has been and can still be sources of strength for religions, but unexam ined and uncritically practiced, each fosters violence instead. Singularity Many religions explicitly state or implicitly believe that their god is para mount, their prophet his sole messenger, their religion the only path, and their people the chosen ones. Indeed, this is often the source of their appeal to and credibility with adherents. Prophets like Muhammad and Christ, saints like Ibn'Arabi and Ramakrishna, or scriptures like the Upanishads taught that all religions are but diverse paths toward a supreme truth or single God and urged religious tolerance. Yet their followers willingly deploy force or court perse cution to uphold their singularity. When a religion's leaders and believers up hold the uniqueness of their faith, they distinguish themselves from the vast majority of nonbelievers, considered inferior and unchosen. This leads them inescapably to competition and confrontation with other religions and hea thens, with violent outcomes. Unquestioned belief in superiority fuels inhumane conduct. The Val ladolid Controversy of 1551-1552 debated whether South American natives could be enslaved or massacred by conquistadors without incurring sin as they were patently heathen or "soul-less" by one Christian interpretation or, ac cording to the opposing theological position, should be considered human and converted en masse to save their souls. Valladolid's contemporary echoes are the belief of fundamentalist terrorists of all faiths that killing nonbelievers is sinless, divinely ordained and rewarded, and of evangelical missionaries in the obsessive pursuit of mass conversion whatever the cost or consequences. Yet mainstream religious believers manifest similar unquestioned, inhumane atti tudes and conduct toward nonbelievers. They may believe it is divinely or dained to support or exonerate crimes such as the killing of abortion doctors, gay men, lesbians, adulterers, or pagans, or to support policies such as the Is raeli occupation of Palestine, the invasion of "evil empires," the global war on Islamist terrorists, or, conversely, the annihilation of Israel.</page><page sequence="10">158 Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion Proselytism Proselytism was practiced, and sometimes required, by many faiths as the nat ural means of expansion. History is replete with the population of entire coun tries converting religions following defeat in military conquests, and communities changing faith to escape marginalization or persecution. Volun tary, incentive-based, or coercive conversion by several religious denomina tions is rampant today across the globe, transforming religious demographics in a generation. It is worrisome that accurate global statistics are not being col lected. Not all proselytizing was or is negative: sometimes, conversion meant survival for the oppressed or dignity for the humiliated. Countries penalizing proselytism harshly, especially for political reasons, are as disquieting as those restricting religious freedom.49 However, there are at least three reasons why proselytism elicits belligerence. First, proselytism emerges from a belief in su periority discussed above and fuels a willingness to deploy violence to pre serve and spread the faith. Today as historically, missionaries of all faiths use financial, psychological, and coercive means alongside spiritual ones to win converts, regardless of social ramifications. Second, financial incentives accompanying proselytism, particularly in poor countries, are unsustainable and foster dependency. Furthermore, they create new horizontal inequalities and social fissures between groups of haves and have-nots divided along unprecedented religious lines, without a past his tory of coexistence, thus fomenting conflict. Proselytizers bribe converts with services like health care and education, and withhold them from the recalci trant, repeating colonial practice. They may even attempt to shape govern mental policy with financial incentives, as with Uganda's sodomy law. Third, the rapid transformation of religious demographics across whole continents has destabilizing effects with long-term impacts that cannot yet be predicted. Missionary zeal to proselytize rapidly may transmit shallow or ex treme beliefs and practices and eschew deeper ecumenical philosophy. Peace loving religions may attract fanatical converts, as Islam—literally the religion of peace—is experiencing. The United States, Uganda, and more recently Nor way have suffered terrorist attacks by Christian-inspired individuals and cults. Consequently, proselytism is an overlooked cause of conflict—more dan gerous, I would argue, than restrictions on religious freedoms. Anthropocentricism Many religions contain subtle allusions of anthropocentricism—the belief that man, made in God's image, is the uniquely favored apex of creation. Anthro pocentricism is made explicit in the Bible's book of Genesis and is central to the three Abrahamic religions that dominate society and influence politics today. Major religions simultaneously underline the integrity of creation and man's incumbent stewardship of the earth allegorically, through stories like Noah's ark.50 Jiirgen Habermas elucidates that "the translation of man's like</page><page sequence="11">Rama Marti 1 59 ness to God into the notion of human dignity, in which all men partake equally and which is to be respected unconditionally," is one positive translation of Christian anthropocentricism into secular philosophy.51 Other translations are less benign. Historically, anthropocentricism justi fied as God's will both genocidal conquests against heathens and unbridled ex ploitation of flora and fauna. Today's global competition for energy and resources is a secular extension of the unquestioned once-religious conviction of human superiority: the universe's resources may be plundered by the elite of our singular species without restraint or repercussions, despite scientific ev idence of risks and religious cautions. This resource grab, we already know, has generated brutal war economies in the DRC, Sierra Leone, Angola, and elsewhere,52 and expropriated millions of indigenous peoples from their an cestral resource-rich lands. Now, NASA and other public and private entities plan to mine minerals on the moon, without question or critique. The unchecked ramifications of anthropocentricism threaten interplanetary life, yet it has not been sufficiently reconsidered or challenged by major religions. Male Authority Archaeological excavations reveal that goddess worship and female priests were common across continents in prehistoric religions.53 Newer religions of Christianity and Islam, and conservative forms of older religions such as Hin duism and Judaism, subsumed and overrode matriarchy and effaced egalitari anism from the indigenous communities that they converted. Selective interpretations of myths depicted women—like Eve in Abrahamic religions— as inferior, impure, and dangerous. Women, once custodians of spirituality, were banned from religious authority and strictly controlled; wise women, once oracles and priestesses, were burned as witches. Religiously sanctioned sexual discrimination by ostensibly peace-loving faiths persists in many forms, from overt lapidation and circumcision to covert sociopolitical domi nation and economic control. Male-dominated religions continue to resist at tempts to restore gender parity and share religious authority with women, with few exceptions like Protestants. Hindus, paradoxically, worship goddesses yet oppress women. Surviving indigenous religions that still honor women are in the minority. Religion's sexism not only violates women, but it also sows societal vio lence. Commonplace, religiously rationalized sexual violence fosters permis siveness and impunity in society. When women within a person's own faith—including their own sister, wife, daughter, or mother—are discrimi nated against and violated, violence against women or men of other faiths ap pears permissible. Women are not inculpable; they often enforce sexual violence to preserve the faith. Mothers impose honor killings or circumcision on daughters; some Rwandan nuns endorsed genocidal rape. The brutality of sexual violence during recent wars across religions and regions, as in the</page><page sequence="12">160 Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion DRC, Sri Lanka, and Colombia, and sexual abuse of prisoners in Iraq and Afghanistan are spillovers of unchallenged male authority. Power The founders and prophets of religions—Moses, Buddha, Christ, Muhammad, and others—championed justice and unflinchingly opposed political power and religious authority when required. This made them and their religions ap pealing to the masses. Buddhism and Jainism reformed Hinduism's discrimi natory violence, Christianity's compassion opposed Roman brutality, and Islam's inclusive equality welcomed society's downtrodden. However, oppos ing injustice ineluctably challenges political power and invites reprisal. The successive custodians of religions allied with or accumulated political and ma terial power, ostensibly to protect their institutions and congregations, but compromised their commitment to justice. While an understandable survival strategy historically, privileging power over justice contradicts the founding philosophies of these religions and spawns the four types of culpable conduct described above. Despite grassroots movements to counter oppression, like liberation theology in Latin America, most religions have succumbed to the pursuit of, or complicity with, political and economic power, overlooking or even perpetuating egregious injustice, inequality, and suffering in their con gregations and societies. Ritualism Over time each religion, informed by its specific cultural context, has evolved myriad rules to guide humans in all aspects of their moral and social lives and rituals to designate how they should worship. Religious rules restrained anti social conduct and were precursors of secular laws, providing foundations for modern jurisprudence. Rituals, replete with profound symbolism, provided orientation, meaning, and depth to life when understood and purposefully per formed. However, rules and rituals, notwithstanding their importance, are the outer crust of religions, not their core. All religions distinguish between the unchanging, timeless substance and the ever-changing form of religions: between the kernel of spiritual, philosoph ical wisdom with universal, timeless validity and the shell of rules, rituals, taboos, and practices that vary across religions, time, and place as they con stantly evolve and adapt to social change. The Hindu Upanishads distinguish between Sruti, the universal truths in all religions such as insights into the uni verse, human nature, and existence, and Smrti, the rules and regulations, prac tices, and rites that change over time. The Upanishads clearly indicate that "the Smrti is always subordinate to the Sruti in spiritual matters."54 This hierarchy applies to most religions, as they originally prioritized the true spiritual path of self-realization above ritualism or adherence to social rules. Effectively, rules and rituals, even prayers, are considered stepping-stones to prepare oneself for</page><page sequence="13">Rama Mani 161 philosophical understanding; with spiritual awakening, rituals are transcended and become futile, and rules are transcended as righteous conduct becomes nat ural. The plethora of erudite philosophers and inspiring mystics of each religion eulogized the essential pursuit of unity and integrity embodied by their prophets and, like them, shunned dogma and ritualism. Saints like Saint Teresa of Avila exhorted constant self-examination and self-improvement rather than rule en forcement and vigilante justice against miscreants.55 Most religions had inbuilt mechanisms to clarify universal truths through theological reflection, dialogue, and consensus, and to update and explicate rituals to reflect societal changes. The priority of universal truth over ritual was once understood; today, confusion and conflation between substance and form prevails. Fear of diluting religion, or deviating from the prophets' sup posed strictures, ossifies scripture, interpretation, and practice. Religions per ceive change as threatening and react defensively. Religious authorities cling to the form of rules and rituals and enforce them unflinchingly on believers while violating the substance and spirit of their religions in doing so. Funda mentalists excel at this—such as the Taliban's religious police in their Depart ment of the Promotion of Virtue and the Prohibition of Vice, or Christian pro-lifers who murder abortion doctors. However, so do mainstream religions. Ordinary believers become vigilante enforcers of rules and conduct, such as dress codes, and belligerent guardians of the faith. Imperviousness Impulses for religious adaptation and innovation emerge over time from ex ternal pressures or from the internal need to give enhanced meaning to scrip tures in changed human and societal circumstances. When new religions or denominations arise, they offer a ready invitation to older religions to reform, adapt, and innovate—not least, to avoid losing adherents. Each split within Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism stimulated profound internal rethinking and frequent reform. Buddhism's and Jainism's nonviolent self-realization led Hindu reformers to repudiate discriminatory ritualism and revive Vedic essence. Emergent Islam's insistence on equal dignity shook Christians and Hindus to reexamine their embrace of power and prestige. Thus, constant review, examination, adaptation, and innovation were once the norm for religions and kept them vibrant and relevant. Today, when faced with external or internal challenges, mainstream religions often choose the path of stagnation rather than innovation. They deny, bury, or obfuscate chal lenges instead of confronting them openly; they absolve instead of punishing or reforming in-house offenders. The Catholic Church's response to sexual abuse allegations is an example. Challenges provide religions with welcome opportunities to clarify truths, become accountable, revivify faith, and strengthen the community. Instead, when fear of criticism leads religious au thorities to close ranks and refuse reform, the resultant stagnation fuels inter</page><page sequence="14">162 Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion nal corruption and moral decrepitude. Religious innovators do not need to re press critics, while stagnators become paranoid and repress internal critics and suppress external threats. Rabbi Jonathan Wittenberg's observation applies across religions: "In tension is life; in challenge the relevance of the Torah is revealed. If we do not bring to it the issues of our conscience and our day, we and our Judaism will live impoverished and bifurcating lives."56 Re-ligare: The Religious Link The word religion originates from the Latin re-ligare, meaning to link, tie, or bind. The re hints at an original bond or union that was broken, which religion restores. The primordial function of religions and spiritual traditions, I argue, is providing or restoring a triple linkage or union. First, religions link or unite human beings primarily to themselves: to their own consciousness through self-reflection and contemplation. Second, they link or unite people to each other socially through bonds of compassion. Third, they link or unite humans to God, the universe, truth, or whatever expression is given by each faith to the divine. The three are mutually reinforcing and lead to salvation, paradise, lib eration, or moksha. However, religious authorities surreptitiously reduced this triple union to a single bond between humans and God. Several religions earlier called for a direct relationship between individuals and God without intermediaries. This was discarded as religious institutions and their clergy grew powerful. Reach ing God now required the intermediary of earthly representatives—priests, imams, rabbis, or pundits—and could be pursued only within religious sites at mandated times. Introspection and compassion were subordinated to the need to placate God by pleasing the clergy and aggrandizing places of worship. Notwithstanding many individual exceptions, the clergy's role in all religions became one of division, manipulation, and control of the faithful, with the in subordinate punished with excommunication or suppression. These seven unchecked practices have corroded religions and made them aggressive, often unwittingly and sometimes deliberately. If each religion can acknowledge serenely that its kernel of universal truth is impervious to external attacks, religions will relinquish their defensive streak. If, going further, each re ligion can acknowledge that its own truths are mirrored in different expressions by all other faiths, religions will also discard their offensive mechanisms. Conclusion: Religions' Potential to Build Peaceful Governance Marc Gopin pointedly observes, "As religion becomes more important in the lives of hundreds of millions of people, the political power generated by this commitment will either lead to a more peaceful world or to a more violent world, depending on how that power is utilized."57 Religions will cause more violence unless they commit to change. Deradicalization programs, interfaith</page><page sequence="15">Rama Mani 163 initiatives, or peacemaking courses are well intentioned but grossly inade quate. Religious leaders need to acknowledge and reverse their inherently vi olent beliefs and practices, and assume responsibility as peacebuilders. They could start by adopting the five propositions below, each in their sui generis manner. Prioritize Justice over Power Today, the alliance of religious authorities with political and economic elites and neglect of spiraling poverty and inequality is both unacceptable and self destructive for religions. Studies have shown that inequality between groups— horizontal inequality—is a major underlying cause for war.58 The desperate or outraged may revolt against corrupt elites as in South America or the Middle East, in Delhi's Pragati Maidan, or on New York's Wall Street. More often, elites deploy disproportionate force to avoid redistributing wealth and power as in apartheid South Africa or Syria. By ignoring or exonerating injustice in their cozy relationship with political and economic power, religious authorities are facilitating, abetting, and fueling conflict when they should be mitigating conflict, fostering equity and justice, and building peace. Speaking out against injustice will be uncomfortable initially for religious establishments and lead ers because they may fall from political favor but, at last, they will be uphold ing their founding values and contributing to just peace and sound governance. Integrate What They Dominated and Rejected The second urgent task is for religions to become integrators and serve soci etal inclusion, overcoming their divisive past. Two steps are necessary, one internal and the other external. The first, internal, step is to integrate and ac cord equal treatment to all the marginal groups treated as inferior within their own religions: women, gay men, lesbians, people with disabilities, un touchables. Because the discrimination of women is the most commonplace and widespread, first and foremost women must be restituted their respect and authority within all religions, as some Protestant churches have already done. Religious institutions would need to systematically reverse the struc tural injustices and gender discrimination ingrained in doctrines, rituals, and practices. The second, external, step is to outgrow fear of threats to survival and adopt an inclusive approach to outsiders. All religious scriptures are resonant with messages of the unity of humanity and all life forms. Confidence in such unity makes us fearless. The Upanishads say, "Until we realize the unity of life, we live in fear,"59 while the Tao Te Ching says, "Whoever can see through all fear will always be safe."60 It is time for clergy to abstain from instilling fear against imaginary enemies and sowing divisions, and instead to adopt a trusting attitude that appreciates and integrates other religions and ways of life. Just as in agriculture, monoculture may be productive initially but is self destructive over time. Life and culture thrive on diversity. Where syncretism</page><page sequence="16">164 Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion has led to intermingling between older and newer religions, it has fostered peaceful coexistence over generations of acculturation: Shintoism and Bud dhism in Japan; Quechua, Mayan, and Aztec spirituality with Christianity in Latin America; Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Christianity in India; Ubuntu and countless African spiritual traditions with Christianity and Islam in Africa; Judaism with Abyssinian culture and Coptic Christianity in Ethiopia; Maori spiritual wisdom with Catholicism in New Zealand, to name a few. These mar riages of spiritual and religious traditions may not always prevent violence, but they provide resilience and protection in addition to cultural wealth. Inter faith peace initiatives cited above draw on the capacity of committed religious believers to unite their aims with believers of other faiths, without fear of di lution or contamination, in pursuit of a higher goal. Until such integration and inclusion becomes the rule and not the exception, religions will not tap their peacebuilding potential, but when they do, they could become foundational pillars for just governance. Undertake Critical Inquiry Third, religions must open themselves up to critical inquiry and internal debate as in past times. Ancient religions, including Judaism, survived for centuries without written scriptures not through unquestioning memorization and recita tion, but through constant dialogue and inquiry between disciples and teach ers. Even written religions lacked sufficient copies of their scriptures in ancient times and depended on oral transmission and debate. Faith and reason were considered natural allies in religions like Islam, which pioneered scien tific discoveries in its golden age.61 In Hinduism, this "spirit of inquiry" led believers to "fearlessly question their gods and the tenets of their traditional faiths" because, "in the pursuit of truth, such skepticism is but the prelude to rational faith."62 Contrarily, the medieval Christian church feared science and fiercely opposed the European Enlightenment's turn from blind faith to em piricism. Sadly, other religions followed suit. As the religious culture of criti cal inquiry was replaced by repression of self-appraisal, critique, or dissent, stagnation replaced innovation. Ibn Arabi indicated in the thirteenth century CE what religions must do today: "Opt for freedom and with this new free dom, fight the tyranny of the ego. Sit on the throne of Intellect. Put the crown of service on your head. Judge, not with preconception, but by the reality of the Now. The truth is in the present."63 In many ancient religions, female deities represented wisdom: Athena in Greece; Sophia in Rome; Saraswati in Hinduism; the Celtic Brigid; the female divinity Wisdom eulogized in the Book of Wisdom of Solomon; the Egyptian Ama'at representing wisdom, truth, justice, and order. Both the feminine and the quest for wisdom that they epitomized were banished effectively by reli gions; critical inquiry should necessarily accompany the reintegration of women within religions.</page><page sequence="17">Rama Marti 165 Abandon Anthropocentricism and Embrace Cosmotheandry Critical enquiry would necessarily lead to a long overdue reevaluation of an thropocentricism and its destructiveness. The self-proclaimed superiority of monotheistic religions "of the book," and their continued denigration of so called primitive, polytheistic, indigenous religions and oral spiritual tradi tions is largely unchallenged today. Even progressive interfaith initiatives privilege major, Abrahamic, or monotheistic book religions and exclude the wealth of cosmotheandric religions. What they disparage as uncivilized poly theism are life-affirming, planet-preserving beliefs in the interconnectedness of humans with nature and the cosmos, which modern science is confirming. Monotheist religions also overlook the egotism of their anthropocentricism and remain unaccountable for the consequent environmental devastation and social violence. Anthropocentricism's myopic rapacity must be rejected and replaced by an embrace of cosmotheandry and ecology. Indigenous cosmotheandric reli gions that survived exploitation and domination due to their life-embracing, conflict-preventing practices can teach us much. When humanity resumes its rightful place as a small but vital part of this integrated, interdependent uni verse, it will no longer consider thinkable the plundering of resources or people for profit. Only a new reverence for nature and the fragile intercon nectedness of life can save our endangered planet, prevent imminent re source conflicts, and transform ongoing wars. Pursue Contemplation, Self-Examination, and Conscious Evolution Lao Tzu inimitably stated: Knowing others is knowledge Knowing yourself is true wisdom Mastering others is strength Mastering yourself is true power64 It is facile to criticize religions for their failings, but difficult to examine one self. The vision quest remains fundamental for Native Americans: despite a community-oriented spirituality, each individual undertakes the quest for his or her life's purpose alone. Buddha preached thought-free meditation and mindfulness as the path to self-knowledge and liberation. For Ibn Arabi, muhaqqiqun (realizers) are those who fulfill life's purpose and fully actualize the soul's spiritual, cosmic, and divine potential. Self-analysis and constant self-improvement also underlay Christianity, as emphasized by Saint Teresa of Avila. Most religions provided a psychological pathway for the inner journey to uncover life's purpose—free, mediated therapy, as it were. Yet being ardu ous, it is the path least traveled by faithful multitudes that zealously observe rules and rituals.</page><page sequence="18">166 Cure or Curse? The Role of Religion Today, as humanity gropes for meaning in a sea of violence, it is essential that religious institutions and leaders reclaim this missing link of religion and urge their followers to above all pursue self-examination. Lack of conscious ness and suppressed unconscious urges underlie violent acts, as psychology re veals. Religious leaders must inspire their faithful to raise their consciousness and take responsibility for their conduct. This may strike them as a diminution of their religious authority, but it is essential in both reducing violence and deepening genuine faith. When each individual, faithful, agnostic, or atheist acts consciously and responsibly—and is made accountable when she or he does not—violence will cease. Such conscious and engaged spirituality could provide foundations for peaceful governance; such revitalized religions would merit renewed attention within international relations as agents of positive change.65 St. Teresa of Avila proclaimed, against the backdrop of sixteenth-century Spanish inquisition: Why this great war between the countries—the countries—inside of us? What are all these insane borders we protect? What are all these different names for the same church of love we kneel in together? For it is true, to gether we live, and only at that shrine where all are welcome will God sing loud enough to be heard.66 In twelfth-century Basra, Rabia, the Sufi slave-turned-saint sang: In my heart, there is a temple, a shrine, a mosque, a church, where I kneel. Prayer should bring us to an altar where no name and no walls exist.67 These prophetic women knew then what remains true today: religions, if un examined and blindly followed, can cause untold division and violence and justify tyrannical governance. But if examined and sought consciously, they can bring solace, wisdom, and grace to humankind and become pillars of peaceful governance. © Notes Rama Mani is senior research associate with the Centre for International Studies, Uni versity of Oxford, and councilor with the World Future Council in Hamburg.
