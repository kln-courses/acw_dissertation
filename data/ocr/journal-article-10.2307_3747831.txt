<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE NATURE OF AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE' THE EARL OF LISTOWEL, P.C., Ph.D. THE traditional business of Aesthetics has been the study of the aesthetic experience and activity of mankind, in order to show what it is and how it can be distinguished from other experiences and activities. The assumption commonly made is that we ourselves, like others before us, have had a specifically aesthetic experience in the enjoyment of art or the beauty of nature, or have been engaged in the making of something unquestionably artistic. This basic assump- tion has been challenged recently by I. A. Richards, who calls aesthetic experience "a phantom." His view is shared by other contemporary philosophers, who also maintain that there is no appreciable difference between an aesthetic reaction and any other frame of mind, or between artistic behaviour and other forms of creative work. We can certainly appeal to experience for the support of a postulate usually taken for granted and say that most artists, authors, and ordinary people in fact regard their aesthetic experi- ence as something entirely distinct from what they do or feel at other times. Analysis will show whether this common-sense opinion is illusory. The main emphasis has been placed on different aspects of aesthetic experience by different writers, according to the angle of personal interest from which each has approached the problem of beauty. Some have been concerned with beauty as a philosophical value, with its relation to other values, and to philosophy as an interpreta- tion of the universe. Some have studied the delight we take in art or nature, others the activity of the artist at his work, and others still the structure of the fine or applied arts which primitive and civilized cultures have produced at different epochs in history and pre- history. In this lecture, I shall place my emphasis on the sort of experience with which we are all familiar when we join an audience at a theatre, wander round a picture gallery, or range the countryside. But as our appreciation of art or nature is a response to something outside us, and as the structure of this outside object conditions and qualifies what we feel, it is impossible to understand how and why we respond aesthetically to things without examining carefully the external stimulus as well as what happens in our minds. It may perhaps be asked whether it is really possible to assess the significance of art, or to find out what it is that constitutes the aesthetic aspect of the onlooker's experience, if the artist himself is left out of account. x Lecture given to the Royal Institute of Philosophy on March i6, I95I. i8</page><page sequence="2">THE NATURE OF AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE Is there not something peculiar and unique about the vision of the practising artist, and the process whereby he moulds his material into the shape of an original imaginative conception? I do not think that the activity of an artist differs substantially, in any aesthetic respect, from that of the spectator who looks at or listens to his work. What the artist tries to do, and succeeds in doing if he is a competent artist, is to communicate his imaginative vision and emotion to those capable of appreciating his work. For they repro- duce in themselves, at the moment of contact with it, more or less precisely the imaginative experience it has embodied. A work of art transmits to others the emotional mood in which it was conceived and of which it is the embodiment or expression. The great critics and interpreters of art are those whose imaginative stature equals that of the artists whom they interpret. Indeed, the experience of the onlooker or critic, when it is vivid and adequate to the object, is often purer than that of the original artist. The artist is prompted to write or paint or compose by a strange and varied assortment of motives and intentions. He may have been animated by social ambition or the need for money, or the desire to be recognized and to please. He may equally have been impelled by religious belief, patriotic enthusiasm, or other aesthetically irrelevant con- siderations. In judging his own finished product, or those of other artists, he is apt to look for technical accomplishment, and often over- looks the genuinely aesthetic appeal. What distinguishes the artist from the laymen is not a keener insight into the nature of beauty, but the knowledge and application of a particular technique. A painter or a musician is a man who has acquired, by study and experiment, a technical skill which was originally part of his social heritage, and which enables him to learn how to model, to draw, or to compose. Academicians are none the less artists when they have an admirable technique but nothing to say. There is therefore no reason to doubt that a careful analysis of the impression made by works of art upon a sensitive observer will also reveal the specifically aesthetic element in the experience of the artist, which depends only for its transmission on technical skill. It is generally agreed among writers on our subject that the experi- ence of beauty takes place at the level of perception, and that we do not derive aesthetic satisfaction from isolated sensations, or from the processes of reasoning and conceptual thought. Croce, of course, has maintained that aesthetic experience is co-extensive with the whole field of perception. I do not think this view is borne out by common sense. It is surely the case that most of the things we see or hear in daily life leave us unmoved, aesthetically indifferent, and that some only of the objects that we encounter occasion anything that we can fairly describe as aesthetic satisfaction or the reverse. We I9</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY should therefore aim at finding out what distinguishes an aesthetic reaction from the mere awareness of what goes on around us. What is it that renders our attitude of mind when we are reading poetry, or admiring a sunset, different from the attitude of mind in which we read a text-book, or view an appetizing meal? The first and obvious distinction is one that has been drawn, in varying terms, by almost every writer on aesthetics. The aesthetic attitude, they have asserted, is contemplative and disinterested, because it is free from the per- sonal desires and interests which influence us in our practical relations with our environment, and from the cognitive interests of pure curiosity. It is an attitude, so far as we are aware, confined to the human species, and even so an interruption of our normal response to the self-regarding impulses which shape our conduct. The utili- tarian requirements of earning a living or getting on in society, the appetities of hunger, thirst, or sexual desire, subordinate the objects in our surroundings to a variety of personal wants and purposes. We regard them as a means for the satisfaction of these private needs, not as ends in themselves. The necessary preliminary to an aesthetic relationship with our environment is to regard the objects we see or hear as ends in themselves, and not as instruments for obtaining our personal ends. We cannot do this without discarding momentarily the utilitarian or practical approach to which we are accustomed. It is the difference between seeing and looking, between hearing and listening. Bullough has well described this psychological adjustment as "a putting of the object out of gear with our practical needs and ends." This enables us, for example, even in these days of a somewhat exiguous meat ration, to enjoy a flayed carcase by Rembrandt without wanting to take it home. It may be argued that psycho-analysis has shown that some works of art afford satisfaction for repressed infantile desires. There is an element of truth in the psycho-analytic contention that material of this kind sometimes finds its way into art. But it should be noted that both we as spectators, and the artist who uses this material, are gratifying imagined rather than real desires. And there is no conflict, as we shall see later on, between an imagined feeling or desire and the contemplative state of mind. The real desires may be violent and even destructive, but their imaginative counterpart is not powerful enough to disturb the aesthetic equilibrium. But the requirement that our observation of art should be devoid of practical bias is not sufficient in itself. A theoretical or speculative bias is equally harmful. We must not ask ourselves what an object is from the point of view of chemical or physical analysis, or through what chain of causal agencies it has become what it is. For it ceases immediately to be an aesthetic object if we approach it from the standpoint of a scientist, a psychologist, a sociologist, or an art 20</page><page sequence="4">THE NATURE OF AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE historian. The object we are contemplating loses its individuality and disappears from view as soon as it becomes a typical example of a school or style of art, or the final product of a variety of social and stylistic influences. The genuine aesthetic object, whether we find it in art or nature, is always something unique. No two poems or pictures, no two persons, no two trees or leaves on the same tree are precisely identical. What we do in aesthetic contemplation is to focus our attention upon one person or upon one thing just as it appears in our field of consciousness, with its full complement of sensuous qualities, its formal structure, and its intellectual and emotional significance. And this act of concentrated attention deprives it of its external relations. As a real thing it has a past as well as a present, and is woven into a net-work of relations with all its neighbours in space. But aesthetic objects, at the moment of contemplation, are cut off from the past and the future, and isolated from surrounding space. This process of psychological isolation is often assisted by physical means, such as the frame of a picture, the pedestal of a statue, or the proscenium of a theatre. The disinterested or detached quality of the attitude to beauty, which has so often been described in the writings of philosophers and art critics, has usually, and I think rightly, been regarded as a sine qua non of aesthetic experience. But although this semi-auto- matic psychological adjustment is essential if we want to respond adequately to the qualities of an aesthetic object, it does not follow that by deliberately making the adjustment we shall necessarily find ourselves experiencing beauty. If we empty our consciousness of its usual baggage of thoughts and wishes and feelings, and con- centrate our whole attention upon a patch of drab distemper, or close our eyes so as to be absorbed in the strident noises of a busy street, our complete detachment from practical and theoretical pre-occupations will not be rewarded by the faintest trace of aesthetic satisfaction. The obvious conclusion is that the disinterestedness of the onlooker is indeed a necessary but not a sufficient condition for the experience of beauty. The right state of mind needs to be related to the right object for the right experience to follow. The aesthetic object owes much of its appeal to the direct impres- sion it makes upon our sense organs. Let us examine for a moment this sensory factor in the appreciation of art and nature. It is a commonplace that painters have an eye for effects of colour and light, musicians an ear for the quality of musical sounds, and poets a peculiar sensitivity to the sensuous and evocative qualities of language. The higher senses, sight and hearing, have often been regarded as bringing a particularly important contribution to art and its enjoyment. They alone introduce us to whole objects, which can easily be viewed with detachment because they are at a distance 21</page><page sequence="5">PHILOSOPHY from our own bodies. It is not until recently that the contribution of the other senses has been fully recognized. It is true of course, that our inner sensations, muscular or organic, and the senses of touch, temperature, and taste, register the changing conditions of our own bodies, and cannot therefore contribute directly to the satisfaction we derive from an aesthetic object. But the sense of smell has become so divorced from its biological function in the human species that it can now be fairly regarded as a channel of aesthetic pleasure. Everyone will recollect the variety of field and garden scents to be found in the English countryside. Now we locate these scents, not in our noses, but in the objects-the flowers, fields, and so on-which waft them to our nostrils. They can therefore add to the pleasure we get from the shapes and the sensuous qualities, and even the character, of scenes encountered at different seasons in the country. But the vividness and discrimination of all our senses, internal as well as external, lower as well as higher, are of special value in our reaction to an aesthetic stimulus when we reproduce or revive the quality of past sensations. We not only recognize the familiar sen- suous qualities of an object, we sometimes feel them. This feeling of the object's sensuous qualities is brought about by a revival in imagination of the real sensations corresponding to the qualities we perceive. When we read descriptive poetry, or look at a sunny or snowy landscape, or the portrait of some richly caparisoned per- sonage, or watch the scudding clouds, there takes place what the Germans have called an Einempfindung, a spontaneous fusion of our own imagined sensations with the appropriate features of the object. There are six lines in the "Eve of St. Agnes" in which Keats has used our senses of colour, sound, smell, taste, and touch to complete his picture of voluptuous repose. And still she slept an azure-lidded sleep, In blanched linen, smooth and lavender'd, While he from forth the closet brought a heap Of candied apple, quince, and plum, and gourd; With jellies soother than the creamy curd, And lucent syrups, tinct with cinnamon. This is an example of the way in which we contribute tactile, olfactory, and other types of imagined sensation to the visual images of poetry. We often fill in the contours and colours of physical objects in the same way, solely by imagination, and without any direct con- tact between an external stimulus and our sensory nerves. We say quite rightly that we see the bitter cold of the snow, the warmth of bright sunshine, the smooth or coarse texture of different materials, the strength and exertion of human figures that climb or run or fight, 22</page><page sequence="6">THE NATURE OF AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE and the relaxation of the body at rest. This projection of imagined sensations is, of course, a common accompaniment of perception. But it seems only to come fully into play when the inhibiting influ- ence of casual or cognitive acquaintanceship has been removed. This fusion of remembered sense-data with real or imagined objects is quite different from the linking of one thing with another by association with our past experience. A sound or a colour or a smell may suddenly remind us of a happy holiday episode, or a person we like. But you will observe that such fortuitous associations, unlike fused perception, are not a direct response to a particular stimulus For the thing perceived merely stirs up a slow process of reverie or recollection. Moreover, associations of this kind throw into relief particular occasions in our own past, and are not relevant to the structure and individuality of the object. Different people will be reminded of different events, and their experience will not be the common response of the perfectly attuned spectator. The contribution of the different senses, and their relative promi- nence, vary from one work of art and from one art form to another. The role of touch and motor or muscular sensations in the visual arts, important as it is, has sometimes been emphasized to the exclusion of other factors yet more essential. You will remember that Vernon Lee coined the expression "aesthetic empathy" to describe the way we attribute "our own modes of dynamic experience, motor ideas, to shapes," and that more recently that admirable critic B. Berenson has built a whole theory of visual art on tactile and muscular sen- sations. His failure to assess the relative significance of the formal and representative features of painting and sculpture has led him to claim that "tactile values and movement are the essential qualities in the figure arts." This theory suffers from the exclusiveness of all theories that whittle down aesthetic experience to a single cause or feeling, or to the perception of a simple quality. It is all the more inadequate because it limits our experience of these arts to the level of imagined sensation. But it serves as a useful antidote when other art critics claim that the formal regularity of design is the sole virtue in the painter's art. I think it would be generally agreed that all the senses enhance the vividness and increase the pleasure of our aesthetic experience. But their limited effect can only be gauged accurately when con- sidered in a broader context. They make us aware of a fragment, a single aspect of the whole aesthetic object, which consists in part only of its sensuous qualities. Even the simplest colour or shape has form and often character as well. The sensory factor in aesthetic experience is therefore a part of the total impression, and can only be isolated in post facto analysis from the whole to which it belongs. 23</page><page sequence="7">PHILOSOPHY Another feature of the aesthetic object, as we grasp it in percep- tion, is the arrangement of and relation between the lines, colours, shapes, tones, or words that constitute its peculiar form. I am using this ambiguous noun not in the dictionary sense as the shape or outline of a thing or person, nor in a technical sense peculiar to philosophy, but in the sense in which it is often used to connote a relationship of similarity or resemblance which knits together the parts of an aesthetic object. We frequently refer to this relationship as proportion, symmetry, balance, design, when we meet it in the spatial arts of architecture, painting, and sculpture, as rhythm or rhythmic movement in the temporal arts of poetry, music, and the dance. It is the regularity of a spatial or temporal pattern which knits a painting or a musical composition into a unified whole. These common features of a complex whole have often been described in aesthetics as a display of unity within variety. The difficulty about this formula is that it seems too wide, for it includes the properties of many objects outside the range of aesthetic experience. Of course we should not forget that our normal vision is constantly failing to notice the aesthetic aspect of our surroundings. When we substitute a prolonged gaze for a superficial glance the shape or form of many ordinary things assume a novel significance. Indeed, the modern artist is often concerned with lifting the veil from beauty as a by- product of our industrial civilization. It is equally true that much we see or hear leaves a blurred or confused impression, which offers no satisfaction to our appetite for formal regularity. Even so, it can hardly be denied that there is a measure of similarity in everything we perceive. What really distinguishes an aesthetic object from other things is that its unity is more highly organized, that, however complex it may be, there are more points of similarity between its parts than in the visible or audible structure of the ordinary products of man or nature. A more accurate and specific description than unity within variety is provided by the expression "organic unity." This implies that the unity of a poem or a sonata is so closely knit that you cannot add or subtract a word from the former, or a bar from the latter, without spoiling the whole work to which they belong. If this expression is not used to suggest a difference in kind between the structure of a work of art and that of other physical objects, or a mystical affinity between art and living organisms, it is a useful way of describing the formal properties of aesthetic pheno- mena. There is no doubt that formal patterns are found throughout art and nature. It has been shown experimentally that people get aesthetic pleasure from extremely simple objects, a patch of pure colour, a simple geometrical figure like a circle or a rectangle, a rhythm tapped out with a pencil by a child. Thus form extends from simple objects with an elementary appeal to the most complicated, 24</page><page sequence="8">THE NATURE OF AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE difficult, and highly organized works of fine art. But in art, even in its unrepresentative branches, form encounters a rival in the emotions and desires which the artist has expressed in his finished work. The relative importance of form and expressive content in art depends partly on the artist himself, partly on the school to which he belongs, and partly on the medium which he fashions. Some artists and some schools of art prefer formal harmony to emotional expressiveness, some arts lend themselves more easily to the arrangement of pat- terns than to the communication of states of mind. In poetry, the meaning of words is more important than metre, rhyme, alliteration and other formal devices. In painting and sculpture the portrayal of a subject is also easier than abstract design. Architecture and the applied arts are better adapted to purely formal treatment. In music alone form and expressive content are equally matched. This is one reason why music at its best is superior to the other arts. But in each case it is the emphasis that matters, and the one quality need never exclude the other. How essential it is to strike the perfect balance can be seen when too much stress is laid upon one or the other of these twin ingredients. Let me give you a familiar example. In reaction against the Impressionist school of painting, which tended to neglect composition, post-Impressionists started the cult of form. This led to Cubism, and other varieties of abstract art, from which painters are now trying to find their way back to the painting of life. For it is generally recognized that the greatest exponents of the art of painting have combined design with insight into the subtleties of personality and the drama of social and personal relations. The only field in which form often predominates to the point of ousting content is in the minor arts. The shape of a vase, the arabesque on a carpet, the pattern on a wallpaper, can be complete in themselves after colour and imagined movement have been sub- tracted. It does not, of course, follow that useful things cannot also be endowed with life. It often happens that a still life, or the inani- mate objects in a room, acquire a personality of their own. But this does not lessen the charm of a functional arrangement of lines and shapes unblemished by fussy detail or unnecessary ornament. Although in this way form as organic unity pervades art and nature, it lacks the wider and more moving appeal of expressive content. For content reveals a different and more intimate level of human experience, the level of will and feeling and emotion. We pass from the stage of immediate perception, at which form and sensuous qualities are the chief source of our aesthetic satisfaction, to another stage at which relevant fragments from our past experience are added. Thus it is that the emotional and conative background of our minds gives the object character as well as qualities directly perceived. Indeed, it is the function of the artist to crystallize in his 25</page><page sequence="9">PHILOSOPHY products the whole range of human desires, feelings, and emotions, from the animal passions of anger, hatred and revenge, to the most subtle moral, mystical, or religious sentiments. We realize, of course, that this irrational sub-stratum of consciousness is only the raw material of the artistic imagination. Such material is in itself neither art nor the experience it gives, it is strictly neutral. From Hume to the present day the predominant view among writers on aesthetics has been that feeling is the core of the aesthetic experience. Their main perplexity has always been to identify the particular kind of feeling we have in this type of experience, and to distinguish it from the many other feelings which occur in the course of our daily lives. What is going on in our minds, they have asked, when we claim to see the calm in a sunset or the despair in a gesture, when we say we hear the fury of the storm or the joy or melancholy or tenderness of an allegro or an adagio? Many writers have noted the curious manner in which, at such moments, there seems to be a sort of chemical synthesis between subject and object. You will remember that Bosanquet described the aesthetic attitude as pleasure in a "feeling embodied in a perceived appearance," while Alexander talked of a sensitive onlooker "imputing" his mind to the scene before him. Both philosophers appear to agree that the peculi- arity of an aesthetic reaction is that we add mental qualities to the physical and sensuous qualities of the objects we perceive. This view is shared by the Einfiihlung school in Germany, and by the psycho- logical writers who followed them. The originality of this school of thought lies in their attempt to explain, by meticulous and detailed analysis, how external objects come to be invested with mental qualities they do not in themselves possess. They maintain that in aesthetic experience we become aware of objective feelings, "gegen- standliche Gefiihle," which we automatically regard as belonging to the perceived object and not to ourselves; we see feeling in a gesture, we hear it in a sound. What distinguishes these objective feelings from the real emotions and desires of ordinary life is that they seem to occur in the object, and to be one of its own attributes, instead of taking place within us and belonging to our own personal- ity. It is, I think, true that we are not conscious of these objective feelings except as qualities of the object we see or hear or imagine. For this projection of our own state of mind, whether emotional or conative, into the object before us, does not involve a simultaneous awareness of the state of mind in ourselves and of its expression in the object. It seems in fact to be the case that we are not conscious, at the moment of our aesthetic experience, that these objective feelings originated in our own minds. We note in retrospect how we were unconscious at the time that the object had assumed its emo- tional or conative colour by an act of self-projection. We are therefore 26</page><page sequence="10">THE NATURE OF AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE not directly aware of the mechanism of aesthetic empathy. We infer it from our observation of emotional expressiveness in material objects devoid of life or mind. It is, after all, only indirectly that we get to know about unconscious mental processes, including memory. At this point we can draw a dividing line between the mental mechanism of projection, and the mental content projected from our minds. The projective mechanism operates in the same way, whatever the experience may be, but what we project depends on each particular situation, and varies in accordance with the structure of the object which confronts us. There is often in such situations, as I have already pointed out, an Einempfindung, a projection of sensation, as well as an Einfiihlung, a projection of feeling. I have described how sensations which adhere in this way to external objects are in the main imaginative simulacra, which share the distinctive characteristics of objective feelings. It may be urged against this view that there is nothing peculiarly aesthetic about this sub-conscious transfer of sensations or feelings to objects, for such transference occurs quite frequently in ordinary perception. We detect emotion in the sound of a voice, or the glance of an eye. We see the wetness of the pavement, or feel the warmth of the fire. Indeed, it has been admitted by the theorists of Einfiihlung that empathy does take place in many ordinary and aesthetically neutral situ- ations. But what distinguishes aesthetic empathy from what happens generally in fused perception is the uninhibited flow of our sympa- thetic feelings, which is due to the absence of the usual psychological restraints. Aesthetic empathy is more vivid and complete than ordinary empathy because our imaginative sympathy is not obstruc- ted by personal interests or by the swarm of associations which recognition usually ushers into our field of consciousness. It follows, of course, that aesthetic experience is different in degree and not in quality from the experiences of everyday life, and that we do not employ any special sense of beauty or intuitive faculty when we respond to art or nature. Indeed, mythological and other primitive beliefs show how deeply the anthropomorphic tendency is rooted in human nature. Of course, it would be a mistake to confuse the feelings peculiar to aesthetic experience either with their origin in this animistic tendency, or with other feelings that they resemble. The French and German writers who have closely studied this subject agree that they are a kind of sympathetic feeling-what the French have called "symbolical sympathy," the Germans "aesthetic sympathy or Einfiihlung"-and that it is the vividness of this imagin- ative sympathy, together with the fusion of its content with the object, which distinguish it from other forms of sympathy and from our whole subjective sensibility. It follows from the sympathetic character of aesthetic feelings that they differ in the same way as 27</page><page sequence="11">PHILOSOPHY sympathy in general from subjective emotion, impulse, and desire. As they are a revival in imagination of the qualitative colour of real emotional or conative states, they lack the overwhelming intensity of the natural impulse or emotive shock. They therefore last for a shorter time, and are more easily subject to voluntary control. This enables us to brush quickly aside the sympathetic pain we have experienced in witnessing a tragedy or reading a pathetic story, to pass rapidly from one mood to another in listening to music, and to submit to a number of different and sometimes antagonistic states of feeling provoked by the characters and incidents in a novel or a play. It has been said that this elusive feeling is a special kind of pleasure. But although aesthetic experience is usually pleasant, the feeling of pleasure is no more an integral part of the experience than the judgment of taste which follows it. For a sense of enjoyment is felt in ourselves, it is not attributed to an object outside us. It is in fact a subjective effect of the various factors-sensuous, formal, or empathic-which the object exhibits to our contemplation. Genuine aesthetic pleasure is a pleasure deriving from these factors, and from nothing else. It is the peculiarity of its origin that distinguishes it both from the pleasures of the senses and from other mental pleasures. Much of the delight given people by art has, of course, nothing to do with genuine aesthetic experience. It often stems from personal associations, or from interest in the subject of the artist's work, or its technical treatment. A further objection to aesthetic hedonism is that our experience of art can be painful as well as agreeable. A tragedy hurts more than it pleases, and so do the mordant sature and grim realism of many modern writers. But although pleasure falls just outside the boundaries of the aesthetic experience itself, it usually accompanies its successive stages and suffuses the whole with a glow of agreeable feeling. The foregoing psychological analysis would give an incomplete account of the experience of beauty if I were to omit any reference to the structure of physical objects which provokes our subjective reaction and determines what it shall be. The very fact that some objects stimulate our sensibility, while others leave us unmoved, suggests that certain things possess an aesthetic virtue which others lack. We have noted the direct appeal of sensuous qualities such as light and colour and sound; but more important, and equally ubiquitous, are the qualities of emotional or conative expressiveness and organic form. The latter we have already pointed out in the spatial or temporal patterns traced by the fine and applied arts. The former is a suggestiveness of vitality and emotion through sounds, movements, and shapes, which either are in themselves, or at least resemble, the gestures and utterances we are accustomed to asso- ciate with the bodily expression of our inner life. Whatever else a 28</page><page sequence="12">THE NATURE OF AESTHETIC EXPERIENCE product of art or nature may express or suggest, such as ideas con- nected with a subject sculpted, painted, or described in words, is irrelevant from the strictly aesthetic point of view. The irrelevance of cognitive meaning enables us to appreciate primitive art while discounting the magical or spiritual significance it had for its con- temporaries, and to enjoy the religious art of every historical period and culture without sharing the creed of the artist or the ideology of the society in which he lived. Expressiveness, in this sense, and organic unity are thus the generic characteristics of aesthetic objects, and the particular form or expressive features of each work of art decide in practice what sort of experience-tragic or comic, graceful or grotesque, classical or romantic, abstract or naturalistic-we are entitled to expect. These two equally desirable aspects of aesthetic experience explain why beauty is not a tertiary quality of material objects, a quality as objective and measurable as their size, colour, or shape. And, at the same time, why it would be no less fallacious to maintain that beauty is purely subjective, residing in a special kind of feeling or its expression. For we have seen that aesthetic experience has two complementary aspects, subjective and objective, and that it consists of a fusion between these two components. Beauty is aesthetic experience, and this experience is itself a unique relation- ship between subject and object. I would not dissent at all from what Alexander once said in a posthumous lecture on values, "The value of beauty is thus eminently a relationship, as between the beautiful object and the mind which creates or appreciates; . . . how essential beauty is relative is seen from the constitution of the beautiful object itself, part given, part added by the mind.. . " This relation- ship can perhaps best be described as a disinterested satisfaction, creative or appreciative, in the sensuous qualities, the form, and/or the expressive content of individual objects. The outcome of this analysis fully justifies the common-sense opinion of artists and laymen, which has been called in question, that their aesthetic experience is different from the rest of their experiences of life. For it has shown that in the experience of beauty we established a relation between the mind and its object which always occurs in this type of human experience, and which differs toto caclo from our awareness of any other relationship. 29</page></plain_text>
