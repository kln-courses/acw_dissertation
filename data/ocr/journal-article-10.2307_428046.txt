<plain_text><page sequence="1">ART AND THE PUBLIC: EDUCATION FOR MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING* GILLO DORFLES In this essay I would like to summarize the present relationship between art and the public, and also to identify some of the causes of the uneasiness noticed in this field during several decades. I shall refer to social, religious, psychological, and ethical causes, as well as aesthetic ones. It is not true that the public has withdrawn from all art. Conversely, I be- lieve that we have never witnessed before such a "specialization" in artistic production as in the present day. It is no longer possible to speak of one music or of one poetry; several trends co-exist, opposed to and often ignoring each other. A large artistic field, which a very expressive German word defines as Kitsch, and which is the aesthetic diet of the great majority, is simply ignored by the connoisseurs. These do not consider the dime novel, the amateurish landscape, and the popular song worthy of a glance. In addition to this lowest art, there exists a vast area of "middle-brow" art, much diffused among the masses, which -even if scorned by the connoisseurs-is granted a certain respect. (Let us consider names such as Viki Baum, Bourget, Charles Morgan, Koestler, Stein- beck, and a hundred more.) There is now a stratification of taste and values, very different from what has existed in the past. It is true that in the past it was possible to see the co- existence of a style of a previous epoch and a new style of the current epoch in the process of affirming itself. (An example of this may be found in the middle of the seventeenth century when Borromini had already built his San Carlino, while in Rome they nevertheless continued to build "neo-Renaissance" churches such as Santa Susanna and San Carlo al Corso.) But this was a question of styles belonging to different epochs, not of a contemporary art intended for various cultural levels. I insist on saying "cultural" and not "social" because our present distinction in art, between good, mediocre, or bad taste, is tied in only a very limited way to a social cause; instead, it is tied to a cultural one. Churchill and his Queen like the kind of art which the avant-garde experts consider mediocre in taste and academic, while in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries princes and rulers protected the best in art, not the mediocre. It has never before been possible to conceive the co-existence of many differ- ent "kinds" of painting, such as post-impressionist, non-objective, surrealist, and very academic, without the least affinity among them. It is true that for some works of art, once reserved for the few, time has brought a certain popu- larity (Stravinsky, Kafka, Picasso), but those whose fate has remained un- changed, even after official recognition, are more numerous. Indeed we do not * One of a series of Matchette Foundation Lectures on the Philosophy of Art, presented in Cleveland in 1955. The previous lecture, on "Communication and Symbol in the Work of Art," was published in this Journal in March 1957, XV, 3, 289-297. 488</page><page sequence="2">ART AND THE PUBLIC 489 know if Schonberg, Webern, Proust, Joyce, Rilke, and Pound will become "popular," although one could speak of popularity from the very beginning in the case of Verdi, Puccini, Galsworthy, etc. The concept, the name itself of "popular art" is, indeed, of recent coinage. Thus, artistic classes are created whose values are subject to different ap- praisals. The very concept of art as unique, true, and good art of a particular historical period is falling apart, and this did not happen in the fifteenth century nor in epochs farther from us. To which art then shall we apply our judgment of good or bad taste? Which art is most distant from the public which must be educated for its appreciation? Today, there is more production and use of art than in any other epoch. In the last fifty years more art has been produced than in many past centuries. Surely all of these works are not masterpieces, but there is no doubt that the production of posters, comics, films, colored reproductions, newspapers, maga- zines, dance music, music on records, etc., has increased immensely. Man is surrounded by a real flood of figurations, sounds, and forms which we must define as "artistic," but whose value is extremely limited. Besides true art, there exists a very large portion of what Malraux' calls non-art or pseudo-art. Clement Greenberg2 likewise speaks about the relation between leisure and work in mod- ern society and about the various artistic categories intended for the different levels (high-brow, middle-brow, low-brow), according to a distinction based largely on economic-social factors. The increase of the "middle-brow level" in culture, but the decrease of the highest level (according to Greenberg) has caused true art to become an ex- clusive dependency of a very few, not even reaching the middle class, whereas the masses are fed only with "low-brow" art as it is supplied through radio, television, magazine advertisements, and comics. This is one of the most typical phenomena of our time whose solution is far from being clear. It is useless to claim that in the past also the artist created for the few, for the princes and popes, that his was an art for the l6ite. This art, when it came in contact with the people, was not refused but found prompt and enthusiastic acceptance. The examples are many. Let us consider only the case of the engravings and woodcuts of Diirer. It is known that the engravings were meant for a most refined and cultured public; in fact, they contained nu- merous mythological and symbolic allusions hardly understandable to the un- initiated. The woodcuts, however, were meant for the people and were sold right on the benches during market and fair days. But who would dare say now that the splendid plates of "The Apocalypse" are of an inferior artistic quality 1 Andr6 Malraux, "Art, Popular Art, and the Illusion of the Folk" (tr. W. Barrett), Partisan Review, XVIII (Sept. 1951), 487-495. 2 Clement Greenberg, "Crisi della nostra civilita," Aut Aut, No. 19. Greenberg believes that industrialized Western culture is divided into "low-brow," "middle-brow," and "high-brow," and that the cultural stratification no longer coincides with that of social classes as once was the case. The greatest economic support goes to the lowest level, the greatest social support goes to the middle one. He believes a positive solution to the prob- lem of high-brow culture can be found in the Industrial Age only in some good example of advance-guard architecture where the artistic realization coincides with the economic de- mand.</page><page sequence="3">490 GILLO DORFLES or of a different personal style than the copper incisions intended for the hu- manists, such as "Melancolia"? The concepts of talent, genius, and taste coincided. The disciples were in- ferior to the master only in degree of quality, not because of a substantial diver- sity of taste. Examples such as Diirer's are countless, and not because the public did not then understand "modern art." Undoubtedly the "old people" were always shocked by the art of the younger generation, but to a different extent and with different consequences. The jump between the two epochs was less pronounced than it is now. Around the end of the last century, we witnessed a real breach in art, like nothing in previous history. The transition of painting from the figurative phase to the non-objective, the transition of music from tonality to atonality, the passing of architecture from stone or brick construction to that of steel and concrete have indeed been remarkable jumps and have up- set, for many decades, the attitude of the public. Today, the largest portion of that breach is surmounted, but we must not forget that it happened. All our historical evaluation of art and our philosophical speculation must take it into consideration. The contrast between the taste of the public and that of the artist or the connoisseur was not sharp until the first half of the last century. If a separation of taste from style was already noticeable at the beginning of the nineteenth century, one can speak of a genuine breach only at the end of the century. The transformation of taste (equivalent to the succession of styles) was much slower in former times, being regulated by laws now hardly conceivable-the harmonic laws which forbade the use of consecutive fifth and eighth intervals, the laws of the unity of space and time in tragedy, the laws concerning architectural orders, and so on. There must have been a reason for the persistence of such artistic "laws." Their persistence, together with a belief in the possibility of codifying principles of proportion, symmetry, and rhythm, show the persistence of a fixed aesthetic situation for long periods of time. They were very often tied to magic, religious, and even political factors. Today, art tied to political and social factors is inferior art. (See the typical case of so-called "neo-realism" in painting; i.e., the academic reproduction of revolutionary scenes or arguments of social propaganda, developed in the last decades in the Soviet Republics.) Why? Because those religious, magic, and apotropaic functions which were once inherent in art have fallen and have been replaced by other functions equally vital. Unfortunately, much of our public still believes that some of those laws are valid and cannot be broken without hurting the quality of the art work. Let us consider the simplest cases, such as "life-likeness" in figurative art, the "re- production of the true" in pictorial perspective, consonance in music, and so on. Music lends itself particularly well to the illustration of this situation be- cause of its quality of an essentially "abstract," non-eidetic art, whose symbolism is almost never of a "representative" type, but is (as Langer suggests) a "sym- bolism of human sentiment." A breach did occur in music, however, even if less than in the other arts, as Brandi has noted.3 It occurred when the abandonment of tonality, or of "the center of tonality," gave freedom to an indistinct flow of 3 Cesare Brandi, La fine dell'avanguardia e l'arte d'oggi (Milan, 1953).</page><page sequence="4">ART AND THE PUBLIC 491 sounds, destroying the deeply imbedded concept of consonance. Today, there exist in music, more than in the visual arts and poetry, two distinct kinds of taste: one of the experts, and one of the uninitiated. If one wants to study the rapid transformations which have become established in "musical taste," one will discover how, in the absence of a specific "education in listening," an iden- tical aesthetic appreciation is almost impossible. Even jazz music which may seem the most pleasing is so because of our conditioning to such music. In the same way, perspective seems exact to us only by mere convention. Let us con- sider for instance some ancient melody, still written in sonorous systems remote from our harmony, codified in the eighteenth century, for example, the songs of the Arabs and of the Far East. Even some songs of Cilento (still alive in that peninsula at the south of Naples) are probably based on an ancient Greek mode. If we compare them to the common but pleasing Neapolitan songs, we will notice that these archaic and mysterious sounds, which are now appreciated only by the local people of these small, disappearing ethnic islands, seem to be extremely unpleasant and discordant to most people of the region, used to the popular song in dominant and tonic. On the other hand, they will sound effec- tive to cultured and trained ears, which are already used to the atonality of modern music. These monodies, surely "modal" (and thus completely different from the usual, tempered, diatonic system of the West), are often accompanied on the guitar with chords of the tonic, dominant, or sub-dominant system, ob- viously unsuited to the purpose. A similar case is that of the so-called "blue notes" of jazz, especially in im- provisations, where the "tonal hesitation" reappears, because of the derivation of such music from the five-tone African melodies where the half tone is unknown. Corresponding to the third and fifth of our tempered scale, there is a tendency to avoid the half tone. Consequently, we have that tonal indeterminateness which sounds so characteristic. We have here two examples in which a "popular music," created for the "masses," is able to assume artistic qualities for the elite, only by virtue of a dislocation in time and by maintaining a certain style of another epoch. For just this reason it appears "more modern." Such examples as the songs of Cilento and the "blue notes" of jazz are equiv- alent to what happens in the field of figurative art with the adoption by Western artists of the forms of African statues or idols of the Pacific Islands. One could say the same about much ancient and folklore music, such as the six-tone Hun- garian songs from which Bela Bartok drew with such abundance and skill. Another circumstance can enlighten us on the present crisis of art. This is the extreme expansion of the means of information. If this causes a flood of "good" and "bad" art, it also brings about the elimination of those barriers between peoples and continents which, in ancient times, permitted the flourish- ing of different artistic forms unknown to each other. The examples offered by antiquity of the contemporaneous existence of artistic forms belonging to differ- ent civilizations are no longer possible today. That of Castelseprio is typical. There, frescoes of the ninth century still retained Hellenistic characteristics at a time when Byzantine art was already widespread in the Italian peninsula. It is now almost impossible for an inhabitant of the world to ignore what is happen- ing elsewhere. The power of modern mechanical means to give extremely fast</page><page sequence="5">492 GILLO DORFLES information will cause the art of the whole world to develop on a single cultural level. We have been trying to demonstrate the existence of a "stratification of taste" according to different cultural (rather than social) levels. We must, at the same time, recognize a spreading out of artistic information among various countries. In the past, one could observe a universality of artistic creed (and therefore a unity of taste) in the span of a single cultural period-even in the presence of different isolated nations and civilizations. Today, we witness a spread of artistic forms, due to greater means of communication and, at the same time, a loss of universality within the same historical epoch and therefore a variety of tastes. Some of the factors responsible for the divorce between art and the public, and for the consequent misunderstandings of modern art, can be classed as social, ethical, technical, and psycho-sensorial. First, let us consider the social factors. I have already mentioned some of them, giving the example of the "laws" which according to Plato regulated the various arts. These laws evidently depended on a social factor. Another social cause is the present division into various classes of individuals, able to under- stand popular arts or the arts of the 6lite. I could also cite those negative ex- amples in which social or political interference by dictatorial r6gimes brought a deterioration of art as happened recently under nazism and fascism. The fa- miliar episode of entartete Kunst (degenerate art) in which Hitler classed some of the best modern artists, such as Klee, Kandinsky, Picasso, Mondrian, shows again the danger of intervention of state and politics in present-day art. But social causes are not limited to such intrusions of the state, acting ex- ternally to constrain the normal development of an artistic civilization. They include also the transformation of art in the changing of human attitudes and behavior according to the level of evolution reached in a certain epoch. The so- called periods of decadence and flowering of a civilization are not merely con- venient distinctions. Anthropological studies teach us that figurative art, for instance, may go through an abstract stage which often coincides with a certain level reached by a particular civilization. An interesting example is that of the famous Celtic coins made during the Roman Empire, which reproduced natural- istic motives of Roman coins in an abstract and emblematic form, evidently because of an impulse toward abstraction.4 Another example cited by Herbert Read is that of the Australian churinga5 (sacred stones on which an abstract design was carved). 4 Lancelot Lengyel, L'art gaulois dans les mgdailles (Seine, 1954). He also demonstrates that Celtic coins are not corrupted imitations of Roman models, but are examples of an ar- tistic spirituality and an artistic conception opposed to the anthropomorphic Roman one, and decidedly turned toward an abstract schematization. The carved images on the coins, also partially similar to the Greco-Roman models, display an entirely original plastic fantasy. 5 Herbert Read, Art and Society (London, 1945), p. 31. Here the semantic value of the mystic Australian stone is analyzed. Also, Langer speaks about the churinga in Philosophy in a New Key (Mentor Books, 1954), p. 121. She compares primitive thinking to the dream level: "the Australian churinga ... are . . . dream-symbols found and treasured in waking life."</page><page sequence="6">ART AND THE PUBLIC 493 The transformation of taste will often consist in an adaptation of the works of art to that formative process which guides and dominates the epoch, and which will largely depend on the social structure of the epoch itself. For each epoch we are able to verify the presence of an almost typical formal pattern: the triangle for the Egyptians, the square for the Greeks, the crescent for the Arabs, the pointed arch for the Goths, etc. Such formal necessity will vary with the changing of epochs, but should never be considered as something absolute, outside the history of society. Among the technical causes, the relation between the artistic medium and the art work is very close. The availability of new materials, not only in architec- ture6 but in music, painting, and sculpture, has often revolutionized art, creating in certain areas that breach with the art of the nineteenth century, harder to overcome than in the past. New techniques of reasoning have made possible new philosophical concep- tions closy relelated to the scientific, and, in the case of art, they have explained the advent of new expressive languages. The new mechanical techniques, on the other hand, have opened the way to new arts. The example of the film is sufficient. The motion pictures have certainly opened the way for an entire range of expressive possibility, allowing the popularization of literary, figurative, and sonorous elements. But they become affected by dangerous utilitarian and commercial aims. Thus, in the greatest majority of cases, the film is an example of bad art and, consequently, of the deterioration of taste, which, because of its immense possibility of diffusion, cuts deeply into all social levels. Finally, let us consider briefly the ethical and religious factors. The decline of religious art, in our time, is directly related to the decline of religion itself. This is not the place to analyze the reasons for its decline, but it is an established fact that during the last hundred years no religious painting has had artistic value except by mere chance. It is beyond our aims to consider if the scant religiousness of contemporary man may influence his artistic creativeness. The disappearance of religious art, which until the seventeenth and eighteenth cen- turies represented such a great part of the best painting, sculpture, and archi- tecture, is not without significance. As long as a religious basis held together the various social classes, forming a single basis for the taste of the prince as well as the pauper, it was harder to have a degradation of such taste. Today, religious art does not exist, or if it does, is not felt as such except by a small minority. The Church can hardly prevent this from happening. We know how vain have been the efforts of some inspired Dominicans, such as Fathers R6gamey and Coutourier, and of a few other priests, who attempted to introduce abstract art into the Church. Nor can the few examples of "good religious art,"7 such as Matisse's chapel in Vence or Le Corbusier's in Ronchamp, prove the contrary. 6 See the works by Lewis Mumford, chiefly Art and Technics, and Giedion's Space, Time, and Architecture. See also Gyorgy Kepes, Language of Vision (Chicago, 1946); and L. Mo- holy-Nagy, Vision in Motion (Chicago, 1947). 7 Cf. Peter Fingesten, "Toward a New Definition of Religious Art," College Art Journal, X, 2 (Winter 1951). Here a distinction between sacred art, religious art, and ecclesiastical art is considered and the evolution of the symbolic-iconographic material in Christian and pre-Christian religions is analyzed.</page><page sequence="7">494 GILLO DORFLES Among the artistic phenomena directly or indirectly connected with the ethos, one should not forget radio and television and, in general, "mechanical" art.8 By these mechanical means of reproduction, man is increasingly made to endure a pseudo-artistic work whose reception is only partially voluntary. Many in- dividuals rebel against the anonymous control of radio and television program- ming. Many try to select, or believe themselves to be selecting, the program. But there is no doubt that, through radio and television, people are served with music, comedy, dramatic spectacle, etc., whose artistic value is often mediocre and apt to condition their taste more than any other means. It is natural that radio and television should use especially a kind of easy art, pleasing to the ear, already tested and sanctioned by success (and this especially in the countries where these media are in the hands of advertising or of the state). We cannot expect these media to transmit the latest artistic productions, not yet appraised; but we must admit that the taste of the public can often be badly educated through them. There is another dangerous element in radio and television. This consists in two distinct factors: (1) the unwillingness of aesthetic appreciation, (2) the falsity of mechanical artistic reproduction. Never before has man been served, during meals, in the train, in a crowd, on the beach, etc., such a musical or pic- torial flood, often against his will. Although radio or television can be turned off or on at will, no one can deny that today, as never before, man is often un- willingly exposed to art. This is wholly unfavorable to art itself, which is not enjoyed with the attention or the religious interest of the past. And if it were true (as it appears from experiments performed under narcosis, and as Aldous Huxley imagined in his Brave New World) that man can learn during his sleep, without the intervention of his will, one cannot help seeing that the unwanted absorption of art, often mediocre, can deeply influence the aesthetic nature of man and indoctrinate his taste irremediably. This supports the belief that art, as presented by radio and television, loses a great part of its symbolic value, just as a religious function loses it when transmitted through these media, be- cause of the lack of the magic-creative participation of the spectator or the faithful. We have mentioned another harmful element: the falsity of mechanical ar- tistic reproduction. Radio and television have this in common with other means of mechanical reproduction, such as the phonograph, the reproduction of paint- ings, etc. Today, the world is flooded with artistic reproductions which even attempt to imitate the grain of the canvas and thickness of the colors, often achieving surprising effects. Such reproductions are not more or less successful man-made copies. They are mechanical replicas, manufactured in thousands of identical copies-sometimes inexact. Falsity is at the base of this reproductive element. At the beginning, through the normal and honest photograph, a great diffusion of masterpieces was made possible. But soon, what had been a reason- 8 For instance, the reviews Civility delle Macchine, edited by Leonardo Sinisgalli in Rome, and Stile Industria, edited by Alberto Rosselli in Milan. An interesting congress took place at the Milanese Triennale in the Autumn of 1954, concerned with industrial design and its aesthetic-philosophic aspects other than the technical.</page><page sequence="8">ART AND THE PUBLIC 495 able didactic medium, became deceit: a counterfeit of masterpieces, a tool for commercial purposes. If these are some of the ethical and aesthetic dangers presented by mechani- zation in modern life, we cannot help recognizing also the positive sides, made possible by mechanical and scientific progress. Actually, art must always reflect the conditions of life of the epoch in which it is produced, and there is no doubt that, for fifty years or more, a new formal area has been developing whose artis- tic value cannot be ignored. I am referring especially to industrial design-to that huge area of products mass-produced by machine, which range from elec- tric household gadgets to furniture, from utensils to scientific instruments, from the watch to the automobile. They represent an immense mine of formal ele- ments, partly replacing the products of craftsmanship and partly altogether new. In considering the panorama of modern art, we should not overlook this realm nor the similar one of advertising arts, graphic arts, and the different kinds of design. Industrial design already has a large international literature. The Museum of Modern Art in New York dedicates periodical reviews to it, and in Europe, too, specialized magazines are published which study this problem from the practical as well as from the aesthetic point of view.8 How shall we then consider these products? It makes no sense to long for the old days when Minoan and Inca amphoras, Persian rugs, and Chinese potteries were as beautiful as paint- ings or statues. Today, the industrial object has replaced the hand-made one. If we agree that it is impossible to make a clear distinction between "applied art" and "pure art," and if we consider modern architecture as "art," we must agree that the industrial object also is art. I propose, in fact, to accept it inas- much as its function leads the way to the creation of new formal patterns. Many industrial products present (they do not represent) forms whose re- semblance to those of modern sculpture and painting is obvious (Moore, Arp, Calder, etc.). This allows us to draw two conclusions: (1) fine art influences deeply the industrial product; (2) the industrial object influences fine art and helps create what I would like to call the "formative process" of our epoch. From what I have tried to explain, we can draw the conclusion that today there exists a formal constant in progress, and this constant manifests itself in the works of painting, sculpture, and architecture, as well as in those created by industry. It is this formal constant which keeps altering the taste of the public. Because of the formation of this new taste, the public of tomorrow will perhaps be more able to accept other manifestations of modern art which were hard to appreciate at first. For this reason, perhaps one can hope that, through an aes- thetic impulse, the world of modern mechanics may be redeemed by discovering in its own forms-at first merely functional-that beauty which art has lost elsewhere. This can also explain how and why taste which has deteriorated so much in the appreciation of the art work has been maintained and improved in regard to the style of the machine. We have only to ask a factory-worker his opinion about the shape of a new machine (an automobile for instance) and he will not hesitate to give it: not only considering the technical side, but also the aesthetic.</page><page sequence="9">496 GILLO DORFLES The same worker might not feel qualified to give an opinion about a modern statue (for instance a mobile by Calder or a "concretion" by Pevsner). He does not know that formal patterns are, more or less, the same, and that the same judgment can be applied to both: to the industrial as well as the artistic. Our age has produced new models, new patterns, which never existed before. They must possess that formative something which produces a healthy aesthetic judgment and therefore the arising of a new taste. Through the instinctive taste applied by the technician to his machine, and through education in seeing the work of art, we may find again that universality of taste which was the pre- requisite of better periods and which today is a thing of the past. It is useless to attack abstract art, twelve-tone music, cryptic poetry, or architectural functionalism, identifying them with harmful expressions of our civilization. On the contrary, such forms of art represent the only vital area on which we can rely, while artistic forms repeating schemes of the nineteenth century are nothing but the dead heritage of an outworn age. We agree on the seriousness of the crisis which afflicts our age. The only kind of art which can correspond to so serious a crisis (not only artistic, but ethical and social) is one which has lost the qualities of inter-subjective communication which were present in past epochs. On the other hand, it is not by blaming new artistic forms, or by closing our eyes to industrial design and graphic art that we shall be able to avoid the failure of a civilization and prepare the establish- ment of a better one. In this situation philosophy and aesthetics, when applied with knowledge and sympathy, can be of great service to the evolution of hu- manity.</page></plain_text>
