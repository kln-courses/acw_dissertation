<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> “There will be a new embodiment, in a  new way”: Alternative Posthumanisms in  Women in Love Deanna Wendel Indiana University This essay places Women in Love in dialogue with posthumanism in order to under- stand what kind of a nonhuman world the novel might be imagining when Rupert  Birkin declares that “ humanity is a dead letter,” and when characters alternately degrade  and idealize what they identify as the inhuman, superhuman, or extra-human. I argue  that Lawrence’s array of prefixes does not graft easily onto the “post” of posthumanism,  and that Women in Love constantly invokes, but never settles on a definitive answer  to Katherine Hayles’s question: “What kind of posthumans will we be?” Instead, the  novel enacts a series of alternative posthumanisms that, through their vexed encodings  of the human and humanist, direct us to reflect on the merits and limitations of our own  contemporary theorizations. Keywords: D.H. Lawrence / Women in Love / posthumanism “Humanity,” in the words of Women in Love’s Rupert Birkin, “is a dead letter” (65). What, then, shall replace it? Birkin’s declaration, I argue, begs to be placed in conversation with posthumanist theory,  from its monoliths like Donna Haraway and Katherine Hayles, to emergent  discourses such as queer posthumanism. However, only a few critics have yet  devoted attention to the interplay between D.H. Lawrence’s corpus and current  work in posthumanism, although they share myriad goals, dreams, and conflicts.  The commonplace subjects of posthumanism (animals, objects, machines) have  received ample attention in Lawrence scholarship, but under different — though  related — rubrics: animal studies, science and literature, or ecocriticism. If critics  have legitimate reasons for not branding Lawrence or his work as “posthumanist,”  despite identifying his interests in dismantling the binaries that posthumanism  likewise seeks to undo — nature/culture, mind/body, human/animal, subject/ object — those reasons are, nonetheless, valuable to make explicit. Of course, some readers, such as ecocritic Del Ivan Janik, have gone so far  as to hail Lawrence as not only inaugurating “the literature of environmental  </page> <page sequence="2"> Alternative Posthumanisms in Women in Love 121 consciousness” but also standing “at the beginning of the modern post-humanist  tradition” (74). From a science and literature perspective, Jeffrey Wallace explores  Lawrence’s development of an “antihumanist (or posthuman) humanism” in order  to defamiliarize long-held conceptions of Lawrence as anti-science (8). In many  respects, I take Wallace as a starting point, while critiquing Janik’s romantic  version of posthumanism — to be posthumanist, after all, is not necessarily to  be environmentally conscious nor to fully “reject humanism,” as Janik states  Lawrence has (78). However, I do see precisely such ecological romanticism  poignantly, if problematically, reflected in characters such as Birkin.1 Like Wallace, I use posthumanist theory to conduct a “rigorous dialectical  analysis” of the human itself, but through the lens of a plurality of posthuman- isms (8). Women in Love imagines not one, but a series of unstable terms for the  non- or after-the-human: what’s sometimes a desire for the overarching term  of the “inhuman” is at other times the “superhuman” or “extra-human.” I take  this trio of favored prefixes as a (loose) organizational structure for this essay,  devoting a subsection to each, tracing which versions of posthumanism might  best find themselves in Lawrence’s theorizations. Taking a cue from Judith  Halberstam and Ira Livingston, I believe that other prefixes to the human do  not necessarily compete (nor benignly align) with the posthuman, but rather, as  the authors state in Posthuman Bodies, that “the ‘post’ of posthumanism interests  us insofar not really as it posits some subsequent developmental state, but as it  collapses into sub, inter, infra, trans, pre, anti” (viii).2 In the case of Women in  Love — in, super, and extra. I use the more traditional post initially, with some caveats, to frame Birkin’s  understanding of a temporal and teleological “new embodiment” after the human,  aligning the character’s assertion with certain utopian valences of posthumanism.  Lawrence uses both in and non to refer to animals in the text, using oppositional  terms to the human. Undermining Birkin’s efforts to be “posthumanist,” the  novel frequently emphasizes human/animal difference — most prominently, if  ironically, in Ursula’s efforts to treat animals humanely. The prefix super appears  in connection to Gerald’s coal mining “machine,” while sub embodies the other  “spatial” and also potentially evaluative term that describes the transformative  effect of this machine on the colliers themselves. Extra appears in the text only  once (but crucially) in relation to Birkin’s hope for an ideal romantic relationship  that could be a vehicle for finally “transcending” the human. Lawrence’s constant re-prefixing renders Women in Love well-suited to reflect  on the discourse of posthumanism, the “post” of which has made for, as Cary  Wolfe notes, a befuddling word that often “generates different and even irrec- oncilable definitions” (xi). Lawrence’s new prefixes depict such multiple visions  that resonate as posthumanisms, rather than a unified definition or “field.” As  Katherine Hayles has suggested, posthumanism is less a question of to be or not  to be; rather “the question is what kind of posthumans we will be” (246, italics  mine). I examine Women in Love’s incessant invocation of this question, while  arguing that it never decides on a satisfying answer. Rather, the novel’s multiple  </page> <page sequence="3"> 122 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 answers betray its dissatisfaction with any one of its propositions, each of which  can be unraveled into composing humanisms.3 Of course, these distinctions are not as cut-and-dry as this divisive structure  of subsections (post, in, super, extra) may make it appear. One has to recognize  Women in Love as an entangled web before attempting any foray into interpreta- tion, taking into account the novel’s propensity to adamantly state the opposite  of a claim that, on the previous page, it asserted with fervor. This, too, is human.  As Graham Holderness proposed in an analysis of Women in Love in 1986, “criti- cism should not assist the text to achieve false ideological coherence, but should  rather deny that completeness” (128). I agree with Holderness that an attempt  to repair Lawrence’s ideological rifts would be both an injustice and a falsehood.  Such “denial of completeness” can be critically productive for readings of post- humanist theory as well. These prefixes, then, are partly interested in reifying some of what stubbornly  remains human/ist in Lawrence’s characters, despite their declarations of helpless  or willful breaks from humanity. More important than whether or not Women  in Love “is” posthumanist is its inspired mapping of desires to be. Channeling  Holderness, my conclusion proposes, then, not that posthumanism is deluded  with itself or a fruitless discourse (as some critics have rather bluntly stated) but  rather that its value rests in its own incompleteness. The novel’s consistent failures  to theorize the nonhuman(ist) point to the desires and limitations of our posthu- man imaginaries, ultimately calling more for a new, or different, humanism than  for a post- state. Birkin’s Posthuman Dreams Though Rupert Birkin is not the only character in Women in Love who declares  his wishes to get beyond the human, he is the only character who consistently  engages others in dialogue about humanity’s nature and anticipated end. He is  hardly subtle about his feelings: he states, in one of his usual vague iterations,  that “Humanity is a dead letter. There will be a new embodiment, in a new way”  (65). Birkin’s search for an embodiment to replace not only “the human” but also  the collective humanity that he particularly despises may be the most legitimately  posthuman desire in the novel. As Katherine Hayles claims, posthumanism places  itself at odds with the Foucauldian emphasis on “bodies” and instead emphasizes  “embodiment,” which foregrounds individual enactments of what it could mean to  be human, while the “body,” even if variously marked, invokes a normative model  (196–7). I suggest that we take both Birkin’s and posthumanism’s imaginings of  new embodiments seriously, but not as a real present or feasible future in which  we can say that we are no longer human. In fact, Birkin’s adamant desire not to  be human proves itself to be all too human. It would be tempting to read Birkin as the “messenger” of either posthuman- ism or at least an alternative to humanist anthropocentrism, as some understand- ably have. While never using the word “posthumanist,” Gerald Doherty reads  </page> <page sequence="4"> Alternative Posthumanisms in Women in Love 123 Birkin in this vein as “an idiosyncratic apostle of a biocentricity that foregrounds  the animal body” (71). A “biocentric view” that sees human and nature as equal  “partners” is also what Ivan Del Janik deems posthumanist in Lawrence (72).  Birkin’s perspective speaks to the “post” of posthumanism in the sense that he  sees humanity as having run its course: “if mankind passes away, it will only mean  that this particular expression [of the incomprehensible] is completed and done.  . . . Let mankind pass away — time it did” (65). Birkin sometimes prophesizes the  “post” as the complete end of humanity rather than a less humanist “embodiment”  of it. At other times, his dream merges Darwinian discourse with religion in a  bizarre evolutionary schema.4 At the end of the novel, he muses from particulars  to generals while gazing at Gerald’s corpse: “The eternal creative mystery could  dispose of man, and replace him with a finer created being. Just as the horse has  taken the place of the mastodon” (595). Birkin stands passively back from the  human and the new “embodiment” seems here to have nothing to do with what  was once the human. It is its replacement, just as the mastodon and the horse are  not “related” either. At other points, Birkin’s perspective is actively misanthropic: “his dislike  of mankind, of the mass of mankind, amounted almost to an illness” (66). The  “post” fantasy, for Birkin, constantly slips into the aggressively anti-human. Birkin  is happy to find a fellow misanthrope in Mrs. Crich, when the family hosts the  Luptons’ wedding party, and they momentarily connect. However, despite their  shared opposition to the human, Mrs. Crich puts Birkin on the spot in asking  him to qualify his views, in a rich dialogue worth examining in full: “People don’t really matter,” he said, rather unwilling to continue.  The mother looked up at him with sudden, dark interrogation, as if doubting his  sincerity.  “How do you mean, matter?” she asked sharply.  “Not many people are anything at all,” he answered, forced to go deeper than he  wanted to. “They jingle and giggle. It would be much better if they were just wiped  out. Essentially, they don’t exist, they aren’t there.”  She watched him steadily while he spoke.  “But we don’t imagine them,” she said sharply.  “There’s nothing to imagine, that’s why they don’t exist.”  “Well,” she said, “I would hardly go as far as that. There they are, whether they  exist or no. It doesn’t rest with me to decide on their existence. I only know that I  can’t be expected to take count of them all. You can’t expect me to know them, just  because they happen to be there. As far as I go they might as well not be there.” (23) This enigmatic dialogue is stunning in its seemingly non-sensical gesture  toward issues that have great import for posthumanism many years later. The pas- sage employs Karen Barad’s key terms in Meeting the Universe Halfway — “mean- ing” and “mattering” — loaded words that, Barad notes, “entangle” ontological,  epistemological, and ethical senses (3). Mrs. Crich’s question, “How do you mean,  matter?” demands that Birkin make transparent his use of language, which he is  </page> <page sequence="5"> 124 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 clearly uncomfortable doing (he’d rather leave the premises for meaning/matter- ing at face value) — but on another level, things that “mean” or have “meaning”  also physically (have) “matter” (3). Birkin realizes that his own dismissal of the  human might not matter if he cannot explain his logic. Mrs. Crich’s skepticism  suggests she knows that she and Birkin are not sharing a lexicon. To say people  “don’t matter” means potentially A) they’re of no consequence to me (Mrs. Crich’s  own eventual dismissal) or B) they have no inherent value. It could also potentially  indicate C) that humans have no true “substance” at all. The first possible reading  is clearly an ethical assertion, but on the third and to some extent the second lev- els, the issue is also an ontological one, the stakes of Barad’s meaning/mattering.  What would it mean to say, as Birkin does, that humans actually do not exist? It is  their physical matter that Mrs. Crich cannot help but notice, as she fills cups and  plates at the dinner party, where the theory and practice of saying that humans  don’t matter clash. “They are there, and that’s a nuisance,” she dryly remarks (24). Birkin’s and Mrs. Crich’s perspectives valuably help negotiate the distinc- tion between a “meaningful” anti-humanism and a different trajectory of mis- anthropy grounded in wounded individualism and the anomie of the subject.  Such anti-humanism may be part of the posthumanist agenda that attacks lib- eral humanism’s history of abuses of both nonhumans and denigrated groups of  humans. Of course, Birkin’s repulsion at humans who “ jingle and giggle” makes  his explanation nothing short of absurd. However, Mrs. Crich’s attempt to make  Birkin account for the conditions that would make humans matter or not matter  is a crucial question for posthumanist theory, as it asks how we can make a value  judgment of our “ism” frameworks. The ethical question of whether or not “people matter” also may contain a  threatening shade of eugenics, which critics have read in Birkin’s claim that the  world would be better if humans were “wiped out.” Wallace points to this dark  side of posthumanism in claiming that “the human in eugenics is always-already  posthuman” because of its assumptions of human essence-lessness, alterability,  and manipulability (155). Wallace discusses eugenics in the context of Lawrence’s  work at large, and my reading of Gerald’s brand of posthuman cyborgianism (the  “superhuman”) explores how posthumanism could, in an extreme derivation,  devalue the human under “a totalitarianism whose extreme logical conclusion is  the policy of genocide” (155). Although generally Birkin’s vision of the posthuman  is utopian, his contempt in this passage is not exempt from the seeds of such a  dystopian posthumanism, even as his reason for humans’ non-mattering — they  “ jingle and giggle” — prompts laughter. Birkin, then, serves as a problematic figure who exemplifies posthumanism’s  own vexations. As readers, we are asked to take his philosophy somewhat seri- ously, if only due to its page count. However, we should be cautious of unquestion- ingly accepting such dogma. Even Birkin admits that his words are insufficient,  effectively “deorganicizing” himself: “I was becoming quite dead-alive, nothing  but a word-bag” (226). Characters tend to view Birkin as a source of ridicule just  as often as they find his words profound. In the key classroom scene, when Birkin  </page> <page sequence="6"> Alternative Posthumanisms in Women in Love 125 usurps Ursula’s role as teacher, and lectures her schoolchildren on the anatomy of  the catkins flower, he ends with an irritated audience. Both Hermione and Ursula  leave “hostile and resentful,” and Birkin has even been emasculated by a laugh  from Hermione, “ jeering him as if he were a neuter” (45). While Ursula and Hermione critique Birkin — through the laughter that  jousts him, temporarily, from his teacherly presumptions — Birkin’s backlash  toward Hermione is still more scathing. Birkin may be ridiculous, but Hermione  (he says) is a hypocrite. In an argument that parallels some posthumanist cri- tiques of other authors’ humanisms, the lovers wage an argument over the merits  of scientific education, as well as the supposed tension between hermeneutics  and “direct connection” with nature. Hermione asks Birkin whether this human  knowledge is worth its price: “Hadn’t [the children] better be animals, simple  animals, crude, violent, anything, rather than this self-consciousness . . . ?” and  asks “If I know about the flower, don’t I lose the flower and have only the knowl- edge?” (42). Hermione’s romantic view of nature as “the real” that also posits  science as a destructive force may resonate with posthumanism in the ecocritical  sense intended by Del Janik. Such a perspective frustrates Birkin not so much because of its content, which  he seems to advocate often enough, but because it does not rightfully seem to  issue from Hermione’s mouth. Birkin is left no option but to take on the role of  antagonist in the argument. In frustration, he eviscerates Hermione for being in  bad faith about her embrace of animality: You are merely making words. Knowledge means everything to you. Even your  animalism, you want it in your head. You don’t want to be an animal, you want to  observe your own animal functions, to get a mental thrill out of them. It is all purely  secondary — and more decadent than the most hide-bound intellectualism. What  is it but the worst and last form of intellectualism, this love of yours for passion and  the animal instincts? . . . only you won’t be conscious of what that actually is: you  want the lie that will match the rest of your furniture. (43) This false, “mental” interest turns away from the animal (and from the inner  animality of the human that Doherty refers to) back upon the observer. The  emphasis on the human’s supposed animality instead becomes a vain self-reflec- tion that Birkin deems “that Lady of Shalott business” (44). “You’ve got that  mirror,” he says, “your own fixed will, your immortal understanding, your own  tight conscious world, and there is nothing beyond it” (44). Birkin’s critique of  Hermione enacts Barad’s own mirror metaphor for “reflexive methodologies” that  comprise a dangerous humanist way of both doing science and being in the world,  which she draws from Haraway. For Barad, the reflexive mode ultimately rein- scribes a liberal humanist subject position, and she proposes in its stead a “diffrac- tive methodology” that is more “attuned to the entanglement of the apparatuses of  production [of agential cuts]” which, unlike the mirror-relationship, “does not fix  what is the subject and what is the object in advance” (30). Hermione, in Birkin’s  laceration of her, claims to be interested in a Deleuzian becoming-animal, but  </page> <page sequence="7"> 126 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 really is only interested in imagining herself as “other” and then “observing [her]  own animal functions” — making a common humanist error of splitting the self  into a pleasurable subject/object division. This renders the animal neither actively  entangled with the human, nor “integrated” in Doherty’s sense, but a passive  object of the Cartesian mind’s “gaze.” In their attempts to understand and avoid “animalism in the head,” Women  in Love and much work in posthumanism run along parallel tracks. The novel’s  appraisals of various invocations of animals as serving anthropocentric, human- ist projects of figuration is one sense in which Women in Love can be thought of  as posthumanist, which often entails an oppositional framework that defines the  (wrong kind of) humanist. I am not suggesting that Birkin’s critique of Hermione  frees him from making the same “error” of reflexivity he claims she does, nor that  the theorists pinpointing other theorists’ anthropocentrisms are exempt from  their own. Birkin’s perspective as “word-bag,” after all, brings his own status into  question. Contrasted with the finer gradient of humanist/nonhumanist distinc- tions that Cary Wolfe offers, Birkin draws a not-so-subtle dualism between what  he likes to think of as his and Hermione’s approaches to animalism: that of “real  sensuality” versus visual “pornography” of “looking at yourself in mirrors, watch- ing your naked animal actions” (44). In a heat of passion, he tells Hermione that,  if there’s anything animal-sensual in her, the only way to get there is violence: “If  one cracked your skull, perhaps one might get a spontaneous, passionate woman  out of you, with real sensuality” (44). Ironically, though, it is Birkin who eventually has — quite literally — his  skull cracked by Hermione, who in a fit of rage bashes him with a lapis-lazuli  paperweight. This trauma leads to what could be read as the most nonhumanist,  “real sensual” experience of all the scenes in the novel. Leaving Hermione’s house  and stumbling out into the countryside after his injury, Birkin, “barely conscious,”  finds a grove of fir-trees and flowers. Finding that “he wanted to touch them all,”  “he took off his clothes and sat among the primroses” moving against them until  “he seemed to saturate himself with their contact” (124). However, in finding  “they were too soft” for his liking, Birkin moves to the fir-trees and “beat his loins  with their clusters of soft sharp needles,” a sensation he deems “more beautiful  than the touch of any woman” (125). In a scene more bizarre than a few short  quotes can illustrate, Birkin praises the lovely “responsive vegetation,” an image  of human/nonhuman contact that even our most transgressive posthumanisms  do not seem to have envisioned. So does this fir-tree scene actually get us anywhere, or does this new “ques- tion of the plant” still seem less important to us than that of the animal, in the  context of the celebration of all the hybridities, fusions and entanglements that  define certain branches of posthumanism? Or does the nonhuman connection  Birkin seems to achieve here, even calling the fir-tree grove “his marriage place,”  another ecological primitivism of the cringe-worthiest kind? (126).5 Although  animals have drawn ample attention in Women in Love and Lawrence scholarship  at large, the plant seems to concern very few, in relation to the much-read scenes  </page> <page sequence="8"> Alternative Posthumanisms in Women in Love 127 of animal/human encounters. It seems, after all, that most of our posthumanist  theory is not so much anthropocentric as it is animal-centric (or in other variations  machine-centric). Gerald Doherty’s understanding of Birkin as biocentric apostle,  however, would benefit from being placed in this context of bios as concerned with  more than just animal life. This is one sense, perhaps, in which Birkin can expand  our definitions of posthumanism and its range of human/nonhuman entangle- ments. However, we cannot ignore the dystopian elements and possible costs that  attend Birkin’s understanding of both the human and the posthuman. nonhuman animals, the inhuman, anD the inhumane While I have just noted that “animalcentrism” is prominent in posthumanist  theory, for this reason it is worth turning briefly to the animals in Women in Love,  in order to ask to what extent this emphasis on nonhuman life — which Lawrence  also calls the “inhuman” — can be said to be posthumanist. As this topic has been  amply discussed already, with the effect of polarizing critics, I take as a starting  point the critical milieu that has already inquired to what extent Lawrence’s ani- mals can be understood as “real.” This section deals explicitly with theory’s as well  as Women in Love’s objective to find a nonanthropocentric way of understanding  the animal. I take some issue with the laudatory readings that have claimed that  Lawrence can be thought of as “biocentric,” as well as a reception of Lawrence  that initially hailed his work as embracing the “real being” of animals. I argue  that we cannot say the text succeeds in actually doing this, but its failures are  poignant ones, and that posthumanism would be well-suited to reflect on such  textual failures, including its own. Just as Haraway critiques theorists like Derrida and Deleuze and Guattari  for making real animals subservient to larger philosophical projects, and Birkin  demeans Hermione for her mirror logic of “animality,” Lawrence critics have  long been divided on whether or not Lawrence can be said to be concerned with  “real” animals. Some, like Graham Hough, wrote as early as 1956 that Lawrence’s  nature poetry in particular breaks from a tradition of “passive appreciation” in  an attempt “to penetrate into the being of natural objects, to show what they are  in themselves” (201). Sounding like a proto-post-humanist, Hough writes that,  “[Lawrence’s work] has little to do with common human subjectivity; it is an  attempt to put common human subjectivity in its place by showing the myriad  of queer, separate, non-human existences around it.” Likewise, Lawrence was  applauded by some of his contemporaries for seeing animals in themselves. W.H.  Auden claimed that Lawrence’s legacy would not be his understanding of human  relationships, but rather his “genuine visions of plants, of animals, of certain  passionate states” (51). (Note that Auden does not forget the plant). For Auden,  Lawrence loved animals not as objects but as “neighbours” (48). However, many  other critics have examined the extent to which Lawrence’s animals never quite  become real, remaining “analogues” for the human or mediums for the transla- tion of human desires.6 Amit Chaudhuri, for instance, presents Lawrence’s poetic  </page> <page sequence="9"> 128 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 depictions of the nonhuman, in Birds, Beasts and Flowers differently than Auden,  as a play of signifiers always attentive to “the gaps between the [animal] thing  that is named . . . and the description which is supposed to identify it and ‘bring  it to life” (60). For Chaudhuri, “the word or name — ‘bat’ or ‘snake’ — remains, to  a large extent, textual, and does not simply and unproblematically travel off the  page towards life and the landscape” (60). As Doherty’s reading suggested, there is perhaps another method that  involves making divisions between characters, without stating that Lawrence is  humanist or posthumanist. We have, in Doherty’s reading, the biocentric Birkin  and Ursula who embrace (their own) animality and Gerald and Gudrun who  “effectively corral it off in their desire to negate and destroy it” (69). Gudrun’s  and Gerald’s violence is not against merely inner specters of animality but real  animals, too. In an oft-critiqued scene, Gerald forcibly holds his frightened mare  within inches of a passing locomotive, while Ursula and Gudrun watch from afar.  Wallace reads this scene as one that “stages the relationship between technology  and nature as contestatory,” while it simultaneously “horrifies the watching Bran- gwen sisters” (34). It is Ursula’s later confrontation with Gerald over the horse that  marks her, for Wallace, unlike Doherty, not as biocentric “human animal” but as  a humanist subject with “passionately humane responses” (26). Ursula’s language  conflates animal rights with human rights, despite her own oft-stated “repulsion  for the human.” However, Wallace’s reading of the horse/train scene also levels  out Ursula’s and Gudrun’s own initial reactions (grouping the sisters together as  “horrified”) when it seems that Gudrun’s response, along Doherty’s lines, begs to  be read as distinct from her sister’s. Gudrun’s horror toward Gerald’s treatment of the horse actually appears to  participate in it by making “the mare” into an object of imaginative sexual trans- ference; she cannot stop thinking about “the strong, indomitable thighs of the  blond man clenching the palpitating body of the mare into pure control” as he  brings the mare into “soft-blood-subordination” (133). As Doherty points out, in  both this and the shared violence against the animal that is the attempt to remove  the rabbit Bismarck from his cage, Gerald’s and Gudrun’s erotic desires for each  other are narratively triangulated through a form of sadomasochistic behavior  toward animals.7 For Doherty, Gerald and Gudrun are caught in what Derrida  deems a humanist carnophallogocentric “culture of sacrifice” of the animal body,  a claim which I would not dispute, but I would ask to what extent Ursula stands  outside of the anthropocentrism that underpins this culture (71). When Gudrun,  on a shared walk, calls a robin “a little Lloyd George of the air,” Ursula initially  agrees about the resemblance, but then “there came the revulsion”: “After all, it is  impudence to call them little Lloyd Georges. They are really unknown to us, they  are the unknown forces. . . . How stupid anthropomorphism is! . . . The universe is  non-human, thank God” (323). While Birkin critiques “animalism in the head,”  Ursula critiques humanist anthropomorphism. However, Ursula forgets, when she  mentally reproaches Gudrun for not recognizing that robins are fundamentally  “inhuman” and “of another world,” that it is on these same grounds of treating  </page> <page sequence="10"> Alternative Posthumanisms in Women in Love 129 the animal as other that Gerald justified his behavior toward his mare. Horses,  Gerald had explained to her, may have a “will” but no “mind” as humans do, and  in fact, it was Birkin who qualified this by relating them to women, claiming that  both women and horses have “two wills,” one to subordinate and the other to rebel  (290). How much of the animal as the subject of conversation and debate is lost  when Birkin suggests its humanist figuration of women, we might ask? I have attempted to draw out a double bind in that both those humans who  do violence to animals and those who actively seek not to are concerned with  this shared end of seeing animals “in themselves,” rather than reflections of  humans — or Hermione’s mirror logic. However the same “othering” stance can  easily be read in radically different ways. To foreground an animal’s alterity can  be read, on the one hand, as an admirable refusal to take an anthropocentric  stance, but on the other, as an anthropocentric reflection of the human’s anxiety  that there might be any underlying similarity. To see animals as not different,  however, in order to talk about equal rights, despite good intentions toward ani- mals, draws attention to the beneficence of the human who extends the rights,  and seeing “sameness” in the animal risks a humanistic reflection mode. None- theless, the characters like Gerald, who insist that animals should be recognized  as fundamentally different from humans tend also, in Women in Love, to do the  most harm to animals. This is even though their impulse might seem laudable for  avoiding the kind of liberal humanist “incorporation” strategy of pluralism that  Cary Wolfe refers to, of extending subjectivity to groups who have previously been  on the fringe of it (99). Although Ursula interrogates the “inhumane” treatment  of animals in a way that invokes the considerable place of activism and animal  rights in the current posthumanist conversation, the novel also undermines these  concerns by leaving open the question of whether animals in this novel, or in  literary texts at all, really “are” animals, as opposed to “animalism in the head”  or only animals-on-the-page. Ursula occupies a troubled position — her defense  of animals would apparently lend itself to the biocentric and posthumanist — but  it is hard, the text implies, not to be humanist when insisting on the humane  treatment of animals. the suPerhuman anD suBhuman While animals may take center stage in much posthumanist theory, the cyborg  represents another staple figure, which speaks to Gerald in Women in Love. As  already established, Gerald is in no danger of being considered posthumanist in  the sense of his fusions with animals; his “couplings” with his horse or Bismarck  are more likely to be considered irredeemably humanist dominations of nature  than posthuman transgressions that emphasize kinship. Gerald is not a cyborg  of the kind that Donna Haraway’s “Cyborg Manifesto” calls for: “a creature in  a post-gender world” from which “we can learn from our fusions with animals  and machines how not to be Man, the embodiment of Western logos” (172). He  is still very much “the embodiment of Western logos”; Gerald’s fusions of the  </page> <page sequence="11"> 130 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 human(man) and machine are not the pleasurable frisson sort of “dangerous pos- sibilities” that the cyborg holds for Haraway, but rather just the dangerous kind,  a “superhuman” at odds with Birkin’s imagining of a utopian posthumanism. As Barbara Mensch and others have argued, Gerald highlights a totalitar- ian impetus in the novel: “if there is an ‘antagonist’ in the novel, it is Gerald,  the exponent of mechanical order, who feels he must rigidly control all that is  spontaneous in the human being” (72) I would argue that totalitarian drive is  inextricable from his goal to become a “mechanical” posthuman, to view all things  as potential extensions of himself, in a vast extension of humanist mirror logic.  As the so-called “God of the machine,” head of an increasingly mechanized coal  mining production, Gerald also collectively dehumanizes his workers. Conceiving  of “the pure instrumentality of all mankind,” he revolutionizes his father’s business  to maximize profit, introducing new machinery and cutting workers. Without  qualms, he dismisses “the whole democratic equality problem as a problem of  silliness”; in which the non-mattering of individual selves serves as the basis for  his impersonal philosophy, in which only the “great social productive machine”  bears weight (276). Forms of “sentimental humanitarianism” denoted by “wid- ows, those stock figures [of sympathy]” must be done away with, which includes  cutting benefits to relatives of miners and introducing machinery that becomes  more human than the humans themselves, serving as “great iron men” (279).  The workers he does keep largely run new machines, and in that sense become  cyborgs themselves. Yet I do not want to reductively present Gerald’s world as an apocalyptic  anti-human dystopia — indeed, utopian possibilities collapse into the dystopian  elements, even for the colliers: “. . . the work was terrible and heart-breaking in  its mechanicalness. . . . There was a new world, a new order, strict, terrible, inhu- man, but satisfying in its very destructiveness” (281). This world represents “the  most wonderful and superhuman” (281). Thus, while Birkin dreams of getting  beyond the human, Gerald (in a very different register) already has, while under  the banner of the “superhuman,” as both what is simultaneously most human  and exceeding the human. He reiterates an inherent humanism that conceives of  the other — machines, animals, and for Gerald, also women — as instruments,  as opposed to the likewise problematic reflection-of-oneself humanism branded  upon Hermione. What is at once “terrible, inhuman” is simultaneously “won- derful and superhuman.” Gudrun, too, fetishizes the colliers’ human/machine  hybridity: “In their voices she could hear the voluptuous resonance of darkness,  the strong, dangerous underworld, mindless, inhuman. They sounded also like  strange machines, heavy, oiled” (135). If the machine does not seem to justify my  reference to Gerald as cyborg — for admittedly he seems to occupy a particularly  humanist place in the midst of the machine as its organizer — he admits that the  longer he runs the business, the more “perfect” his industry has become, and the  more he feels his own superfluousness in it. Gerald is no longer the Cartesian  mind that runs the system-as-body, but a rudimentary organ that has outlived  its usefulness. Here is a human who finds that he no longer has any place in a  </page> <page sequence="12"> Alternative Posthumanisms in Women in Love 131 posthuman world of his own creation, who lives in fear of becoming “a purely  meaningless babble lapping around a darkness” (282). Leaving behind this particular nonhuman vision, the finale of the novel finds  our four lovers together in the Swiss Alps, a common vacation spot that the narra- tive renders strangely ungrounded in time or space. It presents an abstracted world  of snow and ice that is largely devoid of life, a place where Gudrun says one feels  wonderfully “ubermenschlich — more than human” (488). Increasingly, for Gerald,  it looks like he has arrived at the state of finally transcending all that is human,  including his previous cyborg dys-utopia. At the same time, the “super” suggests  that somehow his breaks from humanity make him a human ideal, more in the  tradition of the human overreacher than any other character. It seems that, from  his very introduction in the novel, in which he was conceptualized by Gudrun as  a “smiling wolf,” and “pure as an arctic thing,” he has reached the cold place that  the language of the narrative has destined him for, while the others are far from  home (11). But here the animal metaphor of the wolf fuses problematically with  Gerald’s simultaneous growth into the inorganic or mechanic. Pulling a tobog- gan through the snow, he forgets that Gudrun is present on the sled and becomes  “one” with the moving object, making no distinction between its matter and his;  “it seemed to him the flying sledge was but his own strength spread out, he had  but to move his arms, the motion was his own” (521).8 If the animal “inhuman”  is conceived throughout the text as idealistically embodied, then the cyborg,  as Hayles might say, is in danger of being framed as so hyper-embodied (an  expanding, ever-permeable network) that it risks mischaracterization as actually  “disembodied” and immune to its own frailty. When Birkin and Ursula have left the Alps, and Gudrun is growing increas- ingly close to Loerke, Gerald takes more often to the more comforting inhuman- ity of the hills, tiring of love and life, for on his skis, he could be “more like some  powerful, fateful sigh than a man, his muscles elastic in a perfect, soaring trajec- tory, his body projected in pure flight” (521). So Gerald spends his final days, in  the fancies of losing his body, before his attempted murder of Gudrun and his  own death alone in the mountains, a warning-sign to any would-be cyborgian  posthumanisms of the “disembodiment” variety that Katherine Hayles cautions  against. If Birkin’s claims about human and posthuman “matter” merit empathy  as well as laughter, remaining relatively harmless, then Gerald’s “super-human”  offers the most troubling, most dystopian version of a follow-up to the human, one  that gives us greater reason to be attentive to our constructions of the posthuman. the extra-human, or the Power of love Having examined the dangers of the “superhuman” posthumanism in Women  in Love, and the less glaring humanist blemishes in the prefixes “post,” and  “in,” I hope to offer one last proposition that might seem surprising in relation  to the insight the novel has to offer regarding humanisms-within-posthuman- isms — the way the novel vigorously imagines human love as an alternative means  </page> <page sequence="13"> 132 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 of “becoming posthuman.” The novel tries to propose sexuality as an avenue for  characters to attempt to write themselves out of human being. My final claim,  then, is the inverse of Wallace’s, who asserts that in Lawrence’s novels “sexuality is  the primary mode of the ‘hard struggle to come into human being’ ” (158). Instead,  I am interested in how Birkin engages in the practice of imagining a particular  relationship that could exceed the human, whether or not this is achieved. At this point, it will make sense to turn to a second “dead letter” from Birkin  that exists alongside, and along with, the dead letter that he says is “humanity.”  Just as posthumanism tends to take as a starting point a Cartesian mind/body  split, and its dependence on the “I” that thinks, apart from the body, Birkin  also asks, “How could he say ‘I’ when he was something new and unknown, not  himself at all? This I, this old formula of the age, was a dead letter” (458). What  prompts this meditation from Birkin, however, is not precisely the question of the  “I think” of the cogito, but its relation to those little words Ursula needs him to  say: “I love (you)” (458). When he utters them, he is thrown into disarray, realizing  “it was not the whole truth . . . How could he say ‘I’ . . . ?” (458). As Birkin interrogates the “I” that gives unity both to the body it “owns” and  gazes upon the world as something separate from itself, so too individuated love  doesn’t seem to work anymore either. Birkin lambasts Ursula throughout the novel  for her naiveté in “the old way of love”: “he would rather not live than accept the  love [Ursula] proffered . . . he wanted something clearer, more open, cooler, as  it were. The hot narrow intimacy between man and wife was abhorrent” (240).  Critics such as Carolyn Tilghman have read this as dissatisfaction with prescribed  forms of heteronormativity, “courtship rituals, marriage and home life,” and also  with the form of the domestic narrative itself (90). Tilghman asserts that Birkin’s  relationship with Gerald is to serve as an antidote to this narrative, but ultimately  fails and does not offer a “workable corrective” “to the perceived evils visited on  human beings by the domestic narrative and its maternal power base” (107, 108). Although Tilghman interestingly notes that these “evils” are seen as affecting  the general category of “human beings,” she does not explain why this word choice  might be particularly telling. Although scholars have written about homosexual- ity and the anti-marriage ideals of the novel, few have noted how from its onset,  the nonhuman permeates even that most human ritual of marriage. Marriage, a  few pages into the novel, is disrupted by the “animality” of the bride and groom,  who break from their walk and chase each other to the altar. It becomes instead a  violent “sport” in which the groom flies to the church, “his supple haunches work- ing like those of a hound who bears down on the quarry” (17). As the wedding  bells ring, Ursula wonders about the connection between human marriage and  its impacts on a universal or collective nonhuman consciousness: she “wondered  if the trees and the flowers could feel the vibrations and what they thought of it”  (20). Importantly, not only has marriage been “ecologized” or “animalized” in a  more expansive context, but it has become a spectacle to be witnessed more than  it is a ritual the sisters wish to participate in. It has aesthetic interest, even as it is  becoming questionable, obtuse: “Shall we go out and look at that wedding?” (6). </page> <page sequence="14"> Alternative Posthumanisms in Women in Love 133 Thus the “problem with humanism” collides with the problem of the tra- jectory of the realist romance novel’s plot, in an only half-hearted attempt at  modernist break from that tradition. This traditional plot might end in enforcing  a limiting conception of the human: two (heteronormative) liberal humanist sub- jects sever themselves from the world and from other possible couplings. Birkin,  of course, eventually marries Ursula, despite constant professions of his other  longings and in one chapter, his own Baradian “entanglement” with Gerald in  ju-jitsu (“a tighter, closer oneness of struggle . . . a strange, octopus-like knotting  and flashing of limbs”) (331). The final words of the novel indicate Birkin’s regret  for the foreclosure of any relationship with Gerald, one which he had wished he  could have outside of his marriage to Ursula. An ideal love, one which even Birkin  and Ursula seem to flicker into at times, is neither exclusive nor ego-based: “there  was no I and you, there was only the third unrealised wonder, the wonder of not  existing as oneself . . . [but as] a new paradisal unit regained from the duality”  (458). Like Birkin, Ursula informs Gudrun that she has reached the conclusion  that “love is too human and too little. I believe in something inhuman, of which  love is only a little part . . . it isn’t so merely human” (544). Gudrun, however,  asserts “Well, I’ve got no further than love yet,” refusing to be post-romance (544).  This dream of a “new paradisal unit” that Birkin imagines holds some hope of  being an entanglement of two humans — rather than his other erotic “marriage”  to the fir trees, which for all its utopian possibility, proves, as one might imagine,  to be infeasible and ultimately unsatisfying. Birkin’s skepticism toward the possibilities of marriage becomes, with the  human, one of the most common objects of his derision throughout the novel — the  two frequently intertwine. Marriage’s “time,” like that of the human, is up. Of  course, in opposition to this marriage and this vision of a shared household where  “the human” becomes “humans” husband and wife is Birkin’s dream of a love  between two men: such a love can still only be conceived by the text as “extra- human” (450, italics mine). This designation of some form of non-heteronormative  relationship as outside the human is, of course, problematic, in its invocation of a  history that wielded exclusion from the human and inclusion in other categories  (such as the animal or object) as a foundation for terrible abuses. However, here it  is the human itself that is denigrated, and non-membership romanticized. Birkin cannot answer the question of himself and Gerald, though he tells  Ursula “It’s the real problem I can’t solve. I know I want a perfect and complete  relationship with you . . . and we’ve nearly got it — we really have. But beyond that.  Do I want a real, ultimate relationship with Gerald? Do I want a final, almost  extra-human relationship with him .  .  . or don’t I?” (450). It is useful here to  return to the moment of Gerald’s death, and as Birkin looks at Gerald’s corpse, it  consoles him to move from the loss of the particular (the man he loved) to the gen- eral, dreaming that “the timeless creative mystery would bring forth some other  being [than the human], finer, more wonderful, some new, more lovely race . . .  new forms of consciousness, new forms of body, new units of being” (595). Over  the corpse of Gerald, Birkin dreams a posthumanity in the true “after” sense of  </page> <page sequence="15"> 134 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 “post.” Yet the body of Gerald elides this; it does not even seem human at all and in  Birkin’s memory it reverts to a recollection of animality. He can only recall “a dead  stallion he had seen: a dead mass of maleness, repugnant” and Gerald’s last look  does not resemble “the beautiful face of one whom he had loved” but “this last,  terrible look of cold, mute Matter” — a horrifying lack of any remainder of once- human-ness (596). This is the human reduced only to physical “matter,” Barad’s  ontological level, with the epistemological and ethical questions surrounding  Gerald’s death stripped from the picture. Death, after all, is truly posthuman. Thus this last “extra-human” has iterated perhaps the most humanist posthu- manism, in the part of Lawrence’s novelistic world grounded not in radical break,  but in a romantic novel tradition. The novel devotes itself ultimately to marriages  and domestic strife as possibly the site for its own paradoxical transcendence of  the human, if only love could be done “right,” which might just demand a queer  posthumanism. In fact, as some have argued the extent to which posthumanism  is always already queer: as Livingston and Halberstam state, “Driven instead by  the double impossibility and prerequisite to become itself, the posthuman body  intrigues rather than desires; it is intrigued and intriguing just as it is queer: not  as an identity but because it queers” (14).9 However, it is important to note that  in Women in Love, the queerness remains as a desire and that the transcendence  of the human it promises does not come to pass. Birkin has the last word (so  maybe posthumanism can have Birkin as “spokesman” or “messenger” after all)  in response to Ursula’s assertion that it’s “impossible” to have “two kinds of love.”  The novel’s, and Birkin’s, stubborn response “I don’t believe that,” concludes, like  my reading of the logic underlying the novel’s array of posthumanisms, with both  denial and lingering possibility. the “new” human We can think of love in Women in Love, then, as the final lens for considering  (a different) humanism. The romance novel’s inherited generic “problem of love”  aligns, for Birkin, with the problem of the human; the possibility of individual  love has been problematized by posthumanism’s own skepticism toward the  Cartesian self. The version of love structured on the marriage ritual and the  heteronormative model of the nuclear family is designated by Lawrence as the  most restrictive liberal humanist formula yet, even above the cyborg’s extension  of all things as instrumental matter, or characters’ anthropocentric treatment of  animals. But rather than reconfigure what counts as acceptable human love, Law- rence envisions the ideal combination of relationships as something that would  result in radically transcending the human. Lawrence constructs the Birkin/ Gerald relationship as, ideally, a vehicle for becoming posthuman, through the  male/male love that Birkin conceives of as “extra-human.” In this sense, Lawrence  envisions the possibilities of a queer posthumanism, but this “extra-human” — like  the other prefixes — tragically does not come to pass. This amorous posthuman- ism, as I’ve argued our theory does, remains in a state of lyric potentiality. My  </page> <page sequence="16"> Alternative Posthumanisms in Women in Love 135 understanding of Women in Love is likewise that it is not (yet) able to dispense with  the human or with humanism, for better or worse — that it imagines, ultimately,  a world that is not quite posthumanist but posthumanish. I have argued that the novel’s array of prefixes, from “super” to “extra,” do not,  in the end, graft easily onto the “post” of posthumanism. The “post” itself often  serves to level out a wide range of differences — differences that Women in Love  illuminates — between heterogeneous hybrids of humans, animals, machines,  plants, and objects. While this essay has traced the text’s posthuman imaginaries,  it is with a consideration of their failures to stick, as well as their vexed encodings  of the human and humanist. We might nonetheless still be tempted to call this  novel posthuman, but if we do, it may be wiser to think in terms of “posthuman- isms” rather than “posthumanism.” As Halberstam and Livingston state, “there is  no ‘best’ representative of the posthuman. Posthumans have been multiply colo- nized, interpenetrated, constructed — as well as paradoxically empowered — but  neither virtue nor vice attaches automatically to this multiple position” (10). Nor,  they clarify, does the posthuman “necessitate the obsolescence of the human” (10).  The versions of the posthuman in Women in Love, then, do not ultimately cancel  each other out, nor do they transcend the humanism the text also contains. The rhetoric of this particular posthumanism is framed similarly to what  could be considered a call for a “new humanism,” or perhaps humanism with a dif- ference. Critics such as Warren Montag, Nancy Armstrong, and Neil Badming- ton have gestured toward such a jumping-off point for reconsidering the human  rather than endorsing its end. Armstrong and Montag suggest that we “trace the  limit of the human in its current state” while not necessarily embracing Foucault’s  prophesizing of its disappearance (2). They ask whether the human could itself  be imagined differently, crucially severed from the liberal humanist subject — the  assumed pairing that much posthumanist theory, like Birkin, tends to see as  indivisible (4). Badmington similarly critiques posthumanism, but sees it as an  insightful framework nonetheless for reflecting on the human. He interrogates the  ways in which the human continually “haunts” the posthuman, constituting its  inherent “remains,” or Derridean traces that cannot be easily eradicated (12, 13).  Posthumanist scholarship then becomes uniquely positioned to attend to these  remains and to “take the form of a critical practice that occurs inside humanism”  (22). If, in this analysis of Lawrence, we similarly decentralize Birkin’s initial  posthumanist perspective and take Mrs. Crich’s instead, Women in Love asks us to  confront that concrete remainder of humans: even when conceptually dismantled,  still, “There they are, whether they exist or no” (23). Acknowledgments I would like to thank Richard Nash for comments on this piece in its development. I am also indebted  to Scott Herring, Jess Waggoner, and Kelly Hanson for their perpetual insight, encouragement, and  invaluable feedback throughout multiple drafts of this essay. </page> <page sequence="17"> 136 Journal of Modern Literature Volume 36, Number 3 Notes 1. Other ecocritics have responded with some skepticism to Janik’s claim that Lawrence helps to  initiate an era of literary posthumanism. Garrard asserts that the common “dark green reading”  of Lawrence has glossed over “the struggle with questions of power, gender, sexuality and religion  that early posthumanism involved” in his study of throughlines between Lawrence and Nietzsche  as problematic figures that ecophilosophy has embraced (10). 2. Giffney and Hird also point to the tendency of prefixes to the human to “melt” or slip into each  other: they note “other configurative prefixes —  ‘in’ and ‘sub’ also work here” but ultimately choose  “non” because they believe it best demonstrates how categories can become normative even when  “necessitating a relation fabricated on negation, denial, resistance and rejection” (2). 3. Cary Wolfe’s distinction between “posthumanist” and “posthuman” is significant here (xv). It  has everything to do with the crucial question of what part of the word “posthumanism” that “ism”  shackles itself to, whether it believes that we are beyond the conceptual framework of humanism  or actually beyond the human. Also note that many of the writers who are called “posthumanist”  do not think of themselves as belonging to any such an “ism” or “ist,” as Haraway has stated (When  Species Meet 17). 4. For work that places Darwin specifically in conversation with Lawrence, see Granofsky (2003). 5. The reading of Lawrence as advocating a return to nature from an oppressive industrial civi- lization has long been a staple reading in deep ecology. See LaChapelle’s largely celebratory D.H.  Lawrence: Future Primitive (1996) for one of the first that posits Lawrence as “primitivist” in this  sense. 6. See Wright (1961), one of the first to claim that the animals in Women in Love are primarily  symbolic or analogical parallels to the human pairs. 7. While I bracket these issues, there is a fascinating question of humanist/posthumanist perspec- tives surrounding the artistic representation of animals in the novel. The battle with Bismarck is  initiated by Winnie’s desire to draw him, while Gerald’s pun on how he’d rather “draw him and  quarter him” speaks to a violence of representation that has some share in the physical violence to  come. Gudrun’s miniatures of animals could likewise comprise another essay altogether, in addition  to her relationship with fellow-artist and so-called “creature” Loerke. 8. See Duffy (2009) for further theoretical and historical context that might elucidate Gerald’s  fascination with speed, which Duffy calls the most “modern pleasure.” 9. In addition to Halberstam and Livingston, for work on queer posthumanism (a burgeoning field),  see Giffney and Hird, as well as MacCormack.
