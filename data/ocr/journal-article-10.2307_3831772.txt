THE GENRES AND GENDERS OF SURREALISM. St. Martin's Press, 1999. ix + 166 pp. illus. $49.95. No other book available in English discusses all the genres of Surrealism and the role of women in the movement. In addition, this book places Surrealism within the cultural history of Modernism, and in its later chapters (Chapter 6 on Leonor Fini and Dorothea Tanning and Chapter 8 on Caryl Churchill, Robert Ashley, and the Wooster Group), it traces the legacy of Surrealism into the contemporary world. For these reasons, Annette Shandler Levitt's book is invaluable to scholars and critics of Modernism, of Surrealism, and ofthe role of women in avant garde art-movements. The first chapter, "An Introduction to Surrealism/Modernism, and All That Jazz," defines Surrealism sensibly and broadly as "destabilization ofthe unconscious, achieved through vital, open-ended techniques and genres," so that the reader can see the inherently "expansive aspect of both Surrealism and the Modernism within which it grew." To make a surrealistic critical formulation of my own to convey Levitt's rich insight, each is both inside and outside the other at once. Chapters 2, 3, and 4 discuss, respectively, the new spirit of Apollinaire, Cocteau, and the synthesis of the arts they proposed; Artaud, Vitrac, and the cruelty of theatre they created and put on; and, in a tour de force of suggestive critical analysis, Andre Breton's classic novel of Surrealism, Jacques Lacan's model for his Ph.D. dissertation, Nadja. Here is Levitt's succinctly brillant judgment on Breton's attempt to fuse word and image in his text: "Breton desires Nadja, mystical link to the unfettered unconscious, the male author's conduit to his female side. But he undercuts his own verbally expressed quest with photographs that attempt to reassert male authority, reinforcing the conflict between his desire to know himself fully and his ultimate rejection ofthe personal vulnerability required for such self-knowledge. The photographs, along with Breton's vaunted scientific tone and other distancing devices, aim to establish the narrator as uninvolved objective observer." Such a narrator would be the ironic</page><page sequence="6">546 Journal of Modern Literature antithesis of Proust's, hence Levitt's title for this chapter: "The Modernism of Andre Breton's Nadja: Pas 'Pas Perdus.'" Chapter 5, "The Horses, Birds, and Crones of Leonora Carrington," the neglected British artist and sometime writer who practiced her own unique brand of Modernism informed by Surrealistic aesthetic principles, serves as a perfect counterpoint to Breton, and the pivot of Levitt's book, as she turns in the final chapters to what the main title of Chapter 6 terms "Women's Work" in Surrealism. In the turn from Breton to Carrington, Levitt succeeds in demonstrating her book's major claim that Surrealism is a singular Modernist movement in the arts ofthe twentieth century that was not only a new way of envisioning the world but also a full-blown philosophical stance in creative rebellion against that world, particularly its ruling society. Annette Shandler Levitt's The Genres and Genders of Surrealism is a major achievement of scholarship and criticism, which should become the standard work on the topic. DTO Lyon, Janet.

Oxford University Press, 1999. xvi + 320 pp. $55.00 cloth, $19.95 paper. The editors of this excellent collection of multidisciplinary essays on the Middle Passage and its aftermaths in re the African/African American experience in "the master's brave New World" should be credited with achieving exactly what they set out to do: "The volume . . . embraces a collectivity defined by difference, by a multiplicity of visions; it is an endeavor to deal creatively with complexity and multiplicity." It is thus framed by two evocative poems?James A. Emanuel's "The Middle Passage Blues" and Melba Joyce Boyd's "Transatlantic Passages Revisited, Tenerife"?and introduced in each of its parts with a cogent essay that embodies its multidisciplinary nature. Rendering even more effective this compendium of papers delivered at the Collegium for African American Research's 1995 conference in Tenerife is its use of poetic excepts from works of Robert Hayden and Vernon Reid as imaginative windows into its three major sections: "Voyage through Death," with new and important literary, anthropological, historical and statistical approaches to the traumas and horrors of the Middle Passage; "To Life upon These Shores," with similarly comparative and multidisciplinary studies of "the process in which the involuntary black pioneers appropriated the unfamiliar . . . , transforming the continent by their very presence and reinventing themselves as African Americans"; and "In Africa, There Are No Niggers," with its seminal essays dealing with African Americans' reassessment of their relationships to and images of Africa in their process of understanding their Diaspora and "The Enigma of the Return." Final commendations should be extended to the editors and the authors of all the pieces in</page><page sequence="13">General Studies 553 this volume for engaging in such creative and scholarly dialogue?the kind that produces works of the highest quality?and committing themselves to ongoing projects at such key places as CAAR, Harvard's W.E.B.

Put in verse form by Melba Joyce Boyd, we retrace with swollen fingers and jagged hope empowered by the anger of a volcano and the reverberation of a turbulent age haunting human pursuits to be of some value.

This is an interesting and unusual long essay, approaching feminist theorizing in a striking fashion, in which I am perhaps too interested and implicated. Writing directly and with a personable authority, Salvaggio proposes a renewed poetic literacy in her study of essayistic texts of feminist writing?the literacy of close listening (in Charles Bernstein's phrase). She offers a survey of writing that works not by metaphors of sound but by a kind of "remainder" or "presence" of sound itself, texts that argue their propositions inside language, using language evocatively, with "thick and overlapping meanings," not as a neutral vehicle for ideas. The critics and writers whom she chooses are often situated on a borderline between critical and creative writing or are poets: Gloria Anzaldua, Olga Broumas, H?lene Cixous, Susan Griffin, Susan Howe, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva, Trinh Minh-ha, Elizabeth Meese, Nancy Miller, Patricia Williams, and some others?including the writer of this brief notice, whose Pink Guitar is often evoked. The writers are interestingly organized by tendency?including queer writing, poetic writing, narrative writing, but Salvaggio shows their common project: a serious engagement with the ways in which language constructs evocation and with the ways in which sound catalyzes thought and feeling. Salvaggio is distingished by her judicious assessment of certain cliches sometimes present in feminism?the evocation of</page><page sequence="26">566 Journal of Modern Literature the "feminine," the "personal," exclusivist claims (that this kind of writing is only lesbian, for example), and other sentimental ideas.

This is not the sort of Twayne study that we have become accustomed to. It is not only longer but also much broader in its approach. Some of the credit for this must go to Twayne and to Herbert Sussman, editor of its new Critical History of the Novel series; but most of it must go to Caserio, who brings a rare breadth of knowledge and of sensitivity to his task. Rooted deeply in literary theory, Caserio offers here fine, close readings of individual texts, an openness to the Modernist novel as a form, as to many of its British practitioners, both to its masters and to those less well known, and a healthy skepticism about some of the more recent theoretical and critical pronouncements on his subject. His central thesis "is that any theory or history of modernism must come to terms with the role chance plays in all modernist instances." Chance?Caserio calls it "'tychism,' from the Greek tyche "?provides both "opportunity and obstacle" to Modernism's "totalizing impulses." He begins, naturally enough, with Conrad's Chance, goes on to Lawrence's Lost Girl, concludes this first part of his study with Woolf's The Years. The readings are sensible, convincing, totally undoctrinaire. Indeed, Caserio confronts the doctrinal. In a chapter called "Various Modernisms"?the title itself a denial of doctrine?he warns against the "critically fashionable . . . charge [against] modernism [for] having, at best, a neutral, withdrawn relation to social change and to the public dimensions of history." Then, at the opposite end ofthe period, he refutes some ofthe "intellectual imprudence of programmatic descriptions and endorsements of postmodernism." How can an admirer of the Modernist novel not admire such freedom from cant? But the cliches of Modernist criticism, too, are put to the test: John Cooper Powys is read as a Modernist (with a considerable debt to Joyce), as is Arnold Bennett ("a remarkable</page><page sequence="30">570 Journal of Modern Literature modernist experimenter in the forms of historical fiction"); in readings of "gender-coded fiction," after considerable discussion of theoretical views, there are equally interesting readings of Dorothy Richardson (whose Pilgrimage is described as "one of the supreme achievements of modernist English fiction"), Sylvia Townsend Warner, and Elizabeth Bowen; even here he upsets expectations: "It is hard to avoid the idea that modernist novels, with their continual experiments in shifty conjunctions and disjunctions, with their self- consciousness about the question of their autonomy and history, precisely illustrate the New Historicist paradigm." Caserio concludes with politically rooted readings of "Imperialist Kipling, Labourite Woolf, [and] Liberal Cary," and then with readings outside history, as it were, of Graham Greene and Henry Green. The breadth of the whole is admirable, the authority and critical independence even more so. Few critics in the field could have produced such a book. MPL Cazenave, Odile.

Rutgers University Press, 1999. ix + 175 pp. $48.00 cloth, $17.00 paper. One would like to share, without any reservations, the enthusiasm expressed in Rutgers University Press's release in re this seminal book, which "offers readers of African American poetry a way of understanding and appreciating a body of work that has received little critical</page><page sequence="36">576 Journal of Modern Literature attention. . . . Performing the Word is an important contribution to the understanding of African American culture and American poetry as a whole." Indeed, in design and to a considerable extent, in realization, this study comprehends the vernacular speech sources of African American poetic language, ranging from their roots in orality to the various and marvelous ramifications of folk literature, spirituals, blues, jazz, preachment, popular music, and the like, that have enhanced the richness of some of the major (Afro) American artists in the history of this country. As an (Italo) American poet who has been deeply influenced by African American music (blues, jazz, rock) and poetry (Langston Hughes, Amiri Baraka, Haki Madhubuti), I am amazed that it took so long for a work such as Brown's to appear in print and delighted to have such a text to which I can direct my students. My main doubt about this crucial critical work relates more to its form than to its content. I am surprised to see a book published by a university press that still sounds too much like a doctoral dissertation, with its often distracting references to all the literature published on a given theme rather than a development in the author's own words; it does not develop in sufficient depth the important poems treated in each chapter; and evinces stylistic and syntactical problems that a good editor could have easily resolved. Forgetting one final issue about which I have composed a tome (The Poetics and Literature ofthe Sicilian Diaspora)?if all speech is inherently poetic and if, therefore, all oral narrators are "natural poets"?I am particularly impressed with Brown's conclusion that "African American poets extend vernacular expression into the literary. Their poetic language exists within a continuum of language practice embedded in the performative and expressive practices that constitute African American vernacular culture." Such folk orality and performance has always been the stuff which classics (Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, and now Walcott, Hayden, Brooks) are made of. Justin Vitiello, Temple University Corcoran, Neil.

Intended both as an historical and critical introduction to Yiddish theatre in America and as a repository of plays for performance, God, Man and Devil offers a tradition little known today except as nostalgia. But its flowering, if brief, was quite wonderful. What fascinates most, it seems to me, is the parallel between the development of Yiddish theatre in modern times and that of European theatre in the past. "By 1950," Sandrow writes, "in less than one century, Yiddish drama had managed to telescope and recapitulate much ofthe development of Western drama." Remembering some of those who loved the Yiddish theatre, I wonder how Kafka might have enjoyed some of these New World plays and which of them my parents might have seen.

Michigan State University, 1999. 425 pp. $25.95. I must admit that I have always admired the short story and the novella as forms. I have, indeed, considered that Bellow's fmest achievement is Seize the Day; this masterpiece is wonderfully constructed?it lacks the somewhat tedious ideas of Herzog,th&amp; rambling journeys of Augie March. Thus, I am pleased to see the publication of this collection. The "small planets" discussed include deep explorations of such relatively unknown stories as "Dora" and "The Gonzaga Monuments" and the more recent The Bellarosa Connection and The Actual. There is no discussion of Bellow's latest work, Ravelstein (published after this collection was finished). I wonder how this work fits into the genre of novel or novella. I should point to my favorite readings?readings which range from the deconstructive analysis by Phillip A. Snyder of Zatland to the brilliant, dense analysis by Alan Lelchuck (an accomplished novelist) of "What Kind of Day Did You Have?" to the wonderrul analysis by Elaine Safer of comic irony in A Theft and The Bellarosa Connection. Although I mention only these three essays, I recommend all ofthe readings because the authors refuse to believe that Bellow publishes scraps from larger novels?or uses them to get ready for the novel. It is time to evaluate value in terms of both small and large planets. I salute the editors. This collection forces readers to re-evaluate Bellow's fiction and the merits ofthe novella and the novel as forms.

University of South Carolina Press, 1999. xiii + 247 pp. $24.95. Peter Wolfe has written a complete and sharp study of the English writer, Alan Bennett. Bennett's work includes plays for the theatre and television, screenplays, and prose pieces for newspapers, magazines, and collections. His themes are social class, history, duality, sexuality, the Kafkaesque quality of modern life, and?most importantly?the humor and pathos of being human, with all the flaws and bizarre moments that come along with that condition. Bennett has been at work since the early 1960s and is as popular and revered in Britain today as any living writer. In Understanding Alan Bennett, Peter Wolfe deals with each part of Bennett's work with admirable care and explanation. He manages to strike a happy balance between introducing Bennett and helping readers to understand him. If I have any qualms at all about the study, it is that Wolfe tends to avoid discussions of Bennett's sexuality (often evident and important in his works), and the employment of a specific kind of British camp that has been instrumental in helping him to mix social messages with humor, thus making them more insidious and more successfully passed along.</page><page sequence="47">Individual Authors 587 Alan Bennett is one of those curious Englishmen, one of a breed that could not be found or accepted any where else. He is from Northern England, separated from the hotbed of culture and society in London (the great north/south divide is still very evident in the British class system); he is clearly Socialist in a country where even the left wing looks to be centrist; he espouses a gay sensibility, and is loved for it by the general public; and he is vulnerable and self-effacing. In short, he typifies the strange mix of contrasts and ambiguities that the British have made it a tradition to embrace. This makes him even more appealing than he would have been had he fitted into a traditionalist mold. In short, even if he is full of contradictions and confusions, he is still perhaps the most recognized and admired writer of plays for the stage and television, and screenwriter of movies, currently working in England. He is both popular and critically acclaimed-never an easy balancing act. Part of his success has been to emphasize such confusions in himself as well as his country, seen no more clearly than in the recent stage production of his play The Lady in the Van, in which Bennett appeared as a character. It seems fitting that the Alan Bennett in the play was played by two different actors who were on the stage the whole time, each playing one part of Bennett's personality: the practical, rational Bennett, and the uncertain, emotionally fraught Bennett. (This production has been staged since Peter Wolfe wrote this book?discussion of it would certainly make a valuable supplement to a future edition.) Peter Wolfe understands these contradictions and confusions. He explains Bennett's works in great detail?this is highly necessary, because so few of them are available to American audiences?and finds in them personal and social issues that have always been at the core of Bennett's work. Even in his early work with the revue troop, Beyond The Fringe, Bennett's work was sharp and satirical. If anything, he has mellowed over the years, allowing a more considered and interior approach to become the medium for his message. He has managed to master the comedy, giving us some priceless moments in the Talking Heads monologues and the film A Private Function, for example, but he has also found ways to express great heart and pathos. Having seen The Madness of George III on stage and on screen, I can think of no more moving moment than the king in the throes of illness putting himself into the restraining chair and waiting for the straps to be tightened. Bennett seems fascinated by duplicity in all of its forms: madness masquerading as sanity and the reverse; homosexuality acting heterosexuality; working class aping the elite; government men who are really spies. Wolfe looks at all of these aspects of Bennett's work, taking in his television plays, his work in the theatre, his screenplays, and some of his prose writing (Bennett's Writing Home is a superb collection available in the United States). In many ways, television has always seemed to me to be Bennett's most successful home, maybe because it allows an intimacy of setting and of watching that focuses the viewer on the details in his work?the faces, the voices, the small gestures of everyday life that he understands so well. It is also the place where he has most successfully employed his muses, most notably Maggie Smith and the wonderrul Thora Hird. Bennett, like all playwrights and screenwriters, needs performance, and so much ofthe humor and bite in his work comes from the voice, the production of accent, and the exquisite timing that these actresses in particular have been able to give to his words. Reading the scripts of Bennett's plays and screenplays will not give the sense of the wit and delivery of these specific instruments that Bennett has used over the years. Hird's performances, understated, but full of acidity and warmth in equal measure, have become a national treasure in England, and Bennett knows how to use her skills to deliver his words and ideas. This is not to say that he has limited himself to these actresses over the years. He gave Nigel Hawthorne the role of his illustrious career in The Madness of George III and used Coral Browne, playing herself, and Alan Bates, as the spy Guy Burgess, to great effect in An Englishman Abroad. It is a mark of his position in the English theatre that, in the Single Spies double bill at the Royal National Theatre, he could have an actress</page><page sequence="48">588 Journal of Modern Literature (Prunella Scales) playing the part of Queen Elizabeth II in A Question of Attribution. To put the reigning monarch into a play was daring enough, but to have her expose the duplicity of the spy Anthony Blunt during a highly intellectual and challenging discussion about art was a masterstroke. I felt that I had an advantage when reading Peter Wolfe's very thorough and complete study of Bennett's work because I have seen so much of the material he discusses here. His discussions and summaries of Bennett's works brought back a lot of memories, both personal and cultural (it is not often that can be said about a critical work). Growing up in the United Kingdom meant that Alan Bennett was very much a part of the cultural landscape I encountered. I remember watching the series of six one-hour dramas on London Weekend Television at the end of 1978 and into 1979, and I especially remember Me, I 'm Afraid of Virginia Woolf. In this play for television Bennett wrote about a sexually confused middle- class night-school teacher, Trevor Hopkins, who fails in love with his working-class student, Dave Skinner. As Wolfe points out, Bennett provided the voice-over for the play, but didn't actually appear himself. He uses surrogates to play out some of the confusions of self and society, something that he has continued to do ever since. I remember the impact the play had on me when I saw it, and I have spoken to many people since who found watching it in some way a defining experience for themselves. By enabling us to watch Bennett/Hopkins find a way to accept himself and his desires, and in breaking through the still-stringent barriers of social class, Bennett achieved more in one hour that some politicians achieve in a career. He has continued to challenge, question, explore, and comment. Alan Bennett is never strident or demanding. He entertains with wit and wisdom, humor and sadness, and always with a deep conscience and feeling for the humanity of his characters. At the end of his informative and insightful study, Peter Wolfe writes that "Alan Bennett's writing conveys a sense of anger both controlled and transcended. He can describe ugliness without becoming its spokesperson. His instinct for wholeness also saves him from taking refuge in phony happy endings and conventional moralities. Any writer like him whose honesty and freshness of perception can point to a brighter future deserves serious attention." Keith Gumery, Temple University JOHN BERRYMAN E Smith, Ernest J.

This volume (the third in a series honoring Borges, born in 1899), is, perhaps, even more valuable than those devoted to his poetry and fiction. The selections are relatively unknown; a third have never before been translated into English. Thus, we see other sides of this master. This volume contains essays?film reviews, capsule biographies, book reviews, essays on Dante, learning, lectures, and prologues to works by other writers?which are always surprising and informative. On King Kong: "To keep him from looking the least bit extraordinary, they make him do battle with the more unusal monsters and have him reside in caves of false cathedral splendor, where his infamous size again loses all proportion." (Note Borges' interest in monsters, in the notion of proportion.) On the Kabbalah: "One is my almost complete ignorance of the Hebrew language; the other, my desire to defend not the doctrine but rather the hermeneutical or cryptographical procedures that lead to it. The procedures, as is well known, include the vertical reading of sacred texts, the reading referred to as boustrophedon (one line from left to right, the following line from right to left), the methodical substitution of certain letters of the alphabet for others, the sum of the numerical value ofthe letters-" (Note the fascination with the text, the occult divination of meaning.) Surely these examples, ranging from a B movie to an esoteric religious commentary, demonstrate Borges' fascination with secret shapes of reality. IM JANE BOWLES E Skerl, Jennie.

"T've decided I don't want to be a postmodem literary theorist,'" announces the hero of Byatt's latest novel, The Biographer's Tale, and he seems to be speaking for the author as well. Her satires of critics from deconstructionists to feminists in Possession: A Romance</page><page sequence="51">Individual Authors 591 (1990) are well-known. It is surprising?and uncomfortable?that she appears to be so earnestly trying to theorize about literature herself (all the while claiming that she is not doing so) in her latest critical book of essays. To be fair, the book came into being as the result of two separate invitations to lecture at American universities, and perhaps these pieces sound excessively earnest when taken out of their original context. Yet in her attempts to address the subject of the "relations between fiction and history," many of her recommendations to fellow scholars sound dated or even simply fall flat. Pronouncements such as "I think those of us who write about modern writing have a duty to keep the discussion open and fluent and very broad-based" amount to a general exhortation to "create new paradigms" (which is one aspect of what she abhors in modern theoretical approaches). Part of her critical method is to quote long passages of fiction which she particularly admires, and part of it is to chastise those allegedly historical novelists who argue that the past is free for rapacious plunder. As she typifies their ideological stance: "If we can't know, we may invent, and anything goes." Most scholars would not even argue with many of her statements, and those novelists whom she takes roundly to task are probably not inclined to read her correctives. Byatt's main means of attack is through fiction itself, by archly satirizing its excesses, and by showing how criticism ought to be undertaken, through her own example of what she terms "ventriloquism." Creating on behalf of her own literary characters, Byatt recreates supposed Victorian or twentieth-century literary texts (as in Possession, Babel Tower, and The Biographer's Tale), thus creating the tale within a tale form which she so admires in her own favorite text, The Thousand and One Nights. (Although she makes an admirable attempt to pen historical documents, it is an almost impossible skill to master convincingly, thus rendering it a doubtful success.) Her ideal is the Victorian polymath; her passion is for "the surprise, the shining solidity of a world full of facts." The Biographer's Tale in particular tends to proffer these instead of old-fashioned virtues such as interesting characters or a riveting plot. While arguing against critical theory, Byatt has allowed the life of her own text to seep away unnoticed, while she writes exhaustively of subjects such as bee taxonomy. This trend towards convoluted arguments provides all the more reason to reread her earlier novels, The Game (1967), The Virgin in the Garden (1978) and Still Life (1985). These remain extraordinary evocations of the times in which they were set and during which they were composed?before (it mustbe admitted) the onslaught of critical theory made Byatt eager to assume a polemical stance, which does not suit her. Life still throbs in these books, whose passion is for England, for voracious reading, for intellectual ideals, and for zealous sexuality?rather than for facts, which pale in comparison. Janice Rossen, University of Texas at Austin ITALO CALVINO A Books Markey, Constance. ITALO CALVINO: A JOURNEY TOWARD POSTMODERNISM. University Press of Florida, 1999. xxi + 168 pp. $49.95. As clearly stated in the Editor's Fore word and reconfirmed in the author's introduction, this "exemplary addition to the Crosscurrent series . . . is designed to foreground comparative studies in European art and thought, particularly the intersections of literature and philosophy, aesthetics and culture." Thus, as Markey implies by her chapter headings ("The Author and his Works"; "First Steps in Neorealism"; "Modernist Travels"; "Fantasy Adventures"; "Otherworld Explorations"; "Final Journeys") and affirms from beginning to end of her succinct book, Calvino's life work is surveyed in its "evolution . . . from the author's</page><page sequence="52">592 Journal of Modern Literature beginning in neorealism, or anti-Fascist fiction, to his later development as a postmodem author," so as to present it chronologically and in a linear fashion to novice readers, students, teachers and "a general audience," all of whom experience Calvino in English. Nevertheless, in this autobiographical literary approach, Markey also presumes to place into context Calvino's "international background . . . both within Europe and beyond Europe," and, therefore, can be expected to do so by means of a complexity akin to that with which she admirably analyzes in Calvino's rich range of styles (from the ironic/neo-realist through the Modernist to the Postmodem and magical/realist). I have, then, some serious misgivings in re the professor's treatment of the historical and political context ofthe 1940s and 1950s in which Calvino shaped his literary sensibilities and techniques; her simplistic notions of neo-realism ("the arid land of everyday realism," the Partisans' and their fellow-travelers' "false fairy tales of Resistance literature") and her misuse of such words as "sarcastic," "spiteful," and "vindictive" to characterize Calvino's complex ironies. Markey never mentions how much the Italian Left did to fight for social justice and a rich culture for the previously downtrodden and dispossessed (ninety percent of the population), that the "literary convention vs. Resistance propaganda" debate raged in such major cultural journais as // Politecnico, in which such great Leftist artists as Vittorini, Pavese, Calvino, and Fenoglio eschewed propaganda in the name of non-ideological Sartrean engagement (see What Is Literature?), and that Calvino's metafiction (which she analyzes perceptively) emerges in Holocaust and Cold War contexts in which the United States had as much to do with inspiring Adorno's notion that one could not write poetry after Auschwitz and Hiroshima as did the Nazis and the Stalinists. Sharper focus in these areas would have helped us understand why Markey eulogizes Calvino's ultimate escapism (perhaps cynical, but not sarcastic) through Literature as "the citadel of man's independence, humanity's claim to eternity, and hence its ultimate blessing."

THEODORE DREISER AND AMERICAN CULTURE: NEW READINGS. University of Delaware Press, 2000. 321 pp. illus. $49.50. Hakutani's collection of essays on Dreiser is unusual because it collects such a wide range of approaches to the writer under one cover. As such, it is a useful tool for examining a variety of readings, not just of Dreiser's work, but to see the various ways in which different theoretical and critical approaches can widen our understanding of two movements that many may consider done to death. By re-examining American Realism and Naturalism through a mix of critical voices, Hakutani is offering a fresh approach to a canonical writer of the period, and also opening up wider discussion on the role of culture in literary formation. The work of some of our foremost Dreiser critics is offered here?Philip Gerber, Robert Butler, Thomas P. Riggio, James L. West III, and Hakutani himself are all present?but Hakutani also includes some fresh new voices, such as those of Marsha Moyer and Shawn St. Jean. The combination of approaches makes the collection an intriguing kaleidoscope of established and emerging talents looking at Dreiser and culture through psychoanalytic, feminist, new historicist, cultural and comparative perspectives. As Hakutani points out in his introduction, one of the major objectives of the collection is to place Dreiser back at the center of twentieth-century writing, showing that he was influenced by those who came before him and that his interpretation and development of the literary form were taken on by those who came after him. Dreiser has too often been characterized as dry and uninventive, but this collection?meant as a companion to the excellent restorative work being performed in the Pennsylvania Dreiser Edition?highlights the multi-faceted nature of Dreiser's innovation, work, and influence. Hakutani sets out to show that the narrow definition of the naturalist ethos that has cramped Dreiser criticism should be a relic of the past. By drawing on critics from a range of fields, the collection demonstrates that Dreiser comes to new life when set in a comparative and cultural context. Perhaps inevitably, the work addressed most in this collection is Sister Carrie, and this carries both a boon and a limitation. It is most useful to see different critical approaches applied to the best known of Dreiser's texts, but it is clear too that this work will most easily carry the critical and cultural approaches laid on it. While some of the essays included here do focus on other, less well-known works (such as An Amateur Laborer, A Traveler at Forty, and Jennie Gerhardt), it is Sister Carrie that bears the bulk of the load when the studies are largely contextual. It would have been interesting to read the inclusion of essays that addressed some of Dreiser's less lauded work in order to see if the interpretations of his cultural stance and awareness held true there as well. Of course, I acknowledge that there had to be limitations to the number of essays that could be included here, but the close readings might usefully have walked less familiar paths. On the other hand, the essays that make connections between Dreiser and other authors and cultural figures are extremely interesting and refreshing. Riggio's essay on "Dreiser, Fitzgerald and the Question of Influence" is important material for those interested in both men. I found Robert Butler's comparative study oiStuds Lonigan, Sister Carrie, and Native Son to be enlightening and challenging. In the best critical tradition, Butler finds new lines and connections in familiar texts, and makes them look different and new to us. The windows that Butler uses to link the three texts are opened to us through his lucid exploration of the image. On the whole, then, this collection is fresh and useful. Academicians will find interesting approaches to canonical texts and figures that incorporate some of the latest thinking in cultural studies, and students will find the essays useful as demonstrations of what can be achieved from taking different approaches to a major literary figure. Cross-cultural approaches are also valued here, as are the comparative looks that demonstrate Dreiser's</page><page sequence="58">598 Journal of Modern Literature influence both inside and beyond the fields of Realism and Naturalism. In many ways, the major achievement of this book is to revive a sense of Dreiser in a larger context than he has been allowed of late. It is a form of revitalization through a variety of critical approaches that could be happily extended to other writers of the period, writers who fell out of canonical favor as Modernism overtook them. This collection indicates a way forward that values the variety of critical discourse over a single ideology, a buffet rather than a fixed meal.

She extends the dialogic principle of Mikhail Bakbtin by developing the narratological method of Ross Chambers known as oppositional reading. In this technique, narrative is seen as an opposition</page><page sequence="67">Individual Authors 607 between a particular narrator's point of view and alternative views that arise from the changing, questioning nature of the text. The reading process thus delineated seeks out the alternative interpretations entailed, while denied, by any particular stance. Such a reading serves to promote awareness of the other, the excluded aspect of ourselves and of those we take for granted. Vesala-Varttala presents a series of subtle readings that help us to see in what ways the larger narrative structures of Joyce's works include those (often women) who seem to be silenced by conventional reading. One problem is that at times?as when she extends sympathy to the old man in "An Encounter"?her method gives the feeling that all potential voices in Joyce are equal; yet this feeling has much validity. This enterprising book does an effective job of enriching our understanding of Joyce's writing in a morally valuable direction. And it concludes with a salutary injunction for Joyce critics to take a more dialogic attitude toward each other. This study also expands Joycean horizons in another way, for Tampere, which is north of Helsinki, may be the northernmost city ever to produce an outstanding book on Joyce.

LARKIN'S BLUES: JAZZ POPULAR MUSIC AND POETRY. Louisiana State University Press, 1999. ix + 215 pp. $45.00. While Philip Larkin has often been perceived as a poet who celebrates traditional English verse, there has always been a grudging undercurrent of acknowledgement (by his critics, increasingly hostile in many respects) that he loved jazz. This taste for an anti-elitist, unacademic art form runs contrary to his poetic formalism and his continual disparaging of twentieth-century Modernism. Or does it? Leggett has put all of the pieces of the puzzle together with dazzling clarity, to illustrate how Larkin hoped to recast an aesthetic which would use modes of jazz and blues to revolutionize contemporary poetry (an ambition which has largely been credited to Modernists alone). Furthermore, jazz is actually elitist in its own peculiar way?for those who simply do not get it (c 'est moi), it is highly exciting to have elucidation at last on why Larkin loved jazz, in what ways he incorporated its conventions into his own poetic subtext, and why we continually sense a bedrock layer of popular lyrics in his work. Leggett's study not only takes Larkin seriously as an artist who used supposedly philistine artistic forms for complex purposes, but respects his critical pronouncements on writing and music (while exposing their hidden contradictions). In bringing a true understanding of jazz to the field, the book fllls in an enormous gap in our collective understanding of Larkin's work and elucidates the irony of "deceptive simplicity" in his poetry which the rest of his critics have walked around in ever-widening rings. This book goes straight to the center. Janice Rossen, University of Texas at Austin Booth, James. NEW LARKINS FOR OLD: CRITICAL ESSAYS.

Boulton, has for some years now been the model of the possibilities of modern textual scholarship. Lawrence, virtually all of whose texts were corrupted in one way or another during his lifetime, demands the most meticulous editorial and scholarly care, and of all of his works, none is more demanding than this last of his major novels. The two texts provided here are as close as we are likely to get to the author's intentions, and the textual apparatus, explanatory notes, and historical context provided by the editors make it possible to read these texts as wisely and as well as he might have wished. It is not only lovers of Lawrence who are indebted to Cambridge for this admirable effort. MPL Stewart, Jack. VITAL ART OF D.H. LAWRENCE: VISION AND EXPRESSION.

NO MENTOR BUT MYSELF: JACK LONDON ON WRITING AND WRITERS. Second Edition. Stanford University Press, 2000. $49.50 cloth, $17.95 paper. This second edition of Dale Walker's useful collection of Jack London's letters and articles about writing is a welcome addition to the field of London scholarship. Not only has the number of selections in this volume been almost doubled from that ofthe first edition, but the extensive headnotes, bibliography, and suggestions for further reading add to the value ofthe book for both seasoned London scholars and those coming to him for the first time. This volume is useful not only for those interested in London and his place in the literary world of the early twentieth century (particularly the part he played in extending the reach of Naturalism), but also as a teaching tool for creative writers. The focus here is on the nuts and bolts of writing, emphasizing technique, ideological approach, and the struggle of creativity</page><page sequence="72">612 Journal of Modern Literature in a practical and commercial world. The approach to London's works on writing collected here divides the letters and articles into three main themes: the writing business, the work ethic, and the role of mentorship in the development ofa writer. As Jeanne Campbell Reesman points out in her introduction, London is often full of contradictions and paradoxes in his approach to writing, and the new selections added in this edition highlight some of these. The most obvious is the pull of art over commercialism, despite London's vocal protestations. London, like many writers before and after him, is aware of economic need?he emphasizes that he writes, and has to write, to make a living?yet he is also apt to wax poetical about the wonder of aesthetic creation and the "mysteries and pleasures" of art for its own sake. His sense of writing as an act of work (often described as heavily physical work) for the sake of a pay check is often at odds with his sense of the purpose and value of what he was producing in aesthetic terms. Whatever his approach to writing, London is seen as consistent in his sincerity to produce the best crafted writing that he can and to make sure that it appeared in a correct, clean, and well-edited format. The volume contains detailed and angry letters to editors complaining about editorial misconduct. He was also very vocal about adaptations of his stories for the screen, chastising screen writers for trying to improve on his original plotline, or for changing an ending to make it more suitable for a cinematic audience. The overriding impression of London that we get from this collection is that of a craftsman who, while he claimed otherwise on many occasions, loved the process of writing. Maybe he did, as Reesman suggests, protest a little too much about the work involved. London wrote at least a thousand words every day, and the final versions of stories and novels show few alterations of the original typescripts, suggesting that the knotty work of revision was carried out on multiple handwritten drafts. For inspiration, London would look to other sources for ideas. An avid reader aware of world traditions of literature, he would draw on classical sources, recasting stories in contemporary settings familiar to him. If these sources generated no ideas, he would buy plot lines from other writers. For example, in 1910 he paid Sinclair Lewis $52.50 for nine ideas. In short, he was compelled to write, even if his own imagination did not always provide him with sufficient material. His work ethic was solid and unshakable throughout his career. London was aware of the public taste and of what sold well, and he gave the public what it wanted, while at the same time being true to his own ethics of fiction and subject matter. The success of works such as White Fang and The Call ofthe Wild in the international market (London was one of the best-selling American authors worldwide in the twentieth century) is a sure sign that his writing carried appeal for all sectors of the market. Children introduced to the works as adventure stories were matched by the more intellectual readers who understood the subtext of London's political and philosophical concerns. Despite claiming that he had "no mentor but myself," London was willing to offer advice to young writers, and much of what he had to say is illuminating when reflected back onto his own work. He encouraged writers to write less, but to write better. He shared with them the experience of hitting a "dead wall" and not being able to write constructively. His advice was blunt and honest; London did not believe in false praise and he was not worried about hurting someone's feelings. If a writer wanted to be good, then the way forward was to work hard. He advised one young man to "Buck up! Kick in! Get onto yourself. Don't squeal! .. . Make your stuff better." No one else will do it for him, London warns. Only hard work and perseverance will help him to succeed in his ambition. On the other hand, London was willing to share his idea that writing served a crucial role in society and in the shaping of the future, that it was a lofty calling. It was this sense of value that made London respond to other writers seeking his help, while he himself was working as fast as his health, habits, and environment would allow him.</page><page sequence="73">Individual Authors 613 The only fiction included in this anthology is, fittingly, made up of extracts from London's Martin Eden, a heavily autobiographical work. London admitted that he based Eden on himself and the struggles he had to go through as a writer to make a living while staying true to the art and craft of writing. In Martin's reaction to being popularly acclaimed, we can see London's own feelings. The bourgeoisie that "poured gold into his money sack" is the same audience that could not "appreciate or comprehend what he had written." Eden sees himself as "the fad of the hour, the adventurer who had stormed Pamassus while the gods nodded." Martin's fatigue, however, reflected in the claim that "he was glad the last manuscript was sold and that he would soon be done with all of it," seems to have rarely afflicted London himself. It is instructive to see the ideological paradoxes and contradictions of London's writing career play themselves out through the letters, articles, and novel extracts in this anthology. Perhaps more than anything, it is useful to have a record of a writer who saw his art as blue-collar work, something with which to wrestle and sweat. Some writers may like to present themselves as airy aesthetes touched by a divine inspiration, but Jack London?Socialist, worker, artisan?knew the true relationship between inspiration and perspiration, and this record of his struggles is valuable to readers and fellow writers alike.

KATHERINE MANSFIELD A BOOKS New, W.H. READING MANSFIELD AND METAPHORS OF FORM. McGill-Queen's University Press, 1999. xxi + 215 pp. $60.00. Free himself of the constraints of critical or theoretical dogma, New is able to free Mansfield's art from those which have adhered to it over the years. Instead of Mansfield as colonial, then, or as proto-feminist, or as disciple?or imitator?of Chekhov, he gives us a writer who taught herself to master her art from the smallest details. "Mansfield's talent lay in her stylistic control," New writes, "in the way she experimented with time, point of view, language choice, and durations of silence, to reveal, in the lives of her characters, the remarkable resonances of insight and regret, and to represent the moments of desire and debilitating pain that give life, as she understood it, meaning." New's method is the straightforward one of reading the stories closely?more closely perhaps than anyone else has done?and to look, where they are relevant, at manuscript revisions. From these, he fashions a series of formal strategies by Mansfield that serve as more than just form, that together operate as central metaphor in her work: "Form in these instances functions less as a language about than as an enactment of a state of affairs, a sensibility, a way of perceiving the world." The cumulative effect of his readings, like that ofthe stories themselves, convinces us ofthe critical truth of this vision. His prose style, too, building on nuance and rhythm but never sacrificing clarity, works to this end. Vision and style, this is quite an act of homage to the stylist Mansfield and the worldview effected within her art. Reading Mansfield is sure to bring about a new, much higher estimation of its subject's place within Modernism. Chapter 3, "In the Act of Writing: Manuscript Practice," appeared in JML, XX, 1.

In a profession not always noted for its generosity, no task is more often unrewarded than editing a collection of critical essays. Many literature departments will not even consider it in making merit or tenure decisions. (Some, of course, have no greater respect for the editing of journals.) This is by way of introduction to one ofthe most useful collections that I have encountered and, thus, one of the best jobs of editing. Everything is here that one could want as an introduction to reading or teaching Pound: a thorough apparatus and a solid introduction by the editor; essays on Pound and Modernism (by George Bornstein); his early poetry (Hugh Witemeyer); the Cantos from early to late (Daniel Albright, Ian F.A. Bell, and Ronald Bush), their texts (Richard Taylor), and their influence (Peter Nicholls); on Pound as critic (Massimo Bacigalupo) and translator (Ming Xie); Pound and the visual arts (Reed Way Dasenbrock) and music (Michael Ingham), his politics and economics (Tim Redman), his relations with women and their place in his poetry (Helen M. Dennis), on his anti-Semitism (Wendy Flory). The essays as a group manage very well to be both expert and accessible, and for this too the editor deserves some credit. MPL Surette, Leon.

The translation of Bronfen's book on Dorothy Richardson, originally published fourteen years ago in German, enters into the panorama of scholarship on Pilgrimage as an outstanding contribution that will remain highly influential for future scholars. Bronfen points out the fact that "precisely because Pilgrimage has been recuperated from oblivion primarily as a voice of feminine modernism, the philosophical underpinnings to Richardson's work are sometimes overlooked." Calling attention to the philosophical issues present in Pilgrimage is precisely the task of Bronfen's book, whose subtitle, Space, Identity, Text, highlights the importance of "how identity emerges as a result of both corporeal as well as cultural enspacement." The author finds a principle of unity for Pilgrimage in the semantic rendering of textual space, and the study of these aspects was in 1986, as it is in the year 2000, a rescue from a critical preoccupation focused mainly on biographical and feminist studies. By calling attention to an analysis of space, Bronfen demonstrates that Pilgrimage contains both intellectual and formal coherence. Bronfen's book requires a careful and slow-paced reading, so that the various theoretical approaches on which the author draws can be satisfactorily understood in relation</page><page sequence="81">Individual Authors 621 to the copious textual evidence provided. On the whole, the exhaustive thoroughness of this study?somewhat marred by numerous misprints in the translation?turns it into a monograph of invaluable significance for the study of the textual space of Pilgrimage. Its translation into English will now make its circulation much wider than that enjoyed by the original German version.

RAINER MARIA RILKE A BOOKS Gass, William H. READING RILKE: REFLECTIONS ON THE PROBLEM OF TRANSLATION. Knopf, 1999. 234 pp. 256 pp. $25.00 cloth, $15.00 paper. In a catalogue written for the Film Library at Washington University, Gass offers notes on his favorite texts (limited to fifty). He mentions at least four by Rilke. Thus, this book is the result of a lifelong love. Gass always surprises the reader. This book is, in parts, a short biography of Rilke; a reading of various English translations; an exploration of creativity, translation, and reader response; and a new translation by Gass of the Duino Elegies. The mosaic creates a new genre. Although it is not a radical innovation such as the essay-novella entitled Willie Master's Lonesome Wife, it again demonstrates his unmistakable blurring of genres. This beautiful book must be read slowly. Every sentence offers aesthetic bliss. (Surely no critic I know can equal Gass?except perhaps Henry James in his prefaces to the New York Edition.) Here is a particularly moving, poetic passage from the last chapter entitled "Erect No Immortal Stone": "the poem becomes a condition ofthe body; it enlivens our bones, and they dance-They dance the Hardy, the Hopkins, the Valery, the Yeats; because the poem is the state of the soul, too (the soul we once had) and these states change as all else does and grow weak or strong as all else does, and even if these verbalized moments of consciousness suggest things which are unjust or untrue when mistaken for statement, when rightly written they are real; they themselves are as absolutely as we achieve the Real in this unrealized life. . . ."

EPIC OF THE DISPOSSESSED: DEREK WALCOTT'S OMEROS. University of Missouri Press, 1997. x + 187 pp. $39.95 cloth, $19.95 paper. The days of the single-author, not to mention single-text, monograph are supposed to have passed with the death of the author, announced, now, so long ago. Hamner resurrects the genre in this study of Derek Walcott's Omeros, a Caribbean epic of the complexity, allusiveness, and breadth deserving of the sustained reflection which this genre permits. Walcott's Omeros is also appropriate to the single-author study in that it is a text in which authorial presence is constantly, perhaps even obsessively, reasserted. Hamner begins with two introductory chapters that present the broad themes of his study?Walcott's manipulation of traditional poetic form, the relation of Walcott's poem to the tradition of epic narrative, and its St. Lucian or Caribbean particularity. Each subsequent chapter provides the exegesis to the first through the seventh and fmal books of Omeros. Walcott's poem is rife with intertexts?personal, historical, and literary?and Hamner presents convincing readings of those references, weaving them effectively into the larger narrative frame work of Omeros. The poem is also characterized by a disrupted chronology and multiple shifts in narrative perspective, and Hamner provides a compelling interpretation of "the intermingling of past, present, and future combined with the superimpostion of authorial presence." Hamner's study is nonetheless plagued by a curious form of argumentation. At times, he establishes premises which are evidently false and then proceeds to disprove them. In the introduction, Hamner writes, "[h]aving as his point of departure the neglected colony of a fading empire, a people descended from slaves and provincial clerks, his subject matter might at first appear unpromising," as if Aime Cesaire, Alejo Carpentier, or other Caribbean writers had not previously dealt with the same subject matter to great acclaim. Within a few paragraphs, he has, of course, shown the interest in just this class of people. Later, Hamner suggests, in accord with other critics, that the middle sections of Omeros?those that take place in the United States and in Europe (Books 3-5)?distract from the St. Lucian epic at the core of the work, but then smartly argues a few pages further on that Walcott's "assimilative consciousness" effectively blends these disparate elements into the sections dealing directly with St. Lucia (Books 1-2 and 6-7). These probiems aside, Hamner's study constitutes a thorough and insightful reading of this fundamental Caribbean epic. The whole may have benefitted, though, from a less rigid structure. Hamner approvingly cites Walcott's displeasure with linear readings of Omeros, yet this is precisely how his own work on Omeros is structured. A more supple critical</page><page sequence="87">Individual Authors 627 structure?one that, for instance, organizes the study thematically?would have been more appropriate to a work as dense, disjointed, and polyphonic as Omeros.

UNDERSTANDING EUDORA WELTY. University of South Carolina Press, 1999. ix + 262 pp. $29.95. Kreyling is an ideal critic for an understanding of Welty. He is the author of two earlier books on her work and the co-editor of her complete writings for the Library of America series. He is also the author of Inventing Southern Literature, an iconoclastic, deconstructive study ofthe field of Southern literature. Welty has always been a problem for critics. She is usually viewed as a natural storyteller, a Southern Gothic writer, or a short story writer who never produced a successful novel. Losing Battles is still painful reading for many readers. It is ironic that Porter's introduction to A Curtain of Green propounded the natural and Gothic labels?she did not see the complexity of these early stories; she was not a close reader. Kreyling's analysis of "The Petrified Man" (a story in this collection) is convincing. He demonstrates the links in the story: the ladies who seem to dislike their husbands, the mythological subtext, the meaning of Billy Boy's comic comment in the last line. Kreyling's reading of The Robber Bridegroom is brilliant. He explores why this text, for the most part, lurks in the shadows of Welty criticism: "The Robber Bridegroom is not always at the forefront in critical discussions of Welty's works. Its genre is a problem: Novel? Novella? Short story? Tale? By what standard of form and performance is the work to be judged?" After tracing the fairy-tale elements, literary borrowings, he prepares us to accept his conclusions. The Robber Bridegroom is a successful work with "the relatively thick overlay of borrowing and allusion." Perhaps the best chapter in this book is the final one. Kreyling reads The Optimist's Daughter and One Writer's Beginnings intertextually. Both seem to be less secretive than her other works; the dynamics of family relationships are clearly demonstrated. The mother- daughter relationship seems to be at the heart of all her texts. Here is the clear closing of Kreyling's necessary book. "Extending and confirming patterns ventured in earlier works, The Optimist's Daughter and One Writer's Beginnings set the family as the crucial dramatic situation and the mother-daughter relation as the power source for the author's plots, themes, and patterns of imagery and symbol."

EDITH WHARTON Tintner, Adeline R. EDITH WHARTON IN CONTEXT: ESSAYS ON INTERTEXTUALITY. University of Alabama Press, 1999. 304 pp. $39.95. Although I do not admire Wharton's books very much, I do appreciate Tintner's criticism. She is, of course, our leading Jamesian because of her training in art history; her thorough, daring detective work; her immersion in the library of James. (She compiled a comprehensive</page><page sequence="89">Individual Authors 629 inventory of James's library, which she co-edited with Leon Edel, and read all the books that he owned.) Thus, it is impossible not to note the ways in which Wharton and James glossed each other*s fiction. This give-and-take inspires seven chapters. In her introduction, she writes that "the five tales included in the collection, The Finer Grain, contain Edith icons that clearly have a humorous reference to her vital yet domineering personality." And she claims that Wharton herself seems to have "plundered James's tale, 'Julia Bride' (1909) for a chapter in 'The Custom ofthe Country....'" In the chapter, "Metamorphoses of Wharton," I am fascinated by Tintner's comment that "the 'grain woman,' the woman who goes against the grain ofthe central and lively consciousness becomes the key figure in the ensuing predicament." Wharton seems to lurk behind James's Mora in "Mora Montrarero." Tintner pounces on the details to prove her case. And it is difficult to disagree with her adventurous reading or with the connections that she makes between "Julia Bride" and the Wharton borrowings. Tintner recognizes that the Wharton background has inspired several contemporary writers to include references to her. She is convincing in her reading of Richard Howard's poem, "The Lesson ofthe Master," detailing Howard's knowledge of Wharton's "obsession to be neat and control her environment. ..." She traces the Wharton figure in the novel by Carol Hills entitled Henry James' Midnight Song and in Cathleen Shine's The Love Letter. I am dazzled by her ability to discover Wharton in contemporary novels known to few specialists in the field. Perhaps the most exciting chapter in the study is her discovery of a poem written by Wharton in a copy of Romain Rolland's Vie de Tolstoi (1911) from James's library. This handwritten poem of five lines found on the back cover is intriguing not only for its content but for the fact that neither James nor Walter Berry noticed Wharton's handwriting. Tintner writes, "How did the book get from Fullerton to Barry? And why did Barry then give this book, having an intimate private message (apparently not to him but to Morton Fullerton) to their mutual friend, Henry James?" Tintner tries to solve the puzzle; she reads the Rolland book; she chases clues to Fullerton's whereabouts, to James's apparent failure to read the entire text. The twists and turns of Tintner's adventure show her curiosity, knowledge, and devotion. The appendix is breathtaking; yet it is a mere example of Tintner at her best. This book reminds us of the joy of reading, of literary discovery, of keen scholarship. IM Killoran, Helen. EDITH WHARTON: ART AND ALLUSION. University of Alabama Press, 1999. 223 pp. $19.95 paper.

Syracuse University Press, 1999. xvi + 208 pp. $34.95. Critics and scholars ofthe Modernist novel have worked diligently in recent years to disprove</page><page sequence="91">Individual Authors 631 the long-accepted canard that these novelists were at worst reactionaries, at best disinterested in politics. Readings of Joyce have benefitted considerably from this re-view; it is now Woolfs turn. Using Woolfs diaries?especially the war diaries?and her extensive revisions of her novels, Levenback makes a forceful and convincing case for a novelist closely attuned to the changing sensibilities of a nation at war, after the war, and anticipating the next war. Thus, Jacob 's Room and Mrs. Dalloway are read explicitly as war novels, with characters and events understood in a new way: Clarissa's party "reaffirms the chasm between civilians and combatants"; Septimus' suicide is due not to shell-shock "but to the shock occasioned by recognition of the power of the postwar world to ignore or to suppress"; their bond is "spiritual" because that "is the only kind she is capable of feeling." To the Lighthouse, in the same vein, is a postwar novel, with "The Window" presented "as an attempt by Woolf to embody the pervasive sense of sentimentality and myth that invited participation in and support for the Great War, but disallowed its reality. The setting of the novel can be seen as providing us not so much with Woolfs memory of her family, as with the ways in which the language ofthe time reflected a prewar mythology." Similarly, "Time Passes" is presented as more than a mere metaphoric depiction of World War I, and in "The Lighthouse" "the surviving characters ... remain... linked through what they remember ofthe prewar past." Levenback's scheme concludes with The Years and its "portents ofthe second war." Again, the novelist's awareness of and sensitivity to historical events are manifested in her technical skill: "Woolf, with brilliant narrative ingenuity, suggests the importance of the war in memory, partly through the ambiguous dating ofthe last, longest, and most discussed section, 'Present Day," and the explicit dating ofthe shortest chapter, which precedes it, '1918.'" More subtly still, "Woolf suggested the blurring ofthe war and the peace ... by moving from 11 November 1918 to May 1921 without a section break." "What I have tried to show," Levenback sums up, "is that her work, and particularly the novels that have the most direct relation to the Great War, reveal a persistence of memory; a consciousness of life and death; and an understanding of the public mood, in the war, after the war, and under threat of war. At the same time, these works, and particularly those written in the prospect of World War II, suggest an inability for individuals (even those around her) to resist the herd instinct, a reality that finally not even she can resist." Woolf may well have been unattuned to party politics, as Leonard Woolf so famously suggested, but we can no longer conclude from this that she was unconcerned about or insensitive to politics in the larger sense of that term. Virginia Woolf and the Great War is a fine and important contribution to our understanding of one of the best of the Modernist Masters. MPL Rudikoff, Sonya.
