<plain_text><page sequence="1">Bailing Out the Ark: Norman Myers Discusses Saving Threatened Species Nearly one-half of the world's species are threatened with extinction in the next fifty years. Not only charismatic, highly publicized animals like tigers, whales, and condors, but obscure and nameless creatures with unknown potential will disappear. To say that the world will be a poorer place after these species are gone is a drastic understatement; mankind will lose not only their genetic diversity, but also their potential usefulness as food, fuel, or medicine. Conservationist and researcher Nor- man Myers has spent much of his profes- sional life studying the problem of in- creasing rates of species extinction. In his role as a senior associate of the World Wildlife Fund, as well as with oth- er organizations, Myers has worked in more than 70 countries. He has lived in the tropics for 22 years-currently in Nairobi, Kenya-and has conducted re- search in the tropical moist forests, which contain a large percentage of the world's species. He has written a book on species extinction, The Sinking Ark, plus numerous journal and magazine ar- ticles, as well as a recently published re- port on the conversion of the tropical forests, written for the National Acad- emy of Sciences. Myers received his doctorate degree from the University of California, Berkeley, in 1973. During a recent visit to Washington, Myers discussed the problem of van- ishing species, various strategies for slowing down the alarming rates of ex- tinction, and some of the political con- siderations that have grown out of an es- sentially biological phenomenon. Let's start by contructing a "worst * case" scenario. What would hap- pen if no one tried to halt the rates of spe- cies extinction? A If you project population growth * rates in the tropics, which is where two-thirds of all species live, and if you project material consumerism growth rates in the developed world, then it's hard to see how many natural environ- ments will remain undisturbed or escape gross disruption within the foreseeable future of, say, the next five decades. If the tropics were to become one big maize patch or rice patch, which is not at all unlikely in the humid tropics, then in the next 50 years it's probable that we'd lose one-third of all species, and it is by no means inconceivable that we'd lose one-half. That's a quantitative scenario. In qualitative terms, we might find that the surviving species contain a dis- proportionate percentage of opportunist, or so-called "clever," species, which tend to become pests. There would be a disproportionate number of creatures like rats, cockroaches, and sparrows, which are not going to go extinct. gQ 8Do these survivor species tend to be * less useful to humans? A Those species that we currently * call pests could be put to good use. Of course, to that extent, we'd be in clo- ver. Someone was saying the other day that if we could persuade people in Asia that house rats are aphrodisiacs (instead of having them turn to rhinos for rhino horns), or if we could devise some phal- lic symbol from cockroaches or persuade them to make canneloni out of cock- roaches, then we'd solve several prob- lems at once. To call a species a pest is strictly an anthropomorphic term. We ought to be able to catch sparrows and make pies of them; then we'd use a num- ber of these species. There are very few species that multiply readily that have been put to good utilitarian use. XQ \Suppose there were a very con- a certed effort to halt species ex- tinction; to what extent could we slow down the rates? A I've often wondered that. Sup- * pose the Congress, the White House, and the United Nations were to mount some kind of a Manhattan Project V i F~~~~~~....... ... August 1980 553 Features and News</page><page sequence="2">or Marshall Plan to save species. Sup- pose all these nations really got geared up and said, "What can we do from next Monday morning if we do a special job?" I still suspect that we could lose many thousands-probably hundreds of thou- sands-of species because the processes of habitat disruption are so strongly un- derway. You see, we'd have to turn around a lot of marketplace forces that are contributing to habitat disruption. It's a bit like the problem of an oil- tanker at sea: The captain receives the order to turn around and go back the way he came, but it takes him two hours to slow his vessel and another two hours to turn the corner. So even if we could gen- erate the political will for a comprehen- sive "save-species" campaign, I still think it would take 10 years for it to gen- erate sufficient momentum to counteract the economic forces, the marketplace forces, and the population pressures, that are coming in the other direction. gQ \You have mentioned a "triage" * system for dealing with threatened species, in which we would concentrate on trying to save those species that have the best chance for survival. This seems to run counter to the traditional approach to preserving species, which says no matter what it is, we should try to save it; we real- ly can't decide what should be blotted out and what shouldn't be. Do you think that we've reached the point where it's neces- sary to make decisions like that? A It's a dreadful dilemma to con- * front-to say that we have to choose between the species that we want to save and those that will be allowed to fall quietly over the edge of the boat. But we're already making those choices, al- though we don't like to admit it. When we allocate a stack of conservation funds and start the scientific skills to safeguard one batch of species over there, we're automatically denying those same re- sources to another batch of species over here. So whether we like to admit it or not, we're already making large-scale choices in favor of one species and saying in effect that other species are less deserving so they can sink beneath the waves. I suggest that if we are making these choices already, let's do it by design, rather than by default. Let's make our choosing as systematic and methodical as possible. The World Wildlife Fund and the IUCN [International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources] have been in business for 20 or 30 years. They've been trying to play Noah in that time. And because the pub- lic hasn't produced the funding needed, we've rather goofed at the Noah game, and now we're going to have to play god on a large scale, whether we want to or not. There are some people, whose opin- ions I deeply respect and who've been in this game a long time, who say that all species have an equal right to exist. That's an ethical argument, and you can't argue with that. I say: Okay, there's validity to that argument. But nevertheless, when you say that you'll allocate $2 million to the California con- dor, with only a 50-50 chance of success (I believe that's the projection), you're automatically denying those same funds to 100 obscure bugs in the middle of Amazonia which have a 95% chance of survival. So we should look at the way we spend money on the California con- dor rather carefully. I think that we're going to have to be more analytical than we have been in the past about how we allocate funds. If we become hardnosed in our arithme- tic, that doesn't mean we need to become any less warmhearted about certain spe- cies; we're just more methodical. Qn How do we go about making in- * telligent decisions about which spe- cies to save? What factors do we need to take into account? What are the charac- teristics of a survivor? A Well, there are several ways you * can skin that cat. One is to look at the ecological value of species-which ones contribute most to the workings of their ecosystems. Some species are criti- cal to the workings of their ecosystems; some don't do very much. To that ex- tent, the latter are more dispensable. In economic terms, some categories of species are more valuable than others. It seems that the oddball species present chemicals that are useful for agriculture, medicine, and industry. The jojoba is like that, and it is the only species in its particular genus. These oddball species produce the goodies, although it's not clear why. Another way to approach the whole "triage" question is to put our con- servation dollars into areas where there are high concentrations of endemic spe- cies. If we can identify these areas, we can get a far better return for our con- servation dollar than we can by going af- ter just one species that may have a pretty wide range. This is not to say that we should lock away those areas and then chop down the rest of the forest, because that would then affect the cli- mate within the little protected areas. It's a case of putting a lot of emphasis on small areas of very high priority and doing a good job with the other 80 or 90% What about when we are deciding Q about a mammal that has no real use that we are aware of but needs a large area to survive? Is it worth trying to pro- tect it in its natural habitat, or would it be better to keep it in a zoo or a preserve? A We don't know that a tiger is going * to produce any utilitarian benefits. It doesn't seem to offer much of a cure for cancer. But the tiger is a fine symbol for the conservation campaign; it can spring money loose from citizens' pock- ets. Moreover, when we protect the ti- ger's ecosystem, we are automatically protecting the ecosystem of thousands of associated species, some of them ob- scure bugs that haven't even been identi- fied by science. So let's go gung ho on the tiger campaign, even if the animal has no apparent use. The related point is: What do we do with species that have no apparent utili- tarian value, no logical value, and no symbolic value? Do we say these species are of no use to us? We have to cover the uncertainty angle even if they don't have any use right now; we don't know what use they might have in 20 years. So in cases like that, I think we should try to take out an insurance policy. Then we say, in order to safeguard these seem- ingly useless species and keep our op- tions open, what will it cost us? How big an insurance premium do we have to pay? And if it's not unacceptably large, let's invest the money even though we don't know if there's going to be any re- turn on the investment. As long as put- ting a safety net under these species is not too costly, then let's do it. There's a lot of uncertainty in other spheres of public life; defense costs bil- lions of dollars, and we don't know if there's going to be a worthwhile return. It really comes down to a seat-of-the-pants judgment and doing the best we can with an insurance-policy kind of approach. We're investing in health and education, and we can't measure their output accu- rately, and we aren't certain that we're going to achieve what we're looking for. The same kind of approach can be ap- plied to a save-species campaign. BioScience Vol. 30 No. 8 554</page><page sequence="3">But it's a less popular, less "use- * ful" cause than defense or health. A That leads us to another issue: Na- * tional security now needs to be de- fined in a way other than the number of Centurion tanks and intercontinental mis- siles we have. It's increasingly becoming a matter of how many natural resources or excess of natural resources we have. The United States economy is so depen- dent on outside sources of germplasm for agriculture, medicine, and industry that this is now beginning to amount to some kind of strategic interest to the country. [Then-Senator] Muskie used the ex- pression "national interest" as a way of looking at the conservation campaign. That's the first time it's been looked at in those terms. If saving species can be per- ceived in those terms, then maybe the United States government can see it as some kind of a priority need- maybe not ranking with defense, but nevertheless, it's not a thirdly thing that we do with the few dollars that are left when we've taken care of all the other things. Saving species should be sold in mar- ketplace terms, as a worthwhile invest- ment that gives a certain rate of return. That's the way to sell it to the public, too, in addition to the furry-things-and- feathered-beasts approach. gQ \ What about zoos? I think you men- * tion somewhere that when you breed animals in captivity, you tend to breed them for captivity, so that basically what you're saving isn't the wild species. Is there still a place for zoos and preserves in the save-species campaign? A There is, as long as we recognize * that it's strictly a second-rate, backup strategy. Nothing can remotely match safeguarding these things in the wild. But if we can't save them in the wild, then put them in a zoo. This leads to all kinds of inbreeding problems. A Smithsonian team documented this re- cently, and it is quite a sizable problem. But it now looks as if we can save a species by saving a bit of DNA; we don't have to keep a whole herd of Arabian oryx or whatever. We can just take a bit of tissue and freeze it, then dig the stuff out in 20 years or so and try to reconsti- tute it. Technology is almost at that point. But we are not safeguarding wild species that way; we are safeguard- ing what then become domesticated creatures. Wildlife Tax Would Help Habitats, Protect Primates, and Irk Investigators A new conservation bill that has some of the research community up in arms has been introduced by Rep. Mike Lowry (D-Wash.). The International Wild- life Conservation Act of 1980 (H.R. 7241) is designed to relieve the chronic funding famine in the field of conservation. The bill sets up a program to tax imported "wildlife products" for 7% of their commercial value. An appropria- tion-probably amounting to at least $5 million-equal to the revenue collected would be placed in an International Wildlife Fund, which would be adminis- tered by a seven-member Conservation Grant Panel. Foreign governments with the desire but not the cash to carry out con- servation projects would apply for the grants. The program would favor proj- ects that protect habitats and ecosystems, rather than focus on a single spe- cies, according to Lowry's staff. The panel would also select grantees on the basis of a documented commitment to conservation, the relationship between the proposed project and other projects, and the experience and abilities of the persons or organizations that would do the work. Scientists who object to the bill do so because research animals are not ex- empted from the tax, and investigators envision drastic increases in research costs. Since most animals imported for research have very little commercial value, this fear is largely unfounded. "Seven percent of zero is still zero," says biologist Lynn Corn, a congressional science fellow working with Lowry on the bill. Moreover, in any project, the total cost of research animals is almost always less than 5% of the grant, Corn says, so the tax would be a minimal 7% of 5%. Primates are the large and obvious exception to this; scientists are the major importers and users of the increasingly rare animals. The United States, al- though working to establish domestic colonies of primates, is still dependent on foreign sources. Like most scarce commodities, primates are expensive. They are becoming rarer partially because of habitat loss in the wild. "It was mainly out of concern for the primates that we didn't write in a flat exemption," Corn says. Zoo animals can also cost a lot, and are also subject to the tax, even though the zoo may not operate for profit. Like primates, many species found in zoos are threatened with habitat loss in the wild. "The animal is so expensive be- cause it is rare," Corn says. "It is not unreasonable to ask the user to contrib- ute to maintaining its habitat." The most expensive zoo animal, according to one zoo director, is the rhino, which costs about $100,000. The tax on the rhino would be $7000-a fairly modest sum compared to the original investment. The tax is not intended to kill trade, but to maintain it. "It's in the interest of all groups to keep populations alive and healthy," Corn says. "It's based on the same philosophy as other user taxes." Somewhat surprisingly, the bill has the support of the American fur industry as well as of other groups. H.R. 7241 also takes into account the precarious state of United States for- eign relations and the need to avoid appearing meddlesome. The program works cooperatively; the applicants themselves select their most urgent needs, and are not required to perform any specific action. Recipient nations will "match" the grant up to 10% with resources of their own, and the resources need not be money but could be personnel services or land. The lower limit for the matching resources is deliberately not specified, although, as Lowry's staff points out, it is difficult to imagine a nation with absolutely nothing to contribute. Lowry plans no hearings at this point. The bill was sent to 50-100 organiza- tions, and the comments coming back may allow revisions to proceed with- out hearings. Of the bill's chances for passage, Corn says, "There is little rea- son to hope that we'll get it through this year." But the need, she says, is crucial: "Whether it's this or another plan, something must be done." Is this being done extensively now, * or is it just getting started? August 1980 555</page><page sequence="4">A It's been done extensively with * plants for quite a long time. The San Diego Zoo is getting into saving ani- mals through preserving tissue, but they're still in the pioneering stages. I suspect that in two or three years, the technology will come onstream, and DNA research will enable us to do a pretty good job with this. But it is strictly a backup approach. It's no worthwhile substitute for safeguarding organisms in the wild, and safeguarding whole ecosystems. Q The majority of species are in de- * veloping countries that have little money for conservation, and development and conservation are often spoken of as being mutually exclusive. Do you think that's true? Are there many developing countries that are trying to work a con- servation plan into their development? A Conservation is now being slowly * recognized as a very legitimate form of development in itself, not just as a support for conventional development activities like agriculture and industry. At the time of the 1971 Stockholm con- ference, I don't think there was one de- veloping country with a conservation or environmental agency. Now there are more than 18 developing countries with some kind of conservation agency. They've come a long, long way. It's difficult to convince developing countries to save a forest just to save a species, but they're beginning to realize that when the forests on the hilltop dis- appear, that affects their green-revolu- tion agriculture because they aren't get- ting steady supplies of irrigation water. It affects their electricity supply, because the hydropower dam is filled up with silt, and it affects their public health pro- grams, because there is no longer good quality water. They're beginning to rec- ognize that conserving forests is a pretty good investment. Conservation is no longer the dirty word that it used to be. However, coming back to the earlier point, when we say to the developing countries, "Hey, you guys have nearly two-thirds to three-fourths of all species on earth, a big part of the global natural heritage. What a big responsibility you have!", they're inclined to reply that the countries that currently benefit most from the genetic resources are the coun- tries with the technology to exploit the genetic resources, and that means the developed nations. As a Brazilian once said to me, "If there are anti-cancer plants in the Amazon, the benefits won't accrue to Brazilians because, on the whole, a lot of Brazilians don't live long enough to contract cancer. The benefits will accrue to Americans and Europeans and Japanese." So insofar as Brazil tries to safeguard those resources, Brazil is in effect subsidizing the developed world as a kind of foreign aid in reverse. Some of the developing nations are be- ginning to see this matter of genetic re- sources and germplasm within the frame- work of the North-South dialogue and the new economic order. They're saying, "We have some very valuable resources here in terms of these species, these ob- scure plants and insects, that the fat-cat northern nations want for their industry and medicine. If the United States wants some of our germplasm, it can jolly well pay highly and heavily for it." There's a lot of merit to that argument, especially if the developing nations incur sub- stantial economic costs through setting aside areas as off-limits to development. If they can sell the resources of those parks-germplasm and so on-then why not? I am concerned that species, re- sources, and germplasm might become materials for the North-South con- frontation; they might be used as negoti- ating checks in the standoff between the North and South. That would be a trag- edy, I think, because a save-species campaign on the part of the global com- munity could be a way of rising above political differences. But in a few years, species could be used as negotiating chips in this standoff. Instead of having a cooperative venture working to save species, we might have the developing nations saying that, unless they get a bet- ter break in the North-South con- frontation, they might decide that they have better things to think about than safeguarding species. It would be dread- ful if species were used as a tool of black- mail by the developing nations, but I would not be surprised. I would be very sorry, but I would not be surprised, if in 10 years we were to see that happening, unless the developed nations were to play a bigger part in conservation cam- paigns in developing nations. Q The World Conservation Strategy * is designed to include both devel- oped and developing nations. Do you think that it will prove a useful tool in con- serving species? I think that it's an exceptionally * fine statement of where we want to go, down the road. I don't think it's near- ly so strong on how we get from here to there. It needs to be integrated in the findings of the Brandt Commission on North-South relations, and what is going to come out of your Global 2000 study when CEQ releases it. I don't think that the World Conservation Strategy is suffi- ciently political, although it was written with deliberate intent to avoid getting tangled up in politics. When a political leader gets this on his desk and says, "How can I apply this in my planning?", the strategy is not quite as helpful on the nuts and bolts as it might have been. That could be the next step. Getting the World Conservation Strategy so widely publicized was a major step. Maybe by next year we could see a meshing of the World Conservation Strategy and the Brandt Commission proposals. Then we'd really go a long way in conservation. We're dealing with interdependency relationships in the global village on a political and economic level. The Third Worlder tends to say: "How can a devel- oped-world conservationist talk about the International Union for the Con- servation of Nature without in the same breath talking about the new inter- national economic order?" I am not sure that American or European con- servationists would be too clear on what the new international economic order is all about. That's a case of perception. Q What do you think would be the * most important next step we could take now in the interest of conserving species? A There would be several steps. * First would be to recognize the na- ture and size of the beast we're trying to grapple with; that is, get the issue on po- litical agendas, show that this is a major challenge facing the global community with long-term repercussions for society into the indefinite future. Second, where- as most of the species are in the tropics, and most environmental degradation is taking place in the tropics, everybody is contributing to the situation indirectly and unwittingly, and everybody will lose if the species in the tropics continue to go under. Third, we should all contribute to a comprehensive conservation pro- gram, not as a further form of foreign aid given out of a spirit of charity, but out of a spirit of recognition of joint responsi- bility for this common heritage of species. -Susan Walton BioScience Vol. 30 No. 8 556</page></plain_text>
