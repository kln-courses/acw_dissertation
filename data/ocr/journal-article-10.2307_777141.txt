<plain_text><page sequence="1">De- and Re-constructing the Indian Temple By Michael W Meister In a contemporary world where "decon- struction" is an appropriate position for literary criticism and "de-constructivism" an appropriate architectural response to the human environment, I am reminded of one Indian philosopher's argument to prove the theorem that any number times zero equals zero: "If the sequence 1 x 1 = 1, 1 x /2 = /2, 1 x V4 = V4 . . , etc., holds, its logical termination must be 1 x 0 = 0." If a building has no meaning, is it worth taking apart? Of Louis Kahn's assembly hall in Dhaka, Bangladesh, we might argue that formalism is its meaning or of Frank Gehry's houses that their very de- structuring of order gives them form; orna- ment, scorned by modernism at times as "mere" decoration, has returned to archi- tecture in a "postmodern" world primarily as an expression of luxury and whimsy, if sometimes also in the name of "symbol- ism." How far we have moved from an understanding of how form and meaning can provide an identity, however, can be tested by looking at one of architectural history's most extreme examples, the stone temple in north India as it evolved from ca. A.D. 400 to 1500 (fig. 1). This essay draws on a series of studies I have made over the past fifteen years de- coding aspects of the north Indian temple and puts in "play" some of the theoretical constructs that have been useful to me. Historiography: Seriation of Indian mon- uments into schools and styles and chrono- logically into centuries (now only some- times into decades) began as a scholarly activity in the nineteenth century and con- tinues today.1 Going beyond chronology, however, Stella Kramrisch's study The Hindu Temple (1946) placed the monument back into a rich ritual and symbolic con- text, drawing on a body of surviving archi- tectural manuals meant in part to record mnemonically some aspects of actual prac- tice.2 Such "scientific" texts (sastras), however, were written as much to provide a ritual validation for the construction of temples-as part of a received body of sacred knowledge-as to give guidance to masons or carpenters.3 Only a few recent studies have placed temples into place-and-time-specific con- texts, exploring the sociology of their use.4 That such use changes over time, and that Figure 1 Kandariya Mahadeva temple, Khajuraho, Central India, ca. A.D. 1025-50 the use and redefinition of monuments (as of all symbolic forms) does require "de- construction," is a challenge for the pre- sent generation of scholars. The temple's functions as a soteriological tool still de- mand a variety of ethnographic as well as art-historical explications.5 Recent art-historical studies, however, have begun to explain the evolution of the architectural morphology of the temple in terms of its symbolic use.6 In its planning, elevation, and "decorative" veneer, the temple can be shown in specific ways to construct the reality it was meant to repre- sent. This iconic "sign" value for the mon- ument was essential to make its use by worshipers effective. In terms of Charles Sanders Peirce's semiotic categories, the temple could both be, and stand for, its meaning.7 Measurement: As one example, a square diagram (mandala) used ritually to found brick altars in ancient India also acted as underpinning for the plan of the stone tem- ple.8 This was true not simply for the sake of ritual foundation, but as an architectural mechanism used to plan and proportion the new monument (fig. 2). A study I made some years ago of temples in north India, using actual measurements, demonstrated that the proportions of this diagram were used to guard the sanctum for many centu- ries, although applied by architects in a variety of creative ways (fig.' 3).9 This diagram's grid, when used to build a sheltering structure, dictated the thick walls surrounding the interior chamber. It could also be used to project the dimension of the sanctum through the temple's walls by measuring the first layer of projecting masonry used as an offset on each side. The central four squares of this grid within the sanctum marked the "place for 'supreme reality' (brahman)," according to texts. This "sacred ground" (brahmasthana) then provided a measure for central but- tresses on the exterior walls; these sculp- turally were defined as "doors" or doorlike niches and used to shelter devotional im- ages of deities that functioned as aspects of the inner divinity (see fig. 2). Thus, through the analysis of actual plans, I demonstrated that the sacred char- acter of the temple's inner space-both the sanctum itself and its potent center-was given a physical embodiment on the tem- ple's outer walls (fig. 2 and 5). I also illus- trated how architects in different regions, and over several centuries, adjusted their application of this system to provide more subtle proportions as well as greater archi- tectural (and aesthetic) complexity to the temple's plan and elevation (fig. 3).10 Other studies I have made suggest that, in elevation, the curvilinear tower of the northern temple was meant to span the distance from the temple's exterior to the walls of its interior sanctum. Its curvature approximates a segment of a circle, using multiples of the temple's width as radius (fig. 5).11 At its top, a square stone slab (vedi; "altar") capping the temple's tower acted as a vertical extension of the cubical interior chamber (garbhagrha; "womb chamber"). In a few temples, this slab took the actual form of a raised altar.12 Morphology: The neck of a great pillar emerged as an architectural presence above Winter 1990 395</page><page sequence="2">/~J1. /I K 7 / i Figure 2 Siva temple, Mahua, Central India, ca.

This was crowned by a stone fruit in the form of an auspicious seed (dmalaka) and ultimately by a consecrating lustral pot that elevated the actual earthen pot, buried with germinating seeds, placed by priests at the center of the temple's foundation.13 Extending vertically through the central "sacred ground" (brahmasthana) of the sanctum, with its image of divinity, this "invisible" pillar marked the center of the sanctum as a point of cosmic origination (fig. 7). As both an altar and an axis-validating and empowering each location picked for worship-the type of stone temple created for use in north India from the fifth century A.D. employed specific and bold architec- tural forms to represent its mythic and rit- ual meanings. These signal omphalos and axis mundi-as the monument also acts as both "cosmic" and "cosmogonic" diagram-in symbolic, indexical, as well as iconic ways. That is, these forms both are what they are (platform, pillar) index- ically and stand for something they are not (cosmos, cosmogonic moment) symbol- ically; yet, as part of the temple, they share an identity iconically (using Peirce's tri- adic classification) with what they signify, thus assuring the temple's potency as a tool. 14 Symbology: How many ways can architec- ture function as a sign? Roland Barthes has observed that "it is far from certain that in the social life of today there are to be found any extensive systems of signs outside of human language. . . . We are, much more than in former times," he adds as quali- fication, "a civilization of the written word."15 In Indian inscriptions, literature, and folklore, the temple, for example, stands as a "mountain"-that on which Siva built his palace, that at the center of 396 Art Journal 1 II : i A" \d~ I ? / +? N m I 4 2 7 1 3 5 li</page><page sequence="3">the cosmos, that which "scrapes the sky" and on which the rain-cloud elephants leave their seed in Sanskrit poetry. As a metaphor for the temple, "mountain," however, is only of "indexical" value in Peirce's sense: a system of meaning in its own right, shared by the temple but not defined by it. Homology: That the measurements of the mandala's diagram mark the temple as an altar related to the place of original sacri- fice in Hindu myth of origin, makes the earth, the altar, and the temple homologs and not analogs-that is, different "vi- sions" ("signs") of the same underlying reality. This is also true of the axis mundi, phallic pillar placed in the sanctum and sometimes above the crowning vessel of a Siva temple, and those anthropomorphic images of Siva, Visnu, Brahma, or the Buddha that branch into many figures as a way of suggesting cosmic growth and parturition. 16 The proliferation of parts on the temple's walls itself expresses, not merely repre- sents, cosmic parturition (fig. 3). Images of deities who guard the directions of space (dikpdlas) were placed on the corners of many square temples from the late seventh century, and some temples (remarkable in a stone tradition) developed plans that turn the square, creating a series of regular an- gles that made the monument into a kind of cosmic chronogram.17 As India's archi- tects played with the programmatic re- quirements of the temple over centuries- both ritual and symbolic-they found in- creasingly subtle architectural means to express both. Iconicity: Some might argue that the use of the upper part of a giant pillar, half- hidden altars, and emblems of fruitfulness is not architecture at all (fig. 6), although in an age of Disneyworld hotels with dol- phins this may be an argument hard to sustain. Architectural "iconicity" is an is- sue today, however, in an age when the power of any manmade monument to evoke a mental image of a universal reality (fig. 7) has only fitfully been available to moder architects (and then usually at- tempted only in terms of simple geometric forms). Yet can such a solution-the "iconicity" of a building, in Peirce's cate- gory rather than that of Robert Venturi's building that is a "duck"-still be one available to architects?'8 In developing a symbolic surface for the temple's tower, Indian architects perhaps came closest to the "historical referenc- ing" of a Western postmodernism, but with none of po-mo's ironies or private conceits (fig. 10). We, as scholars, have known for some time that, in addition to its other meanings, the temple was also a "palace," appropriate as a shelter for the Figure 6 Robert deJager, Temple Figure 7 Robert deJager, The Temple Elevation, 1989, watercolor, 7 x 10 Stripped Bare, 1989, watercolor, 7 x 10 inches. Private collection. inches. Private collection. anthropomorphised divinity within. This fact has been expressed both by names given to the temple in texts (such as prd- sada; palace) and by its architectural ve- neer. Scholars have long counted the cor- ner ribbed stones of the north Indian tower as a means to number its "stories" (figs. 6 and 10); my recently published decoding of the temple's richly ornamented faqade, however, has suggested that a much more complex system than that was at work. 19 Surface: For many hundreds of years be- fore temples began to be built in north India in the fifth century A.D., stone carvers had experimented with a process abstracting architectural forms from the ur- ban wood architecture of ancient India as a means to create carved faqades for Bud- dhist and Jaina caves. Already in these excavated temples, such referencing had a sign value rather than a structural one, and the language created was at least as abstract and flexible as that which governs the dec- orative veneer of a skyscraper today.20 The architects who built the few brick temples in central India that have survived from as early as the seventh century A:D. (fig. 8) condensed and reordered, but es- sentially still replicated, architectural ele- ments of an Indian palace in their towers (figs. 8 and 9). In this example, small pil- lared pavilions with domes stand as ae- diculae on the corners of each story; cen- tral projecting pent-roofed balconies are faced by typical Indian barrel dormers; and the small segments of a cloister that con- nect these structures suggest an open ter- race behind (fig. 9). The density of symbolism built into the Indian temple by architectural means is greater than these brick structures show, however. In the accompanying drawings, I have attempted to demonstrate ways by which the surface veneer that architects developed for stone temples in north India in the sixth and seventh centuries A.D. (fig. 10) went intentionally beyond such a struc- turally feasible palatial formula (fig. 9), transforming the temple's surface seman- tically by use of multivalent architectural referencing. The ornament of the stone tower in the seventh century (fig. 10) visibly still repre- sented cloisters to enclose each terrace; central spines of interlocking barrel win- dows acted in place of dormers; and ae- diculae supporting ribbed stones (am- alakas) marked each terrace corner (figs. 10 and 11). Such a morphology "signs" the palatial nature of the tower; each part, how- ever, here has been transformed into a "homolog." The out-turned central dor- mers on each story (fig. 8) have become a single, infinitely extendable, web of win- dows to clasp the tower like a sheath Winter 1990 397</page><page sequence="4">(fig. 10). The corer pavilions have be- come altarlike platforms instead of open pillared structures, made up of a series of laminated cornices and each crowned by a ribbed-stone amalaka (a seedlike form used also as a pillar-capital), as is the tower itself (fig. 11). Each of these aediculae has become, in part, the temple's "replica"- like the fragment of a hologram- marking, as do all temples, once more the place and nature of original creation. As sign, these aediculae measure stories in- dexically, signal "palace" symbolically, and stand as an "altar/temple" iconically. Elsewhere I have called this process of architectural replacement "symbolic sub- stitution," and the history of its architec- tural development in India can be sporad- ically traced throughout the fifth and sixth centuries A.D. from a variety of fragmen- tary remains.21 It makes of the temple a proliferation of homologous "points," ex- pressing, in architectural terms, an Indian understanding of the created universe as an infinitely extendable "atomic" reality. In this sense, I have stated that the Indian temple begins with a "singularity," with much the same meaning as that given today by quantum physics: "a point in space- time at which the space-time curvature be- comes infinite."22 Historicity: The temple, however, once built, exists in space-time. The potency of the form that architects were able to create was put to programmatic use. The "his- tory" of the temple is one of changing patronage, ritual use through time, and the incorporation of images that represent an evolving iconography. (Dennis Hudson's current study of the images on one particu- lar south Indian temple demonstrates the density by which a temple and its icon- ography could effectively be molded to fit a particular local use.)23 In north India, the period when temple building spread widely across the hinterland corre- sponded, in part, to a shift from "lineage"- to "state"-based societies. Ties connec- ting state-patronage, local clans, and communities of priests in the diffusion of temple building have only begun to be explored.24 For the period from the fifth to the fif- teenth century-separate from the devel- opment of the morphology that gave the temple its potent "sign" value-a more traditional architectural history of this building type could also be written, deal- ing with the evolution of form, definition of enclosed space, dissemination, and re- gional differentiation. The initial require- ment for every temple has been to provide shelter for an image in the sanctum and for the individual worshiper, usually in the form of a portico. As changing religious requirements encouraged the worship of multiple deities representing the single Figure 8 Axonometric drawing (crowning ribbed stone restored), Rajivalochana temple, Rajim, Central India, ca.

Figure 11 Drawing: detail to suggest the palatial implications of the Garuda Brahma's veneer. 398 Art Journal</page><page sequence="5">central divinity, temples began to be built on platforms, with surrounding subsidiary shrines (each still founded on its own sa- cred diagram). Temples were given en- closed ambulatory paths; enclosed halls; expanded open front halls with balconies; spaces for dance and music, or even the preparation of food. Different regions de- veloped separate solutions for such chang- ing public and ritual requirements. Tech- nology also evolved, allowing architects to build larger and more complex structures (figs. 1 and 4); the development of tech- niques for constructing elaborate large cor- belled ceilings, for example, made possi- ble a whole history of expanded interior spaces. Such diachronic differentiation is, of course, a proper subject for art-historical research and has been the focus for a cer- tain amount of recent work.25 Synchronicity: Synchronically, however, the center of the monument-what Kramrisch called "the four-cornered cita- del of the gods"-remained the square of the sanctum, with its walls proliferating in the cardinal directions.26 Its vertical axis was met by another, longitudinal axis- that of the worshiper's approach-which became the axis along which the temple as a monument for human use tended to be elaborated through time. By the medieval period, architects had created a ritually coequal space for the worshiper along this "axis of access" as a separate hall, meas- ured by its own grid and sheltered by a corbelled ceiling that homologously re- sembled the umbrella sheltering the sacri- ficer at a Vedic ritual (fig. 4).27 Barthes ends his essay on the "elements of semiology" with a statement challeng- ing the determination of a time span for a synchronic sample: "in principle, the corpus must eliminate diachronic elements to the utmost; it must coincide with a state of the system, a cross-section of history. . . . [But] it is impossible to guess the speed at which systems will alter, since the essential aim of semiological research may be precisely to discover the system's own particular time, the history of forms."28 In this respect, synchrony is less a mat- ter of "occurring at the same time" as it is of "having identical period and phase." A "synchronous orbit," for example, is one that has "a period the same as the period of axial rotation of the earth and so oriented that any body in it maintains a position over one point on the earth's surface."29 The temples I have been analyzing dem- onstrate, I think, the degree to which syn- chrony and diachrony can coexist in one saturated sample. Collectively, they pro- vide a physical "text" with "separate seg- ments (stories) which differ in detail but which are also in some respects similar," thus fitting Edmund Leach's "prerequi- sites" for a structural analysis: Taken together, these similar stories form a set. The items in the set can be compared and contrasted .... The establishment of the patterns and the contrasts between them call for close attention to very fine details in the texts under consideration. Ide- ally, the analysis should take account of every detail; it is a presupposition of the distinctive-feature thesis that, while the text may contain redundan- cies, it cannot contain accidents. Every detail adds something to the cogency of the message.30 The Indian temple can be an exemplar of the possibilities for a structural analysis of visual material. It is conceivably unique, however, in the "syncronicity" of its cos- mological image. Though both Peirce and Barthes dealt with visual signs as well as language, a bias toward "langue" and "parole" (in their linguistic sense) can be found throughout the theoretical literature. R. M. Martin sums this up in his recent statement that "the study of nonlinguistic signs harks back to the medieval period. . [I]t has not yet achieved the exactitude of logical semiotics and, pending such a development, remains somewhat contro- versial."31 Perhaps, however, it is always only a matter of defining the proper set. Particularity: In the Indian context, in fact, it is possible to begin to define the limits to the "system's own particular time"32 in the case of the north Indian temple. By the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, although temples that followed the signature form of curvilinear tower still were built in north India, the "system" of form had begun to lose its "period and phase." An architect such as Mandana, for example, who wrote and built in western India in the fifteenth century under the renascent Hindu patronage of Rana Kumbha at Chittor, was already self- consciously attempting to reestablish the traditional system he found in texts.33 By the eighteenth century, Mughal modes of building were increasingly adopted even by Hindu rulers, and a new hall type of temple ("haveli type") became common. A symptom of systemic "wobble" can be seen during this period in the wide- spread introduction along the comers of curvilinear towers of an aberrant decora- tive element used to replace the altar seg- ments marked by ribbed amalaka stones (figs. 10 and 11) found throughout the pre- vious history of the type. Instead, a chain of vases, with foliage flowing over their lips (the so-called vase-of-plenty or pur- naghata motif, another of India's ancient forms), was used to ornament the corer bands of the tower. While the use of such an image further denoted parturition-one previously con- notative meaning of the temple-it could Figure 12 Oakland cinema, Oakland, California. do so only at the expense of the palatial morphology built into the temple's veneer by previous architects. The sign system as a whole had become weakened by either loss of memory or misuse. Temple architecture in India, while giv- ing body to a deeply rooted structure of cosmological belief, deals with "univer- sals" within that system, not inherently. It represents a semantic system rooted within a context, however extended. Taken out of that context, as in its use to ornament an Oakland, California, movie theater (fig. 12), even the temple's potent tower can be decoded only as part of a wildly different system of "signs." Indexically "a tower," symbolically "exotic," this "pre-mo" (rather than "po-mo") structure iconically can be only what its signboard represents, this designated place for showing the eva- nescence of cinema.
