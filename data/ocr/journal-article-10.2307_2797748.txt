<plain_text><page sequence="1">234 Bronze Age Technology. Cf. MAN, 1958, 13, 39, 64, 173; 1959, 137, 209 The retiring Honorary Editor of MAN would like to set right, so far as that is now possible, an injustice unintentionally done by him, jointly with the Deputy Keeper of Ethnography in the British Museum, to Mr. Henry Hodges some six years ago. It may be recalled that a remarkable series of three articles on Bronze Age technology in Europe and Asia by the sculptor and technologist Mr. Leon Underwood had led to some correspondence in MAN, in the course of which Mr. Hodges questioned Mr. Underwood's main thesis of the extensive use of the lost-wax method in the mass production of Bronze Age weapons, and incidentally his interpretation-really an obiter dictum not germane to the main theme-of what he had described as a 'blade- guard' on a shafthole axe from Ur. In a contribution to the dis- cussion (1958, 173), Mr. William Fagg had implied the possibility that Mr. Hodges's interpretation of this phenomenon might be accounted for by unfamiliarity with the object; having later learned that such an implication was unfounded, he withdrew it in a note appended to 1959, 209, while maintaining his surprise at the interpretation itself, which seemed to attribute an anthropomorphic purpose to the natural forces of corrosion. To this Mr. Hodges rejoined with the following letter, received by the Honorary Editor on 30 October, 1959: ' SIR,-I am sorry that Mr. Fagg finds himself unable to make a tardy apology without indulging in a Parthian shot. Since Mr. Fagg has once again raised the subject of the "blade-guard" on the axehead from Ur, I would like to make the following observations, if only to clarify the issues to the readers of MAN. 'In the first place the "blade-guard" contains no metallic bronze, but is totally mineralized; and that mineralization is quite typical of many bronzes from the Near and Middle East. 'The "blade-guard" is not a single, solid object as one might suppose from Mr. Underwood's sketch. It is brittle, fissured, and made up of at least four fragments, at one time held into position by an adhesive. During the conservation treatment of this object, that was still actively corroding, some of these fragments have come unstuck. ' On the butt end of the same axe is a thick wedge of mineral- ization similar in character to the so-called "blade-guard." 'These are the simple, undeniable facts. If anyone wishes to see in this lump of mineralized matter the likeness to a "blade- guard," that is his concern. From the facts set down above only, those who have studied the corrosion of bronze will be able to form their own, and I suspect rather different, con- clusions; for the much hammered edges of bronze implements are generally those areas to suffer the heaviest corrosion, and one needs but a rudimentary knowledge of metallography to appreciate why this should be so. H. W. M. HODGES' Institute of Arch~otogy, University of London The Honorary Editor at once formed the firm intention of publishing this letter, but, wishing to append a comment to it in his other capacity, felt under the obligation of making a fresh inspection of the piece rather than relying on his memory of his original examin- ation, a year or so earlier, with Mr. R. M. Organ, then of the Research Laboratory of the British Museum. He accordingly enquired for it on two or three occasions over a period of months, but it was by then undergoing an extended course of treatment which made its examination at that time inconvenient. It may also be that this postponement was compounded by the fact that the Honorary Editor and the Deputy Keeper were too ready to make allowances for each other's difficulties, then and later, in meeting their many commitments. The apology for this unconscionable delay is unreserved; yet Mr. Hodges would hardly expect (in spite of the implication of his first sentence above) that such a weakness of position in point of procedure should lead to a concession of the matter at issue. Mr. Fagg writes: 'The Ur axehead has now been found, after a search for which I am most grateful to the Department of Western Asiatic Antiquities, to be still "in soak" in the Research Laboratory, and I have carefully examined it. Interpretation is now further obscured by new deposition under treatment, though the fragments of the "guard" can now be examined on both their surfaces. Mr. Hodges's metallographic exposition is, of course, theoretically un- exceptionable, and his interpretation cannot, I think, be ruled out; I will abstain therefore from any Parthian shots (e.g. that I am now looking forward to buying the first monkey-typed edition of Shakespeare's works). Yet both surfaces of the "guard" fragments seem much smoother and more clearly artifactual than the cutting surfaces of the blade itself, and the probabilities still seem to favour Mr. Underwood's view.'</page></plain_text>
