<plain_text><page sequence="1">God, Israel and Covenant GOD, ISRAEL AND COVENANT: UNITY IN THE BOOK OF DEUTERONOMY1 Susan Haber* Within the framework of Deuteronomy, there is an underlying theme of unity: One God, who causes His name to dwell in one place, has chosen one people, Israel, to enter into a covenantal relationship. The Deuteronomic covenant focuses on the individual as a member of the covenantal community and man- dates an exclusive allegiance to God through observance of the law. It is the premise of this author that the covenant is the source of unity in Deuteronomy. It not only defines the relationship between God and Israel, it is the force that unifies the people of Israel as a nation, and elucidates the nature of the singu- lar God whom they serve. Hence, this essay will explore the theme of unity in Deuteronomy from the perspective of the covenant between God and Israel. Deuteronomy and Covenant In essence, Deuteronomy is a book of religious instruction, presented as a covenant between YHWH and Israel. The Hebrew word berit or covenant is synonymous with 'commandment' and 'law', and implies liability or obliga- tion. (Weinfeld, 1977, p.255) This notion of liability unfolds as follows: first, YHWH elects Israel from among the nations to be His special people, and gives her the gift of His covenant; second, Israel responds by accepting the covenant and agreeing to be exclusively loyal to YHWH by keeping His laws. Israel is constantly being warned to sh-m-r (keep) the commandments and is admonished against transgressing the law. (Eichrodt, 1961, p.54) Third, the berit is effectively signed and sealed with its deposit into the Ark, which enshrines the covenant documents. The covenantal character of Deuteronomy is emphasised by the appellation given to the book by its author, who calls it sefer ha-Torah, 'book of the law'. (Weinfeld, 1991, pp. 17-8) The expression ha-Torah hazot , 'this ToraK (1:5; 4:8,44; 6:1-2,6-9; 17:19-20; 28:58; 29:19; 31:11-12), is not found in theTetra- teuch and technically refers only to the book of Deuteronomy. Although the term Torah is generally rendered as 'instruction' or 'teaching', its connotation in Deuteronomy has been expanded to encompass the Mosaic law, as well as * Susan Hab√®r, BSc. is a student of Hebrew Bible at York University, Canada, and is currently the Chairman of Adult Study at Adath Israel Congregation.

(Tigay, 1996, Note to 1:5) Stylistically, the covenant form of Deuteronomy is patterned after two other models of covenant from the ancient Near East: the Hittite suzerainty treaty of the second millennium and the Assyrian loyalty oath of the first millennium. All the basic elements of a Hittite treaty text are found in Deuteronomy.2 Fur- thermore, there are aspects of Deuteronomy which resemble the (Assyrian) vassal treaties of Esarhaddon. (VTE) (Moore, 1997) Both are loyalty oaths imposed by a sovereign on his vassals, in which all the people are gathered (Deut. 29:9-1 1 , VTE 4-5) to take a pledge for both themselves and future gen- erations. (Deut. 29:14, VTE 6-7) Additionally, in both documents the loyalty of the vassal towards his suzerain is expressed using identical terminology; in each instance the vassal is commanded to 'love' his/her suzerain 'with all your heart and all your soul'. (Deut. 6:5) (Weinfeld, 1991, pp.6-9) The covenant, which expressed a political relationship in the ancient Near East, was adapted by Israel to express a theological relationship. As old polit- ical formulations were imbued with new theological significance, elements of the covenant model, such as the gathering of the whole population and the expression of loyalty to the sovereign, were redefined to establish a unity of Israel, and a unified fidelity to a singular God. Israel and Covenant Inherent in the composition of Deuteronomy is an assumption of the unity of Israel. This solidarity is implicit in the identification of the recipients of the covenant as being both the 'people of Israel' and the 'generations of Israel'. (Lohfink, 1994, pp.229-30) The former is expressed in terms of a fellowship of all Israel and represents a horizontal unity within any given generation, whereas the latter is manifested as a vertical unity across successive genera- tions throughout history. Hence, the bonds of the covenant inextricably con- nect every individual of every generation, one to the other. The horizontal unity of Israel is emphasised through references to members of the covenant as being ahim or brothers. (1:16; 3:18,20; 10:9; 15:3,7,9,11) This terminology not only stresses the equality and fraternity of the Israelites, it is a genealogical expression of kinship, inherited from the patriarchal period, in which all the tribal leaders were perceived as brothers, descending from one father, Jacob/Israel. (Eichrodt, 1967, p.238) Deuteronomy expands this idea of genealogical relationship by asserting that all the tribes are in reality one uni- fied people, whose Father and Creator is God. (Mendenhall, 1990, p.90) 'Is not He the Father who created you, fashioned you and made you endure!' (Deut. EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 32 No. 1 SPRING '99 133</page><page sequence="3">God, Israel and Covenant 32:6b). In the context of the Father-son relationship of the covenant,3 the peo- ple of Israel become brothers. The unity of Israel is established in the very first verse and is emphasised throughout Deuteronomy (5:1; 27:9; 29:1; 31:1; 32:45), as Moses addresses kol Yisra 'el (all Israel). Included in kol are all the categories of individuals that constitute the community, as is evident in the following passage: You stand this day, all of you, before YHWH your God - your tribal heads, your elders and your officials, all the men of Israel, your children, your wives, even the stranger within your camp, from wood-chopper to water-drawer - to enter into the covenant of YHWH your God, which YHWH your God is concluding with you this day, with its sanctions; to the end that He may establish you this day as His people and be your God, as He promised you and as He swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I make this covenant, with its sanctions, not with you alone, but both with those who are standing here with us this day before YHWH our God and with those who are not with us here this day. (Deut. 29:9- 14)4 There is a solidarity in Israel that transcends any natural or artificial bound- aries, be they gender, tribal or hierarchical. Without exception, it is incumbent on every man, woman and child, regardless of their status in the community, to obey God's will, as set out by the terms of the covenant. Each individual's fulfilment of their covenantal obligations ultimately determines the quality of Israel's unified response to God. (Clements, 1968, p.36) In the above passage, the solidarity of Israel extends beyond the boundaries of time, linking not only members of a single generation, but also binding together successive generations of Israelites. It is not just 'those who are stand- ing here' that take part in the covenant ceremony; it is also 4hose who are not with us' - the future generations of Israel - who are accorded an emphatic con- temporaneity at Sinai. (Rad, 1984, p.29) This connection of a future generation to the past is made evident by the usage of the verb z-kh-r (remember) which appears thirteen times in Deuteron- omy (5:15; 7:18; 8:2,18; 9:7; 15:15; 16:3,12; 24:9,18,22; 25:17; 32:7). According to Childs (1962, pp.50-6, 74-85), there are two functions of mem- ory. In one usage, memory takes on a theological significance, bridging the gap between the redemptive acts of the past and the new generation that did not witness these events. Each generation of Israel is made aware that God's redemptive role is ongoing and not confined to some past event. It is, and has always been, Israel's steadfast loyalty to the covenant that ensures God's con- tinued benevolence. In a second aspect of memory, the connection between the covenant and Israel's history is reversed. In this usage, each generation of Israel must observe the commandments in order to re-enact the historically 134 EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 32 No. 1 SPRING '99</page><page sequence="4">Susan Haber decisive events of her past.5 Memory provides a link between past and present, and ultimately unites the generations of Israel. The inter-generational unity of Israel is future-oriented as well. In Deuteronomy, the connection to future generations of Israelites is facilitated through the teaching of the children: veshinantam levanekha vedibarta bam , 'Impress them upon your children . . . '(6:7) The children are not only to be pre- sent during the covenant ceremony, but it is incumbent on every individual to pass on the traditions of the people to their children. The link to future gener- ations is ensured through a programme of religious instruction in which every individual, including children, is taught the stipulations of the covenant. (Clements, 1968, p. 13) Inter-generational boundaries are often blurred in Deuteronomy, creating yet another allusion to the unity of Israel. Polzin (1993, p.72), in his literary analy- sis of Deuteronomy, identifies two generations of Israel: the first generation is that of Moses and his audience outside the land, waiting to possess it, as per the divine promise; the second is that of the narrator and his audience, who are in exile after the destruction of the Temple. They, too, are outside the land, hoping to repossess it, with the help of God. Through the voices of Moses and the nar- rator, respectively, the first audience is told how they will acquire the land, and the second, how they will regain it. By the end of the book, the two voices are virtually indistinguishable, as the 4his day' of Moses merges with the 4his day' of the narrator and the two generations integrate, one with the other. God and Covenant Deuteronomy eschews corporeal and anthropomorphic conceptions of God. The God of the Deuteronomic covenant is a transcendent God who is outside the realm of nature. He is near to His people, Israel (4:7), but only in a spiri- tual context (Tigay, 1996, p.xiii), for He dwells only in His heavenly abode and is never perceived to be physically present on earth. This transcendence of God is clearly indicated in the Deuteronomic account of the theophany: You came forward and stood at the foot of the mountain. The mountain was ablaze with flames to the very skies, dark with densest clouds. YHWH spoke to you out of the fire; you heard the sound of words but perceived no shape - nothing but a voice. (Deut. 4:1 1-12) From the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline you; on earth He let you see His great fire: and from amidst that fire you heard his words. (Deut. 4:36) In contrast to the JE narrative, in which 'YHWH came down upon Mount Sinai ...' (Exod. 19:20), the Deuteronomic account omits any reference to EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 32 No. 1 SPRING '99 1 35</page><page sequence="5">God, Israel and Covenant God descending to earth before speaking to the people. The commandments were heard coming from the midst of the fire, the symbol of God's essence,6 but God spoke directly from His heavenly abode. The emphasis in the above passages is on hearing, rather than seeing, since an auditory experience is less concrete and more ephemeral. There is never any danger of seeing God in Deuteronomy;7 a danger expressed in the earlier books of the Pentateuch: '... for man may not see Me and live'. (Exod. 33:20) The danger here is in hearing His voice: 'Has any people heard the voice of a god speaking out of a fire, as you have, and survived?' (Deut. 4:33) The shift in emphasis from visual to oral accentuates the non-corporeal transcendent nature of God. (Clements, 1965, pp.89-91) The anti-anthropomorphic conception of God is based in the theology of the covenant and is related to the centralisation of the Temple. The idea of a God who dwells permanently in the shrines of Israel insinuates that God is immanent and that His blessings are unconditional. This kind of theology blurs the contingent nature of the covenant which depends on Israel's fulfil- ment of the commandments and ultimately threatens the viability of the covenantal relationship. For this reason, God as described in the Deutero- nomic covenant is completely divorced from any notion or institution that ties Him to the realm of nature. (Clements, 1965, p.97) In particular, the transcen- dent nature of God is emphasised through the centralisation of the cult at a sin- gle sanctuary:'... the site where YHWH your God will choose ... to establish His name there'. (Deut. 12:4) According to Tigay: 'Deuteronomy seeks to correct the impression that God Himself literally dwells there: only His name "dwells" there, whereas God Himself is in heaven'.8 The transcendent God of the Deuteronomic covenant is characterised as the divine lawgiver, whom Israel obeys. In fact, the idea of the kingship of God, which was prevalent throughout the ancient Near East, may have been a con- tributing factor in the development of the relationship between the vassal Israel and her suzerain YHWH. (Weinfeld, 1 972, pp.82-3) Although there is no defin- itive reference to God as melekh (king) in the book of Deuteronomy,9 the con- cept of His exclusive and divine sovereignty over Israel is clearly expressed in the Shema. Shema Yisra 'el YHWH eloheinu YHWH ehad (Deut. 6:4) may be interpreted in at least three different ways: Hear –û Israel! - (1) YHWH is our God, YHWH alone; (2) YHWH our God is one YHWH; (3) YHWH our God, YHWH is one. Although scholars do not agree on the correct translation of this passage, each of these translations offers some possible insights into the Deuteronomic concept of God from the perspective of the covenant. The first rendering of this verse, found in the NJPS translation, reflects the exclusivity of YHWH as the singular God of Israel. According to the terms of the covenant, the suzerain, YHWH, is the exclusive God of His vassal, Israel. 136 EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 32 No. 1 SPRING '99</page><page sequence="6">Susan Haber Although other nations may worship other deities, Israel recognises YHWH as her one and only God. As Rashbam comments: 'The Lord alone is our God; we have no other aside from Him ... We will worship Him alone; we will not combine any other god with Him ...'10 Here, as in Zechariah 14:9, 11 the word ehad means alone. This command to worship YHWH alone is an exhortation against idolatry, a pervasive theme in Deuteronomy. This prohibition against 'walking after'12 other gods is so strong that the exclusive loyalty to YHWH supersedes even the closest family relationship: If your brother, your own mother's son, or your son or daughter, or the wife of your bosom, or your closest friend entices you in secret, saying, 'Come let us worship other gods' ... do not shield him; but take his life. (Deut. 13:7-10) This absolute injunction prohibits leniency and forgiveness even in a situ- ation where familial bonds interfere with one's absolute loyalty to God. The intent of this categorical imperative is to unify Israel against idolatry and ensure absolute allegiance to YHWH alone. That the commitment to God supersedes the sanctity of life, the integrity of the family and the judicial process,13 illustrates the paramount significance of God's exclusivity in Israel. The second translation, which indicates that YHWH is one God (and not many), is seen as a polemic against the ancient Near East practice of referring to a divinity by its name and location of worship. This form of reference may have been used in Israel, as is evidenced by the discovery of ancient Hebrew inscriptions at Kuntillet 4 Ajrud referring to 4 YHWH of Samaria' and 'YHWH of Teman'. (McCarter, 1997, pp.61-5) This speech pattern implies a division of YHWH into a multitude of deities. In light of the possibility of local mani- festations of YHWH, the phrase 'YHWH is one' rejects the disintegration of Israel's one God into many. The third interpretation asserts that God is unique and incomparable. This idea is argued by Bergman and Lohfink (1977, p. 196) who suggest that God's uniqueness is connected to the love motif found in ancient Near East treaties: 'As the God whom Israel loves, Yahweh is Israel's only one and unique one' This interpretation of the unity of God is also related to the concept of king- ship, as indicated by an Ugaritic text in which the god declares: 'I am one [= alone] who rules over the gods'. (Weinfeld, 1991, pp.350- 1) The three different interpretations of the Shema are each firmly grounded in the covenant form. YHWH is Israel's exclusive God; YHWH is one YHWH; YHWH is unique. Although the theological implications of these alternatives vary, their origin is the same. God's unity is derived from and is expressed in terms of the covenant that He has bestowed upon Israel. EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 32 No. 1 SPRING '99 1 37</page><page sequence="7">God, Israel and Covenant God, Israel and Covenant Ultimately, the covenant between God and Israel defines the relationship that binds them together, and unifies them in an eternal alliance. Israel's acceptance of YHWH as her exclusive God is not a simple unilateral agreement, but rec- iprocal and contingent on God's fidelity. Deuteronomy's emphasis on the faithfulness of YHWH is expressed in terms of a recurrent motif: the oath and promise made to the ancestors for progeny and land. As all Israel stands at the threshold of the land, their very existence is evidence that the first half of the promise, that of progeny, has been realised. The entrance into the land, how- ever, represents more than the fulfilment of the second half of God's promise. In the context of the covenant, it is a testament to the faithfulness of the God who made that promise. (Janzen, 1987, p.291) With this in mind, it is possible to view the Shema in conjunction with the verse that follows, as the definitive statement of the relationship between God and Israel. 'Hear –û Israel, YHWH our God, YHWH is one. You shall love YHWH your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.' (Deut. 6:4-5) As in other ancient Near East treaties, the term 'love' in this passage connotes loyalty. It is a love that can be commanded because it is a covenantal love (Moran, 1963) and is predicated on God's moral character, as we see in the juxtaposition of the two above verses. Only after YHWH is iden- tified as a faithful God who keeps His promises, can Israel be appropriately com- manded to wholehearted loyalty. 'Know, therefore, that only YHWH your God is God, the steadfast God who keeps His covenant faithfully to the thousandth generation of those who love Him and keep His commandments.' (Deut. 7:9) In this context, ehad is a statement of the moral integrity of God and His fidelity to the promises that were made to the ancestors. (Janzen, 1987, pp.291-2) In the context of the relationship between YHWH and Israel, Deut. 6:4-5 can be interpreted as follows: YHWH elects Israel as His precious people and fulfils the promises that He made to the patriarchs. These promises are YHWH's obligation to Israel in the context of the covenant. In return, Israel accepts the covenant by pledging her exclusive loyalty to God and her faith- fulness to His commandments. Finally, the document of the covenant is deposited in the Ark as a reminder to this generation and to all future genera- tions. However, the covenant is not a simple bipolar agreement between YHWH and Israel. It is also a 'fellowship' agreement amongst the members of the covenant. Imagine God at the apex of a triangle and the Israelites at each of the two base angles. Each member of the covenantal community is man- dated by God to relate to his neighbour in accordance with the laws of the covenant, thus binding the Israelite vassals, not only to God, but to one another. Hence, the covenant also serves as the foundation for social ethics, 138 EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 32 No. 1 SPRING '99</page><page sequence="8">Susan Haber with particular emphasis being placed on legislation regarding the poor and most disadvantaged members of the community. (Levenson, 1985, pp.53-4) The covenant between God and Israel is unique in its thrust towards unifi- cation. In the fulfilment of each and every stipulation, both the bonds within the Israelite community and those between God and Israel are strengthened. As the Israelites observe the commandments that are directed towards God, they are bound together in solidarity, unified as a nation in the worship of a single deity. Similarly, in their observance of the stipulations which involve social ethics, the Israelites not only strengthen the bonds within their commu- nity, they also fulfil the will of their God. The vassal, Israel, and her divine suzerain, YHWH, are unified by the bonds of the covenant in an eternal trian- gular relationship. One God, one people, bound together by one covenant. Notes 1 . I would like to gratefully acknowledge the invaluable support of my teacher, Profes- sor Carl S. Ehrlich, who generously offered his direction and guidance in the research- ing of this article. 2. See Mendenhall, 1954; McCarthy, 1978, pp.5 1-85. In accordance with Mendenhall's classification, examples of treaty elements found in Deuteronomy are: preamble (5:6); historical prologue (1:6-3:29); stipulations of the treaty (12:1-26:15); provision for deposit and public reading (31:10-12, 25-26); divine witnesses (4:26, 30:19, 31:28, 32: 1); blessings and curses (chap. 28). With respect to the preamble, it should be noted that 'I am YHWH your God . . . ' is an identifying statement of God as the divine author of the covenant. Due to the style in which Deuteronomy was written, it would not be difficult to mistake the author of the covenant as being Moses, rather than God. The identity of God as divine commander and author of the covenant is therefore empha- sised by the use of expressions such as 'YHWH your God' (276 times) and 'YHWH our God' (23 times) throughout Deuteronomy. (Weinfeld, 1991, Note to 6:1) 3. In ancient Near East treaties, the father-son relationship was used as a metaphor for the relationship between the suzerain and his vassal. 4. All quotations from the Hebrew Bible are in accordance with the NJPS translation, unless otherwise stated. The tetragrammaton has been transliterated as YHWH, rather than translated as 'the LORD'. 5. The concept of all generations of Israel being present at the time of the Exodus has been preserved in present-day Jewish tradition. As the Mishnah and the Passover Hag- gadah state: 'In every generation one must view oneself as if he (personally) came out of Egypt ... It was not only our ancestors that the Holy One, Blessed be He, redeemed, but us, too, with them.' (Tigay, 1996, Note to 4:9) 6. Fire is elusive in that it cannot be grasped or contained. This amorphous nature of fire makes it an anti -anthropomorphic symbol of God's essence. 7. In Deut. 5:4, YHWH speaks to the people out of the fire, partim el partim , 'face to face'. The same phraseology is used in 34:10, with reference to the relationship between YHWH and his prophet, Moses. According to Tigay (1996, Notes to 5:4; EUROPEAN JUDAISM VOLUME 32 No. 1 SPRING '99 139</page><page sequence="9">God, Israel and Covenant 34: 10), this idiom does not imply that either the people or Moses saw God's face, but rather, that the contact with God is direct and without mediation. 8. The phrase laswn shemo sham , 'to establish His name there' (1 2:4; 12:21 ; 14:24) is used interchangeably with the phrase leshakein shemo sham , 'to make His name dwell' (14:23; 16:2,6,11; 26:2) (Tigay, 1996, Note to 12:4) Although Deuteronomy links this Name theology to the centralisation of the Temple, they are in reality two separate the- ologies, each of which is based on the conception of a transcendent God. The centrali- sation of the Temple can be traced to the seventh century –í–°–ï and the threat of destruction after the demise of the Northern Kingdom. (Clements, 1968, pp.43-5) The Name theology, which emphasises God's transcendence by rendering Him invulnerable to any calamity that may affect the Temple, probably arose after the plundering of the Temple in 597 and reached its full development after the Temple's destruction in 586. (Mettinger, 1982, pp.38-62) Hence, the conception of God in Deuteronomy results from a synthesis of two theologies, which are rooted in different historical realities. 9. The use of the word melekh in Deut. 33:5 is ambiguous in that it may be a reference to either God or Moses. (Brettler, 1989, Note 2, pp. 172-3) It is possible that Deuteron- omy intentionally avoids referring to God as king due to the anthropocentric nature of the metaphor. While an implicit characterisation of God as king is certainly apparent in Deuteronomy and essential to the covenantal perspective, the use of a royal appel- lation which invokes images of a corporeal God is incompatible with the book's con- ception of a transcendent God. This view is supported by Kreuzer (1995, as cited by Watts, 1996, p.8) who differentiates between the use of the word adon (lord) to depict God as a sovereign over Israel, and the word melekh , which designates Him as a ruler over nature and the divine realms. Since Deuteronomy is concerned with God's sov- ereignty over Israel, it designates YHWH as adoney ha'adonim, 'Lord of lords' (Deut. 10:17), a royal description similar to epithets accorded to kings in the ancient Near East. (Tigay, 1996, Note to 10:17) 10. I am grateful to my teacher, Professor Martin I. Lockshin, for bringing this reference to my attention. 1 1 . 'And YHWH shall be king over all the earth; in that day there shall be one YHWH with one name.' According to Zechariah, there will come a time when not only Israel, but all of humanity will worship YHWH exclusively. (Tigay, 1996, Note to 6:4) 1 2. In the ancient Near East, this terminology was used to express loyalty to the sovereign. (Weinfeld, 1991, p.7) 1 3. This law is problematic in that the incitement occurs in secret, thereby bypassing due judicial process in which two witnesses are required in capital offenses. The full sever- ity of this law is only realised when one considers the translation of velo tekhaseh alav which is rendered here as 'do not shield him'. Levinson (1996) contends that tekhaseh alav has a connotation of physically covering something and can be related to the Hit- tite law of punishing rebels by burying them alive. Relating this to the above law, one might consider an allusion to God treating apostates as premature corpses.
