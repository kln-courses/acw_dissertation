Located on a bluff on the northwest tip of Point Grey, the Point Grey site was a single component occupation of the Marpole Culture (2400-1600 BP). Specifically, the focus here is to investigate how this site was used by its Marpole occupants, and given its function, how the Point Grey site contributes to a better understanding of Marpole settlement and subsistence patterns. The "hallmarks" of the Marpole culture of the Gulf of Georgia region were ranked society and sedentary or semi-sedentary life in large permanent villages (Borden 1 968, 1970; Mitchell 1971; Burley 1980). Most archaeologists would agree that these aspects of the culture did not develop independently, but rather were closely linked to the intensification of resource production, focusing specifically on salmon (Burley 1979; Ames 1981 ; Matson 1983). The shift from the generalized hunting and gathering pattern of the preceding Locarno Beach Culture to the intensive production of salmon during Marpole times (Burley 1980) would necessarily have created new demands for large- scale labour organization (Burley 1979) and large-scale storage (Schalk 1977; Testart 1982). In turn, these developments would have paved the way for a more sedentary pattern of settlement in large villages (Matson 1985), and for ownership of resources which underlies status inequalities (Ames 1981; Matson 1983). Intensification, as Flannery (1968) and others have noted, is largely an irreversible process. Once people embark on the road to intensification, population density often increases, while new scheduling constraints and new social obligations (Bender 1981) emerge. A positive feedback loop is established, and there is no turning back to the previous adaptation. Even if the primary resource that is being intensively produced is only seasonally available, like salmon, the economic and social changes that are part of the intensification process will likely be felt year round. New exchange commitments and ritual observances emerge, and there is the ever-increasing social pressure to produce a surplus. The social changes associated with intensification can have important ramifica- tions for settlement patterns. One option is for local groups to organize as large, co-ordinated labour units during the season of intensive production, and then revert to a dispersed pattern of mobile foraging in the "off-season." In fact many hunting and gathering groups may have no choice but to do this, if the "off-season" resources are evenly and widely distributed, and cannot support intensive production. In effect, these groups would be practising intensification only "part-time," and their settlement pattern</page><page sequence="2">74 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 of seasonal aggregation and seasonal dispersal would be no different from the classic model of many hunting and gathering societies. Another option is for local groups to remain together as co-ordinated labour units year round. This situation implies that there is no "off-season" from intensive production. Such a situation might occur if one intensifiable resource is available year round, or alternatively if two or more intensifiable resources are seasonally available in sequence. The effect of both situations would be to hold local groups together throughout the year as they practise "full-time" intensification. Certainly either settlement option is possible, and the one that will be chosen will depend largely on the nature and seasonal availability of local resources. My point is simply this: in the competitive world of ranked societies, such as those of the Northwest Coast, full-time intensification is better than part-time intensification. Groups that can maximize production throughout the year will ultimately gain a "prestige advantage" over groups that maximize production for only part of the year. If village organization facilitates large-scale intensive production, and if intensive production is feasible year round, then two important conditions exist for the maintenance of village organization year round. SETTLEMENT AND SUBSISTENCE IN THE GULF OF GEORGIA The historic occupants of the Gulf of Georgia region were the Coast Salish, who like their Marpole predecessors, had large permanent villages, social inequality, and an economy that produced beyond immediate subsistence needs. As a result of these similarities, Marpole settlement patterns are thought to have differed little from those of the Coast Salish (Mitchell 1971 :54; Burley 1980:55). The Coast Salish annual round can be divided into three main periods: winter, spring, and summer-fall. Settlement activities during winter and summer-fall are fairly well known. For example, Barnett (1 955: 21 -22) states that the Cowichan had winter villages in Cowichan Bay, and summer salmon-fishing villages along the lower Fraser River. Summer-fall was a season of intensive salmon production for all Coast Salish. During the winter, the level of subsistence production was diminished. But the process of intensification carried over into winter in two ways. First, in terms of subsistence, winter "piggy-backed" summer-fall in the sense that salmon produced in summer was consumed in winter. Second, winter was a season of important social activities when ceremonies were held, exchanges were made, and alliances were formed. Much of what Coast Salish people produced in summer-fall was intended for winter use. The pattern of separate summer and winter villages was probably typical of many Halkomelem Salish from Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands. Other Coast Salish, especially those who wintered in the Fraser delta area, like the Musqueam, probably occupied the same village in winter and summer-fall. Either way, village residence appears to have been the norm for most Coast Salish in winter and summer-fall. The Coast Salish spring pattern is more obscure, and it may be that settlement and subsistence activities varied considerably among the Coast Salish at this time of year. For example, Mitchell (1971:26) states that in the early spring Cowichan families left their winter villages and moved to the Gulf Islands where they engaged in a variety of resource extraction activities. The nature of their spring settlements is unspecified, but the implication is that, in the pursuit of widely distributed resources, the Cowichan were more dispersed and more mobile in the spring than at other times of the year. Spring appears to have been an "off-season" for the Cowichan in the sense that intensive production was not carried out, and large stores of food were not put up. Not all Coast</page><page sequence="3">Canadian Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 15, 1991 75 Figure 1 The Point Grey site, DhRt-5. Salish broke into small groups at this time of year, however. In a comprehensive study of Coast Salish seasonal settlement patterns, Mitchell (1983:101) has noted that many Coast Salish local groups maintained their village organization in spring. Furthermore, Mitchell has identified three areas -the lower Squamish River, False Narrows, and the north arm of the Fraser River- where larger-than-winter-village size aggregations oc- curred in spring. Coast Salish spring villages and village aggregations seem to have been associated with the procurement of specific resources (Mitchell 1983:101), such as eulachon and herring, that were localized and abundant. For these groups, spring was not an "off-season" from intensive production, and village groups tended to remain together.</page><page sequence="4">76 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 Figure 2 The Point Grey site in 1946: the shell mound on the west edge of the ravine. What were Marpole settlement patterns like in spring? As with the Coast Salish, the situation probably varied amongst local groups. With stored salmon stocks running low in late winter, many Marpole local groups may have left their winter villages, especially if spring resources were not locally available. In some cases, winter village groups may have dispersed into small family or household units who practised residen- tial mobility through the spring. This would follow what appears to have been the Cowichan model. A pattern of settlement dispersal and mobility might be expected where spring resources are widely distributed. But where spring resources were "clumped" (Matson 1985) and highly productive Marpole local groups may have maintained their village organization in spring, even if this meant moving to a new location at the end of the winter. To the extent that productive, localized resources existed in spring, and to the extent that production of these resources required a large organized labour group, the economic and social factors that led to the formation of large villages in winter and summer-fall might be expected to have been operative in spring as well. The Point Grey site provides one example of a Marpole spring village. THE POINT GREY SITE Location and Description The Point Grey site is located on a raised bluff 15-20 metres above the beaches at Spanish Banks, overlooking English Bay and the entrance to Howe Sound (Figure 1 ). A large site, even by coastal standards, the main shell deposits at the Point Grey site covered an area about 80 metres wide and over 200 metres in length. The most extensive</page><page sequence="5">Canadian Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 15, 1991 77 Figure 3 Canoe skids on Spanish Banks Beach below the Point Grey site, 1946. deposits were on the west side of Third Ravine, but scattered midden was also found on the east side of the ravine (Borden n.d.). Located in an urban setting, the natural vegetation that once covered the site is now all but gone. In place of western hemlock, Douglas fir, and red cedar, a large portion of the site is now grass-covered. Much of the site has been landscaped, and at one time part of the site surface was black-topped and used for overflow beach parking for sunbathers. History of Research The existence of the Point Grey site has been known since about the turn of the century, when Roland Dixon of the Jesup North Pacific Expedition, surveyed the north side of Point Grey and recorded a series of "shell heaps" as far east as Jericho Beach. Nothing further was done archaeologically at the Point Grey site until 1946, when C.E. Borden of the University of British Columbia started excavations there (Borden n.d.). The Point Grey site was the first site ever excavated by Borden on the west coast (Figures 2, 3). That year Borden excavated two trenches (I, II) on an undisturbed shell mound on the west edge of the ravine, and ten test pits located 50-150 metres farther west, mainly near the edge of the bluff. Extensive disturbance had already occurred at the site (Owen 1 988), especially in the area of the test pits. Borden returned to the Point Grey site briefly in 1965 to excavate scattered shell deposits east of the ravine. When work resumed at the Point Grey site in 1986, excavations again con- centrated on the area around the shell mound on the west edge of the ravine, first explored by Borden in 1 946. Forty years later this small mound was the only remaining undisturbed portion of the Point Grey site. Two excavation trenches (A, B) were started</page><page sequence="6">78 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 Figure 4 Profile, Trench A, west wall. in 1986. Excavation of Trench Β, just north of the mound, immediately encountered concrete rubble and late historic debris, probably the remains of a camp for tubercular children that was located on the site in the 1920s. Trench A included prehistoric cultural deposit, and excavation of this trench was continued in 1988. Physical and Cultural Stratigraphy Our knowledge of the physical and cultural stratigraphy of the Point Grey site is based on the trench excavations of the small shell mound on the west edge of the ravine, and on the excavations of the 1946 test pits. The shell mound is roughly circular in shape with a diameter of about 25 metres. The matrix, as revealed by the trench excavations, was a series of layers of finely crushed shell, mixed with small portions of humus, silty-sand, charcoal and ash. A total of 1 1 discrete shell layers, ranging in thickness from 5-40cm, were identified in Trench A. The maximum depth of the cultural deposit was 1 .6 metres (Figures 4, 5). Many of the shell layers in Trench A were separated by extremely thin (1-2cm), discontinuous layers of fine-grained silty-sand. A total of six such layers, all devoid of cultural material, were identified. In terms of formation processes, the shell layers represent periods of human use of the site, during which time this part of the site probably functioned as a refuse area. The thin silty-sand layers appear to have formed naturally, and probably represent periods of seasonal site abandonment or disuse of this part of the site. The cultural deposit in the test pits dug by Borden in 1 946 was generally shallower than that of the trenches, averaging about 60-80cm deep. Disturbance caused by logging and landscaping in the area of the test pits probably resulted in the removal of the upper levels of the cultural deposit (Borden n.d.). In some test pits thick lenses of ash were found within the shell matrix, suggesting that processing of resources may have been more common in this part of the site than in the vicinity of the shell mound. Underlying the shell in many of the test pits was a layer of dark sandy soil mixed with numerous cobbles, averaging about 15cm thick (Borden n.d.). Borden noted that artifacts and faunal material were recovered from both the shell and dark soil zones.</page><page sequence="7">Canadian Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 15, 1991 79 Dating On stratigraphie evidence the Point Grey site appears to represent a single cultural component. This interpretation is supported by three radiocarbon age es- timates. A wood charcoal sample recovered by Borden from near the bottom of Trench I yielded a date of 1970±90 BP (Gak 1480) (Wilmeth 1978:78). Of interest here is the fact that Borden recovered and kept this sample in 1946, three years before the radiocarbon dating process was introduced. Two wood charcoal samples recovered from Trench A in 1 986 returned dates of 221 0 ±90 BP (WSU 3573) (85cm below surface) , and 1 690 ± 1 20 BP (WSU 3574) (40cm below surface). All three dates fall within the time frame of the Marpole Culture, and suggest at least a mid-Marpole occupation. Features Rock concentrations were the most frequently occurring type of feature (n = 10) in the trench excavations. These features included small beach cobbles, many of which were fire-cracked. Often referred to as "boiling stones," these cobbles were probably associated with food cooking activities that occurred elsewhere on the site. Rock concentrations varied considerably in size, ranging in weight from 0.7-1 5.2kg, and in number of cobbles from 5-52. Figure 5 Profile, Trench A, Unit 4, north wall.</page><page sequence="8">80 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 Figure 6 Shellfish process- ing feature with curving alignment of rocks from Trench A. The only evidence of domestic activities other than refuse disposal in the shell mound on the western edge of the ravine came from the north end of Trench A, at the base of the north slope of the mound, where the remains of a shellfish steaming or baking pit were recorded. This feature consists of a roughly circular area of concentrated burnt shell and ash, measuring over two metres in diameter by about 40cm deep. A total of 43.13kg of rock, most of it fire-cracked, was recovered from this feature. An unusual aspect of this feature was a curving alignment of eight large beach cobbles arranged around the perimeter of the feature at the north or downslope end (Figure 6). These cobbles were of roughly equal size, averaging about 4.5kg each. Their total weight was 35.7kg. From their alignment along the edge of the feature, these cobbles may have functioned to contain and radiate heat within the feature. As noted previously, most of the shell in the trench excavations was very finely crushed mussel. Near the bottom of the shell deposit of Trench A, however, a small concentration of whole littleneck and butter clam shells was recovered. The agent responsible for preserving these shells in their unbroken condition is unknown.</page><page sequence="9">Canadian Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 15, 1991 81 No structural features were identified in the shell mound west of the ravine, but in 1946 two probable post moulds were recorded by Borden in Test Pit 4. Described by Borden (n.d.) as "curious circular holes" filled with brown soil, both features were about 50cm deep by 60cm in diameter. They were located 2.5 metres apart. According to Borden, both features tapered slightly downward, extended into the subsoil, and were rounded at the bottoms. A few cobbles were recovered from the base of one of these features. Borden made no suggestion as to the function of these "curious holes," but it seems most likely that they are the remains of large posts, possibly associated with a house or other large wooden structure. Human Remains No human remains were recovered in 1986 or 1988. However, in 1946 human remains were recovered by Borden from three different areas of the site. Near the south end of Borden's Trench I, enmeshed in roots, were the remains of a burial, described by Borden (n.d. 13-14) as follows: The bones were badly decayed, many of them crumbling on touch. Most of the vertebra and ribs, the sternum and nearly the entire pelvis had disin- tegrated. The leg and arm bones were somewhat better preserved, but there was not a trace of the skull, not even a tooth. From the arrangement of the bones it appears that the body had been laid on its left side, in a flexed position, facing south. About two- thirds of the skeleton rested under a shallow layer of compact and ap- parently undisturbed shell. The remainder was imbedded in a loose mixture of shell and humus, suggest- ing disturbance. Since this mixture prevailed also where the skull would normally have been, it is not possible to say whether the body was interred without the head, or whether the latter was removed subsequently. The remains seem to be those of an old man. Deformations on some of the bone joints suggest that he was suffer- ing from arthritis. In addition to the burial, Borden recovered two human limbs. Trench II in the shell mound yielded the upper part of a femur. From the surface of the ground, 3 metres west of Test Pit 4, a humérus was recovered. This bone was highly polished, and a series of lateral cut marks were visible across its mid- section (Figure 7). Artifacts A total of 391 flaked, ground, and peck- ed stone, bone, antler, and shell tools were recovered from the Point Grey site between Figure 7 Polished human humérus from the Point Grey site.</page><page sequence="10">82 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 Table 1 Artifacts from the Point Grey site or- ganized by activity tool kit. 1946 and 1988. The assemblage is diversified and reflects the performance of a variety of activities at the site (Table 1 ; Figures 8, 9, 10, 1 1). Hunting Sea mammal, land mammal, and possibly bird hunting gear are represented by unilaterally barbed bone harpoons (2), and points (15), large unbarbed bone points (19), chipped basalt projectile points (6), and a ground slate point (1). The bone harpoons, most commonly associated with sea mammal hunting, are of the "non-composite" Marpole style with bilateral line guards. Similar forms have been recovered from many Marpole components, and are generally thought to be a Marpole diagnostic (Mitchell 1971:52; Burley 1980:25). The flaked basalt points include contracting stem and triangular straight base varieties, both of which are common Marpole forms (Mitchell 1971 :52; Burley 1980:19- 20), and a small leaf-shaped point, which Burley (1980:19) states is rare for Marpole assemblages.</page><page sequence="11">Canadian Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 15, 1991 83 Figure 8 Selected ground and flaked stone tools from the Point Grey site. Fishing In addition to the barbed bone points, fishing gear is represented by perforated stones (22), and by small slender unipoints and bipoints (8). Two distinctly different fishing techniques are reflected here. The perforated stones were probably net weights, while the bone points may have been gorges for fish hooks. The perforated stones come in two distinct sizes (see Figure 9). Small perforated stones (1 8) range in weight from 28.9-64.2 grams. Their hole sizes are consistently less than 1 cm diameter, and in ten cases less than 5 mm diameter, so they must have been used in conjunction with finely twined nets. Four large perforated stones, ranging in weight from 489.1-629.0 grams, were also recovered. Mitchell (1971 : 160-61) suggests that large perforated stones may have been used as canoe anchors or as weights for large nets. At about 0.5kg each, it seems unlikely that the four stones from the Point Grey site were large enough to anchor a canoe. If they were, indeed, net sinkers then the obvious size distinction between small and large perforated stones may be as- sociated with two distinct types of netting technology. Processing and Food Preparation A variety of types of tools may have been used to process raw materials and prepare food. Chipped bifaces (12) include leaf-shaped and asymmetrical forms and</page><page sequence="12">84 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 Figure 9 Large and small per- forated stones from the Point Grey site. one "backed" biface. All have acute flaked edges of less than 45°, and were probably used as cutting tools. Ground slate knives (19) and one bone knife were also cutting tools, probably associated with fish processing (see Mitchell 1971:52; Hanson 1973:273). Unformed unifacial flake edge tools (63) and core/choppers (49) were probably multi-purpose tools used in a variety of processing tasks. Manufacturing A large, diversified manufacturing tool kit was recovered from the Point Grey site. Bone awls (22) and heavy-duty ulna tools (4) were probably multi-purpose implements. Bone needles (2) and drills (3) reflect sewing and perhaps leather-working. Ham- merstones (1 4) and anvils (6) attest to the manufacture of flaked lithic tools, while stone abraders (34) were probably used in the manufacture of groundstone, bone and antler tools. Woodworking A limited woodworking tool kit was recovered from the Point Grey site, including antler wedges (20) and small celts (9). Hammerstones may have been used in conjunc- tion with wedges to split planks, but spooled hand mauls were not recovered. Borden (1968, 1970) argued that the combination of antler wedges, hand mauls, and large celts was first seen during Marpole times, and represented the beginnings of heavy-duty woodworking, including large plank house construction. That tool kit is only partially represented at the Point Grey site. Planks and boards were evidently split and finished at the Point Grey site, but whether this was done in association with house construction is unknown. Ritual In addition to the human skeletal remains, three stone bowls and a stone mortar recovered from the Point Grey site suggest the performance of ritual activities. The stone bowls are part of the Marpole ceremonial complex of stone sculpture that includes seated human figure bowls, sculptured heads, and other anthropomorphic and zoomor-</page><page sequence="13">Canadian Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 15, 1991 85 Figure 10 Anthropomorphic stone bowl from the Point Grey site. phic effigies (Buriey 1980:24). Of the three stone bowls from the Point Grey site, only one is finished (Figure 10). Roughly ovoid in shape and weighing 3.4kg, this bowl is decorated at one end with the representation of a human face, including two circular eyes, a nose, and a mouth. The other two bowls are unfinished, their central depressions having been partly but not completely formed. Evidently, not only were rituals involving the use of anthropomorphic stone bowls performed at the Point Grey site, but manufac- turing of these ceremonial items was also done there. Personal Adornment Various items of personal adornment, which may also have been used in a ceremonial context, were recovered from the Point Grey site. The collection includes dental ia shell beads (7), and disk beads manufactured from slate (2) and shell (2), bone pendents (4), a drilled canine, and a ribbed sandstone piece. Dentalia is often thought to be a wealth item (Buriey 1980:23), since it does not occur naturally in the Marpole area, and since it is often found in burial contexts. Its presence at the Point Grey site suggests that display of wealth was an important social activity at the site. Faunal Remains Analyses of faunal remains from the Point Grey site have been performed on unit samples and column samples from Trench A (Chatan 1987; Coupland and Unfreed 1988; Fredericks 1989; Wigen 1989; Unfreed 1989). In addition, Unfreed (1989) has examined faunal material recoverd by Borden in 1 946. A variety of measurements of abundance were taken, including NISP, MNI, and bone weight. Mollusca A total of 14 species of mollusca were identified by Unfreed (Coupland and Unfreed 1988:100; Unfreed 1989:48) in her analysis of remains from Trench A. Most taxa, including clams, cockles, whelks, mussels, and barnacles, occurred frequently and were evenly distributed throughout the strata of Trench A.</page><page sequence="14">86 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 Figure 11 Selected bone and antler tools from the Point Grey site. With the exception of the infrequently occurring weathervane scallop, whose preferred habitat is soft mud and sandy sea bottoms at depths of greater than ten fathoms (Quayle 1978:27), the marine mollusca from the Point Grey site are inter-tidal species representing two habitats: rocky foreshore, and protected beaches of sand, mud, and gravel (see Table 2). Although no quantitative measurements of abundance were attempted on mol- lusca, it was apparent during excavation that the species most important for subsistence was blue mussel (Mytilus edulis), followed distantly by littleneck (Protothaca staminea) and butter clams (Saxidomus giganteus), and basket cockle (Clinocardium nuttali). Fish Fish remains were clearly the most abundant of the bone elements recovered from the Point Grey site. Of the almost 60,000 bone fragments identified by Unfreed (1989:52) from Trench A, over 58,000 (97.5%) were from fish. The proportion of fish in the column sample was even higher; 99.8%. Pacific herring (Clupea harengus) was the most abundant fish taxon in both the unit samples and the column sample (see Table 3). In the unit sample, herring constitutes 80% of the remains by NISP, outnumbering flatfish elements by a ratio of 6.6:1 , and outnumbering salmon (Onchorynchus spp.) by 13.8:1. It is in the column sample, however, where the abundance of herring is best represented (see Table 4). Herring elements are very small. In the unit sample, the rate of recovery of herring was undoubtedly considerably less than that of the larger boned</page><page sequence="15">Canadian Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 15, 1991 87 Table 2 Mollusca recovered from Trench A.

The column sample was processed in the lab through a series of nested screens, which ensured 100 percent recovery of all taxa. In this sample herring constitutes 82% of the remains by NISP, but it outnumbers flatfish by a ratio of 36.5:1 , and outnumbers salmon by almost 100:1 . The main herring spawning grounds in the Gulf of Georgia area are in Boundary Bay near Roberts Bank, and in the Gulf Islands (Chapman and Turner 1956:50). Both of these locations are considerable distances from Point Grey. Closer to the site are herring spawning locations at Sturgeon Banks, and along the coast of Point Grey itself (Chapman and Turner 1956:50; Hart 1973:97). In fact, herring could be taken until recently near Jericho Beach, two kilometres east of the site. The Point Grey site occupants had good access to herring in close proximity to the site. The remainder of the fish at the Point Grey site are minimally represented, with the surprising exception of anchovy {Engraulis mordax), recovered from the column sample. In that sample, anchovy elements were second most numerous to herring, accounting for about 4% of the sample by weight. Anchovy was not identified at all in the unit samples, and has rarely, if ever, been identified in other Marpole faunal assemblages. Virtually all of the anchovy remains at Point Grey were recovered from layer Ρ of the column sample (Wigen 1 989) , which suggests that this fish may have been a "one-time-only" resource.</page><page sequence="16">88 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 TAXON UNIT SAMPLE7 COLUMN SAMPLE2 NISP MNI NISP BONE WEIGHT5 Pacific herring {Clupea Harengus) 37,374 ifi64 4,451 26.6 flatfish (Pleuronectidae) 5,756 214 122 4.7 salmon (Onchorynchus spp.) 2,738 31 45 1.5 spotted ratfish (Hydrolagus collet) 286 67 4 0.7 spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias) 236 3 7 0.1 sculpins (Cottidae) 134 9 31 0.1 sturgeon fflcipenser spp.) 55 1 1 0.2 rockfish (Sebastes spp.) 39 2 Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) 24 3 pile perch (Racochilus vacca) 22 1 1 0.1 sablefish fflnoplopoma fímbria) 8 2 plianfin midshipman (Porichthys notatus) 5 1 northern anchovy (Engraulis mordait) 643 1 .5 eulachon [Thaleichthys pacificus) 35 0.2 surf smelt (Hypomesus pretiosus) 89 0.2 Table 3 Fish remains from Trench A: (1) excavation units A1-A4, Unfreed n.d.; (2) column sample from A4, Wigen n.d.; (3) bone weight in grams. Birds and Mammals Bird and mammal remains were all but non-existent in the column sample (Wigen 1989). In the unit sample, bird remains represent 2.2 percent of the faunal assemblage; mammals, 0.3% (Unfreed 1989:66, 85). Birds are best represented by ducks (85.3% of identified birds) (Unfreed 1989:69), including dabbling and diving varieties (see Table 4). Occurring in the area in early spring and late fall, many of the ducks were likely taken in conjunction with herring (Unfreed 1989:213-23). Borden (n.d.) noted the paucity of mammal remains at the Point Grey site, and the almost complete absence of sea mammal remains. Our results from Trench A are in agreement with Borden's observa- tion. Yet, marine and land mammal hunting gear are present in the tool assemblage at the Point Grey site. Two possible explanations may account for this apparent discrepan- cy. Either mammals were hunted and processed away from the site, which would suggest logistical mobility using the Point Grey site as a base, or mammal bones entered the archaeological record in another part of the site.

The main contribution of this analysis is that it allows inference of the season of site occupation. Complete or nearly complete shells with undamaged outer edges are required so that an estimate of the season of procurement can be made by comparing the amount of growth in the final year to that of previous years. Whole, undamaged shells occurred very infrequently in the Point Grey site midden, but near the bottom of Trench A, a small sample of well preserved, largely unbroken clam shells was recovered in 1 988. This sample probably represents a single</page><page sequence="18">90 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 Figure 12 Annual growth increments of six shell samples from Trench A (from Tetrault 1989). episode of disposal. In this analysis, (Tetrault 1989) was only able to identify six shells (five littlenecks, one butter clam) that gave clear indications of season of procurement. For these shells final year growth ranged from 1 8-47% of the average of the previous years (Tetrault 1989:18) (Figure 12). Early spring to early summer procurement is indicated. An additional 18 shells (13 littlenecks, five butter clams) gave somewhat ambiguous readings (Tetrault 1989), but in general did not contradict the estimate of spring-early summer seasonality. Further evidence of late winter-early summer seasonality is provided by four of the fish taxa: herring, flatfish, eulachon (Thaleichthys pacificus), and anchovy. Herring, which are so abundant at the Point Grey site, are a good late winter-early spring indicator, at which time they spawn in dense schools close to shore in shallow water (Hart 1973:97). Many of the flatfish, especially starry flounder (Platichthys stellatus), probably reflect spring procurement, as they spawn in shallow water through March and April (Hart 1973:632). Eulachon, rare but present in the Point Grey site faunal assemblage, also spawn in spring, from mid-March to mid-May (Hart 1973:149). Finally, anchovy dwell offshore through winter, but move in close to shore in spring, and spawn in early summer (Hart 1973:104-05). THE POINT GREY SITE AND MARPOLE SETTLEMENT PATTERNS From the foregoing evidence, the Point Grey site may best be interpreted as a Marpole period "spring village." Seasonality evidence suggests that the site was occupied from late winter to early summer, a substantial portion of the year. Marpole people probably timed their arrival at the Point Grey site to coincide with the herring runs beginning in late winter, then remained at the site through the spring, fishing for flatfish, and gathering shellfish. There is no evidence of late fall-winter occupation of the Point Grey site. The shellfish seasonality evidence does not indicate use of the site at this time of year. Nor are the proportions of the main taxa consistent with a model of late fall-winter occupa- tion. If the Point Grey site was a winter village, a higher proportion of salmon might be</page><page sequence="19">Canadian Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 15, 1991 91 expected in the fish assemblage. For example, Matson et al. (1980) demonstrated Marpole winter village occupation at the Beach Grove site in Tsawwassen, where salmon (32% of fish remains by weight) and flatfish (39.2%) were considerably more abundant than herring (18.6%) (Matson et al. 1980:73-74). This situation is the reverse of what was found at the Point Grey site. More specifically, since salmon represents a stored resource in winter, a high ratio of post-cranial to cranial elements might be expected. In fact, salmon is not overly abundant at the Point Grey site, and Unfreed (1989:63) has shown that salmon cranial and post-cranial elements from Trench A are about equally represented when measured by MNI. She concludes that salmon "entered the depositional environment of Trench A in a reasonably whole state" (Unfreed 1 989:64). This suggests that salmon were caught, perhaps as they preyed upon herring, and processed at the site. While herring was the principle resource at Point Grey, the site was clearly not just a specialized herring fishing camp. A number of lines of evidence suggest that the site functioned as a village or long-term habitation. First, the artifact assemblage includes a variety of tool kits reflecting different activities. Large, diversified assemblages are more commonly associated with long-term habitation sites than with short-term, specialized, resource extraction sites (Binford 1980). Second, the tool assemblage is "coarse-grained,", another characteristic of long term habitation sites (Binford 1980). While hunting tool kits for land and sea mammals were both present at the Point Grey site, the faunal remains of these animals were minimal. This may reflect the vagaries of sampling, but I think a more likely explanation is that people moved logistically from the Point Grey site to temporary camps to hunt land and sea mammals. For example, harbour seals, the most common sea mammal in the Fraser delta area, are more likely to be found south of the delta near Boundary Bay than around Point Grey (Hoos and Packman 1974:12; Unfreed 1989:215). Third, some of the material remains at the Point Grey site, including stone bowls and modified human remains, were probably associated with the performance of ceremony or ritual. Ceremonial activities, including human interment, are more likely to have been performed at residential sites than at short-term specialized camps. In addition, the 3 pecked stone bowls from the Point Grey site were recovered in various stages of manufacture. Not only were these items used at the Point Grey site, they were also made there. The manufacture of stone bowls requires substantial time and energy, more than is likely to be available if people were engaged only in short-term, intensive resource extraction. There is no direct evidence of large, permanent plank houses at the Point Grey site, but the two soil-filled circular holes identified by Borden in Test Pit 4 are almost certainly post moulds, and they are of a size that is consistent with the large posts used in house construction. One might argue that two post moulds do not constitute strong evidence for house construction. The problem here is that the part of the site which would have been most suitable for house construction - on top of the bluff overlooking the entrance to English Bay - is the area that has been so badly disturbed over the years. We now have little idea what was there. The two large post moulds offer a tantalizing clue, and in excavating Test Pit 4 and nearby Test Pit 7, Borden observed extremely compact layers of crushed shell, as one might expect from a well-trampled house floor (see Suttles 1974:257-58; Ham 1982:182). Measuring over 200 metres long by 80 metres wide, the Point Grey site has a reliable source of fresh water, and is high and dry with an excellent view of Howe Sound and the Gulf of Georgia. These site location features are most typically associated with</page><page sequence="20">92 Journal canadien d'archéologie, Vol. 15, 1990 large villages. It is difficult to imagine a single component, specialized activity camp this big and with this much assemblage diversity. OTHER MARPOLE SPRING VILLAGES? If the Point Grey site was a spring village, was it unique among Marpole sites? Ham (1982:355-58) and Monks (1977; 1987) have argued that intensive herring fishing may have originated during early Marpole times (pa. 2400-2000 BP) as part of a larger annual pattern of resource intensification that included salmon fishing in summer and fall. Prominent herring fishing locations would be good places to look for evidence of spring villages. The Deep Bay site (DiSe-7) (Monks 1977; 1987) on east Vancouver Island provides good evidence of late winter-spring occupation associated with intensive herring fishing as well as procurement of other aquatic resources that preyed on herring. Certainly, intensive spring production was possible at Deep Bay. Like the Point Grey site, Deep Bay is a large site with a permanent source of fresh water. Permanent house remains have not been recorded at Deep Bay, but a large stone fish trap representing a substantial labour investment, and a fortification were part of the site. These features suggest that Deep Bay was more than just a short-term camp. However, Deep Bay has Locarno Beach and Gulf of Georgia cultural components in addition to the Marpole component, and it is not clear who built the fish trap or the fortification. They could pre-date or post-date the Marpole occupation. In addition, the shellfish seasonally evidence indicated mainly late winter-early spring procurement during the Marpole period (Monks 1977:290), which suggests that people were only at Deep Bay for the duration of the herring run. Elsewhere, Ham (1982:355) has postulated that the Marpole component of the Whalen Farm site may also have been associated with intensive herring fishing and spring occupation. Whalen Farm is a very large site with deep midden deposits - almost certainly a village - but the suggestion of intensive herring fishing and spring occupation requires further testing. At present then, the Point Grey site does appear to be unique among Marpole components, in that it was a late-winter to early summer occupation with many features commonly associated with a village. But I do not think that the Point Grey site will remain unique for long. I agree with Ham and Monks, that as west coast archaeologists become more aware of the importance of abundant, localized spring resources like herring and eulachon, and as they adjust their field recovery techniques to account for the small bone elements of those species, more Marpole spring village components will be identified in the future. CONCLUSIONS The emergence of ascribed social inequality and large permanent villages during Marpole times appears to have been closely associated with the intensification of resource production. But as Monks (1987) has noted, some west coast archaeologists have tended to over-emphasize the importance of salmon as the single intensified resource. As prominent as salmon was, it was not available year round, nor did it sustain Marpole populations for the entire year. If the Marpole change to social inequality, sedentism, and intensification was a "total" change, in the sense suggested by Flannery, then it would have involved a year round economic and social commitment. Herring and the various species that prey an herring (Monks 1987) would then form an intensive</page><page sequence="21">Canadian Journal of Archaeology, Vol. 15, 1991 93 resource complex that would allow the strategy of intensive resource production and permanent settlement to continue during spring, when salmon was not available. Undoubtedly not all Marpole local groups had access to productive herring fishing locations, and not all herring fishing locations were spring villages. In some cases, winter villages may have been located close to the spawning beds to permit logistical mobility without change of residence. But in other cases, a change of residence may have been necessary, as people moved from winter villages to spring villages, like the Point Grey site.

ABSTRACT The complex hunter-gatherers of the Northwest Coast of North America were renowned for their permanent village way of life. Many groups maintained winter villages and summer-fall villages, the latter associated with intensive salmon production. Settle- ment patterns in spring were quite varied. Some groups were dispersed and mobile, while others maintained a village way of life based on intensive production of critical spring resources. The Point Grey site is interpreted as a spring village component of the Marpole culture at which herring was the key resource produced. Technological, faunal and human skeletal evidence are presented to support this inference of site seasonality and function. RESUME Les chasseurs-cueilleurs complexes de la côte nord-ouest du Pacifique étaient renommés pour leur mode de vie villageoise. Plusieurs groupes avaient à la fois des villages d'hiver et des villages d'été-automne, ces derniers étant liés à la production intensive du sauman. Le scheme d'établissement était plus vraiable au printemps et, si certains groupes devenaient mobiles ou se dispersaient, d'autres conservaient leurs habitudes villageoises en se rivant à la production intensive d'une ressource saisonnière alors abondante. Le site Point Grey serait un village printanier de la culture Marpole, installé à un lieu majeur de capture du hareng. Cette interprétation semble appuyée par des données technologiques, par des études de la faune et par certains attributs des squelettes humains.</page></plain_text>
