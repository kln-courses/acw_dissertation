Billeskov Jansen, Danmarks Digtekunst, vols 1-3, Munks gaard, 241, 261, and 433 pp. A photographic reprint of an extremely important work (originally publ. in 1944-58), in which an attempt is made to base a historical account on aesthetic factors, such as motifs, techniques, etc. Vols 1-3 cover Danish lit. from runic inscriptions to the so-called 'breakthrough'; a fourth vol., in preparation, will bring the work up to the present day. Unlike the original ed. the new one is indexed. Mario Gabrieli, Le letterature delta Scandinavia. Danese, Nor vegese, Svedese, Islandese, Florence, Sansoni, Milan, Accademia, 450 pp., a revd and augmented ed. of a survey originally publ. in 1958. Unfortunately the book is rather badly proportioned: Strindberg has 42 pp., H. C. Andersen 5 pp., Tom Kristensen 5 lines, ? and Tl romanticismo' 25 pp. There are many misprints and too many factual errors (Oehlenschlager's 'Aladdin' is, e.g., dated 1820, instead of 1805). Bibl. refs are provided, and an Tndice analitico'. In 1964 Hanne Marie and Werner Svendsen publ. a 'Geschichte der danischen Literatur' (cf. YWML, 26:572). It was severely criticized, e.g., by Erik Lunding (JEGP, 65, 1966: 355-62), and Hans Kuhn, Euph, 63: 227-43 is even severer. Some other revs are listed in OZ,, 21,1966: 121 (note 1). * The place of publication is Copenhagen, unless otherwise stated.</page><page sequence="2">646 Danish Studies reference works Folmer Christensen, ass. Lotte Eskelund, Litteraturleksikon, Gjellerup, 300 pp., contains about 2,000 definitions and about 500 pseudonyms. The work is useful but does not come up to the standard of, e.g., Gero von Wilpert's 'Sachworterbuch der Literatur'. texts Lennart Breitholtz (ed.), Dansk diktning (Litteraturens klassiker i urval, 13), Stockholm, Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, 1968, 260 pp., is a verse anthology intended for Swedish univ. students. It includes the first act of Oehlenschlager's 'Aladdin5, and modern poetry is given reasonable space. An 'ordlista5 by Leif Leifer concludes the anthology. literary criticism New Criticism did not achieve a dominant position in Danish interpretative practice until about i960; since then the book market has not suffered from any shortage of works devoted to close-reading of individual poems. A rising curve of awareness of the theoretical and methodological problems involved in the interpretative process may be traced through these works, most of which have aimed at demonstrating a single method or point of view. Thomas Bredsdorff (ed.), Danske digtanalyser, Fredens borg, Arena, 192 pp., aims at demonstrating nearly as many methods and points of view as it has contributors ? it is, among other things, intended as a 'provekollektion5. Unlike many of its predecessors (which have reflected the assumption that the approach and basic conceptions of New Criticism are methodologically bound up with the structure of modern poetry) this coll. seeks to test the validity of the different critical approaches to poetry in general, from medieval ballads to post-war poems. But according to the pref. the book is also meant as a sort of epitaph: close-reading has been a mani festation of a necessary settling of accounts with historico biog. methods and approaches ? now it seems as if interest is once again turning towards wider contexts (e.g., those offered by the history of ideas) as frames of reference for interpretative efforts. The contributions ? except Jens Kruuse5s art. on J. S. Welhaven5s 'Champs Elysees5, 111-21 ? are listed below under the writers in question (abbrev. Da. digtanal.). Two other books of criticism may be said to represent the</page><page sequence="3">Literature 647 'Ausklang' of the genre described by Th. Bredsdorff. They both contain arts previously publ. in newspapers, etc., i.e., they address themselves to a different audience than most other books of this kind. Steffen Hejlskov Larsen, Sproget som et billede af Danmark, Borgen, 179 pp., depicts the hollowness of certain lit. conventions and modes, e.g., 'den folkelige sang5, and demonstrates the qualities of the so-called 'systemdigtning'. Vagn Steen, Lasninger, Borgen, 187 pp., comprises a ser. of 'readings' of individual texts, as well as, e.g., a paper read by the author at the Sixth I ASS Conference, Uppsala, 1964 (on the relations between poetry and (other) visual arts). Steffen Hejlskov Larsen, Om at l&lt;ese moderne poesi, Borgen, 176 pp., originally publ. 1965, YWML, 27: 513-14. Also to be mentioned: Jorgen Bang, 'Lit.-kritikkens perspek tiv', Poe, 2nd ser., 2: 39-43, and Finn Stein Larsen, 'Talent og moral', KritC, 10: 5-20. LITERARY THEORY As is known, New Criticism established a structural principle to be applied in lit. scholarship ? but without providing any generally accepted definition of the concept of structure in lit. contexts. In search of something to put into the principle theorists have turned to structural linguistics, esp. towards semantic theories. Per Aage Brandt has discussed the subject of Tiktivitet og semiologi', Poe, 2nd ser., 2: 44-59, transl. A. J. Greimas's 'Grundtraek af en narrativ grammatik', ib., 3: 1-20, and, in collaboration with Jorgen Monster Pedersen, written some 'Narratologiske noter', ib.y 3: 22-37. Peter Madsen, 'Strukturel semantik', KritC, 11: 99-118, is a sympathetic and competent presentation of Greimas's canonical book, 'Seman tique structurale'. The same vol. of KritC included two other arts on French critics. Nils Lykke Knudsen, 'Det kosmiserede jeg', 85-98, is devoted to Gaston Bachelard's phenomenological poetics, and Esbern Krause-Jensen, 'Struktur, subjekt og lit.', 119-35, discusses Roland Barthes's criticism and the crit. glosses made to it by, e.g., Paul Ricoeur; the author is of the opinion that the subject/structure antinomy may be dissolved and replaced by a new and more fertile 'correlative' juxtaposition of concepts. In its ser. of introd. arts KritC has also included an essay by Bertel Pedersen, 'Northrop Frye. Mod en kritik uden vaegge',</page><page sequence="4">648 Danish Studies 9: 52-73. Thus the Anglo-American orientation of Danish lit. criticism is not completely overlooked. The subject of the conference held in January 1968 (cf. YWML, 30: 605) was debated again in the summer of 1969 ? from other positions and with not quite the same combatants. Aage Henriksen, who may be said to represent a group of lit. critics rooted in a classical Danish tradition, but prepared to question the application of traditional concepts to the humani ties, reported on the conference in KritC, 12: 108-24. Mogens Loj and Niels Erik Wille, who represented a group of more revolutionary-minded linguists, were not, however, able to recognize themselves in H.'s mirror, so they gave their own points of view (and identified their efforts with Gerard Rad nitzky's attempts at synthesizing Anglo-Saxon analytical philosophy and Continental hermeneutic-dialectical thinking) in KritC, 13, 1970: 120-35. A few 'social-revolutionaere studen ter5, who took part in the conference, had their viewpoints publ. together with Henriksen's report (Bo Hakon Jorgensen, 'Revolution og tradition', KritC, 12: 125-31). Povl Schmidt, 'Ontologi, digtning og kritik', KritC, 12: 60-75, discusses some aspects of Per Hojholt's poetics (cf. TWML, 29: 550), i.a., with ref. to 'det vaerensfilosofiske lit.-studium', which is said to be in need of having its concept of attitude defined. Jorn Vosmar attempts to meet this criticism in 'Vaerkets verden, vaerkets holdning', ib., 12: 76-107, where he disposes of trends represented in Danish lit. criticism by Hans Jorgen Schiodt, Finn Brandt-Pedersen, and Steffen Hejlskov Larsen. V.'s alternative is a description of what Brooks calls the 'total and governing attitude' of the text(s), a description orientated towards the ontological structures (or existentials): time, space, world, ego. According to the art. these are equivalents to the so-called semantic universals (so that an interpretation based on the existentials has an immanent semantic correlative). Aarestrup's poem 'Paa Sneen' is used by way of exemplification. Cf. Niels Egebak, Aarhuus Stiftstidende, 27 November, who main tains that the 'linguistic' approaches are not to be blamed an sich, and that a more serious preoccupation with the pheno menological philosophy of language and aesthetics, and with a semantics inspired by phenomenology, may help structuralism to get rid of its growing pains.</page><page sequence="5">Literature 649 Helge Hultberg, Semantisk litter aturbetragtning, Munksgaard, 164 pp., originally publ. in 1966 (cf. YWML, 28: 572), has been re-issued with a few minor alterations. The book has initiated some debate, esp. in Norway. Three contributions are reprinted in: Sigmund Hoftun and Rolf Tobiassen (eds), Mat og metoder i litteraturforskningen, Oslo, Gyldendal Norsk Forlag, 167-82. children's literature It is beyond doubt that interest in children's lit. has seen a considerable increase during recent years. Research is now carried out from several points of view: psychological, pedagogi cal, sociological, historical, and aesthetical. Gudrun Paaske (ed.), Bernenes hvem skrev hvad, Politiken, 384 pp., is a much needed ref. work. It comprises about 500 biogs of Danish as well as non-Danish writers of children's books and about 400 resumes of plots. Vibeke Stybe, Fra Askepot til Anders And. Bernebogen i kultur historisk perspektiv, Munksgaard, 1970, 210 pp. This revd and enlarged ed. of a work originally publ. in 1962 surveys the history of European (and American) children's lit. from its birth during the Enlightenment to the middle of the 20th c, which latter part she calls 'barnets arhundrede' ? from the famous book by Ellen Key. Id. (ed.), Bernespejl.

Sven Moller Kristensen and Preben Ramlov (eds), Berne- og ungdomsbeger. Problemer og analyser, Gyldendal, 284 pp. The first section of this extensive, but somewhat diffuse composite work is devoted to the discussion of different aspects of child ren's lit., i.a. moral conceptions, social attitudes, linguistic characteristics, and artistic qualities. The second section con tains a ser. of interpretations, i.a. by Ramlov, who discusses Tom Kristensen's 'Bokserdrengen', 1925. The third section includes a survey by Marie Svendsen of some main currents in Danish 20th-c. children's lit. This contribution (250-71) may be read as a continuation of Inger Simonsen's valuable study Den danske bornebog i det 19. aarhundrede, originally publ. in</page><page sequence="6">650 Danish Studies 1942, photographically reprinted in 1966 (Nyt Nordisk Forlag, 300 pp., 8 pis). metrics Poul Borum, 'Meningsmetrik', KritC, 9: 20-51, discusses four poems (Claussen's 'Verbena', Bull's 'Fantasi', Brorson's 'En Kiempe-Vise om Goliath og David', and the author's own 'Pageant') in order to form the basis of a metrical approach that is 'totalt meningsrettet'. The art. may be regarded as an attempt to establish an alternative to Arthur Arnholtz's theories, well-known, e.g., from Dansk Versl&amp;re, vol. 1: Historie og teori (mentioned, but not commented on in YWML, 28: 573), which B. rev. in KritC, 2, 1967: 80-100: 'Handkantslag eller retorisk plan?'. This art. prompted a reply from Jorgen Fafner (whose diss. for the doctorate, Strofer og strofebygning (see TWML, 26: 572-3), represented institutionalized trends) in KritC, 3, 1967:81-98.

The Middle Ages Ernst Frandsen, Folkevisen. Studier i middelalderens poetiske lit., Gyldendal, 168 pp. This important ? and much criticized ? study, originally publ. in 1935, asserts that Germany played a more significant part than England in the transmission of the ballad genre from France to Scandinavia. The author compares the formulaic inventory of the ballads with that of the novels of chivalry, i.e. the Swedish 'eufemiaviser', esp. the transl. (1303) of Chretien's 'Le chevalier au lion', and postulates the existence of an East Scandinavian 'minnesang'. He also characterizes three stages in the early history of the ballads, considers the four-line stanza to be an extension of the two-line stanza, and rejects the so-called 'stevstammeteori'. F.'s periodization is almost exclusively based on the ballads of magic (in DgF, vol. 2). This is also true of Villy Sorensen's. His essay on 'Folkeviser og forlovelser' (in Digtere og d&lt;emoner, 1959) has been of great importance esp. to the youngest generation of Danish critics, because it aims at understanding</page><page sequence="9">Literature 653 the ballads as interpretations of human existence, not at describing them as historical relics. Flemming Harrits, Tolke viseproblemer ? med saerligt henblik pa Villy Sorensen', KritC, 10: 27-51, professes agreement as to the basic concep tion that 'en folkevisedaemon er et sindbillede' (i.e. a projection, or symbol ? but not an anthropomorphic natural force). S. has, however, used 'reconstructed' texts in addition to the DgF material. His interpretations are also marked by cen vis reduktiv Freudiansk tilbojelighed'. And his assertion that some ballads of chivalry have features in common with the ballads of magic is due to a misunderstanding of their realistic features. Towards the end of his essay H. introduces an alternative to the traditional view of the process of formation of the ballads. Every period is shaped by residual elements from several previous periods. Two ballads representing different attitudes may, therefore, be the products of different residual elements present in one period, rather than the products of different periods. Peer E. Sorensen, 'Et episk monster i folkevisen', KritC, 9: 5-19, attempts to replace the well-known systematization of the ballads according to external criteria by a new one based on internal criteria. The author analyses a ser. of ballads and isolates a structure ('eksposition'/'overgangssituation'/'konsekvens') that may be called archetypal. Johannes C. H. R. Steenstrup, The Medieval Popular Ballad, transl. Edward Godfrey Cox, Seattle and London, Washington U.P., 1968, xxxii + 269 pp., was originally publ. in 1914 from the Danish original of 1891, and represents an early era of Danish ballad research. S. is esp. interested in the historical ballads and maintains that the main task is to Tremskaffe den aegte aeldste Form'. This new ed. contains a foreword by David C. Fowler and a bibl. essay by Karl-Ivar Hildeman. lorn Pio, 'Overnaturlige vaesner i nordisk balladetradition, T, DSt, 48-71, examines DgF 33, 'Germand Gladensvend', and DgF 60, 'Valravnen', from a folkloristic point of view. P. wants to determine what kind of demon the heroes of these two ballads are confronted with. The answer is: a human being transformed into a raven, who must drink boy-child blood in order to get out of the bewitched state.

The bulk of the vol. is concerned with secular poetry. A 2nd vol. (introd., comms, etc.) is in preparation. Revs of Wilhelm Friese's Nordische Barockdichtung (cf.

Det teatervidenskabelige Institut, contains five studies. Karen Krogh's contribution, 9-51, is devoted to a discussion of Giuseppe Sarti's efforts to reform the Danish as well as the Russian theatre. Sarti composed the music to Niels Krog Bredal's 'Gram og Signe', the first opera in the Danish language,</page><page sequence="11">Literature 655 and the first dramatic work to make use of a theme from Scan dinavian antiquity. Henrik Neiiendam's contribution, 72-80, is concerned with a curious testimony of the unbroken Holberg tradition of the Royal Theatre, namely the Jeppe costume used by Marcus Ulsoe Hortulan ? and still by Oswald Helmuth a few years ago. Neiiendam has also contributed two other arts on i8th-c. Danish theatre history: 'To anonyme teaterskrifter fra det 18. arhundrede', Kulturminder, ny rk., 6: 165-82, and 'Unbekannte Bildquellen zum Theater Holbergs und der franzosischen Opera comique', MuK, 15: 22-8. BAGGESEN L. L. Albertsen, Odins mjod. En studie i B.s mytiske poetik, Arhus, Akad. Boghandel, 106 pp. The thesis of this stimulating study is that B.'s writings constitute a coherent representation of a scrupulously developed panektheistic philosophy, centred round the mythic equivalent of this philosophy: the narrative about Odin and Suttung's mead in Snorre's 'Edda'. A.'s book may be considered a complement to Aage Henriksen's important study, Den Rejsende, 1961. B.'s cycle of poems to Nanna, 'Balders Igenkomst', 1816-17, is given a bad mark fdognpoesi') by A. ? but not in Steffen Hejlskov Larsen's interpretation of the cycle, in Da. digtanal., 59-76. Here the poems are looked upon as attempts to solve existential prob lems in the poetic language, i.e. as 'lyriske tilvaerelsesmodeller' (cf. YWML, 30: 604-5). Hejlskov L.'s approach is, by the way, in line with the point of view expressed by Albertsen in a contribution ('als eine Materialsammlung zu verstehen') publ. just before Odins mjed, that 'nicht die Welt, sondern vielmehr das Wort' gave B. his inspirations ('Das vorgeformte Wort. B. als Ubersetzer und Parodist', Nerthus, 2: 151-85). BIEHL Charlotte Dorothea B., Pigeopdragelse, ed. and introd. Pil Dahlerup, Hasselbalch, 88 pp., elucidates the conflict between authoritative upbringing and incipient self-confidence in the rather unessential writings of a woman of letters whose fame is due to the fact that she translated 'Don Quijote' (1776-7).

It comprises all E.'s extant work: printed and unprinted, finished and unfinished, letters, drafts, etc. ? as well as variant notes, a description of MS. material, and a bibl. A planned dictionary was rendered superfluous by 'Ordbog over det danske Sprog', the publ. of which started in 1918; the words 'Ordbog ved H. Juul-Jensen', on the title pages of vols 1-3, may be read as an epitaph over that part of the original project. An iconography, a bibl. of secondary lit., a crit. comm., and an index were planned, too, but given up. The publ. works (as well as unpubl. preserved in fair copies) are ed. V. Kuhr; H. Brix's name is mentioned, too, on the title pages of the first vols, and according to the pref. his efforts are 'knyttet til Manuskriptudgivelsen'; but the vols containing the letters, drafts and variant notes are ed.

Jens Aage Doctor, Gyldendal, 231 pp. This ed. of E.'s famous autobiog. is intended for students. It provides a postscript surveying the history of the genre and characterizing the work along the same lines as in D.'s contribution to Guldalderstudier, 1966 (cf. TWML, 28: 573-4) Flemming Lundgreen-Nielsen, 6Mulm og Skraek og Kamp og Dod. Johs. E.'s "Rolf Krage" ', DSt, 5-19, emphasizes the fact that E.'s prose tragedy is the only 'Nordic' work in i8th-c. Danish lit., in which the heroic attitude suppresses the senti mental attitude. In this way 'Rolf Krage' anticipated Schiller's and Oehlenschlager's tragic idealism. In his contribution to Da. digtanal., 49-58, Thomas Breds dorff interprets the poem 'Da jeg var syg' in the light of the history of ideas, as a testimony of a germinating Romantic individualism.

Studier i dansk romankunst 1870-1900, Gyldendal, 413 pp., is a photographically reprinted ed. of an extremely important examination (origin ally publ. in 1961) of T.'s impact on the Danish lit. of the so-called Naturalist period. The Russian novelist was introd. by Vilh. Moller. His realism (accurate descriptions, psychological motivations, detailed analyses of characters) satisfied the younger generation of writers far more than the plain naturalism of his French colleagues. His 'superfluous' heroes served as points of identification. And his style (sensitive impressionism, indirect characterization, the 'central' per spective) marked out new ways. Fjord Jensen's study is based on a more satisfactory conception of lit. influence than most other works belonging to this genre; he does not hunt in fluences, and he does not confuse influences with similarities. Carl Stief (rev., Vindrosen, 9, 1962:591-4) characterized the book as one of the most remarkable contributions to lit. history for several years.

H., himself a painter and litho graphic artist, emphasizes that A. rebelled against the 'formal' art produced by his contemps; his efforts to be considered a 'Skizzemager' was not an excuse for being an amateur, but an attempt to avoid criticism. The present book demands attention as the first evaluation to deal with all aspects of A.'s visual art. It is, however, too enthusiastic to be considered a definitive treatment. Moreover, A.'s production is rather extensive: about 70 pencil drawings, 250 pen drawings, 1,500 cuttings and collages. Rev.

'Haablose Slaegter', publ. in 1880, but confiscated because of some 'immoral' passages, was republ. in a 'revised' ed. in 1884 and in a 'definitive' ed. in 1905. The first reprint of the original version appeared in 1965. In his introd. Villy Sorensen em phasized the symbolic character of the novel ? while Harry Andersen (B.'s biographer, cf. TWML, 28:576-7) and Koskimies tend to read it as a masked autobiog. Jorgen E. Tiemroth, 'Omkring "Haablose Slaegter"', KritC, 12:5-14, aims at correcting Villy Sorensen: B.'s novel does not settle with a dead tradition that restrains the individual, but with the impossible aspiring of the individual beyond the given limits of the self; paradoxically William Hog loses his freedom at the very moment he escapes from his own self.

FABER Erik M. Christensen, En fortolkning af 'Heit fra Traets grenne Top\ Verifikationsproblemet ved lit.-videnskabelig meningsanalyse belyst i praksis, Gyldendal, 152 pp. This stimulating work aims at elucidating the intricate problem of verification in lit. scholarship, or in any case at establishing an appropriate basis for further discussion. The questions to be answered are: is it possible to produce a 'true' interpretation ? and: what does it mean to say that an interpretation is 'true' ? The present book is devoted to the 'practical' aspects of the process of answering; a not very much discussed (and seemingly unproblematic) text, a Christmas song by Peter F., is interpreted, and the interpretation is measured against the 'environments' of the text, i.a. the 'period'. C. is of the opinion that the establishing of 'periods' in lit. history should aim at describing the historical contexts of the works in terms of the history of ideas (cf. his own term 'meningsanalyse'). Such a description is, however, not the finis finalis of lit. scholarship. It must be seen as part of a complicated dialectic where the 'period' functions both as a mobile hypothesis and as a fixed unit of measure. In</page><page sequence="20">664 Danish Studies the present work this operation leads to an enriched definition of the concept of 'optimistisk dualisme' (introduced as a period-term by Christensen in 1966, cf.

Sammenligning og vurdering, Nyt Nordisk Forlag, 224 pp. The method of this ambitious and personally engaged comparison of the most influential personalities of igth-c. Danish cultural life is existential-phenomenological, not biog.-historical. While pre vious studies have emphasized the distance between Kierke gaard and G., Toftdahl emphasizes the essential common feature: both opposed the mixture of idealistic philosophy and Christian theology of their Romantic age, and both did so from a Christian point of view. This book sees G. through Kierkegaard's spectacles. But it also criticizes the philosopher, because he removed the individual from the human context and isolated him. The title of T.'s study alludes to the famous formula of G.'s humanism, or anthropology: 'Menneske forst ? og Kristen saa'. This programme was to some extent worked out on the basis of the impact of Saint Irdnee, Bishop of Lyon, on his thinking. Erica Simon, CG. et la France', GrSt, 7-22 (summary in Danish, 23-32), refers to this impact, but is also, and mainly, concerned with G.'s critique of French i8th-c. philosophy, the so-called Enlightenment (a name meaning something different from what G. called 'Oplysning'). Also in GrSt: Morten Bredsdorff, CG. og Shakespeare', 33-46 (on G.'s appreciation of the Elizabethan dramatist not only as a 'universal genius', but also as a 'Nordic' spirit ? cf. 'Nordens Mythologi', 1832); Hellmut Toftdahl, 'Debatten om G. og Kierkegaard. En kritisk gennemgang', 47-86 (on the relatively few attempts at comparison made by previous scholars, from F. Jungersen in 1873 to the contributors to the first vol. of Kontroverse um Kierkegaard und G., 1966); William Michelsen, rev. of Toftdahl's above-mentioned book, 95-102. Christian Thodberg, En glemt dimension i G.s salmer ? bundetheden til dabsritualet, G. E. C. Gad, 128 pp., convincingly demonstrates that G.'s hymns are closely related to the baptis</page><page sequence="21">Literature 665 mal ritual introduced by N. E. Balle in 1783. This relationship can hardly be experienced by churchgoers today, since a new ritual has removed the congregation from G.'s point of depar ture; liturgically, therefore, his hymns have to a certain degree got the character of 'meningsmaessige tomrum'.

HAUCH Jorgen Breitenstein, 'Carsten H.s romaner', DSt, 20-47, demonstrates that the six novels in question may advan tageously be referred to the great tradition originating from Goethe's 'Wilhelm Meister'. The novels are examined with a view to the grouping and delineation of characters, as well as to features that may be traced back to Goethe and Jean Paul. JACOBSEN Frederic Durand, Jens Peter J. ou La gravitation d'une solitude, Caen, La Faculte des Lettres et Sciences Humaines de l'Uni versite, 1968, 390 pp. This lengthy study is based on the assumption that J.'s life and writings were determined by a 'liberty-instinct', that prohibited an engagement in concrete existential problems. The consequence was that he ended up in a position of self-imposed loneliness ('solitude'). On the whole D.'s picture of J. ('une ame qu'aucun souffle impur n'avait ternie') seems to be far too idealized. But this is not the only reason why his meritorious attempt to bring J. research into a more fruitful situation must be considered partly un successful. His concepts are rather loosely contoured; he does not settle with previous scholars; his understanding of 'dream' in J.'s writings is incorrect (dream belongs to what is beyond reality ? it is, therefore, an unsatisfactory basis of existence); his aesthetic verdicts are not presented as conclusions to detailed analyses; and he is too fond of 'parallels' between fiction and life, and between fiction produced by J. and fiction produced by previous writers. Nonetheless, because of Durand's emphasis</page><page sequence="22">666 Danish Studies on anthropological and existential problems, and because of many shrewd observations in the third part of the book ('L'Art du Poete'), his efforts are far from vain.

The German romanticist expounded a mystical unification of the seasons, his Danish colleague experienced their alternation as evidence of a divine order ? and spring's coming as a symbol of the defeat of Death. In fact Novalis's gnosticism was alien to Oe.'s spiritual make-up. He admitted elements of Greek mythology to come into his cycle, i.e. he interpreted the Christian myth in a pagan direction.

ANDERSEN NEX0 On the occasion of the centenary of A.N.'s birth (26 June) a number of writers, critics, and scholars in 13 countries were invited to formulate their opinion of the great socialist writer; the answers appeared under the heading 'Martin A.N.: A Symposium', Sea, 8: 121-35. Many other contributions were publ. on the same occasion, e.g., Poul Houe, 'Martin A.N.s ungdomsarbejder', NT, 45: 419-27, and Borge Houmann, 'Da Martin A.N. sprang af til venstre', Tiden, 30: 176-90. The chief event was, however, the publ. of Breve fra Martin A.N., ed. and comm. Borge Houmann, DSL, Gyldendal, 391 pp., 2 pis. For obvious reasons (the number of A.N.'s correspondents amounts to at least 1,200!) the ed. is highly selective. The present vol. contains 262 letters (and an introd., 9-33, in which A.N.'s lit. career is outlined). Vols 2-3 are in preparation. Also to be mentioned: Borge Houmann, Nu ? eller aldrig.

Some new biog. information is provided by the letterpress, but the book does not contribute anything essential to the understanding of B.'s writings. Karen B.s Tegninger, ed. and introd.

Sven Havsteen Mikkelsen, Gyldendal, 1967-9, 439 and 399 pp., indexed. This sympathetic monograph by a younger friend and col league of H.'s is mainly concerned with the relationship between life and writings, with attitudes and intentions. Diaries, letters, draft material, non-fictive sources, personal recollec tions, etc., are taken into account. The fictional works are treated basically in the same way (as human docs) and studied with regard to genesis and background, but only occasionally analysed and evaluated from structural-aesthetic points of view. While Thorkild Bjornvig's diss. for the doctorate (Kains Alter, 1964) may be characterized as a dialogue with H.'s</page><page sequence="29">Literature 673 writings, a tendency towards identification and hero-worship may be found in W.'s in many ways remarkable attempt to revise Bjornvig's understanding of H. (cf. TWML, 26: 579-80). The first vol. (sub-titled Fra Barndommen til Krigens Aar) defends the theses that H.'s 'self-understanding' progressed as a pre occupation with dualism as the formula of his mental structure (a dualism which he traced back to family conditions and regional circumstances and found mythically paralleled in the 'ellekonge' symbol), and that his participation in the resistance movement, esp. his defence of the liquidation of informers, caused a serious conflict in him between 'life' and 'art'. This crisis did not paralyse his creative powers, however; it provoked a hectic productivity. In the second vol. (sub-titled Fra Krigens Aar til Doden) it is asserted that during the first post-war years H. attained a new understanding of tradition and of his own position in the course of history. But this insight conflicted with his obligation towards a modernism to which he had contributed substantially. According to Wivel this is the clue to the fact that H. did not produce any work of fiction after 'Logneren', 1950 ? a novel in which fiction is paradoxically repudiated as a source of true knowledge about existence. Of course 'Logneren' plays a prominent part in Wivel's account ? in the same way as 'Orm og Tyr' in which H. established some sort of balance between his moral and artistic identity. Martin A.H., Isen bryder, ed. Ole Wivel, Gyldendal, 36 pp. This story may be read on its own merits, but attracts attention mainly because the MS. (typewritten, 15 pp., dated 17-19 February 1945) served as H.'s point of departure, when the Danish State Radio asked him to write a 'radioroman' (result: 'Logneren'). A draft (typewritten, 8 pp., dated 14 October 1942) was found among H.'s papers, while the present booklet was in the press ? as reported on in the postscript.
