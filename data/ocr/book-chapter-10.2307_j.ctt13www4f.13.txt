<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 5. The Icon of the Trinity by   Andrei Rublev While the compositions of the Anastasis and the Transfiguration represent the  realm of oikonomia (all the works by which God reveals himself and communicates  his life), the figurative representation of the Trinity circumscribes the domain  of theologia (the mystery of God’s inmost life within the Blessed Trinity).1  Prior to the hesychast controversy, Latin fathers introduced the filioque clause  as an addition to the Nicene Creed, but the hesychasts condemned and refuted  this dogma. In their endeavour to defend the Christological and Trinitarian  dogma, the hesychasts affirmed the ontological distinction within the Triune  God. They accepted the difference between the hypostases of the Father, the  Son and the Holy Spirit and, at the same time, acknowledged the unity of nature  in the Trinity. Palamists also developed an elaborate teaching concerning the  Soteriological role of divine grace. These theological presuppositions were  founded in the steadfast parameters of theophania (the Epiphany) and theoptia  (the vision of the Triune God). The art of the Palaeologan era reflected the  theological dogma of the hesychast, with the iconography of the Hospitality  of Abraham acquiring a Trinitarian rather than Christological connotation.2  Rublev’s version of the Hospitality of Abraham (Old Testament Trinity) is the  best example of this iconographical trend (Fig. 51). The Old Testament Trinity in theology Images of the Trinity in the form of three angels represent Chapter 18 of the  Book of Genesis. Abraham treats the visit of the three angels as a revelation  of God (contrast Judges 13), but what he sees is not God alone but ‘three men  standing nearby’ (Genesis 18:2). Abraham meets the men and greets them with  low bows; initially he addressed his fulsome words of welcome to one of the men  only (18:3), but he subsequently addressed all three (18:4–5a) who respond.  The shift from one to three (18:1–3) matches the corresponding shifts that occur  in Abraham’s speech (18:3–5). In the follow-up, however, the reverse happens,  and the focus shifts from the three to the one. The three men dine together  1  A. Strezova, ‘Relations of Image to its Prototype in Byzantine Iconophile Theology’, Byzantinoslavica,  vol. 66, no. 1–2 (2008). In using the term theology, the Byzantine fathers understood it to be about God as he  is in himself; this is Trinitarian theology. The term oikonomia (divine dispensation), on the other hand, also  presupposed a Trinitarian basis, and focused on two facts: the work of Christ (Christology–Soteriology), and  divine and continuous work through the Spirit (Pneumatology and Ecclesiology). 2  In the earlier representations of the Trinity the main emphasis was on the figure of the middle angel– Christ (Christological connotation), whereas in later centuries the painters aimed to represent the unity of the  Trinity (Trinitarian connotation). 173 </page> <page sequence="2"> Hesychasm and Art under a tree and they invite Abraham’s wife Sarah to join them, but it is one  of them (God) who proclaims to Abraham that Sarah ‘will give birth to a son’.  He also expresses his displeasure at Sarah’s incredulity (18: 8–15). When they  finish the meal, however; ‘the three visitors’ depart for Sodom together with  Abraham. God decides to inform Abraham about the purpose of their journey  (18:17–19); although the declaration that follows seems atypical in this situation  (18:20–21) and it is not clearly addressed to Abraham, but it is communicated  in the first person rather than in plural (‘I will go down to see ...’ in contrast  to ‘come, let Us go down and there confuse their language’ (Genesis 11:7–8).  ‘The two men’ now continue their journey to Sodom, but Abraham questions  God about his plans for the town (18:22). God is shown as one of the ‘three visitors’, and not, for example, as speaking  and acting through all three of them. A clear difference exists between God,  who leaves once he finishes the dialogue with Abraham, and the ‘two travellers’  (18:33), who ‘came to Sodom in the evening’ (19:1, cf. 18:1). The ‘three men’  (18:2) thus consist of God himself and ‘two angels’, even if the narrator does  not, surprisingly, affirm this difference, or dismiss the likelihood of three divine  beings, two of them unknown to Abraham, visiting his home. The two visitors  are identified as ‘angels’ (19:1–15), but their relationship to God is puzzling.  The men take Lot and members of Lot’s family and lead them safely out of town.  However, it is only one God who states, ‘Flee for your lives! Do not look back,  and do not stop anywhere in the plain!’ (18:17). The reference to one God raises  the question of whether God has met the two angels outside the gates of Sodom,  after they escorted Lot out of the city? It is not clear that such a meeting ever  took place as the narrator tried to preserve God’s essential mystery. However,  the Septuagint’s plural reading brings this statement into an agreement with  Lot’s response: And ‘Lot said to them. “No my Lords please!”’ (18:18). In spite  of this, Lot discusses a possible shelter for himself with a particular partner  (18:18–20) who openly identifies himself as the Lord, the cause of the forthcoming  destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (18:21–24). There is no further information  about the angels. The angel who said ‘I cannot do anything until you reach it’  is obviously identical to God who ‘rained down burning sulphur on Sodom  and Gomorrah’ (18:22, 24). Does this denote that God reverted to heaven after  conversing with Lot, in order to begin the destruction from there? Or, does  the odd repetition of Yahweh’s name indicate that he exists simultaneously in  heaven and on earth? If the Lord is indeed almighty, as Abraham points out  (18:25), one would not expect him to leave his heavenly throne vacant. There are three distinct but interrelated problems in the narrative of Genesis  18–19. First, the affiliation between the Lord and the ‘three angels’ is uncertain  in Genesis 18. Secondly, while Adam identifies two of the visitors as ‘angels’  (19:1–15), their function is puzzling, especially the one who acts as authority.  174 </page> <page sequence="3"> 5 . The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  Thirdly, there is the difficulty of accepting the presence of God in heaven and  on earth at the same time. The first and the second issues describe the dogma  of perichoresis (the interactions among the three). The third deals with the issue  of the hypostatic union in Christ, which affects the liaison between the visible  God and the Godhead. Interpretation Philo was one of the earliest writers to provide an allegorical interpretation  of Genesis 18.3 He supposed that it was a mystical vision of God in which the  three angels are the self-existent, beneficent, and sovereign powers of God.4  Hence, Abraham’s vision of three travellers was only a sighting of three men  because he could not perceive their divine nature.5 Flavius Josephus avoided  the ambiguity, which is present in the Holy Scriptures, the Septuagint and  Philo’s writings, and claimed that angels can and did assume human form and  even eat men’s food.6 Origen affirmed that the revelation of the uncreated light  of God given to Abraham was a prerequisite for his vision of God and the two  ‘angels’.7 The appearance of the angels, on the other hand, signifies the mystery  of the Trinity.8 Origen considered Abraham a model of a spiritual person who  could see the ultimate mysteries of God.9 Western fathers, such as Ambrose  of Milan from the 4th century, Peter Chrysologus from the 5th century, and  Caesarius of Arles from the early 6th century, affirm Origen’s interpretation.10  The Origenist tradition continued in the theological tradition of the Eastern  fathers, in particularly in the writings of the 5th-century Cyril of Alexandria,  and Procopius of Gaza from the 6th century.11 Justin the Philosopher discussed God’s apparition to Moses and to Abraham and  other Old Testament prophets, but did not perceive those visions as revelations  3  S.

The Logos conducted the providential  and creative work of the Father. God did reveal himself in the form of angels;  he also took a human body and appeared to Abraham. Tertullian also claimed  that Abraham received a vision of the Son, but this revelation was not about the  Trinitarian exegesis.13 Eusebius of Caesarea argued that the Hospitality of Abraham was a theophany.  Abraham saw one ‘man’ whom he worshipped as a deity, he fell down  immediately and addressed one of them as Godhead. John Chrysostom upheld  that the righteous Abraham referred to the three strangers as ‘my Lord’, but he  gave precedence to one of them. Chrysostom elaborated further by stating the  two angels went to destroy the town while the Lord continued the conversation  with the righteous.14 He further read this story as a revelation of Christ to  Abraham. The two angels shared in his redemptive work and divine mysteries.  Cyril of Alexandria established the episode at Mamre was a revelation of the  Holy Trinity because, although Abraham saw three people, he addressed them  as one.15 The tradition that affirmed this episode as a revelation of the Holy Trinity  continued in the later Eastern exegetic tradition. The author of the Anonymous  Dialogue with Jews,16 as well as Maximus the Confessor, wrote extensively about  this aspect. Maximus perceived the spiritual world as mystically imprinted on  the sensible world in symbolic forms. This reciprocity allowed any material  image, like Abraham’s three angelic forms, to serve as signs manifesting the  invisible and unknowable Trinity to those prepared to see it properly with their  spiritual sight. For Abraham, it was a true contemplative, transcending matter  through the recognition of the imago Trinities (image of the Trinity) in his soul.  The Hospitality of Abraham affirms the fusion of antinomical nature of God,  both the Monad (unity of the Trinity) and the Triad (the three hypostases of  God).17 Gregory the Theologian claimed that Abraham received a vision of God, not  in his role as deity, but as a man.18 Augustine of Hippo affirmed Abraham’s  12 Justin’s Dialogue with Trypho, 127, in P.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  understanding of the Unity of the Trinity:19 ‘while greeting the three strangers  Abraham confessed to one God in three hypostases.20 This event was, therefore,  a symbolic prefiguration of the Trinitarian nature of God.21 In his later writings,  Augustine of Hippo refrained from any visual representation of the doctrine of  the Trinity.22 Athanasius of Sinai and Ambrose of Milan noted the event to be a Trinitarian  revelation.23 Procopius of Gaza summarised the Christian view about the  identity of Abraham’s three guests as follows: the three men were either three  angels, or possibly one of them was God while the other two were angels.  Most probably the three men addressed by Abraham in the singular served as  a type for the holy and consubstantial Trinity. Finally, the great defender of  icons, John of Damascus, wrote that Abraham did not see the divine nature.  ‘For no one has ever seen God, but he saw an image of God to whom he made  a sign of supplication’.24 The General Vigil Service of the Holy Fathers describes the event as a revelation  of the triune hypostatic God to Abraham (song 5). In addition, the Canon of  Joseph the Psalt reads ‘you saw the Trinity as was possible for humans and  provided them with hospitality, the righteous Abraham’ (song 5). Similar  statements are found in the Canon of the Metropolitan of Smyrna (from the  middle of the 9th century). The iconography of the Trinity The desire to represent the ineffable mystery of the Trinity goes back to the  early stages of Christian iconography. Any iconographic evidence of the Western  composition of the Trinity is sparse, however, perhaps reflecting the weight of  Augustinian authority.25 Also, due to the iconoclastic controversy, only limited  examples remain from the Christian first millennium in the East.26 19 Since three men appeared, and no one was said to be greater than the others, either in form, age, or  power, why should we not understand, as visibly intimated by the visible creature, the equality of the Trinity,  and one and the same substance in three persons?

From beginning of the Christian era, simple geometric shapes were used in the West to symbolise the Trinity. 26 T. de Régnon, Etudes sur la Sainte Trinité, vol. 1 (Paris 1892) 167–215. 177 </page> <page sequence="6"> Hesychasm and Art Analysis of Western images of the Trinity shows that, until the 13th century,  the Western tendency to emphasise one substance (ousia) of the Trinity, rather  than affirming the characteristics of the three hypostases of God, was reflected  in art. In fact, the image of a single Godhead as a symbol for the grandeur of  the Holy Trinity was common in Western art. Occasionally, however, the image  of Christ symbolised all three hypostases of the Trinity.27 Panofsky stated that  it was essential to use a single image to represent the Trinity in the West, and  for that purpose the painters in the Western tradition introduced the image  of glorified Christ (Majestas Domini).28 This evolution passed through the  stages of polymorphic images of Christ, such as compositions of the Paternitas,  the Synthronoi and the Throne of Mercy as seen in Carolingian examples of the  9th and 10th centuries.29 Because of the complexity of the hypostatic relationships of the Trinity,  the search for an acceptable representation of the Holy Trinity in the Eastern  tradition started from a different perspective than in the West.30 The use of  anthropomorphic iconographic variants for circumscription of the Trinity  proved unpopular in the East. The first stage in this direction dates from the  time of Photius; however, after the schism of 1054, new iconographic models  of Christ Emmanuel and the Ancient of Days arose, as well as anthropomorphic  images of the Holy Trinity, especially the Paternitas images.31 Despite the spread  of archaic images of the Trinity, only one iconic type; e.g., the Hospitality of  Abraham (the Old Testament Trinity), was in accordance with the doctrines of  the Church.32 The earliest evidence of the Hospitality of Abraham (Genesis 18) comes from  the catacombs of the Via Latina, Rome; the paintings in these catacombs date to  about 320–350. This composition represents only the first phase of the biblical  story —Abraham’s meeting with the angels. A bearded Abraham sits at his  midday meal under the oak of Mamre with three youths in white garments  standing before him on the right, on a raised circular platform. Abraham greets  the approaching youths with his raised right hand, and they respond with  the same gesture.33 To his right, a calf symbolises hospitality.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  mosaics, which combined several scenes in a single picture; the 6th-century  representation from San Vitale, Ravenna,and the 5th-century mosaics of Santa  Maria Maggiore, Rome, are good examples (Figs 52, 53).34 In these monuments,  the regular scheme of the Hospitality of Abraham takes on a dogmatic character.  The three beardless youths are notable in being depicted with halos; a mandorla  encloses the central figure. The clothes of the three angels are the same;  with slight variations in the gestures. The youth on the right points his finger  at the bread, whereas the youth on the left holds up his hand in blessing;  he slightly turns towards the figure of the middle youth, who points at the  calf. Clearly, the focus is on the sacrificial meal, which suggests the artist had  an interest in the symbolic meaning of the event. Similary in the San Vitale  Hospitality of Abraham in which the three youths are almost identical to each  other, even as far as gestures. The central angel and the angel on the right make  a sign of benediction with their right hands. The left- and right-hand of the  figures point to three disc-shaped loaves each marked with an X. Besides the  figures of angels in the iconographic scheme, Abraham, Sarah and the servants  are represented. Symbolic images of Abraham’s hamber and the oak at Mamre  fill the landscape surrounding the figures.35 At the beginning of the 11th century, the iconography of the Hospitality of  Abraham gained new momentum, presenting its characteristic components  and roles in a direct and distinct way. The central angel is in the guise of the  historical Jesus, wearing characteristic costume and depicted with symbolic  adjuncts. The middle angel is larger than the two flanking angels, who move  to the corners of the table and are turned to the side.36 The meaning of this  composition is Christological, the middle angel (Christ) serves as a prototype  for the Trinity. Infrequently, the flanking angels also had a cruciform halo as  well, as in the icon of the 14th-century Paternitas composition from Tretyakov  Gallery.37 The setting differs as guests sit around a semi-circular, as opposed  to square, table. These representations are regularly labelled as images of the  ‘Holy Trinity’. A miniature found in the Greek Psalter of the 9th century is  a good example of this trend. The central characteristic of this image is the  fact that the three figures have no wings. The middle angel has a nimbus  decorated with a cross.38 The Armenian Gospel of Vehap’ar (unknown in the  West until 2000), is of importance, presenting the Biblical narrative of Genesis  34  A.

It is important to note the positioning of the figures in the previous two  examples. Their arrangement was not consistent with the principle of isocephalia  (the heads of the figures in the composition brought to the same level), but in  a semi-circle. The table has a semi-circular shape. The middle angel is slightly  higher in the pictorial plane with the two other angels standing on both sides of  the horizontal plane. This is the so-called Syriac model of the Trinity, commonly  used in the Eastern provinces,41 and later spreading to the Western world.42  In its fundamental conception, this iconographic type remained almost  unchanged during the 12th century. Slight variations are evident in the Cappella  Palatina at Norman Place, Palermo (12th century), where the three men have  wings and messengers’ staves; one of the angels has a nimbus with a red outline,  and above the scene is the inscription ‘Holy Trinity’.43 During the Comneanian  era, the moment of greeting and the reception of the three personages at the  table became separate compositions, for example, in the Cathedral of Monreale  (end of the 12th century).44 A tendency to unify all three angels, by slightly  bending the heads of the side angels towards the middle angel, was initiated in  the late Byzantine artistic tradition.45 The ‘medieval’ model of the Trinity continued in the late Comnenian and  Palaeologan periods. An arduous contrapposto substituted the frontal position  of the central angel;46 who turns his head towards the left angel. As a result,  the affective relations between the three angels are elicited, creating a revived  sense of movement and spatial depth. Churches of the Forty Martyrs, Turnovo;  St Sophia, Kiev; St Sophia, Ohrid; are excellent representations of the Trinity.47 39 The Armenian Gospel of Vehap’ar was shown for the first time in the Treasures from the Ark exhibition  at the British Library.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  In the late Palaeologan period, depictions had an indefinite architectural  coulisse (background), serving to abstract the figures from their historical  context. Moreover, Abraham and Sarah abandon their original post and all  other elements and superfluous objects were removed from the pictorial plane.  The figures of the three angels were no longer depicted in semi-circle, with a  special position given to the middle angel, as in previous times. Rather, the  three angels are equal and represented in a full circle. The table changes shape  from circular to square.48 The Trinity of San Marco,Venice (13th century), heralds the beginning of a new  type in the West, which aims to reflect the history of Hospitality of Abraham,  rather than portraying the Trinity. There is a tendency to unify the three angels  by inclining their heads toward the centre. The figures are positioned according  to the standard of isocephalia; they resemble a frieze.49 Unfortunately, no similar  icon of high artistic value can be found from 13th-century Constantinople  except, possibly, a small circular icon bearing the title of the Holy Trinity. Greek  in origin, this example goes back to the same prototype as that of Rublev.50  The knees of the central angel rise and the shape of the chalice and the gold  lines of the table are reminiscent of Rublev’s Trinity. This detail, the semicircular  shape of the table, around which the angels sit, comes from the Oriental model  of the previous century. It is not repeated in the Palaeologan iconography.  Whereas the purpose of this icon was to highlight the central angel, Rublev  aimed to present the three angels as equals.51 A 13th-century Italian miniature in the British Museum (Ad. 15, 268) resembles  a Byzantine example from the 12th century (in particular, the figure of Abraham  resembles that of Amos from the 12th-century Vatican manuscript), with the  proportions of the drapery almost reproducing that of Vat. Gr. 1153, fol. 20.  A singular angelic form is subordinate to the figurative scene (in the curve of  the body), and the central angel is slightly shifted, resembling the middle angel  of Rublev. The motion of the oak repeats the movement of the body of Christ, as  is the case in Rublev. This iconographic novelty contributed to the development  of a new composition of the Trinity. In Russia, this innovative development in iconography surfaced before Rublev.  Some of the finest artworks of this period include a mural in St Sophia Cathedral,  Kiev (11th century), and the bronze south door of the Church of Nativity of  the Virgin, Suzdal (13th century).52 Two famous frescoes from the Church in  48 V.N.

Three breads and three  chalices are placed on the table, with a large chalice being in the middle of the  table. The most significant details are the gestures of the three angels; the one  on the left points to the chalice, the one on the right blesses one of three loaves,  and the one in the middle blesses the table.54 The advent of the Anaphora Troparion (of the third hour) and the liturgical  reforms brought by Metropolitan Cyprian and patriarch Philotheus brought  out new elements into the figurative scene of the Trinity. The fundamental  importance of the anaphora predetermined significant changes in the structure  of the iconostasis in Russia, with a new iconography of the ‘Trinity’ arising  for the first time as part of the Feast cycles.55 The image of the Old Testament  Trinity gained popularity after hesychasm’s spread into Russia. It was no longer  overloaded with details of the Biblical narrative of Genesis 18 and, instead, an  allegorical reading of the narrative occurred, and the story itself took on a more  rudimentary character in art. The best example of this trend is Rublev’s Old  Testament icon of the Trinity. Andrei Rublev and his art Little is known about the life of Andrei Rublev, the famous painter of the Trinity.  Many scholars agree that he was born between 1360 and 1370. For a short  period, he lived in the Trinity Lavra of St Sergius near Moscow. He was under  the spiritual guidance of monk Nikon, a hegumen of the monastery after the  passing of Sergius of Radonezh (1392).56 Afterwards, Rublev lived in Zvenigorod,  in Vladimir Suzdal and at the Spaso-Andronikov monastery near Moscow.57 The first mention of Rublev comes from the chronicles which testify that in  1405 the Grand Prince Vasily Dmitrievich, commissioned three iconographers,  53  M.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  Theophanes the Greek, Prokhorov of Gorodets and Rublev to work on the  Annunciation Cathedral in Moscow’s Kremlin. Rublev’s name, with the  designation ‘the monk’, is last on the list of masters, which suggests that he  was the youngest.58 Researchers assert that seven icons of the festival cycle  in this cathedral, including Baptism, Birth of Christ, Presentation of the Lord,  Transfiguration, Annunciation, Resurrection of Lazarus and Entry into Jerusalem  belong to Rublev. These works are in a Byzantine style and demonstrate Rublev’s  exceptional talent. Rublev created another work of art during this period,  a book illumination of Khitrovo Gospel. This wonderful miniature contains an  image of an angel, which as Alpatov claimed, symbolises Evangelist Matthew.59  The chronicles also mention that Rublev and Daniil Chernii (another famous  Russian iconographer) worked on the Assumption Cathedral, Vladimir in 1408.  The frescoes painted by Rublev exist in fragments and occupy the western wall  of the church. The fragments depict images of the trumpeting angel, of Apostle  Peter as well as of the Last Judgment.60  Extensive research has revealed that in 1410 Rublev painted one of the  Zvenigorod churches. The icons Saviour, Archangel Michael and St Paul from  Zvenigorod are attributed to Rublev and they feature a new stage in Rublev’s  painting, expressing the beginning of the Golden Age — the flourishing of icon  painting in Russia. About the same time, Rublev created another outstanding  work, a version of the famous Byzantine image of Our Lady of Vladimir.  The image indicates that Rublev created this icon as an experienced master, who  had his own school of painting.61 From 1425–1427 Rublev worked together with Chernii on the new stone  cathedral of the Holy Trinity. It is probably during this time Rublev painted  the main feature of the monastery — the icon of the Holy Trinity. Epiphanius  the Wise claimed that Rublev helped with the decoration and construction of  the church. Rublev painted his last works at the Cathedral of the Saviour at  Andronikov Monastery, Moscow, where he passed away in 1430. He was buried  in the altar vaults near his close friend Chernii. Rublev was canonised a saint  in 1988 by the Russian Orthodox Church and his feast day is celebrated on  29 January and 4 July.62 58  Uliyanov, ‘The Deesis Painted by Andrey Rublev from the Annunciation Church of the Moscow Kremlin  (on the 575th year of the demise of the reverend icon-painter)’, Hierarchy in Aancient Russia, M.

The Byzantine canon of icon-painting, which spread  to Russia under the influence of Theophanes, as well as the legacy of the older  Russian school of art, are often mentioned in connection with the development  of Rublev’s style. Also, the Novgorodian school of painting, as well as Rublev’s  spiritual beliefs and monastic life, were important influences on him. Sergius  of Radonezh’s affinity to the hesychast dogma and the cult of the Trinity, as  well as Theophanes’s artistic style, penetrated by a mystical spirit, affected the  development of Rublev’s style of painting. Sergius of Radonezh and the cult of the Trinity Sergius of Radonezh was a crucial influence on Rublev who lived and worked  under his auspices. In fact, Rublev painted his famous icon of the Trinity to  serve as a memorial to Sergius of Radonezh. Sergius was a Russian ascetic who exercised significant influence on domestic  spirituality as well as on Rublev’s personality. In fact, the life of St Sergius,  the hegumen of the Holy Trinity Lavra, was often taken as a model of ascetic  existence by contemporaries of Rublev. The Monastery of the Holy Trinity, in  turn, was a place where notions of love of God, calm and self-discipline, and  mystical union with God were propagated. Sergius was a prayer enthusiast; he revived monasticism in Russia in the  14th century and brought the tradition of bezmolvie (hesychia) to Russia,  both in theory and practice (his disciples were on Athos at the height of the  hesychast controversy). In the Vitae of St Sergius, Epiphanius stated that the  saint had frequent visions of the uncreated light during prayer and other  beatific revelations.63 The most important of them is the the icon of Theotokos,  when the Virgin Mary promised to Sergius the protection of Russian people.  The particulars of the epiphany are reminiscent of Abraham’s vision of the three  angels in the Old Testament (Genesis 18). Apparitions of the Virgin Mary were  uncommon in the 14th and 15th centuries and Russian monks took it as a divine  sign that the Lord granted Russia a special protection. Sergius apparently had other spiritual visions during prayer, which were  also witnessed by his followers, whose testimony asserts the frequency of his  visions of the divine light. Some aspects of these visions are reminiscent of  those experienced by Byzantine practitioners of hesychasm, such as Symeon  63  Епифанием Премудрым, ‘Житие и Чудеса Преподобного Сергия’, Chpt 31, online version http:// www.stsl.ru/lib/book2/index.htm (accessed 10/07/2012). 184 </page> <page sequence="13"> 5 . The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  the New Theologian.64 For instance, one of Sergius’s disciples, Simeon, stated  that when Sergius conducted the liturgy, the ‘divine light’ was often seen at the  altar situated around the Eucharist. On one occasion, when Sergius wanted to  receive communion, ‘the divine fire moved up from the altar, curled up as a kind  of cloth, and entering the holy chalice’. Simeon claimed that this insight gave  Sergius his wonderful mystical knowledge, and many other gifts such as healing  the sick, casting out demons, and even resurrecting the dead.65 Apart from the fact that Sergius was a recipient of visions and a miracle worker,  the most significant feature of his spirituality was his special affinity with the  Holy Trinity.66 In the Vitae of St Sergius, Epiphanius recorded Sergius’s founding  of the Monastery of the Trinity and aspects of his devotion to this cult.67  To give sound support to this claim, Epiphanisu referred to the hymns written  by Sergius in praise of the Trinity. Sergius was the first Russian religious to give a sound idea of the Holy Trinity. He  transformed it into a symbol of the Christian dogma of unity, the accord to which  all must strive to live on earth. In the religious and philosophical sense, this  image of the Trinity, as the ideal of life on earth, opened the way for the removal  of the dilemma — national or universal. Consequently, the cult of the Holy  Trinity, in whose honour Sergius dedicated a monastery, became a symbol of the  unity of Russia. As a result of this dogma, images of the Holy Trinity appeared  throughout Russia as a possible way to save the real state.68 Interestingly, before  Sergius accepted the dogma of the Holy Trinity, the cult of the Trinity was not  seen as a necessary part of orthodox life in Russia. For example, pictorial cycles  were usually devoted to Christ, the mother of God, St Nicholas, the holy warriors  and the fathers of the Church. Only in the Kiev-Pechersk Monastery was the cult  of the Trinity followed in the early 12th century. It is possible that Sergius was familiar with the cult of the Holy Trinity established  by the monks of the Kiev-Pechersk and that he used it as an example. The cult  of the Trinity in the 14th and 15th centuries spread to such extent that Serius of  Radonezh was activly followed by a constellation of students and belivers. Some  of them testified to receiving visions of the Trinity themselves. St Alexander  Svirsky (1433) spoke about his vision of the Triune God, showing in the form  of three men. St Macarius Zheltovodsky (1444) also experienced a similar kind  64 H. Alfeyev, Saint Symeon, the New Theologian, and Orthodox tradition (Oxford 2000) 226. 65 J.L.

The Acts of the Church Council headed by St Macarius of Moscow  mention visions of light experienced by the monk, as well as the Council of  Hundred Chapters (Stoglav) in 1551 and the councils of 1553–1554, which  further affirmed the possibility and necessity for sacred images of the Holy  Trinity.70 Sergius called the Russian people to brotherly love, unity and spiritual  creation. He embodied the image of the Trinity as a symbol of Russian unity,  which was sought so eagerly in the 13th and 14th centuries. Shortly after his  death in 1392, he was canonised and later honoured as the patron and defender  of Moscow. Sergius’s devotion to the Holy Trinity was later reflected in Rublev’s icon  of the Trinity. The creation of this icon had a personal meaning for Rublev:  it was a gift to his mentors from the Trinity Sergius’s Lavra, who enriched his  moral values. This scene represented the significance of Sergius’s spirituality for  Russian people; a symbol of immersion in the mystery of the divine being, God’s  unity and indivisibility.71 Theophanes the Greek and Andrei Rublev Rublev’s art has arguably diverse influences, the most prominent of which is  Byzantine, and Greek Christian art, particularly of Theophanes the Greek, the  famous iconographer who came to Russia at the end of 14th century. Theophanes was born around 1330, and died sometime between 1405 and 1409.  During his short-lived residency in Novgorod, Theophanes painted the famous  murals of the Church of the Transfiguration. He also decorated the Church on  Volotovo-Field and the Cathedral of St Theodore Stratelates. After finishing work  in Kostroma in 1390, Theophanes relocated to Moscow in 1395. The production  of miniatures for the illuminated Khitrovo Gospel was the first of Theophanes’s  Muscovite work.72 He also prepared the design of well-known manuscripts,  such as the Psalter of Ivan VI Grozny (Ivan IV the Terrible, from the last quarter  of 14th century) and the Pogodin’s Manuscript (second half of the 15th century).  Moreover, he is credited as the painter of the famous icon Our Lady of the Don  (c. 1395).73 While Theophanes probably produced many art works during the  69 А.V.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  course of his life, scholars accept the following nine paintings as his: Dormition  of the Virgin, Virgin of the Don, St Paul, Saviour in Glory, St John Chrysostom,  St John the Evangelist, St Basil and the Archangel Gabriel. He created these  icons in 1405 for the iconostasis of Moscow’s Cathedral of the Annunciation.  The utilisation of complex drawing techniques and the mystical qualities of  these representations suggest that Theophanes was a master painter.74 Epiphanius described the discipline and austerity characteristic of  Theophanes’s art: while he [Theophanes] sketched and painted, no one saw him glancing  at models as some of other painters do, staring at forms with amazement,  looking here and there, doing less of the actual painting than observing.  In his spirit, he encompassed distant and intellectual realities. With his  spiritual eyes, he contemplated spiritual beauty.75 The relationship between Theophanes and his pupil Rublev was enigmatic,  but he invited Rublev and Prokhorov of Gorodets to work with him on the  Annunciation Cathedral. In the process, he advanced Rublev’s genius.76  Rublev later refrained from the dramatic expression, which characterised the  style of Theophanes and instigated his own style of painting. Theophanes’s use  of monochrome colours and his use of pure forms, however, testify that he was  an extraordinary master who played a great part in development of the mature  Moscow icon painting. A single hesychast dogma influenced both Theophanes and Rublev, but their  differences in artistic style are the result of the humanist debate, a poignant part  of the hesychast controversy within Byzantium, but not in the Slavic lands.77  Certain tension between the humanist and hesychast trend existed in Byzantine  culture from its beginnings. Russian people, however, who felt no loyalty to  the classical Hellenic tradition, experienced no conflict between humanist and  hesychast thought. Liturgical practices, monastic obedience and icon painting  were the main spiritual practices in Russia before the 14th century. Hesychast  components were integrated in Russian consciousness without the humanist  thought which affected the hesychast movement in Byzantium.78 It is on this  basis that the art of Rublev was created. On the other hand, Theophanes’s  affinity with Byzantine hesychast tradition presented through his adoption of  74  D. Talbot Rice &amp; T.

The frescoes of the Church of the Transfiguration, Novgorod, testify to his  spiritual insight, knowledge of the mystical contemplative experience, as well  as his sympathy with the ancient past. Although the frescoes of the Church of the Transfiguration, Novgorod, are  preserved in small fragments, such incomplete forms show the skill, depth  and exceptional qualities of Theophanes’s creative genius. Most notable is  the adoption of a monochrome technique of painting, in ochre and white.  Theophanes’s unusual colour palette has been the subject of substantial research,  with some scholars suggesting that a fire bleached the frescoes of the Church of  the Transfiguration. Extensive archaeological investigation, however, has not  discovered traces of fire and restorers have confirmed that the layer of painting  is preserved in its original form. The colours of the original monochrome black  and white installation are an analogy to the hesychast method of prayer where  monks recite only few words (‘Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on  me, a sinner’) during meditation. The aim of this meditative practice was to  reach the final stage of mystical contemplation and acquire unity with God (by  grace).79 The affirmation of the Palamist dogma of the 14th century shaped to  an extent Theophanes’s unsurpassed painting style. Even greater, however, was  the influence of the mystical spirituality of St Macarius of Egypt and St Ephraim  the Syrian (in the 4th and 5th centuries) on Theophanes’s personal style of  Byzantine art.80 His most famous frescoes, in the Church of the Transfiguration,  Novgorod, depict saints Macarius and Ephraim. The fresco of St Macarius has a striking quality, reflecting all stages of the  spiritual journey of the saint and his mystical ascent to God. It illustrates the  state of transformation of St Macarius and his participation in the uncreated  light.81 The heavenly light, in the form of a white flame, envelops his long  ascetic figure. A bleaching flare burst shows the face of Macarius, but his eyes  are not defined. This unusual depiction is a deliberate statement that the saint  does not need sight because he could see God through his inner (spiritual) eye.  The face and the hands of the saint point against the light, with the subtle shape  of the saint’s body being transformed into an image of exceptional strength.  St Macarius plunges into the light, into the divine reality, but he does not  dissolve like salt in water. On the contrary, he retains his identity. St Macarius  lives in the light, and he is the light. This is a classic illustration of the hesychast  mystical experience.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  of the Trinity are, however, the most important, at least in relation to Rublev’s  icon of the Trinity.82 These relatively well-preserved murals in the small chapel  are designed for individual prayer. The program of the paintings is dedicated  to the contemplation of the ascetics of the Holy Trinity. In particular, the Old  Testament Trinity largely defines the style and personality of Theophanes. Rublev’s icon of the Trinity Rublev’s icon of the Trinity is the best known of all his paintings and the  only one that is fully authenticated. He painted it in honour of Sergius and at  the request of Nikon, the new abbot of the Lavra. Rublev was commissioned  by Nikon to paint an icon that would represent Sergius’s devotion to, and  understanding of, the Holy Trinity. Rublev painted the icon between 1392 and  1427 when Nikon became abbot of the Holy Trinity Monastery. During those  30 years, two churches were dedicated to the Holy Trinity: the wooden church  (1411–1412) and the stone cathedral (1422–1424). The 15th-century Life of St  Nikon by Pachomius the Serb reports that Rublev and Daniil Chernii went to  the Holy Trinity Monastery for adornment of the stone church of there. It is  probable, therefore, that Rublev painted his icon for one of these two churches. For more then 170 years after its creation, Rublev’s icon of the Trinity was hidden  under darkened oils and covered with surrounds of silver, gold and precious  gemstones.83 It was then repainted with fresh colours. The modern restoration  began with the cleaning of the icon in 1904–1906, a landmark in the rediscovery  of the icon and elevation of Rublev into the artistic canon. Restoration of  Rublev’s Trinity in 1918, by the team of Grabar and Anisimov, which involved  cleaning three layers of paint, revealed not the dark olive colours that are typical  of Rublev’s style, but rather, bright translucent colours.84 Rublev’s icon was  exhibited at the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow.85 Stories abound the unusual origin of this icon, such as that it was a part of the  iconostasis of the wooden church of the Trinity from the 15th century until  archaeologists discovered it in the early 20th century.86 Plugin upholds the view  that the only written text associating Rublev’s Trinity with the Monastery of  the Holy Trinity was the 17th century Narrative of the Holy Icon Painters.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  On the light (originally gold) background, three angels sit around a table on  which a bowl is placed. The middle angel stands above the rest; behind his back  is a tree, a mountain is depicted behind the angel on the right and behind the left  angel is a building. The heads of all three angels incline in silent conversation.  Their facial expressions are calm, and their facial types correspond to each  other, as though they are three versions of the same face. A system of concentric  cyrcles envelopes the composition. The haloes, the contours of the wings and  the angels’s hand movements create circles which converge at the chalice in the  epicentre of the icon. The shape of a lamb’s head is inside the chalice, or, if the  chalice is turned clockwise, this is the visage of the dead Christ.89 The lamb  symbolises the sacrificial offering of the Old Testament, and it is also a metaphor  for Christ, the sacrificial Lamb of God (cf. 1 Peter 1:9; John 1:29). The middle  angel blesses the chalice; the angel sitting at his right hand accepts the blessing,  and the angel to the left offers the chalice to the observer. The meaning of Rublev’s icon is transparent — in the heart of the Trinity icon,  a council for the redemption of humanity is in proceeding. The Eucharistic  meal is served — the section of the New Covenant and the blood of Christ  (cf. Luke 22:20). Salvation comes, however, universally. The three angels discuss  the restoration of the lost likeness (to God) of those redeemed and recreated by  Christ (Genesis 1:27).90 Thus, through love and the sacraments, and especially  through Baptism and the Eucharist, the faithful unite with Christ and through  him with God (John 4:15; 3:5; 6: 32; 17:1). On the front of the table, a small rectangle alludes to the cosmos. As God is  greater than all creation, and the cosmos is in the will of God and, what is more  important, is the plan of salvation of everything created, the true subject of the  icon is the eternal plan of God for redemption of humanity. Behind the middle angel, the oak of Mamre takes the form of a tree with leaves  arranged in a spiralling fashion, ascending to the right or to the left. The use of  a spiral motif goes back to the ancient tradition and refers to the rising aspects  of the soul’s journey to the divine.91 It also points to the symbolism of a ladder,  wonderfully depicted in the composition of the Ladder of Divine Ascent. The  oak itself is a metaphor of the ‘tree of knowledge of good and evil’ (Genesis  2:17), by which both sin and death were introduced into the world. The oak  also symbolises the tree of the Crucifixion by standing right behind the central  angelic figure.92 89  In the Roman ritual of the Mass, the priest uses the same sentence to invite worshippers to communion:  ‘behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world; P.

It is also reminiscent of Old Testament  passages (the Psalms in particular) referring to God as the ‘rock and the fortress’;  that is, the unshakable, unchangeable and eternal creator (Psalm 70:3). The rock  is also the cave of Bethlehem, in which the Virgin Mary gave birth to Christ.  Moreover, it represents the tomb of the Resurrection from which Jesus rose  (Matthew 27:60). Most importantly, the rock refers to the mountain of spiritual  ascent, the point of the revelation of the Triune God.93 The left angel sits before  a building, which may be the home of Abraham, father of the people of Israel.  It is also an allusion to the dwelling place of the Godhead. On the other hand,  the presence of the colour green, which runs from the church’s temple to the  green outer garment of the right-hand angel, and through the dark greenish- blue outer garment of the central angel, points to the renewal of creation.  Overall, however, the icon reflects the Greek idea of hesychia that affirmed the  unity of the One, instead of the multiplicity of many.94 What does Rublev’s Trinity portray if production of images of the Father and  the Holy Spirit was considered to be a breach of the second commandment? To  answer this question, one has to refer to the doctrine of metaphysical antinomy  of the absolute who is, at the same time, both visible and invisible (essence– energies distinction).95 The Cappadocian fathers explored the esoteric nature of  this antinomy in an attempt to defend the paradoxical nature of the Christian  God. Dionysius the Areopagite, however, also spoke about this dogma when  identifying ‘unions’ and ‘distinctions’ in the Godhead. Unions represent the  hidden essence of God, and distinctions are manifestations and powers, making  God known to humanity.96 In a similar fashion, Maximus affirmed the doctrine  of essence–energies, claiming God is knowable in what he imparts to us, but he  is not knowable in the incommunicability of his essence.97 During the hesychast controversy Gregory Palamas advanced the difference  between the divine nature (essence) and the divine energies. Palamists  understood the divine nature of God as forever inaccessible (like the centre of  the Sun) while the divine energies penetrate the universe (like the sunlight).98  93 P.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  The essence of God is beyond knowledge, contemplation, or participation.99  The divine energies, on the other hand, could be obtained and participated in as  ineffable, supersensible light — God’s glory.100 The divine energies act through  the deified subject, ‘energies to energies’, making it, by adoption, all that God  is by nature.101 The divine energies radiate to the created order ‘from the Father  as a source, through the Son as a form or definition, and in the Spirit as activator  and perfector’.102 The work is dependant on the relation each hypostasis ‘inheres  in the other two hypostases’ (perichoresis or communicatio idiomatum).103  The relationship between the three hypostasis is determined by the origins  of the Son and the procession of the Spirit from the unoriginate Father.104  Because the divine essence is not a subject of knowledge that is, ‘uncreated,  indivisible, incomprehensible and uncircumscribable’, the difference between  the generation of the Son, and procession of the Spirit cannot be understood in  any other way except by using negations.105 The implication of the doctrine of unknowability of the Trinity, which also  concerns the portrayal of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, becomes clearer  in relation to Dionysius’s teaching on the role of symbols adopted by Palamists.  Dionysius believed that visible symbols fill the earthly hierarchy, which  being dissimilar to God, are superior forms of representation of his essence.106  Symbols, signs and images have an important role in the hierarchical system  of the spiritual ascent or ‘uplifting’ of man to God, according to Dionysius.  The visual elements are furthermore valuable  in the graded system of descent or kataphasis, or transmission of mystical  knowledge from God to man through the terrestrial and celestial realms. This  is the process of ‘illuminations’ or advanced ‘light-giving’ photodosia received  through the faculty of sight.107 Certainly, Dionysius did not concern himself  with pieces of art, such as icons, but rather with the fundamental question of  knowledge of God.108 99  A.

In this context, the assumption of early Christians regarding the  so-called logoi of creation should not be overlooked, mainly within the framework  of natural knowledge of God (phisiki theory). This concept refers to the mystical  contemplation of the logoi of creation, leading to knowledge of the Logos and  ultimately the Holy Trinity.110 The importance of this doctrinal assumption is  the fact that human beings, on account of their ‘logical constitutions’, are able,  through contemplation of things in their logoi, to keep the created universe  together and to refer it to its primary cause.111 Hence, according to Maximus,  the revelations of God given to the saints, as well as the Old Testament visions  of him, are perceivable signs of his divine presence, yet never revealing his  essence. Maximus thought that the true contemplatives, like Abraham, are able  to perceive the three angelic forms as a symbolic representation of the Trinity.112  In the same way, the iconographers who attempt to portray the Trinity seek  to accentuate God’s transcendence and, at the same time, show their ability  to perceive him according to their level of perfection.113 Rublev followed the  same principle in his icon of the Trinity. The three angels are identified by their  attitudes and meaningful gestures as the three hypostases (the Father, the Son  and the Holy Spirit); they are dissimilar while being almost identical.114 Although many contemporary scholars agree that Rublev’s icon does not  represent the narrative of Genesis 18 in historical terms, but instead shows the  divine council of the Trinity, there is a discrepancy in their views over the  designation of the three angels. Ouspensky115 and Lazarev116 understood the  middle angel to be Christ and the left angel to be God the Father. Golubstov,117  109 J.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  Demina and Vetelev were in favour of taking the middle angel to be God the  Father while Christ was the angel on the left. Ainalov believed the middle angel  represented God the Father, the left one was Christ, and the right one was the  Holy Spirit.118 Lebedev offered three options for reading the Old Testament  Trinity of Rublev.119 First, the three angels represent the three hypostases of the  Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Secondly, Genesis 18 was a vision of Jesus  Christ as God accompanied by two angels. Finally, the three angels represent  the ‘image and likeness’ of the Holy Trinity. This interpretation was based on  the inscription found in the so-called Zyrian ‘Trinity’ (Fig. 54) from Vologda’s  Cathedral (1395), commonly credited to Stephen of Perm, a disciple of Sergius of  Radonezh. This model is often used to help with identifying each of three angels  in Rublev’s icon of the Trinity. Although researchers claim Stephen of Perm  provided an inscription on each of the three angels in the Zyrian Trinity, a closer  examination reveals the inscription, located in the centre of the composition,  refers to the Trinity at large. The issue regarding the designation of the three angels was resolved during the  Council of Stoglav in 1551. The canons of this council state that the hypostasis  of the Father is on the left, and the house behind him symbolises the house of  creation. His hand points to the chalice, calling the Son to take upon himself  the work of salvation. Christ is the central angel, and the tree behind him  represents the cross and the redemptive work of God the Son. His head is  bowed gently to the Father, indicating total and faithful obedience. To see God  the Father is impossible (John 1:18), ‘because people cannot see Him and live’  (Exodus 33:20). Only the Son gives this opportunity: ‘No one comes to the  Father except through me’ (John 14:6). The Holy Spirit is on the right side. He  is the comforter, the Paraclete, witnessing the holy act of divine self-dedication. Whether any of these hypotheses can be taken as valid is difficult to ascertain;  however, the various definitions reflect the failure of the Eastern and Western  church to resolve their diverging views on Trinitarian theology during the  hesychast controversy. Palamists condemned the filioque clause and affirmed  the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone.120 Palamists believed filioquism  invalidated the appropriate antinomy between Monad and Triad. Moreover, it  stripped the three hypostases of their concrete properties and turned God into  abstract essence. The Western church underscored the consubstantiality of God,  leading to a neglect of inter-hypostatic differences. The followers of hesychasm,  118 A.

The Chalcedonian and post-Chalcedonian Christological doctrine  grounded on the doctrine of the hypostatic union of two natures in Christ  served as a conceptual basis for the hesychast refutation of the Western concept  of the Trinity.121 In turn, the dogma of hypostatic union of divine and human  natures in Christ, as well as the patristic doctrine of hoomousios gave support  to hesychast teaching, implying that the divine life is accessible only through  deification of the body of Christ and participation in the sacraments. To support  their claim, the hesychasts referred to Gregory the Theologian and John of  Damascus,122 both of whom defended the conceptual difference between the  three hypostases in the Trinity.123 The hesychastic focus on the hypostatic  difference of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit informed the iconography  of the Old Testament’s Trinity as clearly indicated in Rublev’s icon.124 Guided by a conviction of the need for and benefit of love, Rublev emphasised  the unity of the Godhead and reaffirmed the hypostatic difference of the Father,  the Son and the Holy Spirit. He adorns the three angels with iconographic  characteristics to point their different functions within the Trinity.125 The first angel, shown at the left, is vested in a blue undergarment. His light- purple outer garment attests to his unfathomable nature and royal dignity and  his demeanour reflects this fatherly authority. The expression on his face and  the position of his head and hands, his gaze aimed at the two other angels and  the way he is sitting, point to the hypostasis of the Father. The eyes of the two other angels are turned attentively toward the first angel,  as though conversing with him about the salvation of humanity. The central  angel wears blue outer robes signifying his divinity and celestial nature.  His dark-crimson undergarment symbolises the incarnation.126 The second angel  is Christ, the Son of God.127 The light blue undergarment and the smoky-green  outer garment, representing heaven and earth, suggest the angel on the right is  the Holy Spirit. By him, every soul that lives ascends in purity. The mountain  above the third angel indicates this advancement, assisted by the power of the  divine grace. 121  Dulskis, ‘Hesychast Ideas’. 122  John of Damascus, ‘Homily of the Transfiguration’, in H.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  Apart from Rublev having adorned his three angels with individual  characteristics128 he also placed them in a circle to allude to the doctrine of the  mutual relations of the three hypostases in the Trinity.129 Both the models of Rublev’s Trinity and the conversational relationship of the  three angels express the notion of unity and divine oneness of the Trinity.130  As a qualitative category, the unity of the Trinity is expressed in various ways.  For example, Rublev eliminates the concept of time from this icon, showing  the essence of time—eternity. The differentiation between the images of the  three angels affirms the notion of Trinitarian unity.131 The three angels differ in  postures and gestures, but a circular rotation embraces their bodies in a dance,  which if sped up will blur the distinctions between them. Finally, the placement  of Christ at the centre of the icon also creates the sense of unity and allows the  observer to meditate on the nature of the Trinity. Without the participation  of the Father and the Holy Spirit, Christ would have been unable to fulfil his  salvific act of humanity. Formal qualities of Rublev’s icon of the Trinity The movement in Rublev’s Trinity is described with attention to the icon’s  properties of quietness, gentleness, anxiety, and sorrow; or the mood permeating  the icon, which is often described as detached, meditative, contemplative,  intimate, gentle and direct. The image of the middle angel, however, from whom  all movement proceeds is invested with a note of sovereignty, independence  and strength. Thus, Rublev’s Trinity produces a lyrical aura of harmony and  quietness while simultaneously it conveys the rhythmic movement of an  unstoppable power.132 The figures of the three angels are almost symmetrical, and seem frozen in  deep spiritual peace, a holy calm assuming an inward movement.133 The mirror  symmetry on the opposing sides of the icon reflects stability and equilibrium.134  The outlines on the back of the left and right angels coincide exactly, although  128  Gregory the Theologian, Oratio 29, 16; Patrologia Graeca 36, 96. 129  Nikephoros, ‘Logos’ 18, 19, in Patrologia Graeca 100, 584–790; 580–581; Nikephoros, ‘Epistula ad  Leonem III Papam’, in Patrologia Graeca 100, 170–206; 181–184. 130  C.

The mountain and the building are  also symmetrically positioned. Parallel lines emerge, vanishing and re-emerging  at different points, but in the same direction, drawing all elements of the icon,  including buildings, the three angels and the rock into the flow of forms.135  Against the symmetry and equilibrium of the group, a movement starts from  the Father, with two counter movements bringing the second and the third  person back to the first. A movement proceeds from the back of the Father’s  shoulders, which is directed towards the middle angel and the angel on the left.  This motion is strengthened by the location of the emblematic house. A counter  movement starts from the foot of the Father and gains momentum as it passes  through the posterior of the Spirit, lingers over the hands of the central angel  and the angel on the right and finally comes to rest in the Father.136 The Son and  the Holy Spirit carry within them, by implication, the entire creation, including  the onlooker, in return to the Father. Hence, though Rublev concentrated on the  inverted perspective and expressed eternity by excluding earthly movement,  the three figures create the perfect movement of love.137 While the Father places one of his hands atop the other, the hands of the Son  and the Holy Spirit are apart. It confirms the traditional viewpoint that the Son  and the Holy Spirit represent the two modes of operation of the Father. The  Son responds to the Fathers’ calling by consenting to perform the assigned act  of incarnation, so the action of his movement expresses love and obedience.138  He bows his head to the right, in the direction of the first angel. Alpatov  noted the elevation of the left knee of the middle angel, whereas his right knee  remains in place. Clearly, the middle angel gets up and follows the guidance  of the first angel.139 Moreover, the rising stance of this angel portrays his  descent into the world and his commitment to the redemptive work of sacrifice.  The act of salvation of humanity commences from the Father, it is followed by  the Son, continues in the Holy Spirit before returning to the Father. The circular  movement reaches a degree of climax in the middle angel. The two angels conceal  signs of firmness under the all-pervading beauty of the image, and the icon  reflects their free will and consistent and full implementation of their decisions.  The fact the three angels epitomise one other alludes to the hesychast theology  of synergia, as well the doctrinal concept of perichoresis (mutual indwelling of  each person of the Trinity within the Godhead).140 135  D.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  The first angel sits more front-on than the rest. In addition to the gesture of  his blessing, the rod of the first angel is pushed forward, while the rods of the  second and the third angel are bent.141 His hands are also close to each other,  which reflects self-discipline and focus. The image of God the Father is powerful,  not just relative to the Son, but also in regards to the Holy Spirit. The Father  aims his gesture of blessing at the second, and the third angel. The posture of  the third angel on the right reflects the greatest peace and concentration, even a  certain looseness and softness. His rod rests on his shoulder, and its lower part  rests against the outside of his right thigh, not between the knees. This position  conveys thoughtful, leisurely reflection.142 In contrast to the general peace coming from the third angel, the position of his  wings is dynamic. If the wings of the first and the second angel are smooth, the  wings of the third angel suggest movement in varying degrees. The rise of the  left wing transfers the viewer’s eye to the mountain to express a spiritual uplift  that complements the symbolism of spiritual rest.143 The states of motion and  rest in the third angel show predominantly through symbols. On the contrary,  the motion in the central angel is expressed by discrete forms, such as the form  of his wings which are almost flattened in opposition.144 The Father’s wings  overlap those of the Son and the wings of the Spirit and the Son touch each  other without overlapping. Thus, the Father generates the Son and causes the  Spirit to proceed while the Spirit reposes in the Son but proceeds from the  Father alone. The three viewpoints of the icon are represented by the left angel to the right,  the right angel to the left and the middle to the front. The two angels on the  side present opposite points of view, which leads to an inverted perspective  of the communion table. Since the size of this table is inadequate to the space,  Rublev placed its sides behind the knees of angels.145 The background is larger  than the foreground, and the chalice pushes to the outer end of the traprezoid  table, a feature that is repeated in the podium. The trapezoid form is the result  of the unfolding of the surfaces of a regular square form, of which only the  rear parts are lost in the representation. The process of unfolding is visible in  the chairs and further denotes recession. The use of the reverse perspective  takes the observer inside the icon, allowing him to experience a vision of the  Trinity outside historical parameters. The icon provides the viewer with a visual  representation of the otherwise hidden Holy Secret.146 141  Opie, ‘The Trinity in Andrei Rublev’s Icon’, 202–209. 142  Deminа, Андрей Рублев и Художники его Круга (Moscow 1963) 48. 143  Titz, ‘Some General Features’. 144  Observations on geometry are based on Voloshinov, ‘The Old Testament Trinity’. 145  A.

In the two-dimensional  perspective, positioning the second angel represents the natural centre,  in respect of the assured symmetry of the first and third angels. Following the  laws of three-dimensional perspective, however, the fact that the image of the  middle angel is higher on the pictorial plane corresponds to the equal position  of angels in real space.147 Nevertheless, Rublev shifts the centre of gravity close  to the angel on the left by turning the head of the middle angel in the direction  of the left angel. The diagonals of the icon are, at the same time, diagonals of the arc. As a result,  there is no difference if the proportions of the composition of the figurative scene  are calculated on the inner outline (the outline of the arc) or on the outer, that is,  the contour of the whole icon. There is an unlimited scale of golden proportions  relative to the centre of Rublev’s icon.148 For any point inside the circle,  a parallel point on the opposite side is found, that is to say, in golden proportion  to the given point.149 The icon has a harmonious proportion, expressed in the  silhouettes of the three figures on the surface of the board.150 This ideal ratio of  angels can be likened to the equality of angles in a triangle.151 Rublev’s placement of the three angels onto an implicit circle is a key innovation,  as is the placement of the chalice at the centre of the composition.152 The aesthetic  of the circle, with a higher degree of perfection, led Pythagoras to develop the  hypothesis of the circular trajectory of planetary orbits. Different cultures have  used the circle as a symbol for the sky and everything lofty, eternal and close to  God. The cycle was always viewed as an expression of eternity and everlasting  love, as noted by Dionysius.153 The circular movement signifies that God remains  identical with himself and that he envelops (creation) in synthesis and recalls to  himself all that has gone forth from him.154 The hesychast meditation technique  is also circular: God flows out to humanity and gives knowledge of him, and  humanity responds, through the mind and body, to his call.155 147  P.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  Rublev’s icon is inscribed in three circles: the circle of the faces, the arms and  wings of the angels on the side, and the arms of the angel in the middle and the  central chalice.156 Interestingly, not one but three manifestations of a chalice  emerge. The first chalice is the sacrificial faith offering of Abraham to the  three angels who visited his house. The second is God’s sacrifice in Christ for  humanity (the Eucharist). The third is the chalice of the Trinity, in which the  whole Trinity participates in the salvation of humanity.157 Most art historians locate circles at the centre of the icon using the golden  rectangle. These circles form concentric rings connecting the face of the left  angel with the hand of right one, and the face of the angel in the middle with  the chalice. When looking at the middle angel within the circle, it becomes clear  the he neither suppresses nor dominates the other angels, although he appears  to be placed higher than they are. Ungureanu’s description of the composition’s  three circles is different.158 He interprets the circle inscribed in the rectangle  that corresponds to the painted surface of the Holy Trinity icon as the circle  of the Son. The green circle, inscribed between the horizontals obtained by  connecting the small sides of the square, is the circle of the Holy Spirit. When  the circle of the Holy Spirit doubles with the light of his radius, the circle of  the Father is obtained. The chord obtained from the intercession of the circles  is the side of an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle of the Holy Spirit.  The circle in this triangle is the circle of the Father. The grace circle that inscribes  the square within the icon is the one which gives form and dimension to the  representation of the Holy Trinity.159 The position of the sceptres in the hands  of the three angels, however, determines the problem of geometrical space.160 The circular movement alludes to the doctrine of perichoresis. It is precisely  because the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit unite in the Trinity161 that  Rublev gives the same characteristics to each of them, distinguishing them by  postures, the colours of their robes and spatial positions. A dynamic pattern  of rotational symmetry connects the three angels.162 Their round dance is  charmingly depicted in Rublev’s icon where the dogma of perichoresis involves  ‘making room’, at the centre of the Hospitality. The artist has created a space  that enfolds, yet permits discernment. Hence, this icon makes a room for the  observer, and offers hospitality to him as a fourth guest. The Trinity is like the  centre of the cosmos, and the centre of the Trinity is the chalice featured in the  centre of the table.  156 Snyman, ‘In the Gaze of God’, 35–57, 20–22. 157 Alpatov, ‘La Valeur Classique de Rublev’, 30–37. 158 Ungureanu, ‘Dialogue between Sphere and Cube’, 83–90. 159 Voloshinov, ‘The Old Testament Trinity’. 160 D.

This feature alludes to the sacrificial act of God in history. The inside of the  second angel’s garment is blue on the shoulder and reappears under the table,  at the third angel’s feet.164 This alludes to the Spirit continuing the work of  Christ. The blue of the third angel is visible at his centre and shines through  within, as whitish and bluish highlights, and also suffuses his other garments.  Used in this manner, azure and blue summarise the outer and inner action of  two other angels, giving the icon a serene, shimmering and unearthly beauty.165  It also signifies Christ’s historical manifestation of the uncreated light that he  shares with the Father.166 This corresponds to the ontological position of the  three hypostases of the Trinity, which are hoomousios (of the same substance)  with each other.167 The chalice is also a symbol of providence, by which God  realises all in all and embodies his essential self-sameness and immovability.168 Just like the circles, three octagons emerge when a circumference touches the  horizontal sides of the arc of the icon. The smallest octagon includes the focal  point of the composition, that is, the chalice and the arms stretching towards it.  The middle octagon involves the central elements of the scene — the angels and  the sacrificial chalice and finally, the largest octagon embraces all elements of the  figurative scene with mathematical precision. It mirrors the slopes of the angels’  thrones and pedestals, the axonometric axis of the left building, and even the  tangent of the right mountain.169 The octagon reflects a hesychast concept of the  eighth day or Parousia as affirmed by the 12th-century mystic, Symeon the New  Theologian. He held the cosmic week of seven millennia culminates in the age  of Christ. He has already, in time, mystically inaugurated the eighth day of the  new creation beyond time. According to Symeon, the coming of the Lord has  already taken place, and the revelation of divinity became, in fact, a judgment  for those to whom it is revealed.170 The abundant use of gold, golden-yellow and golden-greenish for the background  and fields, for the angel’s wings, low seats and foot rests, for the walls and  ceiling and the chalice, imparts to the icon a serene, shimmering, unearthly  163  Hunt, ‘Andrei Rublev’s Old Testament Trinity Icon: Problems of Meaning, Intertextuality, and  Transmission’, A Journal of Russian (Religious) Thought, vol. 7–12 (2002–2007) 15–46. 164  Ungureanu, ‘Dialogue between Sphere and Cube’, 82–96. 165  Alpatov, ‘On the Global Significance of Andrey Rublyov’s Art’, Khudozhnik, vol. 12 (1980) 48–57.  166  V.G.

Rublev also used the technique of scumbling; that  is softening the outlines or colour by applying thin coats of opaque colour.  The result is the three heavenly visitors are transfigured like a luminous cloud.  Rublev’s contemporaries called it dymon pisano; e.g., transparent like smoke.171  The clothing of the left angel reveals Rublev’s mastery of the scumbling  technique; shining through the delicate pink-purplish tone of the himation, the  reflection of light on the edges on the folds enlightens the blue of his tunic.172 Rublev offered other puzzles in the form of recessed colour, light and shadows.  The two most intense areas in the image are the black doorways of the house  above the angel on the left. These are much darker than the cloak of the central  figure or the chalice, which is the focal point of the composition.173 The two  optical mysteries match one another in the foreground: the absence of shadow  in the recess made in the table below the chalice.174 As the shadows change  according to position, to be in all positions at once is to see no shadow.  ‘The lack of the contrast of shadow and light in the depiction of icon figures  refers to individuals who are psychologically fully integrated’.175 As many other  14th- and 15th-century Russian painters did before him, Rublev made the rare  appearance of shadows an expression of the uncreated light, the light that does  not come from a particular place but rather comes from the Godhead who resides  in all places at once. The light of celestial objects, such as the sun or other stars,  is subject to variation, whereas the uncreated light of God has no variations.176  This feature represents the uncreated light manifested to the apostles at the  Transfiguration on Mt Tabor. The saints perceive this light during prayer.  The iconographers represented it in the shape of a halo or mandorla in art.  The light seen at the Transfiguration is also the ‘light of the Parousia’.177 Rublev’s icon of the Trinity in the context of  15th- and 16th-century art Rublev’s Trinity is amongst the greatest achievements of Russian art. Crowning  the extensive artistic career of a master, it was also the epitome of the ingenious  thought of numerous authors.178 Like any other medieval artist, Rublev  171  Golunstov, ‘Икона Живоначальной Троицы’. 172  Chaillot, ‘Contemplating Rublev’s Icon’. 173  S.

A method of theoretical generalisation,  outwardly abstract, but with a remarkably tangible content, an aptitude to  affirm through symbolic images the domestic character, as well as the creative  expertise attaining to the zenith of world art combined in Rublev’s icon.  So pronounced was Rublev’s reputation that the 1551 Church council, held in  Moscow,179 recommended that all icon painters must follow Rublev’s canon of  painting, and use ancient images painted by Greek iconographers and Rublev  as models.180 Rublev abandoned many features that made explicit reference to the text of  Genesis 18: Abraham and Sarah are missing, and there are no utensils on the  table. In Rublev’s innovative reinterpretation of the Biblical text, there is no  praise of Abraham’s hospitality; rather, the purpose of the icon is to express  the psychological idea of unity as well as the undivided nature of the Father,  the Son and the Holy Spirit.181 Such dogmatical issues were often explored by Rublev’s spiritual teacher  Sergius, who brought the tradition of the hesychast-style of contemplation to  Russia. He took the veneration of the Trinity as a sign of the unity of celestial  and terrestrial realms, and the unity of heavenly and earthly hierarchy and of the  Church. The unity of the Trinity was a symbol of the unity of both Testaments,  enshrined in the Russian national consciousness. Sergius adhered to the mystical tradition of hesychasm.182 He received visions  of the Trinity, of the divine light and of the Theotokos and these revelations  inspired works praising the cult of the Trinity. An important composition is  the Apparition of the Virgin to Sergius of Radonezh (Fig. 55) which depicts the  vision of the mother of God, accompanied by the apostles Peter and John,  promising to watch over the monastery. An extant example, from the Trinity  Lavra of St Sergius, is kept at the Museum of Art at the University of Oregon.183  That Sergius’s vision matches Abraham’s vision of the three angels in the Old  Testament is important for three reasons: the artwork affirms the special affinity  that the saint had with the Trinity, it asserts the importance of the Virgin Mary  in the economy of salvation,184 and it attests to the iconographer’s preoccupation  with the uncreated light of God.185 179  E.B.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  In the later versions of this icon, the image of the Hospitality of Abraham is  placed above the figure of the Virgin (Genesis 18). This feature is evidence of  the connection between this image and Rublev’s icon. In turn, the likenesses  between Rublev’s Trinity and the Apparition of the Virgin point to the influence  of Sergius’s spiritual teaching on Rublev. Clearly, there are iconographic  differences in both models that are reflected in the positions assumed by the  righteous welcoming their celestial visitors in the icon of the Apparition,186  as well as the number of chalices depicted. Instead of one chalice, as found in  Rublev’s Trinity, three chalices are placed on the table. The three chalices evoke  God’s transcendence as a self-identity, which paradoxically exceeds its limits in  interaction with another being. As a result, one knows its ontological nature,  its inner being in God.187 Furthermore, the combination of stillness and motion  communicates the essential oneness of the Trinity, the centre of the hesychast  response to Barlaam’s definition: that God’s transcendence is unknowable by  definition.188 The shape of the circle represents a communion of angels united  in hesychia, the ideal monastic community which Sergius wished to establish. A new icon of the Trinity from the Trinity Sergius’s Lavra (Fig. 56), created about  the same time as Rublev’s Trinity, affirms the doctrines of Sergius, paralleling  Palamas’s teachings on the Uncreated Light189 as well as with Iosif Volotsky’s  tradition of безмолвие.190 As this icon belongs to Sergiev’s Posad, it is possible its  creator and Rublev were in the same monastic community, working together on  the decoration of the stone church of the Trinity.191 Providing a vision of the Old  Testament Trinity, both icons are almost identical. Rublev, however, overcome  the inherent difficulties artists faced when depicting the consubstantial and  indivisible nature of the Trinity.192 The unknown painter of the Trinity icon  from the Trinity Sergius’s Lavra, on the other hand, reflects a patristic-liturgical  interpretation of Genesis 18, which perceives all Old Testament theophanies  as manifestations of the Word.193 In the earlier depiction of the Trinity, the  central angel has a note of sovereignty, independence and strength, whereas  the ontological distinction between other two hypostases of the Trinity is not  clearly affirmed. The left and the right angel are distinguished with features  such as drapery and the colour of the clothes. Subtle changes undercut the  186  While Abraham and Sarah are not represented in Rublev, they assume an almost liturgical function in  the icon of the apparition. 187  Plugin, ‘Мастер Святой Троицы’, 325. 188  Hunt, ‘Andrei Rublev’s Old Testament Trinity Icon’, 103. 189  D.M.

The landscape features in the icon of the Trinity from  the Monastery of Sergius of Radonezh are large and define the structure of the  piece on the high–low axis. The peripheral mountain and the church form the point of two spirals, beginning  with the side angels and continuing with the cross shared between the central  angel and the bowl (on the central axis) in the foreground, and the tree in the  background.194 The spirals point to the profound and beautiful interconnection  between creator and creatures. The form of a spiral symbolises the process of  moving outward and remaining still, thus yielding a curve so that ‘created  nature may return to God once again’ (916D, 119).195 The spiral on the left moves  through the red colour of the middle angel’s garment continuing to Sarah and  finishes on the tilted axis formed by the central angel’s head. The other spiral  starts with the blue garments of the angel on the right continues to Abraham and  then goes back around the church (with blue balustrades and a blue roof). The  interlocking peaks of the spirals make the path of the cross join the chalice with  Christ.196 Instead of an inward movement towards greater fullness and inclusion,  which symbolises the Trinitarian unity, the upward-facing bowls delineate  the ascetic path.197 The crossing paths of two spirals also create a circle that  frames the torso of the Christ–angel and mirrors the circle of the central bowl.  A larger circle enclosing the five figures mirrors the smaller circle and embodies  a broader revolution of the same spiral.198 To reveal the power of the Eucharist,  the circles are taken upwards, which is evidence of the Resurrection.199  This unique expression of God fully captures the imagination of the worshipper,  in bringing the mind into a deeper sense of God. It is in this way that the minds  of the worshippers, of the many, are brought back towards the understanding of  the ‘one’, as suggested in Neoplatonic philosophy. The sign of the number seven  in two sets of filigree circles as well as in the placement of seven fluted partitions  in the cupola symbolises the divine energies and the Trinity revealing the Monad  in the Triad.200 Through the interaction of the Spirit with the other two persons,  194  I am indebted to P.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  the Father and the Son, the Trinity exists and dominates Christian theology.  It is with the reinterpretation of the Dionysius’s neoplatonic triadic manifestations  of God, however, that there was a deeper understanding of the Christian Trinity  in the early Church.201 The three angels having the same proportions, size and  the same unmarked halo, proves the interaction of the Father, the Son and the  Holy Spirit. Their circular interrelation, symbolising an inward attachment and  communion reflects the gestures and postures of the three angels. This circular  pattern differs from the spiral because it is not placed directly between the  worshipper and icon. The circular motion of the soul moves in on itself, then  outwards, towards the rest of the members.202 The mixture of red and gold dominates this icon, making the image a different  visual experience for the viewer than Rublev’s Trinity. The Trinity from the  Monastery of St Sergius emphasises the symbolism of love, blood and the fire  of martyrdom, confirmed by the use of red. The symbolism of the number  seven presents the completeness and perfection achieved through participation  in the spiritual fire of Christ (Proverbs 6:16–1; 9:1). This, in turn, alludes to  the work of the Holy Spirit that began after the Pentecost.203 The association  of this icon with the Pentecost verifies the hesychast stand against filioquism:  it shows the presence and manifestation of the Holy Spirit within the Church,  inspiring unity, worship and service. It also places the feast of the Pentecost  in eternal rather than temporal parameters, announcing ontological truths that  would be fully accessible in the ‘age to come’. This new iconography of the  Holy Trinity, which appeared in Byzantium in the 14th century, and was later  reflected in Rublev’s Trinity, became widespread in Russia, where the Church  already celebrated the feast of the Trinity.204 Other causes, which were at work simultaneously with the increase of hesychasm  on Russian soil, affected the spread of Rublev’s model of the Trinity in Russia.  The anti-Trinitarian currents, which began to grow and spread in Russia during  the 14th and 15th centuries, are worth noting.205 The heretical sects in Russia,  notably those of the 14th century, which are a direct continuation Bogomil and  Cathar doctrines, rejected Trinitarian and Christological dogma.206 Moreover, the  sect of Strigolniki and of the Judaizers, which appeared in Pskov and Novgorod  in the 14th century and were indirectly connected to Bogomilism, renounced  201  Luibheid &amp; Rorem, Dionysius the Areopagite, 149. 202  J.K.N Hedrick, ‘Visual Constructions in the Reign of Justinian: A Neo-Platonic Influence’, Journal of  History and Social Science (Spring 2010) 5–19. 203  Hunt, ‘Andrei Rublev’s Old Testament Trinity Icon: Problems of Meaning, Intertextuality, and  Transmission’, 20. 204  ibid., 21. 205  N.A.

Substantiating this point, these  heretical sects came, finally, to a denial of the possibility of the image of the  Trinity.207 The spread of anti-Trinitarian currents generated a response from  visual artists of this period. The increased production of Trinitarian Paternitas  compositions, as well as images of the Old Testament Trinity (of Rublev’s type) in  the 14th and 15th centuries, demonstrates this fact. The anti-sectarian sentiment  reflected in the spread of the cult of the Trinity in Russia during this period.  A church feast was dedicated to the Trinity and was prominent in the provinces  of Novgorod and Pskov.208 In the religious and philosophical sense, these images  as well as architectural objects aimed to represent the Christian ideal of life on  earth, opened the way for the removal of dilemma — national or universal.209 A significant example of the Trinity from Rostov is representative of the way  in which many artists from this region used Rublev’s Trinity as a model for  their paintings. In comparison to the hesychast type of Trinity exemplified by  Rublev’s icon, however, the new version of the Trinity emerging in Rostov and  Pskov was created as a response to the acute anti-Trinitarian controversies in  Russia. The Rostov type of Trinity has its own characteristics and aim, showing  the hypostatic equality of the three hypostases of the Trinity and their unity in  the single image of the Trinity. Hence, the new version of the Trinity surfaces  with three angels seated in one row of a rectangular table; their heads placed  strictly on the same level (Fig. 57). The anti-heretical role of the image is further  affirmed by the use of two other iconographical features; the gesture of blessing  of the three angels is the same and they all have crucifixes on haloes inscribed  with a monogram of Christ.210 This testifies to the probability that Pskov’s school  of painting fought against heresy by incorporating the characteristics of the  Greek iconographic tradition of the ‘Hospitality of Abraham’ and combining  them with those of the Russian tradition for representation of the Trinity.  The use of the horizontal axis of the image of the angels, pillows on the seats,  and the representation of rounded vessels points to Greek influence.211 The  model of Pskov incorporates many elements of symmetry from Russian artists.  The three angels sit in the same position and the Eucharistic meal on the table  forms a strong horizontal line. Simple details, such as the uneven texture and  the abundance of gold decorations, suggest the painting is from the start of the  15th century. Other archaic features, such as the rectangular table, point to the  iconographic tradition from the last quarter of the 14th century. 207  ibid., 20. 208  N.K.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  The placement of the angels around the square table repeats the oriental  type212 of the Trinity icon of Novgorod (15th century), which is currently held  at the Museum of History of Moscow (Музей истории Москвы) (Fig. 58).213  The wings of the central angel are fully opened to produce movement beyond  the composition. Implements on the table, large background features, and the  figures of Abraham and Sarah, allude semantically to the historical presence  of God. Three chalices are on the elongated table, with no shroud on it.  The rhomboid shape of the bowl has no precedent.214 The central angel is Christ the Logos (he has a crucifix on his halo), but the  main feature of Rublev’s Trinity is not lost, as neither the Father nor the Spirit  bear separate characteristics. Placed within a circle, the three angels refer to the  Trinity as a whole, affirming the mutual indwelling of the Father, the Son and the  Holy Spirit. Colours are restrained and warm and not as bright and transparent  as in Rublev’s Trinity. The composition is closer to the pictorial plane due to the  emphatic treatment of the background. In comparison to the mystical meaning of  Rublev’s icon of the Trinity, the Trinitarian image from the Museum of History,  Novgorod, affirms the realistic dimension of human salvation. While the hesychast influence on Russia narrowed after 1504, and outward  ritualistic monasticism replaced the teachings of Sergius and Nil Sorsky,215  the movement’s importance for Russian spirituality should not be underestimated  (Figs 59, 60, 61). The spread of hesychasm and the interchange between the Byzantine and Russian  traditions reflected in the art of Mt Athos, resulted in paintings reflecting an  intermingling of Russian and Byzantine style. Rublev painted his icon under  the direct influence of Byzantine icons from Athos, where the cult of the Trinity  existed before the 15th century. The icon of the Trinity from the Monastery of  Vatopedi on Mt Athos (Fig. 62) and from the Byzantine Museum, Athens, attests  to this fact. It is possible that the Vatopedi icon served as a prototype, due to the  close associations between the monastic communities of the Trinity Sergeus’s,  Lavra, and those of Mt Athos, beginning in the time of Sergius and Metropolitan  Cyprian.216 The icon of the Trinity from the Monastery of Vatopedi, painted at  the end of the 14th century, also attests to the widespread representation of  the new hesychast iconography of the Holy Trinity, which first appeared in  the miniature manuscript of Parisinus Graecus 1242 from 1375. Moreover, this  variant alludes to the divine presence within history. It elaborates the Biblical  212  Malickii, ‘Панагия Русского Музея с Изображением Троицы’, Материалы по Русскому Искусству,  vol. 1 (St Petersburg 1928) 34. 213  V.N.

The table and larger background features  allude to Abraham’s dwelling, the Oak of Mamre and Abraham and Sarah.217  The Trinity of Vatopedi also emphasises Christ with his two messengers; which  is a good expression of the sacramental mystery of the sacrifice of the Mass, for  which Christ’s incarnation is a precondition.218 Moreover, the icon’s exegesis  affirms the power of the Eucharist in offering communion in the resurrection  and descent of the Spirit. Finally, this icon also alludes to the Pentecost, while  observing Christological parameters. The middle angel exhibits the traditional  attributes of Christ the Logos. His figure and his wings are larger than the wings  of the two other angels, his clothing shines, and he wears a cruciform nimbus.  The middle angel is flanked by two other, smaller, angels.219 The central angel  serves as a centre to the symmetrical background features. While his right arm  gestures at a large central bowl, his two messengers on either side of the table  gesture towards two smaller bowls. Sarah and Abraham incline in an attitude  of reverence and prayer towards the middle angel. They co-participate with the  side angels who are blessing their respective bowls.220 Abraham and Sarah take  the priestly role by conversing with the angels (who are inserted between them).  In response, the central angel turns to the side; he no longer raises his hand in  blessing, but rather indicates with a benedictory gesture the chalice in front of  him. The side angels are active participants; while the one on the right reaches  out for the piece of bread or the vessel, the one on the left blesses the table.  The architectural setting behind the angels is richly decorated. A unique feature  is the portrayal of Abraham’s tent as a cupola-like structure with seven divisions.  This shows possible influence on the Vatopedi icon by the composition Wisdom  has Built her House.221 The symbolism of the seven pillars of Wisdom’s house asserts the energy of the  Spirit and the gifts of grace, such as knowledge, prudence, sound judgement,  counsel, understanding and power. The Vatopedi icon upholds the symbolism  of the number seven as the sign of the completion of God’s initial creative act. While Rublev’s Trinity shows God’s manifestation in the Church, the Vatopedi  icon offers a cogent analogia relationis between the creator and the creatures.  The new iconography of the Holy Trinity created during the hesychast  controversy was entrenched in the tradition of Athos, preserving the same  iconographic qualities after several centuries (Fig. 63). The placement of the feet  of the left angel (the Father) are always deployed along the entire edge of the  217  Hunt, ‘Andrei Rublev’s Old Testament Trinity Icon: Problems of Meaning, Intertextuality, and  Transmission’, 30–37. 218  Louth, ‘The Oak of Mamre’. 219  A.A.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  throne. The middle angel (the Son) has his hands in a gesture of blessing. On the  other hand, the hands of the right angel (the Holy Spirit) are in a sign of action.  In his Trinity, Rublev embodies many elements of the Vatopedi icon. The frequent encounters between monks and travellers from Constantinople  allowed the ideas and patterns of Byzantine civilization to pour into Russia.222  The patriarchate of Constantinople used its executive authority in vast territories,  but the elitist character of Byzantine humanism precluded any transmission of  secular Greek culture to the Slavs.223 Therefore, the great mass of translated  literature was religious (chiefly hesychastic) and ecclesiastical. It was not  uncommon to see Byzantine artists moving to Russian municipalities, especially  during times of conflict. When the hesychast controversy raged through the  Byzantine state, many Greek painters moved to Russian territories. Theophanes,  whose style was tense, expressive and full of mystical contemplation, was one  of them. The fresco of the Trinity by Theophanes is on the walls of the small chapel  dedicated to the Trinity, which forms a part of the Church of the Transfiguration,  Novgorod (Fig. 64). The composition was created in 1378 and reflects the oriental  type (Fig. 65) to which Theophanes was exposed during his frequent trips to the  East, especially to Capaddocia.224 At the bottom of the mural, Abraham and Sarah prepare the meal. At the top of  the fresco, the three angels are gathered around a semi-circular table on which  the sacrificial meal is placed. The depiction of angels is unusual, with the figure  of the central angel being expressive and higher on the pictorial plane than  the other two; he raises his right hand in blessing while holding a scroll in his  left. He has large outstretched wings that overshadow and embrace the two  other angels, dominating the painted scene. The central angel also bears a cross  nimbus and carries a scroll in his left hand; both symbols are commonly used in  reference to Christ.225 The central angel sits closer to the angel on the right than  to the one on the left; this was a common feature in the iconographic tradition  of the 11th and 12th centuries.226 The masters of that time made use of a full  circle, arranging the other angels around the central angel representing the Son.  222  The Serbian and Bulgarian influence upon cultural, religious, literary and artistic development in  Russia was also immense. The transmission of liturgical and disciplinary reforms, pilgrims journeying to  Constantinople, and artists, diplomats and ecclesiasts travelling to and from Byzantium, constitute various  channels through which ideas and patterns of Byzantine civilization poured into Russia.

Accordingly,  the haloes of the angels keep equal distance from the line of the frame from top  left to right.227 The overall background of the fresco of the Trinity, as well as the outline of the  halo, the glare on the wings, the recesses in the hair and shapes of the eyes of  the three angels are in monochrome, with bright highlights to create depth and  contour.228 The three angels have no pupils; instead, their retinas are expressed  with bright white strokes, which light their eyes like flames of fire. This recalls  the account of the Biblical story following the event of the Hospitality of  Abraham, that is, the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (Genesis 19:23). Rublev was a pupil of Theophanes, from whom he learned the technique of  iconography. Rublev, already a mature master, conducted an internal dialogue  with his predecessor and teacher. Nevertheless, the personality and the  demeanour of the pupil (Rublev) were unlike those of his master (Theophanes)  and their artistic interpretation of Genesis 18 reflects. Theophanes painted the  Old Testament story and included all the features of the Biblical text. Rublev, on  the other hand, embodies the image of the divine Trinity. Theophanes’s vision  of the Trinity is to be experienced as a poignant revelation. Rublev offered a  clear and terse vision of the Trinity belonging to the realm of divine wisdom  and contemplation.229 Theophanes created his works of art by following Byzantine models, even  though Epiphanius claimed that Theophanes did not look at any iconographical  manuals.230 As an educated philosopher and iconographer, however, he must  have known the works of contemporary theologians and artists from Byzantium  and Russia. They must have inspired him to produce brilliant paintings, such  as the fresco of the Trinity. Of particular importance for understanding the  impact of hesychasm on art, and on the development of Rublev’s Trinity, is the  double portrait miniature of John Kantacuzenos as a monk and emperor from  the theological works of Kantacuzenos (Parisinus Graecus 1242). This complex  and captivating image eloquently illustrates the life of Kantacuzenos, as well  as his theology.231 The interpretation of this image finds its full theological  revelation in the text of Kantacuzenos, namely his First Apology against Islam,  227  Popova, ‘Medieval Russian Painting and Byzantium’, in R.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  written somewhere between September 1369 and June 1370. Kantacuzenos was  the principal propagator and supporter of hesychasm during the 14th-century  controversy, and he visited Mt Athos after the victory of the hesychasts in 1375.  In a letter from 1371 to Bishop John on Cyprus, Kantacuzenos refers to Mt Athos  as a place where hesychasts reside.232 The theological works of Kantacuzenos  were popular on Mt Athos. The library of the Monastery of Hodegon,  Mt Athos, holds the original manuscript. A translation into Serbian existed in  the Monastery of Chilandar, Mt Athos.233 St Sava distributed this version in  Russia and Slavic lands.234 The miniature accompanying the tract against Islam is peculiar. It contains a  double portrait of Kantacuzenos in his imperial garb and in a monastic schema.  As a monk, Ioasaph Kantacuzenos holds a scroll with an inscription while his  raised right hand points to the three angels from the Philoxenia of Abraham.  This image belongs to Rublev’s variant of the Trinity.235 This indicates that Rublev knew this model of the Trinity and borrowed some  aspects of it. Hence, the three angels in the Parisinus Graecus 1242 match those  presented in Rublev’s Trinity. They sit around a rectangular table covered with  a green cloth. Each of the three angels wears a blue himation covered by a blue- grey chiton. The three persons of the Trinity are distinguished from each other  by individual characteristics; the central angel has cruciform halo, and the  right angel carries in his left hand a red unidentified object.236 Iconographical  novelties are the inclusion of this image of the Trinity above the double portrait  of Kantacuzenos, and the inscription found on his scroll, which reads ‘this is a  picture of the Christian God’. These features engage the image of the Trinity in a  visual polemic, providing further métier to the thesis expanded in the dogmatic  text accompanying the miniature.237 In Rublev’s Trinity, the three angels are  equals, in the Parisinus Graecus miniature, the middle angel is identified as  Christ and the Father at the same time, which has a dual significance. It refers  to Kantacuzenos’s statement that, although the Father did not appear in human  232 J.

Therefore, the halo of the Father bears the cross  in the Parisinus Graecus miniature.238 Also, the insistence on the value of this  Christological revelation meets another topic addressed by Kantacuzenos in  his Four Words against the Jews. Through his dual nature (divine and human),  Christ simultaneously revealed the hypostases of the Father and of the Holy  Spirit.239 Kantacuzenos stated that Christ deified the flesh and sanctified it  by means of the incarnation.240 Hence, the circumscription of God’s nature  manifested in Christ throughout his sub specie incarnationis (his earthly life).  This affirmation certainly bears a connection to the hesychast theology of the  Trinity, as expressed by Palamas.241 The appeal of this miniature lies precisely  in its ambiguity. The composition combines elements of the biblical narrative  of Genesis 18, the official imperial canon of portraiture, and the semi-private  Double Portrait of Emperor John Kantacuzenos (Fig. 66). Confronted by the  portrayal of the same individual, as it were, in two incarnations and surmounted  by the canonical representation of the Holy Trinity, ‘the viewer contemplates  the paradox of divine and human natures, hypostatically united in one person  of Christ’.242 Hesychastic spirituality transferred to Serbia after 1350 and it transpired through  various channels. First, the mystical movement of hesychasm emerged in Serbia  under the direction of Gregory of Sinai, as well as the multiplying of translated  patristic sources in Slavic languages. Second, the settlement of immigrant monks  from Bulgaria as well as the influence exercised by the Chilandar Monastery on  Mt Athos affected the spread of hesychasm to monasteries in Serbia.243 In terms  of the production of manuscripts, this monastery superseded Zographou, its  Bulgarian counterpart.244 Third, fostered by Athos, St Sava, a Serbian prince,  Orthodox monk and the first Archbishop of the Serbian Church, brought the  practice of hesychasm to Serbia.245 His two writings Karyes and Chilandar  238 John Kantakuzenos, ‘Contra Secam Mahometicam’, Patrologia Graeca 154, 371–692. 239 V.J.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  Typikon became a reference for the hesychastic monastic lifestyle.246 Forth, the  involvement of Stefan Dušan in Byzantine internal affairs during the period  1341–1354 was crucial to the spread of hesychasm. Finally, Prince Lazar’s  transfer of the spiritual centre of the state to Moravia, with clusters rising in  Ljubostina, Resava, Lazarica, affected the promulgation of the hesychasm in  Serbia.247 This style of representing the Trinity also spread to neighbouring  countries, such as Macedonia, as reflected in the example from the Church of St  Nikita, Banjani, Macedonia (Fig. 67). Hagiographical literature in Serbia flourished during the Palaeologan period,  when in-depth translations of the liturgical texts, as well as development of new  works of art, materialised. The Moravian school of painting was a creative and contemporary example of  the changes occurring in Serbian art of this period, reflecting a style informed by  hesychasm. The image of the Old Testament Trinity changed, bearing elements of  artistic trends of Mt Athos (Fig. 62), Cappadocia (Fig. 65) and Novgorod (Fig. 68). A mural painting of the Old Testament Trinity from the Monastery of Gračanica  (Fig. 69) reflects the style that arose in Byzantium at the beginning of 14th  century and testifies to the possible development of new artistic trends informed  by hesychasm in Serbia. The painters from Gračanica used new iconographic  and stylistic devices, as later Byzantine and Russian iconographers did, but  they gave them a different interpretation.248 The prominent feature is the  circumscription of the faces of the bema (raised platform); they are modelled  in a rough fashion and not anatomical. While the facial structure is strong, the  nose, cheeks and, sometimes, the bones of the forehead are bypassed. Details  are modelled by the play of light and shadow, and the use of colours of varying  intensity, as seen in the early Byzantine churches.249 In addition, the position of  the three angels varies from those seen in the earlier iconographic prototypes,  and also from the later versions of the Trinity, such as that of Rublev. The forms  of angels in the fresco of the Trinity at Gračanica are generous and affect the  volume of the composition. In contrast to this, in Rublev’s Trinity, the volume  is less apparent and the creases of the garments are rigid (in keeping in with the  style of the 12th century).250 At Gračanica, the figures of the angels tilt in three  different directions, whereas in Rublev they point to the same direction (the  chalice). This affirms their different roles in the economy of salvation, rather than  246  N. Velimirović, The Life of St Sava (Platina 1989) 41–49. 247  A.

Furthermore, their crossing paths form an oval shape  that frames the upper torso of Christ and mirrors the circle of the central bowl.  These spirals take the circle associated with the bowl upward and reveal the  power of the Eucharist; assuring that the icon’s allusion to the Trinity is not  merely typological. Both models of the Trinity (from Gračanica and of Rublev) employ inverted  perspective and polycentrism, but Rublev’s depth and rhythm of colours  contribute to the quality of his Trinity. Nevertheless, the main focus of the  Trinity fresco at Gračanica is the Christological doctrine of the hypostatic union  of two natures in Christ. Furthermore, the distinction between the divine essence  and energies — the basis of the hesychast controversy, served as a conceptual  framework for the Trinity in Gračanica. The triadological issue concerning the  unjustifiability of the filioque, in turn,252 introduced the notion of the wisdom of  God as a manifestation of God’s energies that are accessible to humans, though  the ousia of God remains hidden. The notion of wisdom was central to the hesychast controversy, which  motivated the development of symbolic images of Christ as the wisdom of God  in the guise of the Angel of Great Council (Isaiah 9:6). He is seated in front of  the temple with seven columns, which represent the ‘home’ of wisdom and  convey the inseparable and indivisible union between the Father, the Son and  the Holy Spirit.253 The dual meaning of wisdom as the energy of the divine and Christ, the power  and wisdom of God, as argued by patriarch Philotheus, makes a clear connection  between the two images.254 If the image emphasised the motif of the Godhead,  wisdom was the energy of the divine, and if the angel had a crucifix on the halo,  it represented the incarnate word of God. The altar frescoes, the Hospitality  of Abraham and Wisdom has Built her House in the Assumption Church of  the Monastery of Gračanica, are placed on the sides of the composition of the  Communion of the Apostles. Both paintings are likened to each other frontally and  symmetrically, in the dominant motif of the Trinity. Rublev also merged these  concepts in his Trinity.255 His Trinity is a place where contemplation and action  251  Vzdornov, ‘Новооткрытая Икона ‘Троицы’ из Троице-Сергиевой Лавры’, Троица Андрея Рублева:  Антология (Moscow 1970) 6. 252  ibid., 28. 253  Meyendorff, ‘Spiritual Trends in Byzantium in the Late Thirteenth and Early Fourteenth Centuries’,  in P.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  merge, and the creation and salvation of the world is inseparable.256 The two  frescoes at Gračanica single out the central angel as Christ–Wisdom. They share  a common hesychast idea about the manifest nature of the divine transcendence  through the hypostasis of the Logos. In the fresco of the Sophia at Gračanica,  however, the middle figure is the Angel of Great Council, officiating behind an  altar table, offering Wisdom’s feast of knowledge of the hidden Father through  communion in his Eucharistic mystical body. Depicted this way, the middle  angel represents Christ, which communicates the transcendence of the Father.  On either side of Christ, two servants make the symmetrical arrangement of the  three. The numerical symbolism of the three marks the divine completeness or  perfection, and it alludes to the triad or the Trinity. The composition reaches  fulfilment with the representation of the seven columns on the temple behind  Wisdom, which symbolise the seven gifts of the Spirit. It also refers to the New  Testament church built on Christ, which stands against ‘the house of the harlot’  (Proverbs 7:8). In the Trinity at Gračanica, conversely, the tent of Abraham is a cupola, like  structure with three divisions, which represent the different roles of the Father,  the Son and the Holy Spirit. The middle column is the largest, which suggests  that the middle angel has sovereignty. This in turn, is a figurative transmission  of the text of Proverbs 9:1–7 (Wisdom created her house) referring to Christ  as the wisdom of God who reveals the Godhead in history.257 While assessing  the influence of Rublev’s Trinity on the art of the 15th and 16th centuries,  it is important to note another work, from Serbia, which shares some of the  features commonly found in Rublev’s Trinity. The fresco, from the Monastery  of Kalenić, depicts the biblical narrative of the Wedding at Cana (Fig. 70).258  The original drawing style of master Radoslav, the mastery of colour and  chromatic effects, the bald approach in the composition of the masses and  retouching of the old iconographic schemes make this fresco one of the highest  Serbian artistic achievements. Rublev’s Trinity and the fresco of the Wedding of Cana circumscribe two  different subjects, yet they share some common elements. The Trinity is  predominantly abstract, and it contains only the essential features of the biblical  narrative of the Hospitality of Abraham. The Wedding at Cana is an elaborate  description of the Gospel’s story of the miracle embodied in realia.259 While in  Rublev’s Trinity there is only a select group of participants, chiefly, the three  angels sitting around a table on which the chalice is placed, at Kalenić there is a  256 R.

At the far corner  of the table, two elders taste the miraculous wine while the wedding celebrant  and his cohorts pay attention to Christ’s speech. An unusual feature is the groom  pricking his bride’s finger to mix her blood with his wine in token of his fidelity  (certainly a pagan component). An interesting feature is the guests dining with  forks, a practice almost unknown outside Venice during the 15th century.  The overall atmosphere in this fresco is of lyrical melancholy, tranquility and  joyful celebration. The strict equilibrium of those seated at the table is presented as in Rublev’s  example by sums: two, three, and two. The Wedding at Cana does not have the  same austere numerical symmetry as Rublev’s Trinity. Vessels in which the water  becomes wine are emphasised in composition at Kalenić.260 The table, the water  vessels and the uneven masses, which disturb the balance, interlink with the  murky exteriors of the robes of the invitees, the Virgin’s, Christ’s, the husband- to-be, and the two helpers. The central figure of Christ inclines and turns his  head slightly to the side.261 The ingenious arrangement of dark-clothed figures  creates a new symmetry that envelopes the whole composition. The contours  of the wings, the movement of the hands of the angels, and the merging of  background features converge at the epicentre of the icon, which shows the  chalice in which the sign of sacrifice is depicted.262 Against the obvious stylistic similarities and differences between both pieces,  Rublev painted his concept of the Trinity in the sphere of ideas, whereas  the painter at Kalenić aimed to represent the incomprehensible mystery of  the Eucharist in earthly terms. The artists at Kalenić depicted a wedding of  angelic youths. Accordingly, the postures and gestures of the three figures  reflect supplication and apotheosis of earthly happiness. Rublev’s Trinity, on  the other hand, represented a vision of the Trinity as perceived in the Old  Testament. It reveals the heavenly agape given by God to humanity and also  expresses the hesychast spirituality. Needless to say, a rare icon of the Wedding  at Cana painted in the Ferapontov Monastery, Russia, at the beginning of 16th  century repeats the patterns of the Serbian fresco, and even includes its poetical  components.263 These similar models, made in two different areas and without  communication, could have only one common denominator, a Byzantine centre,  as the starting point of this diffusion.264 From this survey of several frescoes  260  ibid. 261  In the fresco at Kalenic, the middle angel’s hand is no longer raised in blessing, and he makes a gesture  towards the vessel in front of him. The two angels on the side are making clear gestures in both paintings. 262  Compare the Wedding of Cana with that of the Trinity in the Monastery of Dećani, Kosovo; See fig. 72. 263  G.V.

The Icon of the Trinity by Andrei Rublev  and icons of the Old Testament Trinity, it is clear that Rublev’s Trinity is a pure  expression of the hesychast experience that he learned under the guidance of  Sergius. It also reflects a new style of art informed by hesychasm, which Rublev  learned from Theophanes, who combined the Byzantine artistic canon with the  Russian mentality. Conclusion The analysis of Rublev’s Old Testament Trinity reveals that specific symbolism  associated with hesychasm inspired and informed Rublev’s innovative  composition. Rublev combined the asceticism which characterised Russian  monasticism with the classic harmony of Byzantine iconography, and thus  maximised the proximity of the divine and the mortal.265 Among the feuds and  hostilities, Tartar raids and savagery of contemporary Russia, Rublev revealed  the indivisible, eternal, ineffable peace of the heavenly kingdom.266 Rublev’s Trinity offers a view into the spiritual state of hesychia, tranquillity  and stillness. It represents the union of God and man in theosis, when all  movement ceases.267 Reflecting a subtle hesychast worldview, Rublev’s Trinity  depicts the incarnation of the Son of God. The wondrous icon also affirms the  role of the Holy Spirit, and his mysterious, inspiring and spiritual development  of humankind. Rublev created a vision that was suitable for divine meditation,  allowing the observer to enter the uncreated light of God and experience  divine transformation. The icon became a window to the divine light as well  materialisation of God’s presence.   265 A.
