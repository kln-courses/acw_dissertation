<plain_text><page sequence="1">Honoring Ejagham Women UTE M. ROSCHENTHALER XW~ s Xestern scholars have long assumed that African masks and sculptures figure in contexts entirely dom- inated by men. Yet, in addition to the well-documented Sande society mask of Mende women (Boone 1986, Phillips 1995), less well-known women's masks have been described, such as those among the Lega and Bokyi.1 Further, sculptures used by women or made to commemorate them are by no means exceptional, although their roles have not been extensively studied. The Ejagham peoples of the Cross River area of Cameroon and Nigeria possess an especially rich variety of sculptures that honor women. My interest in the Ejagham was height- ened by my reading of Urwalddokumente (1908) by Alfred Mansfeld, a German colo- nial officer in Cameroon. I was impressed by Mansfeld's description and illustra- tions of the women's association called Ngbogha-Ndem (spelled Mboandem in his book), which erects life-size clay statues on the graves of its members (Fig. 1). The Ejagham make these figures only to commemorate women; according to Mansfeld, chiefs and other respected male elders were not so honored. By 1987-88, when I traveled to Ejagham country, the association had almost died out, and only a few elderly members could be found. In many villages, espe- cially among the Keaka Ejagham (East- ern Ejagham), however, a number of these figures could still be seen standing along the main road. I also discovered a good number of other women's associa- tions, most of them completely unac- knowledged in earlier records. I was even more surprised to learn that some of them dance with sculpted headdress- es at public festivals. The women of a number of African peoples are known to perform with sculp- 38 tures on their heads. Nevertheless, a sur- vey of the literature yields only a few pho- tographs of women wearing masks, and even fewer written references. An illustra- tion in Bangwa Funerary Sculpture (Brain &amp; Pollock 1971) shows a female dancer wearing a brightly colored mask whose face is cut out in the shape of a heart so that the dancer's face is exposed to view. There are photographs of Efik and Igbo women carrying sculptures on their heads ("Efik Dances" 1957, Acholonu 1985, Drewal 1988), but no details accom- pany them. Anita Glaze offers a more thorough description of a women's associ- ation which owns a sculpture carried by a female dancer at Senufo festivals (Glaze 1975). This practice is similar to those I found among the Ejagham (Roschenthaler 1993). As the Ejagham example will de- monstrate, women dancing with sculp- tures on their heads should be perceived as comparable to male masquerades. Men's and Women's Associations The Ejagham live in a large, sparsely populated area of the Cross River in the tropical rainforests of southwestern Cam- eroon and southeastern Nigeria. Theirs is a subsistence economy; women fish and grow crops; men hunt and are own- ers of most of the fruit trees and the small number of domestic animals. Patri- lineal in social organization, the Ejagham account for approximately 150 villages of rather small size (usually 100-500 peo- Left: 1.

Roschenthaler. pie, rarely more than 5,000). Each vil- lage is governed by a council of elders and is represented by a chief, who holds a ritual office. Social activities take place mainly in women's and men's associations or societies, the majority of which own masks or headdresses. The women's associations include Ekpa-Atu, which maintains social order and upholds women's principal laws, and whose members perform a secret dance at night; Njom-Ekpa, a graded secret associ- ation with a sculpted headdress carried by a female dancer; Egbobha, which owns a similar sculpted headdress; Belo, a secret association restricted to the Obang Ejagham (Southern Ejagham), which does not own sculptures; and Ngbogha-Ndem, a society for first-bor daughters that erects the life-size commemorative stat- ues documented by Mansfeld. There are also a number of savings and credit as- sociations for mutual help and security, the latter being more popular in areas bordering towns. These women's associations function alongside the various mask-owning 40 men's associations, which include not only several less important societies for young boys but also Angbu, the young men's secret society, and Ngbe, the grad- ed and secret Leopard society for adult men-today the most important of the men's associations. Several dance soci- eties, some with a mixed male and female membership, also exist. The old associations owning the famous skin- covered masks often found in Western collections still persist in some villages.2 In most cases an Ejagham association was founded by a specific person who is remembered when offerings are made to the society's ancestors. A mythical account of its origins may also exist. Successful associations were bought by interested neighboring villages, which thus acquired the secret knowledge and the right to perform their dances and songs. Societies spread in this way throughout the entire Cross River area along trading routes between the coast and the Cameroon Grasslands. Njom- Ekpa is still spreading to villages of the Keaka Ejagham, the Leopard society to the Grasslands. Other associations, like the men's Angbu and the women's Ekpa- Atu, are ancient, and no one remembers how they began. Ekpa-Atu is certainly one of the oldest and most fundamental of Ejagham societies, unifying all the women of a village. While many impor- tant rituals and dances have been taken over by associations, others have persist- ed in conjunction with them. An example of the latter is monenkim, girls' initiation, which is linked to the Leopard society. Girl's Initiation and the Leopard Society The Ekwe Ejagham (Western Ejagham) honor a first-born daughter by secluding her as soon as she has given birth to her first child.3 The parents reserve a room for her in their compound, which only cer- tain persons may enter, and provide her with as much food as she desires. Called monenkim, the "circumcised child," since the seclusion begins with a clitoridectomy, she remains there for as long as her par- ents can afford it, usually about one year. The initiate practices special dances and receives instructions on preparing ritual food, on marital life, and on Ejagham art traditions. During this entire period the monenkim is not affiliated with her imme- diate family, which no longer has the right to protect her. She is under the rule of Ngbe, the men's Leopard society. Her father, who most likely belongs to Ngbe, informs its members of her confinement by inviting them to the community hall to drink palm wine. african arts ? spring 1998</page><page sequence="4">Left: 4.

A member of the Ngbogha-Ndem asso- ciation, photographed by Mansfeld (1927: fig. 132). The scarified concentric circles on her cheeks are marks of beauty. At the end of her seclusion, the family must once again invite the Ngbe members to eat and drink. This is the occasion of the monenkim's coming-out ceremony, when she performs at the center of the village to confirm her new status as the mother of a child, a woman ready for marriage (Fig. 2). Her costume includes a skirt of bells, a decorated fan and a flywhisk, and white ornaments on her face and body. At the turn of the century, the monenkim also used black juice to draw signs called nsi- biri on her cheeks and forehead. The event begins with a dance by the Nkanda, a junior grade of the society (Fig. 3). It consists of several male dancers who appear with the mask called okum ngbe. From time to time one can hear the roar- ing voice of Ngbe, the society's most hid- den secret. Then the monenkim performs a Ngbe dance dedicated to the large slit- drum of the village, using Ngbe mimes learned during her seclusion. She next entertains the relatives, villagers, and guests with the repertoire of songs and dances she rehearsed during that time. The girl imitates the Nkanda4 dancers, miming the content of her songs; the women in the audience answer as a choir. The spectators comment avidly on the monenkim's performance; if they appreci- ate it, they will give her many presents and urge her to continue for several soring 1998 ? african arts hours. At the turn of the century the mon- enkim would dance around with a large calabash, beautifully decorated with nsi- biri signs, to collect gifts for her parents. The fact that the men's most impor- tant association dances at the girl's com- ing-out ceremony, thereby completing her initiation, confirms the interdepen- dence of men's and women's institutions. The Leopard society is responsible for the monenkim during her confinement. She in turn learns some of the society's dances and mimes that are its secret visual lan- guage, and she imitates specific move- ments of its dancers. Late in life she may take part in Ngbe as an honorary mem- ber. Moreover, women are the society's mythical founders. As the story goes, they discovered the secret of Ngbe in the water as they were fishing one day, and took it home. The women realized it could be used as a powerful institution, but after one of them revealed the secret to her husband, the men appropriated it for their own use. The Ngbogha-Ndem Association Long before colonial times, the Keaka Ejagham developed the Ngbogha-Ndem association, which modified the seclu- sion for first-born daughters. According to myth, the first ngbogha-ndem fell from the sky into a large mboma tree. She wore strange dance attire and spoke to the awed spectators in a language they did not understand. Later she married and taught some of the women her secrets. The Ngbogha-Ndem association quickly spread to other parts of Ejagham country and to neighboring ethnic groups (Ruel 1969) (Fig. 4), partly replacing the mon- enkim initiation ritual for first-born daughters (younger daughters continued to receive a smaller monenkim). Unlike the monenkim, whose completion of the ritual is not tied to membership in a women's society, the ngbogha-ndem becomes part of the association for first-born daughters upon her emergence from seclusion. Today initiations are no longer prac- ticed, and only a few elderly members are alive. In contrast to a monenkim, who is initiated after the birth of her first child, a ngbogha-ndem began her initiation at puberty, staying in a room in her father's compound for three to five years. During this time, bathing was forbidden. Instead the girl prepared her skin with coconut milk, the oil of pumpkin seeds, and white clay. Like the monenkim, the ngbogha-ndem underwent periods of strict seclusion, when she could not leave the room at all, and had to uphold serious taboos. She learned the association's secrets, includ- ing their secret language. On her neck, back, arms, and legs, she also received the scarifications of beauty to which only members were entitled, as well as beauty marks, often incorrectly described as trib- al marks, below the temples. At the turn of the century these consisted of seven concentric circles (Fig. 5); today young people prefer two or three small strokes on the cheeks. During other, less stressful, periods of seclusion, the novice practiced dancing. If by chance she met a stranger she would fall death-like to the ground- a practice to which the term ngbogha-ndem literally refers-and only a member of the association would be able to revive her. As with the monenkim, the ngbogha- ndem's seclusion ended with a big cele- bration featuring abundant food and drink. Everyone would be anxious to see the extraordinary beauty the novice had 41</page><page sequence="5">Above left: 6. Life-size commemorative figure in its house.

Like a mone- nkim, she married after the celebration, her husband paying twice the usual bride price. Most initiates were allowed to have a fiancee during their seclusion so that by the time they emerged, they had given birth to one or two children.5 A ngbogha- african arts ? spring 1998 42</page><page sequence="6">ndem enjoyed high status and was regard- ed with reverence throughout her life. She carried her stool with her to communal meetings, and was allowed to sit, like chiefs and elders, whereas all others had to stand. She was also among the first to be served refreshments. Whereas a monenkim is under the rule of the Leopard society during seclusion, the ngbogha-ndem remained under the rule of the women's association. The only men who performed in the association were the drummers, honorary members. Although the mythical founder was a woman, the Ejagham say the historical founder was a man. He was among those remembered during the offerings given by the eldest woman to the association's ancestors. Clay or Cement Statues The Ejagham explain that one of the major advantages of belonging to an association is that its members will dance at one's funeral. The higher the deceased's status, the more important the associations that perform. Membership in Ngbogha-Ndem requires not only a funeral performance but also a statue placed on one's grave spring 1998 ? alrican arts or, more commonly, in front of one's house (Figs. 1, 6-8; p. 2). When a ngbogha-ndem dies, her corpse must be carried from her husband's to her parents' house, since among the Ejagham the patrilineage is responsible for the funeral celebration. The body is placed in a sitting position and dressed in the woman's dance costume, includ- ing a staff with a flywhisk and an ape's thigh bone. Notified by the patrilineage, the association members gather to dance the entire night; during this time they are served by the deceased's family. In the early morning the men bury the de- ceased behind the house. The big funeral celebration usually takes place several months or years later. One week before the celebration is to begin, the members of the Ngbogha- Ndem association are called together again. Following their instructions, the patrilineage of the deceased now ar- ranges for the fabrication of the statue, a memorial made only for a ngbogha-ndem.6 The association members oversee its con- struction, consuming large quantities of beer all the while.

Women, among them specialized potters, would model the life-size figure in clay on a scaffold made of sticks brought by young men. Today, however, a bricklayer models the image in cement, a far more durable but also more costly option. Finally, association members paint the statue and decorate it with elements of the deceased's dance attire. The statue depicts a woman seated like a chief or elder and representing an honorable status in society. She sits upright, but with her legs supporting her elbows so that the arms are slightly elon- gated. The body is brightly colored in white or yellow and has broad stripes of red or blue, the same as those painted as a sign of beauty on the bodies of women in several of the dances.

The figure wears a head tie symmetrically ornamented with cowrie shells, crowned by a multitude of blue, black, and white feathers and one bigger white feather. A fashionable "mod- em" shawl covers her breasts, and a skirt adorned with cowries and a piece of leather draped with numerous bells are tied around the waist. She wears neck- laces of beads and raffia tassels, including a special necklace made with the skulls of two small bush animals. Actual rattles and arm adornments may be tied around the upper arms and ankles, or, alterna- tively, their representations may be mod- eled in clay. Small boxes containing shiny white stones are sometimes placed at the wrists. At the turn of the century these statues were also decorated with many snail shells and small decorated calabash- es. The right hand holds a special staff surmounted by a flywhisk of cow hair, a sign of status. The left hand holds the thigh bone of an ape, sometimes painted with stripes. These are all elements of the deceased's dance costume. Her per- sonal belongings, such as porcelain cups, plates, and work materials, as well as loincloths and precious items, are placed on the ground around the figure or hung from the roof. In carefully constructed houses, the walls are decorated with the same designs used in body painting. The Ejagham claim the statue is a "por- trait" of the deceased. Yet it certainly does not depict the subject as an old woman, even though old age is greatly respected. Instead the statue represents the Ejagham ideal of beauty, which a women manifests most clearly at the end of her seclusion at initiation. Some examples may suggest specific facial and body characteristics, but generally the statues are idealized fig- ures, without individualized facial fea- tures. A statue's singularity is instead expressed through the deceased woman's personal belongings placed around it- like the personal possessions of deceased chiefs and respected elders which are dis- played in commemorative spaces or on trees. Special hairstyles, facial paintings, or ornaments are not signs of specificity. As for the facial beauty marks, I saw con- centric circles on the temples of nearly all elderly people; the ones on the ngbogha- ndem were made with particular care. Nevertheless all the memorial figures now bear the small marks on the cheek that young people prefer today, not the circles on figures photographed by Mansfeld at Top: 10.

On the day of the big funeral celebra- tion, the fence protecting the statue during construction is removed. The guests view the statue and make comments about its beauty, as they did of the novice at her coming-out ceremony, and about its simi- larity to the deceased. The ngbogha-ndem dance around the figure and sing praise songs in honor of the deceased. They are served by her family. The festivities con- clude with an offering to the association's ancestors, performed by the most senior member. The statue is then left to decay. If it is made in clay, it soon perishes; if it is in cement, it may remain for years. After the head or the arms are broken off, the remains often serve as places for drying laundry or preparing food (Fig. 8). The Njom-Ekpa Association The women's Njom-Ekpa association, like the monenkim, is mythically connect- ed with the men's Leopard society. The Ejagham continue the origin myth of Ngbe: after the men had taken Ngbe away from the women, they feared their anger and gave them Njom-Ekpa instead. From then on, the women had their own association and their own secret, the secret of nkem, the python. Like Ngbe, Njom-Ekpa spread from the Calabar area to the Ejagham in Came- roon several decades ago. It is presently found in every village of the Ekwe Ejag- ham and is gradually spreading eastward to villages of the Keaka Ejagham. Bring- ing the association to a village is a costly enterprise. It entails acquiring the secrets, the grades, the offices, and the rights to perform the dances and songs. A carved headdress must be commissioned and the association members of the other village invited to eat and drink as long as is needed to teach the secrets, rules, dances, and songs. The women of the principal families of a village decide that they want the association. Each participating patri- lineage buys one of the offices, which is transferred from one generation to the next. In Njom-Ekpa there are at least eight offices, among them the owner of the headdress. Because the owner assumes most of the cost of commissioning the sculpture, she has the prerogative over that office. The majority of women in a village join; they do so right after marriage. If a woman's family has bought the rights to an office, she can hold this office after some time. If she marries into another vil- lage-among the Ejagham marriage is spring 1998 ? afrlcan arts usually virilocal-she may enter the asso- ciation and hold her office there. In most villages the association has two grades, but there may be only one or as many as three. Members are positioned, as is Ejagham society on the whole, on three levels according to age, status, and behav- ior. The newly initiated, who know some of the rules and almost none of the associ- ation's secrets, are the "children," or mes- sengers. The next level is the "adults," who comprise the dancers and singers; they are more knowledgeable about the secrets and adhere strongly to the associa- tion's rules. Finally, there are the "elders," or wise women (Fig. 10), who enforce the rules and who "sit on the mud bed," that is, take the seats of honor at assemblies; the most senior woman makes the offer- ings to the ancestors. At a dance they may allow the "adults" to perform in their names the roles associated with their offices. For example, the carved headdress is usually danced at festivals not by the owner but by one (or two) of the younger members known for their dancing ability. Like the Ngbogha-Ndem, the Njom- Ekpa association dances at the initiations of new members, the funerals of deceased members, and the communal festivals to which they are invited. When all guests are assembled in the village center, the women of the association parade through the entire village. The choir positions itself next to and behind the drummers, who, as in Ngbogha-Ndem, are the only male members and play a minor role in the association. Then the dance group, com- posed of at least nine women, appears. Some of them imitate and satirize typical male roles to the delight of the spectators: two or four "guards" run around carrying swords and machetes to control the dance floor; the "protocol leader" shakes his rat- tle; the "hunter's dog" searches for prey; the "soldier" points his gun at the audi- ence; the "policemen" (called "blue bot- toms") frighten with their large rods; the "fool" dances incorrect steps and behaves very impolitely; the "soothsayer," carry- ing an animal hide in his hand, throws two pairs of divining chains which he awakens by knocking at them with a stick, as real soothsayers do with a bushpig tooth (Fig. 11). Then there is the dancer of the headdress, accompanied by two or four young girls, each holding a mirror (Fig. 9). By directing their mirrors at the dancer, they guide her movements. When they step forward, she must follow suit; when they step backward, she is drawn after them. This group remains in the cen- ter of the dance floor while the other per- formers communicate with the public. The sculpted headdress consists of a large box painted with stripes; small mir- rors are inserted into the wood on each side. Pieces of cloth tied to the box allow the dancer to balance it easily on her head. The box contains one large figure and several smaller ones, which vary from village to village according to the imagination of the individual carver. On some of them, the central figure wears her hair in long curled or spiraled braids (Fig. 12)-a well-known style depicted on older skin-covered female heads; on oth- ers, she has long, smooth black hair or four short, thick braids on top of her head. She holds one arm up with a python in her hand. A second python is seen curling around her body, sometimes in the com- 45</page><page sequence="9">13. Dancers of the women's Egbobha associa- tion.

Usually the figure wears real ear- rings, and her cheeks are decorated with small beauty marks. The six or seven smaller figures placed around her have female bodies but wear modem men's clothes and hold machetes, sticks, or swords painted with stripes. Each of them is represented by one of the dancers. The model for the central sculpture is a foreign print that is said to have inspired the depiction of the water spirit Mamy Wata (Salmons 1977, Drewal 1988). The Ejagham, especially the association mem- bers, however, say it represents their female ancestor who inaugurated the association in the village. They insist that it is not Mamy Wata, because she lives in the sea and not in their part of the coun- try. Nevertheless, for Ejagham women an image of Mamy Wata is an appropriate representation of their ancestor: it incor- porates the features of a beautiful and respected woman, and it comes from a foreign world symbolizing the mysteri- ous powers brought by the ancestor and controlled through the association. 46 Of the wooden sculptures owned by Ejagham women's societies, those of Njom-Ekpa certainly are the most elabo- rate. I have seen two other types of sculptures used by women's associations in dances. The carved box of one of the headdresses contains a central female bust surrounded by four smaller human figures, and the entire headdress is brightly colored in oil paint, as all the new ones are, rather than covered with skin. It was used by a dance association, Egbobha, that existed in only one village (Cover; Fig. 13). The dancer was accom- panied by four young girls carrying mir- rors and decorated calabashes. Another association owns a headpiece with four faces-two brown male faces and two yellow female faces. The latter two, like the modem Ngbogha-Ndem funerary statues, have small beauty marks on the cheeks. Feather plumes decorate the top of the headdress, and pieces of white cloth surround the base. This sculpture corresponds more di- rectly to the skin-covered headpieces car- ried by women on certain occasions early in this century (Partridge 1905). These carved heads once resembled those of their male counterparts. Today the tech- nique and the coloring have changed. Often, as with Njom-Ekpa, the women own entire boxes with carved figures, while the men are content with simpler headpieces. Women dance with their faces unveiled, but the men cover theirs. Skin-covered Headpieces The male and female skin-covered masks of the Ejagham, worn in dance by mem- bers of men's associations, further exem- plify the complexity of meaning inherent in African images (Fig. 15).7 Although no longer produced, some still exist and must be worn on the rare occasion of a funeral celebration for an honorable elder who had been an association mem- ber. The masks of the young men's as- sociations are now covered not with skin but with colorful industrial paint. The criteria for membership have also changed. Membership previously corre- sponded to personal success in hunting, headhunting, or other accomplishments for the benefit of the community; today, anyone may enter. As in the older associations, male and female skin-covered masks almost always perform together.8 Sometimes, instead of a male-female pair of masks, a single dancer wears a janus-faced exam- ple that combines both elements (Fig. 16). The female face can easily be recognized by its yellow or white coloring; the male, which always faces front, is usually african arts ? sPring 1998</page><page sequence="10">14.

Female images display beauty marks (though not the older configuration of concentric circles), body ornaments, and occasional-^ ly, as on the older skin-covered examples, nsibiri signs-especially the one signify-_ ing love and reverence with which the monenkim preferred to decorate their faces at their coming-out ceremonies.'0 Nsibiri signs are only occasionally seen on male masks. Both types, however, usually reveal filed front teeth as a sign of beauty. The hairstyles of the female skin- covered masks include elaborate braids as well as some of the designs Ejagham , youths used to shave into their closely ' - . B cropped hair. The male faces often wear a 4- ' beard, though Ejagham men themselves do not. The new headpieces, especially the male ones, have modem hairstyles with combed hair and a part. Some of the masked dancers, like the Njom-Ekpa association's main dancer, are accompa- nied by a young girl. P. A. Talbot photo- graphed a number of these girls wearing nsibiri signs on their faces (1912). It is difficult to retrace the exact mean- ing of the skin-covered masks; headhunt- ing has not been practiced since the turn of the century, and the Ejagham are not fond of talking about this custom. The chief allowed only successful warriors or their direct followers to commission a skin-covered headpiece, which would then remain in the lineage of the owner. One of his sons would become a member of the association concered and wear the mask at his father's funeral celebra- tion to honor him. In this context, it rep- resented the deceased. After the son's death, the headpiece would in turn be danced at his funeral and represent both him and the original commissioner, and so on, as Mansfeld observed in 1908. Like the Ngbogha-Ndem figures and the Njom-Ekpa headdresses, the men's masks are not portraits of individuals. Whereas the female faces usually have idealized features, however, some of the male faces are distorted. In fact, a num- ber of the latter depict enemies and bear foreign facial markings. This under- standing of the masks-as portraying foreign or idealized figures and repre- senting ancestors-also explains why skulls (of enemies or large animals) could be worn like wooden heads and why they too were said to "be" the ancestors. Talbot (1912) mentioned, for example, that a masked dancer wearing a skull was received by the audience with "roaring laughter," a response that certainly would not be appropriate for spring 1998 ? african arts</page><page sequence="11">the appearance of an ancestor. The Ejagham explain that the ancestors owned the mask and were associated with it, but it was never the skull of an ancestor. In the course of the festivity, both could be invoked-the ridiculed enemy and the honored warrior. The female headpieces represent re- spected women. Women assisted the men in wartime; without their help the men could not win a battle. Robert Farris Thompson mentions the example of a shoulder mask with a male and a female face, said to represent a warrior and his wife, who contributed to her husband's success. The mask and its dance group performed a warrior's dance at which warlike behavior was mimed and ac- companied by praise songs about the couple (1974:175). In another village, a single head was said to "be" the wife of a respected man who wanted to honor her with a mask (Fig. 15; Nicklin 1974:68). In the Etan Mbembe association a female mask might even perform in an aggres- sive male dance (Fig. 14). As we already have seen with the Njom-Ekpa headdress, masks not only portray women but also are dedicated to them. The female headpieces depict ide- alized beauty-likely to be foreign, like 48 Mamy Wata-which is suitable for hon- oring respected women. In a similar way, the male masks represent the heads of enemies or animals (yet not all of the lat- ter are conceived as male) and signal the power of the owner to control them or their spirits. The Complementarity of Men's and Women's Associations All of the performances or art forms I have described honor respected persons, most obviously in the context of funerals. Men's masquerades have yet another important function. Aside from public festivals, where everyone may see them, they come out in certain instances when social order must be restored-when a serious crime has been committed or an association's law has been violated. Then, with the elders' permission, and after a messenger has announced the event, one or several masks appear. These dancers run through the streets threatening villagers with their weapons. During this time all unini- tiated people must stay inside their hous- es behind closed doors and windows. The elders of the village are responsible for maintaining the social order and the laws given by the ancestors. As senior Left: 15. Skin-covered headdress representing the late Ma Nto-Ayi. It is said to have been carved at least 70 years ago by the deceased's hus- band, Ekumkpe Ataikum, "to express his grati- tude." The mask, now owned by his brother, is worn with a red silk costume and performed at funerals and an annual village ceremony. Qua Ejagham, Nigeria, July 1971. Photo: Keith Nicklin. Right: 16.

Sculpt- ed heads are not carried on this occasion.1 The Ekpa-Atu women's association is summoned if the laws imposed by male elders conflict with the women's prin- cipal laws, an epidemic threatens the community, or anyone insults a woman's femininity. This is the case, for example, when insurmountable political problems arise, or when a woman carelessly drops her loincloth or the men's goats destroy african arts - spring 1998</page><page sequence="12">17.

To restore social order the women meet at night in the village's main streets, danc- ing naked and singing songs about their mystical powers. Then it is all the men who must remain inside their houses, behind locked doors and windows. In more serious cases, the women wash their bodies, the water they use becom- ing a powerful charm that makes men impotent or kills those who have offend- ed the women's principal laws. Ekpa-Atu complements Ngbe and Angbu. Instead of using masks, women of this association use their nakedness, which can affect men's potency in the same way that men's masquerades can affect women's fertility (Roschenthaler 1996). Performances by both the mas- queraders and the naked dancers stress the dancer's anonymity and "uniformi- ty" (Kramer 1993/1987), whereas perfor- mances at funerals publicly celebrate the lives and achievements of individual, respected persons, both women and men. spring 1998 ? african arts In this latter context, men's and women's masquerades are similar. Indeed, they are referred to by the same name, eci okum, or masquerade (literally "head of the association"). The difference is that the faces of the women who carry the sculptures are unveiled. One reason why male masqueraders cover their faces is that they use the same disguise for both kinds of performances: the threatening one, where their personal identities cannot be revealed, and the public one, where anonymity is not that important. Women have two different "disguises": the threatening naked dance in the night, in which their anonymity does not depend on the wearing of masks, and the masquerade with the carved headdress at public ceremonies. The interdependence of Ejagham men's and women's institutions is constructed through myths which are lived in their rit- uals and enacted in their associations. Both men and women own influential institutions for important social purposes, and in most of them a gender-crossing honorary membership is possible. These institutions are complementary not only in their ability to maintain social order but also in their public funeral performances. The second funeral celebration requires that statues be modeled for members of Ngbogha-Ndem and that masks be per- formed for members of mask-owning associations. On this occasion both men and women are honored in praise songs sung by the women's choir. In most men's public masquerades, male and female aspects are combined; it is particularly noteworthy that a female image could be worn to perform an aggressive warrior's dance. The meaning of the masks there- fore depends largely on the choreography of the performance and on the songs. Instead of emphasizing men's pre- dominance in masking and the apparent absence of this activity among women, we should focus on the intentions of those who perform in men's and women's insti- tutions. The Ejagham seem to regard the sculpted headdresses owned by women's associations as belonging in the same cat- egory as men's masks. This interpretation is underscored by the fact that they are given the same name. Thus, the Ejagham concept of masquerades, including not only dancers with veiled faces but also those without, suggests that we must con- sider alternative modes of African mask- ing classifications.

This is less so for the Gambian masks discussed by Weil, in which both male and female types incorporated the element of concealed power. 2. For Mumbo Jumbo in its Caribbean context see Nunley &amp; Bettelheim 1988. 3. Thompson's seminal African Art in Motion (1974) cut across these categories by considering several case studies at once. 4. For example, the historically senior Akweya akpnmobe mask of central Idomaland, which is found only in the Ekpari clan of two villages. 5. This is not to say that all Diaspora masquerades fit this model: there are well-known examples such as Candomble in Bahia which do not. 6. Women in a large group move from one settlement to anoth- er singing, dancing, and demanding gifts and blessings. Men who do not cooperate are ostracized and publicly insulted. 7. In one case documented by Paul Spencer, the women pun- ished an elder who had raped a young girl by seizing him, stomping on his genitals, and then slaughtering and cooking his favorite ox (Spencer 1988:206). 8. The connection is very explicit in Samburu culture (where elephants are still a part of everyday life). See Fratkin 1974. 9. Judith Bettelheim has told me that the cloth canopy is also found in West Africa (personal communication, March 10, 1998). 10. This is analogous to assuming that ritual is about the sacred. Both are conditions which would hold true for some, but certainly not all, instances in Africa. 11. I use spectacle to mean the public display of a society's central meaningful elements by which it periodically re- invents itself. Carnival is one example, the Olympic games another (MacAloon 1984, DaMatta 1990, Beeman 1993). 12. Numerous sources have documented insurrections against slave-holders and other forms of subversion which were orga- nized at drum dances, religious meetings, and festival perfor- mances, and, in North America, at ring-shouts. 13.

ROSCHENTHALER: Notes, from page 49 This article is based on field research carried out in 1987 and 1988 among the Ejagham of southwestern Cameroon. It was supported by the Nachwuchsforderung des Landes Berlin and the German Academic Exchange Service. I extend my thanks to all the Ejagham women and men who assisted me in the field and responded with patience to my questions. Shirley Ardener, Brunhilde Biebuyck, Sally Chilver, Sidney Littlefield Kasfir, Heidrun Mader, Zoe Strother, and Tobias Wendl have read earlier drafts of this article, and I am grateful for their comments. Any remain- ing infelicities are my own. 1. Among the Lega of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the wives of members of the Bwami society dance with masks (Biebuyck 1985). Among the Bokyi of the Cross River area, Keith Nicklin describes a mask of the Egbeghe women's association which is danced by a woman whose body and face are completely veiled in cloth (1974:15). Sometimes, too, women may create a masked dance in response to a topical event, but it does not develop into a permanent institution (Staschewski 1917, Weston 1984). 2. For example, there is Nsibiri, which was gradually re- placed by Ngbe at the turn of the century, and associations in which successful hunters could be initiated (Okwa, Ncebe, Nkpe, and Ndum-Ngang, to mention just a few). 3. This is contrary to the usual West African practice, in which girls are secluded and circumcised before pregnancy. In areas bordering towns, especially in the Nigerian part of the Ejagham country, today some girls are circumcised right after birth. This does not, however, apply to first-born daughters, who are sup- posed to undergo the monenkim seclusion. 4. The term refers not only to this grade of the Leopard soci- ety (Nkanda) but also its members and its performance (nkanda). 5. According to Ejagham custom a ngbogha-ndem was circum- cised after the birth of her first child, not at the beginning of her initiation. 6. Other women and men, including the drummers, honorary members of the association, did not have anthropomorphic statues erected after their deaths. In recent decades rich fam- ilies have started to place crosses and other sculptures made of cement on the graves of deceased family members. 7. I do not describe them extensively here, since they are quite well known. According to Nicklin (1974:8), Ejagham carvers (and those of other ethnic groups at the Cross River) are the only ones in the world who have specialized in the compli- cated process of covering masks with skin. For a summary of that process see Campbell 1983. In the '70s Nicklin met sev- eral carvers who were still able to cover headpieces with antelope skin. 8. Among those authors who have described the dance chore- ography are Jones 1945; Blier 1980:8-9; Nicklin in Vogel 1981:170. 9. This is the only point on which all the literature on skin- covered masks does indeed agree. 10. For a summary of the literature on the nsibiri and the skin- covered masks in international museums and private collec- tions, see Campbell 1981, 1983. 11. The dancers of Angbu carry them at public festivals, but the Ngbe association does not own any sculpted heads. It has often been said that the skin-covered heads were owned by Ngbe, but this is the case only with the older association sometimes called Nsibiri, which was replaced by Ngbe. Angbu and Ngbe dancers never appear together. Angbu is responsible for minor infractions and Ngbe for the major ones. References cited Acholonu, Catherine O. 1985.

While in Kabompo District I conducted research only among women; therefore in my comparison of the structure of mwadi and mukanda, I will be using a woman's viewpoint of mukanda. Any information I have of events within the mukanda camp comes from the published literature, predom- inantly by male scholars; from Manuel Jordan, a fellow art historian who has studied mukanda in Kabompo District but from a man's point of view; or from female informants. I do not have photographs taken inside the camp. 2. The interval between the girl's first menstruation and the beginning of the initiation can be as long as several months. During this time the girl remains in the kitchen, being allowed to leave only for school and other limited and super- vised excursions. To protect her during this dangerous limi- nal time, her grandmother administers protective medicines and gives her a medicine packet to wear under her arm. 3. These divisions follow van Gennep's model (1960) for all rites of passage. 4. Although in the past the circumcisor was a local skilled man, today the role is often taken by a male nurse or medical technician from a local hospital. Some missionaries and expa- triate doctors also perform this role in efforts to control infec- tions and reduce mukanda-related deaths. 5. Personal communication, Manuel Jordan, 1992. 6. Among the men the mask itself is called "the head of the likishi" (mutwe) and the costume is "the body of the likishi" (mujimba; Jordan 1993:43). Women do not make this differen- tiation because they are not allowed to see the men's mask and costume without the dancer inside. 7. For discussion of this idea, see Cole 1985 and Drewal 1985, 1992. 8. In Zambian English, "cheat" means to tease or trick. It often has a good-natured connotation, but this is not always the case. 9. Manuel Jordan was not able to confirm that this medicine was indeed used in constructing makishi. 10. The woman who gave me this information was drunk during all my interviews with her, and I suspected that she expected payment for talking to me. All the women listening, however, both drunk and sober, agreed with her. 11. Manuel Jordan reports that men also use these same cate- gories for nIakishi (personal communication, 1995). 12. It is tempting indeed to interpret the chase:dance di- chotomy according to the following structuralist formula: chase:dance::bush:village. The makishi that chase are outfitted in skins and bark, items from the bush. They are fierce, wreak- ing havoc on the community. The makishi that dance, on the other hand, wear manufactured cloth borrowed from the women and carry musical instruments, all items of culture. Women, however, identify both types as being from the bush and dangerous, while also all living together in a village (cul- ture) inside of mukanda. Women keep a respectful distance from both types of makishi. Furthermore, both, whether chas- ing or dancing, entertain the women and "make them happy." 13. Older Western definitions of masquerades center on the root word "mask," defined in Webster's Nezw World Dictionary as "a covering for the face or part of the face, to conceal or dis- guise the identity." Mask then becomes synonymous with face mask. The anthropologist Clark Wissler calls them "false-faces" (1950:1). He explains the purpose of masking to be the "impersonation" of some other entity, usually a deity. The mask signals the identity of the intended deity to the audience. Wissler maintains that face paint can perform the same function of identifying the "god or demon" that the wearer impersonates (1950:31). 14. Herbert Cole has more recently reconsidered the necessi- ty of concealing the face of the masquerader (personal com- munication, 1995). 15. Pernet does express misgivings about the term "society without writing," but states that he uses it as a "shorthand" for "societies which the authors whose theories I am testing grouped under the rubric of 'primitive societies' and 'soci- eties without writing"' (1992:6). 16. It is significant, as Sidney Kasfir reminded me, that nei- ther Tonkin or Pernet have done fieldwork, and thus are cat- egorizing events already simplified by the scholar who originally reported on them. Masquerade theory constructed by scholars who have worked in the field, such as Cole and Kasfir, tends to take into account a "messy reality." spring 1998 ? atrican arts 17. The myth that women were originally in control appears in many areas of Africa and the world. 18. Another example of this phenomenon occurs among the Dogon where, during specific funerals, women perform sim- ilar parallel masquerades, transforming themselves with found materials and performing for male audiences (Calame- Griaule 1956:298-300). 19. Exceptions are when women help make the cord for likishi costumes or men collect wood for women's fire masks (dis- cussed later in this article). Neither the men nor the women are told the final use of the materials. 20. Sarah Brett-Smith (1994) reports that some Bamana women carve ritual objects of wood-but they must do it secretly. Sidney Kasfir noted that women use an adz to carve dolls and milk containers (personal communication, 1997). 21. The literature is not clear as to whether or not the face is actually covered. Similar masks of fire are used in ceremonies for witchcraft in Kabompo District (Manuel Jordan, personal communication, 1995). 22. In Luchazi: makisi vavamal, masks of men; makisis vavamp- wevo, masks of women. 23. Robert Papstein saw the impact one of these books can make in North-Western Province when he returned to Chavuma one year after he had helped edit The History of the Luvale People and their Chieftainship (Sangambo 1979): When I presented my credentials to the District Governor, he politely, but firmly, told me that not only would I not be allowed to do field work but that I was to be confined to the boma under the direct supervision of the CID and that I would be returned to Lusaka on the next weekly airflight. He explained that the district was, after months of negotiations, finally becoming calm again after the publication of a new Luvale History book which I had helped to edit. (Papstein 1989:372) 24. This performance illustrates that makishi appear outside of initiation contexts in many public forums, but always under the control of initiated men. 25. Mwadi, on the other hand, does not stress secrecy. Any woman, whether a mwadi graduate or not, can freely enter an initiation enclosure and participate in teaching the girl. Restrictions against men during mwadi exist, it is said, to pro- tect the male community from the charged and potentially dangerous presence of the female novice. 26. Mary H. Nooter discusses the use of secrecy to create boundaries in her well-argued chapter "The Impact of the Unseen" (1993).

Scheper-Hughes writes: "Real-life caravals can be as egali- tarian and emancipatory as Bakhtin, da Matta (1979,1981,1986), and Davis (1978) wish them to be, as oppressive and hierarchi- cal as the Marxist and clerical critics of carnaval play can only see them to be, or both simultaneously" (1992:482). 3. I. M. Belisario's booklet is available only at the National Library of Jamaica. The prints are signed and dated 1836, while the booklet was printed in 1837. It is unpaginated. 4. Scott wrote a historical novel, Tom Cringle's Log (1895), pub- lished first in serial form from 1829 to 1833. 5. "Mabiales" may very well refer to the Marbial region of Haiti; Belisario simply omitted the r. Documentation of the dominance of more recently arrived Kongo Africans is under- scored by much recent scholarship. In fact, in Belisario's sketch of the French Set-Girls, the musical instruments are all Kongo in origin. 6. Sidney Kasfir indicates that Olu is the precolonial term for "upcountry" (as opposed to riverine) Igbo, so the linguistic connection between eastern Cuba and Igbo country is again suggested (personal communication, April 17, 1997). 7. I have been compiling images and evidence from various locations in West Africa where women perform while holding up cloth, virtually parading beneath it. Such performances have been documented by Anita Glaze among the Senufo, Sylvia Boone among the Mende, and Susan Foss among the Urhobo. Sidney Kasfir also reminds us in her introduction of a performance documented in this issue by Ute Roschenthaler among Ejagham Njom-Ekpa, a women's association, where women perform under a canopy hung with scarves. I join the many scholars of the African Diaspora who warn against any facile statements concerning "retentions." Just sorting through all the possibilities is an education in itself.
