(John Trotwood Moore Papers , Tennessee State Library and Archives) JMM TROTWOOD MOORE AID TIE PâTtlJCIâi CULI Of TOE MEW SOUTH! by Fred Arthur Bailey 66Tn the South social standing is everything," I proclaimed Tennessee's man of letters John JL Trotwood Moore in 1906. Long grieved by what he considered the North's malignant influence upon the post-Civil War South, he determined to restore his version of its antebellum civilization, a virtuous culture wisely governed by an enlightened patriciate. Moore cast himself as an apologist teenth century chronicle as well as the writer of historical and À political essays, he marched JĚ in the van of those southern JH literati who employed a canted interpretation of the past to perpetuate antebellum aristocratic values well into the twentieth century. The scion of one of the region's more promi- nent families, he pro- moted an elite version of the South's heritage, a precious world populated by sagacious gentlemen, gracious ladies, and hum- ble slaves.1 Although by the dawning of the twentieth century Moore's South lacked much of the antebellum era's opulence and grace, its well-born ruling class had regained power, while other Southerners - white as well as black - once again stood in subordinate places.2 Born into Alabama's black belt establish- ment in 1858, Moore settled near Columbia, Tennessee, in 1885 where he assumed the mantle of a gentleman farmer devoted to fine horse flesh and literary pursuits. From the publication of his immensely popular anthology Songs and Stories of Tennessee in 1897 to his death in 1929, he dedicated his ebullient personality, his unfailing energy, for the Old South. The author of nostal- gic stories, novels, and poems set in ^ the context of the region's nine- and his evangelistic zeal to the cause of a ^ distinctive historiography defined and dictated by the South's upper- ^ classes. Southern children, he proclaimed in 1925, must not "read the pernicious and untruthful historians who would wantonly slander i I I J ļ the that all was this wealth erners Knowledgeable lazy, sive the dead false an the and idle, impulse "should and aristocracy statement by degenerate." Old unprogres- slavery, teaching of South- resent South right- with - of that the Old South was an aristocracy of ļ wealth and slavery, - J lazy, idle, unprogres- sive and degenerate." I Knowledgeable South- I erners "should resent this false statement with all the impulse of right- eous indignation." The plain truth, he averred, HF was "that up until the [Civil W/ War] the people of the South f were the most progressive on the continent."3 Moore's cultural values sprang from a pampered childhood characterized by social stratification and the intense post-bellum struggle of his class to resurrect its status follow- ing northern defeat. John 16</page><page sequence="2">John Trotwood Moore 17 Moore, his father, was a distinguished Marion, Alabama, attorney and jurist descended from an impressive lineage that included the first royal gov- ernor of South Carolina and a United States Supreme Court justice appointed by President John Adams. Well regarded and much honored, the elder Moore maintained a comfortable colonnaded man- sion cushioned by the labor of ten slaves. It was a pretty world rudely disrupted by civil war. A cap- tain of Alabama troops, John Moore was captured by Union soldiers in June 1864 and thereafter suf- fered the indignation of imprisonment at Johnson's Island, Ohio. Broken in health, he returned home to appreciative neighbors who in 1 865 elected him to the Alabama legislature and two years later elevated him to the position of judge of the state's Fourth Circuit. But when John Moore refused to seat African Americans on his juries in 1868, the Federal general in charge of occupying troops demanded and received his resignation. John Trotwood Moore admired his father's stand for principle, his proud proclamation that "Alabama had not ratified the 13th and 14th Amendments to the Constitution," and was therefore exempt from the oppression of Negro enfranchisement. The judge's defiant letter of resignation "hangs on the wall of my library," boasted John Trotwood Moore more than a half cen- tury later. "This is the only degree, the only diploma I would care to hand down to my son."4 Moore's family had been the beneficiaries of a social system in which a privileged few prospered from the labor of the dispossessed many. This small elite molded a culture that assumed social order was best served when every individual resided in his "proper place." Ensconced at the top of virtually every southern community, the "best families" were rarely challenged by less favored whites and almost never threatened by African slaves.5 Moore's presentation of an idealized southern chronicle stood in sharp relief to historical reality. Aristocrats had led the South out of the Union in 1861, confident that subsistence farmers and impoverished laborers would follow them in their bloody campaign. Initially they were correct, but in time the realities of deaths, wounds, and suffering families prompted the white under-class to re-exam- ine its role in a war fought so that aristocrats might own slaves and exploit those who did not; thou- sands among the lesser whites then abandoned the Confederate cause. This dealt southern elites a severe ideological blow. If proper social order man- dated the subordination of most men - white as well as black - to the aristocrats' leadership, then the common soldier's flight from faith struck at the very heart of traditional class relationships.6 Confederate defeat impeded the reassertion of aristocratic hegemony after the war, and in the cen- tury's last decades discontented black and white agrarians repeatedly denounced the elites' gover- nance just as northern historians harshly judged the antebellum planter class. Southern patricians responded vigorously, preaching the linked doc- trines of class stratification and white supremacy. Although they had re-established their personal for- tunes, and at Reconstruction's demise their political influence, the elites could no longer count upon the quiet acquiescence of small farmers and artisans. The Grange movement, the Farmer's Alliance, and the Populist Party crusade evidenced rejection of the southern oligarchy.7 At the same time northern patriotic organiza- tions and historians developed interpretations of the antebellum epoch which further diminished the sta- tus of southern patricians. Representing Union vet- erans, the Grand Army of the Republic viewed their Civil War experience as the climactic struggle in the establishment of an American democratic millennia. They saw themselves as heroic crusaders, citizen- soldiers engaged in a struggle against the corrupt forces of class distinction as epitomized by the South's slave-rich planters. Although their war had been designed to destroy the cancerous power of the slavocracy, these veterans developed little empathy for oppressed African Americans. To the veterans, freedom for the slave was an incidental result of the quest to defeat the villainous southern aristocrat.8 Northern historians, who shared this millennial cosmology and who were caught up in their own worship of Anglo-Saxon democracy and national progress, further questioned the "self-evident worth" of patrician rule. In thick tomes, historians James Ford Rhodes, James Schouler, and John Bach McMaster condemned the planter class, scorned its antique social and economic philosophies, exposed its inhumanity toward slaves and other whites, and placed upon it the onus of war guilt. "The pride of</page><page sequence="3">18 Tennessee Historical Quarterly the slaveholder" would accept no legislative limits on its expansion, declared Schouler. He wilted before "the rays of a disapproving civilization that beat down too hot for him." Planters were accused of misusing their antebellum suzerainty, of hoarding southern wealth, and of impoverishing other whites. "The ruling class of Virginia," criticized McMaster, "was not at all disposed to be taxed for the educa- tion of the children of poor whites." This system bred discontent, argued Rhodes, because "poor whites of the South looked on the prosperity of the slave-holding lord with rank envy and sullenness; his trappings contrasted painfully with their want of comforts."9 Northern attacks on the South were in reality critiques of a particular group of Southerners - the aristocrats themselves. Significantly, the crusade for an elite southern interpretation of American history commenced at the height of the Populist Party movement as poor whites - and blacks - rebelled against the long dominant upper-classes toward the century's end. From Virginia to Texas, this extraordinary biracial alliance of small farmers mounted a serious threat to the South's establishment. Patricians promptly met this challenge, defeating the Populists in the elec- tion of 1 896 by blatantly appealing to white fears of black domination. Again secure in their control of state legislatures, white elites quickly enacted laws to abort the incipient black-white coalition. Throughout the South, poll taxes, literacy tests, and all-white Democratic primaries virtually eliminated black suffrage and significantly reduced the rolls of white voters as well.10 The South's "best families" recognized, how- ever, that to avoid future conflicts the restriction of civil rights must be intellectually and emotionally acceptable - at least to southern whites. Thus the region's children had be taught to "think correctly," to appreciate the virtues of elite rule, to fear the enfranchisement of blacks, and to revere the Confederate cause. History properly presented would perpetuate Old South values in the ensuing generations." Tennessee elites fully appreciated the magni- tude of the class struggle in the post-Civil War South. Unlike the region as a whole, however, the state emerged from the Reconstruction epoch with a viable two party system in which Democrats and Republicans competed throughout the 1880s. Secure in their support from Unionist East Tennessee, Republicans threatened victories in statewide elections through their strong appeal to blacks and impoverished whites across Middle and West Tennessee. Desperate to counter this chal- lenge, Democrats resorted to fraud, demagoguery, and intimidation to neutralize black voting and to dilute Republican strength. The efforts succeeded. In 1886 and again in 1888 Democrats corrupted the electoral system to secure all but thirty-five of the one-hundred-thirty-two seats in the Tennessee General Assembly.12 Emboldened by their triumphs, the Democrats immediately passed legislation designed to constrict democracy, to eliminate black voting, and to con- fine white voting largely to the better class of peo- ple. A series of enactments severely reduced the number of ballot boxes (making needful stuffing easier), implemented a poll tax, and forbade assis- tance to illiterate voters. These measures had the desired effect. By 1900, black voting had been greatly reduced in Tennessee and the Republican Party had been largely isolated to its East Tennessee constituency. Grounded in the power of the old planter elite, Democrats rejoiced. "The Democratic Party represents nine-tenths of the intelligence and property of the state," editorialized the Memphis Daily Appeal. All measures "for its protection is therefore for the preservation of the best interest of the state.'"3 A life-long and fervent Democrat, John Trotwood Moore happily counted himself a member of Tennessee's intelligent and propertied class. In common with like-minded Southerners, his fear of subversion from the South's under-class and his dis- dain for misinformed northern reformers justified all measures - however extreme - necessary to create a properly articulated society. When in 1908 the edi- tor of a Brooklyn, New York, newspaper criticized racial segregation, Moore petulantly queried: "When did the South ever interfere in any of the social or labor problems of the East? . . . Yet the South cannot pass local laws to keep buck negroes from squatting on the skirts of her women in the car or theater but what some . . . God- Almighty rises up to read her lessons.'"4 Moore was a solid member of that social group for whom the term "Southerners"</page><page sequence="4">John Trotwood Moore : 19 In 1908, a Brooklyn editor advocated desegregation, STATING INTERMARRIAGE OF BLACK AND WHITE WOULD EVENTUALLY "bleach out" the black race. Moore believed that the "pure blood Negro " had much to be proud of and "should stimulate race pride among his own. " (The Taylor-Trotwood Magazine, July 1908) designated only members of their own class; all oth- ers - white as well as black - were the undergirding upon which their superior civilization was built. Moore's mind-set mirrored his privileged cir- cumstances. He relished memories of a halcyon era in which masters and slaves resided together with mutual affection and where chivalrous Confederate soldiers sallied forth to challenge the Yankee invaders. In a seminal event of his youth, Moore stood in awe as Nathan Bedford Forrest's command trooped through tiny Marion. To his delight, one soldier hoisted him upon a steed, enabling him to ride a short distance and giving him a thrill he would relish for the balance of his days.15 Other memories were less felicitous. Federal troops occupied Marion early in 1865, placed the town under marshall law, and turned the dormitories of a local college into a sanctuary for newly freed blacks. A less than dispassionate witness to these events, Moore held in contempt the "rule of the car- pet-bagger, the alien and the ignorant" all of whom were the wanton minions of "the capitalistic wealth of Wall Street."16 In spite of emancipation, the Moore family retained its affluence and social connections into the post-bellum era, a circumstance that opened for John Trotwood Moore opportunities for a superior education and personal advancement unavailable to those born into a less favored status. In 1874, he enrolled at Howard College, a respected Baptist school then located in his home community. He rel- ished lessons in literature, ancient history, and the Greek classics, he reveled in the competition of col- lege debating, and he revered his favorite teacher - Colonel James T. Murfee, an honor graduate of the Virginia Military Institute who had studied under the fabled Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson.17 For six years following his graduation in 1878, Moore taught at various schools as he grappled for a calling suited to his proclivities. He held several appointments, first in Monterey and then in Pineapple, Alabama, where, financed by local elites, he opened a private school bearing his name in 1884. The Moore Academy proudly offered the progeny of the community's best families quality courses in "Latin, French, German, Chemistry, Penmanship, Elocution and Vocal Music." Even as Moore struggled with the responsibilities of teach- ing and administration, he also read law, tutored by the politically astute Hilary A. Herbert, who later served President Grover Cleveland as Secretary of the Navy.18 Although respected as an academician and successful in his pursuit of the bar, neither the challenges of teaching nor the exactitudes of law greatly fascinated him.</page><page sequence="5">20 Tennessee Historical Quarterly Moore's marriage to Florence W. Allen in early 1885 and his subsequent move to Middle Tennessee to reside near his well-connected in-laws provided for him both a lifestyle suited to his heritage and a cultural environment inspirational to his budding literary interests. He easily ingratiated himself with the patriciate surrounding Columbia, Tennessee. An admiring biographer later reflected that Columbia residents embraced him as a masterful specimen of their own class for "being from the Black Belt of Alabama was like being from the Low Country of South Carolina, or the Tidewater in Virginia, or the Bluegrass in Kentucky." He com- fortably assumed the attributes of a gentleman farmer, indulged his passion for blooded stock, and developed a reputation as an author of merit. His life's course was set; he traveled an amiable path to success in a society that esteemed birth, status, and intellectual conformity even more than it did ability and achievement.19 Following Florence Moore's untimely demise in December 1896, John Trotwood Moore grieved until the following November when he met Mary Brown Daniel at a dinner party given by her sister, the wife of a Vanderbilt University professor. The daughter of a prominent Missouri attorney, Mary Daniel Brown had come to Tennessee to study at the Nashville College for Young Ladies and after grad- uation remain to teach music at her alma mater. They married in June 1900, and shortly thereafter purchased a small farmstead just south of Nashville, constructed on it a two-story Victorian mansion, and hosted weekend gatherings that attracted Tennessee's literary and political notables. "There usually was a crowd at the Moores on Saturday nights and Sunday afternoons," reminisced a former Vanderbilt student enchanted by the family. "We went on possum hunts, and talked books and poems. John Trotwood would read some of his [poems], or perhaps an excerpt from a story or novel on which he was at work. This tall, kindly man was in demand throughout the South as a friend and speaker."20 Smitten by the literary muse, Moore honed his skills as a local colorist. His works were morality plays almost always set in the context of his adopted Tennessee, though on occasion memories from his native Alabama flowed from his fecund pen. As a novelist, poet, historian, and social essayist, his col- lected works demonstrate a deep love for an ideal- ized Old South, a disdain for the perceived evils of the New South, and a dedication to right the wrongs of his contemporary world. Moore blended the style of a novelist with the musings of a historian and the rage of a reformer to produce what he coined "historionized fiction." He earnestly believed that if the public of his own era looked with discernment through the mirror of the past, it would repent of modern evils and restore the virtues of the antebellum epoch. History must be made appealing. "If we can make our fiction live," he asked, "why, then, should we not make our real characters live? The historian who solves that will write great history."21 Moore created a grand historical paradigm melding the virtues of aristocratic rule, the natural submission of the black race, and the perversion of Yankee society. Tinting the racist theories of Social Darwinism with southern upper-class hauteur, he developed a limited image of the Old South that defined white aristocrats as the prime movers creat- ing the region's admirable civilization. More than a simple continuation of the traditions of the proslave polemics, this glorification of a patrician South jus- tified anti-black violence, Jim Crow legislation, and the demonization of the North as necessary devices to restore and assure elite rule. Moore preached that the southern patriciate held firm to the values of Anglo-Saxon purity and the Protestant faith, mak- ing it genetically and morally superior to a degener- ate Yankee race mongrelizing with Catholics, Jews, southern and eastern Europeans, and even Negroes. "The South's greatest glory is this," he confided to Tennessee's Superintendent of Public Instruction in 1922. "We have twenty million pure blooded Anglo-Saxon white people. No other country except England herself, can show a greater percent. . . . these people will be the power which will save this Republic from anarchy and disunion."22 Although Moore - a product of the South's favored class - arrived at his racial theories through observations he considered self-evident, his values reflected in large measure the worship of Anglo- Saxon supremacy current among American intellec- tuals North and South. Moore's discovery of Joseph P. Widney's Race Life of the Aryan Peoples in 1909</page><page sequence="6">John Trotwood Moore 21 heightened his admiration of the Anglo-Saxon, the Aryan, and the Nordic hues and confirmed his assumption of their rightful ascendency over lesser men. Moore claimed that his "friend . . . Theodore Roosevelt" personally recommended it to him as "one of the most remarkable books of the century." The Tennessee author joyously reviewed The Race Life of the Aryan Peoples proclaiming it "the great- est book of its kind, if not the only great book of its kind, ever written." Widney provided proof, not theory, that the "white man has gone onward and upward in the scale of evolution" even as the Negroid peoples retained "some fatal defect in [their] mental make up." Moore averred that "no white man's education" would be complete without exposure to Widney's insight.23 Moore's proclamation of the gospels of white supremacy and aristocratic virtue began in 1897 with the publication of his Stories and Songs of Tennessee, a work that assured him an honored place among southern literary figures. His more important books included The Bishop of Cottontown (1906), a novel condemning child labor in southern textile mills, Uncle Wash (1910), a collection of "humorous" stories related in dialect by an "old timed Negro," and Hearts of Hickory (1926), a his- torical romance reflecting Moore's adoration of Andrew Jackson. Dismayed by the lack of literary outlets for southern authors, in 1905 he founded Trotwood's Monthly as a venue for his own writings and as a forum for the promotion of southern cul- ture. Two years later, it combined with a similar effort published by former Tennessee Governor Robert L. Taylor to become the Taylor-Trotwood Magazine. Although it rarely, if ever, prospered, Moore cherished his magazine, nurtured it through five difficult years, and lamented its demise. "The Taylor-Trotwood failed for one reason only," he fumed almost two decades later. "We hired a little Boston two-by-four Ph.D. graduate as a business manager. ... He had no vision nor executive abil- ity and that was fatal to us."24 This advertisement for Moore 's most popular novel, The Bishop of Cottontown, appeared in a 1907 issue of The Taylor-Trotwood Magazine. (The Taylor-Trotwood Magazine, April 1907)</page><page sequence="7">22 Tennessee Historical Quarterly When in 1919 the Tennessee General Assembly combined the office of State Library and with the office of the Department of History and Archives, Governor A. H. Roberts appointed Moore the director of the newly created bureaucracy. Given his social standing, his powerful political connections, and his boundless love of southern cul- ture in general and Tennessee heritage in particular, he was the ideal person to revitalize the state's mori- bund record-keeping system. "Mr. Moore is an ornament to the race," proclaimed Nashville financier James E. Caldwell to the governor. He "will reflect great credit on those who appointed him, and the office which he will fill." Throughout his decade-long tenure, Moore energized the library and archives, making it into one of the South 's bet- ter repositories of historical materials. Given the potential importance of this position, he frequently lectured on southern topics and in 1923 edited the multi-volume Tennessee: The Volunteer State, authoring both its introduction and the chapter enti- tled "The Race Life of Tennessee." During this same period, he published articles featuring notable Tennessee figures, the most important of which were essays in the Saturday Evening Post on Andrew Jackson, Sam Houston, and Andrew Johnson. Considering himself a "student of history and biology," Moore constructed a powerful histor- ical dogma, the story of a lost and cherished civi- lization that had scarcely existed in reality, but had nonetheless formed in the corporate memory of the South's vanquished upper-classes.25 Anglo-Saxon purity and incorruptible aristo- cratic will underscored Moore's historical themes, ideas eagerly endorsed by those who admired him as a model of old South virtue. When in May 1925, Montgomery, Alabama, civic leaders unveiled at St. John's Episcopal Church a "handsome bronze tablet" memorializing Confederate President Jefferson Davis's association with the congregation, Moore was their natural choice to deliver appropri- ate words. Caught up in the hyperbole of rhetoric, he expounded that from "the pure blooded Anglò Saxon has come Washington, the two Jacksons, Robert E. Lee, and the greatest Generals of America" and chief among these "came Jefferson Davis, the flower of its chivalry, the cold steel of its courage, the smile of its gentleness, the rapier of its romance, and the buckler and breast-plate of its honor." If Davis was the honor of the South, then the South's honor was embodied in its ethnic fidelity. "We are the children not of our father and mother but of our race. It is well to teach our chil- dren that they are well bred, descendents of heroes. Only the pure breed ever reaches the stars." The assemblage - composed of Governor William W. Brandon, hoary Confederate veterans, and invited city elites - roared its approval. "Mr. Moore's trib- ute to President Davis and the old south was one of the most scholarly addresses every heard in Montgomery," editorialized the local newspaper. "Its eloquence, careful diction and high thoughts inspired the entire audience [which] listened with deep and appreciative interest."26 Moore's Old South traced its lineage from what he considered the superior Anglo-Saxon stock that first landed on the Virginia and Carolina shores and then slashed its way into the Tennessee wilderness. "The history of Tennessee proper begins with the first permanent abode of white people within the present limits of this state," he wrote in 1923. These folk appreciated that the "pedigree of a people . . . fixes their principles" and determined to keep "their race-life" undiluted. Englishmen, he moralized, stood in glorious contrast to degenerate Frenchmen who "by intermarrying with the Indians and treating them as equals made the savages their friends." Anglos held firm, even to the point of wars caused by the Indian's discontent because "the English pio- neer never considered him his equal." Nothing, Moore lectured, "so embitters an inferior race as to know this." In the end, however, "it was the Englishman with his pure blood, his wife, his Bible, and his rifle who owned the continent, and not the Frenchman."27 To Moore, the South's aristocratic heritage with its characteristic devotion to a racial ideal made her far superior to New England's Puritan legacy with its blend of religious bigotry and ethnic infidelity. "My cavalier Scotch-Irish blood [has] never been fully reconciled to [the Puritan's] funda- mental belief that one should not kiss one's wife on the Sabbath day," he observed with humor, then added seriously: "My Scotch-Irish Presbyterianism still [resents] the fact that they hanged pious women for worshipping God in their own way." Although</page><page sequence="8">John Trotwood Moore 23 New England, like the South, early adopted slavery, Moore believed the Puritans became overly familiar with their chattel, leading them to adopt the "negroes foolish beliefs in witchcraft and sorcery." Little wonder, he mused, that New England had fallen from grace, mixed its blood with "the Latin, Slav, Greek, and Oriental," and become a haven for the perversions of "Bolshevism, . . . Communism, and Socialism." When an inquirer asked if the Tennessee State Library and Archives had any materials relating to Puritan influences in the South, Moore replied with force: "I am thankful to say that after a careful search I have been unable to find any written evidence that Puritanism ever got into the South. I sincerely hope that you may be equally unsuccessful."28 "Blood," Moore wrote to an Alabama friend in 1921, "is thicker than water but unlike water it rises even higher than its sources. There is no better blood, no better people than the descendents of that Anglo-Saxon stream . . . that flowed across the Carolinas, Virginia, Georgia, and Tennessee into Alabama." It gave the South her great families; it gave "Kentucky Boone, Shelby, Davis, Lincoln, Waterson, Breckenridge, and Buckner"; and it gave "Tennessee Jackson, Crockett, Sevier, Polk, Johnson, Farragut, and Forrest." From these people sprang the South's courageous line of gentlemen, and the greatest of all these was Andrew Jackson, whose estate the Hermitage graced Nashville's east- ern district. "Jackson was always a gentleman," Moore explained to the Ladies' Hermitage Association. "The secret of his fame . . . was not his generalship, but his gentlemanship. The first he acquired - the second was God-given." It flowed naturally from "the blood of the Anglo-Saxon."29 The glory of the Old South, Moore argued, rose from the symbiotic relationship between the gentle- man and his loyal bond servants. By nature a servile race, the African furnished labor, freeing his master to engage in the higher callings of states- manship, literature, and enterprise. In turn, the gen- tleman indulged his human charges, providing for them food, shelter, raiment, and the civilizing bene- fits of proper association with the Anglo-Saxon. "I love the negro for the gentleman he made," Moore reflected in 1925, "for the leisure he gave to Washington, Jefferson, Monroe, to the Old South that made their Generals, scholars, statesmen, judges." Properly directed, lectured Moore on an earlier occasion, the Negro is a "good natured, infe- rior man, a non-combative race, made for some pur- pose of labor, to be directed by a superior mind, and in his highest development an imitator." From his own experience, Moore believed the African fortu- nate to have settled in Middle Tennessee and the Black Belt of Alabama where he easily, though imperfectly, absorbed the virtues of life among the "better class of white people."30 Moore appreciated the leisured life that slaves and ser- VANTS PROVIDED. A FRIEND SHARED WITH MOORE THE PASSING OF "Aunt Betsy" in 1906, shown here with her "automobull, " - "SOON THEY WILL BE GONE, AND THERE CAN'T BE ANYMORE, ain't ita pity? " (John Trotwood Moore Papers, Tennessee State Library and Archives)</page><page sequence="9">24 Tennessee Historical Quarterly Considering slavery an ideal institution for the natural and proper exploitation of a lesser race, Moore resented northern abolitionists, deeming them hypocritical representatives of Yankee capital- ism. "The so-called sin of slavery," he explained in his memorial address on Jefferson Davis, was "invented by the commercial enemies of the South in order to place a moral turpitude on a brave and progressive people who had surpassed [the North] in progress, wealth and culture. [It] is a historical myth and an anthropological falsehood." Moore affirmed that the white South had given "the negro a greater opportunity" and treated "him with greater kindness and humaneness than ever did any white race of the past treat a conquered" people.31 Ignorant abolitionists pushed the South out of the Union, he fumed, forced it to fight for the preserva- tion of a just social order, and then crushed it with the North's superior material resources. In Moore's historical paradigm, the South - vanquished in armed conflict with the North - nonetheless won a grand moral victory. His literary works celebrated melancholy incidents of the Civil War, sad episodes in which a noble people retained its honor even though faced with certain defeat. Moore revered Sam Davis, Tennessee's "boy hero of the Confederacy," who chose death by hanging rather than betray a friend's confidence. When the Union general faltered at the fatal command, the youth manifested superior resolve. "Young Davis smiled, as calm and free / As he who walked on Galilee;" hymned Moore. "'Had I a thousand lives to give, / Had I a thousand lives to live, / I'd lose them - nay, I'd gladly die / Before I'd live one life a lie!' / He turned - for not a soldier stirred - / 'Your duty, men - I gave my word.'" First written for Songs and Stories of Tennessee, it struck a posi- tive chord among the pervadere of the "Lost Cause." Moore, who especially loved this poem, pleasured at its publication in anthologies on southern litera- ture and at its inclusion in school readers across the South.32 If the South manifested its honor in defeat, argued Moore, then the North proved its ignominy during Reconstruction. Far from magnanimous in victory, it inflicted upon the South, and particularly its aristocracy, the humiliation of restructuring its social order. Yankee traitors to their race forced Negro equality upon southern whites, raged Moore. The Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution thrust upon African Americans freedom, citizenship, and the franchise - rights and concepts they neither desired nor appreciated. "The three negro Amendments to the Constitution giving him citizen- ship and social equality," Moore cursed, was "a greater sin to him and to us than slavery itself."33 No longer subject to the peculiar institution's sagacious discipline, Moore affirmed that blacks easily gave into laziness and licence even as their so-called friends - the carpetbagger and the scalawag - subjected the South to an orgy of dis- honest government. At first, he reasoned, the "bet- ter class of whites stood aghast and helpless . . . and, for a time, maintained generally a sullen and bitter silence." But forbearance had its limits. These folk soon stood their ground, formed the heroic Ku Klux Klan, and redeemed the South from its tormentors.34 By the mid- 1870s, Moore rejoiced that the "white men" of the South "had thrown off the polit- ical yoke of the negro and the carpetbagger, and once more the Saxon ruled in the land of his birth." But it was a damaged dominion, blighted by war and Yankee perfidy. Negroes in particular had degenerated, corrupted by their "brief splendor of elevation." Demoralized and shiftless, they remained "true to their instinct," he claimed. "They worked only so long as they needed money. If one day's cotton picking fed a negro for five, he rested five." The "old-time negro is sui generis," Moore lamented. "The modern darky is no more like his ancestors . . . than the Greek of to-day resembles those who fought around the walls of Troy."35 Moore valued his idealized Negro: the indus- trious antebellum slave, the loyal body servant of Civil War fame, and the properly deferential "old darkey" of the post-bellum epoch. That African Americans might achieve social and political equal- ity with whites or might have ambition to be some- thing other than a domestic servant or menial laborer was anathema to his sense of proper deco- rum. Raging at the mockery of civilized conduct that he believed characterized contemporary blacks, he proclaimed in 1906 his equal distaste for "the blue-gum nigger with a razor in his boot-legs, hell in his heart and that odor of assafoetida [sic] ammo-</page><page sequence="10">John Trotwood Moore 25 nia and sulphuric acid under his arms that causes the chickens to drop from their roosts" and "the most pious, canting, ebon-faced preacher of them that ever sang his long-meter doxology while he passed around a short-metered hat."36 From Moore's perspective, the post-bellum generation of African Americans had grown up bereft of the quality training which the better class of whites had bestowed upon their slave ancestors. Unmindful of proper decorum in a civilized society, these blacks all too often lapsed into a lower stage of evolution, becoming at best petty thieves and at worse the ravagers of white womanhood. Moore - a trained attorney, the son of an Alabama judge, and the descendent of a United States Supreme Court justice - became one of the South's more strident advocates of lynching. While the "law of the courts and the civilized" sufficed for the cultured Anglo- Saxon, it had little value as a deterrent for the scions of Africa. "The law of the brute and the quick death by the body of his victim, before the small brain . . . forgets its crime, is the only law" fitted for the Negro fiend. Besides, Moore declared, "one lynch- ing kills the unborn breed of an hundred of them!"37 The reformer in Moore craved a revitalized southern patriciate, a resolute folk who would expunge every element of the North's alien culture, lead a regional renaissance, and initiate the rebirth of an idealized antebellum civilization. To him, the South's best people had been dispirited by war and downtrodden by Reconstruction. To be sure they had expelled the carpetbagger, suppressed the scalawag, and neutralized the African voter, but Yankee capitalism - without humanity or concern for the environment - had sunk its talons deep into the southern soul. The mill town, created for profit by New England adventurers, symbolized the con- summate evil bedeviling Moore's New South. Sanctimonious northern critics condemned the South's Ku Klux Klan for its alleged abuses of Negroes, he fumed, even as they conveniently ignored the Yankee-begotten cotton mills which In Moore's opinion, the only way to stop the crime of black-on-white RAPE WAS IMMEDIATE EXECUTION. IN HIS "EDITORIAL ETCHINGS" HE WROTE, "FOR THIS CRIME ALONE LET IT BE KNOWN OF ALL MEN THAT THERE IS NO COURT IN THE SOUTH" BUT RATHER LYNCHING. (The Taylor-Trotwood Magazine, November 1908) murdered its "white poor children." Compared to the "voiceless, swift-mov- ing Juggernaut of the child-killing cotton mill," Moore proclaimed in 1906, the "Ku Klux was the painted, grinning clown of a country show throwing rotten apples at a coon's head struck through a sheet."38 The Bishop of Cottontown, Moore's most popular novel, became his metaphor for the modern South. Set in an Alabama mill town just recovering from evil Reconstruction, it suffered under the oppressive rule of an anony- mous northern corporation. Moore wrote that "when the directors of a cotton mill, in a Massachusetts village, decided, in the middle '70's, to move their cotton factory ... to Alabama, they had two objects in view - cheaper labor and cheaper staple." They "did no unwise thing," he continued, "as the books of the company from that time on showed." But if New England profited, the South suffered. Yankee capitalists gladly employed children, subjecting them to heartless exploitation. In one piteous</page><page sequence="11">26* Tennessee Historical Quarterly scene, the foreman shook and kicked "the little tots," awakening them from their all-to-brief mid- day nap. "The little ones awoke instantly," Moore essayed, and stood "with stooped forms, and tired, cowed eyes, in which the Anglo-Saxon spirit of resentment had been killed by the Yankee spirit of greed."39 Edward Conway, one of the novel's more important characters, represented Moore's hope that a reborn aristocracy would once again assume its proper authority over the southern weal. The master of Millwood, a plantation gone to seed in the wake of Confederate defeat, he is introduced as "the type of the Southerner wrecked financially and morally by the war. His father and grandfather had owned" the plantation and Edward Conway "had gone into the war a carefully educated, well reared youth of twenty. He came out alive, . . . but, like many other fine youth of both North and South, addicted to drink." Conway sank into an state of extreme lassitude, unwilling and unable to counter Yankee crimes imposed upon his people. Late in In spite of the South's difficulties, an optimistic Moore saw nothing but a positive future for a prop- erly led South and, toward his life's end, he took comfort that its "best kind of people" had indeed reasserted their will. He placed his hope in this rejuvenated patriciate once more confirmed in its status and confident in its purpose. In September 1921, Moore returned from a sojourn to Greenville, Alabama, impressed by what he considered a model community of the restored South. "My visit . . . was a benediction," he confided to a friend. After an absence of more than three decades, he hardly rec- ognized "the pretty town with its well-paved streets, its splendid new schools, new houses, and Court House," and best of all, the new growth of beautiful trees that shaded its lanes. When Moore had last passed through Greenville, it, "like all towns in the South," was still "struggling in the after climax of war and destruction, of the rule of the carpetbag- ger." A refurbished Greenville, proclaimed Moore, stood as a shining monument to the uplifting quali- ties of the "God-fearing, honest people that have the novel, however, his daugh- ter - the epitome of southern female virtue - shamed him into repentance. He forsook the imprisonment of the bottle, pledging "white-lipped with resolve: 7 will be a Conway again!"' The reborn aristocrat heroically guided his Alabama community, fought the Yankee mill owners, and, in co-operation with others of his kind, created a model town beneficial to the southern people. Overseen by enlightened southern leaders, the inhabitants of the revitalized community owned their own cot- tages, sent their children to school, and, more often than not, engaged in the healthy exercise of agriculture rather than submit to the stifling drudgery of the fac- tory. This was a happy world characterized by the "laughter of childhood . . . and the glory and freedom of it all!"40 Moore 's novels and collected short stories were later reprinted by Cokesbury Press, who offered the complete boxed set of six volumes for $4.95. (John Trotwood Moore Papers, Tennessee State Library and Archives)</page><page sequence="12">John Trotwood Moore 27 made for the supremacy of the Anglo-Saxon race wherever they have stopped.'"" Moore's admirers, who considered him a leader among the patricians that created the docu- ments by which historians have traditionally assessed the South 's past, ranked him with contem- porary authors Thomas Nelson Page of Virginia, Thomas Dixon of North Carolina, and Joel Chandler Harris of Georgia. To be sure Page and Dixon shared both Moore's admiration for the southern patriciate and his disdain for what they considered Yankee and Negro venality, but Chandler partook of a different South. In common with Moore and Page he often created fantasies of southern blacks written in a stylized "Negro dialect"; unlike them he sympathized with the plight of post-bellum African Americans and with the social and economic struggles of the South's white under-class. Even as southern aristocrats extolled Chandler's quaint Uncle Remus tales with their anthropomorphic menagerie, they either ignored or were ignorant of his prose extolling the humanity of common whites. Moore, who considered Chandler's Uncle Remus stories appropriate litera- ture for children, deemed his own presentations of the stereotyped "old darkey" strong humor for adults. "I am sending you a book of my funny negro stories," he promised a correspondent who had requested he deliver a lecture in California, adding that he could easily develop an entertaining talk on the "pathos and humor of the old-time negro."42 Moore's writings with their praise of patrician values, their condemnation of Yankee civilization, and their explicit anti-Negro pronouncements fore- shadowed and, to some extent, influenced the next generation of Tennessee literati. The Vanderbilt Fugitives, and later the Agrarians, shared Moore's essential ideas and endeavored to perpetuate them well into the century. At the age of eighteen Merrill Moore, his son, became the youngest of the Fugitives, a coterie of professors and students dedi- cated to the exploration of literary styles. Coming together in the early 1920s, their circle counted among its number Donald Davidson, Allen Tate, John Crowe Ransom, and Robert Penn Warren in a loose association of a dozen or more poets and essayists who met regularly in the comfortable liv- ing room of Nashvillian James M. Frank. They spent evenings in literary feasts that lasted long into the night and that often included invited guests from among Nashville's larger intellectual community. Frequent among the latter was Merrill Moore's dis- tinguished father.43 Vanderbilt Professor Donald Davidson esteemed John Trotwood Moore as a worthy influ- ence upon the Fugitives. Growing up in Middle Tennessee, he recalled with pleasure that his own father purchased most of Moore's novels and enter- tained his family by reading them aloud. While as a literary critic Davidson found Moore's style largely untutored, he admired Moore's novels, essays, and poems as examples of Tennessee - and the South's - oral tradition. In his view Moore's works often appeared awkward in print, but became a delight when read before an audience.44 By the late 1920s, Davidson, John Crowe Ransom, Alan Tate, and Robert Penn Warren drifted from the Fugitives with their purely literary interest into a new fellowship collectively called the Agrarians. Drawn from a larger geographic area than the Vanderbilt community, they were a dozen socially concerned intellectuals bound together in a defense of their interpretation of southern civiliza- tion. Published in 1930, their fire-eating manifesto I'll Take My Stand promised "support of a Southern way of life against what may be called the American or prevailing way." Although the book received tremendous acclaim as well as condemnation at its printing and remains the focus of much scholarly investigation, its essential points were hardly new.45 The agrarian view was little more than a reincarna- tion of the thoughts of John Trotwood Moore, Thomas Nelson Page, and Thomas Dixon of the previous generation, and of Thomas R. Dew, William Harper, George Fitzhugh, and John C. Calhoun of the antebellum epoch. In 1957, Davidson grandly proclaimed that I'll Take My Stand had been a fervent defense of "the cause of civilized society . . . against the new bar- barism of science and technology controlled and directed by the modern power state." In that con- text, he averred, the "cause of the South was and is the cause of Western Civilization itself." Davidson, who feared "the modern power state," had just three years earlier been the chief founder of the Tennessee Federation for Constitutional Government, an orga-</page><page sequence="13">28 Tennessee Historical Quarterly nization opposed to desegregation on the principle of state rights.46 An unobstructed stream of southern thought flowed from Judge John Moore's stand against black jurymen imposed by Alabama's Reconstruction government to John Trotwood Moore's pronouncements on southern social rela- tions to Donald Davidson's intense opposition to Federally sponsored civil rights for blacks. John Trotwood Moore, Donald Davidson, and a host of other southern intelletuals had a vested interest in describing a society characterized by white supremacy. Faced with criticism from the lower classes, southern elites of the New South cre- ated a cultural paradigm that justified their control of politics, wealth, and the avenues of social advancement. From their perspective, their social class had enriched the South. Their enlightened leadership made possible an orderly community in which each group - free blacks, non-elite whites, and the elites - remained in its proper place. To be sure, social inequities existed. But the elites believed that their spirit of paternalism enabled the Negro race to achieve its "limited potential" unbur- dened by competition with "superior" Caucasians, and they assumed their practice of noblesse oblige gave lesser whites a lifestyle appropriate to their station. If funereal customs reveal the worth of the individual, then John Trotwood Moore ranked among Tennessee's more respected citizens. He died while writing at his desk on May 10, 1929. Upon learning of Moore's passing, Governor Henry Horton immediately ordered flags flown at half- mast, closed state offices for the funeral, and paid a special visit to Moore's grieving widow; the Ladies' Hermitage Associate sent to Moore's home flowers cut from the mansion's garden, a special tribute to the distinguished admirer of Andrew Jackson; and Nashville newspapers chorused their admiration for John Trotwood Moore, a gentleman in the tradition of the Old South who "worshipped gallantry and hardihood in men and beauty and sweetness of per- sonality in women." Thirty-eight honorary pall- bearers marched in his casket's wake; their number included the current and four previous Tennessee governors as well as an assemblage of the South's more distinguished citizens. In a touch symboli- cally fitted to the occasion, his active pallbearers were "ten negro porters from the Tennessee state capitol, whose uniforms, appropriately enough, were Confederate butternut gray."47 1 .

The issue of social class relationships in the antebellum South has long been debated by southern historians. Early in this century William Edward Dodd, a North Carolina-born professor of history at the University of Chicago, argued in his The Cotton Kingdom: A Chronicle of the Old South (New Haven, Connecticut, 1919) that slave-rich planters dominated the region's social, political, and economic institu- tions. A generation later one of his graduate stu- dents took exception to this. In his seminal work Plain Folk of the Old South (Baton Rouge, 1949), Frank L. Owsley assumed that the south- ern yeomen were rarely class-conscious and that social harmony existed between them and the aristocrats. Several students of the South support his view: Blanche H. Clark, Tennessee Yeomen (Nashville: Vanderbilt University Press, 1942); Herbert Weaver, Mississippi Farmers, 1850- 1860 (Nashville, 1945); Clement Eaton, "Class Differences in the Old South," Virginia Historical Quarterly 33 (Summer 1957): 357- 358; Forrest McDonald and Grady McWhiney, "The Antebellum Southern Herdsman: A Reinterpretation," Journal of Southern History 41 (May 1975): 166; Bruce Collins, White Society in the Antebellum South (London, 1985).

Thomas, The Confederacy as a Revolutionary Experience (Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, 1971), 102-105; Paul D. Escott, After Secession: Jefferson Davis and the Failure of Confederate Nationalism (Baton Rouge:, 1978), 94-135; Phillip S.

Events in Fayette and Shelby County in 1886 were typical of the Democratic Party's circum- vention of the electoral process. With more that two-thirds of its inhabitants African American, Fayette County normally gave Republicans a majority of 1,500 votes out of a voting popula- tion of 5,700. Sympathetic newspapers recorded that Democratic Party officials refused to open the polls in one heavily Republican district and rejected the ballots in another because of "irreg- ularities." That same year Shelby County Republicans claimed that Democrats forced blacks to leave the polls and neglected to count over 3,000 votes which they had managed to cast.

Smith's The Color Line, published in 1907. Smith, a professor at Tulane University, claimed proof that "the 'continuous germ- plasma' of the Caucasian race" enabled it to retain superior genetic elements denied in lesser peoples. Moore suggested that if "this book were read in every intelligent community North (for the South does not need it, except to know and understand why they have done naturally and with race instinct what Mr. Smith has demon- strated to be the true position from a scientific natural standpoint), it would change the entire view of those in the North who are sucking up this miscegenation poison into their veins."

When in 1906, President Roosevelt brutally punished black soldiers for their involvement in the Brownsville, Texas, race riot, Moore praised his friend: "With that great instinct for right doing and quick acting that will make him one of the great presidents of the Republic, Theodore Roosevelt put his knife to the exact spot where lies the cancer in the negro nature, when he dismissed with small shift the three companies of negro troops for refusal to give the name of the murderers in their midst.

Breastworks with abatis in front through which the mouth of cannon gaped; artillery and infantry on the right to enfilade; siege guns in the fort high above all, to sweep and annihilate But Hood's brave army never hesitated, never doubted." In September 1923, Hollywood director Allen Holubař recreated the Battle of Franklin on a hill side not far from the actual site as part of his project to develop The Bishop of Cottontown into a major motion pic- ture. Tragicly Holubař died shortly after filming the scene and the project was abandoned. No copy of the raw film footage remains.

Although Moore's admiration for the Confederate cause in general and his love for Sam Davis in particular coincided with the ethos of Sumner A. Cunningham and Edith D. Pope, editors of the Confederate Veteran magazine published in Nashville, he does not seem to have had any significant association with them. The magazine repeatedly praised Moore and his works calling him in 1910 a "true son of the South, imbued with her traditions and ideals."

"If the Fourteenth and Fifteenth amend- ments were repealed tomorrow, the negro in the South . . . would never let it be known that he had</page><page sequence="18">John Trotwood Moore 33 ever heard of it," Moore editorialized in 1908.

When Moore became director of the Tennessee State Library and Archives, he discov- ered a life-sized portrait of Reconstruction Governor William G. Brownlow. "It is badly dis- figured," he wrote with a twinkle, "because the Democrats used it as a cuspidor until it was removed and brought into the State Library." John Trotwood Moore to E. E.
