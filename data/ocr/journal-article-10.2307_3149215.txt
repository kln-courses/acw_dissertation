K.iHLER, of the University of Halle, and published in the Chronik der Christlichen W'Velt, Leipzig. No 21. (I) Christ has made the Mlikra/ (Canon) of the Jews a permanent factor in the history of mankind. (2) This has resulted from the fact that this Canon was his Bible until his crucifixion (John 19: 28; Matth. 26: 46) and after his resurrection (Luke 24: 25, 26; 44, 45), and for that reason also became the Bible of his messengers in all the congregations established by them. (3) The Old Testament collection of writings was one of the means pre- pared by God through which the Old Testament revelation became in reality a genuine essential in the development of the inner consciousness of Jesus Christ in the unfolding of the certainty of his Messianic calling, and in carry- ing out this principle as the object of his life's work. Especially did this Scripture serve him, in the midst of the Judaistic particularity of his age, to grasp in a vivid manner his earthly calling and to recognize the corresponding significance of his person. (4) His messengers have utilized the Old Testament especially for the pur- pose of demonstrating his Messianic character and work. In this respect prominence is given to this, that Jesus as the Messiah, i. e., as the Mediator between God and man, can be understood only on the basis of the Old Testa- ment development. This development, however, becomes a permanent factor only in its last results, namely, in the Old Testament collection as a whole. In this way this book or its contents continues to be a presupposition for the faith in Jesus as the Messiah. Without the Old Testament Christ and his mission will surely be misinterpreted. (5) Neither Jesus nor his disciples were through scientific research or other means prepared for, nor did they concern themselves in any way or manner about, the investigation of their Bible as the source of Israel's national religion. Rather they read this book as the revelation of the Father of the Lord Jesus Christ. They accordingly do not interpret it from the standpoint of the original author, in accordance with the historical principle, but solely in the light of God's fulfilment. The Old Testament for the Messiah-believers is the Scriptures in which God's Spirit or the Spirit as the Messiah testifies of his suf- ferings and his glory (I Pet. I:I i), which is the sum and substance of the revelation of God (Gal. 3:8, 22), and in which the experiences of the men and the people of God are recorded, not for historical purposes, but for the ben- 128</page><page sequence="2">SYNOPSES OF L1IPORTANT ARTICLES. 129 efit of those who shall live in later days (Rom. 4:24; I Cor. Io: II). They estimate and judge of the contents of their Bible from the standpoint of the Gospel. (6) The Old Testament collection is thus a part of the church's canon. This dignity is accredited to it (a) as a body of traditional revelations, (b) interpreted from a Christian standpoint. The "Christian" interpretation of the Old Testament is thus not "unhistorical" absolutely, but at most "unhis- torical on the basis of the historical principle of interpretation" (zeitgeschichtlich ungeschichtlich). It is historical from a higher standpoint (im grossen Stil). This point of view excludes the idea that Jesus presupposed the verbal inspi- ration of the Old Testament as this is also excluded by the various gospel tra- ditions in the New Testament. (7) We confess the divinity of Christ, who, however, in his days of humility assumed the form of a servant. Until his death, in work and favor he was the " Elect Jehovah." During this period, with the exception of his sinlessness, he claimed to differ from the prophets only in his knowledge (Erkentniss) arising from his peculiar relation to the Father (Matt. I 1:27 and the Fourth Gospel). If the divine nature in him submitted to all the limita- tions of the flesh in order to be like unto us (Heb. 2), why not then, too, to the limitations of the knowledge of such facts as can be discovered only through a regular course of continual research? His infallibility in revealing the Father does not arise from his secular knowledge, but his infallible judg- ment concerning the affairs of the world originated in his perfect knowledge of the Father. If some of his statements concerning matters of history and of nature turn out on investigation to be incorrect, this can invalidate the truth of his word as little as the dogma concerning creation, which has become a different one since it has been found that the world is round and not flat. (8) Of Christ's statements concerning the Old Testament we have only samples (Luke 24:27, 45 sq.). We accordingly cannot conclude as to his literal usage of the Old Testament. (9) In matters of history and literary estimate concerning the Old Testa- ment Christ nowhere departs from the current thought of his age. He did not criticise their views nor correct them. This is important for this reason, because he, as far as the contents are concerned, concedes to it decisive authority. Accordingly his method of viewing the Old Testament cannot come into conflict with the application of the historical principle. (Io) The New Testament references to the facts of the Old Testament pertain to the largest degree to prehistoric times, i. e., to times concerning which we have no historical data outside of the Old Testament itself. Of pre- historic times we cannot judge with scientific correctness until we have con- temporaneous evidences. (ii) Jesus found the revelations of the Father not in human opinions con- cerning God and his will, but in the acts which he considered as God's acts.</page><page sequence="3">130 THE BItLICAL WI ORLD. In this regard he must be an authority for us. According to his days the Jews not only thought to know certain things but did actually know them. Cf. also Matt. 22. (We do not ask the secular historian to regard Adam and Eve and the patriarchs as scientifically settled facts. We ourselves accept the earliest traditions down to Moses. But we do so because the antitype guarantees to us the type (Rom. 5:14), and the revealed name of God guarantees the patri- archs, of whom the God who reveals himself is not ashamed). (12) The historical method of studying the Old Testament has this service to render to the Church- --to make her conscious that her establishment on the great historical facts of the Scriptures is independent of submission to purely human traditions or researches, which vary at all times. (13) The purely historical method of studying the Old Testament taken alone must either acknowledge the insolvable mystery in Christ or it will mis- understand and misinterpret this mystery (2 Cor. 3: 15, 16). (14) Not the Jesus of this earth, but the perfected and preached Christ (Luke 24: 46, 47), is the fulfilment of the Old Testament covenant, certifying to its contents and complementing these. The authority of the two portions of Scripture treating of him accordingly does not originate alone in the histori- cal traditions concerning him, but is established on his work through his repre sentative, the Paraclete. The address has both a representative and an individual value. The author is a protagonist of that conservative school in Germany which believes that modern criti- cism has done some good work and that some concessions must be made to it. The discussion treats of the burning question in Protestant Germany and shows how a defender of a pronounced evangelical type of biblical study adapts some of the newer views to his positive convictions.. G. H. S. FLORILEGIUM PHILONIS. By C. G. MONTEFIORE. The Jewish Quarterly Review, April, 1895, pp. 481-545. I am not going to tell the ordinary things about Philo's life and environ- ment, nor shall I attempt the slightest account of his philosophical system as a whole. My object is to pick out and arrange from the great mass of the Philonic writings certain salient thoughts and sentences worthy of notice. Philo borrowed many ideas from others, Greek philosophers. His doctrine of the Logos is based upon Heracleitean and Stoic teaching; in almost every part of his religious and ethical writings he is under obligations to the Greeks. Most of what we admire in Philo today is fundamentally Greek rather than Hebrew; Greek philosophy, colored, modified, transfigured by Hebraism. If Philo is often striking, it does not follow that he is helpful. It is in grand generalities that he excels; his ethical details are few and disappointing. He is deeply imbued with the characteristic yearnings of mysticism. He is always tremendously in earnest in his great quest, viz., the knowledge of God.</page><page sequence="4">SYNOPSES OF IMPORTANT ARTICLES. I 3I With him it is a religious passion; yet he seeks this knowledge by philosophic means, through metaphysics rather than through goodness; and yet he is also convinced that God always will be unknowable, or rather known only in part. In Philo's mind we find the constant yearning to know God and the abiding conviction that he is essentially unknowable. The specific statements in the Pentateuch are allegories, except the ethical statements, which stand true as they are. What then are Philo's ideas about God? What strikes us above all is his doctrine of the divine ubiquity; he is desperately anxious to maintain, and if possible, to explain at once the transcendence and the immanence of God. Though God remains immovable in his omnipresence, yet his power may be manifested with varying intensity in different plans. The omniscient Deity is naturally conceived as supremely perfect; all sufficient to himself; what- ever is most desired and excellent in humanity is only fully realized in God. Philo's God is not only a god of thought, as with Aristotle, but also a god of goodness, as shown in his creation of and relation to the world. This goodness is essentially ethical, equivalent to God's grace. He does, however, not venture to say that God created also what seems to us evil. He next discusses the theory of divine benefits and punishments, which latter are entrusted to certain subordinate ministers and agents. But this does not explain the problem of evil. More interesting is his theory that God's grace and his punishments are proportionate to the nature which has to enjoy the one or to suffer the other. In the creation of man God looked to the capaci- ties of the recipient. The biblical anthropomorphisms are an accommoda- tion to human weakness and human needs. These their cause, their purpose educational. Philo associates a low intellectual conception of the divine nature with an imperfect morality and an imperfect service of God. The passions and diseases of the soul are at once intellectual and moral. To Philo, no less than to the author of the Fourth Gospel, the two are inextricably blended together. As anthropomorphic beliefs are connected with the fear of God, so the love of God with the truer, more spiritual conception of the divine nature. Yet there is no absolute gulf or difference of kind between man and man. Lack of opportunity may often account for lack of visible excellence. Opportunity is, if not divine, at least the companion of Deity. Every kind of life may be dedicated to God. This is a corollary of his favorite theory, that all our faculties and powers, as well as our surroundings and possessions are the gift of God, and in no wise our own. He has an appre- ciation for the honest failure in the quest of highest good. The search for God is the life-work of man; to reach the goal, there are two fundamental requirements: the first is repression of body, of pleasure, and imperfection, manifesting itself as error and wickedness; the second is a particular kind of humility. In Philo there lurks a measure of asceticism; how much cannot be exactly determined. As God needs nothing, so the good man's needs should be few</page><page sequence="5">I 32 THE BIBLICAL WORLD. and simple; this is to be near to God. Yet there is false as well as true asceti- cism; the former is niggardly and illiberal. The right use of external goods is highly commended. Licentiousness and intemperance should be put to shame by moderation and sobriety. Philo denounces the false Stoics and hypocritical ascetics. The service of man must in all cases precede the unin- terrupted service of God. We must work our way through the "practical" life before we come to the life of contemplation; the contest of the one must precede the higher contest of the other. It is thus we can escape the charge of laziness and indifference. The service of God is not identical with the service of man, but has a spe- cial sphere of its own; if noblest, it is also hardest. The perfectly virtuous are exclusive lovers of neither man nor God ; they excel in both at one and the same time. In his more sober moments Philo recognizes the social nature of man. Alan is a social animal by nature. He must live for and love the world and God, that of God he may be beloved. In his statement on solitude and social intercourse Philo is rather incon- sistent, because he cannot get over an abiding contempt for the multitude and their vices. Solitary wisdom of the rapt theosophist is higher than the gregarious wisdom of human action. But not always has he found solitude efficacious to thought. In the ascetic ideal Philo is very wanting. No explanation of sorrow, no comfort in misfortune and misery in his writings. Here the Psalter, Epic- tetus and Seneca excel him by far. The life which depreciates the body and exalts the soul is true life. We not only need a kind of life,but also a mental attitude; more precisely a particular kind of humility, primarily intellectual in its character, merging into and including moral humility; its opposite is self-conceit in the mental sphere and selfishness in the moral. The Stoics applied this self- conceit to the intellect only, Philo gives it a specially religious meaning. In this he differs from Epictetus and Seneca, their conceptions of God being dif- ferent from his. Philo opposes the Stoic independence, that man is the son of God, because he is part of an omnipresent and undivided reason; to the Jew man is the child of God. The Stoic, true to his principles, does not acknowl- edgre because he does not feel the need of direct aid from God to man. In this also Philo differs, he realizes the need of God's assistance; with this comes the prayer for it, and with the prayer the assurance of response. To the Stoics, man's independence, though in the last resort a gift, is yet strongly marked. Man must recognize his own divinity, and so find his salvation and his strength. To Philo the sense of man's dependence is never wanting. God gives to the individual as well as to the kind, and what he gives he can withhold. Self-conceit is the parent of forgetfulness, ingratitude, and self-love; only when you know yourself do you realize God. No religion without humility. No service of God without a sense of the nothingness of man. This humility does not involve fear, but rather confidence to supplicate God. Since everything</page><page sequence="6">SYNOPSES OF IMPORTANT ARTICLES. 1I33 is the gift of God, we should use these gifts to good purpose. The ethical effects of humility are the right of our possessions and consolation over their eventual loss; the effects of self-conceit in these cases are licentiousness and grief! The selfish man has a whole list of vices appended to his special fault; the man who "attributes all things to God" has all the virtues. Occasion- ally Philo alludes to repentance which indicates a possible passage from the category of evil to the category of good. Repentance can soothe conscience, that stern and unbribable judge. Conscience with Philo is primarily the "convicted." Against men's will it stings them into confession of their evil deeds; it is born with the birth of the soul, unsusceptible of wrong. Philo iden- tifies conscience with the divine Logos. In one sense it is, as it were, the cause of sin, as well as the cause of well-doing, for without its presence in the soul no erroneous action could be deserving of blame, and sin would therefore be impossible. How is God within man ? By virtue of his mind, every man's contains an impression, or fragment, or ray of the divine nature. The mind sharing the perfection in the universe, whenever it contemplates the cosmos, widens with the limits of the universe. Human reason is of divine origin; yet God only dwells in the souls of the good, shows his divine influence. This real divine influence, by the law of God's relation to his human kinsman, is granted to those who are fitted to receive it. There can be and there is, a scale of increasing divine immanence which culmi- nates in inspiration. Again God helps man, both in moral effort and in the acquisition of knowledge, culminating in the knowledge of God himself. Teaching, training and nature must each have its proper share in the acquisition of virtue; all three must work together, although one factor may predominate. Man is given help by the divine Logoi who walk in the minds of those who are still not wholly cleansed of error and of sin, the divine thought. The Logos helps those who are akin, or inclined to virtue, and when it calls the soul to itself, freezes together its earthly and appeti- tive elements. In virtue, as in knowledge, God meets the sincere suppliant half way. He fertilizes virtue by sending the seed from heaven. The same office is also assigned to the Logos. Philo is of the opinion that men have won a belief in God through what we now call the argument from design. His aim is to approach as near as he can to God as he is himself, apart from what he may be inferred to be from his works. Of course he admits that God cannot be comprehended; he is not even apprehensible by the mind, except only as to existence. As ruler and creator, God is stamped straightway as all-powerful and good; his two main names, Lord and God, typify his ruling and his goodness. A still higher aspect of God is that of the Logos, the reason of God in every phase and form of it that is discoverable or realizable by man. The appre- hension of the Logos is the highest stage in the knowledge of God which is obtainable by ordinary man. Nevertheless God is above the Logos, and</page><page sequence="7">134 THE BIBLICAL WtORLD. there is a possible realization of him, which transcends all that even the Logos can suggest to us. Only a very chosen few can advance beyond the Logos. These are the inspired minds, such as Moses. It is to the "perfect'" alone that "the first God" can be revealed. Inspiration, if given by God, must be prepared by man. Yet this highest condition of the mind is pure passivity; the human is blotted out to receive the divine. There are two main attitudes of the mind with which God is regarded: fear and love, corresponding to the Deity's two fundamental powers. These together with the Logos (which is the first) are the first three of the six great divine powers. In man fear and love must be combined, or there should be that perfect love which knows honor, but is ignorant of fear. Yet higher than all these qualities in man are the knowledge and adoration of God for what he is. According to these should be man's religion. The highest attitude towards God, which corresponds with the highest conception of him, might perhaps be more rightly called adoration than love. Philo is quite sound and prophetic on the relation of outward form to true religion. Not that he wishes to break from forms. On the contrary he is a strong conservative. Just as we must be careful of the body, as the house of the soul, so must we give heed to the letter of the written law. He emphasizes the true relation of ritual to religion. The service of God can only be that of praise; for God, unlike a human master, has no needs. It is the glorious distinction man has received above all other animals. Philo's conception of faith is equally high with his conception of God's worship. Faith is not the condition or beginning of virtue, but its goal; it is not opposed to knowledge; it involves trust; faith in the Creator implies, as its correlative, unfaith in the creation, unfaith in self. If the serv- ice of God brings with it a perfect faith, it also includes a perfect freedom. The service of God is sought for itself, and its rewards are spiritual. The more glorious the subject-matter of a command, the less need for externa reward. Some characteristics of Philo's conception of the highest life are these: Hope is the seed of which faith is the fruit. It is therefore the most char- acteristic quality of the human soul; the good life should be hopeful. A second characteristic of the perfect nature is joy, typified and symbolized in Isaac; true and genuine joy is only found in the virtues of the soul; the wise man rejoices only in himself, not in his environment. Therein joy differs from pleasure. A third characteristic of the noble life is peace; true peace is the prerogative of God and of the worshiper of God. It is on these high generalities of the ideal life that Philo is wont to dwell, and in these he most excels. In ethics neither student nor preacher will gather much from his pages. Montefiore's exposition of Philo's teachings and philosophy is excellent indeed. and he who wishes fully to appreciate it must read the article as a whole. It is to be hoped that another, similar expos6 on Josephus may soon follow this florilegium, which I am convinced, would find as eager readers as this present contribution. W.

TERRY, in The Journal of Biblical Literature, Parts I. and II., 1894. Pages 9I-Ioo. The author assumes the unity of the Apocalypse, and accepts the work as the genuine production of John, the disciple of Jesus. The mixture of Jewish and Christian elements, alleged by the recent hypotheses of Vischer, Voelter, Spitta, and others, is but the abundant appropriation of Old Testament imagery made by a Jewish-Christian disciple who had listened to the teaching of the Lord " as he sat on the Mount of Olives over against the temple" (Mark 13:3). The theme of the Apocalypse is identical with that of Jesus, as reported in Mark 13 and the parallels in Matthew and Luke, when, in answer to the disciples' question, he spoke of the sign of his coming and of the end of the age. Again and again the writer assures us that his revelation is of "things which must shortly come to pass." The mystery, propounded as a riddle in 13: 18 and 17:9-II, is most easily explained by dating the book in the reign of Nero, and before the commencement of the war which ended with the overthrow of Jerusalem. There is no teaching of our Lord more clearly recorded in the synoptic gospels than that the Son of Man was to come in his kingdom and glory before some of those who heard him speak should taste of death (Matt. 16: 28, Mark 9:I, Luke 9:27). And unless the language of Matt. 24 and its parallels in Mark and Luke are an unfortunate patchwork of misleading statements, Jesus most positively declared that his coming on the clouds of heaven would accompany, or immediately follow, the woes of the ruin of Jerusalem. The ruin of the Jewish metropolis and temple was destined to mark the end of the pre-Messianic age, and the inaguration of a new dispensation of the kingdom of God. In strict accordance with this doctrine of Jesus, the great theme of the Apocalypse is announced in chap. 1:7, in language appropriated from Dan. 7 :I3 (cf. Matt. 24: 30) and Zech. 12: 10o: "Behold he cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see him, and they who pierced him, and all the tribes of the land shall mourn over him." This coming is about to take place, and the time is at hand. The scope of the Apocalypse of John is, therefore, the overthrow of apostate Judah and Jerusalem, and the consequent establish- ment of Christianity in the world. These things are set before us in great symbolic pictures, the imagery and language of which are appropriated almost wholly from the Hebrew Scriptures. The book may be divided into two nearly equal parts, chaps. I-II and 12-22. Most praeterist expositors make the catastrophe of the first part refer to the fall of Jerusalem, and that of the second part to the fall of pagan Rome. But the second part of this revelation is, like the first, a prophetic picture of the fall of apostate Judah, and the establishment of the new kingdom of Christ. As Joseph's dream of the sun, moon and stars making obeisance to him was in substance but a repetition of his previous dream of the sheaves in</page><page sequence="9">136 7'HE BIBLIC4L WIORLD. in the field (Gen. 37:6-9); and as Pharaoh's double dream of the seven kine and the seven ears was repeated unto the king twice in order to deepen the impression and assure him that the thing was established of God and shortly to come to pass (Gen. 41: 32), so the second part of the Apocalypse of John is but another presentation of the same subject as the first part. Chaps. 5-1 I reveal the Lamb of God under various symbols, glorious in power, opening the book of divine mysteries, avenging the martyred saints and exhibiting the fearful judgments about to come upon the enemies of God. Everything is viewed as from the throne of the king of heaven, who sends forth his armies, destroys the murderers of his prophets and burns up their city (cf. Matt. 22: 7). The second part reveals rather a picture of the church [the woman clothed with the sun, etc.] in conflict with infernal powers and worldly principalities, surviving all persecution, triumphing by the word of her testimony, and, after the fall of Babylon the harlot, appearing as the New Jerusalem, the wife of the Lamb, glorious in beauty and imperishable as the throne of God. Chaps. I-II therefore contain the Revelation of the Lamb, and chaps. 12-22 the Revela- tion of the Bride, the wife of the Lamb. This theory of the Apocalypse differs from current expositions in several important particulars: (I) it recognizes, with the most explicit teaching of Jesus, that the fall of Jerusalem and its temple was the signal event which marked the end of the pre-Messianic age. The ministry of Christ in the flesh, and that of his apostles who founded the Christian church, fell within the latter days of the old dispensation. It was necessary for them to preach the gospel of the kingdom "in the whole world for a testimony unto all the nations" (Matt. 24-14) before the old cultus gave place to the new. The explanation of Matt. 24: 14 as a prophecy of the evangelization of the world during the period of the kingdom of Christ, has been the source of error and confusion. (2) It holds that there are not two great cities which perish, but only one, which in this book is charged with the blood of saints and martyrs. " The great city" of I i :8 is specifically designated as the city where the Lord of the two witnesses was crucified. The two witnesses are best understood as representing the apostles and prophets, who preached the gospel as a witness unto the nations before the end. This great city, guilty of the blood of the witnesses (cf. Luke 13: 33), is no other than the great Babylon, the mother of harlots, drunken with the blood of saints and martyrs, as described in chaps. 17 and 18. (3) The error of making this Babylon a symbol of Rome is manifest; it contravenes the analogy of biblical symbolism to portray a pagan city under the figure of a harlot; Rome was never in covenant relations with God so that a prophet could say of her as Isaiah (1:21) said of Jerusalem, " How is the faithful city become a harlot ! " (cf. also Ezek. I6, 22, 23). Again, if the beast is the Roman Empire, as most expositors maintain, the harlot should be some other city than the metropolis of the empire, for how can it be truly said that any kings represented by the ten horns of that beast hated Rome and burned her utterly with fire (17: 16) ? For the kings or potentates</page><page sequence="10">SYNOPSES OF IIPORTANT ARTICLES. 137 of the Roman Empire to destroy the city of the Tiber, as represented in these symbols, is both incongruous in thought and untrue in fact. Further, the notion that the "seven mountains on which the woman sitteth " (17:9) are the seven hills of Rome, the septem colles of the Latin writers, is a misleading fancy. So specific a designation would, in this connection, be scarcely in keeping with the demand made for "the mind that hath wisdom." The mountains are no more to be understood literally than the waters of vs. I and the scarlet-colored beast of vs. 3; for, according to the vision, the woman sits on many waters, on the beast, and on seven mountains. The four heads of Daniel's symbolic beast (Dan. 7:6) were not indicative of four hills on which a metropolis was builded. And lastly, the description of vs. 18, "the great city which has a kingdom over the kings of the land," may apply to Jerusalem as well as to Rome, for in I1: 18 Jerusalem is the " great city," and in New Testament usage "kings of the land" is a phrase applied to such rulers as Herod and Pontius Pilate (Acts 4:26, 27). (4) It maintains that the angel of the abyss, named Abaddon and Apollyon in 9: I, is the same " as the beast that comes up out of the abyss " in I 1:7 and kills the two witnesses. He is also the "great red dragon " of 12: 3, "that old serpent, called the Devil and Satan," who "gave his power and his throne and great authority " to the beast that was seen to come up out of the sea. The great red dragon as well as the Roman world-power is, accordingly, to be recognized in the "scarlet-colored beast " on which the harlot was seen sitting (17: 3); and in the enigmatical statement of 17 :11, "the beast that was and is not" is evidently the same infernal spirit who is referred to in the eighth verse as " about to come up out of the abyss, and to go into perdition." The thought of the writer seems for the moment to be more upon the infernal "beast that cometh up out of the abyss" (cf. 11:7) than upon the empire which he appropriates for the persecution of the seed of the woman. Hence it is said that he "is himself also an eighth and is of the seven." Each successive emperor is conceived as an incarnation of the great red dragon. (5) It does away with the so-called " Nero-myth." (6) The one great catastrophe of both parts is the downfall of the great city which was for a thousand years the metropolis of the Jewish people. In the visions of John this great Babylon, drunken with the blood of saints, is seen to fall and give place to the coming and kingdom of him who is called Faithful and True, the Word of God, the King of kings, and Lord of lords. He is seen to triumph over all his foes, even over Death and Hades, and the consummation of his millennial reign is the descent of the New Jerusalem to the new earth, and the making of all things new. New interpretations of the Apocalypse are always in order, and Professor Terry presents his exposition of the book after thorough study of Jewish apocalyptic litera- ture and at a ripe period of scholarship. His exposition deserves the full abstract which is here given. That the theory is right in the general view of the book which it</page><page sequence="11">I 38 THE BIBLICAL I WORLD. takes may be asserted with some confidence. The pr~cterist interpretation of the Apocalypse is (with Diisterdieck, Ewald, Farrar, Liicke, Maurice, Reuss, Stuart, Weiss, Weizsdicker, and others) to be preferred. The Revelation pertained to and realized its meaning in the Apostle's own age; in the destruction of Jerusalem and the condition of the Roman Empire of the first century; the prediction that Christ would then return, and the consummation of all things be brought about, was then unfulfilled because it rested upon the misconception which prevailed throughout the primitive church that the return of Christ would be in their own generation, and would immedi- atelv follow the overthrow of Jerusalem. So that the Revelation throws no light upon the future of Christianity other than that it will sometime triumph, and a new era of bliss will follow. This is only what we already knew from Christ. Even on the spiritual theory of the book, that it is a true predictive history of the church, giving a conspectus of the great epochs and the governing principles of the church in its development from the beginning to the end (the view of Godet, Lee, Randall, Simcox. Vaughan, Warfield, and others), Professor Milligan, its ablest English exponent, abandons any peculiar predictive element in the book, saying: "It [the Revelation] gives no knowledge of the future that is not given first by our Lord, and then by others of his inspired apostles." Professor Terry may or may not be right in his interpreta- tion of the details of the book --that remains to be seen after the discussion which the above paper will awaken has issued in some consensus of opinion among scholars for or against the new view --but the important fact has received new emphasis that the Apocalypse of John (does not give us any information about the future which the gospels do not give.
