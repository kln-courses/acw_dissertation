<plain_text><page sequence="1">Destiny or Descent?: Responses to Darwin JAMES HARRISON "In the course of centuries the naive self-love of men has had to submit to two major blows at the hands of science," observed Sigmund Freud, whose own work was to deal the third and possibly most wounding blow; "The first was when they learnt that our earth was not the centre of the universe, but only a tiny fragment of a cosmic system of scarcely imagined vastness— The second blow fell when biological research destroyed man's supposedly privileged place in creation and proved his descent from the animal kingdom and his ineradicable animal nature."1 That the theory of evolution did in fact lead to a major change in man's perception of himself would seem to be only too obvious, just as the impact of Darwinism on the literature of the period would appear to be already more than adequately documented. In reading the studies of critics like Lionel Stevenson, Georg Roppen or Leo Henkin,2 however, with their pain staking cataloguing of references to contemporary geology, biology and evolutionary theory, one has the sense of counting trees and missing the wood. If the scattered allusions which they cite represent the sum total of Darwin's impact on the literary imagination, then one must conclude that this impact has been surprisingly superficial. Dreams whose origin or mean ing are clearly discernible are seldom the most significant, and the very overtness of many of the allusions cited in these studies argues against their having arisen out of any very lasting or profound change in the writers' Mosaic XIV/1 0027-1276/81/010109-16$01.50 ® Mosaic</page><page sequence="2">110 James Harrison sensibilities. Few of the sources from which these critics draw their examples, furthermore, can be regarded as masterworks of the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. Butler's Erewhon, Meredith's "The Woods of Westermain" and Bridges' The Testament of Beauty can scarcely claim to be representative—in any way comparable to Middlemarch, "The Scholar Gypsy" and The Waste Land—ot the creative imagination interacting with the spirit of the times. In one of the shorter studies of this subject, indeed, Walter J. Ong argues that : "The influence of Darwin upon the poetic and artistic imagina tion has become a commonplace... yet, surveying the work of the creative imagination today, one is struck by the slightness of creative drive connected with an awareness of evolution, cosmic or organic. It is not that poets refuse to accept evolution. They render lip service to it. But it does haunt their poetic imagination."3 Almost reprovingly, as he surveys poetry from Darwin's time to the present, Ong comments that, "in the last analysis, the poet and artist are not very much at home in an evolutionary cosmos," preferring the merely cyclical, repetitive patterns of time appropriate to earlier cultures, or retreating into lost Edens and Joycean epiphanies. The first concern of this essay, therefore, will be to examine at some length at least two major reasons why artists have not responded to Darwinism, or have done so contentiously or contrarily. In turn my objective will be to demonstrate that many more writers than one might suppose have been influenced by Darwin, and influenced profoundly, but in ways which Ong and his predecessors have not considered. And as a preliminary to both lines of argument, it will be necessary to differentiate between evolution in a general sense and evolution by means of natural selection— something which Ong, significantly, does not find necessary. It is easy to see, of course, why he does not. For we are all well aware that, in general parlance, Darwin is credited with the discovery of evolution rather than a particular evolutionary mechanism. We are even aware that such a misattribution reflects a very real truth, in that it is the fact of evolution's having taken place, much more than the precise manner in which it did so, which has changed man's view of himself and his place in the universe. Darwin's major achievement so far as Sigmund Freud and humanity at large are concerned, therefore, is quite rightly perceived as his having given the theory of evolution a credibility which his grandfather and Lamarck and Robert Chambers and many others before him had failed to do. Nevertheless, for Ong to refer to Darwin's influence on poets and artists, and then not even to mention natural selection, is, to say the least, to preclude his investigating one of the main reasons why "the poet and artist are not very much at home in an evolutionary cosmos." For it is clear that the evolution Ong is talking about is both far wider in scope and far more teleological than Darwin's. (Just how teleological may be gauged from the fact that his favorite evolutionary bards are Teilhard de Chardin and,</page><page sequence="3">Responses to Darwin 111 impossible as it sounds, Hopkins.) Yet it is equally clear that, for many, evolution as a whole took on a much less teleological, much more disturb ingly mechanistic quality from the very fact that Darwin became its most authoritative advocate. Thus the first "influence" exerted by Darwin to occupy our attention will be the negative response which the theory of evolution occasioned. One can illustrate such a reaction most clearly by comparing the poetry about evolution written by Tennyson and Browning before 1859 with what they wrote on the subject after that date. As early as 1835 Browning published, in the final scene of Paracelsus, a paean of praise to progress in which, "from life's minute beginnings, up at last / To man," God partici pates almost pantheistically, tasting "an infinite joy / In infinite ways," in a triumphantly continuous and above all teleological process. Mankind is, of course, the consummation of this scheme Of being, the completion of this sphere Of life, whose attribute had here and there Been scattered o'er the visible world before, Asking to be combined, dim fragments meant To be united in some wondrous whole.... The process is by no means finished, moreover: all tended to mankind, And, man produced, all has its end thus far: But in completed man begins anew A tendency to God.4 Even more startlingly teleological is a passage from Tennyson's The Princess (1847). Princess Ida, discussing with the Prince the evolutionary implications of some fossilized bones, and answering his question as to whether one dare think of God and his creation as a "workman and his work, / That practice betters," has this to say: To your question now, Which touches on the workman and his work, Let there be light and there was light: 'tis so: For was, and is, and will be, are but is; And all creation is one act at once, The birth of light: but we that are not all, As parts, can see but parts, now this, now that, And live, perforce, from thought to thought, and make One act a phantom of succession: thus Our weakness somehow shapes the shadow, Time—5 Everything is so completely foreordained that, from a divine point of view, outside time, evolution is instantaneous.</page><page sequence="4">112 James Harrison The contrast between these poems and those written after The Origin of Species (or, more importantly in Browning's case, The Descent of Man) is marked. Browning in "Francis Furini" (1887), for instance, testily attacks evolution as quite unequal to accounting for man's moral nature. And Tennyson, emerging from long Arthurian silences on the subject, has Edgar, the melodramatic villain of The Promise of May (1882), use natural selection to justify his total and ruthless hedonism. 'As flies to the Gods; they kill us for their sport'.... The Gods! but they, the shadow of ourselves, Have past for ever. It is Nature kills, And not for her sport either. She knows nothing. Man only knows, the worse for him ! for why Cannot he take his pastime like the flies? And if my pleasure breed another's pain, Well—is not that the course of Nature too, From the dim dawn of Being—her main law Whereby she gains in beauty—that her flies Must massacre each other? (Works, VII, 268-69) In order to place in its true perspective such acceptance of evolution but dismay at Darwinism, we should remind ourselves of some of the many other leaders of nineteenth-century thought who came to accept the evolutionary hypothesis, and did so in most cases thanks to Darwin, but who nevertheless found natural selection alone to be an unsatisfactory or insufficient explanation of the whole process, and particularly so at the human level. Darwin himself include scattered traces of Lamarckianism in his work, especially in later editions of The Origin of Species as he tried to meet more and more critical objections. And A. R. Wallace, co discoverer of natural selection and more steadfast than Darwin in defending its unaided efficacy in accounting for all forms of life up to man, was to find the human brain—so little smaller in prehistoric than in modern man, so very much larger in all men than in apes—to be far in excess of early man's needs and therefore explicable only in terms of a presiding, guiding intelligence aware of future needs.6 Even T. H. Huxley, Darwin's most trenchant champion, was adamant in his refusal to allow that natural selection is in the least relevant to the social and moral life of man. The practice of that which is ethically best—what we call goodness or virtue involves a course of conduct which, in all respects, is opposed to that which leads to success in the cosmic struggle for existence. In place of ruthless self-assertion it demands self-restraint; in place of thrusting aside, or treading down all competitors, it requires that the individual shall not merely respect, but shall help his fellows; its influence is directed, not so much to the survival of the fittest, as to the fitting of as many as possible to survive. It repudiates the gladiatorial theory of existence.7</page><page sequence="5">Responses to Darwin 113 As for Freud, that ardent admirer of Darwin, he remained an unrepentant Lamarckian to the end of his days, mainly because a mechanism wholly dependent on chance, as Darwin's was, did not seem to lend sufficient support to his psychological theories. Thus as late as 1916, concerning an abortive project to link psychiatry and Lamarckianism; he wrote: "Our intention is to base Lamarck's ideas on our own theories and to show that his concept of 'need', which creates and modifies organs, is nothing else than the power unconscious ideas have over the body."8 Russell, Huxley and Freud, then, in their different ways, found natural selection insufficient to account for the relatively narrow field of man's mental processes. Herbert Spencer's case is almost the reverse. That he accepted the concept of natural selection is clear enough ; the very phrase "survival of the fittest" is his, not Darwin's. Moreover, unlike Huxley, he had no inhibitions about extending its application to the affairs of man. He was among the earliest and most notorious of those social Darwinians who saw it as necessary, for the health of society, that the weakest should go to the wall. But Spencer had advanced an evolutionary or "development" hypo thesis of his own as early as 1850,9 and in 1857, a full year before Darwin and Wallace unveiled their theory of natural selection to the Linnean Society, he outlined its vast scope (as later elaborated in his multi-volumed life's work, Synthetic Philosophy), and also its universal theoretical basis: "From the earliest traceable cosmical changes down to the latest results of civiliza tion, we shall find that the transformation of the homongeneous into the heterogeneous, is that in which Progress essentially consists."10 This doctrine of ever-increasing heterogeneity is clearly far more wide-ranging and far more fundamental to Spencer's thought than is natural selection. Its very universality, one suspects, supplies some of the same reassurance which a divinely ordained teleology did in the case of Tennyson and Browning. For Spencer, too, Darwin was not enough. Not unlike Freud, but going a stage further, Schopenhauer found even the mechanisms of Lamarck, as Nietzsche did those of Darwin, to leave insuf ficient scope for the operations of the Will or Will to Power.11 "Will," to Schopenhauer and Nietzsche, however, is universal or cosmic in nature— more analogous to the mysterious "Force" which even the mundane Spencer acknowledged to underlie existence. It also clearly has much in common with Bergson's élan vital. And in Bergson's L'Evolution créatrice one sees made quintessential^ manifest a post-Hegelian, post-Darwinian need to devise some process of development which can steer a middle course between the Scylla and Charybdis of teleology and mechanism—a need which, in the end, can be met only by incorporating the transcendent within the process, and positing a kind of immanent teleology. In thus investing his élan vital with at least some of the properties of an absolute, moreover, Bergson creates a new theology which is as fundamentally anthropomorphic as any of the old theologies. For the touchstone of progress, of the general upward direction given things by the élan vital, is the presence or absence</page><page sequence="6">114 James Harrison of consciousness, which Bergson finds plants to have abjured and animals to have embraced.12 Finally, in Teilhard de Chardin (who at times reads like nothing so much as Pascal rewritten by Herbert Spencer and Bergson), the covert teleology Bergson never acknowledges is given full scope, and at the same time consciousness is predicated in an even more attenuated form as far back as the atom. In short, in all the above writers there is a feeling that Darwinism allows no scope for individual will or effort, and/or provides no overall sense of purpose or direction sufficient to account for or satisfy the sense of purpose it led to in man. The two features most often sought as at least a supplement if not an alternative to Darwinism are, therefore: some kind of Lamarckian auto-teleology operating at the level of the individual organism (shades of Samuel Smiles's Self Help, 1859), and some overriding principle or force to provide an assured and universal upward thrust. Both such quests find expression in literature, and do so most obviously in the writings of Samuel Butler and George Bernard Shaw. Butler's early and enthusiastic conversion to Darwinism seems almost immediately to have been undercut by his satire of Darwinian mechanism, in "Darwin among the Machines" (1863). Two years later, however, in "Lucubratio Ebria," machines are no longer the creatures which may well prove fitter than man to survive, but the evolutionary adaptation ("mechanical limbs") which will assure his future progress. Eventually, in the writings of the discredited Lamarck, Butler was to find a theory of evolution which allows each individual organism the dignity of participating in the process of development of which it forms a part, and which was to give him the scope to develop his own belligerently unique theory that heredity and indeed life itself are a form of memory. "Life is that property of matter whereby it can remember. Matter which can remember is living; matter which cannot remember is dead."13 Such a theory led him to speculate that the separate identity we consider to be each organism's birthright may be an illusion, and even to flirt with a strange kind of biological monism : "We therefore prove each one of us to be actually the primordial cell which never died nor dies, but has differentiated itself into the life of the world, all living beings whatever being one with it, and members one of another" (Life and Habit, IV, 70). Always, however, something of the irreverent iconoclast in him, some reflex mistrust of the pretentious, saved him from taking himself too seriously, or ever consistently espousing a cosmic vitalism such as Bergson's. He preferred, it seems, to search for a law rather than a force, an explanation than a myth. Shaw's case is both clearer and more complex, his much more vehement dislike of natural selection, with all its stupid, blundering, "non-vegetarian" cruelty, its "ghastly and damnable reduction of beauty and intelligence, of strength and purpose, of honor and aspiration, to such casually picturesque changes as an avalanche may make in a mountain landscape, or a railway accident in a human figure,"14 is largely, one feels, a fastidious mistrust by Shaw, the rationalist, of life's irreducible physicalness, its messy, unpre</page><page sequence="7">Respo nses to Darwin 115 dictable, irrational uglinesses and beauties. But there is a Romantic side to him as well: so strongly was he influenced, through Wagner and Nietzsche, by a continental line of thought which virtually bypasses Darwin that his "Life Force" turns out to be a kind of simplistic, painting-by-numbers version of Bergson's élan vital,15 with even a common emphasis on mind as the ultimate outcome of the whole process. Both Shaw and Butler found it difficult, however, to express their evolutionary gospel in other than polemic form. For one thing, as Back to Methuselah illustrates, it is hard to show perfectibility within the time-span of a conventional novel or play, whereas a poem like Swinburne's "Hertha" is bound by none of those spatial or temporal limits that cramp the chronicler of individual lives. Undoubtedly too, it was because Swinburne was so much younger than either Tennyson or Browning when The Origin of Species first appeared, that he was much better able to accept its shocking implica tions, and even to enjoy using his earth-goddess personification of the impersonal forces of the universe to underline, through blasphemous paradox, the primacy of pure matter. I am that which began; Out of me the years roll; Out of me God and man; I am equal and whole; God changes, and man, and the form of them bodily; I am soul. Before ever land was, Before ever the sea, Or soft hair of the grass, Or fair limbs of the tree, Or the flesh-coloured fruit of my branches, I was, thy soul was in me. First life on my sources First drifted and swam; Out of me are the forces That save it or damn; Out of me man and woman, and wild-beast and bird; before God was, I am.16 As the poem proceeds, however, the iterative and insistent use of this first-person form of personification makes it as hard for the reader of Swinburne as for the reader of Bergson to ignore a subliminal sense of teleological intent. Thus, in the closing stanzas, evolution is linked to man's increasing purposiveness. For truth only is living, Truth only is whole, And the love of his giving Man's polestar and pole; Man, pulse of my centre, and fruit of my body, and seed of my soul.</page><page sequence="8">116 James Harrison One birth of my bosom; One beam of mine eye; One topmost blossom That scales the sky; Man, equal and one with me, man that is made of me, man that is I. The word "soul," which at the beginning of the poem was used paradoxi cally to assert the primacy of matter over spirit, now has a double meaning: that which has produced the seed, or man (i.e. matter), and that which shall spring from the seed (i.e. spirit, purpose). Thus an evolutionary process which has no purpose, but which cannot be embodied in poetic myth with out seeming to have one, thereby actually acquires one to the extent that it produces a purposeful creature. And, as in Bergson, the conscious ness of the end-product infiltrates the earlier stages of the process from which it evolved. In many ways Meredith is even more in sympathy with Darwin than Swinburne. He acknowledges and even celebrates, in a poem like "Hard Weather," the impersonal processes of selection by which nature brings out the best in life. She winnows, winnows roughly; sifts To dip her chosen in her source; Contention is the vital force Whence pluck they brain, her prize of gifts.17 But he is also much more insistent than Swinburne that brain is nature's "prize of gifts," as he is on the mother-son relationship between "Earth and Man," which he expresses in the opening lines of that poem in charac teristic mammary imagery: "On her great venture, man, / Earth gazes while her fingers dint the breast / Which is his well of strength" (Poetical Works, p. 240). Thus, ostensibly, "only for the numbers Nature's care / Is shown, and she the personal nothing heeds" ("The Test of Manhood," Poetical Works, p. 541). But in fact Meredith's recurring and almost complu sive need to personify earth (whether as mother to man, or as the widow who takes him as her second mate) confirms his poetic vision of earth's finding, in man, the means "To speed the pair unto her goal of goals." It is even more impossible for Meredith than for Swinburne to render the nature of impersonal purposelessness in other than the language and imagery of personal, purposeful relationships. Perhaps, in their earth-mother myths, Swinburne and Meredith are fending off the twentieth-century's need of the antimyths of Kafka, Beckett and Borges. This thought is particularly apposite as we turn to the poetry of Hardy. For, of all the literary figures alive when The Origin was published, Hardy is the one most gloomily aware of the fact of Darwinism and of the fortuitous and often "crass" nature of its mechanism, which gives no assurance that the worthiest shall survive. In The Dynasts, for instance, the Ironic Spirits report :</page><page sequence="9">Responses to Darwin 117 He of the Years beheld, and we, Creation's prentice artistry Express in forms that now unbe Tentative dreams from day to day; Mangle its types, re-knead the clay In some more palpitating way; Beheld the rarest wrecked amain, Whole nigh-perfect species slain By those that scarce could boast a brain.18 In a number of early lyrics Hardy actually personifies the powers-that-be under such names as Crass Casualty or Doom. Then there are those in which Dame/Mother Nature is either unconcerned or powerless to improve matters, or in which God himself is equally, though by implication more culpably, indifferent or forgetful. Finally, in The Dynasts, Hardy settles on the Schopenhauerian "Immanent Will" or "It." Conscientiously, repêatedly, he insists on "Its" unaccountability as mere process for what "It" brings to pass. Yet as a tongue to a hollow tooth, Hardy returns again and again, in his poetry, his novels, his letters and his notebooks, to the need he feels for someone or something to blame: "He, she, had blundered. But not as the Prime Cause had blundered. He, she, had sinned; but not as the Prime Cause had sinned. He, she, was ashamed and sorry; but not as the prime Cause would be ashamed and sorry if it knew."19 Moreover, in Hardy as in Meredith and Swinburne, there is a suggestion that with the coming of man dawns the possibility of consciousness and purpose informing the whole evolving system : Thou arguest still the Inadvertent Mind, But, even so, shall blankness be for aye? Men gained cognition with the flux of time, And wherefore not the Force informing them, When far-ranged aions past all fathoming Shall have swung by, and stand as backward years? ( The Dynasts, p. 522) Hardy retracts this vain hope some time after 1914.20 But however despair ingly or fleetingly, he does voice the same need felt by Schopenhauer and Bergson and de Chardin—and Swinburne and Meredith—to extend some human attribute of will or mind or consciousness beyond man himself, back ward in time and/or outward into the personified process as a whole. Humankind cannot bear, it seems, cannot even articulate very adequately, ultimate mechanistic reality. Language itself is so permeated with the per sonal as almost to prelude our talking about such a situation, let alone writing poetry about it, without some metaphoric lapse—such as the covert teleology of a phrase like "natural selection."21 And language both molds and mirrors the nature of mind.</page><page sequence="10">118 James Harrison So far, then, we have noted reactions to Darwinism by a variety of British authors who, while accepting the idea of evolution as proposed by Darwin (or retaining a preDarwinian acceptance), are dissatisfied with or hostile toward its exclusive reliance on the chance-directed mechanism of natural selection. Even where, as in the case of Swinburne and Meredith, there is an ostensible, nay glad acceptance of a purely physical, mechanistic universe, this attitude is at silent odds with a sustained and unmistakable reliance upon personification which results in a poetic rendering of some thing far closer to Bergson's vision than Darwin's. Had we examined American poetry over the same period, we should have found no less an insistence on purposeful evolution, though perhaps a less acute awareness that this was in conflict with Darwinism. As F. W. Conner expresses it in Cosmic Optimism: "Far from espousing any theory of mechanism, thus, [sic| what Whitman was concerned to do—like Emerson, Poe, and nearly all the poets we shall consider—was to pour the old wine of divine purpose into the new bottles of evolutionary 'process.'"22 Indeed, the only national literature in which writers (of an admittedly somewhat later generation) seem to have become reconciled to, if not exactly at home in, a Darwinian—as distinct from a merely evolutionary cosmos, is Canadian literature. Darwinism, to writers like Charles Roberts and E. J. Pratt, is much more a matter of struggle and harsh indifference than millennial amelioration. But this has doubtless more to do with the quality of man's encounter with nature in this northern environment than with anything else. It is personal experience with climate and geography rather than philosophic awareness which makes Canadian writers accept what Tennyson jibes at, Meredith seeks to soften, and Hardy pronounces judgment on. But this subject deserves the much fuller treatment it has received elsewhere.23 To return therefore to the more representative authors I hâve been considering, I would argue that while well aware that they are living in an evolving cosmos, these writers combine such an awareness with a belief in, a wish to believe in, or a longing to be able to believe in, a greater degree of teleological trustworthiness than is provided by a purely Darwinian mechanism. Furthermore, one should bear in mind that evolution is far from being centrally important to the work of writers like Browning or Swinburne, and that those poems of Meredith and Hardy or polemic writings of Butler that deal with evolution, are far from being what we most value in their work today. Thus, in the final analysis, we are left agreeing with Ong that evolution (and certainly Darwinian evolution) does not seem to "haunt their poetic imaginations," and that to a large extent "recurrence" remains the "foundation of poetry and art."24 Indeed, I would now go further than Ong and argue that the cosmic model underlying a good deal of major writing in the century following Darwin is not so much cyclical as degenerative or counter-evolutionary. A fair case could be made for this from no more than the general feeling</page><page sequence="11">Responses to Darwin 119 of unease, of all's not being right with the world, that recent reassessments of the Victorians have emphasized. But science itself, early in the decade of The Origin of Species, provided an exact counterbalance to the apparent optimism of evolution in the second law of thermodynamics. This, the precise antithesis of Spencer's grand principle of ever-increasing herero geneity, states that energy, though never lost or destroyed (first law), gradually becomes unavailable as it dissipates itself more and more uniformly or homogeneously, and thus presents mankind with a model of the universe running down like a clock, or dying of entropy. One can neatly illustrate the potential here for inverse symbolism by referring to two poems by James Thomson. In the early poem, "The Doom of a City," evolution to some extent lightens the gloom: Life is only by perpetual on-flowing; Torpid rest is the true life-devouring death; Through stern struggles all things ever are upgrowing; Sighs and moanings prove a vital-throbbing breath.25 In the more famous later poem, The City of Dreadful Night, however, life is seen wholly in terms of entropy, of the slowing-down of the cyclical process: Take a watch, erase The signs and figures of the circling hours, Detach the hands, remove the dial-face; The works proceed until run down; although Bereft of purpose, void of use, still go. (Poems, p. 181) With Thomson, of course, we are still in the foothills of literature. But consider what J. Hillis Miller has to say of Bleak House: "Inhabited by immanent determining forces tending irreversibly toward their dissolution, the characters disintegrate, just as Grandfather Smallweed collapses 'like some wound-up instrument running down' and just as his daughter 'dwindled away like touchwood' The self-enclosed life of the characters of Bleak House is, then, not a mechanical repetition. It is a clock that runs down, something organic which has died and decays, the entropy of an enclosed system approaching the maximum equilibrium of its forces."26 In the twentieth century, there is a case to be made for "West-Running Brook" as a kind of epitomizing consummation not only of the volume that bears its title but also of all Robert Frost's output, and this at least in part because of its depiction of life, and indeed the whole of creation, as a continuing and brave but relatively minor "throwback" or reversal of the prevailing current of entropy. Finally, one might observe that the overall slide toward stasis and silence in Samuel Beckett's plays (to say nothing of a title like Endgame) is almost a staged enactment of entropy. Such random instances do little more than indicate that the spirit of the post-Darwin era has not uniformly been of a kind best reflected by evolu</page><page sequence="12">120 James Harrison tionary or millennial imagery—that entropy, in fact, whether overtly invoked or not, is often a more appropriate scientific analogue of what the writer wishes to express. But are we necessarily to assume that a Darwinian evolutionary model is millennial —that Darwinism and entropy are so precisely antithetical? We have seen how most works of the imagination employing a millennial or progressive model are to some extent anti Darwinian. And we have also glimpsed how the human imagination has felt the need of, and utilized, a powerful anti-millennial model or analogue in entropy. Could it be that Darwin's main impact has been in the latter direction? I am not, of course, denying that Darwin's portrait of a world governed by natural selection reveals a succession of life-forms which, viewed as a whole, appears progressive. I am, perhaps, questioning how reassuring this really is insofar as the future is concerned. Darwin himself acknowledged that fitness to survive may in some cases entail what from an anthropo morphic point of view seems to be degeneration. And man has, of late, given poets and others enough cause to suspect that, in nature's long view of events, he may become as necessarily expendable as the dinosaurs. Moreover, those who most vociferously claimed Darwin as a prophet of human progress—i.e. the social Darwinians—were in fact, though they did not realize it, of another party. For, as A. R. Wallace argued early and cogently, once man had evolved a brain, further bodily evolution by natural selection became unnecessary, since he could more rapidly and economically meet new needs by devising new tools and techniques than by evolving new physical attributes.27 And as Sir Peter Medawar has in our time elegantly extended the argument, with the development of language, acquired charc teristics in the form of skills and knowledge can after all be "inherited."28 Human evolution is therefore, strictly speaking, Lamarckian, and we can achieve our own apotheosis, or destruction, without any help from Darwin. Much more important than any doubt to be cast on what Darwinism may have to say about the future, however, is the degree to which it points us to the past. Not that retrospection is to be identified with retro gression. But at least they share a common orientation. A backward-looking Darwinism and a sense of entropy might very well co-exist, peacefully and fruitfully, within the puzzled mind of man. At all events, it is in relation to the past rather than the future that I see Darwinism as having had by far its most profound effect on the human imagination. Here, on the home ground of both literature and myth, and within the closed system of what has already happened, Darwinism has helped enable man to create new models and myths, or to recast old ones, by which to comprehend and conduct his existence. The very titles of the books he wrote should, of course, have alerted us: The Origin of Species and The Descent of Man. Their own direct, literary effect on the reader, moreover, is lingeringly if unavoidably retrospective, evoking interminable vistas of the earth's geological history and of man's</page><page sequence="13">Responses to Darwin 121 tribal prehistory. And they mark, by what may seem a strange irony but in what I am suggesting is a causally appropriate manner, the watershed between a century which saw the main emphasis of human thought placed on progress, and a succeeding one during which, with the possible exception of Marxists, Western man has been more preoccupied with his origins than with his destiny. Following on Darwin, this search for origins and lines of descent was spearheaded by Frazer, with his vision of the childhood of man, and Freud with his of the childhood of men. Both drew on Darwin's later work, and Freud drew on Frazer's, seeing in childhood behavior a recapitulation of primitive, tribal behavior. In Freud's wake, moreover, there came Jung, whose concept of a racial unconscious furnished with archetypes has been virtually appropriated by students of literature. Finally we have ethologists like Tindbergen (Social Behaviour in Animals) and Lorenz {On Agression) who would have us see ourselves and our behavior reflected and only slightly distorted in the ways of our animal forebears. The effect of such a trend on literature and the arts is all too obvious: the sense and weight of the past in Proust and Joyce, and the backward, inward, analytic turn taken by the novel since then; the parallel rise of autobiography as a literary form; narratives written from the point of view of children, primeval man or even animals; the highly self-conscious use of archetypal symbolism in modern poetry; the fascination of the primitive for painters and musicians alike; world capitulation, virtually, to the rhythms of jazz and rock. Perhaps the most telling instance of this atavistic turn of mind is Conrad's Heart of Darkness. And perhaps that work illustrates most clearly of all why Darwin's influence has been retrospective rather than prospective. For, in emphasizing man's primitive and indeed animal ancestry, and at the same time depriving him by means of evolution's self-sufficient mechanism of natural selection of a teleologically assured future, Darwinism underlines the precariousness rather than the promise of his present position. We penetrated deeper and deeper into the heart of darkness. It was very quiet there.... We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth, on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet. We could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance, to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil. But suddenly, as we struggled round a bend, there would be a glimpse of rush walls, of peaked grassroofs, a burst of yells, a whirl of black limbs, a mass of hands clapping, of feet stamping, of bodies swaying, of eyes rolling, under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage.... The prehistoric man was cursing us, praying to us—who could tell? We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings; we glided past like phantoms, wondering and secretly appalled, as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a mad house. We could not understand because we were too far and could not remember, because we were travelling in the night of first ages, of those ages that are gone, leaving hardly a sign—and no memories.</page><page sequence="14">122 James Harrison Thus Marlow describes a penetration deeper and deeper into the darkness, but dissociates himself from what he sees. Yet, in the very next paragraph, he acknowledges with some dismay the discovery to be made at the heart of such darkness. The earth seemed unearthly. We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster, but there—there you could look at a thing monstrous and free. It was unearthly, and the men were— No, they were not inhuman. Well, you know, that was the worst of it—this suspicion of their not being inhuman. It would come slowly to one. They howled and leaped, and spun, and made horrid faces; but what thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity like yours— the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar. Ugly. Yes, it was ugly enough; but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise, a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you—you so remote from the night of first ages—could comprehend. And why not? The mind of man is capable of anything—because everything is in it, all the past as well as all the future.29 Clearly, given the time that has elapsed since the appearance of The Origin, the influence of Darwin on recent writers is largely indirect, mediated to them through numerous intervening minds. Clearly, also, there are many other factors at work. Nevertheless, his work must be seen as constituting a crucial turning point. Freud, for instance, is insistently clear that Darwin's ideas, and in particular his removal of the barrier between human and animal life, played a major orienting role in his own life, and made possible the advances in human thought for which he was responsible.30 But Freud, it will be remembered, saw Darwin's impact on human self-perception not as a liberation from cyclical time, but as a blow to man's amour propre—though ultimately an educative and in that sense liberating blow. And as such, its effect would clearly be to turn man in on himself, and to direct his attention toward that which has made him what he is, rather than toward that which he may become. Eighteenth- and early nineteenth-century belief in human progress was based on human progress, in the main technological, not on biological theories of evolution. Indeed, human progress predisposed naturalists to think in terms of biological progress rather than the reverse. The brief boost given to man's millennial view of himself by Darwinism proper, in the writings of social Darwinians, was based on a false analogy and has proved no match for the factors which have since induced men to despair of man's capacity to improve. This has left the true, lasting influence of Darwin on the human imagination more apparent. And the effect of this influence, ironically has to a large extent been to turn men's minds back to lost states of barbarism or innocence, and to intensify—in a way that might at first sight seem totally unDarwinian—the sense that everything man does he has done before, or everything he has done before he is capable of doing again.</page><page sequence="15">Responses to Darwin 123 NOTES 1/ The Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud, trans.

Wilkinson, in "From Faraday to Judgement Day," ELH, XXXIV (1967), 225-47, detects in the same novel references to entropy, to magnetic fields of force, and to a popularized version published in Household Words of Faraday's lectures on the combustion of a candle. However, though entropy was first propounded by Carnot in an unpublished notebook of 1824, the idea did not become generally known until reformulated by Clausius in 1850 and Thomson in 1851 (H.T. Pledge, Science Since 1500 [London, 1939], pp. 142-44). So Dickens in Bleak House (1852-53) may have been expressing the spirit of a law of whose letter he was still unaware. 27/ Wallace, pp. 312-14. 28/ P. B.
