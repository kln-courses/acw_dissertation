<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SYNCRETIC CREED OF HELLENIZED JEWS FROM TANAIS (NORTHERN BLACK SEA REGION) IRMA HAYNMAN Tanals, a major trading center at the Don River mouth, from IV BCE to IV CE flourished on land and sea routes (Strabo 9.2.3), connecting India and China with western world.[13; 16,28; 38,15-23] Since VII BCE the Black Sea north belonged to Royal Scythians, with the suggestive self - appellation "Gerri" (Herod. 4• 56,71) [17], who borrowed from Ashkelon Thrace their cult of Atargatis/Kybele - Attis/Papai (Herod. 1.105,4.5-10,59),[14,322] with the sacral marriage of king* priest with the Great Mother traced to Cimmerians-Amazons. [32, 181; 31,107] In V BCE Greek colonies of the Crimea and Taman Peninsula united into Bosporan Kingdom, a competitor of Egypt in the world grain market.The Kingdom was ruled by hellenized Scytho-Thracian dynasties,with the official cult of Aphrodite Urania Apatura - Astarta, with the main temple near Hermonassa. [19.6-9; 24,8-25. 617 fn; 31, 115-116] The Tanais foundation in IV BCE coincided with the dedication of statues to "great gods Astara and Sanerg" by Comosarye the Queen, [6,no.1015; 35, 86-93] and the emergence of clay figurihes of horsemen. [32,181] The incorporation of Tanais into the Kingdom in I CE almost coincided with the reports on the first influential Jewish communities well documented for several Bosporan cities.[6,430 fn] They are attested by their inscriptions, sometimes in Hebrew,and by menorah, ram -horn, palm branch, or citron executed on the burial stones of their cemetries. [9,59-71] The religion of Tanais was conventionally rendered, since Movers, from the Phoenician Tanit-Pane-Baal Haman.[27,1.622 -29;38] But when in Tanais and other cities the dedications to nameless Hypsistos were unearthed, Schuerer rendered the ritual phraseology as the "Jewish with certain features of Christianity", but described the cult as "neither Judaism, nor paganism but a neutralization of both". [37,225] Dubnov emended the formula into "neither Judaism nor Christianity" [11,153] Following Schuerer, scholars approach the Bosporan 53</page><page sequence="2">IRMA HAYNMAN Theos Hypsistos as identical for all the cities, though the only deity in Tanais.Thus Goodenough characterized the cult as hellenized Judaism,[12,232] Nadel as local Judaism, [29, 23] and Levinskaja as "originated in the Jewish milieu"[20] Katsarov rendered it as Ba'alism, [16,118] and Tacheva-Hitova suggested a local syncretism of the Judaized Zeus -Sabazius influenced by the Jews of Tanais and Bosporan Kingdom. [41, 142] Ustinova denies the Jewish influence on Bosporan Theos Hypsistos and, explaining the cult as "Sarmatian", extends the term to the creed of Royal Scythians and Saka. She sees the Bosporan guilds as military bodies introduced into the Greek milieu by the influx of Iranian nomads. [45, 150-180] However,contrary to literary tradition, in the Tanais Delta archaeology reveals only the scanty traces of Sauromatians/ Sarmatians - controversial terms lacking definite ethnical meaning. [39,60-65] Our starting position is that the Tanais creed was distinct from other forms of Bosporan Theos Hypsistos, whose divine title could have belonged to Judaism and Christianity, but could also describe Baal, Zeus, or Sabazius. But the guilds of this deity have existed only in Tanais, and only there we find the terms "adopted brothers" and "god fearers"(here rendered in the direct meaning) while neither manumissions, nor "proseuchi" are mentioned[cf.20;45] In our treatment we intend to correlate archeological data, literary tradition, and epigraphy with the cult Symbols and images. I. Archaeological data have shown that at all times Tanais was a non-Greek city: no features of hellenistic cultural life found up to I CE, when on the town site appeared Greek inscriptions and coins.But there were multiple figurines of Bes, Bah, frogs, phalluses, grape bunches, and the like, of Egyptian provenance. During the seven centuries the burial practices followed the same pattern: there were no coins, or inscriptions, Greek stelas, or terracotes. [38, 84 -95] Neither were there specific Sarmatian features: horse gear, accompaning food, armament in women's graves, etc. [38, 94] Poorly adorned corpses accompanied with objects of everyday life were placed on their backs mostly in wooden coffins in narrow ground graves often marked with the stone poles at their ends, or with circuits out of uncut stones. One of the anthropomorphic stones dated in the last centuries BC had an equilateral triangle. The burials are mostly east - oriented,which is not characteristic for either Meotians or Sarmatians. In. the first century a group of north-oriented burials,usually connected with Jewish diaspora, appeared. A unique for the Black Sea north small cemetery containing only children's burials, dating in II - IV, was found under 54</page><page sequence="3">THE SYNCRET1C CREED OF HELLENIZED JEWS FROM TANAIS the town wall [38,88] Out of 320 burials excavated only one was definitely Greek, three others had some local Iranian features[38,48no.13&gt;90-94nos.21,30,82] At all times at this site swine were tabooed, contrary to the Iranian and Greek customs elsewhere in the region. [44,281,285] II. Literary sources call the Tanais inhabitants either the "Hellenes", or the "Tanaits" (Steph.Byz.s.v. Tanais; Strabo 7-4.5, 9• 2.3;Pto 1.3• 5• 24;Pliny IM 6.20) ;Amm.Marc.31 •3.1 .), while according to epigraphy they fell into socially equal "Hellenes" and "Tanaits"[6,nos.40,1242,1243,1245,1249,1251] No ethnical or religious distinctions between these groups have ever been established. [18, 116-118] Pliny (NH 6. 20) informs, that the Carians, Clazomenians, and Meonians were the first colonizers.The legend supplied by Plutarch (Lib, de fluv.14.1) on Tanaos son of Berossos and Amazon Lysippa that lusted after his own mother and threw himself into the Amazon River, which since then was called after him. This temple legend common in the Great Mother worship represents her fusion with the male partner manifested as the youthful deity. Iamblich Drammatic (Erot.scrip.Graeci, 9)states that the mysteries of Aphrodita at her temple and■ at Tanais are "the mysteries of Tanais and Pharsyris", meaning "with the shining face", that is, the solar partner of Tanit-Pne-Baal Haman. [3,53-56;21,27,1.626-628] According to Herodotus (1. 216) the Massagets sacrificed horses to Helios, their only deity, Maximus Tyranius (8.8) calls this deity "Tanais". III. The cult artifacts from Tanais are, as follows: a) The stela found in 1913 and published by Knipovich in 1947• The common pattern inscription reads,that a guild headed by the priest celebrated the Day of Tanais on 12 Apelaeus, 104 CE, for the eighty-ninth time, thus the initial date falling in 15 CE.The relief with a standing horse and the bare-headed, long-haired and bearded horseman in the barbaric costume, armed and holding a rhyton in his right hand, which makes him a priest-king. His hand with a rhyton points to the blazing stone altar placed under the tree.[18,116-118,fig44 cf•42;4,no.1259;5,200]b)The lime slab with a lion trampling on bull's head executed in relief, in the like manner. [18, 87,fig.42] c)In 1968 Boltunova published the stela with the inscription on fortification repairs and the bust relief of a goddess,identified by her as Great Mother- female partner of Theos Hypsistos.[5»46-55] d)A relief of the holding fish Anahita - Astarta - Tanit was published by Kobylina in 1978 [19,24-26;21,100,191 ] e) A fragment of the terracotta altar with a goddess, dated in II CE. [2,106] f) And, finaly, two cellar shrines,which provided a hearth and incense burners, lamps,a terracotta eagle,stamps with eagles clawing snakes, 55</page><page sequence="4">IRMA HAYNMAN all dated In III. [45,179] III. The earliest dedication (in the first dacades of I CE) to Theos Hypsistos, was made by Bion and Theodorus sons of Phann "delivered from the gravest perils". [5,6,no.1316] The twenty inscriptions of the guilds follow the identical pattern:after the dedication formulas to Theos Hypsistos,or Theos Hypsistos epyxos, the names of magestrates (a priest, a pater synodou, a synagogos) and members are appended. The "Jewish" (Azarion, Kzegodi, Sabation) "Greek", or "Iranian" names are equally distributed among them. The guilds fall into three categories: a) Those headed by Theos Hypsistos have neither decorated their stelas, nor chatacterized them as "votive",or mentioned king's name.[6,nos.1278,1280,1282] b)The guilds headed by the priest sometimes decorated their votive stelas with eagles and garlands,and mostly mentioned king's name [nos1260-1264,1277,1279,1284,1288] c)The guilds of god fearing adopted brothers,according to Tacheva-Hitova the Jewish immigrants, headed by elders, mostly decorated their stelas,"votive" or not, with eagles and garlands, and always mentioned king's name.[nos.1281,1283,1285,1286,1292] With the random time sequence, 13 names appear both in the guilds of the first and the second categories, and 12 names from the first category and 8 from the second category are also mentioned as "adopted brothers". Besides twice appear: in the first category 2 names, in the second 5 names,and as the adopted brother 1 name. Xophrasmos, who is mentioned on the stela with the Great Mother, also appears as a priest and high official in the guilds of the first two categories [nos.1277-1279] The analysis shows: all the guilds belonged to one cult characterized by the circulation of devotees in the guilds of each category, which explains their puzzling instability,when out of sixty members mentioned in no.1278, after five years, in no. 1279, only two remained. The "Day of Tanais" relief, with Tanais being the male form of Tanit, can safely be rendered in relation to the Canaan Poenician ritual of the wanting and waxing sun festival, during which Baal Shamem/Haman vanishes in self-cremation (or otherwise) to be regenerated as god-king-priest. This guild having belonged to our second category, the horseman represents the local variant of priest-king,[32,180-181] in the process of deification through amalgamation with newly born sun symbolized by the fire.The eagles, as solar birds, like phenix, well agree with the cult in question. The role of Mother Goddess in the solar cult having been diminished, she is manifested as a tree, while her powers symbolized by her name are transferred to the horsman. On the other side, 56</page><page sequence="5">THE SYNCRETIC CREED OF HELLENIZED JEWS FROM TANAIS her sole images agree with her position as mother/wife for the two male manifistations of the single deity. L3,53-56; 25,138-197J Then, the first guild category corresponds to the three-in-one deity, namely, the fusion of goddess-lover -son,the second to the fusion of father-son-king, while the third category guilds represent the people,־ as the "adopted brothers" of the deified king. The scene is reproduced on royal diadems of the kings from the dynasty of Aspourgos, while both the Great Goddess and horseman appear on their coins, L31,115J which allows to relate the date on the stela with an actual historic event. In ca. 14, King Rescuporis I son of King Asandroxos, in his lifetime, was deified as the sun-god under the cult name Aspourgos.The cult of Aspourgos is related to the religious and military organisation of the "Aspourgians" settled near Hermonassa on the Aspourgian Island. His royal sign=tamga, appears on coins and ritual cups from the Aspourgian Island as the two four-zig lines joined with a straight line, L30, 106-121 fig.3J which resembles the sign of goddess Kybele, representing the sky and Earth union through the son-king. Aspourgos belonged to the Arsacides - Royal Scythian family from the Tanais River region,the other branches rulled over Parthia, Arminia, the Kushana Empire (Strabo 11.9.2). The Arsacides worshiped Anahita/Tanit,claimed divine origin and called themselves "brothers of the Sun and the Moon". Their dynastic title, written by them in square Hebrew characters as 'arasak, means "betrothed" 126,121;33,321;14,27-29J More complex design of their dynastic tamga,as the symbol of the goddess flanked with horses, was used by all the branches of the Arsacides.L10,67,71 tab.6,73 nos.255-58,74543,47-48J The name Aspourgos for many centuries well attested for the region is conventionally rendered from the Akkadian -Syrian "aspuraku" for "horseman" (cf. Iranian "aspa" for "horse"). [14,43,45-47) However, Tolstoi paralleled "Aspourgians" and "Christians" as followers of Aspourgos (of Christ) and held that the original form should have been the ancient Iberian name Aspaurouxis. Having in mind that for the Caucasus the cult of Anahita/Tanit is regestered since XVII-XVI BCE L28, 20-2bJ we can render this two-stemm name from the Semitic roots in relation to hag ha'astf -"Festival of Ingethering" (Ex. 23:16, 34:22), the annual feast celebrated for seven days in time of the winter solstice. The second stemm being bar'a - "create", as blHaka - "the day of your creation" in Is 43:1, or "thy self-creation" in Ezek 28:13,15 125,154 178J,the whole becomes "Asaf created"or Asaf self-created". Thus, we can trace the Tanais creed to the Canaan-Poenician solar cult with the horsman as "the savior and heathern god 57</page><page sequence="6">IRMA HAYNMAN of the Near East", L15,b9J and to such names as Yasup-ilu, a place-name in the Karnak list of Thotmes III (XVI BCE), Milki-asapa, a king of Gebal (KB 2. 149, 241), Baal-iasupu, an Arvadite prince (KB 2. 173) - VII BCE. Accordingly, the established etymological relation of safah- ,asaf-yasaf- can be translated into genetic kinship of such solar personages as Assyrian-Caucasian Asaph/Savaz, Biblical Joseph "abreh" (Gen. 41:43), Bosporan Aspourgos, Thracian Sabazius/Attis, and Central Asian Sijawush L43J (probably from one of the seven Greek forms of the name ). Each of deities evolved in different ethnical and historical milue, but retained common features.L22,759-774523,827-830JThe cult corresponds to practices referred to in connection with apostasy and solar rites related to horses or horse-mounting:2 Kgs 23:11 - "And he took away the horses, that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entrance of the house of the Lord, by the chamber of Nathan-melech, the eunuch, and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire"; Hos 14:4- "Asshur shall not save us; we will not mount upon horses; neither will we call the work of our hands our gods". The reconstruction of the before I CE creed can be based only on the name "Tanais", burial practices, and "negative" signs of resemblance to the local cults. General evidence of the continuity of traditions allows for at least partial interpolation of the after I CE cult to a previous period. Besides, Strabo 11.2-3,11 informs that king Polemon,who had destroyed Tanais, was killed by Aspurgians on their island. The event having occured in 8 BCE, we have an indication on the connections between Tanais and Aspurg before the time indicated by the inscriptions. The most probable conclusion seems to be a variant of the peripherial Judaism with some traces of the solar Kybele/Tanit-Pane-Baal Haman. The creed of Tanais was characterized with syncretism and prominent monotheistic features of the three-in-one god in edvance of early Christianity, though it evolved from the unorthodox Judaism. The reliefs must have served as icons, another feature of the hellenized Judaism, or of Christianity. The character of cellar shrines agrees with our theory. We suggest that the hellenized Jewish immigrants,called the "Hellenes" just like those, who embraced the Christianity, introduced Christian features into the cult having accepted an Arsacide Aspourgos as a messianic king Asaph/Joseph. The theological tradition of Israel,when -the Lord stands at the head of His chosen people, then the king chosen by the Lord rules over Israel has been translated into the structure of the guilds.Thus the first category coincides with the first phase,while the second category guilds headed by the priest 58</page><page sequence="7">THE SYNCRETIC CREED OF HELLENIZED JEWS FROM TANAIS correspond to the selection of a king, and the third to the people as king's brothers (cf. the "adoptation scene", when Joseph reconciles with his brothers in Gen 45:4,5). Thus, the tradition of the first dying messiah Ben Joseph could be rooted in the recognized solar connections of Joseph. Bibliography. 1. M. Avi-Yonah, Art in Ancient Palestine (Jerusalem, 1981). 2.
