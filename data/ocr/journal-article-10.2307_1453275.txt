They are: i) Mendelssohn's attitude to the rising secular Hebrew literature, 2) his philosophy of Judaism, and 3) his views on Jewish national ideals. Mendelssohn's direct contribution to Hebrew letters in general and to what came to be known as "modem Hebrew literature" in particular, was almost negligible cormipared with his contribution to German letters. 2 The smallness of his contribution stands out sharply when one realizes the great potentialities of his Hebrew style as exemplified by his early Koheleth Musar (I750), the commentary on the Miloth ha-Higgayon of Maimonides (I76I) and his Or li-Netivah (1783). With his simplicity, clarity and beauty of style, he undoubtedly could have influenced the content and form of modern Hebrew literature. 3 This, however, Mendelssohn never attempted to do. He knew Hebrew well enough to write in a clear and rich style on subjects concerning Judaism ;4 he was helpless, however, and his style was rigid and awkward when he tried to write on secular subjects. 5 Characteristic 2 An almost complete list of his Hebrew writings is to be found in Moses Mendelssohns Gesammelte Schriften, Jubileumsausgabe (Berlin, I929), vol. XIV, Hebrdische Schriften, bearbeitet von Haim Boro- dianski (Breslau, I938). Not listed are: (i) "She'elah u-Teshuvah b'-Devar ha-Inoculation", Ha-Meassef II (Tishri, I785), and (2) the letter-exchange with J. Z. Emden about the early burial of the dead, ibid., (Ab). 3 In August, I768, shortly after the appearance of Phaedon, Wessely wrote to Mendelssohn: 13"121-l n=nn *N 1'1 m lpI" fl2 1 f-lin X"5? nfl'71 tUMINj 1'2 Gesammelte Schriften (Jubileums- ausgabe), XVI, letter 99; see also S.

Mir</page><page sequence="3">MOSES MENDELSSOHN-BARZILAY 7I is the fact that when the Maskilim in I784 started the Meassef, the first Hebrew monthly, they turned to Wessely rather than to him for guidance. 6 Moreover, when asked.to contribute to this publication, he offered only the exchange of letters between him and Emden on the "burning" question of the day concerning the early burial of the dead, and an immature poem. 7 That in his youthful days Mendelssohn believed in the potential capacity of Hebrew to express modern ideas, is obvious from some passages of the short lived Koheleth Musar. 8 Even at a much later period he still harbored plans for writing books in Hebrew. 9 However, the urge was probably not strong enough and circumstances not conducive. But, whatever the reasons, the fact remains that Mendelssohn's direct share in the effort to revive and secularize the Hebrew language was almost nil. Furthermore, the little he did write in Hebrew, of which the Or li-Netivah was the most extensive and important, was so conservative in tone and ideas, that it could be attributed to the rabbinical literature of the Middle Ages. The slightest comparison between his German and Hebrew writings indicates the dual-language policy Mendelssohn selbst ist es noch allezeit Arbeit, so oft ich meine Gedanken in Schrift verwandeln will."

This policy was actually an overt expression of a deeper dualism, which characterized his life and philosophy, the dualism of wordly culture on one hand and of Judaism on the other hand, of a humanist universalism versus a conservative irrational particularism. He always relegated Hebrew to holy subject-matter and used it as a medium for ideas of an almost fossilized conservatism, which made no concession to the spirit of the age. His Hebrew writings never echoed the deep humanism and rationalism which permeated his German writings. Mendelssohn con- sciously used the two languages for different purposes between which seemingly he could find no connection. Such an attitude was not conducive at all to the revival of the Hebrew language for secular literary use. It was mainly by his exegetical work known as the Biu4r, that Mendelssohn's name was perpetuated as the father of Haskalah among the German and even more among the Eastern-European Jews. However, within the framework of his intellectual activity, the Biur was only of an incidental nature. At best he considered it only a temporary substitute for the inner interest of his life, the pursuit of philosophical speculation. 10 Had his frail health not deteriorated greatly 10 In a letter to Henning of June 29, I779, Mendelssohn wrote: "Nach dem ersten Plane meines Lebens .... war ich weit entfernt jemals ein Bibelherausgeber oder iibersetzer zu werden. Ich wollte mich blos darauf einschranken, des Tages seidene Zeuge verfertigen zu lassen und un Nebenstunden der Philosophie einige Liebkosungen abzugewinnen. Es hat aber der Versehung gefallen, mich einen ganz anderen Weg zu fiihren. Ich verlor die Fahigkeit zu meditiren und mit ihr angangs den gr6ssten Theil meiner Zufriedenheit. Nach einiger Untersuchung fand ich dass der iiberrest meiner Krafte noch hinreichen konne meinen Kindern und vielleicht einem anseh- lichen Theil meiner Nation einen guten Dienst zu erzeigen, wenn ich ihnen eine bessere iibersetzung und Erklarung der heiligen Biicher in die Hande gebe, als sie bisher gehabt hatten. Dieses ist der erste Schritt zur Kultur, von welcher meine Nation leider in einer solchen Entfernung gehalten wird, dass man an der Moglichkeit einer Ver- besserung beinahe verzweifeln mochte." M.

Furthermore, as far as the results of the Biur are concerned-whether he intended it to be a bridge to German culture, as Smolenskin and Schulman contended, 13 or through it desired to restore to the Holy Books their original meaning and clarity which had become distorted and perverted by Jewish and Christian commentators alike 14 -they were regarded almost unanim- ously as negative and damaging to the further survival and development of the Hebrew language and its culture among German Jews.

None of the conservative views he held or the religious practices he observed were strong enough to counteract the undermining influence inherent in the example of his life and the cultural pattern he followed. His was a life deeply immersed in and entirely devoted to the intellectual milieu of Western Europe and spiritually far removed from traditional Judaism. "Only bodily Mendelssohn remained Jewish, intellectually, however, he was a pagan." 16 The sources of his spiritual nourishment were those of the European Enlightenment. His Judaism, though deep and strong, belonged to the emotional stratum of his being, and had it not been for external pressure, he would never have made it subject to philosophical analysis. Even his statement to the contrary 17 fails to impress one who studies his life and works seriously. It was used only in the heat of a polemic and should not be taken at it s face value. He never spoke 15 Jost thought that Mendelssohn's translation disseminated know- ledge of the Bible, but it was far more conducive to the dissemination of German, J. M.

(3) The</page><page sequence="8">76 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW incidental nature of the Biur, 22 applies equally to his philo- sophy of Judaism. Within the frame of his philosophical pursuits, it was only incidental and formed no integral part of it. Had Mendelssohn been left to pursue his intellectual quest without becoming involved in the Lavater-Bonnet affair, and challenged to account for his remarks on Dohm's book (in his preface to Manasseh ben Israel's Rettung der Juden), he might never have undertaken his analysis of Judaism. This analysis was the result of external pressures and circumstances rather than inner promptings and growth. Neither by its genesis nor by the aims it intended to serve was Mendelssohn's philosophy of Judaism, Jewish. It did not result from a historical perception of the unique character of the new era that was dawning in Jewish life and demanding a new formulation of the old contents. Nor was it meant as a guide for the modern Jew. The two basic principles arrived at by Mendelssohn in his philosophy of Judaism, its freedom of thought and the eternal validity of its laws, contained an open challenge to the prevalent notion among Christians about the Christian character of the state rather than directi- ves for the Jews. The intellectual freedom, which he pointed out as implicit in Judaism, must not be interpreted as an appeal to the Jews to throw themselves into the arms of European culture, but rather as an attempt to show the Christian society that there was actually nothing in Judaism to prevent the Jews from participating actively in the world of thought and learning of modern Europe. The same is true of his view on the validity of the ceremonial law. He did not intend to admonish his coreligionists to remain loyal to their exchange of letters with Lavater-Bonnet and the "Erbprinz von Braunschweig-Wolfenbiittel," ibid., pp. 53-134.

It would seem that Mendelssohn's insistence on the obligation of the Jews to preserve the cere- monial law was treated too rigidly by his critics. 23 Had they considered it less in terms of an unqualified demand directed to Jews, but as a means for counteracting spreading Christian attempts to convert Jews, attempts which Mendelssohn perceived as the real objective behind the preaching of tolerance and brotherly love, 24 then their argumentation against Mendelssohn that he set the Jews free in the realm of thought only to enslave them in the sphere of action, would have lost its poignancy. Mendelssohn was less a devout Jew than an inveterate anti-Christian. 25 Less concerned with the future fate of Judaism, he dreaded a possible victory of Christianity and the prevalence of the idea of a Christian state. Such a victory, he was convinced, would only bring darkness and suffering. It would mean an end to freedom of thought and, ultimately, to the dignity of man. 26 Mendelssohn's philosophy of Judaism, then, was not a study 23 Cf. S.

In short, it was motivated by political reasons and aims. 27 B. The Essence of Judaism. Mendelssohn's answer to the basic question of the essence of Judaism is formulated both in negative and positive terms. Judaism, to start with the negative, as a revealed religion, is not a religion of articles of faith, doctrines and eternal truths. Abstract ideas about God, His rule and providence, and some general principles of a moral nature underlie the various laws; indeed, they are the soul of the law and its motivating force. They were not, however, imposed as doctrines by revelation. The people assembled at Mount Sinai did not hear the proclamation of a philosophy constituting the basis for social and individual happiness, but-and this is its positive formulation-the proclamation of a divine set of laws, regu- lations and directives for the establishment of a happy society. The difference between Jews and Christians, as far as the concept of revelation is concerned, may thus be defined as a difference between a revealed religion and a revealed law. God who descended on Sinai, did not appear as the God of the philosophers proclaiming in a miraculous way the doc- trine of His existence and His attributes. He revealed Himself solely as a law-giver who commanded His chosen people to follow a unique way of living, but imposed no uniformity of thought on them. The revealed Law was not directed to reason, but to the will, the source of human action. 28 Revelation, Mendelssohn believed, could not have taken place at Sinai, and even if it had, would have remained meaningless, had not a long period of intellectual and moral preparation preceded 27 Cf. S. Ascher, Leviathan, II, pp. I57-I6I. 28 Jerusalem in Moses Mendelssohn Gesammelte Schriften, III (Leipzig, I843), pp. 255-262, 3I2-322, 348-362. Letter to Wolf (Berlin, July II, I782), ibid., V (I844), pp. 602-603.</page><page sequence="11">MOSES MENDELSSOHN-BARZILAY 79 it. It was during that preparatory period that the people, through teaching and contemplation, were impregnated with the higher truths about God, man and the world. 29 The revelation was thus no divine imposition of new truths and doctrines, but of a new way of life, which intended to make the old truths live through actions, daily customs and habits. It was an imposition of means and ways for the implement- ation of the eternal truths. The only eternal truths Judaism received through revelation were, according to Mendelssohn, the historical. The body of these truths, however, is not made clear. On the one hand he seems to include the whole historical narrative contained in the Pentateuch; 30 on the other, he singles out only the Exodus and the principle of reward and punishment. 31 Though constituting an integral part of Judaism, these historical truths are phenomenologically of the lowest order. Their validity does not rest on reason but on the trustworth- iness of the testimony. It is primarily on this account and in order to vest them with more authority and strength that they were supported by signs and miracles. 32 Though philo- sophically of no great value, these truths are of great import- ance, as they constitute the basis of the national bond and unity. 33 Judaism may thus be summarized as composed of three strata: eternal truths, historical truths, and the main body of the ceremonial law. The eternal truths, to repeat, are only contained implicitly, and with reference to their essence the individual is granted full freedom of contemplation and speculation. Explicitly, revealed Judaism is thus reduced to the historical narrative and the ceremonial law. Two basic creeds of the European Enlightenment, rationalism and 29 Jerusalem, pp. 3I9-320. 30 Ibid., p. 349. 31 Ibid., pp. 3I9-320. 32 Ibid., pp. 3I3-3I5. 33 Ibid., p. 349; see also Mendelssohn, "An die Freunde Lessings," Gesammelte Schriften, III (I844), pp. I3.</page><page sequence="12">8o THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW humanism, seem to underlie this greatly reduced concept of revelation. It was because of his devotion to these ideals of the age, that Mendelssohn felt compelled to exclude from revealed religion those metaphysical and ethical truths which were considered then as the sine qua non for the existence of all civilized societies, and believed attainable by all humanity through the application of reason and contemplation. 34 It would be, Mendelssohn thought, contrary to the beneficial intentions of God in relation to humanity at large to have made what is most essential to its happiness the subject of a miraculous revelation to only one people. 35 The results of such a conception of Judaism are very significant and far reaching theoretically as well as practically. On the positive side, it should be pointed out, is the full intellectual freedom such a view grants to its holders. Even Spinoza, notwithstanding the great difference between his views and those held by traditional Jewry, could have, to the mind of Mendelssohn, remained in the fold of Jewry had he not violated the Law and waged an outright war against it. 36 The implicit negative results, however, far outweigh, at least from the point of view of the national thought, this gain. It is above all the reduced scope and shrunken meaning 34 Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, pp. 3I5-3I6, 348-349. 35 "Die Gliickseligkeit ist der Zweck unseres Daseins, und wenn Gottschlechterdings nur einem Volke die einzigen Mittel zu diesem Zwecke an Handen gegeben, was sollen wir von seiner Regierung denken ?" "Gegenbetrachtungen iiber Bonnets Palingenesie," Ge- sammelte Schriften (Jubileumsausgabe), VII, p. 76. 36 .... Ich wusste, dass es auch einen gelauterten Spinozismus gibt, der sich mit allem, was Religion und Sittenlehre Praktisches haben, gar wohl vertragt; .... wusste, dass sich dieser gelauterte Spinozismus hauptsachlich mit dem Judenthume sehr gut vereinigen lasst, und dass Spinoza, seiner speculativen Lehre ungeachtet, ein orthodoxer Jude hatte bleiben k6nnen, wenn er nicht in anderen Schriften das echte Judentum bestritten, und sich dadurch dem Gesetze entzogen hatte. Die Lehre des Spinoza kommt dem Juden- thume offenbar weit naher, als die orthodoxe Lehre der Christen." Mendelssohn, "An die Freunde Lessings," Gesammelte Schriften, III (I843), p. 5.</page><page sequence="13">MOSES MENDELSSOHN-BARZILAY 8I of revelation that leaves Judaism greatly impoverished. 37 Mendelssohn, the rationalist and humanitarian, accorded to reason and humanity that which every traditional Jew believed to have been his sole possession and the heritage directly bestowed upon him by God. Such a conclusion is forced upon us when confronted with the direct question: what did Mendelssohn leave as the core of Judaism after withdrawing its moral and philosophical teaching? The answer is clearly given by Mendelssohn himself. "Judaism, as a revealed religion," he wrote, "consists solely and exclusively of revealed laws of God's worship.' 28 Not without foundation Steinheim wrote of such a view: Two basic ideas were thus removed from revelation: the revelation of God Himself and of His will in an ethical sense. The only thing left was the inexplicable ceremonial law. The whole act of revelation with its supernatural setting and display thus seems to have been reduced to the trivial task of instructing one unique people in the ways and manners of a mere court service: how to attire them- selves, sacrifice, pray, etc., in short in all those customs and mannerisms prevailing at the court of an Asiatic despot. It is obvious that such a view greatly undermined the esteem and value of the Law and made its further preserv- ation most precarious. .. It was easy for the generation that followed Mendelssohn to perceive that the whole structure of the Law, allegedly erected for the worship of God, was after all only an empty edifice where the ruler does not nor ever did dwell. 39 The negative inference, however, goes even further. Not only is the scope of revelation reduced, but, as will be explain- ed, the motivation for the continued preservation of the Law is undermined. 37 Cf.

It was, however, not the only way, but one of many ways. Other nations, who had not experienced revelation, were not worse off. All were born to be happy and adequately equipped for the attainment of this aim. It would have been below the dignity of God, as the benevolent Father of the human race, to have revealed Himself only to Israel and vested it alone with the means for the attainment of happiness. The Israelite does not want to be the only one whom God has destined for happiness, but he is the only one who cannot attain it by any other way. Those upon whom God has not imposed this heavy load of commandments have only one obligation: to live in accordance with the laws of nature and they may rest assured that man as such is born to be happy. 40 Furthermore, not only is Israel's way to happiness, thrQugh the practice of the ceremonial law, not the only one, it is not even the absolutely best one. It was the best only "for certain times, circumstances and under certain conditions." 41 The differences between Christians and Jews thus shrink and are reduced to a mere difference of means and ways for the attainment of the same purpose. 42 One logical inference Mendelssohn seemed happy to draw from his clearly overemphasized humanitarian interpretation of Judaism was its lack of a missionary character. Judaism, he repeatedly emphasized, is not a missionary religion. He wrote to Graf von Limar: 40 "Gegenbetrachtungen fiber Bonnets Palingenesie," Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, VII (I929), pp. 75-76. 41 Cf. "Schreiben Mendelssohns wahrend seines Streites mit Lava- ter," Gesammelte Schriften, V (I844), pp. 503-504. 42 "In unseren Ohren," he writes to Bonnet, "wiirden diese Namen [of 'Jew' and 'Christian', I.B.] nichts Feindseligeres haben, als die Namen Cartesianer und Leibnizianer." "Moses Mendelsohn an D. Bonnet," February 9, I770, Gesammelte Schriften, III (I843), p. II4.</page><page sequence="15">MOSES MENDELSSOHN-BARZILAY 83 The duty to convert others is clearly an inference of the assumption, on the part of the missionary, that outside the Church to which he belongs there is no hope for salvation. But, since I as a Jew have no need for such an assumption, because. . . we believe that the righteous of all the faiths will gain Seligheit, the incentive for conversion withers away and I rather feel under obligation not to argue publicly against any religion which possesses some good moral qualities. 43 Again he wrote to Jacob Herman: "The noblest religion is one which is the most tolerant and which teaches us to embrace with our love the whole human race. There is nothing more painful and depressing than an exclusive religion." 44 The argument may further be strengthened by the con- sideration of another basic question in Mendelssohn's philo- sophy of Judaism, the purpose of the ceremonial law. Why were the Jews singled out as its trustees? In answer, Mendels- sohn, in his Jerusalem, tries in a somewhat strange and unhistorical manner, to find a relationship between the gradual development of language and the rise of idolatry. 45 The human mind, he tells us, first invented pictorial symbols for the description of abstract ideas. Our innate perversive inclinations, in the course of time, vested these symbols with reality. This marked the beginning of idol worshipping which lasted for thousands of years. The only exception were the forefathers of the Jewish people, who were the sole possessors of pure ideas of natural religion which they tried to teach to their children and imprint upon their hearts. It was the bondage of Egypt, however, that turned their minds away from the precepts of natural religion. 43 Gesammelte Schriften, V (i844), p. 503; cf. also "Schreiben an ....

Religious and moral congnitions were henceforth tied up with the daily activities of human beings . .. the great principle the Law seems to have followed is: as for action, people have to be prompted and urged; as for thought and contemplation, however, they have only to be encouraged and awakened. Therefore, each of the acts they were ordered to do, each custom and ceremony imposed, was pervaded with its own meaning and sublime intention, aiming to direct the mind towards the theoretical truths of religion and ethics. For the searcher of truth they were an incentive to thought and study. 46 In a more incisive manner Mendelssohn expressed the same view about the purpose of the ceremonial law some years earlier in his "Gegenbetyachtungen iiber Bonnets Palingenesie." There he wrote: The nations of the world were advised to keep the law of nature and the religion of the patriarchs . .. but most of them have drifted away from that simplicity of the first religion. To the detriment of truth, they embraced erroneous ideas and practices about God and His rule. Thus it seems that among other reasons unknown to us, the ceremonial law might have been imposed for the purpose of singling out visibly this people from among all the others. The many observances were meant as a constant reminder of those holy truths which none of us should have forgotten. 4 The ceremonial law has thus had one main object; to make the Jewish people, by imposing on them a unique way of life, a living symbol of natural religion, the religion of the patriarchs The results of Mendelssohn's inquiry, from the national point of view, are not impressive. Not only is the scope of 46 Ibid., pp. 340-34I. 47 Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, VII (Berlin, I930), pp. 97-98.</page><page sequence="17">MOSES MENDELSSOHN-BARZILAY 85 revelation greatly reduced, but by its subservience to natural religion, revelation is deprived of its supernatural meaning and goal. Justly Ritter remarked: It is more than surprising to think that while God had adequately equipped us to attain by reason the high principles upon which our moral and religious system is built, He failed to endow us with the capacity to arrive by this very reason at the proper ways and means of keeping them alive within us. . and thus made revelation necess- ary. 48 Mendelssohn's reason for the preservation of the ceremonial law in the present is essentially the same which he suggests for its original imposition. He wrote to Homberg: The ceremonial law is indispensable in the present as a bond of unity. And this unity must, in my opinion, last as long as polytheism, anthropomorphism and religious usur- pation prevail on this globe. As long as these tormentors of reason (Plagegeister) are united, the real theists must also find a way of uniting for the purpose of preventing the others from trampling everything under their feet. What can constitute such a bond? Doctrines and opinions? Then we shall have articles of faith, symbols, formulas, and the result will be a shackled and enslaved reason. Nothing can form a stronger bond than actions, actions pervaded with significance and meaning, i.e. ceremonies. 49 The only reason for the preservation of the ceremonial law thus stems from a negative source, namely the imperfect intellectual and moral state of society. Mendelssohn seems to have envisoned a world religion wholly based on the principles of pure reason, 50 although he well understood that the time 48 Ritter, op. cit., p. 62. 49 Letter to Herz Homberg of September 22, I783, Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, V (I844), p. 669. 50 Cf. the exchange of letters with the Erbprinz von Braunschweig- Wolfenbuittel, Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, III (I843), PP- I32-I33.</page><page sequence="18">86 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW for its realization was still far off. He saw Judaism as indis- pensable for preserving the purer form of religion. Jews must continue to exist as a separate community until the human race, one day, attains purer intellectual as well as moral ideas. In European society, predominantly Christian, he saw in the Jews real theists and purists. Regardless of the motivation for the preservation of the ceremonial law, one point emerges clearly: Mendelssohn puts it at the service of humanity striving to nobler principles of religion rather than at the service of the Jewish people alone. He makes its future existence dependent on factors which lie outside Judaism rather than on inner changes which may affect the Jews as a people. The Law becomes thus utterly detached from its national frame and setting. Mendelssohn was well aware of the Jewish belief that the ceremonial law was once the state law of the Jewish people, a kind of constitution of a people living in its own country as a separate nationality. 51 And though he emphasized that the law remained valid even after its political frame disinte- grated, and that its binding force would continue unless a new revelation took place, 52 he, nevertheless, gave no other reason for its further preservation than the negative mentioned above. He even expressed his belief in the advent of the Messiah. 5 He mnst also have been aware of the reason adduced by traditional Jewry in support of the validity of the Law in the Diaspora, namely, that it should be kept alive with the people for the sake of its immediate implementation when redemption came and the final return to Zion took place. In none of his writings, however, did he even mention or allude to this argument. By his reasoning he thus severed 51 Mendelssohn, Jerusalem, pp. 350-352. 52 Ibid., pp. 354-355. 53 ".... wir noch einen zukiinftigen Messias erwarten, der den Beruf haben wird, unsere Nation herzustellen, und von aller politi- schen Unterdriickung zu befreien." Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, III (i843), p. I7I.</page><page sequence="19">MOSES MENDELSSOHN-BARZILAY 87 the tie between the Law and the natural soil of its origin and its aspired future. He vested the Jews with a spiritual signi- ficance and purpose, assigned to them the mission of dis- seminating natural religion; however, he stripped them of national ideas and ideals. Unconsciously and unintentionally perhaps, Mendelssohn prepared the way for the idea of the mission of Judaism, which became dominant in the circles of reformed Jewry during the nineteenth century.54 C. Mendelssohn's Attitude to the Ceremonial Law. Mendelssohn bequeathed to Jewish posterity two basic ideas, which could be interpreted as guiding principles for the Jews in the modem world: Intellectual freedom and observ- 54 Though Mendelssohn's views, Steinheim argued, were rather destructive for traditional Judaism, they were a historical necessity to "purify" Judaism and bring forth its original beauty. Through his work Mendelssohn helped people to grasp the true mission of Judaism, which was to spread the word of God. Op. cit., pp. 9I ff. Were we, writes Ritter, to accept Mendelssohn's view that the existence of Judaism depended on the ceremonial law, the decline of that law would have meant the end of Judaism. "An diesem Unter- gang hatte dann der jiudische Philosoph der Aufklarung die haupt- sachliche Schuld .... Aber weil wir ein Judenthum anerkennen, dass so erst recht gedeiht und seine wahre weltgeschichtliche Aufgabe antritt, begriissen wir gern Mendelssohns religiose Thatigkeit als die anregendste und verdienstlichste der Neuzeit unter den Juden." Mendelssohn und Lessing (i886), p. 4I. Further indication of what may possibly be interpreted as the "Mission Idea," and a somewhat qualified stand on the ceremonial law, is also found in Mendelssohn's letter to Graf von Limar, in which he wrote "Es gibt .... einen innerlichen und ausserlichen Gottesdienst, welche wohl unter- schieden werden miissen. Der innerliche Gottesdienst der Juden hat keine andere Vorschriften, als die Vorschriften der natiirlichen Religion. Diese sind wir allerdings verbunden auszubreiten .... Hin- gegen ist unser ausserlicher Gottesdienst gar nicht bestimmt aus- gebreitet zu werden, weil, er Vorschriften enthalt die an Personen, Zeiten und Umstande gebunden sind. Wir glauben zwar, unsere Religion sei die beste, weil wir sie fur g6ttlich halten; aber daraus folgt nicht, dass sie schlechterdings die beste sei. Sie ist die beste fuer uns und unsere Nachkommen, die beste fur gewisse Zeiten und Umstande und unter gewissen Bedingungen." Mendelssohn, Ge- sammelte Schriften, V (I844), p. 503.</page><page sequence="20">88 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ance of the Law. As postulates these could be interpreted in terms of an appeal to Jews to assimilate in European culture, but simultaniously to preserve the way of life of traditional Judaism. It is interesting to note that most ot his critics, who found fault with his doctrine of the validity of the Law, extolled him for having paved the way for the Jews to European culture. The criticism of Mendelssohn's insistence on the full preservation of the Law came from two sides: first from the reformists and, at a later period, from the nationalists. While the former considered the demand to observe the Jewish way of life as the greatest obstacle to Jewish absorption in civil society, 55 the latter interpreted it as containing an implied identification of Judaism with religion, which, to them, meant a negation of Jewish nationhood. "Had he considered," Smolenskin argued, "the Jews a nation, he would not have harbored such ideas." 56 Mendelssohn's insistence on the Law as the sole means of unity among the Jews, was, to the mind of Smolenskin, the result of a conception which considered the Jews "a community bound by unique laws", but not a nation. Had Mendelssohn, Smolenskin implied, insisted less on the full validity of the Law and admitted its being subject to change and adaptation, he would have acted in the spirit of historical Judaism, which kept adjusting the Law to life in order to preserve the Jewish people. Such a view would have been a clear assertion of his belief in the people, for whose preservation the Law was intended. 55 S. Ascher, Leviathan, Bk. II, pp. 2I9-230; L.

They seem to have based their views about Mendelssohn's philosophy of Judaism exclusively on his Jerusalem, which was rather intended for the Christian reader. Had they taken into account his many other utterances on the subject, their accusation of his "having enslaved us to a meaningless law," would have lost much of its definite quality. Some of these utterances will be considered and an attempt made to formulate a more accurate statement of Mendelssohn's view on the ceremonial law. Best known is the phrase in his reply to Lavater, where he stated: "I cannot deny that I have noted in my religion many additions and distortions of human origin, which, unfortunately, dim its lustre ... in the essentials of my religion, however, I am unshakably convinced." 57 More revealing of his attitude to what he termed "popular religion," are some interesting passages from his correspondence with Sophie Becker, a deeply religious soul, perturbed by doubts and uncertainties. To her Mendelssohn wrote: Concerning the popular ceremonies of religion, it seems to me that the pleasant emotions they evoke in us, are gene- rally founded on some truths which underlie them. False additions, however, have dimmed somewhat this original truth. I adhere to the popular ceremonies of religion as long as my reason is not creative enough to invent a substitute for these pleasant emotions. I enjoy each custom which does not lead to intolerance or hate. Together with my children I enjoy each ceremony which has something good and truthful in it. As far as possible, I try to separate the false from the true and cast away nothing before I am able to replace its good influence with something better. 58 57 "Schreiben an den Herrn Diaconus Lavater zu Zurich," Mendels- sohn, Gesammelte Schriften, III (Leipzig, I843), pp. 4I-42. 58 Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, V (I844), p. 659.</page><page sequence="22">9O THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW This cautious, conservative, though not slavish, attitude to practical religion, is also encountered in many of his other letters. Thus, he writes to Homberg: "All our energy must be directed towards one goal, namely, to do away with the far reaching abuse of the ceremonies and restore to them their genuine and real meaning." 59 Mere difficulties or doubt must have no influence on our daily practices. As long as we have not attained full cer- tainty, we must, for all practical purposes, hold on to those principles on which we were brought up, and which were handed down to us by those whom we honor and respect. We should not venture upon the slightest change or innovation, before being certain that we walk on terra firma. 60 It is by no means a reformist spirit that pervades the above citations. They reflect a deeply conservative personality standing in awe and humility before a centuries-old tradition that found its embodiment in customs, habits and a unique way of life. On the other hand, they do not betray a slavish spirit ready to accept blindly the full scope of a tradition which in the course of centuries may have suffered some diminution of its original significance. To summarize, Mendelssohn's view on the ceremonial law, or what he termed popular religion, may best be defined as pragmatic. Each law, custom or ceremony he believed to contain some functional value conducive to happiness and moral living. 61 It must be treated with the greatest respect 59 Ibid., p. 669. 60 Ibid., p. 52I. 61 This pragmatic view was also characteristic of Mendelssohn's attitude to philosophy. "Die Philosophie," he writes to Sophie Becker, "soll mich gliicklicher machen, als ich ohne dieselbe sein wiirde; und dieser Bestimmung muss sie treu bleiben. So lange sie eine gute Gesellschafterin ist und mich auf eine angenehme Weise unterhalt, bleibe ich bei ihr; sobald sie vornehme, frostige, oder gar saure Gesichter macht, und uible Laune bekommt, lasse ich sie allein und spiele mit meinen Kindern." Mendelssohn, Gesammelte Schriften, V, pp. 647-658.</page><page sequence="23">MOSES MENDELSSOHN-BARZILAY 9I and kept unchanged until something at least as good, if not better, has been found. Haste and lightmindedness in such matters only serve to undermine moral and religious found- ations and upset spiritual equilibrium. If such a view be termed conservative, it must at least be qualified as a philosophical conservatism, based on the belief in the functional truth of religion rather than in its super- natural nature. If, again, one is inclined to term it reformist, he may be right only if he conceives of reform in terms of a desire to revitalize and restore the original meaning of cere- monies and customs, rather than to curtail them for the sake of expediency. It thus becomes clear that Mendelssohn's allegedly dogmatic approach to the Law and its preservation was not as rigid as generally supposed. 62 As pointed out, its public expression in Jerusalem must be viewed as a response to the growing Christian pressures upon the Jews, cloaked in the mantle of tolerance and love, to trade their religious adherence for civil emancipation. It was in reply to such pressures that Mendelssohn asserted that there was no room for trading the Law in exchange for the absorption in the civil society; that the Law was a divine imposition, and as such could be abrogated only by another divine revelation. Mendelssohn, it may finally be stated, was against any kind of reform motivated by utilitarian reasons. Had he lived longer, he surely would have been in favor of a gradual reform from within, prompted by the genuine desire to invigorate and revitalize Judaism. 63 In view of this, we believe that Fried- 62 Replying to Michaelis' criticism of Dohm, Mendelssohn pointed out that the Jewish Law would compromise with the duties of the state, which would be imposed on the Jews as a result of their eman- cipation. "Anmerkungen zu des Ritters Michaelis Beurtheilung des ersten Theils von Dohm, iiber die biirgerliche Verbesserung der Juden," Gesammelte Schriften, III (Leipzig, I843), p. 367. 63 Such an interpretation of Mendelssohn's view on the ceremonial law, may also help explain, to some extent at least, the contradictions between theory and practice one may observe in his life and attitude. While insisting on a strict observance of the Law, he seems to have</page><page sequence="24">92 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW been indifferent to its neglect by his close friends and members of his own family. Homberg's letter to Mendelssohn, in which he probably expressed his negative attitude to the ceremonial law, does not seem to have shocked him at all. He replied in a rather mild tone, and remained friendly to Homberg. Gesammelte Schriften, V, pp. 663-680. Homberg was by no means the only one, among Mendelssohn's close friends, who entertained such extreme views. The fact that the extreme Friedlander considered himself Mendelssohn's true disciple and the exponent of his ideas, should not be regarded as mere boasting or misinterpretation. In Mendelssohn und seine Schule, Steinheim wrote: "Das Send- schreiben Friendlanders m6chte vielleicht im Verstande Mendelssohns gewesen sein, in seinem Geiste war es keineswegs, und mit seinem Gewissen stand es in Wiederspruch. Mendelssohn verachtete die Apostasie aus Griinden der Ehre, und wenn er auch gerne seinem Freunde Lessing in jenes Land gefolgt ware, wo es weder Juden noch Christen giebt." Steinheim, op. cit., pp. 27-28. In this context, Mendelssohn's attitude to the education and proclivities of his favorite son Joseph may be mentioned. "Mein Joseph," he wrote with apparent equanimity to Homberg, "hat sein hebraisches Studium so gut als an den Nagel gehangt," Gesammelte Schrif ten, V, p. 673. and again: "Mein Sohn Joseph .... hat im Hebraischen fast alles vergessen .... Ich lasse ihn seinen eigenen Weg gehen." Ibid., p. 68o. Noteworthy is the fact that when Mendelssohn, a short time before his death, sent Joseph on a tour, he provided him with letters of in- troduction to Elise Reimarus and other Christian friends, but to no Jewish scholar. Ibid., pp. 72I-722. It would be futile to renew the argument about the much debated question whether Mendelssohn was sincere in the strict observance of the Law [this was the impression of Henriette Herz, cf. Ihr Leben und ihre Zeit, herausgegeben von Hans Landsberg (Weimar, I9I3), pp. I47-148], or adhered to it only in order to preserve his influence on Jewry [as was the opinion of Friedlander. Cf. An die Verehrer, Freunde und Schiiler Jerusalems (Leipzig, I8I3), p. I02; also Uber die Verbesserung der Israeliten im Kanigreiche Polen (Berlin, I8I9), p. 47, and idem. "Moses Mendelssohn von ihm und ueber ihm," in Jedidjah dritten Bandes, erstes Heft, pp. 29-30; Jost, Geschichte des Judenthums und seiner Sekten, p. 305 and others]. One thing is clear: in relation to his own children and close friends, Mendelssohn revealed more than a liberal attitude. He was concerned with safeguarding the well-being of his children, to save them from the humiliations and sufferings to which the Jews of the time were exposed. [M. Kayser- ling, Moses Mendelssohn, sein Leben und seine Werke (Leipzig, I862), Anhang, p. 45.] However, the problem of how to reconcile this aim with their Jewish integrity does not seem to have concerned him much.</page><page sequence="25">MOSES MENDELSSOHN-BARZILAY 93 laender's statement to the effect that Mendelssohn harbored in his heart plans for a gradual and cautions reform, should be treated more seriously and given more credence. 64 64 "Im vertraulichen Zirkel, wenn die Rede auf Reformen kam, rief er dem Feurigen, Raschen oft zu: nichts iibereilen! viel 6fters noch dem Besorglichen oder Aufgebenden: nicht verzweifeln!
