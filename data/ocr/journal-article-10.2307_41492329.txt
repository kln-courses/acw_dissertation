KOZLOWSKI ABSTRACT. - The article characterizes the PPN site Nemrik 9 in Northern Iraq. It is a vast site with several layers of settlement. The settlement begins at the end of the 9th millennium ВС, and it ends in the middle of the 7th millennium ВС. Round houses were replaced by rectangular ones during the last phase of building. A graveyard and a midden were also discovered, and the full extent of the stone pavement was reconstructed. All this makes it possible to reconstruct nearly a complete plan of the early Neolithic village, at least during its two latest phases. RÉSUMÉ. - Le site néolithique acéramique de Nemrik 9, en Iraq du Nord, remonte à la fin du 9e millénaire avant J.C. L' occupation se termine au 7e millénaire avant J.C. Aux maisons rondes succèdent dans la dernière phase des structures rectangulaires. Un cimetière, une fosse à détritus, un pavement de galets dégagé sur une grande surface ont été également mis à jour. Toutes ces structures permettent d'obtenir une vue presque complète des plans du village lors des deux phases les plus récentes. INTRODUCTION In the years 1985-1987 an archaeological mis- sion of the Warsaw University, headed by the author of this report, carried out excavations at a PPN site, Nemrik 9, a locality in the Dohuk governorate of northern Iraq. The still uncompleted studies were carried out as part of the international Saddam's Dam Salvage Project in close cooperation with the State Organization of Antiquities and Heritage, headed by Dr Moayed Said Damerji. The site, about 1,8 ha in area, lies on the third terrace of the Tigris, about 1 500 m from the bed of this river, and about 4 300 m from the foot of the Kurdish Mountains, at an altitude of about 340- 345 m above sea level, that is about 65-70 m above the present-day river valley. The strongly flattened third terrace is cut by numerous N-S running wadi valleys which divide it into a number of peninsulas. The site Nemrik 9 lies on one such peninsula, being bounded in the east and west by- two deep (up to 30 m) wadis (fig. 1). FIG. 1. - Nemrik 9. Geomorphological position. STRATIGRAPHY Site Nemrik 9 is a multilayer Neolithic tell, with maximum layer thickness of about two meters. The evidence uncovered in sondages and in the main ex- cavation unit justifies a stratigraphie division of the tell into three main settlement phases : the older, the middle, and the younger. Each of these phases is re- presented by a layer featuring a typical stratigraphie sequence consisting of (from the bottom upwards) remains of clay architecture, an ashey or blackish cultural layer, and, finally, a layer of river pebbles, most probably a remnant of stone pavement. All the layers feature well-preserved clay archi- tecture. Each of the distinguished layers appears to be the result of prolonged settlement during which FIG. 2. - Nemrik 9. House No 1. 25 Colloque Préhistoire Levant II Maison de Г Orient-Lyon 30 mai-4 juin 1988 Editions du CNRS , Paris, 1989</page><page sequence="2">various elements of the urbanistic structure were mo- dified, transformed and reconstructed, as for example in the case of House 1A which was rebuilt following a fire, or in the case of the constant repair of the surface of the "yard" in the northern part of the site by the addition of new stone layers. In between the various phases of long-term set- tlement there were instances of settlement destruc- tion, with possible breaks in its existence. URBANISTIC STRUCTURE The main excavations in the northern part of the site together with the small sondages and long shal- low sondage trenches make it possible, already at this stage, to reconstruct the urbanistic layout of the youngest phase of the settlement in the site's north- ern part. 1. The original surface relief of the "peninsula" with an NE-SW-running ridge caused that from its very beginning the main Neolithic settlement concentrated on the peninsula's leeward side, on its eastern slope. In other words, the ridge bounded the settlement in the west and north-west, with the east- ern border running along the eastern edge of the pe- ninsula. 2. Builders of the middle and late phases at- tempted to level the peninsula slope incline by buil- ding artificial terraces which acted as the successive use levels of the settlement. The terrace of the mid- dle phase is covered by a clay floor featuring small pebbles, while the late-phase terrace is covered by a stone pavement, frequently repaired, up to one me- ter thick in places. The almost level surface of this pavement dips in the eastern and southern parts, for- ming a step limiting the extent of this "court-yard" (fig. 3). FIG. 3. - Nemrik 9. Stone pavement. 3. Surrounding this "yard" are at least three ha- bitation structures (two circular (cf. fig. 2) and one rectangular), partly dug into the ground, and contem- poraneous with the "yard". On the surface of the "yard" itself there occur, in situ , querns and mortars, pits and hearths, a stone workshop, stone grinders, flint tools and waste, as well as snail shells and ho- rizontally lying animal bones; also found were iso- lated human graves. The overall impression is that of an ordered ur- banistic layout hinging on the centrally positional pa- ved "yard" surrounded by houses. It appears that this "yard" was a common property of the inhabitants of the settlement, serving numerous economic func- tions. 4. To the south of this "yard", near a natural fos- sil step dividing the site into the northern and the southern parts, there is a very large refuse pit filled with animal bones. It is, in a way, a connector joi- ning the northern and the southern parts of the site, being the central point of the settlement. 5. Further south, beyond the just mentioned re- fuse pit, begins another paved "yard", the southern one. Its extent has been determined sketchily, and it too was flanked by habitation structures. 6. Finally, at the southern end of the southern "yard" is a cemetery connected with the youngest phase of the settlement. 7. The general picture is one of a large settle- ment, highly organized urbanistically, hinging on two paved "yards" with rows of habitation structures (as a rule dug into the ground) around or along the "yard's" outer perimeters. Judging by the artifacts collected on the paved surface, the "yards" were communal places where diverse economic activities were performed. Another central element is the re- fuse pit, shared (?) by the entire settlement. The last important element of the spatial organization of the village is, obviously, the common cemetery set aside from the settlement. Further studies ought to give a better idea about the layout of the settlement's southern part and east- ern peripheries. ARCHITECTURE (fig. 2) Several architectonic structures were discovered in all of the principal settlement layers of the site. Buildings of circular or oval plan predominate, of course, but the youngest layer yielded also two buil- dings of irregularly rectangular outline. The oldest phase in the northern part of the site (House IB) is characterized by circular structures, ca 5-6 m in diameter, partly dug into the ground, with no walls surviving, as well as by circular "tauf" tombs, up to 4 m in diameter. 26</page><page sequence="3">The middle phase in the northern part of the site (House 1A) is marked by circular houses of greater diameter (ca 6-8 m), dug into the ground, with walls made of cigar-shaped bricks (ca 50 m long) and plastered with clay. The features inside the house in- clude four post sockets reinforced with clay and stones, well-developed benches along the walls, and pits, usually covered with flat stones; also worth mentioning is an elevated small bench and a "chair" fashioned with cigar-shaped bricks. All these furni- shings are covered with clay plaster. Graves were found beneath the floor. The youngest settlement phase (e.g. House 1) is characterized by a repetition of the shape and dimen- sions of earlier structures, the difference being that the previously wooden posts supporting the roof are replaced by massive pillars built with the "pisé" te- chnique (fig. 2). The walls continue to be made of cigar-shaped bricks (but smaller), and they are again covered by clay plaster, as are similarly the benches and the pillars. In this phase, the first subrectangular houses (e.g. House 2) with "pisé" walls make their appearance alongside the circular structures. Finally, mention must be made of circular houses with "tauf" walls, discovered mainly in the site's sou- thern part. These structures, usually ca 5-6 m in dia- meter, are no doubt older than the youngest phase, this being indicated not only by stratigraphy but also by the (still few) radiocarbon dates (ca 7 500 be for House 3). House 2A (lying beneath House 2) in the northern part of the site is similar to these houses. It was dated to 8 000-7 200 be. Both the "tauf" houses (e.g. 9) and House 2A feature structural elements similar to those described above, i.e. benches and post sockets, and they also have clay plaster. There were skeletal graves beneath the floors of some of them. GRAVES Nemrik 9 yielded a number of inhumations, mainly in the upper layer. The graves contained ei- ther complete skeletons, or just skulls or fragments thereof. The inhumations were variously localized. Some were incorporated in the stone pavement struc- ture (isolated skeletal graves, burial of a lower jaw accompanied by an antelope antler), other occurred in the fill of collapsed houses (burial of a skull ac- companied by grave goods in House 2), and still others were connected with the use level of houses (e.g. in House 1A). Separate mention is due to the skeletal cemetery at the southern edge of the settlement, containing a number of graves with variously oriented skeletons arranged in the embryonal position. The cemetery is most probably connected with the final period of the youngest phase of the site. The skeletons lay in oval pits; sometimes lined with clay. The only grave goods, if any, were infrequent flint arrow-heads, which indicate that some of the buried people died a violent death. So far no traces of plaster were found on the discovered skulls. The presence of a cemetery set aside from the settlement is indicative of a high degree of organization of the community inhabiting Nemrik in the last stage of its existence. FLINT INDUSTRY We describe it in the separate article published in the same volume. GROUND STONE INDUSTRY (figs 4,5) The ground stone artifacts are very numerous and highly diversified morphologically. Among them are querns, quern grinders, mortars and mortar grin- ders, pestles, grinding and polishing stones, stone balls (bolas), plaques, "maceheads", pointed objects, polished axes (including miniature specimens); there FIG. 4. - Nemrik 9. Ground stone industry. 27</page><page sequence="4">FIG. 5. - Nemrik 9. Ground stone industry. were also discovered very rare stone vessels, one of which was made of marble. The production of all types of artifacts was based on local raw materials, and the industry conforms excellently to other stone industries of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic in the region as a whole. MISCELLANEA (figs. 6,7) This category of finds includes stone pendants of various shapes, malachite beads, variously shaped "interesting" objects of cave dripstone, stone repre- sentations of sexual organs, river-shell ornaments, bone projectile points, bone awls, bone polishers, bone daggers, and also clay "plaques", "bands", and "nails".

Stone sculpture. 29</page><page sequence="6">ART (figs. 8,9) Separate mention is due to the art objects unco- vered in Nemrik. These are either clay or stone. The clay art objects comprise mainly Suidae heads, with some fragments of other animal representation (e.g. of a sheep) and one anthropomorphic figure. The se- cond group consists of sixteen excellent stone sculp- tures representing bird heads, Felidae and human beings. The sculptures represent various phases of their making, from the initial up to the final stage of completion. The figures are a sign of an original local cult, and the subject matter is similar to that in evidence in Mureybet in Syria, and in Cafer Híiyíik in Turkey. FAUNA The very copious faunal material (animal bones and snail shells) was recovered mainly from the up- per layer where it concentrated chiefly in the top part of the stone pavement (KM), lying in situ, and from the refuse pit (PT); in the latter place the material was particularly plentiful. Relatively scant material occurred in the fills of collapsed houses (Nos 1, 2 and 4). The analysis of animal bones, yet to be comple- ted, is being performed by Dr A. Lasota-Moskalews- ka; the following results are available so far. The foremost group of finds comprises relatively few bones of four species of domestic animals (sheep, goat, pig and cow), numerous bones of se- veral antelope species representing the fauna of rich grassy steppe, once occurring around the site; other steppe species include jackal and horse. The mixed forest environment is represented, among others by red deer, bos, wild boar, roe deer, beaver and badger. The second group of fauna is represented by a moderate amount of tubular bird bones. The third group of faunal remains consists of a small number of crayfish claws. The fourth groups are shells of snails consumed by inhabitants of Nemrik. According to professor A. Riedel, there are numerous shells of the land spe- cies Helix salomonica , accompanied by shells of the river clam Unio tigridis. The Helix salomonica shells from Nemrik are on average larger than those of mo- dern specimens of the species occurring in the Mid- dle East. This difference may be due to a more humid climate during Nemrik's occupation. Also mentioned must be the presence around the site of Indian buffalo and panther, among others. The general impression is that Nemrik was in- tentionally sited at a juncture of two rich biotopes, namely mixed forest and grassy steppe, a point of- fering particularly advantageous subsistence condi- tions, despite the fact that the settlement turned firm- ly away from the great river. FLORA The preliminary analysis of plant macro-remains obtained by flotation (performed by Mr Mark Nes- bitt, pers. comm.) indicates that legumes grains (vetch, lentil, pea) predominate in Nemrik, with only a trace presence of cereals. So far, there is no data about the possible domestication of these plants. С и CHRONOLOGY At present we have about 30 radiocarbon dates, mostly from the northern part of the site (Dr M. F Pazdur, Gliwice Си Laboratory, pers. comm.). These dates provide a good idea about the site's chronology, from its beginning to the end of Neolithic settlement (fig. 10). FIG. 10. Ci4 dates from Nemrik. The majority of dates were obtained from char- coals, and a few from shells of the land snail Helix salomonica. The dates are well correlated with the determi- ned stratigraphy of the site, and they indicate that the site's chronology (at least in its northern part) ought to be confined to the period 10 150-8 500 (8000) years BP, and that the various phases should be dated as follows : - the oldest phase - end of the 11th millennium BP; - the middle phase - the 10th millennium BP; - the youngest phase - end of the 10th millen- nium BP to the middle or end of the 9th millennium BP. More radiocarbon samples have been delivered to the Gliwice Си Laboratory. 30</page><page sequence="7">CONCLUSIONS The results so far indicate that the site Nemrik 9 in northern Iraq is among the sites of key importance for the study of Pre-Pottery Neolithic of the Near East. This extensive and well-preserved archaeologi- cal site raises hopes for the reconstruction of the complete urbanistic structure of a village from, as it seems, phase A of the Pre-Pottery Neolithic. The ve- ry numerous portable finds (flint and stone objects, animal bones) make possible a clear outline of the Early Holocene material culture and economy in the 8th/7th millennium be at a junction of two cultural provinces : the Levantine-Anatolian and the Zagros- Iranian. Further studies of this important site, sponsored by the Polish Scientific Programme RP-III-35 are planned. Stefan Karol KOZLOWSKI Warsaw University Warsaw , Poland 31</page></plain_text>
