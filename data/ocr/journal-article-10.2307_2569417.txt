<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Greening of the Squares of London: Transformation of Urban Landscapes and Ideals Henry W. Lawrence Department of Geosciences, Edinboro University of Pennsylvania, Edinboro, PA 16444 Abstract. The residential squares of London developed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries into a unique urban landscape form that introduced rural landscape values into the urban fabric in ways that continue to shape urban landscape ideals today. This study takes the viewpoint of cultural geogra- phy to look at the gardens in the squares as symbolic statements expressing social values in a critical period in the history of European cities, as property and social relations were in transition from late feudal to early capitalist modes. The open spaces of the squares were changed from open plazas in the seventeenth century to enclosed private parks at the end of the eighteenth century, based on the social values of the aristocracy, later adopted by the middle classes. Public rights of access were extinguished and the gardens were planted with trees and shrubs reminiscent of rural landscape parks. The squares and their sur- rounding residential districts represented some of the first expressions of the desire for class segregation, domestic isolation, and pri- vatized open space that later were to form the basis of suburban living. They also were a major arena for playing out the tension be- tween classes over access to open space and they influenced the development of early public parks. The residential squares and their gardens inspired imitation beyond London, including in the U.S. during the first third of the nineteenth century. Key Words: landscape ideals, urban morphology, cultural and historical geography, eighteenth cen- tury, Britain. N February 1991 the residents around Gramercy Park in New York City were embroiled in a struggle over assessments for the repair of the sidewalk around the park. As reported in the New York Times, "charges of election fraud, slander, threats and-worst of all-a breach of good manners and fair play, have caused a group of residents to rise up against the Gramercy Park trustees-a self-se- lecting group that clings jealously to its sover- eignty over keys to the park and the planting of flowers and shrubs" (Stanley 1991). The tempest in this quaint teapot revolved around the fact that Gramercy Park is, and has been since 1831, a private park, jointly owned and maintained by its surrounding residents. While other New Yorkers may walk by and enjoy the sight of the park, only the residents have keys to the gates in the fence that surrounds it. The private control of this oasis of greenery in the hard urban landscape of Manhattan is an anachronism today, and its legal arrangements are little more than a curious footnote in the history of the city. But it represents an urban landscape form that was important for almost two hundred years, one that developed first in the British Isles but has since played a major role in the development of modern urban landscapes both in Britain and elsewhere. The residential square and its garden formed the central elements in the residential land- scape of elite districts of London from the late seventeenth to the mid-nineteenth century. In the eighteenth century, they played a pivotal role in introducing trees and gardens into the urban landscape and in shaping subsequent environmental ideals of urban life. In the trans- formations of the residential squares of Lon- don, the nearly two centuries can be seen as an important chapter in the development of urban form and of urban landscapes as expres- sions of social values. The squares reflected and responded to changes in ideas about the use and control of land, about nature and its Annals of the Association of American Geographers, 83(1), 1993, pp. 90-118 ?D Copyright 1993 by Association of American Geographers Published by Blackwell Publishers, 238 Main Street, Cambridge, MA 02142, and 108 Cowley Road, Oxford, OX4 IJF, UK.</page><page sequence="2">The Squares of London 91 role in urban life, and about the shape and form of the city. To understand the residential squares, it is necessary to consider aesthetics, both archi- tectural and landscape, and the continuing struggle between private and public control over the access to and use of landscapes. The ways the gardens in the squares were created and used reveal these changes most clearly. Both as amenities and as expressions of taste, they reflect the social situation from which they arose. From paved plazas in the 1630s based on European models, the squares developed into shady green parks in the 1780s, trans- formed not only in appearance but also in function, from public plazas to private parks. It is the role of the lawns and gardens themselves that provides the key to understanding this landscape form. As F.M.L. Th6mpson said about the rise of suburbia (1982, 15), "it would be sensible to look to the suburban garden for the roots of the demand for suburban living," so it is sensible to look to the garden in the Georgian squares of London for the roots of another way of urban living that preceded sub- urbia and continues to influence urban land- scapes throughout the world. Nature in the City: Four Traditions A city, as a built place, is often seen as the antithesis of nature, since buildings and pave- ments displace forests and fields. Yet in most cities, the artificial human landscape includes elements of living nature selectively woven into its hard fabric. In Europe since the time of the Renaissance, these elements have usually been derived from the forms used in aristo- cratic parks and gardens, incorporated as ech- oes of an amenity landscape preferred to that of the city itself. In most of western Europe, these have derived from the garden allee, used as lines of trees within the city in malls, ave- nues, and boulevards (Lawrence 1988). Their use developed first in French cities in the sev- enteenth and eighteenth centuries and gained widespread popularity and imitation with the renovations of Paris under Napoleon III in the mid-nineteenth century. In the British Isles, however, different tradi- tions developed for incorporating natural ele- ments into the urban landscape, based on Eng- lish landscape tastes and social structures (Lowenthal and Prince 1965). The three most representative were the large city park, the residential square, and the house-and-garden of suburbia. The first derived from the royal parks near London that were surrounded by the growth of the city. These later inspired the creation of wholly new parks, thus beginning an urban tradition that is perhaps best repre- sented in this country by the work of Frederick Law Olmsted (Chadwick 1966; Schuyler 1986). The third has gone on to become the domi- nant urban form of the twentieth century, not just in Britain but in most of the industrialized world, shaping the growth of urban areas, drawing infrastructure and resources to its needs, and providing the most common places for the incorporation of natural elements into the urban landscape (Thompson 1982; Fish- man 1987). The second of the three British forms is the subject of this paper. The contribution of the residential square to modern urban landscapes was more complex than either the large park or the suburban house, and its legacy is less distinct today. Yet for two centuries, roughly from 1650-1850, the residential square was the most important way that the urban land- scapes of England incorporated natural influ- ence. It had a strong influence on the form of urban squares in cities outside England: Edin- burgh, Dublin, Munich, Paris, New York, and Boston, to name a few. It also influenced the design of nonresidential public plazas in the nineteenth century. It influenced the develop- ment of the large city park as an urban land- scape form in the early nineteenth century, both in its aesthetics and in its social functions. And it had a major influence on the early de- velopment of both the value system underlying the suburban way of life and the physical form of suburbia. Symbolic Landscapes and Social Values Scholars have studied the British residential squares from a variety of points of view, par- ticularly in London: as part of the general his- tory of the development of the city (Rude 1971), its social history (Chancellor 1907), its</page><page sequence="3">92 Lawrence architectural history (Summerson 1978), and, more recently, as the history of the building process (Olsen 1982; Chalklin and Havinder 1974; Cruickshank and Burton 1990). Yet they have paid little attention to the open spaces of the squares, to the forms of their gardens, or to the role they played in creating a distinctive urban landscape. The mature expression of the square gardens has been described by archi- tectural and urban historians (Rasmussen 1982; Giedion 1967, 716-39), and their modern rem- nants are well known. Yet the squares laid out in the early eighteenth century were distinctly different from those of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries in their composi- tion, use, and function in the overall landscape of the city. These changes have been the sub- ject of only fragmentary accounts with little dis- cussion of the role they played in expressing social values as they formed urban landscapes. This study approaches the subject from the perspective of cultural geography by looking at physical and social landscapes as expressions of cultural processes. It is partly a study in trans- formations of urban morphology, seeking to explain the relationship between social proc- esses and landscape patterns at a critical period in the history of the Western city. The particular object of study is the use of ornamental vege- tation in the residential squares of London and how they contributed to changes in the pat- terns of urban form. I also consider the rela- tionship between city and country and the role of nature in the human environment. The gar- dens when planted represented a concept of landscape that has become anachronistic but which had a powerful influence in its time and which has left us a legacy in the ways we view urban landscapes today. Central to an under- standing of the gardens in the squares are the roles of aesthetics in urban design and of social values placed on amenities in the urban land- scape. Since the residential squares of London were home to the elite classes of the nation, the role of the elite is also central. At one level, the squares can be seen as urban amenity land- scapes reflecting changes in elite tastes in gar- den design, but more fundamentally they reflected changing concepts of landscape as an expression of social relationships. The transfor- mation of economic relations from feudal to capitalist had a major impact on the landscape, which is apparent in the transformations of the squares. These squares were not isolated ele- ments in London's fabric; they were center- pieces of larger developments on aristocratic urban-fringe estates meant initially to house ru- ral aristocrats when in residence in the capital. The gardens in the squares must be seen in the context of the estate development process, both urban and rural, which was itself under- going a transition from feudal to capitalist val- ues for the land. As Cosgrove points out, the period of capitalist transition in Europe is pre- cisely one in which the status of land was uncer- tain.... For a long period land was the arena for social struggle: it was both status and property. To the extent that wealthy bourgeois aimed in the sixteenth to nineteenth centuries to gain social prestige in social formations still powerfully influenced by feudal relations and values, they aped the manners and tastes of the still significant landed nobility. . . Increasingly land was seen through new eyes: as a form of capital, as property, and both classes bent themselves to extinguish remaining feudal and collective rights on the part of the peasantry (1984, 63). Continental Influences and British Traditions The form of the urban squares in Britain de- rived initially from continental models, espe- cially the piazzi of Italy and the places of France in the late sixteenth and early seventeenth cen- turies (Lavedan 1941; Zucker 1959). There were distinct regional cultural differences in the role of squares in the form and public life of towns in Europe in the Middle Ages (Claval 1984). In England squares were relatively un- important except as marketplaces until Renais- sance influences were felt in the late sixteenth century. The first London residential square was Covent Garden, begun in 1630 with de- signs by Inigo Jones on land owned by the Earl of Bedford (Summerson 1978, 29-32). On the south side was the back wall of the garden of Bedford House, the home of the estate land- lord, and on the west was the new parish church of St. Paul. Leasehold houses were built on the north and east sides in Italian architec- tural style, but the whole composition of the arcaded buildings around the square imitated the form used in the Place Royale (now Place des Vosges) built in Paris twenty-five years ear- lier. The space at the center was paved with stone and completely open, which allowed public use that was to grow in importance over the years (Fig. 1).</page><page sequence="4">c,~~~~. - 7"t' '10 - %j of # te~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I fr ac (oviN T G~ R~ \I -~~~~ at - = - l To~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~p Figure 1.

It was, like the Place Royale, meant to be a residential square first and a public open space second. From the beginning we can see the tension between private and public use of squares that was to be a central concern later. The Duke of Bedford had not anticipated that the square would become a favorite place for market vendors, cab men, pickpockets, pros- titutes, and others who sought to make money off the presence of the wealth residing around the square. By failing to provide a separate mar- ket square, he had condemned the residential square itself to a public commercial role that would ultimately be its undoing as an elite resi- dential quarter. Another square emerged at the same period in an irregular fashion around the fields adja- cent to Lincoln's Inn, one of the City's Inns of Court. Lincoln's Inn Fields lay just west of the City and had been open to common use for many years (Survey of London 1912, 3-12). By the 1630s, a group of investors had bought up property surrounding the three sides of the fields away from Lincoln's Inn and begun to build houses. The residents of the Inn de- fended their access to the fields, and the de- velopers agreed that buildings would only sur- round it and that residents would continue to have access to it. When completed by 1659, it was in effect a sort of residential square, but the field was left in an unimproved condition and retained its former rural character for many years. Three other squares were established in the five years just before the Great Fire of 1666 that destroyed most of central London. The first to bear the name "square" was Bloomsbury (origi- nally Southampton) Square, created in 1661 on land owned by the Earl of Southampton at the northwestern edge of the built-up area of Lon- don (Summerson 1978, 39-41). It had at its center an open area paved with gravel, sur- rounded on three sides by the houses built for the wealthy leasehold tenants of the Southampton Estate and on the fourth by the home of the Earl of Southampton. Construction on St. James's Square began a few years later in the royal precinct of Westminster, just north of Pall Mall and St. James's Palace. Intended to house the highest nobility in the land, its urban mansions surrounded an open area, surfaced with gravel but not otherwise improved for human use (Dasent 1895, 49). Each of these developments included a separate market square located on the side streets away from the main residential square. A similar project was begun in the 1660s surrounding the field in front of Leicester House, home of the Earl of Leicester, between London and Westminster. It had been part of a larger field used as com- mon land by surrounding residents, but by planting "walks" of elm trees in the fields, Leicester effectively made the place into a gar- den; the ensuing Leicester Fields, later called Leicester Square, became the first London square to have trees at its center (Survey of London 1966, 424-33). That the rural Lincoln's Inn Fields, the park- like Leicester Square, the graveled Bloomsbury and St. James's Squares, and the paved Covent Garden could all exist simultaneously within one mile of each other to the west of London in the years just before the Fire points up the wide range of taste and architectural style in- spiring them. Despite increased uniformity af- ter the middle of the seventeenth century in urban architectural designs based on Italian and Dutch models, there was very little consensus on the most appropriate way to use or adorn the open spaces at the center of the squares. Although most of the earliest residential squares followed the continental models in keeping the space at the center completely open, later squares were usually laid out with gardens. Before the end of the seventeenth century came Soho (originally King's) Square, Golden Square, Red Lion Square, Charter- house Square, and the New Square at Lincoln's Inn (Report of the Royal Commission on Lon- don Squares 1928, 11). These all had some form of garden in the open space, from simple turf to tree-lined walks. They were unprece- dented in Europe, and their antecedents were not to be found in the design traditions of the continent but in two other British landscape forms. The more important was the traditional right of commons, which allowed some non- landowners to use certain private lands. Near London the most important were the Moorfields, just north of the city walls, where generations of Londoners had access to land for recreation, drying and bleaching of cloth, and the practice of archery (and later of fire- arms). The common right gradually became a public right (Levy 1990), and in 1606, the City undertook to plant tree-lined walks in the</page><page sequence="6">The Squares of London 95 Moorfields at the same time that suburban ex- pansion had begun to encroach on surround- ing lands (Brett-James 1935, 452-60). The re- sult was in effect a city park, a genuinely public ornamental open space. Other open spaces near town that were used in common, though still privately owned, and later turned into resi- dential squares included Leicester Fields, Red Lion Fields, and Lincoln's Inn Fields. The other antecedent to the residential green square was the form of the medieval garden, enclosed in a cloister or college quad- rangle (Stott 1990). The seizure of Church lands by Henry Vill and the transfer of them to his favorites converted many religious houses on the urban fringe into private estates or into leasable residential property as urban growth came to them. In fact, Covent Garden derived from a former convent garden on the same site. The college quadrangle tradition gave rise to residential squares within the city's inns of court, its law schools. Gray's Inn, Lincoln's Inn, and the Temple all had large garden squares within them that were open to the public in varying degrees and were surrounded by resi- dential quarters of the members of the inns (Fig. 2). The use of common lands and quadrangles as places for promenades developed in Britain in the late seventeenth century apparently in response to fashionable trends coming from Italy and France. They were even built in many provincial towns and in almost all resort towns, where they played important social roles as gathering spots for the local gentry (Borsay 1989, 162-72). The design or redesign of the parks and gardens generally followed conti- nental baroque forms, the most important ele- ment being a tree-lined walk. But the surface of the ground was almost always some form of grass or turf, sometimes even maintained by small flocks of sheep. The use of turf as an ornamental garden surface was not strictly a British form, since it was also to be found else- where in northern Europe. It was recom- mended as early as 1260 by Albertus Magnus (Thacker 1979, 84), but its use in carefully kept urban open spaces was almost unique to Brit- ain. Prestige Value The conjunction of these British medieval garden traditions with the imported continental forms of the public plaza lay behind the par- ticular form of the London residential square. But the form also owed much to the peculiarly British systems of property ownership and of social prestige. After the Fire, in the latter dec- ades of the seventeenth century, as the urban area spread slowly to the east and more rapidly to the west and north of the City of London, the residential square became one of the major forms used to establish new districts for the wealthier classes. From the beginning, the squares were intended to be amenities that increased the value of the property surround- ing them, in speculative construction projects aimed at providing housing for the growing upper-class population of London. A residential square was the centerpiece of a larger development that sometimes included a separate market square, shops, a parish church, and housing for servants, artisans, and other lesser folk in addition to housing for the major tenants on the square. The land in most cases belonged to a large landowner who leased it to speculators or directly to the ten- ants, usually on very long leases, up to 99 years, rather than selling it to them outright (Cruickshank and Burton 1990, 99-133). Often the landowners (or more rarely, the develop- ers) had control over the design of the build- ings surrounding the square and most strove for some sort of unified facades, though many fell short of their goal due to vagaries in the pace of construction and the will of contractors and tenants. Most had restrictive covenants that limited the tenants in their modification of the premises and were usually applied to their use of the open space as well, prohibiting such activities as dumping of refuse, building of sheds, or planting private gardens. That a square was an amenity that increased the value of surrounding real estate presup- posed that the housing on a square was more attractive to wealthy tenants than similar hous- ing on streets without squares. While this may seem a truism today, in the seventeenth cen- tury, such was not always the case. Covent Garden failed to develop into the stylish quar- ter envisioned by its landlord mostly due to the filling of the square with market stalls and the presence of prostitutes and pickpockets in the arcades surrounding it. Even St. James's Square, planned from the outset to house the highest nobility, suffered for many years from the dumping of refuse, periodic crowding by cabs and coaches (and the resulting horse manure),</page><page sequence="7">- 1 Figure 2.

When the residents of the square sought relief by an Act of Parliament in 1725, enabling them to close the square and improve its con- dition, they complained that the square "doth now lie and hath from some years past lain rude, waste, uncleanly, and in great disorder" (Report of the Royal Commission on London Squares 1928, 12). Such was also the fate of other squares with unimproved surfaces. Poet John Gay in 1716 described the dangers of crossing one at night (lines 133-138): Where Lincoln's-inn, wide space, is rail'd around, Cross not with vent'rous step; there oft' is found The lurking thief, who while the day-light shone, Made the wall echo with his begging tone: That crutch which late compassion mov'd, shall wound Thy bleeding head, and fell thee to the ground. Those with well-kept lawns and especially those with trees and shrubs, like Leicester Square and Soho Square, seem to have suf- fered much less from such abuse, though they still could be subject to the presence of unde- sirable people at all hours of the day and night. A maintained garden, then, became an asset in efforts to control the public use of these open spaces. In this we can see one of the seeds for the later use of gardens, viz., as ways of ex- pressing control over socially contested space. The amenity value of the gardens in the squares derives as much from the exercise of social control of space as it does from the visual beauty of plantings in the urban landscape. The seventeenth-century squares were so- cially ambiguous landscapes. The land on which they lay was, in most cases, the prop- erty of aristocratic landowners, as were the surrounding houses that were leased to ten- ants. The whole arrangement derived from feudal relations of property: neither the land of the square, that under the houses, nor the houses themselves could be bought and sold except by the landlord. Residents leased a right to use the land and the houses. Some of the squares were in effect commons to which prior residents had old rights of access for pro- ductive activities like drying and bleaching of cloth and for nonproductive activities, such as military training and recreation. They were not entirely private places under the control of the landlord or of the estate tenants who resided around them. Exclusion of the public was difficult and, until the 1720s, not clearly legal. Their visual aesthetic value came more from the architecture surrounding them than from the design of the open area itself, and their social value did not derive directly from an exchange value as real estate since the open space was not available for development. Value depended as much on the prestige associated with the particular square, often expressed di- rectly by the residence of the estate landlord on one side of the square or, in the case of St. James's Square, by proximity to the King's pal- ace and his personal park. In all of this, the squares reflected feudal notions of land value that capitalist values would contest in the eight- eenth century. Standardization of Form, Control of Space It was in the Georgian period that the resi- dential square reached its formal stand- ardization. Beginning with Hanover Square in 1713, all subsequent squares had gardens of turf, with or without trees, and they were fenced (but initially not locked) in attempts to limit public access. In addition the design of the buildings surrounding the square was intended to have some sort of architectural similarity. Cavendish Square followed shortly after, in 1717, with a garden designed by Charles Bridgeman, and Berkeley Square gradually took shape from an irregular open area adjacent to new houses in the 1720s-30s. The garden in Grosvenor Square (Fig. 3) was planted in 1725 with beds of evergreen and deciduous shrubs, and hedges of tightly pruned elms rather than turf, the only exception in the increasingly standardized form of succeeding squares (Sur- vey of London 1980, 113). Many older squares were "improved" at this time, especially those whose public access and ill-defined open space had invited unwanted guests. Square residents developed a new legal arrangement to accomplish their ends of con- trolling the use of the squares: Parliamentary enclosure acts similar to those used at the same time on rural estates. The first was passed in 1726 to enable the residents of St. James's Square to restrict access to the square and to levy a rate on themselves for its improvement and maintenance (Report of the Royal Com- mission on London Squares 1928, 12).

But the legal precedent they set became the preferred instrument of improvement of older squares and for building new ones. Lincoln's Inn Fields were enclosed and pri- vatized in 1735. The residents of the square complained in their petition to Parliament that year that: by reason of the said Fields being kept open many wicked and disorderly persons had frequented and met together therein, using unlawful sports and games, and drawing in and enticing young persons into gaming, idleness, and other vicious courses, and vagabonds, common beggars, and other disorderly persons resorted therein where many robberies, assaults, outrages, and enormities had been and continually were committed (in Sexby 1898, 500). Parliament apparently agreed and allowed the square to be enclosed with an iron fence to which only the surrounding residents had keys. And with that action, the urban com- mon-field tradition quietly died. Other Parlia- mentary enclosures followed, among them Red Lion Square in 1736, Golden Square in 1750, Berkeley Square in 1766, and Grosvenor Square in 1774 (Report of the Royal Commis- sion on London Squares 1928, 162). The re- sults were summed up succinctly by designer and critic James Ralph's description: "Leicester- Square has nothing remarkable in it, but the inclosure in the middle, which alone affords the inhabitants round about it, something like the prospect of a garden, and preserves it from the rudeness of the populace too" (1736, 22). The triumph of the Georgian square model is nowhere better illustrated than in the later transformations of the Moorfields by the City of London. This city park, planted with tree- lined walks in 1606, was itself turned into resi- dential squares in the 1790s. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Moorfields became the gathering place for large crowds of people, from the Methodist revival meetings of John Wesley to the mobs that touched off the Gor- don Riots of 1780. As its social role changed, the city fathers felt it had outlived its usefulness as a public open space for recreation. Reserv- ing one part for artillery practice (today Finsbury Barracks), they used the rest of the Moorfields to build the residential Finsbury Cir- cus and Finsbury Square, under the designs of George Dance the younger, inspired by the success of the Woods at Bath (Hugo-Brunt 1955). The gardens were enclosed and the City reaped the revenue from the expensive lease rents of surrounding houses. The green square had come full circle, transforming even its own progenitor. It is noteworthy that the enclosures were often initiated by the residents of the square, not the ground landlords. The petitions to Par- liament were put forward by groups of tenants to protect the space in front of their houses, their personal amenity, as well as by landlords attempting to maintain the value of real estate. The landlords of the houses surrounding Lin- coln's Inn Fields even tried to intervene to pre- vent the tenants from taking control of the gar- den but were rebuffed by Parliament (Records of the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn 1899, 470). The enclosures were a major step away from the feudal forms of property relations and to- ward capitalist forms. The extinguishing of common rights of access to them was a direct parallel to the enclosures taking place in the countryside as estate owners evicted peasants to create scenic landscape parks. That the gar- dens in the squares were maintained and used communally by the estate residents still re- tained some of the older forms of use. But their value changed significantly as they became amenities with a definable monetary value in the real estate market of building leases and property development. They were seen in- creasingly as economic assets to the ground landlords who owned them, by raising the value of surrounding property, and as social assets by the leasehold tenants who had sole access to them once the public was excluded. Rural Aesthetics in the Urban Landscape The aesthetic goals of the enclosures were only vaguely defined. The Parliamentary Act for Golden Square authorized its inhabitants to "inclose, pave, repair, enlighten, adorn, and beautify" it. The Act for Grosvenor Square en- abled the residents to "inclose the said garden in a more substantial manner, and to alter and embellish the same." Much more attention was</page><page sequence="11">100 Lawrence paid in the Acts to the legal arrangements for assessing fees and extinguishing rights of com- mons and of public access. The main purpose of the Acts of enclosure was to legally em- power the inhabitants of the squares to form associations for their joint responsibility and to extinguish old common rights. Taste cannot be discounted, however, for it was a reflection of the social control of the urban landscape and the basis of the continu- ing appeal of the squares in later years. In the late seventeenth and early eighteenth centu- ries, there was considerable turmoil in the de- velopment of aesthetics in both architecture and gardening in England. Continental influ- ences were dominant, Italian, French, and Dutch. But by the early decades of the eight- eenth century, there began to appear a dis- tinctly English aesthetic in architecture, based on late Renaissance Italian models. The canoni- zation of architectural design in the early eight- eenth century resulted in the "Rule of Taste" based on British interpretations of the rules of the Venetian architect Palladio (1965; Burke 1976, 3-37). There developed more slowly a garden aesthetic based on continental land- scape painting (Dutch, French, and Italian influences were pronounced) rather than on continental garden design. By the 1720s, a dis- tinctly English way of designing rural land- scapes emerged (Watkin 1982; Jacques 1983). Developed and perfected on rural estates and reflecting an antiurban sentiment, its pastoral aesthetic became the main inspiration for gar- den design in Britain by the mid-eighteenth century. Both architecture and landscape aesthetics shared a rural basis. Palladio developed his ar- chitecture most extensively in rural villas owned by town-dwelling Venetians (Cosgrove 1984, 135-41), and the landscape paintings that influenced English landscape design were scenes of idyllic, even mythic, nature. In Eng- land of the seventeenth and eighteenth centu- ries, both social status and wealth derived largely from possession of rural estates and the farm rents they produced. The wealthy resi- dents of the first squares of London were al- most all owners of rural estates, which were their primary residences. They came to the capital mostly for the social "season" in the winter months when estate life became both boring and cold. Spring and fall were often spent at resorts such as Bath, Tunbridge Wells, or Cheltenham; summers were spent on their estates. Rural living carried with it also a moral di- mension. It was felt to be superior to town living, just as agriculture was felt to be morally superior to commerce and manufacturing as a source of income for the wealthy (Williams 1973, 35-59). The use of rural aesthetics in the design of urban residential squares conveyed this moral sense as well. The gardens in the squares were statements that the residents were really rural at heart and resided in the city by necessity as much as by choice. This same standard led many of the rising bourgeois to purchase country estates, as soon as they could afford them, to legitimate their arrival into the class of the wealthy. Open and Closed Gardens: The Increasing Importance of Trees The aesthetics of the square gardens were in flux through most of the eighteenth century. Contemporary views show a wide range of conditions, from open pavement to grass plots to tree-lined walks. But there was a noticeable trend over the course of the century from open to closed, from grass and gravel to trees and shrubs. The details of the layout of the gardens in the squares are difficult to docu- ment as there are few remaining records of original design plans or gardeners' work. The best extant evidence lies in views of the squares made by contemporary draftsmen and topographers, though the record is fragmen- tary before the 1 720s. Chief among these were Sutton Nicholls (whose views of London's squares from the 1720s-50s show them at a pivotal point in the development of the form), Thomas Bowles (1 750s), Edward Dayes (1780s), Thomas Malton (1790s), and Rudolph Ackermann (1 81 Os). In the middle of the eight- eenth century, most views show plain turf plats, though a few, such as Red Lion, Leicester, and Charterhouse, had neat rows of trees, and Grosvenor Square was unique with its beds of shrubbery. From these and later views, it is clear that through much of the eighteenth cen- tury, trees and shrubs in all the squares were kept far enough apart or low enough to allow views across and through the open space. Small trees such as laburnum were used most</page><page sequence="12">The Squares of London 101 often and when larger ones such as lindens and hornbeams were used they were usually tightly pruned and pleached (branches plaited or interlaced). Nowhere were the plantings dense enough to obstruct the visual openness of the squares. The visual openness of the early squares was an integral element in their form. They were intended to be open space surrounded by buildings, ideally of uniform design and creat- ing a unified spatial composition. The houses facing each other across a square were a social setting as much as an aesthetic achievement. Each square was thought of as being like a village, an intimate neighborhood grouping, in the larger context of the city. The class and character of each square's residents were widely known, and though the relatively un- adorned facades presented an impassive mask to the public, the comings and goings of each resident were easily visible to all others. The actual form of the square was its openness, not the plants in its garden. Several of the London squares, Leicester and Bloomsbury in particu- lar, had along one side the mansion of the estate landlord, a view of which was important to the social standing of the other residents. No square depended more on its open sight lines than Hanover Square (Fig. 4), on the northwest fringe of London's built-up area when it was laid out in 1713. The open space was carefully constructed to contribute to the design of the city that would later surround it. Rather than a simple open block, the square was made by setting each of its four corners back from the adjacent intersections. George Street leaving the square on the south side was wider at the end near the square and narrower farther down, creating an exaggerated per- spective. And most dramatically, the new par- ish church, St. George's, was set forward of adjacent buildings encroaching on the line of the sidewalk. As critic James Ralph stated, "the view down George-Street, from the upper side of the square . . . is one of the most entertain- ing in the whole city" (1736, 73). The whole effect of Hanover Square depended on the square being visually open, and it was laid out with turf only rather than shrubs or trees. There were some who considered any vege- tation to be an affront to pure neoclassical ideals. One was the anonymous author of the Critical Observations on the Buildings and Im- provements of London (1771, 7-14): "The no- tion I form to myself of a perfect square, or public place in a city, is a large opening, free and unencumbered. . . . To illustrate this in some degree, I refer to St. James's Square.... You are not confined in your space; your eye takes in the whole compass at one glance." As for the others, however, he (or she) had noth- ing but scorn: Almost every other square in London seems formed on a quite different plan; they are gardens, they are parks, they are sheep-walks, in short they are every thing but what they should be. The rus in urbe is a preposterous idea at best; a garden in a street is not less absurd than a street in a garden; and he that wishes to have a row of trees before his door in town, betrays almost as false a taste as he that would build a row of houses for an avenue to his seat in the country. This represents the pure architectural aesthetic that saw the squares as spatial elements in a composition of stone and brick. It was at odds with the tradition of the cloister garden, the courtyard walk, and the village common that had influenced some of the seventeenth-cen- tury squares. Both of these were being re- placed by another aesthetic in the second half of the eighteenth century, one that saw the open spaces of the squares as aristocratic gar- dens in the city. It was this aesthetic that gained most prominence with the enclosure of the squares. By the third quarter of the century, there was a noticeable trend toward increasing density of vegetation. Larger tree species such as London planes and sycamore-maples were planted, and older plantings of lindens and hornbeams, formerly tightly pruned, were allowed to grow more freely. Even St. James's Square finally ac- quired a lawn to replace most of its stone pave- ment in 1759 (Survey of London 1960, 69). Berkeley Square was enclosed and improved in 1766 with tree-lined walks. It was replanted in 1777 with London plane trees that were allowed to grow to their full height and are reputed to be the oldest surviving plane trees in London (Fricker 1974, 84). Grosvenor Square was enclosed in 1774, its shrub beds were rearranged, and trees previously kept small were allowed to grow up. A view in 1789 shows tall, untrained shrubs and some small trees perhaps 10-15 feet tall beginning to ob- scure the view across the square, and another in 1816 shows trees at least twice that height with buildings barely visible beyond (Fig. 5).</page><page sequence="13">As~~~~~~~~~ .V - 4., zw~~~~~~~~~~~~~-- - l. r~~~~~~~~ a_ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I Fipre 4.

How are we to account for this transforma- tion of the squares from open lawns to shady parks? Most of the changes involved major renovations of the gardens, not just a lack of pruning. One strong influence came from the changing styles of landscape gardening in the eighteenth century. While early Georgian gar- dens were based on the composition of a se- ries of framed views, often with artificial archi- tectural elements inserted to recall scenes from Classical literature, by the end of the century, the goal was to evoke an image of nature itself, using broader views over the countryside, framed by trees and woodland. Of course, the countryside in view was cleared of fields and farmers and turned into an arcadian prospect of pastures, woodland and water. In this the role of trees changed significantly, from back- ground in a pictorial composition to an essen- tial element in the view itself. The naturalistic English school of gardening drew inspiration from the nascent romantic spirit of the times, one element of which was what Thomas has called the "worship of trees" (1982, 212-23). In the eighteenth century, trees were invested with anthropomorphic at- tributes; they were planted to commemorate the births and deaths of loved ones, and their cutting was protested vigorously by those who valued them as much as their favorite pets. Many aristocratic families took venerable old trees as tokens of their lineage and had their portraits painted. The composition and charac- ter of woodland in estate planning became im- portant enough to take on social overtones. Trees became symbols of the possession of landed property; their management was a statement of its economic improvement. Dif- ferent species even acquired partisan political symbolism (Daniels 1988). In short, trees be- came the focus of concern in the aesthetics of the later landscape estates. The gardens in the squares responded to these changes in rural landscape aesthetics in large part because they were also undergoing a change in use at the same time. The residents were spending more time in the city as the century progressed. While the first squares were inhabited by rural aristocrats using their town houses for the winter social season, by the second half of the century, many more of the residents were town-dwellers, both aristo- crats and wealthy commoners. The squares were their major residence and the gardens in the squares became more important to them than they had been to the temporary rural aris- tocrats. The square gardens became their land- scape prospect and borrowed the same aristo- cratic aesthetic to create an "imitation of the country," with its symbolism of possession of the land through the control of nature. The small spaces of the squares posed a se- vere challenge to the skill of garden designers working in the rural idiom. Indeed, Humphry Repton, who laid out the gardens in Bloomsbury Square and Russell Square on the Bedford Estate around 1805, insisted on "the difference between a garden and a park or forest.... No one will, I trust, contend that a public square should affect to imitate the latter" (Fricker 1974, 82). Generally the new style showed itself in the squares by a loosening of the lines of the plantings, the cessation of prun- ing of shrubs and smaller trees, and the plant- ing of larger species of trees. But the switch from rectangular to circular geometry still re- mained rather stiffly formal, and in 1803, the plantings in the squares were criticized for their overuse of dingy evergreen shrubs and for their lack of "picturesque beauty" by J. C. Loudon, who recommended instead the adop- tion of "the principles of natural scenery" and the use of a wider selection of species (1803, 87). By the first decades of the nineteenth cen- tury, squares with turf alone or very few trees and shrubs were considered "naked." George Papworth, in his Select Views of London, felt it necessary to offer an apology for the openness of Portman Square: If this square is inferior, as a promenade, to some others which are more enlivened and diversified by trees and shrubs, its nakedness, however, af- fords this advantage, that the eye of the passenger is enabled to take in the whole at one view; whereas in Grosvenor-square, for example, the prospect of the houses on every side, except that where the spectator may happen to be, is in a great measure obstructed (1816, 43). This statement reveals a change in the aes- thetics of urban landscape design that reflects changes in society at the time. While the early squares were open spaces for display of archi-</page><page sequence="16">The Squares of London 105 tecture and for the aesthetic of the literary and pictorial prospect, which were the major status emblems of early Georgian rural aristocracy, the later squares turned to the aesthetic of the landscape park with its trees and woodland, symbolic of the property rights of estate own- ers. The gardens in the squares thus began to convey meanings more in line with property values in an economic sense than in a social sense, just as the enclosures were changing the value of the squares as amenities in the urban landscape from feudal social values to capitalist property values. Spatial Transformations: The Creation of Townscape The standardization of the form of the resi- dential square that was achieved during the early eighteenth century also included the achievement of an architectural uniformity in the design of the surrounding buildings based on a strict interpretation of Palladian rules (Summerson 1977, 381-86). The greatest ex- amples in architectural uniformity surrounding residential squares, however, were to be found outside London, in Bath and Edinburgh, where the squares were used not just to create neigh- borhoods but to reshape entire towns. In Bath, where Londoners and provincial gentry mingled at the spa, the work of John Wood, Sr. and his son John Wood, Jr. built the Queen Square in 1732, the King's Circus in 1754, and the Royal Crescent in 1767, to be followed by squares and crescents by other designers (Neale 1981). The Woods turned the terrace and square into a plastic urban form that created and connected a series of spaces that in effect became the landscape of the resi- dential section of the resort town. What the West End of London had become by accretion and accident between 1660-1730, Bath be- came by design during the next 35 years. The year after the Royal Crescent was begun in Bath, construction started on the New Town at Edinburgh based on James Craig's design, using a series of linked squares to create another urban fabric (Youngson 1966). At the same time, London remained an un- connected series of individual developments; its streets and squares could not be said to form a composite urban landscape as much as a pastiche of separate landscapes. The lack of unity did not go unnoticed. In 1766 the de- signer and critic John Gwynn published his London and Westminster Improved, in which he laid out a plan for reorganizing the street network of the western side of the metropolis. Without commenting on the design of gardens in the squares, Gwynn called for "a range of squares, each of the same size with Grosvenor Square" as the centerpieces of a regularized grid of streets. Little came of it at the time, though his recommendations were debated widely and provided an image for many years. By accepting the contemporary squares as the basis for his proposed system of open spaces, Gwynn confirmed them as the unquestioned norm of his own day and showed how they could be the basis for comprehensive town planning. His proposed master plan of im- provements covered only the western half of town, however. It did not extend east of Lin- coln's Inn and left out the parts of the metropo- lis where the people were mainly of the middle and lower classes. In Gwynn's view, the urban landscape was a concept reserved for the up- per classes, just as the residential squares were. By the 1 780s a major change was evident in the squares in London. There was greater di- versity in the shapes of their spaces, as London began to imitate Bath's circus and crescent forms (Hugo-Brunt 1955). The transformations also reflected an increasingly sophisticated aes- thetic sensibility that began to appreciate the urban scene for its own landscape qualities. Steeped in the pictorial rural landscape aesthet- ics of the time, educated observers by the end of the century were able to see the city itself as a picturesque composition of sorts. In this they were aided by the uses of ornamental open spaces and their greenery within the ur- ban fabric. The sense of townscape was not only an aesthetic sensibility. It was also an engineering one, expressed in a series of laws aimed at improving the quality of the urban infrastruc- ture. Beginning with the City of London Light- ing Act of 1736 and more comprehensively in the Westminster Paving Act of 1762, the me- tropolis (and later the provincial towns) began to systematically pave, drain, and light its streets, and to provide sidewalks for pedestri- ans (Cruickshank and Burton 1990, 3-22). The London Building Act of 1774 extended this spirit of standardization to land development</page><page sequence="17">106 Lawrence and construction practices. In all of this, the planning and design of the residential squares provided a model that was influential in the development of larger applications of planning and design controls in London. The economic opportunities in estate devel- opment were enormous and the sense of townscape was felt keenly by the commercial sensibilities of the great estate landlords as they enlarged the scale of their development proj- ects at the end of the century. The fifth Duke of Bedford tore down his ancestral mansion and ripped out its gardens in 1800 to begin the laying out of seven squares and connecting streets of his Bloomsbury development, not completed until some fifty years later (Olsen 1982, 49-73). And the development of Bel- gravia on the lands of Lord Grosvenor beyond Buckingham Palace, beginning in 1821, went beyond the lessons of Bath and Edinburgh, cre- ating the most complete urban composition in Britain up to that time, viz., a series of inter- connecting streets and squares that finally re- alized much of John Gwynn's visions of fifty years earlier (Summerson 1978, 193-95). To this day, Belgravia remains one of the most fashionable neighborhoods of London and contains some of the most expensive real es- tate in the world. Integral to these and later developments, such as Tyburnia in Bayswater (Fig. 6), were linked series of spaces, some square, some oval, some long and linear, ap- proaching the dimensions of later parkways, creating unified urban compositions. The Domestication of Open Space: From Public Piazza to Private Park The changes in the gardens also responded to changes in the use of outdoor space in the city. The earlier squares depended on their vis- ual openness for their social role: they pro- vided sight of all the houses of the square and a full view of all who walked in the square itself. To walk in an open square was to promenade publicly and the purpose of the promenade was to meet and to be seen by others doing the same; it was a social act, and the square was a special place for meetings and conver- sations. John Wood, Sr. had described his pur- pose in laying out Queen Square and King's Circus in Bath: "The intention of a square in a city is for people to assemble together, and the spot whereon they meet ought to be separated from the ground common to men and beasts, and even to mankind in general, if decency and good order are necessary to be observed in such places of Assembly" (in Neale 1974, 273). The separation from "mankind in general" was the goal of the iron railings and locked gates enclosing squares since the middle of the eighteenth century. The visual openness im- posed a kind of social control by allowing for observation of the movements of everyone in the square. But the visual openness of the grassy squares did not prevent passers-by from looking into the square and did not provide much seclusion to those privileged to be in- side. And by the end of the eighteenth century, some kind of seclusion became necessary for people to observe "decency and good order" in their assembly. The street life of London had changed markedly from that of a half-century earlier (Corfield 1990). A rapid growth of the city's population, fed largely by rural migrants of the lower classes, had increased the density of street traffic, and their poverty had increased the incidence of street crime. The streets teemed with strangers, and even a well- dressed person could no longer safely be as- sumed to be a gentleman. Private pleasure gar- dens like Vauxhall and Ranelagh were popular at this time (Wroth 1896), and the promenade in public parks died out as a social activity of the upper classes by the end of the eighteenth century. This was most notable at the Mall in St. James's Park, whose invasion by the middle classes was bemoaned by John Gwynn as early as 1766 (p. 88). The increasing density of vegetation in some of the squares provided for another use of open space: they became small private parks, frequented in daytime by nannies tending chil- dren and footmen walking pet dogs, and in the summer evenings, by key-holding families out for a breath of fresh air. The trees and shrubs provided a modicum of visual privacy, but the biggest change was in the minds of those using the squares. Rather than resorting to them for social encounters and public display, they went for private relaxation, as individuals and as families, privileged to have a park of their own</page><page sequence="18">-:7v ~ ~ ~ - MAI~~~~~~~~~~- ~0 Fig ure 6.

By the nineteenth century, the process was widespread. St. James's Square, once the para- gon of the open square, was planted with shrubs including "a screen of plantation ex- tending round the interior of the railing of about ten feet in width" in 1817, according to plans by John Nash, the designer of Regent's Park, and in 1825 linden and laburnum trees were added to the garden (Survey of London 1960, 69). The changes in the use of the squares are seen in drawings and prints at the end of the century. Children are shown with their parents, nursemaids are shown pushing carriages. The squares became extensions of the private lives of their occupants. In short, they had become domesticated, transformed from public piazzas into private parks. The Roots of Suburbia The appeal of living in the residential squares lay not just in the prestige of the particular estate or in the amenity of the garden in the square. It also lay in the location of the neigh- borhood at the edge of town. Almost all of the squares were built on previously open ground at the fringe of the built-up area at the time, and beyond them lay open countryside (Fig. 3). Development of the Grosvenor estate began around 1725, and much of the neigh- borhood was still not finished twenty years later. Despite contemporary accounts, most of the rapid growth of the population of London in the eighteenth century took place after 1750. Between 1700-50 the population was virtually unchanged, from 674,350 to 676,250 (George 1925, 319). Fashionable Westminster and the western parishes did increase from 139,000 to 174,000 in the first half of the cen- tury, but even this was a gain of only 25 per- cent over fifty years. This slow growth meant the squares and their neighborhoods were, for many years, in suburban locations relative to the heart of the city. Some remained at the very edge of devel- opment for several decades. Queen Square in Bloomsbury was built up on only three sides for its first sixty years and had a view of the countryside to the north including the hills of Hampstead and Highgate (Fig. 2). Not only was the view better at the edge of town, but the air was cleaner away from the stench of open sewers in town. While new squares were praised for their salubrious air, free of the noi- some taint of older neighborhoods, later devel- opment eventually surrounded them with buildings and streets, and they lost their sub- urban location by default. As this happened, they often lost their prestige as well. The houses around Grosvenor Square also included another landscape amenity missing in the older squares: private rear gardens (Fig. 3). Since the middle of the eighteenth century, much of the new housing for the middle and upper classes in London had included small backyards that were often turned into gardens (Longstaffe-Gowan 1990). Private gardening became somewhat of a fad and there arose a lively commercial nursery and job-gardener trade. The new value given to truly private out- door space was in large part a response to the increased emphasis on family life and the seg- regation of residential space from the other activities of daily life that were then beginning to transform British society (Stone 1977). The domestication of the squares is reflected also in the change in character of their sur- rounding neighborhoods. Their location off the major streets with limited access to them, away from the noise of traffic and street commerce, added to their appeal. Most of the later proj- ects such as Bloomsbury were purely residen- tial, without the shops and markets that char- acterized the side streets of earlier square development projects. Like Bloomsbury, many had barriers at the street entrances to the neighborhood that denied entry to through traffic, peddlers, and any pedestrians without business on the estate (Olsen 1982, 145-50). By the early nineteenth century, the squares and their residential neighborhoods began to express a new set of landscape values, reflect- ing a bourgeois sensibility centered on family and on the home as possession rather than as social venue. The attempts at isolation from the busy life of the city and its diverse social classes were difficult to achieve on the squares despite the street gates and the garden gates. A small garden behind the house allowed only a token private landscape space; the garden in the square in front provided a pleasant little park and carried suitable rural aristocratic overtones, but it lacked privacy. In the end, the desire for a larger private landscape space that had been</page><page sequence="20">The Squares of London 109 nurtured by the Georgian residential squares finally outgrew their confines. This new sensi- bility expressed the values of the middle classes as they rose to positions of wealth and influence after the turn of the nineteenth cen- tury. While some of them had purchased houses in villages outside London since the middle of the eighteenth century (Fishman 1987, 39-72), the limitations of travel pre- vented the growth of any extensive suburban settlement until the mid-nineteenth century. But the first manifestation of the physical form of the suburban house in the city arrived sooner, in the 1820s, with the completion of Regent's Park at the northwest edge of Lon- don. Regent's Park was a royal domain built from open countryside as an exclusive residential area. It brought about simultaneously several innovations in landscape forms that have an influence to this day. It took the form of the royal park in a suitably pastoral design, sur- rounded it with large blocks of terrace housing, and sprinkled it with detached houses called "villas" (Fig. 7). Regent's Park was initially a pri- vate park with gates at the entrances, but suit- ably dressed visitors were allowed on the main roads through it. In the 1830s, yielding to pub- lic pressure, the Crown opened the park in the center to the public by stages. It represents in physical form a metaphor for the transition in landscape symbolism that was to turn the resi- dential square into suburbia. At its southern end, closest to town, it began with a crescent, linked to a square, and this opened up to the park, which was flanked on both sides by blocks of terraces, in effect opening up and expanding the form of an enclosed square and grafting it onto the form of the large landscaped park. Several villas were placed in the park, almost as miniature country houses; others ap- peared in two picturesque groupings, Park Vil- lage East and Park Village West, adjacent to the park. The whole ensemble was without prece- dent. This effort was also a successful real estate venture. The value of the housing derived in large part from the amenity value of the park at the center, and that derived largely from its privacy and greenery, just as in older residential squares. But by placing a large park at the cen- ter instead of a small square garden, the de- signer created a new kind of private residential space, a large domestic park where individuals and families could enjoy the romantic beauties of nature and where children could safely play. That Regent's Park was later opened to the public does not obviate its private origins or the strength of the movement toward privati- zation and domestication of open space that it represented. It merely showed the inappropri- ateness of a city location for such housing and confirmed the exurban rationale of residential development in later years. It also marked a major development and turning point in the trend toward residential segregation and do- mestication of open space that began in the late eighteenth century in the green squares of London. From Private Squares to Public Parks In the early nineteenth century, the green square and its permutations in circus and cres- cent were still the most common elements in the shaping of new elite sections of British towns. Late Georgian and Regency towns de- pended on the square as the organizing device for almost all new urban residential expansions in upper and upper-middle class areas. In Lon- don from 1800 to the third quarter of the cen- tury, the Bloomsbury, Belgravia, Bayswater, and Pimlico areas, among others, were built around a series of small green open spaces, some square, some oval, some long and linear. Al- most all were planted heavily with shrubs and trees, and almost all the green spaces were fenced in, reserved for the private use of sur- rounding tenants (Olsen 1976, 162-69). By the 1 830s the need for public open space was becoming acute in some of the older parts of London, and the private green squares were eyed longingly by nearby residents denied ac- cess to them. The cholera epidemic of 1832 struck particularly harshly in the crowded slums areas of London, especially in the east- ern part of town. Tens of thousands died. The prevailing medical knowledge of the time blamed the disease on "miasmas" fed by dampness, darkness, and still air (Pelling 1978). One of the cures recommended, in addition to the provision of sewers and clean water, was to open up the urban fabric to let in light and air. Yet there were very few public open spaces anywhere in London.</page><page sequence="21">1 Ire (D Figure 7. Plan of Regent's Park in the 1820s.

Three other royal parks, also on the western side of town, St. James's Park, Kensington Gardens, and Regent's Park, were open only to "persons well-behaved and properly dressed" (Report of the Select Committee on Public Walks 1833, 5). The Committee suggested several places where public walks could be created and called for admission of the general public to Regent's Park. The motive for opening the parks was not pure altruism, however. The Committee felt that one of the principal benefits would be an improvement in the character of the poor. "Open places reserved for the amusement (un- der due regulations to preserve order) of the humbler classes, would assist to wean them from low and debasing pleasures." The Com- mittee also cited the "advantages which the Public Walks (properly regulated and open to the middle and humbler classes) give to the improvement in the cleanliness, neatness and personal appearance of those who frequent them." This would exert "the most powerful effect in promoting Civilization, and exciting Industry" (Report of the Select Committee on Public Walks, 1833, 8-9). The residential squares were not felt to be the proper venue for this socializing mission, and they remained locked and private, but the social landscape values they expressed, of genteel people living amid greenery in the city, were those that lay behind the motivation to use public parks to improve the health, manners, and political trac- tability of the working class. Thus, by the 1830s, the urban amenity land- scape had become the concern not just of developers and aestheticians, but also of social reformers, epidemiologists, and the police as well. The residential squares that stood for high status and the values of property provided a model for the use of public parks imbued with another, more vital value, as protectors of the public health and keepers of the public order. Access to open space was increasingly thought to be a right of all town dwellers, not just of the privileged few, and to be a benefit to social and political stability by helping to defuse social tensions that were building to the breaking point. By 1840 Regent's Park was fully opened to the public, and in the 1 840s, Victoria Park was created at the east end of London to provide open space for that part of the metropolis. It was planned as a real estate venture as well, to be ringed with expensive villas, but due to the unfashionability of the area, these drew no buyers and were dropped from the plan (Chadwick 1966, 112-25). Elsewhere in England the residential squares were imitated in the laying out of elite residen- tial quarters from the end of the seventeenth century, but only two towns, Bath and Bristol, were large enough to have more than two squares by 1770 (Borsay 1989, 323-24). In the next fifty years, many more were laid out, es- pecially at resort towns like Brighton and Bath. Beyond England the squares were imitated in Edinburgh, with its New Town of the 1760s and later squares and crescents as it expanded. Dublin gained several by the end of the eigh- teenth century, including St. Stephen's Green, Merrion, Fitzwilliam, and Mountjoy Squares, all very much along the lines of the London squares. And beginning in the 1830s, many cities and towns were laying out public parks, most often with surrounding terraces or villas on the model of Regent's Park, to generate revenue (Chadwick 1966, 65-110). The British Square in America In British colonies overseas, residential squares were used only sparingly, a few in each of the major Australian cities and a hand- ful in Canada, most surprisingly in Montreal as English-speakers moved into the city in the early nineteenth century (Marsan 1981, 139- 43). They were built more extensively in the U.S. after independence from Britain. In colo- nial America, public squares were important in the laying out of many new towns, but most often they were centrally located and func- tioned as civic plazas, town commons, or vil- lage greens rather than as residential squares on the London model. They were generally treated as parks, however, and have become an indigenous landscape form that incorpo- rates rural amenity aesthetics into a public civic context. The courthouse square developed as an especially important variant (Price 1968). The first American residential squares were those in Philadelphia, planned by William Penn in 1682, when the London square was still a</page><page sequence="23">112 Lawrence new and changing landscape form; Penn mod- eled his squares on the Moorfields rather than Covent Garden or Lincoln's Inn Fields. A plan and description of Philadelphia of 1683 de- scribes the intention to lay out a ten-acre square at the center of the city to be sur- rounded by public buildings and four public squares of eight acres in each of the four quar- ters of the city "to be for the like uses of the Moore-fields in London" (Reps 1965, 161). The Philadelphia squares were, in the spirit of Brotherly Love, intended from the first to be public open spaces in the residential quarters of the city, a significant variation of the form developing in London at the same time. Of the four, Rittenhouse Square became the most fashionable, reachings its peak of prestige in the second half of the nineteenth century. A more direct copy of London's residential squares was planned but never built in An- napolis, Maryland. The plan of 1695 called for a Bloomsbury Square, but it was never laid out (Reps 1972, 123). More successful was the re- markable series of squares that formed the basic structure for the town of Savannah, Georgia. James Oglethorpe's plan of 1733 divided the town into wards of forty houses, each with a central square, in effect providing a neighbor- hood grouping much like those of the squares of London (Reps 1965, 195-202). The basic module was replicated as Savannah grew, so that by the time of the Civil War, it had twenty- three such neighborhood squares. They re- main to this day, making Savannah one of the truly remarkable urban landscapes in America. Several other towns were planned during the colonial period on the models of Philadelphia and Savannah, but few grew to any size and what squares they had have become more like civic plazas than residential squares. Ironically, it was in the fifty years after inde- pendence that the British residential square was most widely imitated in the U.S. Boston received the first of the new generation of resi- At . ~t 001, ~ ~ ~ Figre&amp; Lousbug~qaren~otoabotl85.Tesqare asdvelpeintel80saaprvatresdenia squrealng ngis lnes touh he meicn lmsar anatvetoch CortsyoftheBotoia SoieyOl State ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~t House</page><page sequence="24">The Squares of London 113 dential squares in Charles Bulfinch's project for the Tontine Crescent and its little elliptical Franklin Place in 1793. It was clearly modeled on the latest crescents of Bath and London, which he had seen when he studied architec- ture in England (Kirker and Kirker 1964). Later residential squares in Boston included Colum- bia Square in 1801, Washington Place, now Fort Hill Park, in 1808, and Pemberton Square and Louisburg Square in the 1830s, the latter still privately enclosed (Whitehill 1968) (Fig. 8). Lafayette Square in Washington, DC was planned by L'Enfant as a public plaza in front of the White House, but for most of the first half of the last century, it functioned as a resi- dential square, home to such illustrious lights as Stephen Decatur, Andrew Jackson, Daniel Webster, and Henry Clay (Froncek 1985, 124- 33). It has since become Lafayette Park and attained the function originally envisioned for it. In New York City, a "great square" was planned in 1760 but never built (Reps 1965, 154). Later came St. John's Square in 1803 (since destroyed), Union Place (now Union Square) in 1811, Washington Square in 1827, and Gramercy Park in 1831 (Spann 1981). The latter retains a locked communal garden (Klein 1987). Baltimore's Mt. Vernon Place of 1815 and New Haven's Wooster Square of the 1820s are also in the tradition of the British residential square and have kept their residential character though now open to the public. As the nineteenth century progressed, the residential square faded from fashion in the U.S. Almost all have been turned into public parks. Since the middle of the last century, the public neighborhood park has been an impor- tant element in town planning as the demo- cratic nation finally adapted the British form to the American context. At the same time, the two other English forms of green urban land- scape became very important in America, the detached housing of suburbia (Archer 1983; Fishman 1987) and the large city park (Schuyler 1986). Both of these borrowed from the English originals, though, and seem to have been little influenced by American residential squares. Frederick Law Olmsted, the designer of New York's Central Park, for example, had traveled in England and openly admired the new parks built in the 1 840s, particularly Birkenhead Park, near Liverpool (Chadwick 1966, 70-72). But there is an echo of Regent's Park's transition from square to park in the form of modern private golf-course developments ringed by blocks of condominiums and ranch houses. From English Square to French Square The English style of landscape gardening was widely imitated on the continent after the last quarter of the eighteenth century, and after the Napoleonic wars, English taste in general occu- pied a place of preeminence in most of Europe. The large city parks and the villa suburbs began to inspire imitation especially in northern Europe and Germany. But the residential square failed to catch on in most places, one of the few exceptions being Munich at the turn of the century, but even there it was in a con- text of villa suburbia (Nerdinger 1983). It was in France that the British green squares were adapted and transformed and were eventually to make their most lasting direct contribution to the form of cities around the world. As early as 1827, the Board of Health in Paris "ex- pressed the wish to see in the centre of every quarter of the town a spacious square, railed in, and planted with trees, in which the chil- dren of all classes might . . . give themselves up to the exercise suitable to their years, and in which the inhabitants of all ages might enjoy the solar influence, and breathe a purer air than in their dwellings." They also asked for a na- tional law regulating town planning that would ensure such public open spaces. "All the citi- zens will enjoy its benefits with a perfect equal- ity; and the poor man, even more than the rich, will find himself protected by it in his health, in his life, in his happiness" (Trebuchet 1842, 414-15). In the 1840s, when the young Louis Napoleon was living in exile in London, its squares were at the height of their importance as green spaces within the city. The older ones had become genteel little parks, and the newer ones were being built in the smartest new neighborhoods. But they were locked to the general public at a time when epidemic disease in London was thought to be due in part to the lack of open spaces available for the lower classes. When, as Napoleon 1II, he ordered the remodeling of Paris in the 1850s, he carried the image of the British squares with him but in-</page><page sequence="25">114 Lawrence sisted that Parisian squares be open to the pub- lic from the outset and be truly urban parks rather than private gardens (Pinkney 1958, 93- 94). French squares were not laid out only in residential neighborhoods, nor were they al- ways in regular geometric shapes. They were inserted into a variety of openings in the urban fabric in commercial as well as residential areas, and in a much wider social cross-section of the city than was common in Britain (Alphand 1868-73). Along with the tree-lined boulevards and the larger public parks such as the redesigned Bois de Boulogne and the Parc Monceau (also pat- terned after British models), the smaller squares gave Paris a modern system of public green open spaces and corridors that made it the envy of other European cities. The renovations of Paris under Napoleon IlI and his aide Baron Haussmann set a standard for other city plan- ners for years to come, however, and in the international acclaim that accompanied them made these hybrid Anglo-French squares a model for small urban parks in other cities throughout the areas of European influence in the world of the late nineteenth century. Epilogue It is ironic that at just the same time, the mid-nineteenth century, the residential square was beginning to fall out of fashion in Britain for the building of new residential areas. Most new housing for the upper and middle classes after 1850 was suburban villas or semidetached houses, each with its own private gardens in front and behind. Terraces and town houses around a square were important in the devel- opment of many inner suburbs of London through the 1870s, but they were outnum- bered by the villa suburbs springing up all around the metropolis (Prince 1964). By the 1830s most of the squares had trees planted in them, even the formerly open Hanover and Cavendish Squares, and had be- come small parks rather than open spaces. By the 1850s London began to imitate Paris by planting trees along its major new streets, first in new developments at the edge of the me- tropolis (Edwards 1981, 36), and later along new streets cut through older sections of town (Edwards 1898, 58). The special role that the residential squares played in introducing greenery into the urban fabric was superseded by a more general use of trees in many parts of the urban landscape. As the nineteenth century wore on, many of the squares lost their residential tenants, to be replaced by shops and offices. But as the gar- dens in most of the squares remained locked to the public, they became a curious blend of public visual amenity and private recreational amenity for a diminishing clientele. By the 1 880s, serious efforts were under way to open many of the residential squares to public use (Report of the Royal Commission on London Squares 1928). At the end of the nineteenth century, the private street barriers were re- moved, those of Bloomsbury in 1890 and all others by act of Parliament in 1893 (Olsen 1982, 149). Among the major squares, Lin- coln's Inn Fields were opened to the public in 1894,1 but others held out longer. Leicester Square was opened to the public only in 1933; that same year St. James's Square was opened to the public at lunch hours, though gradually the hours have been extended. To this day the gardens of many of the squares in the busiest parts of the city remain locked to the public: Bedford, Manchester, and Belgrave Squares among them. Conclusion The residential squares of London were the centerpieces of a unique form of urban land- scape that was important for more than two hundred years in the morphology of British towns and had strong influence elsewhere. They were the home of the elite classes and reflected their tastes and social consciousness in a concrete and living form. The transforma- tions of the squares responded to changes in the aesthetics of the elite, derived from a rural base of wealth and status, and to changes in the role of property as British society made the transition from late feudal to fully capitalist modes of production. The squares were the arena for the working out of major class ten- sions in the struggle over public and private rights in the urban landscape, a struggle that continues. They developed one of the first ef- fective ways of integrating elements of the natural landscape into the urban fabric. They</page><page sequence="26">The Squares of London 115 provided a social model for the first modern public parks. They represented some of the first expressions of the desires for social segre- gation and privatized domesticated open space that were to form the basis for the land- scape of suburbia. And they became models of urban planning that were adopted and adapted in other cultures to create much of the urban landscape in most areas of European cul- ture in the world today. To understand their role in the creation of urban landscapes, it has been necessary to consider them from a variety of perspectives. The perspective of aesthetics in urban mor- phology has been studied in twentieth-century U.S. residential and commercial landscapes (Duncan 1973; Rubin 1979) in ways that show its role in expressing elite control of the land- scape. In the British context, Summerson (1963, 1978) and Olsen (1976, 1986) point up the advantages of an art-historical approach to the role of aesthetics in understanding the in- tentions of builders of urban environments and the social use of spaces created by them. But they do not fully consider the garden as an integral element in the urban landscape aes- thetic, nor its role in the symbolism of social and economic values about the landscape. The role of nature in the structural relations between economic classes is explained by Harvey (1985, 48-56) in ways that can illumi- nate the role of the garden in the squares of London. He sees the divorce from nature in- herent in the capitalist organization of the means of production calling forth a spontane- ous response from both bourgeoisie and pro- letariat alike for a new relationship with nature. But the new relationship is also based on a fundamental separation from nature, a "mys- tification" of nature (Williams 1973, 125) that ends up treating it as an amenity and as a com- modity that ultimately is subsumed by capital- istic economic processes. This is seen also in the changes of the squares of London, from a functional to an aesthetic role in the urban landscape and ultimately to a commercial one. But it fails to explain fully the interaction be- tween social and landscape processes or to shed much light on the interaction between aesthetics and social tensions in the transfor- mations of the squares. It is the concept of landscapes as symbolic statements, open to a reading of the social relations behind them (Cosgrove 1984), that offers the most valuable avenue of approach to understanding these transformations and especially for appreciating their influence on later landscape develop- ments. The use of ornamental vegetation in the urban landscape is of necessity a cultural act that carries with it some expression, implicit or explicit, of social values. From the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, most European uses of urban ornamental vegetation were shaped by the prevailing tastes of elite social groups, most important the rural aristocracy. While the forms developed on the continent were derived mostly from the garden allee, transformed into malls, cours, avenues, and boulevards in the city, in England the dominant aristocratic gar- den form adopted in the city was the land- scape park. It eventually took three forms, the residential square, the large city park, and the house-and-garden of suburbia. For two hun- dred years, the most important of these was the residential square, and its legacy is felt to- day in the other two which have outlived it. All three landscapes are strong statements of so- cial values, but the gardens in the residential squares provide the key to understanding the evolution of all three. The green squares of London show us the importance of seeing the cultural basis of landscape ideals in under- standing urban morphology as social process. The squares of London developed in a par- ticular cultural situation, but they are by no means unique as symbolic statements of social process in the urban landscape. It would be useful to compare the residential squares of North America and Australia with the British squares to see the ways in which societies with less stratification and different environmental aesthetics arrived at a different working out of social processes in the landscape. Ornamental vegetation can serve as a key to understanding urban landscapes in other contexts. This study has shown the role of elite landscape taste as an expression of social use of space. Investiga- tion of the symbolic meanings expressed by the many forms of the American domestic landscape assemblage of house and garden, from colonial times to the present day, could shed new light on the political and social proc- esses involved in the evolution of the Ameri- can urban landscape. And the planting of street trees in the public landscape of many large cities today expresses a range of social issues in symbolic form, from the community-em- powerment of inner city neighborhoods to the</page><page sequence="27">116 Lawrence protection of exclusive privilege in incorpo- rated bedroom suburbs.

An article in the New York Times (Schmidt 1992) on homelessness in Euro- pean cities reports that "as many as 200 people live at any time in makeshift shelters and tents in Lincoln's Inn Fields, a square that is surrounded by the offices of some of London's most prominent barristers."
