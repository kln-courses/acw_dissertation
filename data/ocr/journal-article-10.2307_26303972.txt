<plain_text><page sequence="1">MARGARET CHERNACK BEAUDOIN Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis: A Critique of His Critics The scientific status of psychoanalysis has long been the subject of considerable dispute. In order to defend the status of psychoanalysis as a science in its own right, it has been argued that psychoanalysis is a natural science like any other. From this position however, one is quickly forced to dismiss the differences between psychoanalysis and the natural sci ences as ambiguities in need of clarification or signs of sci entific weakness and immaturity on the part of psychoanal ysis. On the other hand, it has been insisted that psychoanalysis should be regarded as a purely hermeneutic enterprise. As such, psychoanalysis would deal with meanings and motives, make use of the "method" of identification or re-enactment (rather than empirical verification) in order to understand types of actions. From this position, however, one is forced to repudiate all causal claims made by psychoanalysis as inappropriate to the field of study. If one looks to the Freudian opus to adjudicate in a debate over whether psychoanalysis is more properly re garded as a naturell science or a hermeneutic enterprise, one finds no adequate verdict. Freud often speaks in hermeneutic terms of interpretations of meanings, motives, phantasies, ideas and instinctual representatives. And Freud often speaks in natural scientific terms of causal explanations, cathexes, displacements, quotas of affect and instinctual aims. Thus, in regard to dreams he states "the dream content seems like a transcript of the dream thoughts into another mode of expression, whose characters and syntactic laws it is our busi ness to discover by comparing the original and the transla tion" (1900,277). However, in regard to dreams he also states "Dreaming has taken on the task of bringing back under control of the preconscious the excitation in the Ucs. which has been left free; in so doing, it discharges the Ucs. exci tation, serves it as a safety valve . . ." (1900, 579).

For ex ample, he states "We seek not merely to describe and classify phenomena, but to understand them as signs of an interplay of forces in the mind and as a manifestation of purposeful in tentions working concurrently or in mutual opposition" (1916, 67, my emphases). This apparent disregard for the estab lished boundary between two distinct epistemological realms, is an often repeated phenomena over the whole of Freud's work. Unless this is to be understood as mere sloppy thinking, the possibility arises that Freudian psychoanalysis cannot be properly regarded as either a hermeneutics or a natural sci ence. Instead, psychoanalysis appears to be epistemologically unique in that it partakes of both an historical understanding of the meaning of motivations and an empirical exploration of the effects of causal laws. This implies that the separate methodologies of hermeneutics and the natural sciences are equally insufficient for psychoanalysis. This "special peculi arity of psychoanalysis as a science" (Wallerstein 1976, 228) has been recognized by a number of psychoanalysts [e.g., Eagle (1980), Grossman &amp; Simon (1969), Klauber (1968), Modell (1978, 1984), Sandler &amp; Joffe (1969)]. However, with this recognition comes the need for an epistemological and methodological foundation for psychoanalysis that would ac count for what Wallerstein aptly calls its "double tenancy" (1976, 217). In his work on Freudian psychoanalysis (Ricoeur 1970, 1974a, 1974b, 1974c, 1974d, 1976, 1978, 1981), the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur has attempted to formulate just such an epistemological basis for psychoanalysis. Ricoeur views psychoanalysis as a "mixed discourse." According to Ricoeur, what is mixed or combined at the epistemological foundation of psychoanalysis is a hermeneutics and an en ergetics. Ricoeur's term for this admixture is "semantics of desire" and with this notion he provides the "superordinate conception which would encompass both kinds of discourse" that according to Grossman and Simon (1969,109) is required for psychoanalysis to become a general, scientific psychology. Psychoanalysis is at once a hermeneutics and an energetics, a mixed discourse, a semantics of desire.</page><page sequence="3">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 37 According to Ricoeur, this does not indicate that psy choanalysis is an ambiguous or scientifically unsound theory in need of clarification. Rather Ricoeur wants to show "that there are good grounds for this apparent ambiguity, that this mixed discourse is the raison d'etre of psychoanalysis" (1970, 65). He has in fact attempted to show this in several ways: firstly, in a painstaking, scholarly exposition of Freud's opus; secondly, in a detailed discussion of the ways in which psy choanalysis distinguishes itself from both the methods of the natural sciences and linguistic analysis; and finally by spelling out a method of verification appropriate to the discipline. Despite this Ricoeur has been the subject of extensive criticism from psychoanalytic quarters. Ricoeur's critics can be regarded as falling into one of several categories. A substantial proportion of the criticisms are based upon blatant misunderstandings of Ricoeur's po sition. These criticisms tend to misrepresent Ricoeur's theory as a purely hermeneutic reformulation of psychoanalysis in the tradition of Wilhelm Dilthey, or as a purely linguistic reformulation in the spirit of Jacques Lacan. Remarkably some of those theorists who call for the very epistemological foundation which Ricoeur works out, use Ricoeur as an ex ample of someone who does not recognize the need for such a foundation. For example, Arnold Modell states "psycho analysis encompasses both forms of knowledge [i.e., her meneutic and natural science] and . . . this continues to be the central point of its epistemology" (1978, 151). Yet he also asserts "this paradox was essentially ignored by Ricoeur" (1978, 148). This widespread misrepresentation of Ricoeur deserves to be redressed. A second group of criticisms is based on more substantial disagreements. Here we find arguments regarding the nature of scientific method, the issue of epis temological dualism, and the meaning of 'meaning' in psy choanalysis. In regard to the more substantive criticisms, it will be shown that these critics have not shown Ricoeur's formulation to be erroneous. Further, it will be shown that the alternative formulation suggested raises substantial dif ficulties which Ricoeur's position successfully addresses.</page><page sequence="4">38 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis Ricoeur's Interpretation Theory is Not a Pure Hermeneutics Despite Paul Ricoeur's commitment to the necessity of a mixed discourse as epistemologically foundational for psy choanalysis, his critics have continued to attack him for pre senting a purely hermeneutic position. Ricoeur explicitly states, "if we were only to follow the suggestion of the concepts of the text and interpretation, we would arrive at an entirely erroneous notion of psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis would be purely and simply subsumed under the aegis of the historico hermeneutical sciences, alongside philology and exegesis" (1981, 256). Nevertheless, Ramzy and Shevrin (1976) accuse Ricoeur of maintaining that psychoanalysis is "a purely in terpretive discipline related to such pursuits as deciphering the meaning of a biblical text" (157). What they consider to be their most important objection to Ricoeur is that "if indeed the psychoanalyst deals with a language of desires, there must be some means by which the desires are transmuted into language" (157). This is no criticism of Ricoeur, as such an assertion could easily have been made by Ricoeur himself. Ricoeur himself states: "because the level of expression proper to the unconscious is not language, the work of in terpretation is difficult and constitutes a veritable linguistic promotion" (1978, 312). Ricoeur insists that an economic explanation is required by the very fact that there is a barrier between the unconscious and the conscious, by the fact that there are specific mechanisms which maintain this barrier and by the fact that it is an effort, a work, to overcome this barrier: "Conflicts, formations of compromise, facts of dis tortion—none of these can be stated in a reference system restricted to relations of meaning to meaning" (Ricoeur 1970, 394). Ricoeur is typically criticized for contracting the scope of psychoanalysis by limiting it to the sphere of speech. Im plicit in this criticism, however, is a misunderstanding of what Ricoeur intends by language and semantics. Ramzy and Shev rin (1976), for example, criticize Ricoeur by objecting that "it is not correct that the psychoanalyst depends only on lan guage, important as language is" (157). Maxwell and Maxwell</page><page sequence="5">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 39 (1972) in their review of Ricoeur's Freud and Philosophy, accuse Ricoeur of having a "bias in favor of'the Word' " (519). Robert Holt (1981) states that "Ricoeur .. . wants a sharp restriction of psychoanalytic theory . . . only to what can be expressed in words" (136). Adolf Grunbaum (1984) insists that Ricoeur's view of psychoanalysis "immures its substantive purview within the verbal productions of the clinical transaction" (43). He concludes that for Ricoeur "even the analysand's nonver bal products are excluded from its [psychoanalysis'] scope" and that "Ricoeur's circumscription ... is a mutilation of its [psychoanalysis'] range of relevance" (43). From such statements one would never guess that Ri coeur regards the image rather than language to be primary for psychoanalysis and that he consistently criticizes Jacques Lacan's (1977) assimilation of the unconscious to structural linguistics. Ricoeur states: "Let us be clear on this point. It is in no way a question here of an amputation of human ex perience, which is thereby reduced to discourse. On the con trary, it is a question of an extension of the semiotic sphere as far as the obscure confines of mute desire antecedent to language" (1978, 295—my emphases). Rather than attempt ing to truncate the psychoanalytic realm to speech and lan guage, Ricoeur believes that psychoanalysis broadens the se miotic sphere, the sphere of meaning, to include not only language, but bodily gestures, psychosomatic symptoms, fan tasies and dream images. He can thus be seen to use the term 'speech' in much the same way as Freud (1913) did when Freud stated "in what follows 'speech' must be understood not merely to mean the expression of thoughts in words but to include the speech of gesture and every other method such, for instance, as writing, by which mental activity can be expressed" (176). Critics such as Robert Shope (1973) and Adolf Grun baum (1984) tend to use Ricoeur as a straw man for their attempts to assert a purely causal account of psychoanalytic explanations. Shope (1970, 298), for example, states that Ri coeur regards Freud's notion of wish fulfillment as purely hermeneutic and then, as if to prove his point, proceeds to quote Ricoeur's statement! "to say that a dream is a fulfillment of a repressed wish is to put together two notions which</page><page sequence="6">40 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis belong to different orders" (i.e., an economic order and a hermeneutic order, 1970, 92). Shope goes on to argue that the notion of wish fulfillment is a purely economic one. Whether or not he is correct has no bearing on the point that Ricoeur does not make the opposite claim, i.e., that wish fulfillment is a purely hermeneutic concept, as Shope accuses him of doing. Adolf Grunbaum accuses Ricoeur of incorrectly assim ilating "symptoms to linguistic expressions" (1984, 61) or in stinctual "derivatives ... to linguistic communications" (ibid., 63). Grunbaum argues that the remoteness of such derivatives from their instinctual origins defies such an assimilation. But Ricoeur makes the very same argument in his criticism of Lacan (Ricoeur, 1970, 393), whom Grunbaum nevertheless insists that Ricoeur endorses (Grunbaum, 1984, 65). Where Grunbaum and Ricoeur actually disagree is in whether symp toms, dreams, fantasies or derivatives of any kind are sig nificative at all. For Ricoeur, they clearly do signify, but not— Grunbaum's accusations to the contrary not withstanding— as language signifies: The representing of instincts (Trieben) is thus at the center of our problem. It is neither biological nor se mantic. It is delegated by the instincts and promised to language and reveals instincts only in their deriva tives while gaining access to language only by the twisted combinations of object cathexes which precede verbal representation. We must invoke an irreducible type of relationship between signifiers and signifieds. These signs and meaning effects have a linguistic vo cation but are not, in their specific texture, of the order of language. This is what Freud indicates by the word Vorstellung or representation, and it is what keeps the level of fantasy distinct from that of speech. (Ricoeur 1974c, 169)</page><page sequence="7">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 41 Grunbaum, on the other hand, wants to argue that psy choanalytic phenomena have meaning, express or signify only in the highly attenuated sense of, for example, the way a rain cloud signifies rain or a footprint means that someone walked here.1 This is part of Grunbaum's (and others, such as Robert Shope) argument for a purely causal account of psychoanalytic propositions. The inherent difficulties of such a position, which difficulties are clearly avoided by Ricoeur's position, will be addressed later. In any case, it is simply unfounded on Grunbaum's part to accuse Ricoeur of holding that "repressed wishes were verbal devices of communication" (1984, 65). Unconscious contents are never linguistic for Ri coeur, and repression is regarded by him to require an ec onomic explanation. Ricoeur, in fact, recognizes an inherent danger in a purely linguistic reading of psychoanalysis. Ramzy and Shevrin inevitably reverse the actual state of af fairs in this regard as well, stating that "ironically, Ricoeur's efforts to tie analysis solely to linguistics as a way of bringing it closer to the humanities also brings it close to the brink of therapeutic nihilism" (1976, 158). More ironically however, Ricoeur himself says much the same thing: "A decisive ques tion for metapsychology is whether the recognition of the privileged imaginative level of the processes described by Freud does not make the articulation of the economic and the semiotic aspects of psychoanalysis intelligible, whereas a purely linguistic theory seems to make them almost incom prehensible" (1978, 322). One can only assume that Ricoeur would not write in this way about himself. The more substantive criticisms of Ricoeur's Interpre tation Theory largely center around differing views of sci entific methodology and the correlative issues of validation and verification. Much concern has been directed towards Ricoeur's statements to the effect that psychoanalysis is not a natural science and does not observe facts. Such concerns form the basis of several typical criticisms of Ricoeur's po sition. Ricoeur has thus been accused of presenting an epis temological dualism and of adhering to an old-fashioned and inordinately narrow view of the natural sciences. Alterna tively, it is proposed—usually by those theorists who have</page><page sequence="8">42 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis misunderstood Ricoeur's position to be a pure hermeneu tics—that psychoanalysis is a natural science which like any other natural science, explains via causes and has no com merce with hermeneutic procedures of any sort. In part, these criticisms can be seen to be a consequence of the previous abuse that Freudian psychoanalysis had suffered at the hands of positivistic philosophers of science. Insults directed at Ri coeur's work are all too reminiscent of those thrown at psy choanalysis by philosophers of the symposium on Psychoa nalysis, Scientific Method and Philosophy (Hook 1959). Thus psychoanalytic theory was referred to by Charles Frankel as "a language to say silly things in an impressive way" (cited in Waelder 1962, 618) and Ricoeur's work is referred to by Robert Holt as "evocative verbalism with no clear content" and "inappropriate use of figurative language in the service of self-congratulation, obfuscation, and intimidation" (1981, 136). However, it is our task to put aside such identifications with the aggressor and examine Ricoeur's actual position rather than its feared consequence. The Charge of Epistemological Dualism Ricoeur holds that psychoanalysis does not observe facts but rather interprets reports. This is a disturbing claim if, and perhaps only if, it is assumed that data either comes from observation of external facts or introspection of subjective states. This assumption is the basis of, for example, Charles Brenner's defensive declaration of the scientific status of psy choanalysis, to wit: "Freud did not base his theories on in trospective data, but on observation" (1970, 36). For those who presume this antinomy, if psychoanalysis does not ob serve facts then it becomes relegated to the subjectivism of introspective psychology. However, this old dichotomy of sub jectivism versus objectivism, with its correlative dichotomies of idealism versus realism and mind versus body is not em braced by Ricoeur. Further, Ricoeur regards Freud's notion of the unconscious as spanning and uniting these conceptual oppositions. Despite this, Ricoeur has been criticized for pro</page><page sequence="9">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 43 posing a radical epistemological dualism. James Blight (1981) asserts that both hermeneutics and positivism are alike in maintaining an epistemological "Great Divide" between the natural sciences and the humanities, or between scientific explanation and historical explanation. Of Ricoeur he states, "Ricoeur is a radical epistemological dualist. Scientific knowl edge of the physical world and hermeneutic knowledge of the self-reflective process are simply and utterly different . . . psychoanalysis remains nothing like biology or any other natural science. It rests firmly, according to Ricoeur, on the hermeneutic side of the Great Divide" (167). Similarly, Bar naby Barratt (1976) accuses Ricoeur of proposing "a radical dichotomy between hermeneutic and logical-empiricist knowledge systems, that is, between the acquisition of an interpretive understanding and of a physiocausal explana tion" (456). These charges bear some similarity to those we have previously met with, wherein Ricoeur is mistakenly identified as presenting a purely hermeneutic position. However, some thing more is at stake here. This will begin to be more obvious if we look at two other formulations of the charge of epis temological dualism. Robert Holt (1981) argues that Ricoeur holds that psychoanalysis requires "two theories ... a her meneutics to deal with the meanings and an energetics to deal with man's instinctual life" (131). Holt continues, "The underlying difficulty, I believe, is metaphysical: the more one tends, consciously or not, toward a dualistic position on the mind-body problem, the more one will feel that there is an unbridgeable gulf between the realm of external physiochem ical fact and that of inner meanings, and thus between science and the humanities" (loc. cit.). Similarly, Ramzy and Shevrin (1976) state that "Ricoeur . . . appears to sever utterly any connection between mind and body" (158). Ricoeur is not only being charged with holding that psy choanalysis is a hermeneutic, humanistic discipline which un derstands rather than a natural science which explains, which accusations have already been addressed. He is further being charged with adhering to a methodological, epistemological and metaphysical dualism. Ricoeur, we are being told, believes that psychoanalysis requires two disparate theories, that sub</page><page sequence="10">44 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis jective and objective knowledge are radically distinct and that the mind and body are two disparate entities. It is true that Ricoeur objects to any reduction of se mantics to naturalism, as well as any reduction of the energic hypotheses of psychoanalytic theory to hermeneutic ones. It is true that Ricoeur maintains that the theoretical or clinical hypotheses of psychoanalysis cannot be reductionistically„ex plained by either a purely causal or by a purely hermeneutic account. Nevertheless, Ricoeur is by no means an episte mological dualist. He insists that psychoanalysis requires a mixture of hermeneutic and explanatory procedures, such that these two aspects of our scientific approach to psychoanalytic phenomena compliment and require one another. Ricoeur holds that these two ways of obtaining knowledge do not represent two disparate epistemological or metaphysical realms. Rather, both are equally necessary components of psychoanalytic interpretation. Hermeneutics is required by the nature of that which is to be interpreted as a totality whose parts can be explained or understood only in their context. Hermeneutics is further required by the nature of the subject matter as an ambiguous whole, in regard to which several explanations or understandings are possible. Freud under stood this very well when he stated: The uncertainties which still attach to our activities as interpreters of dreams spring in part from our incom plete knowledge, which can be progressively improved as we advance further, but in part from certain char acteristics of dream symbols themselves. They fre quently have more than one or even several meanings, and as with Chinese script, the correct interpretation can only be arrived at on each occasion from the con text. This ambiguity of the symbols links up with the characteristic of dreams for admitting of 'over-inter pretation.' (1900, 353) However, explanatory procedures are equally required by the nature of the subject matter, i.e., by the nature of the unconscious, as well as by the need for verifying our hy potheses and adjudicating between possible interpretations.</page><page sequence="11">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 45 These two epistemological approaches are not mutually exclusive, rather each is required by the other. Further, these epistemological approaches are both applied to the same ob ject and result in one type of knowledge. Additionally, while Ricoeur is not an epistemological dualist, neither is he a meth odological dualist. His hermeneutics and his energetics, which combine to create the mixed discourse of psychoanalytic the ory, are not two theories but rather two dialectically related aspects of one theory. This singular epistemological foun dation is applicable to both the clinical theory and the meta psychology: "Metapsychology is not a mere additional or op tional construction... psychoanalytic method [i.e., the clinical theory] and doctrine [i.e., the metapsychology] cannot be distinguished" (Ricoeur 1974a, 103-4). Ricoeur views the dualisms of subject/object, mind/body and idealism/realism to be, in an important sense, inapplicable to Freudian theory. The Freudian unconscious is a radical denial of the subjective immediacy of knowledge. Self-knowl edge can no longer be equated with any immediate act of consciousness, such as the Cartesian cognito. However, neither can such knowledge be found in any simple equation with external behavior, which presents one with only a distorted representation of unconscious wishes. Additionally, Freud's concept of the instinctual representative can be seen to bridge the mind/body distinction. Freud (1915) states, "an 'instinct' appears to us as a concept on the frontier between the mental and the somatic, as the psychical representative of the stimuli originating from within the organism and reaching the mind, as a measure of the demand made upon the mind for work in consequence of its connection with the body" (121-22). Instincts in psychoanalysis are that which "represent or ex press the body to the mind" (Ricoeur 1970, 137). The body, for psychoanalysis, is not simply a mental representation nor simply an external object. Psychoanalysis thus can not be reduced to a simple idealism or realism, any more than it can be reduced to linguistics or biology. The notion of instinctual representative is neither purely semantic nor purely biolog ical but a coincidence or intersection of the two. Ricoeur recognizes that, for Freud, the topographic unconscious is a real entity with its own systematic laws, which is separated</page><page sequence="12">46 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis from the system consciousness. This reality of the uncon scious justifies Freud's use of energic metaphors and his nat uralism. However, for Freud, the unconscious is also related to consciousness insofar as that which is unconscious has the possibility of being made conscious. If it were otherwise, one of Freud's explicit goals of treatment, as well as the need for defense mechanisms, and the possibility of interpreting a dream, would be incomprehensible. This relation of the un conscious to the conscious justifies Freud's use of hermeneutic metaphors. Ricoeur insists that, to obtain a proper under standing of Freud's concept of the unconscious, it is not nec essary, or desirable, to choose between an "ideality of mean ing" or a "reality of the id" (1970, 439). Rather than posing an exclusive alternative of regarding the unconscious as meaning or topography, Ricoeur insists that it is properly to be regarded as both. In sum, then, it must be granted that Ricoeur's position can in no way be construed as an epistemological dualism. His position is clearly that Freudian psychoanalysis presents two realms of discourse in a necessary interrelationship. This interrelationship is what gainsays the possibility of one realm being reduced to the other. This interrelationship, this mixed discourse, is what provides a unified epistemological foun dation for psychoanalysis. Whether or not Ricoeur has worked out all of the difficulties adhering to such a position, it remains beyond doubt that the position in no way falls to the charge of epistemological dualism. Observation of Facts or Interpretation of Reports It should be clear by now that Ricoeur's insistence that psychoanalysis does not deal in the observation of facts in no way means that psychoanalysis is relegated to subjectivism or introspectionism. Ricoeur's assertion refers rather to the epis temological status of what counts as a fact and what obser vation thus consists of in psychoanalysis. The "facts" of psy choanalysis, unlike those of behavioral psychology or the natural sciences, are reports made by analytic subjects or</page><page sequence="13">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 47 behaviors manifested by such subjects. These behaviors are "observed" as actions having meanings within a particular context rather than as behaviors perse. Moreover, these "facts" are not only assumed to have meanings, but to have meanings which are not readily apparent and which, as such, must be interpreted. Interpretation is not equivalent to observation. Direct or indirect inferences from observables can only be made to the extent that these observables are essentially un equivocal. Observation in the natural sciences requires the observable to be unambiguous. Psychoanalytic data, on the other hand, are essentially ambiguous. They are manifest meanings which refer to other latent meanings, which latent meanings are pardy revealed and pardy concealed by the manifest meanings. Psychoanalytic data have multiple mean ings, i.e., they are equivocal. That inference from direcdy or indirecdy observed facts takes place in psychoanalysis, as it does in the other sciences and in daily life, is not at issue. What is at issue here is that despite, and in addition to, such inferences from observables, psychoanalytic data is always interpreted data, i.e., an articulation of meanings which are both revealed by and concealed by the data which are to be interpreted. While hermeneutics is thus a necessary condition for psychoanalysis, that is not to say that it is sufficient. Throughout his work on psychoanalysis, Ricoeur goes to great pains to show that hermeneutic and economic expla nations are both necessary in order for Freud's theoretical concepts to be comprehensible and in order for the clinical concepts and clinical situation to be accounted for. However, rather than recounting his argument, what is of importance at present is to examine the feared consequences of his po sition in order to show these concerns to be ill-founded. Modell (1984) states that Ricoeur "denied that psychoan alysts observe anything, claiming to the contrary that there are no facts in psychoanalysis and hence no recurrent con figurations" (148). Nothing in Ricoeur's delimitation of what counts as a fact in psychoanalysis, nothing in Ricoeur's def inition of a psychoanalytic report, requires him to maintain that psychoanalysis is an ideographic science. The nature of psychoanalytic facts does determine, in part, the unique re lationship between theory and fact in psychoanalysis, i.e., that</page><page sequence="14">48 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis the theory needs to account for the interrelationship of her meneutic and economic procedures. However, the interre lationship of these two models, which Ricoeur sees as defin itive of Freudian metapsychology, in no way precludes the establishment of "recurrent configurations." In fact, Ricoeur holds that the validation of those truth claims which can be made on the basis of psychoanalytic facts or reports, rests on clinical generalizations, laws and axioms. Ricoeur's insistence on the interpretation of reports as opposed to the observation of facts in no way keeps him from incorporating "several stages of causal explanation into the process of self-under standing in narrative terms" (Ricoeur 1981, 260). What it does, however, is prevent him from discarding the herme neutic and narrative aspects of psychoanalytic interpretation. He is in no way prevented from addressing problems of validation (Barratt 1976, 456-57), nor is he prevented from allowing psychoanalysis the scientific task of generating hy potheses (Holt 1981, 136). However, because Ricoeur insists that psychoanalysis epistemologically joins hermeneutics with causal explanations, he is required to provide criteria and procedures for the validation of these unique explanations or "interpretations." In regard to these criteria and proce dures, psychoanalysis can be seen to be methodologically dis tinguished from the natural sciences. Hypotheses which are made on the basis of observations of facts require standard empirical, inductive procedures of verification. A science which, additionally, makes interpretations of reports requires other criteria and procedures which Ricoeur spells out in his essay on "The Question of Proof in Freud's Psychoanalytic Writings" (1981). Ricoeur's insistence on the distinction between the in terpretation of reports and the observation of facts does not prevent psychoanalysis from obtaining scientific status, from making generalizations, developing hypotheses or attempting to validate theories. On the contrary, Ricoeur insists on this distinction in order to prevent psychoanalysis from being demoted to second class or immature science as a result of being unable to fulfill criteria which are actually inappro priate to its epistemological nature. Robert Waelder (1962), in his discussion of the Hook (1959) symposium, indicates</page><page sequence="15">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 49 that a typical response to the charge that psychoanalysis is unable to provide adequate evidence for its hypotheses takes the form of an apology: "Against verbal assaults of this kind the defenders of psychoanalysis . . . argued that psycho analysis was still a young science: when given more time, such evidence would eventually be forthcoming" (624). Ricoeur (1970, 344-67) recognizes that if one attempts to apply to psychoanalysis the same evidential criteria that are properly applied to the natural sciences, psychoanalysis will indeed be seen to fulfill these criteria only partially. Ricoeur insists, however, that this is due to the unique epistemological char acter of psychoanalysis as a science and not to its inadequacy or immaturity as a science. As we have argued, the essential ambiguity, or the necessarily equivocal nature, of psycho analytic data necessitates the use of interpretation. Hence, observational criteria, as they are usually understood, do not take account of the full range of psychoanalytic evidence. Ricoeur thus distinguishes psychoanalysis from the natural sciences not on the basis of the type of explanations that each make use of, but rather on the basis of the verificational criteria appropriate to each. In so doing he avoids the apol ogetic position required by those who attempt to validate psychoanalysis as a science on the basis of its ability to fulfill the evidential criteria of the natural sciences. Minimizing Differences: A Narrow View of Science In an effort to minimize the apparent differences be tween psychoanalysis and the natural sciences, Ricoeur's crit ics have accused him of presenting an anachronistic and nar row view of the natural sciences. However, this criticism, whether accurate or not, does nothing to address the real differences between the natural sciences and psychoanalysis and the real difficulties which arise in attempting an iden tification of the two. On the other hand, Ricoeur's position does address such differences and correlative difficulties. Further, it does so without requiring psychoanalysis either to accept a permanent ranking of second class science or to see</page><page sequence="16">50 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis itself as 'not yet fully developed' science and thus accept a temporary ranking of second class science. Barnaby Barratt criticizes Ricoeur for holding to a "nar row perception of the natural sciences as necessarily mech anistic and atomistic, as inevitably involving linear determi nate models of causality, as demanding public observation and as unable to deal with the ideographic" (1976, 456). Holt (1972) criticizes what he terms "Freud's mechanistic image of man" in a similar fashion: "Relativity and quantum theory made the mechanistic model of the universe a dead letter generations ago in the physical sciences ... the reductionistic strain in mechanism has long been seen to be fallacious" (13). Firstly, Ricoeur submits that regardless of whether Freud's energy concepts are adequate or not, some explanation in terms of forces is required for psychoanalytic theory. Sec ondly, Ricoeur would no doubt insist that whether or not such an explanation was modeled on an atomistic mechanism, whether or not it involved linear models of causality, such an explanation while it would be necessary, would not be sufficient, as it would not take full account of the psycho analytic data. Thus, whether or not Ricoeur views the natural sciences as anachronistically mechanistic has no essential bear ing on his argument for the distinction between psycho analysis and the natural sciences. On the other hand, neither does the fact that structural linguistics makes use of non linear models of explanation have any bearing on Ricoeur's argument for the distinction between psychoanalysis and lin guistic analysis. A closer look at Holt's (1962, 1978 &amp; 1981) arguments for the identity of the natural sciences with those sciences which deal with verbal and nonverbal meanings will help us to clarify what is actually at stake and what is actually essential to Ricoeur's position. Holt states: First, is it true that natural scientists don't deal with meanings? Look over the shoulder of a high-energy physicist at the raw data of observation he deals with, for example photographs of tracks left in a bubble chamber by colliding elementary particles. To the un</page><page sequence="17">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 51 trained mind, they might as well have been left by a gaggle of geese on a barnyard; they are as hard to make sense of as an X-ray or an EEG tracing or a Rorschach test psychogram—to anyone who lacks the requisite technical training. With it, meaningless marks take on a great deal of meaning, and distinctions the layman cannot perceive may become good or bad news. (1981, 134) However, this is question begging. The "meanings" that the traces have are not meanings for the bubble chamber as well as for the physicist, whereas the meanings of dreams, for example, are meanings for the analysand as well as for the analyst. Further, the possibility of making use of such data as photographs of traces for the indirect observation of el ementary particle behavior is based on an abstraction. In order to achieve a univocal frame of observation which can be explained by reference to a consistent univocal observation language, intervening variables of the concrete situation must be factored out. One must begin with facts which are arbi trarily demarcated and devoid of any original meaning. Such artificial constructs are necessary for the purpose of obser vation and inference therefrom. On the other hand, a piece of psychoanalytic data cannot be interpreted outside of the situation in which it occurs or outside its relationship to some historical context. This is not to say that nomothetic laws cannot be abstracted from such data. However, such laws are derived less from correspondence of the data with an inferred actual occurrence, than from coherence of the data among each other. Additionally, the reports, "facts" or data them selves are necessarily equivocal in psychoanalysis, whereas the pictures of the particle traces aim at being unequivocal. It is for this reason that one factors out such possible interfering variables as lens dust, poor exposure, or influences of the equipment, whereas one does not factor out the analyst's interventions, the analysand's memory lapses, or the influ ence of the previous session. Holt (1978) has made much use of one additional ar gument in his attempt to minimize the difference between</page><page sequence="18">52 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis the procedures of proof in the natural sciences and those in a science such as psychoanalysis. He consistently points out that the natural sciences make use of what could be regarded as hermeneutic procedures, and he uses this observation as evidence that the sciences are thus not different in any es sential way. However, this conclusion simply does not follow from his observation. For that matter hermeneutic proce dures, as well as causal explanations, are made use of by all of us in our daily lives, but our daily lives are not thus sci entific. Clearly, the natural scientist makes use of hermeneutic procedures insofar as he makes judgments, creates theories, etc. However, the difference here is that hermeneutic pro cedures are in no way an essential part of the procedures of verification in the natural sciences whereas, Ricoeur argues, they are an essential aspect of the means of proof in psy choanalysis. Ricoeur's claim that psychoanalysis makes use of causal explanations does not negate his claim that psychoanalysis and the natural sciences must be distinguished on the basis of their verificational criteria. Likewise, Holt's claim that the natural sciences make use of hermeneutic procedures does not negate the claim that there are essential differences be tween these sciences and psychoanalysis. As Donald Spence (1982) has pointed out, despite the fact that theories of the natural sciences are like psychoanalysis in that they depend upon paradigms for their construction and discovery (Kuhn, 1962), psychoanalytic data remain distinct from the data of the natural sciences. Whereas in the natural sciences, para digms determine what one discovers to be a worthwhile piece of reality to observe, the consequent observations form the basis for hypotheses which can then be empirically verified. In psychoanalysis, on the contrary, paradigms determine not only what one will focus upon as an object of investigation, but also determine the "observations" one makes of the par adigm determined objects of investigation. As Spence puts it "every attempt at naming first requires an interpretation; the raw data of the clinical happening are of a different order from [the raw data of physics]" (1982, 245). For the natural sciences, the procedures of empirical verification provide a way out of any hermeneutic circle2 which may be implied by the place that paradigms have in</page><page sequence="19">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 53 determining its arenas of investigation and its theoretical con structs. For psychoanalysis, however, the hermeneutic circle cannot be eliminated from procedures Of verification, because it is implied in the very nature of psychoanalytic data, i.e., reports, and psychoanalytic observation, i.e., interpretation. It should not be forgotten, however, that while Ricoeur insists on the necessity of hermeneutic explanations in psychoanal ysis, he insists on the necessity of causal explanations as well: "To prove this point it will suffice to think about what makes a narration an explanation in the psychoanalytic sense of the term. It is the possibility of inserting several stages of causal explanation into the process of self-understanding in nar rative terms" (Ricoeur 1981, 268-69). His criteria for the validity of psychoanalytic interpretations combines both types of explanatory procedures, as well as their relationship to the metapsychological theory and to the clinical narrative. Psychoanalytic Interpretation and Causal Explanation We have previously stated that some of Ricoeur's critics, such as Adolf Grunbaum and Robert Shope, use Ricoeur as a straw man in their attempt to argue for a purely causal interpretation of Freudian theory. We have already discussed some of the ways in which these criticisms are erroneous. It has been shown that it is a mistake to regard Ricoeur's position as a pure hermeneutics and that it is a mistake to view Ri coeur's assertions about unconscious signification to be equiv alent to linguistic signification. We have previously stated that the actual difference between Ricoeur's position and that of a Grunbaum or a Shope, is that while Ricoeur insists that unconscious meanings—i.e., unconscious derivatives gener ally, or symptoms and dreams specifically—are "expressions," Grunbaum and Shope insist that unconscious derivatives are merely "marks." This is another way of saying that Ricoeur believes that both hermeneutic and causal explanations are necessary for psychoanalysis, while Grunbaum and Shope believe that causal explanation alone is both necessary and sufficient. What we have yet to address, and what we will now turn our attention to, are the problems that arise in holding</page><page sequence="20">54 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis to a purely causal account of psychoanalytic propositions. In making these problems more explicit we are providing an additional argument for the value of Ricoeur's epistemolog ical position. In examining the inherent difficulties of a purely causal account in psychoanalysis, we will leave aside the problematic aspects of the concept of causality itself, since such issues apply equally to any and all uses of causal explanations and thus do not provide an argument against the usage of causal explanation as the sole explanatory modality for psycho analysis. We will also leave aside the apparent difficulty of using causal explanations as explanations of motives, which difficulty arises from applying a concept to states of one and the same agent which is usually applied to a relationship between two substances or agents. We shall not become en tangled in this issue, since it is clear that Freud does make use of causal explanations and that Ricoeur and this final group of critics have no disagreement with this claim. Thus we will assume that psychoanalysis makes use of causal ex planations and does so legitimately. What we will question is whether it does so to the exclusion of any other type of explanation, and what the consequences are if psychoanalysis is interpreted in this fashion. Neither Grunbaum (1984) nor Shope (1973) dispute the simplest and most obvious of Ricoeur's claims, that Freud speaks in terms of causes and in terms of meanings and intentions. However, Grunbaum and Shope must explain the later terms away. They do so by reinterpreting Freud's usages of terms like 'meaning' or 'intention,' and by disregarding statements to the contrary as mere analogies, momentary lapses and anthropomorphic figures of speech. Grunbaum quotes Freud's explanation of parapraxes which he is then at pains to explain away: "Psychoanalysis . . . profits by the study of the numerous little slips . . . which people make— symptomatic actions, as they are called ... I have pointed out that these phenomena are not accidental . . . that they have a meaning and can be interpreted, and that one is jus tified in inferring from them the presence of restrained or repressed impulses and intentions" (Freud 1925,46-47, cited</page><page sequence="21">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 55 in Grunbaum 1984, 64). This is a perfect example of Freud's mixed discourse. According to what Freud states here, if these phenomena are just accidental and we are only justified in inferring repressed impulses from them, they would not be slips; for they also have meanings which can be interpreted, and one is justified in inferring the presence of intentions from them as well. Shope cites Freud's recognition of the expressive aspect of dreams and explains it away as follows: "Freud does suggest taking as communication the dreams of persons actually in therapy. But since he speaks anthropomorphically of motives as 'saying' something in a disguised way, he is apparently using a figure of speech, and is regarding those dreams as communications merely in the sense of a transmission of information to the analyst from clues" (Shope 1973, 302). It is likely, however, that Freud himself would not sanction Shope's manner of argumentation. On the contrary, Freud states: "it is not at all necessary to outgrow it [anthropomor phism]. Our understanding reaches as far as our anthro pomorphism" (cited in Grossman &amp; Simon 1969, 78). In con trast to those who maintain that psychoanalysis intends to make sole use of causal explanations, Ricoeur is able to ac count for the implication of Freud's statement, that an an thropomorphic manner of speaking or theorizing is not a mistake, but a requirement for full understanding in psy choanalysis: Now why does Freud get himself into such difficult straits with concepts which remain semi-metaphors and, in particular, with inconsistent metaphors which tend towards the polarity of, on the one hand, the textual concept of translation and, on the other, the mechanical concept of compromise, itself understood in the sense of a result of various forces interacting? I suggest that it is the conjunction of the investigatory procedure with the method of treatment that compels the theory to operate in this way. (Ricoeur 1981, 257) Grunbaum and Shope both argue that psychoanalytic phenomena such as parapraxes, symptoms and dreams are</page><page sequence="22">56 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis merely signs or marks which have no more meaning than, for example, rock strata or footprints. Like an organic symp tom indicating the presence of physical disease, or like an accumulation of dark clouds indicating that rain is on its way, psychoanalytic phenomena are merely effects of causes and as such have no important or relevant relationship of meaning or signification to the causes of which they are mere traces or marks. These traces are merely 'substitutes' or 'stand-ins' for unconscious causes and do not 'express' or 'signify' such causes. In order to buttress their arguments, both quote Freud (1916) where he says "a dream does not want to say anything to anyone. It is not a vehicle for communication" (231). Firstly, even if this out of context statement were to be taken quite literally as it stands, it certainly does not provide any proof for the claim that manifest dreams have no mean ingful connection to latent dream thoughts. Something can certainly be meaningful even if it is not intended to be com municated. This is the case, for example, for all so-called "private languages." Secondly, if one places Freud's statement back into its context one sees that he is comparing dreams to ancient languages, wherein the ambiguity of such "systems of expression" can only be resolved by "the hearer's under standing" which "is guided by the context" (Freud 1916, 230 31). He goes on to say that the ambiguity of dreams is even more difficult to resolve than that of other "primitive systems of expression" because "it is meant to remain ununderstood" (loc. cit.). In other words, the dream work serves the function of keeping the meaning of the latent dream thought out of consciousness by allowing the meaning into consciousness only in a disguised and distorted form. Thirdly, if one in terprets Freud's statement, as Grunbaum and Shope have, as an assertion to the effect that dreams do not express any meaning, but are only non-meaningful marks or traces of unconscious processes, several serious problems become ap parent. In the first place, Grunbaum and Shope take for granted, but never address, the issue of plausibility, i.e., what would a mental content that has no intentional structure or meaning be like. Even if this preliminary question is answered, the further question of whether an explanation solely in terms</page><page sequence="23">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 57 of forces, with no reference to signification or meaning, is or is not adequate or sufficient for psychoanalysis, would still need to be addressed. I submit that such an account is neither plausible nor adequate, and further, that it leads to difficulties in maintaining a unified theoretical foundation. If we define the boundaries of the field of psychoanalysis as Freud did, i.e., as restricted to the realm of instincts— which Freud defines as psychical representatives of organic, biological instincts but not the organic instincts themselves— then we can fairly assume that psychoanalysis addresses itself to the investigation of minds rather than brains. Of course, this does not mean that mental phenomena cannot be ex plained in terms of brain phenomena. Rather, it means that when we do so, we are doing so as, for example, neurologists and not as psychoanalysts. It can be argued that minds, unlike brains, are not simply complex physical systems in that mean ings are intrinsic to mental phenomena. Thus a comparison of a mental phenomenon to rock strata quickly becomes, as we will see, inadequate. The traces left on rocks by geological conditions are determined, in part, by the nature of rocks, such that it is not possible for such traces to take the form, for example, of sounds or odors. This does not gainsay the possibility that the geological conditions themselves might have such qualities. Similarly, when unconscious forces leave traces on the mind, the nature of such traces is, in part, determined by the nature of what is being imprinted. Even if unconscious forces simply leave traces or marks, such traces become meaningful insofar as they are mental traces. Thus, connections of signification exist along with causal connec tions from the start. It is beyond doubt that Freud presents an unconscious which is an economic system and which exerts causal influ ences upon mental phenomena. Ricoeur agrees that symp toms are, in part, merely substitute satisfactions, i.e., merely marks of unconscious wishes. The question is whether these phenomena can adequately be explained solely as effects of these causes or whether they are not rather "meaning effects," i.e., expressions and marks. It is clear that there is an eco nomic aspect to dream formation, which determines the form of the dream images. It is clear, whether or not one holds</page><page sequence="24">58 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis that the manifest dream has any relationship of signification to the latent dream thought, that the manifest dream itself can be said to contain relationships of signification. However, if the form and content of the dream is to be explained solely on the basis of causal effects of unconscious forces which as such have no meaning, how is one to explain the existence of the manifest signification? How can a pure force of desire alone be responsible for generating meanings which dream images manifestly have? If primary process is only mental billiards, if the unconscious is comprised solely of forces in teracting with one another, what import would the interpre tation of dreams, which are simply derivative of such forces, have? How could such interpretations reveal anything other than forces interacting with one another? Yet, in a footnote added in 1935 to his Autobiographical Study, Freud states: "Aristotle's old definition of the dream as mental life during sleep still holds good. There was a reason for my choosing as the title of my book not The Dream but The Interpretation of Dreams" (1925, 46). If a dream, for example, is co-determined by forces— which make the dream a sign with a non-meaningful refer ent— and by the context of intentional meanings in which it is created—which make it a symbol with reference to a net work of meanings—then the dream requires an explanation in terms of economics and hermeneutics. If one wants to explain these phenomena solely in terms of economics, then one faces the following difficulties. One ends up either having explained only part of the data, or being forced to regard the meanings of the phenomena as unimportant, accidental or epiphenomenal. If psychoanalysis is only explaining re pressed causes, then the set of associated meanings to these purportedly meaningless traces, which the practicing analyst interprets, are either left unexplained or require a separate theoretical foundation in order to be explained. Psycho analysis then would require two separate theories which would have no apparent relationship to one another. Further, if meanings are relegated solely to consciousness and sec ondary process, and the unconscious and primary process is considered to be comprised solely of forces, one is also faced with the task of explaining how, in principle, one moves be</page><page sequence="25">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 59 tween two such absolutely disparate systems. Further, the position will ultimately have to answer to the charge of epis temological dualism. Blight (1981) has cogently argued that an approach to psychoanalysis which rests on a pure her meneutics or a pure logical empiricism is ultimately forced into affirming an epistemological dualism. Ricoeur's position, on the contrary, avoids all of the dif ficulties inherent in Grunbaum's and Shope's position, as well as those inherent in a purely hermeneutic position, such as that of Schäfer (1972, 1975, 1976), Rosen (1969, 1974) or Lacan (1968, 1977). By recognizing that a mixed discourse is foundational to the theoretical, practical and methodolog ical facets of Freudian psychoanalysis, he is able to account for the presence of causal, motivational and hermeneutic explanations, to account for the presence of resistance and significance in the analytic situation and to account for the relationship between the metapsychology and the clinical the ory. As opposed to denying the presence of signification in psychoanalytic data, which require a hermeneutic explana tion, and as opposed to denying the presence of the effects of economic forces in psychoanalytic data, which require a causal explanation, Ricoeur states: Freud is correct in completely ignoring the distinction between motive and cause and in making even its the oretical formulation impossible. In many ways his ex planations refer to 'causally relevant' factors, whether this is in terms of the initial phenomenon (e.g., the origin of a neurosis), the intermediate stages (e.g., the genesis of a symptom, of a libidinal structure), itsfunction (e.g., compromise formation), or finally, its 'significance' (e.g., substitution or symbolic value). ... All that is important to him is to explain through one or another of the explanatory modes ... or through an 'overde termined' use of several of them, what in behavior are 'the incongruities' in relation to the expected course of a human agent's action. It is the attempt to reduce these 'incongruities' that forbids distinguishing between mo tives and causes because it calls for an explanation by means of causes in order to reach an understanding in</page><page sequence="26">60 Ricoeur's Contribution to Psychoanalysis terms of motives. And this is what I try to express in my own terms by saying that the facts &lt;of psychoanalysis arise both from the category of the text, and hence_of meaning, and from the categories of energy and re sistance, and hence of force. (1981, 263) Ricoeur recognizes that the Freudian unconscious is nei ther a language nor a machine, neither a consciousness nor a body, though it is related to both. With his interpretation of psychoanalysis as a mixed discourse, a semantics of desire, Ricoeur provides psychoanalysis with an epistemological foundation, a unified basis for both the metapsychology and the clinical theory, and an evidential criterion. His position provides an answer to the charge of "protoscience" while at the same time preserving what is essential to the project of psychoanalytic thought and activity. Due to the prevalence of patent misunderstandings of Ricoeur's position, the value of his contributions have largely gone unappreciated and unutilized. We have tried to clear a path for the appreciation and utilization of Ricoeur's theory, by detailing its misrepresentation by his critics. The perpet uation of such misrepresentations has been to the detriment of psychoanalytic theorizing, which both sorely needs, and recognizes the need for, an epistemological foundation that accounts for the special arena of scientific investigation which Freud delimited. 88 Allen Road Rockville Centre, NY 11570 Notes 1. The difference between Ricoeur's and Grunbaum's positions will be more easily grasped if one keeps in mind the Husserlian (Husserl 1970, 269-70) distinction between signs which have a meaning which the sign expresses, and signs which merely point to an object. Signs which merely point to an object and do not express are called "marks." Such signs and what they point to can be related in several ways, e.g., arbitrarily, by convention, as in the relation between a road sign and its message or e.g., causally, as in the relation of a footprint in the sand to the person who walked on the beach. On the other hand, signs which express, or "expressions," are related to what they express by relationships of meaning. For Ricoeur dreams are expressions of unconscious wishes. For Grun baum dreams are marks of unconscious wishes.</page><page sequence="27">Margaret Chernack Beaudoin 61 2. Hermeneutics is an essentially circular epistemology since it involves under standing something by interpreting its parts in relation to the whole. To un derstand a part of something in terms of the whole implies that there must be already some understanding of the whole which itself is to be the ultimate object of interpretation. This hermeneutic circle is not vicious as it "implies a correction based on the feedback between the preliminary understanding of the whole text and the interpretation of its parts" (Thomä and Kächele 1975, 52).
