Reviewed by ann-elise lewallen " Shirokanipe ranran pishkan. Silver droplets falling, falling all around, golden droplets falling, falling all around. Singing this song I came down, following the river's flow" (197). And thus begins the melodic Ainu Shin yôshû as recorded by Chiri Yukie. Sarah Strong's monograph, Ainu Spirits Singing , reinvigorates a long-neglected analysis of indigenous Ainu literature, and breaks a silence of more than thirty years since any sustained Anglophone engagement with the subject. Ainu oral literary genres are highly regarded among indigenous oral traditions the world over and have been compared with Greek epics for their expressive depth and extensive range. Further, Strong offers an important counterpoint to earlier analysis by centering her study on the much-revered Chiri Yukie (1903-1922), the first Ainu identified person to translate this literature into Japanese and share the bounty of Ainu oral expression with a broader Japanese audience. This volume represents a timely and invaluable contribution to understandings of Ainu literature and to indigenous and world literature more broadly. After nearly 30 years of international and domestic campaigns, Ainu were recognized as Japan's indigenous peoples in 2008. This text emphasizes an approach to recorded memory practiced historically: Ainu communities did not conventionally record their histories in written form, but chronicled important social changes orally. Strong eschews an extended discussion of whether or not indigenous oral literary forms - formerly classed as folklore by some scholars - constitute literature. Instead, following scholar of oral cultures Walter Ong, she suggests that today's kamui yukar portray the evolution of Ainu</page><page sequence="2">48 Japanese Language and Literature chants from the pre-seventeenth through the early twentieth centuries when the chants were initially recorded (47). Thought to be of greatest antiquity among Ainu oral performance styles, the kamui yukar represent one strand of a rich tradition of Ainu literary forms, many now being revived under the present wave of Ainu cultural revival. Since state-mandated colonization in 1 869 oral literature has been sculpted by the chronicles kept by Ainu bards. Ainu literature may be roughly divided into two main genres: those presented in spoken prose without cadence and those delivered in a metered form (6-7). Narrative styles delivered in spoken form include uepeker (stories of both humans and non-humans) and pon upashkuma (narratives containing life skill lessons). Meanwhile, the metered genres include heroic epics known as yukar , featuring human actors, as well as kamui yukar and oina, highlighting the adventures of spiritual beings or partially human actors. Traditionally recited by men, yukar describe historical and mythological events, and address the non-human world inhabited by spiritual beings and interrelations between humans and spiritual beings. A second genre, kamui yukar , are narrated by the animal-hero in first person, but may focus on plants, natural phenomena such as fire, water, lightning or thunder. Stylistic features of kamui yukar include the use of a sakehe (refrain), mimicking an animal voice or characteristic movement, and always include the ritualized first-person ending, "as told by the kamui him/her-self' (205). Unlike other oral genres, kamui yukar are recited primarily by women and Ainu linguist Kindaichi Kyõsuke has suggested these narratives stem from the trances of female shamans (7). As such the deeper implications of Chiri's work to collate the thirteen chants translated into English here may be better appreciated. In chapter one, Strong discusses the biography of Chiri Yukie, born to a Horobetsu Ainu family in southern Hokkaido. Chiri resided with her aunt Kannari Matsu and grandmother Monashnouk, both retaining extensive knowledge of the Ainu oral tradition. Kannari, well trained in written Japanese and in the Latin alphabet through her mission school upbringing, likely influenced Chiri's choice to use the Latin alphabet to transcribe Ainu phonetically. Steeped in the traditions of her ancestors and ranked highly in majority Japanese schools despite being a minority, Chiri straddled two worlds. She was bilingual and bicultural and thus attractive to philologist Kindaichi who met her in 1918. Chronicling her heritage in written form, Kindaichi sought to convince Chiri, would serve</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 49 as a treasure for humanity and future generations of scholars. Chiri, for her part, envisioned herself as working for "the ancestors of [her] people" but believed the benefits would extend beyond Japan to "all the countries of the world" (32). Between 1920-1922, she transcribed several notebooks sampling a range of Ainu literary traditions and sent them to Kindaichi. And despite suffering from congenital heart disease, Chiri accepted Kindaichi' s exhortations to spend the summer of 1922 in his Tokyo home. Tragically, the sweltering weather and excessive demands placed on her in the Kindaichi household overburdened her weakened body, and Chiri died of heart failure in mid-September. Although Chiri and her family were among few remaining heritage speakers of Horobetsu dialect Ainu language, today Ainu language is undergoing a broad revival, including a thriving language class in Noboribetsu. Strong's second chapter fleshes out the physical topography and natural history of coastal southwestern Hokkaido to situate readers in the world from which kamui yukar emerged. She also acknowledges that these spaces and the animal heroes they enfold stem from the pre- colonial era, memories inscribed in a pre-seventeenth century topography prior to changes such as compulsory labor, resettlement, and industrialization indelibly shifted human relations with their kamui (spiritual beings) interlocutors. Here readers learn of the impacts of colonization in truncating Ainu access to kamui and key sources of protein such as whales, salmon, and deer; and critical shifts in the ecological balance such as the disappearance of certain spiritual beings like the river otter and the loss of plant habitats to development which have radically impacted Ainu livelihood in the interim. Chapter three provides a cultural framework of the Ainu social landscape to illustrate how human beings engaged in animistic relations with kamui of the surrounding environment. Ainu settlements, for example, are constituted by the human dwellers together with the adjacent iwor (hunting, gathering, and fishing grounds) regions where Ainu obtained foodstuffs, clothing, and materials for shelter. To ensure reciprocal relations with these various kamui , Ainu men carried out regular ceremonies at external household altars, conveying their prayers and gratitude to the kamui of the surrounding environment. Chapters four and five examine three separate categories of spiritual beings who populate Chiri' s kamui yukar : those beings defined as "weighty," or powerful, who may also serve as "symbolic spiritual beings"; those defined as "of lighter weight," named primarily by</page><page sequence="4">50 Japanese Language and Literature location of residence; and the least powerful group who are labeled according to their characteristic nature and behaviors (72, 139). A further note on animal kamui is their nature as shape-shifters: when appearing in the human world they assume the morphology of animals, yet back in their home environments they appear essentially in anthropomorphic form as human beings (109). These chapters provide a thumbnail sketch of the biological features of each species, discussion of how they were (and are) imagined and represented in the Ainu historical imagination, and a close reading of each narrative providing context for interpreting the shin ' yöshü . These latter chapters serve as guideposts illuminating the cultural framework for the climax of the book, Strong's translations of the Ainu Shin 'yöshü, published after Chiri's death. Strong's monograph is the first to place Ainu Shin 'yöshü in its cultural, historical, and spiritual contexts for an Anglophone readership. In the preface to Ainu Shin 'yöshü, Chiri includes a nostalgic passage describing an unfathomably peaceful and vast natural landscape where her ancestors thrived. At the close of this passage she mourns, "But that is now a thing of the past; the dream was ruptured decades ago" (195). Strong's careful analysis of the preface in chapter one helps contextualize this imagined pre-colonial era, pointing out that challenges such as intra-Ainu warfare, contagions introduced by colonizers, lopsided trading relations between Ainu and Japanese, starvation resulting from shifts in animal population and pressure on these animals due to their commoditization, are selectively ignored in this romanticized vision of erstwhile Ainu life (34). She also assesses Chiri's personal grief at the loss of her Ainu brethren and assesses the pervasive ideology of Ainu as a "dying race," widespread in the early twentieth century: "we are a pitiful sight. A dying people.... That is our name" (195). Responding to Chiri's lament in the preface, Strong introduces historical analysis of Ainu population shifts, noting that the population did not actually fluctuate significantly from the 1850s to the 1920s. Alternately, I submit that the authority of the "dying race" theory here, stemming from twin theories of eugenics and social evolution and emerging from the early twentieth century embrace of scientific modernity, might be more productively assessed for its discursive impact on Japanese society and by extension, on Ainu society. After all, the terrifying power of the genocidal suggestion evoked by the "dying race" ideology lay not in its veracity, but rather in the suggestion that Ainu were faced with few alternatives: they must either assimilate to majority Japanese cultural</page><page sequence="5">Reviews 5 1 standards or face abandonment by modernity to fester in uncivilized backwardness. One final concern is less specifically directed at Strong's contribution and underscores the predicament of trying to appraise indigenous traditions in the context of postcolonial modernity with the syncretic value systems of living indigenous communities. In her preface to the book, Strong thoughtfully addresses the complex postcolonial reality of Ainu whose lives varied little from their ethnic Japanese contemporaries (xiii). She signals her intent to differentiate certain material culture practices through use of the past tense to distinguish them from intangibles such as religious beliefs and ethical values to be described in the present tense. The concern here is beyond grammar or semantics. Even with a disclaimer and Strong's caution that not all Ainu "think alike"; the distinction between present and past tense, or living traditions and those of some antiquity, merits greater nuance. At present Ainu-identified material culture practitioners across Japan are engaged in a thriving cultural revival. At the same time, not all Ainu-identified persons necessarily subscribe to the blend of Ainu cosmology or ethics reflected in the kamui yukar. Extensive usage of the past tense in chapters two through five highlighting Ainu relations with spiritual beings conveys the mistaken impression that neither these animal beings nor their message are a part of Ainu lives. Alternately, Strong's suggestion that many Ainu continue to honor ancestors through ritual offerings at an outside altar or fear the outcome should they utter a taboo word while at sea, does not accord with urban Ainu lives. These suggestions may risk implying that most living Ainu embrace an ultra- conservative cosmology, seeking to mimic ancestral ways as precisely as possible. On the contrary, the majority of the contemporary Ainu population would prefer to remain anonymous, and reject association with the remainder of the Ainu community in part due to a painful legacy of assimilation and racial discrimination. While Strong seeks to acknowledge these incongruities in her preface, the text itself seemed to linger too long on images of a pristine, pre-colonial golden era, a magical era Chiri herself romanticized in her preface (195-196). The quandary of how best to assess a worldview woven together from memory, oral literary traditions, and fragments of living practice passed down, to accurately reflect the contemporary realities of living indigenous peoples, presents a genuine dilemma. The gift of Strong's contribution is to initiate a conversation on the vast unwritten heritage of</page><page sequence="6">52 Japanese Language and Literature indigenous peoples, now trickling despite its earlier prominence as a "fluid river of tales" (4). For those indigenous communities of greater familiarity in Anglophone literature - Australian Aborigines with their storehouses of Dreamtime narratives, for example - the issue of acknowledging continuous survival is perhaps less urgent, in part because they occupy a more complex topography in the popular imagination. In this sense, the biography of Chiri and her ancestors' heritage advances a critical conversation for literary scholars of Japan and pushes future scholarship to broaden this beyond the contours of nation to global indigenous literatures.</page></plain_text>
