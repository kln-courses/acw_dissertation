         <title>Introductory Remarks<sup>1</sup>
         </title>
         <p>Determining the world outlook and mystic-fatalistic contemplations of the ancient inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula<sup>2</sup> is in some sense equivalent to the objective of the present paper which deals with perceptions of time, fate, and predestination, as well as practices of prediction and beliefs in Divine Judgment executed both in the Next World and in earthly life. The study is focused on four main models of fate (as time, spinner [<italic>manāyā</italic>], text, and judge), their anthropomorphic imageries and metamorphoses in Jāhiliyya poetry, and examines the divinations by observing the signs of Fate, i.e., in elaborating the following five problems, which were closely interrelated and interdependent.</p>
         <p>The first of these elaborations is the lexicological repository of the concept of fate, its language and terminologies. The second section looks at four models of fate: the Zurvanite God of time and the Arabian concept of <italic>dahr</italic>, fate-as-time and the notion of a heavenly clock; the Greek Moirai and the Arabian rope of fate (fate-as-spinner); the belief in the Divine Decree (fate-as-text); and the belief in Divine Judgment and its practice in earthly life (fate-as-judge). The third study is of imagery and portraits of fate, of anthropo- / theriomorphic images of fate in pre-Islamic poetry, and of prophylactic arms and guards against anthropomorphic forms of fate. Fourth, I turn to divination and the signs of fate, addressing Muslim hagiography on <italic>kāhin</italic> practices and the use of visual surroundings as a tool of prediction. Fifth and finally, I will look at determinations of fate and the individual setting of goals.</p>
         <p>Pre-Islamic Arabs did not have philosophical treatises like the Greeks, and few written records shed light on their mythological-religious notions, mystic speculations, or occult sciences. Nevertheless, one can find allusions to them in pre-Islamic poetry, and some records in Muslim sources reflect the unique outlook of Jāhiliyya man, which was formed by “the ships and caravans which brought to Arabia not merely merchandise and people, but books, ideas and religious doctrines,”<sup>3</sup> at the same time reflecting the peculiarities of the Arabian <italic>mentalité</italic> and desert life. According to Clair Tisdall, “The people of Arabia were to some degree affected by the civilization of . . . foreign nations, their trade and their ideas in general, but the influence of the religion also must have been considerable.”<sup>4</sup> The country was a hideout for persecuted Christians and Jews from the Roman Empire and hermits of various sects who debated with each other (Q. 19:37) and propagated their teachings in the steppes and oases of Arabia.<sup>5</sup> Therefore, as Suzanne Stetkevych has written, <disp-quote>
               <p>. . . the pre-Islamic era saw the formation of the rich cultural and literary traditions upon which the new religion and civilization of Islam were founded. It was during this period that an autochthonous Arab Semitic culture, rooted in the civilizational bedrock of the Ancient Near East and the residues of the Hellenistic age, and subject to Christian and Judaic, Byzantine, and Persian influences, developed as its preeminent form of expression the classical Arabic ode, or <italic>qaṣīda</italic> (<italic>qaṣīdah</italic>).<sup>6</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Due to the dreadfulness of desert life, where spirits and ghosts abounded amid the perils of famine and disaster; the unceasing tribal wars that, “like a millstone, ground [the] people”;<sup>7</sup> distressing uncertainty about the future; and frequent unexpected death; the inhabitants of the Arabian Peninsula were inclined to meditations on so-called “accursed” questions about time, fate, and human life. Desperate attempts were made to discern the signs of fate and foretell reverses of fortune. All these meditations and speculations are mirrored clearly in Arabian literary tradition, particularly in Jāhiliyya poetry, which is commonly called <italic>dīwān al-ʿArab</italic> (a register of the Arabs). Betsi Shidfar has stated that such questions of existence in Arabian poetry were related to pre-Semitic and Semitic mythology, as well as to traditions of preceding civilizations, and reflected the characteristics of philosophical or ethical poetry that subsequently found further development in the genre of <italic>zuhdiyyāt</italic>. Pre-Islamic poetry elaborated philosophical lyrics on characteristics, such as the purpose of life, the inevitability of death, feebleness against omnipotent fate, memories of past generations, and the establishment of strict principles of morality.<sup>8</sup>

         <title>The Language of Fate</title>
         <p>The reconstruction of a perception of fate and the determination of its position in everyday consciousness first requires an analysis of the language of fate. This reveals itself through the etymological dimensions of the relevant vocabulary, its archetypal roots, associative horizons, and mythopoeic images.<sup>9</sup> In most cases the vocabulary related to fate is associated also with the concept of time. ‘Abd al-Ilāh al-Ṣā’igh,while analyzing this concept in pre-Islamic Arabia, distinguished between time in its direct meaning (<italic>zamān—waqt</italic>) and as a symbol of life and death (<italic>zamān—rumūz al-ḥayāt wa-l-mawt</italic>).<sup>10</sup> According to T. Noldeke, although time is often rendered by references to fate in pre-Islamic poetry, this treatment is not quite correct: he explained further by saying that time was here conceived as the determining factor, not itself determined by some other power, least of all by a conscious agent.<sup>11</sup> In spite of this conceptual difference, in pre-Islamic Arabia, time and fate were closely bound, as demonstrated by the abundance of relevant terms with dual meaning, such as <italic>dahr</italic>, <italic>zamān</italic>, <italic>ayyām</italic>, <italic>layāl</italic>, and <italic>ḥīn</italic>, to which ancient Arabian poets frequently appealed for expressing reversals of fortune.</p>
         <p>The most employed word is <italic>dahr</italic>. By the testimony of the medieval Arab lexicologist Ibn Manẓūr (d. 1311), <italic>dahr</italic> means <italic>al-amad al-mamdūd</italic> (a long period, such as a thousand years).<sup>12</sup> While explaining the meaning of this word, almost all Arab lexicographers quote the <italic>ḥadīth</italic> of the Prophet Muḥammad:<sup>13</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>لا تسبّوا الدهر فإن الله هو الدهر</p>
               <p>Do not curse time (<italic>dahr</italic>), Allah is time.</p>
            </disp-quote> As Isma‘īl al-Jawharī (d. 1003) noticed, people commonly ascribed their misfortunes to <italic>dahr</italic>. In the <italic>ḥadīth</italic>, they are told not to curse the actor (<italic>fāʿil</italic>) of misfortunes, because Allah causes all things.<sup>14</sup> Another definition given to <italic>dahr</italic> is <italic>nāzila</italic> (mischief from the heavens). Sometimes, Jāhiliyya Arabs used <italic>dahārīr</italic> (misfortunes) to emphasize the meaning of <italic>dahr</italic>. The ancient Arabian seer Saṭīḥ said:<sup>15</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>فإنّ هذا الدهرَ اطواراً دهارير</p>
               <p>The time (<italic>dahr</italic>) sometimes is misfortune (<italic>dahārīr</italic>).</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Definitions colored by social attitudes are reflected in the meanings of <italic>leyl</italic> or <italic>leylā</italic> (night) and <italic>yawm</italic> (day). According to Ibn Manẓūr, <italic>layl</italic> means hardship and suffering, and <italic>leylā</italic> is the longest and hardest night. The female name Leylā traces back to this implication.<sup>16</sup> Etiological myths paint pictures beyond the words of <italic>leyl</italic> and <italic>nahār</italic> (daytime); Ibn Manẓūr explained that for some people, <italic>leyl</italic> was the child of a curlew (<italic>karawān</italic>), and <italic>nahār</italic> was the child of a bustard (<italic>ḥubāra</italic>).<sup>17</sup> A weak person was called Abū Leylā by some in the Quraysh tribe. While <italic>leyl</italic> expresses misfortunes and hardships, <italic>yawm</italic> appears to have two opposite (<italic>muḍādd</italic>) meanings. In some Qur’anic verses, y<italic>awm</italic> is explained as both God’s punishment and His blessings.<sup>18</sup> According to al-Ṣā’igh, such enantiosemia is owed to day’s consisting of <italic>nahār</italic> (daytime) and <italic>leyl</italic> (nighttime). Ancient Arabs considered the night to be the beginning of the day, because nights give birth to days; in their view, the day begins and ends with the sunset.<sup>19</sup> Therefore, the static night was considered to be feminine (a pregnant woman), while the dynamic day, masculine.</p>
         <p>What about <italic>manāyā</italic>, the plural of <italic>maniyya</italic> (destiny, death)? Ibn Manẓūr related it to the fate of death (<italic>qadar al-mawt</italic>). Abū Dhu’ayb (d.c. 29/ 650) said:<sup>20</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>منايا يقربن الختوف لاهلها</p>
               <p>Destinies bring deaths closer to the people.</p>
            </disp-quote> 
            <italic>Manāyā</italic> is derived from the root <italic>m-n-y</italic>, which means to predestinate.<sup>21</sup> Noldeke has explained further: <disp-quote>
               <p>There is also a rarely used synonymous form <italic>manūn</italic> which is derived from the cognate root <italic>m-n-n</italic>. The same etymological group includes the ancient Meni (Is. 65–11), perhaps a Canaanite deity, and also the great goddess Manāt, who figures in the Qur’an and which in Nabatean and Latin inscriptions is mentioned in the plural form Manāwāt, just as the plural <italic>Manāyā</italic>.<sup>22</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> And Manāt was seemingly not the only idol connected with time-as-fate: <disp-quote>
               <p>There exists in Arabia a rare word for ‘time’, namely, ‘auḍ’. A poet who belonged to the tribe of Bakr b. Wā’il in the North East of Arabia, says in describing his old age: ‘The arrows of ‘Auḍ have pierced my limbs and joints.’ . . . an isolated verse not infrequently quoted, contains the phrase ‘I swear by the blood (of the sacrifices) that flows round ‘Auḍ’;<sup>23</sup> here ‘Auḍ ‘time’, ‘fate’ appears as a real deity, with a regular cult, and ibn al-Kalbī expressly states that ‘Auḍ was an idol worshipped by the Banū Bakr b. Wā’il, the very tribe of which the aforesaid poet was a member.<sup>24</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Suzanne P. Stetkevych has offered interesting lexicological observations on notions closely related to time-as-fate, such as permanence and impermanence, or immortality and mortality, as they appear through the opening parts of pre-Islamic odes. In an analysis of Labīd b. Rabī‘a’s (d. 41/661) <italic>muʿallaqa</italic>, Stetkevych discussed the depiction of the abandoned and ruined abodes (<italic>al-aṭlāl</italic>): <disp-quote>
               <p>What society, culture had created—both temporary and permanent encampments—nature has erased; what was one settled, cultivated, is now grown wild (<italic>ta’abbada</italic>). Essential to this dialectic is the ephemeral and transitory quality of all that is cultural or cultivated—that is, human—as opposed to the permanence and perpetuity of eternity. <italic>Ta’abbada</italic>, to become wild, derives from the root <italic>’-b-d</italic>, which means to become wild, unsocial (<italic>’abada/u</italic>), but also to last, to remain, to dwell permanently, as in <italic>’abad</italic>, lasting, everlasting, eternity (<italic>’abada/i</italic>). Thus <italic>ta’bbada</italic> also conveys at some level the sense of perpetuity or eternity. Its opposite <italic>ta’annasa</italic>, to be sociable, is from <italic>’-n-s</italic>, a root meaning to be social, sociable tame, hence <italic>’ins</italic>, mankind.<sup>25</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Continuing this motif, Stetkevych has said that even the word used for years (<italic>ḥijaj</italic>) is specifically cultural and ritual; it is literally <italic>ḥajjes</italic> (pilgrimages), or the span of time between one pilgrimage and the next, time as measured by human ritual, not natural phenomena. The human vernal encampments were abandoned and ruined, but the mountains, stars, and fortresses did not vanish.<sup>26</sup> While in Labīd’s poetry, immortality is aligned with the mountains and stars,<sup>27</sup> Arabic poetry features other passages in which natural phenomena surrender to <italic>dahr</italic>. In a poem by Imru’ al-Qays’ (d.c. 550), fate is ruthless with even high rocks: <disp-quote>
               <p>ارجي من صروف الدهر لينا         ولم تغفل عن الصم الهضاب</p>
               <p>I ask the vicissitudes of fate for mercy, but they do not spare even the high rock.<sup>28</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> ‘Adī b. Zayd (d.c. 587) showed fate as equally powerful against massive mountains:<sup>29</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>وخطوب الدهر لا يبقى لها         ولما تأتي به صم الجبال</p>
               <p>Even massive mountains vanish in the face of the vicissitudes of fate.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Such diversity in poetry from representatives of the same literary tradition was likely called forth by the changeable atmosphere of both social and natural instability. On the other hand, these poets may be using an embellishment common in Arabic poetry, <italic>ifrāṭ fī-l-ṣifa</italic> (exaggeration in depiction), to portray the might of <italic>dahr</italic> more effectively. Such power produced another chain of metaphors; <italic>dahr</italic> itself, the most powerful and omnipotent image, was employed to depict human beings and kings—and even the beloved, who was as changeable as the time.<sup>30</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Alongside the negative vocabulary of fate, some dictionaries included words with arguably positive meanings. <italic>al-Ṣiḥāḥ</italic> and <italic>Lisān al-ʿArab</italic> define the synonymous words <italic>jadd</italic>, <italic>ḥaẓẓ</italic>, and <italic>naṣīb</italic>
            <sup>31</sup> as ‘fortune’ or ‘good luck.’ Notably <italic>naṣīb</italic> first means ‘portion’ or ‘lot,’ which evokes ideas about the divider of portions, just like the Greek Moira Lachesis, disposer of lots.</p>
         <p>What about signs of fate and divinations? It is worth noting that there is no term for the art of foretelling derived from the roots of <italic>dahr</italic>, <italic>manāyā</italic>, <italic>zamān</italic>, or <italic>qadar</italic>. The lexicological repository of these words is mainly connected to the subject of divination as <italic>takahhana</italic> (<italic>kāhin</italic>), <italic>tanabba’</italic> (<italic>nabī</italic>), or <italic>qayyafa</italic> (<italic>qayyāf</italic>); to the element of divination (<italic>taṭayyur</italic>, <italic>khaṭṭ al-raml</italic>); or to the expressed character of divination (<italic>tafā’ala</italic>, <italic>tashā’ama</italic>).</p>

            <title>Fate-as-time: Zoroastrian-Zurvanite Time and Arabic <italic>Dahr</italic>
            </title>
            <p>The noted scholar I. Y. Kratchkovsky has stated that any foreign influence observed in the development of Arabic sciences and humanities comes from two directions—from the Sasanian-Persian and Greek-Byzantine worlds.<sup>32</sup> Since the conception of time-as-fate constitutes an important portion of the world outlook of the ancient Arabs, it would be appropriate here to draw parallels with Persian and Byzantine mythic-religious and spiritual systems. Of particular interest is the reflection of Zoroastrian (and related Zurvanite and Mithraic) ideas on time-as-fate in ancient Arabian perceptions. Comparisons between the Arabic and Zoroastrian concepts of time tend not to imply identity but indicate transformations caused by specific Arabian surroundings.</p>
            <p>There is a prophetic tradition that says, “<italic>Qadriyya majūs hādhihi-l-umma</italic>” (“The Qadriyya are the magi of this religion”). In the relevant literature, this saying refers to the sectarian Qadriyya, who appeared in the late Umayyad period and claimed a doctrine of free will in Islam.<sup>33</sup> There were conceptual differences between Zoroastrianism and its heterodox, Zurvanite movement with regard to the doctrine of time-as-fate and free will. Abraham Jackson has stated that, according to the whole tenor of Zoroastrianism, there was no foreordination; in Zoroastrianism, <disp-quote>
                  <p>God has created man as a free agent, endowed with the power to choose, of his own volition, between that which is right and that which is wrong. Upon his choice, however, his own salvation and his share in the ultimate victory of good will depend. . . . Responsibility accordingly rests upon man, and, because of his freedom of choice, he will be held to strict accountability hereafter.<sup>34</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Within Zoroastrianism, the Zurvanite doctrine that emerged and its God of time Zurvān obscured the concept of free will by claiming absolute predominance of time-as-fate.<sup>35</sup> Zurvān was primarily “he who makes virile, he who makes excellent, and he who makes old. As such, he is the god of life and death, presiding over the birth, maturity, and death of the body.”<sup>36</sup> Since this image of Zurvān bears a strong resemblance to the ancient Arab perception of time-as-fate, the above-cited prophetic tradition very likely implies that Zurvanite ideas spread among the Arabs during the lifetime of the prophet more thoroughly than Zoroastrian free will in the late Umayyad period. Note that <italic>qadar</italic> itself means <italic>qaḍā’</italic> and <italic>ḥukm</italic> (fate, God’s judgment),<sup>37</sup> terms which were closer to ideas of fatalism than to the sect of free will in the Umayyad period. In the Qur’an, the concept of time represents the fatalistic speculations of ancient Arabs, who appear to attribute an overwhelming, enigmatic power to time, ascribing to it all their misfortunes: “And they say: ‘What is there but our life in this world? We shall die and we live, and nothing but time (<italic>dahr</italic>) can destroy us.’” (Q. 45:24, trans. Yūsuf ‘Alī.)</p>
            <p>Ancient Arabic anthropomorphic images of time-as-fate, one of the most commonly applied metaphors in pre-Islamic poetry, are very similar to images of Zurvān, the god of fate and infinite time.<sup>38</sup> is Gerhard Böwering has indicated that the general term for time in Arabic translations from Pahlavi is <italic>zamān</italic>, which corresponds to Zurvān, a deity who is the father to twins: “‘luminous and perfumed’ Ohrmazd and ‘dark and malodorous’ Ahriman.”<sup>39</sup> Strong evidence points to a close relationship between the ancient Arabs and Persians<sup>40</sup> during a period when Zurvānism was gaining favor among influential Persians such as the royal families of the Ahamenids and Sasanids.<sup>41</sup> On the other hand, Zurvānism was especially widespread in the Western regions of Iran, closer to Arabia. After assessing Iranian influence on ancient Arabia, we can perceive that Zoroastrian ideas appear in worship and beliefs related to fire in pre-Islamic society, while Zurvanite impact reveals itself in ancient Arabian concepts of time-as-fate.</p>
            <p>Pre-Islamic Arabs believed in an abstract power called <italic>dahr</italic> or <italic>manāyā</italic>. According to portraits of this power in pre-Islamic poetry, they were far from revering it as divine; yet historical records do offer traces of such worship.<sup>42</sup> Due to mortal fear of desert life, sudden misfortune, and uncertainty for the future, they imagined this power in their poetry as “a hostile watchman and ruiner of human lives.”<sup>43</sup> In contrast to Zurvanite ideas, which represented both positive and negative sides and considered time first of all a constructor and creator, Arabs depicted it negatively, with dark colors and as a hostile spirit; as Emil Homerin wrote: <disp-quote>
                  <p>
                     <italic>Dahr</italic> (time-as-fate) or <italic>maniyah</italic> (fate-as-destiny) was the tyrannical sovereign, unpredictable and capricious, which set the appointed time (<italic>ajal</italic>) for every man’s death. Grudgingly, fate drove man into misfortune, separating him from his loved ones, acting treacherously, corrupting and destroying all what he cared for.<sup>44</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote> It is no wonder that pre-Islamic Arabs frequently abused and insulted <italic>dahr</italic>. The prophetic tradition, “Do not abuse time (<italic>dahr</italic>), Allah is time” may indicate the ancient Arabs’ sometimes rude and disrespectful attitude towards their deities on the eve of Islam. Seemingly the religious crisis about idolatry caused them to abuse their deities and idols,<sup>45</sup> particularly the <italic>dahr</italic>, to whom they ascribed all their misfortunes.</p>
            <p>Naturally, the pre-Islamic Arabs’ perception of time was deeply astrological.<sup>46</sup> Constant nighttime travel guided by the Moon and stars cultivated their attention. As Abd al-Ilāh al-Ṣā’igh stated, “The heavens were the greatest clock for Arabs.”<sup>47</sup> The rising and setting of the celestial bodies determined the time. The northern Arabian tribes utilized a solar calendar, while the southern tribes also determined time by lunar and stellar calendars.<sup>48</sup> Jāhiliyya Arabs became especially intimate with the Moon. They observed the changeable character of the Moon in accordance with the constellations and determined twenty-eight phases of the Moon (<italic>manāzil al-qamar</italic>), which corresponded to the notion of <italic>naw’</italic> (<italic>’anwā</italic>).<sup>49</sup> Each <italic>naw’</italic> had its own name and characteristics. According to Muslim tradition, <italic>naw’</italic> was one of the three sciences in which ancient Arabs were well-read.<sup>50</sup> Even the Arabic alphabet maintained traces of ancient Arabian astrological views.<sup>51</sup> Veneration of numbers such as seven, four, and three were also connected with celestial bodies.</p>
            <p>Ancient Arabian poetry, as a faithful mirror, reflected these notions. The personification of the Moon is observed in Jāhiliyya poetry in a poem attributed to Ḥassān al-Sa‘dī, in which the phases of the Moon are compared to periods of human life from childhood to senility.<sup>52</sup> Very likely, there was a belief that each person had a star, and when the person died, his star disappearsed:<sup>53</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>ا لم تر لقمان بن عاد تتابعت    عليه النسور ثم غابت كواكبه</p>
                  <p>Do not you see that Luqmān ibn ‘Ād lived as long as the vultures, then his stars faded away?</p>
               </disp-quote> Similarly, Ta’abbaṭa Sharran (d. ca. 95 <sc>bh</sc> / <sc>ad</sc> 530) felt that he was guided by the Milky Way,<sup>54</sup> and ‘Abīd b. al-Abraṣ (d. 24 <sc>bh</sc> / <sc>ad</sc> 598) mentioned “the Pleiades . . . bringing evil fortune and good.”<sup>55</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>فالشمس طالعة وليل كاسف         والنجم تجرى انحسا وسعودا</p>
                  <p>And the Sun shall rise, and the night shall eclipse it, And the Pleiades shall circle bringing evil fortune and good.<sup>56</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote> Later in Muslim tradition, a personification of the months is observed, which, according to Yevgeniy Bertels, derived inspiration from Zoroastrian mythology, in which each month and day had a patron among the spiritual powers, frequently represented in human appearance.<sup>57</sup>

            <title>Fate-as-spinner: Greek Moiras and Arabic <italic>Manāyā</italic>
            </title>
            <p>Ancient Arabian ideas of fate were not limited to the abstract <italic>dahr</italic>. One idol, Manāt, deity of Fate, is mentioned in the Qur’an (<italic>Manāt al-Thālitha al-Ukhrā</italic>, 53:20) and was revered by Arabs, particularly by the Aws and Khazraj tribes and the Qurayshites until the emergence of Islam. The worshippers made sacrifices to Manāt<sup>58</sup> and had their own family idols of Manāt in their homes.<sup>59</sup> Manāt was very similar to the Greek Moirai and Roman Parcai—the goddesses of fate. She was an icon of <italic>manāyā</italic>, which embodied the archaic deity of destiny, and, according to ancient beliefs, visited the dying man,<sup>60</sup> or as Abū Dhu’ayb said, “brings deaths closer to the people.”<sup>61</sup> This concept differed from <italic>dahr</italic>, for it referred, according to Mikhail Piotrovskiy, to individual fate, or “preordained death for each individual,” while <italic>dahr</italic> or <italic>zamān</italic> signified universal fate, or the “impersonal fate of all humankind.”<sup>62</sup> Sells characterizes <italic>dahr</italic> as fate-as-time that “changes and wears down all things,” while <italic>manāyā</italic> is a fate-allotted death.<sup>63</sup> Langdon’s observation that <italic>manāyā</italic> is derived from a common Semitic root accentuates its meanings in Hebrew, Aramaic, and Syriac as a portion or part,<sup>64</sup> implying individual fate has a determined portion for each person.<sup>65</sup>
            </p>
            <p>In the poetry discussed here, these words are mainly used as synonyms; nevertheless, a motif of individualization is clearly seen when <italic>manāyā</italic> is connected with the archetype of the thread that ties man with death. Again, parallels may be drawn with the Greek Moirai—the three goddesses of fate, daughters of the goddess Ananke who turns the cosmic spindle. The Moirai personified the inescapable destiny of each individual and spun, measured, and cut the thread of life. They were popular figures of cult worship with sanctuaries where people made offerings and sacrifices at festival times in places like Athens, Delphi, Olympia, and Sicyon.<sup>66</sup> The negative function of <italic>manāyā</italic>, meaning death, also coincides with Greek mythology and may be explained by Jack Lawson’s insightful hypothesis: <disp-quote>
                  <p>How is it that Moira came to be synonymous with death and ruin? . . . What would be more natural than the power of deity responsible for death should also be responsible for the allotted period of life? Indeed this is actually the case, for on the plural we find that the Moirai are present at a person’s birth. They are present as goddesses of fate; and in this capacity they, as it were, receive the newborn child and become masters of his destiny until he dies . . . according to the familiar and, no doubt, ancient notion that the Moirai “spin” the fate for each newborn child, this means that the end is spun from the beginning. . . . Thus it can be seen that the association of Moira or the Moirai with the death is unavoidable. One can only assume that the chthonic and negative image came about in reaction to the necessary end to all things living.<sup>67</sup>

               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>This aspect of the fate-as-spinner as unavoidable death appears in pre-Islamic poetry mainly by the archetype of rope (as a noose, bridle, or snare). As with the Greek Moirai, the Arabic <italic>manāyā</italic> are also synonymous with death and ruin; they snare people with the ropes of death. In contrast to their Greek counterparts, <italic>manāyā</italic> are not present at a person’s birth, and again, the negative function of the borrowed image prevails over the positive. Depicting the inevitability of this annihilation, Ṭarafa b. al-‘Abd (d.c. 55/570) stressed that human beings are linked to Death by the rope:<sup>68</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>لعمرك ان الموت ما اخطأ الفتى              لكالطول المرخى وثنياه باليد</p>
                  <p>اذا شاء يوما قاده بزمامه                      ومن يكن في حبل المنية يفقد</p>
                  <p>I swear by your life that Death never failed to murder the brave one.</p>
                  <p>He holds well the rope’s end in his arms.</p>
                  <p>Death will catch a man when he wants with the bridle,</p>
                  <p>He who is tied to the ropes of Death is annihilated.</p>
               </disp-quote> Following the same motif, ‘Abīd b. al-Abraṣ stressed another function of <italic>manāyā</italic>, placing them closer to the Greek Moirai; in the following passage, <italic>manāyā</italic> are connected with destiny represented as portioned or numbered days:<sup>69</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>للمرء ايام تعد وقد رعت     حبال المنايا للفتى كل مرصد</p>
                  <p>فمن لم يمت في اليوم لا بد انه     سيعلقه حبل المنية في غد</p>
                  <p>The days of man are numbered to him, and through them all,</p>
                  <p>The snares of Death lurk by the warrior as he travels perilous ways.</p>
                  <p>And he who dies not today, yet surely his fate it is,</p>
                  <p>Tomorrow to be ensnared in the nooses, his fate it is.<sup>70</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote> By making idols to this ruthless death/fate who ensnares people and cuts their rope of life, they hoped to elicit its pity by making offerings. Further, some of their talismans and amulets relate to the archetype of rope, which are detailed below.</p>
            <p>Concluding this section, I would like once more to note that Manāt was not the only idol of this kind. Another goddess noted by Noldeke was ‘Awḍ (Time).<sup>71</sup> The idol Sa‘d (Fortune) also embodied an abstract concept of fate.<sup>72</sup>

            <title>Fate-as-text: Divine Decree and Eternal Writing</title>
            <p>In spite of being a purely abstract concept, fate accomplishes its function by performing certain acts. Part of fate’s activity is connected with the sphere of predetermination, including functions like spinning, writing down destinies, and dividing out parcels of destiny. Another part of fate’s activity is related to controlling the plan for each individual, cutting the metaphorical thread of life, bringing death, and judging people for their deeds. In pre-Islamic tradition, the main model for fate revolves around the accomplishments of the determined destinies. Nevertheless, the function of the fate-as-pre-determinator is also reflected by the model of fate-as-text. The following distich by al-Nābigha al-Dhubyānī (d. <sc>ad</sc> 604) testifies that pre-Islamic Arabs had some idea about the model of fate-as-text, i.e., written divine predestination.<sup>73</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>أني وجدت سهام الموت معرضة       بكل  حتف  من  آجال  مكتوب</p>
                  <p>I see that death’s arrows kill everyone by the written decree of God.</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Pre-Islamic poets called the divine decree the orders of the Unknown (<italic>umūr ghayb</italic>)<sup>74</sup> and lamented that they knew nothing about it.<sup>75</sup> According to pre-Islamic Arabs, human beings differed from each other not only by appearance and character, but by destiny as well. Some people were destined for good fortune, while others were ill-fated.<sup>76</sup> They were inclined to think that destinies were recorded in scriptures; therefore, poets frequently appealed to the archetype of writing as a mythopoeical image. Believing in the holiness and eternal character of the word and poetry, Jāhiliyya Arabs, like other peoples worldwide, ascribed sanctity to writing. It is precisely this fact that explains the poetical masterpiece, the seven <italic>qaṣīdas</italic>, written with gold and suspended on the walls of the Ka‘ba. Besides that, as follows from pre-Islamic poetry and the records of Muslim tradition, holy scriptures such as the Gospels, Torah, and Psalms were not alien to ancient Arabs. Furthermore, they very likely had their own scriptures. Ibn Hishām has noted a sacred text in Assyrian (Siryānī) that was found in a corner of the Ka‘ba with the beginning words, “I am God the Lord of Bakka.”<sup>77</sup> Another text, <italic>Majalla Luqmān</italic>, has been compared to the Qur’an.<sup>78</sup>It is no wonder that al-Nābigha al-Dhubyānī, while eulogizing Ghassānid ruler ‘Amr b. al-Ḥārith al-Aṣfar, pointed to a divine scripture where the outcomes of every event are written:<sup>79</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>لهمْ شيمة لم يعطها الله غيرهم      من الجود والاحْلام غير عوازب</p>
                  <p>مجلّتهم ذات الاله، ودينُهم           قويمٌ،فما يرجون غير العواقب</p>
                  <p>They have such qualities of nature which God did not bestow upon anyone else—generosity, liberality, and wisdom.</p>
                  <p>Their scripture<sup>80</sup>belongs to God, their religion is strong, and they do not ask other outcomes.</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Another poet, Khuzaz b. Lawdhān, claimed that everything had been written in “the Psalms of ancient and primordial (people)” (<italic>fī-l-zabūr al-’awwaliyyāt al-qadā’im</italic>).<sup>81</sup> Although paradoxical, it is a fact that the nomadic Arabian poet’s lamentations over eternal time were very expressive in the depiction of his temporary dwellings, which was the most fatalistic part of pre-Islamic poetry and indicated the ephemeral character of human life against the immutability of <italic>dahr</italic>. In such illustrations, he usually employed comparisons to sacred texts. In this respect, Reynold Nicholson states: <disp-quote>
                  <p>Already in the sixth century <sc>a.d.</sc> the Bedouin rider made his camel kneel down while he stopped to gaze wonderingly at inscriptions in a strange character engraved on walls of rock or fragments of hewn stone, and compared the mysterious, half-obliterated markings to the almost unrecognisable traces of the camping-ground which for him was fraught with tender memories.<sup>82</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote> Weeping over the traces of an abandoned encampment, Abū Dhu’ayb compared it with the writings of a <italic>Ḥimyar</italic> scribe.<sup>83</sup> In the poem of Imru’ al-Qays, traces of a camp are likened to the writing of a Psalm and the holy scriptures of a monk.<sup>84</sup> ‘Abīd b. al-Abraṣ describes one as “the opening page of a book with its new-limned script.”<sup>85</sup> In the poetry of ‘Antara b. Shaddād (d. <sc>ad</sc> 615), the ruins of the poet’s beloved ‘Abla are like Sasanian writing.<sup>86</sup> These motifs were developed in the poetry of Ṭarafa b. al-‘Abd; ruins of the abandoned encampment in his poem are reminiscent of a tattoo faded from frequent rains.<sup>87</sup> Thus ruins, patterns, running waters, and writings called up an association with inescapable fate. The motif of cyclic recurrence, variability of time, and constant renovation is depicted skillfully in Labīd<italic>’</italic>s <italic>muʿallaqa</italic>, as impetuously flowing rivers wash out the traces of the encampment. However, its traces get renewed as if re-written by the pen:<sup>88</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>....فمدافعُ الريّان عُرّي رسمها            خَلقاً كما ضَمِن الوُحِيّ سِلامها</p>
                  <p>وجَلا السُيولُ عن الطُلولِ كأنها               زُبُرٌ تُجدٌّ مُتونَها اقلامُها....</p>
                  <p>The traces at Rayyān have been bared by torrents; they are like divine writings on stones.</p>
                  <p>The torrents of waters revealed the ruins of encampment, which seem renovated with pen inscriptions of Psalms.</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Clearly, <italic>qalam</italic> (pen) in the Arabic language does not imply merely an instrument for writing but is associated with the act of writing itself, as well as the writing of destinies. The preternatural pen is a tool of fortune-telling and dividing one’s lot.<sup>89</sup> Ancient Arabs called arrows (<italic>azlām</italic>) used for foretelling <italic>qalam</italic>, directly relating the pen to destiny.<sup>90</sup> The motif of the Holy Scripture and Pen has been regularly elaborated upon in Muslim tradition. A central theme in Qur’anic cosmogony is the concept of <italic>al-Lawḥ al-Maḥfūẓ</italic>, the Well-Preserved Tablet (Q.85:22) and Eternal Pen (Q: 68:1, 96:4), on and with which, respectively, the destinies of men have been engraved since the beginning of time.<sup>91</sup>

            <title>Fate-as-judge and Earthly Divine Judgment</title>
            <p>One variation of the Greek Moiras myths says that their mother was Femida, the Goddess of Justice. In pre-Islamic Arabia, the model of fate-as-judge takes a lesser role in comparison with fate-as-time and fate-as-spinner. The words <italic>qaḍā’ wa qadar</italic> (God’s judgment and divine decree) as a term for predestination are mainly employed in the Islamic period, indicating a transition from pagan fatalism to the divine determinism that prevailed in monotheistic societies.<sup>92</sup> On the other hand, pre-Islamic Arabs did not attach particular importance to life after death, or, consequently, the Day of Judgment (Q. 23:82–83; 36:78). According to Homerin, “doctrines of resurrection were regarded as fantastic stories; when death came at its appointed time, meaningful existence was over.”<sup>93</sup> This outlook penetrated their poetry. ‘Abdullāh b. al-Ziba‘rā (d. c. 15/636) considers Resurrection merely a tall tale:<sup>94</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>حياة ثم موت ثم نشر      حديثُ خرافةٍ يا امّ عَمرو</p>
                  <p>Life, then death, then resurrection / All these are superstitions, hey Umm ‘Amr!</p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheless, ancient Arab burial customs point to a belief in some sort of afterlife, probably a kind of reduced existence.<sup>95</sup> Besides that, pre-Islamic poetry contains some accounts of the eschatological views of ancient Arabs, especially on their belief that humans are to pay a penalty for their sins on the Day of Judgment. Such motifs of the afterlife are in abundance in the poetry of Umayya b. Abī l-Ṣalt (d. 5 <sc>bh</sc> / <sc>ad</sc> 626), but its vocabulary strikingly echoes Qur’anic pictures of Doomsday (<italic>yawm al-ḥisāb</italic>), Hell (<italic>nār</italic>, <italic>jaḥīm</italic>, <italic>jahannam</italic>), the Heights (<italic>aʿrāf</italic>), Paradise (<italic>janna</italic>), the Throne (<italic>ʿarsh</italic>), and angels (<italic>malāʾika</italic>) that evoke doubts about their authenticity.<sup>96</sup>
            </p>
            <p>To some degree, eschatological notions have been mirrored in the poetry of ‘Antara b. Shaddād. An excellent contrast is used by the poet in describing Hell<italic>:</italic> “Every time I feel the cool lips of my beloved (on my lips), it seems to me as if an infernal flame roasts me.” In the other poem of ‘Antara, Doomsday is depicted as follows: “Then I returned from them; by this visit I wanted to have memories that would last until Doomsday.”<sup>97</sup> In Zuhayr b. Abī Sulmā’s (5/627) poem, he believed that humans would pay a penalty for their sins when the Day of Judgment came:<sup>98</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>فلا تكتمن الله ما في نفوسكم       ليخفي  مهما  يكتم  الله  يعلم</p>
                  <p>يؤخّر فيوضع في كتاب فيدّخر    ليوم الحساب او يعجّل فينقم</p>
                  <p>You cannot conceal your innermost from Allah, / Whatever you conceal, Allah will know everything.</p>
                  <p>He and He alone keeps a record of everything in the Book, / Delaying for the Day of Judgment, or hastening to get revenge.</p>
               </disp-quote> These examples testify that while engaging with problems of Earthly time, pre-Islamic Arabs were very likely meditating on the time beyond time—the Day of Judgment and the next world. This point established some connection between pre-Islamic and Islamic mystic-fatalistic speculations. Based on the responsibility of man for his thoughts and deeds, Islam considered Allah to be the master of destinies who, in contrast to the ruthless pre-Islamic <italic>dahr</italic>, was merciful and beneficent. On the other hand, time as it was revered by pre-Islamic Arabs was as changeable as a flowing river. Meanwhile, as Seyyid Hossein Nasr states, the symbol of Islamic civilization was “not a flowing river, but the cube of the Ka‘ba, the stability of which symbolizes the permanent and immutable character of Islam.”<sup>99</sup> As in other aspects of life, Islam ameliorated existing norms and practices to make them more hopeful and promising.</p>
            <p>In the minds of the ancient Arabs, the Day of Judgment (y<italic>awm al-ḥisāb</italic>) was not confined to the other world. Especially in southern Arabia, in Yemen, and <italic>Ḥaḍramawt</italic>, Divine Judgment was practiced to find guilty and unfaithful persons. A record about such a judgment has been mirrored in Ibn Hishām’s <italic>al–Sīra:</italic> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>When Tubān ’As‘ad left Mekka, he went to Yemen with his army and the two Jewish priests who had joined him in Medina . . . Ḥimyars did not allow him to enter the country and said: “You repudiated our religion.” Tubān ’As‘ad called them to his worship [i.e., Judaism - A.G.], saying that it is better than theirs. They said: “Let Fire pass judgment between us.” He submitted. At that time in Yemen was the Fire, to which they appealed their disputable issues (<italic>nārun taḥkumu beynahum</italic>). Fire usually devoured an unjust man (<italic>taʾkulu al-ẓālima</italic>) and did not harm an oppressed one (<italic>la taḍurru al-maẓlūma</italic>). Ḥimyars went into the fire with their idols . . . while those two priests (<italic>al-ḥabrāni</italic>) went with Holy Scriptures (<italic>bi-maṣāḥifihimā</italic>) hung on their necks. . . . Fire devoured Ḥimyars and the idols. However, the two priests escaped, safe and sound, with sweaty foreheads and the holy books on their necks. Seeing that, all Ḥimyars adopted the worship of the one God.<sup>100</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote> The abovementioned account (<italic>khabar</italic>) indicates that some legends about miraculous rescue from the fire were circulating in pre-Islamic Arabia. The influence of Zoroastrianism and Persian tradition can be traced through this legend, although the whole story is tinged with Yemenite color.<sup>101</sup> Later, its penetration into the framework of Sufi tradition also becomes clear.<sup>102</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Supposedly these legends were widely shared among people as an oral tradition. They rarely found their way into writing. In this respect, the research work of Anna G. Belova about “Divine Judgment” in the dialects of Ḥaḍramawt is of great interest. Belova’s work identified a number of words related to this ancient concept in these dialects. Subsequently, after being eliminated by Islam, these practices sank into oblivion, but relevant phrases and expressions were preserved in the colloquial language of Ḥaḍramawt. Belova mentions the following phrases: <italic>tarbīʿ</italic>, Divine Judgment; <italic>mubashshiʿ</italic>, Maker of Divine Judgment; and <italic>istamrata</italic>, to ask or to look for Divine Judgment.<sup>103</sup> The two latter phrases have in their ulterior layers such meanings as to burn, to consume, or to bring to a great heat, thus alluding to the ordeal by fire. I have already mentioned the possibility of Zurvanite influence on ancient Arabian conceptions of anthropomorphic-theriomorphic time-as-fate. From records about fire, it becomes clear that Zoroastrian rites deeply affected the spiritual life of Jāhiliyya Arabs, especially the religious views of inhabitants of the southern regions of Arabia, where Persian influence was most notable. Moreover, one can draw parallels with the marvelous tale of Abraham’s escape from fire (Q. 21:69; 29:24; 37:97–98). His name was familiar to Christian Arabs,<sup>104</sup> although the above <italic>khabar</italic> points out another Judaic circle of awareness. In this <italic>khabar</italic>, Zoroastrian notions are contiguous with Judaic apocryphal writings on Abraham that may have circulated in Arabia long before Islam.</p>

      <sec id="sc4">
         <title>Portraits of Fate</title>
         <p>Being powerless against the enigmatic flight of time, ancient Arabs depicted this phenomenon through mysterious imageries, animating abstract notions and phenomena (time, fate, death, etc.) by the use of familiar metaphoric images from daily life, myths, and legends. In pre-Islamic poetry, “Time is represented as bringing misfortune, causing perpetual change, as biting, wearing down, shooting arrows that never miss the mark, hurling stones and so forth.”<sup>105</sup> The fertile imagination of the ancient Arabian poets has left behind a certain number of anthropomorphic-theriomorphic imageries of fate. While anthropomorphizing time-as-fate (<italic>dahr</italic>), pre-Islamic Arabs imagined days and nights to be its sons and daughters; all accidents and misfortunes were the daughters of Fate (<italic>banāt al-dahr</italic>).<sup>106</sup> As al-Ṣā’igh stated, in the perception of pre-Islamic Arabs, time was connected with the death (<italic>mawt</italic>) and perishability (<italic>fanāʾ</italic>) that devoured lives. As courageous and brave as the chivalrous poet may be, one is still left with the impression that fear and apprehension dominated his feelings, even “poems of might and defiance were unable to change the portrait of death in poet’s heart.”<sup>107</sup>
         </p>
         <p>B. Y. Shidfar considered anthropo-zoomorphic imageries of fate in Jāhiliyya poetry to be a “reflection of the moribund pre-Islamic mythology.”<sup>108</sup> On the other hand, some parallels can be drawn to certain descriptions of Zurvān: <disp-quote>
               <p>Monuments portraying the Mithraic God of Time . . . represent the Time god as hideous and as monstrous as possible, with a lion’s head, whose mouth is sometimes illuminated by fire or is blowing fire; entwined by a snake, whose spirals are sometimes decorated with the signs of the zodiac; standing stiff and holding keys before his breast, which can be decorated with eyes (and the knees on one statue) with wings attached to the shoulders.<sup>109</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> Gnostic tradition, an inseparable part of the ancient civilizations of the Near East, explained the diversity of images of Moira, another early image of Arabian fate, as a result of the variety of causes of death which she brought.<sup>110</sup> Seemingly, the many faces of <italic>dahr</italic> in pre-Islamic poetry reflected the multitudinous deadly perils that frightened its poets; to them, <italic>dahr</italic> was unfaithful and perfidious. Imru’ al-Qays, to intensify the unfaithfulness of <italic>dahr</italic>, used the image of <italic>ghūl</italic>, a feminine supernatural creature.<sup>111</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>ألم أخبرك ان الدهر غول           ختور العهد  يلتهم    الرجالا</p>
               <p>أزال من المصانع ذا رياش          وقد ملك السهولة والجبالا</p>
               <p>Did not I warn you that <italic>dahr</italic> is a <italic>ghūl</italic>?</p>
               <p>The perfidies of an epoch devour people.</p>
               <p>It managed to raze “the lord of wealth” (Dhū-Riyāsh) to the ground,</p>
               <p>Who had been the owner of plains and mountains.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>The worlds and imaginations of desert Arabs overflowed with supernatural elements—genies, ghosts, and demons—among which the “bizarre poetic creature,” the <italic>ghūl</italic>, represented the dangers of the road and terrors of night travel.<sup>112</sup> According to Michael Sells, in pre-Islamic poetry: <disp-quote>
               <p>Time as fate (<italic>dahr</italic>) was called many-guised (<italic>dhātu alwānin</italic>), changing, wearing down all things, playing with human aspirations. The desert was many-guised, mirage-filled, leading the journeyer from tract into tract, devouring him. These meanings were personified in the <italic>ghūl</italic>, that female jinni often called simply ‘the many guised’, the multiformed and changing-in-form beguiler of the desert traveler who leads him off the path to his destruction.<sup>113</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> She misled wanderers by making a fire in desert. The weary wayfarer would approach, supposing it to be the fire of a Bedouin encampment and thus falling victim to the <italic>ghūl</italic>, who began to frighten the travelers by assuming horrible appearances. In this respect, of particular interest is the poem by Ta’abbaṭa Sharran, in which this horrible mythological creature was described in a narrative-legendary manner, with human manners and attire but an animal body: her breast is of a camel, head of a cat, and spine of a dog.<sup>114</sup> Ka‘b b. Zuhayr (d. <sc>ad</sc> 662), in his famous poem <italic>Burda</italic>, compared the beloved with the <italic>ghūl</italic>, thus emphasizing the changeability of her feelings and attitude to the lover.</p>
         <p>According to Jāhiliyya poetry, fate was not only deceptive but also cruel. In the poem by al-’A‘shā (about <sc>ad</sc> 570–630), <italic>dahr</italic> shows compassion to neither the old nor the young:<sup>115</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>ولكنْ ارى الدهر الذي  هو خاترٌ،                اذا اصلحتْ كفاي عاد فافْسدا</p>
               <p>شبابٌ وشيْبٌ، وافتقارٌ و ثروة،                   فلِلّه هذا الدهرُ كيف تردّدا</p>
               <p>I saw that Fate is treacherous, if I had a lucky hand, he would return and frustrate,</p>
               <p>Youth and old men, poverty and richness are very fickle due to fate.</p>
            </disp-quote> The therianthropism of the time is exemplified in a remarkable way in the poetry of al-Nābigha al-Dhubyānī, who depicted <italic>dahr</italic> as a predator with claws and as a terrible wolf.<sup>116</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>من يطلب الدهر تدركه مخالبه      والدهر بالوتر ناج غير مطلوب</p>

         <p>Nevertheless, sometimes acts of fate are not accurately premeditated; while deliberately devouring people, it also acts spontaneously. Such poems produce an impression that the world is governed by the rule of chances and accidents that calls forth the idea of another model of fate: fate/fortune. In the <italic>muʿallaqa</italic> of Zuhayr b. Abī Sulmā, death (<italic>manāyā</italic>) is metaphorically compared with a blind camel, walking in darkness:<sup>118</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>رأت المنايا خبط عشواء   من تصب          تمته ومن تخطئ  يعمر ويهرم</p>
               <p>I saw that death like a blind she-camel is blundering. He whom it tramples on accurately it kills, and he whom it fails to kill lives a long life and becomes decrepit.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>To illustrate the omnipotence of <italic>dahr</italic>, pre-Islamic poets referenced stories of annihilated people and earthly lords. The boundaries of these people indicate the wide scope of ancient Arabic perceptions of human society: Egyptian pharaohs, Dhū l-Qarnayn, the Tubba‘a dynasty of the Ḥimyars, Chosroes, “noble blond Roman kings,”<sup>119</sup> the above-mentioned Lord of Wealth Dhū-Riyāsh,<sup>120</sup> and the descendants of the Arabian ruler Mundhir b. Imru’ al-Qays (the so-called <italic>abnāʾ māʾ al-samāʾ</italic>)<sup>121</sup> are frequently mentioned, accentuating the ruthlessness of time. Some people among them were endowed with long life and vitality, which Labīd connected to the expression <italic>abnāʾ māʾ al-samāʾ</italic>:<sup>122</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>شُمْطَ بني ماء السماء ومُرْدَهم      فهل بعدهم من خالدٍ او معمرّ</p>
               <p>The hair of ‘sons of water falling from the sky’ was touched with grey and they grew bald.</p>
               <p>Is there anybody who lived long life and survived after them?</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>The stories of annihilated people are a main portion of the Qur’anic narratives (Q. 7:69–94, 15:78–84, 25:38, 89:6–13). Nevertheless, such narratives differ from pre-Islamic poetic passages; while the Qur’an accentuates the guilt of people whose annihilation appears to be God’s punishment, pre-Islamic poetry laments over their one-time might and bygone majesty.</p>

            <title>Arms and Guards against Anthropomorphic Fate</title>
            <p>Metaphorical images of fate were not only poetical ornaments; they also illustrate the special outlook of desert man engaged in warfare. An ancient Arabian warrior, as described by ‘Amr b. Kulthūm (d. <sc>ad</sc> 584), fought with the sword in close combat, but struck the distant enemy with a spear.<sup>123</sup> Along with arrows, spears were used for fighting from afar, especially for sneak attacks. The warrior-poet frequently utilized the image of arrows shot by the image of the Traitor-Fate, indicating the sudden and perfidious character of his attacks. Labīd lamented over the well-aimed arrows of death (<italic>lā taṭīshu sihāmuhā</italic>).<sup>124</sup> Al-Khansā says that time shot accurately, and his arrows never returned when they struck.<sup>125</sup> Idols also had arrows (<italic>azlām</italic>, <italic>aqdāḥ</italic>) or other arms sometimes used for foretelling. For instance, Manāt had two swords; one of them, the very famous and cherished <italic>Dhū ʾl-fiqār</italic>, was gifted by the Prophet to ‘Alī.<sup>126</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Since fate and death were supposed to be predators, pre-Islamic <italic>kāhins</italic> used arms-oracles (swords, staffs, spears, and bows and arrows) “to catch” them, the same weapons which were taken up against beasts and animals—metaphoric images of fate. The use of bows, staffs, and spears among Jāhiliyya Arabs was not confined to <italic>kāhins</italic>. It was typical of poets and orators, too; they were accustomed, for expressiveness, to brandish bows, staffs, or swords when presenting verses, likely for the purpose of accentuating rhythm.<sup>127</sup> Al-Jāḥiẓ (<sc>ad</sc> 775–868) pointed to the <italic>shuʿūbiyya</italic>, who through misunderstanding, criticized Arabs for using the staff, bow, and spear far from their purpose. For al-Jāḥiẓ, the true sense of this use ran much deeper, and he alluded to their mystical attributes. In <italic>al-Bayān wa-l-tabyīn</italic>, al-Jāḥiẓ cited many records related to the religious magnitude of the staff, “which was made from the burning bush through which God had manifested Himself to the prophet Moses (Mūsā).”<sup>128</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Besides arms, fate—particularly the fate-spinner (<italic>manāyā</italic>)—used rope as a main tool to hold man. Related superstitions appeared in Arabia. People used rope to protect themselves from the evil eye. One poet’s parents were afraid the evil eye would harm him, so they took him to a <italic>shaykh</italic>, who tied rope to his arm as an amulet. For this reason, the poet earned his nickname: Dhū l-Rumma, owner of rope.<sup>129</sup> Some believed practitioners of witchcraft tied knots into rope to harm people. The traces of this art are reflected in the Qur’an where the believer seeks refuge “from the evil of the witches who blow into knots” (Q. 113:4 trans. Aḥmad Riḍā Khān). The tradition says that the <italic>ayat</italic>s were revealed to Muḥammad after magic was worked into his hair by a Jew, Labīd b. al-A‘ṣam, who used a cord with knots, concealed under a stone at the bottom of a well. The prophet was freed from the witchcraft by reciting the <italic>ayats</italic> of <italic>muʿawwidhatayn</italic>, the <italic>suras al-Falaq</italic> and <italic>al-Nās</italic>.<sup>130</sup>

         <title>Signs of Fate</title>
         <p>Although unpredictable, fate was believed to give signs and tokens about future events, signs that opened a path to practicing divination. As a whole, Cicero classified two kinds of divination among ancient nations: dependent on art, or dependent on natural power. The first kind included the prophecies of soothsayers, augurs, astrologers, and oracles; the second was a natural means of divination—the forewarnings of dreams or ecstasy manifested through certain natural powers, making prophetic announcements of the future. <sup>131</sup> In this sort of divination, the revelations were perceived as a divine gift.</p>
         <p>The same divinatory tendencies are noticed in pre-Islamic Arabia. Muslim tradition ascribed the latter types of sign-readings to prophecy, saying that only prophethood was a truly divine gift. The first category of soothsayers were <italic>kāhin</italic>s and <italic>ʿarrāf</italic>s, who were merely versed in occult sciences, magic, and clairvoyance.<sup>132</sup> By the testimony of Ibn Khaldūn (d. <sc>ad</sc> 1406), both prophets and <italic>kāhin</italic>s made predictions, but prophets ranked higher than <italic>kāhin</italic>s, because prophets received messages from God Almighty, while the foretellings of <italic>kāhin</italic>s occurred due to a connection with the supernatural, such as a demon or jinn. <italic>Kāhin</italic>s usually resorted to help from a mirror, water, the flight of birds, the internal organs of animals, or rhythmic-rhymed utterances (so-called <italic>sajʿ</italic>) to receive predictions.<sup>133</sup> According to al-Jāḥiẓ, every <italic>kāhin</italic> had his <italic>rāʾī</italic> for foretelling. <italic>Rāʾī</italic> were reckoned to be some kind of <italic>jinn</italic> that sympathized with humans and became attached to them.<sup>134</sup> Pre-Islamic men generally trusted in predictions that were presented as divine decrees, and medieval Arab sources still abounded in records of this kind.<sup>135</sup>
         </p>
         <p>While <italic>kāhin</italic>s predicted the future, <italic>ʿarrāf</italic>s gave information about events of the past. As people tended to be more interested in knowing the future than the past, they venerated <italic>kāhin</italic>s more than <italic>ʿarrāf</italic>s.<sup>136</sup> On the other hand, they did not think that <italic>ʿarrāf</italic>s communicated with supernatural powers as <italic>kāhin</italic>s did. <italic>ʿArrāf</italic>s usually presented clairvoyance via insight and analysis. Some predictions relied on popular superstitions or beliefs in omens held by ordinary people. In pre-Islamic Arabia, such arts of augury as by birds’ flight, or by physiognomy, as well as extispicy, were widely practiced.</p>
         <sec id="sc5.1">
            <title>Muslim Hagiography and <italic>kāhin</italic> Practice</title>
            <p>Islam denounced <italic>kāhin</italic>s as a religious caste related to heathen rites and occult practices, with minor reservations: some pre-Islamic <italic>kāhin</italic>s had foretold the prophetic mission of Muḥammad and became Muslims. Consequently, many records on <italic>kāhin</italic> practices were irrevocably lost; nevertheless, divinations about the coming of the Prophet Muḥammad were reflected in some authoritative sources of Muslim hagiography.<sup>137</sup> All these accounts are of great value about the mystical life of pre-Islamic Arabs.<sup>138</sup> Below I scrutinize two such records (<italic>khabar</italic>s) documented in <italic>al-Sīra al-Nabawiyya</italic> by Ibn Hishām. The first <italic>khabar</italic> says: <disp-quote>
                  <p>There was the tribe of Janb in Yemen, which had a very famous <italic>kāhin</italic>. When the mission of the Messenger of God became perfectly clear to everybody, the tribesmen said to the <italic>kāhin</italic>: “Foresee for us about the case of this man?” (<italic>unẓur lanā fī amr hāzā al-rajul</italic>) The people assembled by the mountain. As soon as the Sun rose, he descended, and reclining to his bow (<italic>muttakiʾan ʿalā qaws lahu</italic>), continued to stay for a while, turning his face toward the heavens. After standing for a long time, he began jumping (<italic>jaʿala yanzū</italic>). Later, he said, “Oh people! Allah has given Muḥammad the blessing and chosen him as His messenger. He has cleansed his heart from filth (<italic>ṭahhara qalbahu</italic>) and inflated it (with wisdom). But this man will not stay among you for a long time.” Then he climbed up the mountain from where he had come.<sup>139</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>This story does not reveal the mental state of the <italic>kāhin</italic>, and surely no common language could capture his ecstatic experience, his feelings of communication with divinity. However, the story on the whole is connected with the attributes of mystical experience. The typology of similar practices suggests that the case in point is an ecstatic cult—to be more precise, the spiritual levitation of the Arabian <italic>kāhin</italic>. The occurrence takes place on a mountain, a place already thought to be conducive to ecstasy; from time immemorial, people have supposed that union with divinity required access to the highest places. Echoes of more ancient religious beliefs appear among the ancient Arabs. The burning interest is evoked by a <italic>khabar</italic> that says that before Islam there was a <italic>ḥanīf</italic> in Mecca who built a very high, staged tower with stairs on the outskirt of the city, which he ascended to communicate with God prior to making predictions. This was Wakī‘ b. Salama b. Zuhayr al-Iyādī, known as <italic>ṣāhib al-ṣarḥ</italic> (the owner of the tower). People considered him the most truthful among all soothsayers. He always said his predictions on <italic>sajʿ</italic> ; therefore, he was called <italic>kāhin</italic>.<sup>140</sup>
            </p>
            <p>As seen in the aforementioned passage from <italic>al-Sīra al-Nabawiyya</italic>, to attain spiritual union with divinity, the <italic>kāhin</italic> of the Janb tribe used a bow, which was rooted in the mystical rituals of ancient Arabs as a symbol of the Sun; it is no wonder that predictions were made at sunrise. The bow had always been considered by Arabs to be the symbol of union between tribes and clans. As noted above, bows and arrows were employed as oracles by <italic>kāhins</italic> and carried associated beliefs and superstitions. When ancient Arabs concluded an alliance, they drew their bows, one on top of the other, and shot the arrows together. This act stood for common joy and anger.<sup>141</sup> In another tradition, when Arab tribes wanted to end discord and make peace, all the male people of those tribes gathered along the borders of their territory with their bows in hand.<sup>142</sup> Bows denoting contact among peoples and tribes took on special meaning in mystic practices, representing the union between God and human beings. This symbolic meaning of the bow has also been reflected in the biography of the prophet Muḥammad. Sura <italic>al-Najm</italic> says that during his spiritual journey to the abode of God, he was at a distance of but two bowlengths (<italic>qāba qawsayn</italic>) or nearer to divinity (Q. 53:9). In Niẓāmī’s <italic>Iskandarnāme</italic> (<italic>Sharafnāme</italic>), when the prophet Muḥammad is released from his corporeal being, he finds himself inside a spiritual circle consisting of two bows.<sup>143</sup>
            </p>
            <p>In the second legend in <italic>al-Sīra al-Nabawiyya</italic> by Ibn Hishām, the coming of the Prophet is announced at the ceremony of sacrifice. In ancient mysteries, the ceremony of sacrifice was frequently used for the purpose of clairvoyance.<sup>144</sup> A Jewish scholar in the third century said that he had witnessed the Arabs slaughter a lamb for the purpose of foretelling by its liver. <sup>145</sup> This kind of clairvoyance is named extispicy and had long been common in China, southeastern Asia, and Mesopotamia.<sup>146</sup> A very important account from <italic>al-Sīra al-Nabawiyya</italic> illustrates this act, relating the phenomena to the times of the Prophet Muḥammad: <disp-quote>
                  <p>‘Umar b. al-Khaṭṭāb said that once, not long before Islam, he was among the people from the Quraysh tribe by an idol (<italic>wathan</italic>), and a man was slaughtering a calf (<italic>ʿijl</italic> ) as a sacrifice to the idol. People had assembled there and waited for the dispensation of meat to receive their portion. At that time, a strange voice came from the belly of the calf (<italic>min jawf al-ʿijl</italic> ), and the most impressive words were heard: “Oh Dharīḥ!<sup>147</sup> Something great is expected. A man will come and proclaim: <italic>La ilāha illa-llāh!</italic> (There is no God except Allah.)”<sup>148</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>As seen in the above cited passages, Muslim sources considered the emergence of Islam as divinely predestined. Even the oracles of the Jāhiliyya idols foretold the coming of the Prophet, thus increasing the conviction of pagan Arabs to adopt Islam. Sergey A. Frantsuzoff referred to several legendary accounts of this kind that circulated in the area of Ḥaḍramawt. One of these legends tells of a man from the Banū ‘Āmir tribe who was slaughtering a sacrificial animal to the idol Jalsad. Suddenly a thunderclap burst, and someone shouted, heralding the crucial events that would happen in Arabia: the coming of the Prophet, the elimination of idolatry, the Arabian invasions of Iraq, and the overthrow of the Sasanian Empire. All these predictions sounded like events foreordained by God.<sup>149</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Some points in these acts merit special attention. In these records, predictions were made not by the shape or structure of the entrails of a sacrificial animal, as had been practiced in Mesopotamia, but by the noises coming from the dying animal. The <italic>khabar</italic> mentioned by al-Dimashkī (d. <sc>ad</sc> 1327) describes <italic>ṣābians</italic> who made predictions based on the death convulsions of a sacrificial cock.<sup>150</sup> These death convulsions were held to be noteworthy since they took place in the peculiar state between death and life: in contrast to Mesopotamian standards, Arab priests made predictions not by lifeless organs, but by using the animal as a mediator between the real and spiritual worlds. In this state of agony, the spirit of the animal was thought to vacillate between the body that it had not yet left completely and the world of spirits to which it had not yet entirely succumbed, allowing mediation between the physical and supernatural worlds. According to Ibn Khaldūn, this state was important for clairvoyance; therefore, some tyrants organized executions to hear predictions from prisoners about worrisome questions.<sup>151</sup>
            </p>
            <p>A barely perceptible allusion to extispicy appears in <italic>Kitāb al-aṣnām</italic> by Ibn al-Kalbī (d. <sc>ad</sc> 819). A poet from Banū Huzayl, for instance, scorned a man who wanted to sacrifice a calf with a spot in its eyes (since a sacrificial animal must be without blemish, he rushed the process to hide its malady).<sup>152</sup> Later, under the influence of pre-Islamic popular beliefs, some Sufi brotherhoods added rites of sacrifice to their spiritual ceremonies to expel malicious ghosts; they also incorporated various types of shamanic levitation for union with the spirits of dead men.<sup>153</sup> Their influence was particularly felt during sacrifice ceremonies on the graves of Sufi saints.</p>

         <sec id="sc5.2">
            <title>Visual Surroundings as a Tool of Predictions</title>
            <p>The tools that Jāhiliyya Arabs employed as oracles provide clear evidence that the main sources of their foretelling came from the surrounding world—water, birds, stars, mirrors, bones of animals, fire, and arrows. Umayya b. Abī l-Ṣalt considered the song of birds and cries of animals to be the manifestation of the Divine Will.<sup>154</sup> Pre-Islamic man considered his own body to be a part of this signifying universe and tried to predict events by his own facial features, lines of his hand, his name, his dreams, and his sneezes. Although these predictions had little to do with knowledge or science, in the subject index of medieval Arab sources, they (<italic>ʿiyāfa</italic>, <italic>qiyāfa</italic>, <italic>ta’bīr al-ruʾyā</italic> and so forth) were coded as <italic>maʿārif</italic> (knowledge).</p>
            <p>A widespread form of prediction was through physiognomy, known as <italic>firāsa</italic> or <italic>qiyāfa</italic>, and it presented itself as the whole scope of beliefs and superstitions. Supposedly, ancient Arabs were aware of Polemon’s (<sc>ad</sc> 88–144) treatise on physiognomy, which was translated into Syriac in the fifth or sixth century.<sup>155</sup> In pre-Islamic Arabia, seers (<italic>ʿarrāfs</italic>) gathered in ‘Ukāẓ, and parents appealed to them to foretell the fates of their children by these signs.<sup>156</sup> Ancient Jewish tradition traces this art back to the times of the prophet Moses: the Talmud says that some people in Yemen had a great capacity for determining the hidden characteristics of a man by the features of his face. According to this story, when the mission of the Prophet Moses began, the Arabian king (the legendary Yemenite king from the dynasty Tubba‘a, al-Rā’ish al-Akbar—A.G.) commissioned a portrait of Moses so that the wise men of his court, who were skillful in the art of physiognomy, could determine his character.<sup>157</sup> Ibn Hishām’s <italic>al-Sīra</italic> relates that the sister of Waraqa b. Nawfal, when she met ‘Abdullāh, the father of the future prophet Muḥammad, understood from the shining of his forehead that he was carrying the semen that would result in the birth of the prophet and offered him intimacy.<sup>158</sup> Like other components of the <italic>Jāhiliyya</italic> mentality, physiognomy also flourished during the Islamic period.<sup>159</sup> 
               <italic>Firāsa</italic> as a term “does not occur in the Qur’an, but one could argue that some physiognomic ingredients are present.”<sup>160</sup> In the Qur’an, the marks of true believers and unbelievers are apparent on their faces (Q. 47:30, 48:29).<sup>161</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Some information about the methods of prediction used by Jāhiliyya Arabs is found in pre-Islamic poetry. Fortune-telling by arrows (<italic>ʾazlām</italic>) is depicted in both the poetry and biography of Imru’ al-Qays.<sup>162</sup> Divinations from stars are depicted in the famous <italic>khuṭba</italic> of Quss b. Sā‘ida (d. ca. <sc>ad</sc> 600), who claimed that “there is <italic>khabar</italic> (a record) in the heavens,”<sup>163</sup> and Ta’abbaṭa Sharran felt that he was guided by the Milky Way.<sup>164</sup> The poem of al-A‘shā shows that ancient Arabs practiced the art of interpreting character and telling fortunes by the configuration of lines on a person’s palm (chiromancy):<sup>165</sup> 
               <disp-quote>
                  <p>انظر الى كف واسرارها           هل انت ان اوعدتني صابري</p>
                  <p>Look at the hand and its mysteries.</p>
                  <p>Even if you threaten me, how would you prevent me?<sup>166</sup>
                  </p>
               </disp-quote>
            </p>
            <p>
               <italic>Jāhiliyya</italic> Arabs also gave special meaning to sneezing and yawning. In the poem of Imru’ al-Qays, they were both considered to be ill omens.<sup>167</sup> Later, in the Muslim tradition, sneezing was ascribed to angels, but yawning to Satan.<sup>168</sup> Nevertheless, these superstitions seem rather outdated on the eve of Islam and yielding to the idea of eternal writing. The pre-Islamic poet saw neither foretelling by sneezing (<italic>al-tashāʾum bi-l-ʿuṭās</italic>), nor belief in lots (<italic>maqāsim</italic>) and amulets (<italic>al-tamāʾim</italic>), because everything had been written in “the Psalms of ancient and primordial (people)” (<italic>fī al-zabūr al-ʾawwaliyyāt al-qadāʾim</italic>).<sup>169</sup>
            </p>
            <p>By all appearances, everything connected with natural phenomena, particularly the heavens, had been believed to be imprinted on the mind of ancient Arabs by clairvoyance. It is no wonder that they believed in the bond of birds with the supernatural and told fortunes by them. This practice was named <italic>ʿiyāfa</italic> or <italic>zajr al-ṭayr</italic> (flashing of birds); as Cicero described it: “The Arabians . . . being chiefly engaged in the rearing of cattle, constantly wandering over the plains and mountains in winter and summer and, on that account, have found it quite easy to study the songs and flight of birds.”<sup>170</sup> They distracted birds by throwing stones or shouting, and if a bird flew to the right, towards the rising sun, it meant good fortune; if to the left, towards the setting sun, it predicted bad luck.<sup>171</sup> This form of prediction is echoed in pre-Islamic poetry, such as in the ode of al-Nābigha al-Dhubyānī devoted to Mutajarrida, the wife of the Lakhmid ruler of Ḥīra Nu‘mān b. Mundhir (d. ca. <sc>ad</sc> 602). The poet commences his ode describing a flight of birds veering to the left (<italic>bawāriḥ</italic>) alongside the cawing of a crow,<sup>172</sup> “whose voice was the voice of Fate.”<sup>173</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Another metaphoric image of time-as-fate is that of the legendary Lubad, the last of the vultures of Luqmān b. ‘Ād.<sup>174</sup> The image of the soul transformed into an owl hooting “Give me drink, give me the blood of my murderer to drink” was mirrored in Jāhiliyya poetry. <sup>175</sup> Furthermore, pre-Islamic Arabs ascribed some miracles connected with the birds to kinsmen. According to legend, the failed prophet Umayya b. Abī l-Ṣalt, like the prophet Sulaymān, was able to understand the tongue of animals and birds. The legend says that his chest was cut open by the birds to be cleansed of every kind of sin and filthiness;<sup>176</sup> and that he had foretold his own death through the cawing of a crow.<sup>177</sup> Subsequently, such a prophecy was assigned to animals and plants by examining their motions, names, and specific features. Among the Arabian tribes, the Banū Azd were said to have been very practiced in this field.<sup>178</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Ancient Arabs also participated in <italic>khaṭṭ al-raml</italic> (telling the future by lines on the sand), which absorbed the influence of Ṣābiism. This kind of clairvoyance attached a special importance to geometrical lines and figures. The account in Ibn Khaldūn’s <italic>Muqaddima</italic> says that although Islam rejected clairvoyance by lines in the sand, for some people this foretelling remained a prophetic art; the prophet Idrīs was singled out as the inventor of this kind of divination. Nevertheless, Muslim scholars rejected such a statement as a misunderstanding of the prophetic tradition: “A prophet drew lines and whose lines were correct, he was a prophet.” Ibn Khaldūn says that this tradition does not mean <italic>khaṭṭ</italic> by drawing lines on sand but receiving revelations during writing (<italic>khaṭṭ</italic>) in general.<sup>179</sup>
            </p>
            <p>Pre-Islamic Arabs were also experienced in the interpretation of dreams (<italic>taʿbīr al-ruʾyāʾ</italic>). In the Muslim tradition, prophetic dreams are one of the forty-six parts of a prophecy. Ibn Khaldūn emphasizes the particular importance of prophetic dreams in the mystic-spiritual life of the Arabs. All dreams were divided into three categories: prophetic dreams from Allah, which did not require interpretation; allegorical dreams from angels, where the prediction presented itself as symbols and reminiscences that were explained by interpretation; and deceptive dreams from demons (<italic>shayṭāns</italic>).<sup>180</sup> In the <italic>Qurʾan</italic>, this last category was named <italic>Adghāth ʾaḥlām</italic> (“confused dreams,” Q. 3:5). Dalia Urbonaite notices that <disp-quote>
                  <p>incubational rites, associated with dreams, generally take place near graves. Often a female ghost-patron of the poet could be related to the motif of <italic>khayāl</italic> (or <italic>ṭayf</italic> ) in Arabic poetry: during the time when the poet spends a night near the remnants of an abandoned camp, in his dream vision the parted beloved appears. . . . Arab poets not only spend nights and dream near camps or graves, but they also try to ask questions, which birds can answer.<sup>181</sup>

            <p>In pre-Islamic Arabia, <italic>taʿbīr al-ruʾyāʾ</italic> was an art related to the <italic>kāhin</italic>s. Among them, Saṭīḥ and Shaqq (both sixth century <sc>ad</sc>) were very knowledgeable. They not only interpreted stated dreams, but also guessed at them. When the king of Yemen was anxious about a nightmare, he called all <italic>kāhin</italic>s to interpret it, but he did not tell anybody what he had dreamt. This prediction was beyond the skills of most. Only Saṭīḥ and Shaqq could guess, and they both predicted the mission of the Prophet Muḥammad.<sup>182</sup> After the emergence of Islam, this tradition was practiced by the companions (<italic>ṣaḥāba</italic>) of Muḥammad. Abū Bakr (d. <sc>ad</sc> 634) was distinguished for his proficiency in the art of interpreting dreams. The interpretation of dreams played a particular role in the practice of Sufi orders. Particularly, <italic>taʿbīr al-ruʾyāʾ</italic> was widely practiced by the Khalwatiyya order as the main pillar of their Path.<sup>183</sup>

         <title>Determined Fate and Individual Goal-Settings</title>
         <p>Divinations and predictions fulfilled not only the desire to know fate in advance but also opened the horizons to interfere in divine predestination. It was very important for pre-Islamic man to find a way to overcome time. Nevertheless, his attitude to fate went beyond worshipping and pleading for mercy: in some cases, he would challenge fate and declare his own principles of life. In some pre-Islamic poetry, the poet’s awareness of his total powerlessness against cruel fate coincides with the motif of his proud attempts to face the challenges of life.<sup>184</sup> In his famous <italic>Lāmiyya</italic>, vagabond poet al-Shanfarā (d. ca. <sc>ad</sc> 510) likened himself to a wolf and took pride in looking at Sirius (a metamorphosis of <italic>dahr</italic>),<sup>185</sup> which, according to ancient beliefs, descended from the heavens to harm people.<sup>186</sup> Going even further, ‘Āmir b. Ṭufeyl represented himself as a symbolic analogue of time in these terms:<sup>187</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>فانّ لنا حكومة كل يوم   يبين في مفاصله الصواب</p>
               <p>And verily to us belongs the right of everyday decisions, when the right course is made plain in matters of judgment.<sup>188</sup>

            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>The widely spread idiom, <italic>ḥalabtu al-dahr ashṭurah</italic> (“I milked the nipples of <italic>dahr</italic>,” i.e., “I endured much”), in which fate is imagined as a she-camel, also indicates the fortitude and patience of the desert man. In other words, fatalistic tendencies did not preclude individual goal-setting, and liability to the command of the unknown did not remove the possibility of free will.<sup>189</sup> Imru’ al-Qays declares his moral code, claiming that in the face of the ruthless unknown, he spends his days in celebration, but he never violates the principles of honesty:<sup>190</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>ارانا موضعين لامر غيب               ونسحر بالطعام والشراب</p>
               <p>عصافير و ذبّان ودود                      واجرأ في مجلحة الذئاب</p>
               <p>وكل مكارم الاخلاق صارت                 اليه همتي وبه اكتسابي</p>
               <p>فإني               ستكفيني التجارب وانتسابي ،فبعض اللوم عاذلتي</p>
               <p>الى عرق الثرى وشجت عروقي         وهذا الموت يسلبني شبابي</p>
               <p>ونفسي سوف يسلبها و جرمي                  فيلحقني وشيكا بالتباب</p>
               <p>I see we are running to the command of the unknown / but spending our days in feasts and carouses.</p>
               <p>Although we are like sparrows, flies, and worms, we are more courageous than the voracious wolf.</p>
               <p>My endeavors are for noble morality, and with honesty alone, I earn my livelihood.</p>
               <p>O blasphemer! Leave your reproach! I am too experienced and of too noble descent for this.</p>
               <p>My roots go to the ancient human clan.<sup>191</sup> But Death plunders my youth.</p>
               <p>He plunders both my soul and my body. He will immediately catch me and kill me.</p>

         <p>Another attitude towards cruel fate was endurance. Thus, elements of patience (<italic>ṣabr</italic>) are also found in pre-Islamic poetry. Ṭarafa persuades his soul to be patient:<sup>192</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>وتشكَّى النفس ماصاب بها        فاصبري إنك من قوم صبر</p>
               <p>My soul complains about what happened to him. Be patient, you are of patient folk.</p>
            </disp-quote> Ḍābi’ b. al-Ḥārith also called for obedience and patience in the face of vicissitudes of <italic>dahr</italic>:<sup>193</sup> 
            <disp-quote>
               <p>فلا خير فيمن لا يوطن نفسه على نائبات الدهر حين تنوب</p>
               <p>There is no virtue in someone who does not control himself when hard times fall upon him.</p>
            </disp-quote> The motif of <italic>ṣabr</italic> in pre-Islamic poetry is “fortitude in the face of enemy attack and physical suffering,”<sup>194</sup> which is different from Islamic “patience.” This attitude is the patience of the courageous knight, the proud endurance of the Bedouin in the face of the tricks of fate and its tyranny. In the Islamic period, “the ideal man was he who disregarded danger and practiced these noble pursuits with complete assurance” (<italic>īmān</italic>).<sup>195</sup> If pre-Islamic patience was the Bedouin’s defiance toward misfortune, the Islamic <italic>ṣabr</italic> was firmly patient while awaiting the mercy and grace of God.<sup>196</sup>

         <title>Conclusion</title>
         <p>Pre-Islamic mentality served as a kind of fracturing sphere where a great number of outlooks and legends of neighboring people were subject to mutual contiguity and transformations in accordance with purely Arab realities. In this sphere, the Bedouin mentality changed the dual function of Iranian Zurvān, reducing his positive side and representing him as ill fate; transformed the ropes of destiny of the Greek Moirais to the snares of death; and challenged pre-ordained fate with Bedouin morality and chivalry. On the eve of Islam, the superstitions and beliefs of Arabs, the instability and changeability of their outlooks, their attempts to predict future events, and their inclination to the occult sciences represent characteristic features of the great transition period—the transition from polytheism to monotheism, from idolatry to Islam, and from the accumulation of scattered Arabian tribes to the great Arabic-Islamic power. The fracture in the Bedouins’ concepts of time-as-fate found further reflection in Islam; Allah overwhelmed changeable <italic>dahr</italic> ; nooses of death faced the strong rope of Islam (<italic>ḥabl Allāh</italic>); <italic>sawāniḥ wa bawāriḥ</italic> transformed into metaphors of the scroll of destiny fastened to the necks of men; <italic>qaḍā wa qadar</italic> left no room for <italic>manāyā; ṣabr</italic> appeared to be an important element of Muslim life; and earthly divine judgment retreated before the great Day of Judgment. Even time itself was represented as something marvelous and incomprehensible by marking one day as equal to a thousand years in the sight of Allah (Q. 22:47, 70:4).</p>
