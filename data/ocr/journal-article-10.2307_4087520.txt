ISBN 0-87745- 150-8. $25.00.-In 1935 Alexander Skutch alerted or- nithologists to a phenomenon that at the time was virtually unknown: the existence of "helpers at the nest" in several bird species (1935, Auk 52: 257). A helper, as later defined by Skutch (1961, Condor 63: 198), is an individual that "feeds or otherwise attends a bird ... which is neither its mate nor its dependent offspring." Although ornithologists initially were slow to appreciate the evolutionary significance of helping behavior, important advances in evolutionary theory in the mid-1960's precipitated an explosion of interest in helping and cooperative breeding that continues to the present. And now, half a century after Skutch's initial paper, he has taken on the daunting task of reviewing the rapidly expanding field that he in no small part defined. Skutch's book is, in fact, one of two full-length reviews of helping and cooperative breeding pub- lished in 1987 (see also J. L. Brown, 1987, Helping and communal breeding in birds, Princeton, New Jer- sey, Princeton Univ. Press). Unlike Brown, whose monograph is intended for professional biologists, Skutch has targeted a broader audience that includes naturalists and amateur ornithologists, primarily "to make helpful birds more generally known" (p. x). Following a short preface and introductory chapter, Skutch embarks on an exhaustive, and occasionally exhausting, 238-page, 49-chapter systematic survey of helping behavior and cooperative breeding in birds. Each chapter begins with a brief description of the natural history of the family or other taxonomic group under consideration, followed by species-by-species accounts of helping behavior drawn from the liter- ature. These chapters include accounts of species that live in stable, complex groups within which helping is regular (a situation that Skutch designates as "ad- vanced cooperative breeding"), and species for which rare instances of intraspecific and interspecific help- ing have been observed only incidentally. The species accounts are nontechnical and vary in length from one or two sentences to a few pages. Most of the chapters are illustrated by Dana Gardner's attractive line drawings, which depict one or more of the species discussed in the text. The systematic survey is fol- lowed by three concluding chapters on the signifi- cance of interspecific helping, the characteristics of advanced cooperatively breeding species, and the benefits and evolution of cooperative breeding. A bib- liography includes over 400 references. The systematic survey is the heart and soul of the book, and Skutch's deep natural-history roots are ev- ident in his clear, painstakingly written species ac- counts. These core chapters, however, also have a number of weaknesses. Many readers unfamiliar with the field (and these are the readers for whom the book was written) will be overwhelmed by Skutch's com- prehensive treatment. The inclusion of detailed ac- counts of poorly studied species, or species in which helping occurs rarely, dilutes the impact of accounts of well-studied, more socially sophisticated species where cooperative breeding is regular and better understood. Furthermore, Skutch has eschewed the use of tables or figures that would help newcomers comprehend, organize, and classify the diverse body of information provided. In the preface Skutch acknowledges the difficulties of writing a review of a young and growing field from his home in Costa Rica, far from an adequate ornithological library. Considering the logistic prob- lems involved, Skutch has done an admirable job. Nonetheless, as a result of either Skutch's isolation or unavoidable publication delays, the book is not up-to-date. Only 12 of the 406 cited references ap- peared later than 1983, and several important works published in nonornithological sources during 1981- 1983 are not included. Perhaps the most unfortunate omission is the research by Kerry Rabenold and his colleagues on the Stripe-backed Wren (Campylorhyn- chus nuchalis) of Venezuela. Although this wren is now one of the most thoroughly studied coopera- tively breeding birds, complete accounts of its social organization and behavior were not published until 1984 and 1985, and the species, regrettably, receives no mention in Skutch's book. An additional, although minor, difficulty with the systematic survey results from Skutch's decision to forgo text citations in favor of a listing of pertinent references (by author and date) at the end of every chapter. This works well enough in most cases, es- pecially when the reference list is short and field researchers are mentioned by name in the text. Read- ers who wish to learn more about an interesting tidbit reported in the text, however, occasionally will have to wade through a long list of author-and-date cita- tions at the end of the chapter, checking each against the full citation in the bibliography, to find the ap- propriate reference or references.</page><page sequence="2">April 1988] Reviews 403 Many readers probably will feel that the limited synthesis provided by the three concluding chapters is too little too late. Although the final chapter touch- es on most of the major issues involved in the evo- lution of cooperative breeding, a coherent framework to help readers understand the important questions, the possible answers, and the relevant field data is lacking. Instead, the final chapter is primarily a per- sonal essay on the benefits and evolution of cooper- ative breeding that is occasionally anthropomorphic and frequently group-selectionist. I suspect that the curious naturalists for whom Skutch has written this book will feel that their questions about cooperative breeding have not been addressed satisfactorily, much less answered. "Helpers at Birds' Nests" is attractively produced and remarkably free of substantive or typographical errors. Nonetheless, I recommend it only for indi- viduals and libraries interested in an exhaustive but somewhat outdated natural-history survey of helping and cooperative breeding. Researchers active in this field will find the book's systematic approach and extensive bibliography occasionally useful in provid- ing access to the older and less familiar literature. For these specialists, however, other recently published reviews of helping behavior and cooperative breed- ing will be far more useful.-RONALD L. MUMME.</page></plain_text>
