<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Parody to Paradox: Jacques Cazotte and the Emergence of the Fantastic Markus Muller Q k_/ince its publication in 1772, Jacques Cazotte's Le Diable amoureux has remained a somewhat obscure text despite occasional appearances in the spotlight of literary analysis and theory. One such appearance occurred in 1975 when Tzvetan Todorov used the novel to il- lustrate his definition of the fantastic. Central to the creation of the fantastic is the juxtaposition of the natural and the supernatural world that causes an am- biguity in the novel. The main protagonist as well as the reader cannot solve the puzzle and the moment of hesitation experienced by both leads directly to Todorov's well-known definition of the fantastic: "The fantastic occupies the duration of this uncertainty. Once we choose one answer over the other, we leave the fantastic for a neighboring genre, the uncanny or the marvelous. The fantastic is that hesitation experienced by a person who knows only the laws of nature, confronting an apparently supernatural event" (25). But Todorov's rather rigid structural definition of the fantastic, one that contemplates the protagonist's hesitation only in aesthetic terms, i.e. for the purpose of defining a literary genre, also prompts him to eliminate Cazotte's work from the list of truly fantastic works because it "offers insufficient substance for a more ex- tended analysis: here the hesitation occupies us only a moment" (27). We need not dismiss Le Diable amoureux as a fantastic story worth our interest if we focus on the fantastic as an essentially paradoxical structure. The relevance of paradox for our analysis of the fantastic becomes clear if we consider the natural and the supernatural as two apparently unacceptable nar- rative parameters. When used separately, such as in a realist novel or a fairy tale respectively, they are unproblematic modes of narration. Brought to- gether, however, in a single narrative they necessarily challenge each other and provoke a disturbance at the level of comprehension. Because a paradox by definition is composed in such a way that neither one of its constituents, in our case the two different narrative modes, can prevail over the other, the only requirement we have to ask from a fantastic story is that it develop such a par- adoxical-fantastic situation at least once during the narration. Even if the fan- tastic phenomenon is resolved in the story itself, as it is often the case, the most important goal of the fantastic has been achieved: it has caused enough structural disturbance for the reader to hesitate and reinvestigate the validity of the story's content. Because the intrusion of the supernatural into the Vol. 15, No.4, Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts Copyright © 2004, International Association for the Fantastic in the Arts. 320</page><page sequence="2">Markus Muller natural world in almost all fantastic stories goes hand in hand with some sort of violent act, the interpretation of the story at the aesthetic level cannot be complete without a look at its ethic component. 1 Paradoxes, as well as fantastic stories, cannot be solved from within, and therefore some sort of artificial solution is frequently imposed on them from the outside. These solutions constitute, as I will argue, a social commentary on how the fantastic phenomenon should be interpreted. This is the case with Le Diable amoureux where the mother of the novel's principal character and her counselor are more than eager to "solve" the problem to their satisfaction. Richard M. Sainsbury underlines the intellectual and social relevance of para- doxes: Paradoxes are serious. Unlike party teasers, which are also fun, par- adoxes raise serious problems. Historically, they are associated with crisis in thought and with revolutionary advances. To grapple with them is not merely to engage in an intellectual game, but is to come to grips with key issues (1). To complete my argument of the relationship between the fantastic and para- doxes, I refer to José Monleón's A Specter is Haunting Europe. In this "social history of the fantastic," Monléon explicitly links the development of this lit- erary mode to a series of revolutionary, sociological, and economic changes from the French Revolution to the Revolution of 1848 and the 1917 October Revolution in Russia (4). Like paradoxes, fantastic literature is associated with revolutionary advances and one of the key issues with which we have to come to grips in the fantastic is the concept of representation and its conse- quences in the domain of ethics and human interaction. On the eve of the French Revolution, Cazotte's artistic career reached its peak with Le Diable amoureux. Almost 60 years before this literary mode be- came fashionable in France, Cazotte had produced an early masterpiece as the result of a gradual shift from the unproblematic world of the marvelous (the fairy tale) towards the aesthetically more complex and ethically more disturb- ing fantastic. A comparison between Cazotte's Ollivier, poème (1 763) and the genesis of Le Diable amoureux illustrates this shift. Moreover, I intend to show that Cazotte is the first author who explores the possibilities as well as the dangers inherent in metaphoric language by means of the literary fantas- tic. Throughout his entire life, Jacques Cazotte (1719-1792) was an astute ob- server of and active participant in the political and cultural life of his country. He published his first work La Patte du chat in 1741 and Les Mille et une fadaises in 1742. As the two titles indicate, Cazotte's first tales were written in the tradition of the European folk tale (. Märchen ; conte de féé), such as Charles Perrault's Histoires ou contes du temps passé , avec des moralitez (1697), and the equally popular exotic fairy tale in the style of Antoine Galand's French version of Les Mille et une nuits published successively from 321</page><page sequence="3">From Parody to Paradox 1 704 to 1 7 1 4. But even though the well-read Cazotte relied heavily on his pre- decessors for his thematic and stylistic inspiration, he did not try to ride the wave of their success by simply producing more of the same. Instead, as Georges Décote remarks, he used them to distance himself more and more from the traditional literary conventions of his time: S'il ne fait pas de doute ... que Cazotte s'inspire nettement des contes de fées traditionnels dont il garde bien des traits, il est tout aussi évident qu'il prend simultanément ses distances avec eux et que La Patte du chat constitue à la fois une satire et une parodie souriante mais assez vive de ce genre littéraire. (25) [While there is no doubt that Cazotte draws his inspiration from the traditional fairy tale of which he keeps many characteristics, it is equally evident that he distances himself from it and that La Patte du chat constitutes both a satire and a lighthearted yet also sharp parody of this literary genre.] (All translations are mine). In the 30 years between these amusing fairy tales and the more disturbing Le Diable amoureux, Cazotte practiced all kinds of genres and styles. In most of his works, Cazotte mocked, criticized, and parodied popular texts, a prac- tice that earned him a reputation of writing "des badinages" [banter]. The fol- lowing titles attest to the wide range of Cazotte' s literary production in these years and show him to be a man in tune with the taste of his mid-eighteenth century readers: Le Bijou trop peu payé, et la Brunette anglaise, nouvelles en vers (1 764,), La Nouvelle Raméide, poème (1766), Le Lord impromptu, nou- velle romanesque (1767), Les Sabots, opéra comique en un acte, mêlé d'ariettes (1768). But by the time he wrote Le Diable amoureux , he had dis- tanced himself enough from the concept of the marvelous to provide his read- ers with a first glimpse at a new literary mode, the fantastic. Any evaluation of Cazotte's work and life requires a look at his involve- ment in the occult sciences that swept through France during the last third of the eighteenth century when figures like Emanuel Swedenborg, Franz Mesmer, Saint-Martin and Cagliostro dominated the conversation in the Pari- sian as well as the provincial Salons. In his article "Mysticism in the Age of Reason: Jacques Cazotte and the Demons," Kenneth J. Fleurant points to a fundamental difference that separated the Swedenborgians and Mesmerists from the Martinists. According to Fleurant, the former were occultists "pri- marily concerned with ontological questions," whereas Cazotte belonged to the school of Martinism, "a mystical strain more interested in ethical prob- lems than in questions of existence" (68-69; my emphasis). Fleurant's distinc- tion between the two "schools" is significant less for the sake of labeling Cazotte than for revealing a crucial element in his writing. Cazotte seemed in- deed less interested in the ontological status of his characters than in establish- ing a relationship between the concepts of ethics and aesthetics, both of which were undergoing dramatic changes throughout the eighteenth century. One of the earlier manifestations of Cazotte's preoccupation with ethics can be found 322 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="4">Markus Muller in the already mentioned Ollivier, poème. While this work is still anchored in the realm of the marvelous, it provides a starting point for my textual analysis as it features, in the midst of the hero's typical light-hearted adventures, sev- eral almost fantastic episodes with serious ethical consequences.2 Ollivier is a sort of troubadour tale or ballad in twelve songs about the ad- ventures of the young knight Ollivier at the time of the Crusades. A vassal of Count Sigismond, Ollivier falls in love with Agnès, the count's beautiful and only daughter. The birth of their illegitimate son causes not only the count's wrath but also that of Ollivier's rival Inare, the son of Sigismond's second wife, who is also in love with Agnès. Ollivier is forced to flee from the count's land and joins the crusaders, which gives the narrator the opportunity to add some exotic flavor to his story. After many years of adventures in foreign countries, Ollivier saves Sigismond's life and is pardoned by him. The story ends happily with Ollivier's and Agnès's marriage. Notwithstanding the overall whimsical nature of this tale, there are nu- merous ethical dilemmas woven into the different subplots of which Ollivier and all the other protagonists are conscious. This is, of course, nothing new as such ethical considerations are also present in the stylistically and themati- cally very similar medieval courtly epics à la Chrétien de Troyes and other genres.3 However, some of these questions are presented in Ollivier in the context of an epistemological doubt regarding the supernatural or natural ori- gin of "evil." If, in fact, evil is of a natural cause, its origin must be located in the human and not in some transcendental figure. Because fantastic literature can achieve its desired effect, according to Todorov, only if the reader adopts the protagonist's point of view, it attracts our attention to the ethical by means of the cognitive hesitation at the level of the aesthetic and therefore can be used as a privileged medium to demystify the numerous myths about the tran- scendental origin of violence. From the beginning of the story, Ollivier, his friends, and his enemies, are confronted with numerous ethically challenging situations that begin with Ollivier's secret love affair with Agnès. Her pregnancy and the birth of their illegitimate son cause Ollivier's flight from the castle of his lord, a serious vi- olation of their lord-vassal relationship. The many ethical dilemmas in this text are not only implicitly present, they are explicitly voiced by the protago- nists themselves. Count Sigismond, for instance, is torn between a call to arms from the emperor and his personal vengeance. Although he is more inclined to pursue Ollivier, he heeds the emperor's call and justifies his decision at length with political arguments. Later in the story, Enguerrand, Ollivier's loyal friend, is held up by a very beautiful and seductive fairy, one of the many pre- decessors of the seductive Biondetta in Le Diable amoureux, who pretends to be in love with him. She prevents Enguerrand from leaving her castle by means of her supernatural powers (that is, her physical charms) in spite of the knight's many pleas to let him go: "Madame... je ressens le prix de l'accueil queje reçois, et celui des plaisirs auxquels je m'arrache; mais mon devoir ..." [Madame. . . I feel the value of this welcome as well as the value of the plea- sures of which I am about to deprive myself; but my duty...] (Ollivier 47).4 In the Arts 323</page><page sequence="5">From Parody to Paradox Like Count Sigismond, Enguerrand is torn between two obligations: on the one hand, he knows that there is a price to pay for the pleasures he received at the lady's castle; on the other, he is aware of the promise to rescue his friend Ollivier. Because one of the elements in this equation appears to be of super- natural origin, Enguerrand does not really know what to do. Unable to make a decision, he turns to the lady and asks her to release him from one of his obli- gations, which she refuses to do. When he decides to leave the castle against her will, she uses her magic powers to retain him. Since the fantastic always requires us to go back and re-read the story from a "disillusioned" perspective and replace the supernatural characters with "real" people, we have to ask ourselves to what degree Enguerrand's story about his being forced to stay at a beautiful woman's place is nothing but an excuse for his failure to rescue Ollivier. These instances of ethical dilemmas resulting in "good" and "bad" decisions are but a prelude to the struggle that the hero Ollivier has to endure. The following episode involves Ollivier himself and supports my argu- ment that Cazotte moved towards an anthropomorphization of evil instead of attributing it to a transcendental cause. After numerous battles and a few su- pernatural adventures, Ollivier encounters a group of monsters and ghost-like figures whose appearance is recounted by the narrator with far more than the usual amount of descriptive detail. The lengthy quote here is necessitated by the detailed description of the supposedly supernatural figure, i.e. the Devil as we know him from numerous fables and fairy tales. This would, of course change in Le Diable amoureux where the Devil's appearance gradually trans- forms from a monstrous animal head into a beautiful woman. But here is Ollivier' s encounter: Un fantôme d'une figure horrible, d'une taille énorme et gigantesque . . . Les chaînes, sous le poids desquelles ce hideux colosse semble succomber, retardent la vitesse de sa marche, que des monstres infernaux hâtent à coups de fouet, dont les bouts sont armées de pointes acérées, et en lui pressant le flanc avec des fourches aiguës. On voit ruisseler le sang partout où les pointes meurtrières ont fait leurs atteintes. Le monstre s'agite, se tourmente, pousse d'affreux rugissements. Sa bouche vomit des tourbillons de flammes qui menacent d'embraser tout ce qui les approche. ( Ollivier 222-3) [A ghost with a horrible face and of a gigantic size . . . The chains under whose weight the hideous colossus seems to succumb slow down his advance. At the same time, infernal monsters hasten the ghost's progress by lashing it with their whips whose ends are armed with sharp points and by poking his flanks with pointed forks. One can see blood stream from the wounds caused by the deadly spikes. The monster shakes, suffers in pain, and howls dreadfully. Its mouth spits out whirls of flames which threaten to set ablaze everyone in their reach]. 324 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="6">Markus Muller Ollivier charges this "troupe infernale" [infernal troops] but not without hav- ing given them a fair warning first. After a violent fight, they retreat from the battlefield. Two creatures lay wounded on the ground, the monster and an- other figure that appears to be a woman. Ollivier does not dare to approach them during the night and keeps wondering until dawn when, with the help of the first sunlight, he assures himself of their human nature: "Aidé de la lumière... le paladin a déjà pris parti sur la nature de la masse et du bloc qui, pendant la nuit, ont été le sujet de son inquiétude. "Ceci, disoit-il, me paroît être un homme, et voilà, si je ne me trompe, une femme"" [With the help of daylight. . . the paladin has made up his mind as to the nature of this mass and this block which, during the previous night, had worried him so much. "This," he said, "seems to be a man and there, if I am not wrong, is a woman"] ( Ollivier 224). Ollivier's waiting is comparable to the hesitation of the protagonist in the fantastic narrative who is uncertain about the supernatural phenomenon's on- tological status. The imminent danger to his life did not allow him to "hesi- tate" much during their first encounter. At the same time, his ethics do not allow him to continue the hostilities until he is sure with whom or what he is dealing. To his great surprise, Ollivier discovers not only that the monster is a human being, he finds his arch-enemy Inare under the mask. The flames too can be explained in natural terms, as they were produced by a piece of burning bitumen. If Ollivier had any pretension to be a fantastic story, it would cease to be one at this very moment according to Todorov's definition of the fantas- tic. With the fantastic phenomenon explained in natural terms, Ollivier would now fall into the category of the uncanny. Even though Ollivier knows that Inare tried everything in the past to kill him, his conscience does not allow him to abandon the wounded adversary: "L'abandonnera-t-il? Ce parti lui semble lâche et cruel tout à la fois." ["Will he abandon him? This option seems both cowardly and cruel to him"](0///v/er 226). Let us not forget that Ollivier is still trying, at this point, to reconcile himself with Sigismond and marry Agnès, who is also the love interest of Inare. It would be easy for him to get rid of his enemy at this point, but he de- cides against it. Put differently, we can say that Ollivier does not try to hide behind the ambiguity of a fantastic phenomenon and use it to justify the kill- ing of a human being. This is precisely the difference between him and his friend Enguerrand. The above mentioned episode is significant because it shows Cazotte's early attempts to work out the question between the supernatural and the natu- ral and its impact on the social behavior of the protagonists. How much Cazotte concerned himself with this problematic is underlined by a statement made by the narrator, who believes it necessary to elaborate on the nature of Ollivier's adventure that he had just told: L'aventure du Pont-au-Diable présentait d'abord bien du merveilleux. Voici tout ce qui en reste. Un homme trouve son plus In the Arts , 325</page><page sequence="7">From Parody to Paradox grand ennemi dans le malheur, et expose ses jours pour le délivrer. Cela est un peu plus rare à rencontrer que des revenans. ( Ollivier 227). [At first sight, the Pont-au-Diable adventure was all about the mar- velous. But this is what it is all about. A man finds his greatest en- emy struck down by misfortune and risks his life to help him. Such a behavior is a little bit harder to find than some ghosts.] In order to comprehend the significance of this unexpected intervention of the third-person narrator and his démystification of the marvelous, we have to compare it once more to Enguerrand's encounter with the fairy. Here, Enguerrand's scruples about his extended stay at the fairy's castle and ulti- mate failure to rescue Ollivier do not entail any explicit comment from the narrator regarding the supernatural nature of the event. Instead, it is Enguerrand's servant Barin who assumes the role of his master's critic and so- cial conscience. He seems to see through the fairy's plot when he says: "Ce grand amour qu'on vous porte, ce qu'on dit ici, ce qu'on y fait, me paroissent des songes dont j'appréhende beaucoup le réveil." ["This great love that they show for you, and what they say and do around here seem to be dreams from which I fear to wake up."] {Ollivier 49). Barin's "wisdom" is that of Don Qui- xote's servant Sancho Panza and quixotic elements appear several times throughout this episode but are particularly obvious at the end when Enguerrand and Barin are overpowered by a handful of women: Ses [Enguerrand's] habits volent de toutes parts en lambeaux; l'air s'obscurcit des plumes qu'il arrache par touffes à ses adversaires, partout où son poignet nerveux peut s'accrocher; l'appartement retentit de rires forcés, de cris de femmes, et d'imprécations militaires. Enguerrand se défendoit bien; mais le combat étoit trop inégal. Après une résistance digne de son courage, le paladin, mis à nu, renversé sur le parquet, est frotté, de la tête aux pieds, de la drogue fatale. Enfin on le laisse privé de sentiment, à côté de son fidèle écuyer, qui, après s 'être fait donner quelques coups de griffes en essayant de se défendre, s'étoit laissé déshabiller et frotter avec toute la patience du monde. ( Ollivier 54) [His [Enguerrand's] clothes flew in pieces in all directions; the room is darkened by the feathers which he tears from his adversar- ies' bodies wherever his nervous fist can find a hold; forced laugh- ter, women's cries, and military imprecations resound throughout the room. Enguerrand defended himself well but the fight was too uneven. After a resistance worthy of his courage, the paladin, lying naked on the floor, was rubbed from head to toe with the fatal lo- tion. Finally, they leave him unconscious next to his faithful horse- man who, after attempting to defend himself and receiving a few scratches, let himself be undressed and rubbed with the greatest pa- tience in the world.] 326 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="8">Markus Muller Cazotte's narrator might mock the mighty warrior Enguerrand and ulti- mately treats the matter of the "merveilleux" [marvelous] as a lighthearted farce. But in contrast to the above-mentioned Ollivier episode, the narrator in no way challenges or problematizes the concept of the supernatural. Its seri- ous ethical implications are drowned in comedy, and at this point the reader has forgotten Enguerrand' s moral dilemma. In fact, and this cannot be over- emphasized, the alleged supernatural intervention must be interpreted as an excuse for Enguerrand's failure to comply with his promise to help Ollivier. The reader, however, is quickly reminded that there still is one "real" problem in Ollivier as the next chapter literally opens with the name Inare, Ollivier's mortal enemy. The Pont-au-Diable adventure is in principle the same as the episode at the fairy's castle with the exception that the stakes are much higher. Ollivier is in a position to kill his enemy but consciously chooses not to do so. Instead he makes an "enlightened" and consequently also an ethically correct choice: he literally waits for the light of day to investigate the seemingly supernatural phenomenon. In both episodes the narrator implicitly or explicitly comments on the protagonists' behavior and provides us with an insight into his attitude towards the supernatural and the importance of the narrator's role for fantastic narratives. Whereas we tend to follow the third-person narrator's attitude to- wards the supernatural because of the distance between him and the protago- nists, his status becomes significantly more complex and ultimately also more suspicious in those first-person narratives where he is both protagonist and storyteller. Even if we do not go as far as Tobin Siebers whose reading of Mérimée's fantastic short stories "La Vénus d'llle" and "Lokis" suggests that the respective narrators should be counted among the possible suspects for the murders in both stories, we nevertheless have to pay close attention to the de- velopment of this powerful position not only in the fantastic but in fiction in general. As far as Cazotte's attitude towards the marvelous is concerned, the treatment of the two episodes shows that he distanced himself significantly from the satirical, i.e. aesthetical, approach to the marvelous and instead fo- cused on its ethical implications. If the fantastic is, as I have suggested, also a comment on its historical and social environment by the manner in which it "solves" its inherent paradox, the outcome of Ollivier's adventure is in fact surprisingly harmless consider- ing the development of fantastic literature in the nineteenth century, where the encounter with a fantastic event or phenomenon would lead to increasingly violent results. In the early 1760s, while writing Ollivier, Cazotte may have had his doubts about the cultural and especially the moral development in France; however, his world view had not been completely shattered, as the generally optimistic endings of his early works show. As he grew older, Cazotte would become less optimistic. The genesis of Le Diable amoureux with its three different endings illustrates Cazotte's struggle with both aes- thetic and ethical questions. Like most fantastic narratives, the story of Alvaro and Biondetta in Le Di- able amoureux begins rather innocently. Inspired by an older mentor, who In the Arts 327</page><page sequence="9">From Parody to Paradox seems to have supernatural powers, Alvaro too desires to gain power over the spiritual world. The mentor, a certain Soberano, grants this wish and Alvaro and a couple of friends meet in the ruins of Portici where Alvaro indeed sum- mons the Devil and then orders him to prepare a lavish feast for his friends. Transforming into a beautiful page by the name of Biondetto, the Devil grants this wish. When the party is over, Alvaro wants to terminate this "relation- ship" with the Devil, but just like the sorcerer's apprentice, he is unable to do so. What seems to be even more unsettling for Alvaro is that the page turns out to be a lovely young woman who expresses a passionate love for him. She re- fuses to leave and follows him to his quarters. To avoid any disciplinary prob- lems - Alvaro is at this point still an officer in the army of the King of Naples - they flee to the more modern and liberal Republic of Venice. Alvaro is torn between his adherence to his mother's catholic morals which prevent him from having an affair with the Devil/Biondetta and his ob- vious desire to engage in a serious relationship with this forbidden object of desire. The problem is aggravated by the fact that Alvaro is seemingly unable to come to a conclusion as to the ontological status of Biondetta and all his at- tempts to divert his desires toward other women fail. In the end, he decides to return to his mother's castle and ask for her permission to marry Biondetta. After a series of accidents and delays, the two reach Spain and spend the night at a farm where a wedding takes place. It is during this night that Alvaro sup- posedly loses his fight with the temptress Biondetta and sleeps with her. The next morning, Biondetta has disappeared and Alvaro returns home without her. His mother and her counselor "enlighten" him as to the true nature of Biondetta and advise him to marry a woman of his mother's choice. Alvaro is, in essence, a protagonist who does not change throughout the novel, and in this he differs from many a character in eighteenth century liter- ature. He is not yet so modern that he would doubt the existence of the Devil altogether; the idea of the marvelous is still a part of his thinking. What throws him off, however, is the Devil's unfamiliar, or unheimliche, aesthetic appear- ance, which provokes the already mentioned Todorovian "hesitation." Cazotte does not allow his protagonist to go so far as to change and become the master of his desire. All Alvaro can do is voice his own desires and make a feeble attempt at fleeing the influence of his mother. In the end, he capitulates and returns to her home where he is reintegrated into society according to her norms and her desires. This cannot be said about the novel's other main pro- tagonist who changes drastically over the course of the novel. The Devil alters his shape several times: from camel head to dog, from dog to male servant, then to female singer, and finally to the very seductive female page, Biondetta. All the protagonists move through different social and political en- vironments: Alvaro, brought up in the kingdom of Spain, becomes an officer in the kingdom of Naples. He and Biondetta flee together to the republic of Venice and ultimately return to Spain. Put differently, Alvaro is confronted with both a changing environment and a constantly changing love interest. Because of his infatuation with the beautiful and forbidden Biondetta, his at- tention to the different social environments with their specific rules of con- 328 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="10">Markus Muller duct is weakened, disturbed, or completely dormant. In other words, the master Alvaro can only survive thanks to his servant Biondetta who manages their travels and Alvaro's business affairs. What makes matters even more difficult for him is that Biondetta is not confined to the role of a passive object of desire any longer (as he had wished for when he summoned the Devil in the first place). On the contrary, she be- comes involved in a way that is uncharacteristic for the Devil in all literature up to Le Diable amoureux. In this novel it is the Devil that falls in love, and Biondetta's desire for Alvaro makes her the dominant player until, of course, they get too close to Alvaro's mother's home. In fact, it is she who pushes the plot whereas her male counterpart Alvaro, once his initial bravery is over, tries to keep things at a certain status quo which is, as in the case of the sor- cerer's apprentice, impossible. Biondetta quickly recognizes Alvaro's almost total obedience to the rigid morals of his mother and tries to use this discovery to her advantage, Alvaro's behavior is characterized by his inability to recog- nize and adapt to the "set of norms [ethics] that regulate human interaction in specific societies" (Gans 46) and therefore does not allow him to react prop- erly to Biondetta's challenge.5 To be sure, Alvaro does not question his own ontological status. As a character whose morals are firmly rooted in the classical world, in which he later seeks refuge, he does not see the need to question his own identity and values, a fact that can be interpreted either as his undoing because he cannot adapt to a new world or as his salvation because it saves him at the end of the novel. Alvaro is, at best, a pre-romantic hero whose desire to be Faust almost gets the better of him but who has sense enough to return to his mother's home when he realizes that he is no longer capable of managing his desires. His at- tempt to liberate himself from a parental generation that used to dictate his de- sires and find his own is ultimately a failure. The problems inherent in the transformation of absolute morals into a his- torically and socially specific ethical conduct in Le Diable amoureux are brought to the fore through the introduction of the fantastic phenomenon. Alvaro's problem is mostly one of timing as he is either behind, due to his strong bind to the classical world through his mother, or ahead of his contem- poraries because he is driven by a pre-romantic desire to be different and thus original. The paradoxical nature of his situation is made visible by his con- stant oscillation between the two female figures in the novel who symbolize the old and the new world. Too weak to resolve these complex problems him- self, Alvaro ultimately needs to seek help from his parents. In contrast to Alvaro, the Devil is presented in Le Diable amoureux as in tune with his time. The Devil has learned, so to speak, to adapt his traditional and easily recognizable appearance to the requirements of a new age. From a physically and morally repulsive (animal-like) figure that would make it rela- tively easy for the protagonists to reject it, the Devil has changed his shape to a desirable (human) form. Instead of tempting his victims with easy to satisfy sexual passion, the Devil now uses the more complex concepts of love and de- sire, the latter of which cannot, by definition, be satisfied, for the purpose of In the Arts 329</page><page sequence="11">From Parody to Paradox reaching his goals.6 The anthropomorphization of evil leads to a serious di- lemma for the protagonist in situations where he is required to distance him- self from the person that incarnates evil. Instead of killing some sort of supernatural phenomenon or an animal, he is now liable to kill a human being. Although Alvaro himself never has to face such a dilemma, one of his prede- cessors, Ollivier, comes close to killing a human who initially presents him- self in guise of an evil monster. This shift from a transcendental origin of evil to an "anthropomorphic exteriorization of this evil principle in psychologi- cally real forms became one of Cazotte's most lasting contributions to litera- ture" writes Fleurant (75). That Cazotte contemplated three different endings to his novel is highly revelatory in regard to the uncertainty regarding the shifting aesthetic and eth- ical paradigms of the time and the author's personal struggle with this devel- opment. According to the Epilogue to the 1 776 edition of Le Diable amoureux in the first (non-published) version, Cazotte intended to disregard all literary and moral conventions of the time and let the Devil prevail over Alvaro. Be- cause friends to whom Cazotte had told the story did not like such an immoral ending, his second version (the first one to be published) ends with Alvaro managing to liberate himself from the forces of evil. This time, it was the readers of this first published version who did not find the ending very credi- ble: they judged the denouement to be "trop brusque" [too abrupt] (Décote 248). In the third and final version, Cazotte then settles for what one could call a compromise between the two preceding ones: neither the Devil nor Alvaro can claim a complete victory. The question who finally wins the battle, the Devil or Alvaro, remains forever deferred as it is Alvaro's mother and her counselor who impose a so- lution on the problem without really solving it. In a paradoxical move, they dismiss Alvaro's story as a series of dreams on the one hand, yet on the other, they acknowledge the existence of the Devil and his attempt to lure the young protagonist Alvaro into the dangerous world of desire. Their solution to the problem is artificial in the sense that they determine what Alvaro should de- sire: marriage and a wife chosen not by him but by his mother. By simply sat- isfying what they presume is the young man's desire, i.e. to find a wife, they hope to take the Devil (desire) by its horns and break them off. Hence the counselor's name Don Quebracuernos [breaker of horns].7 Because the mother and her counselor deal with the problem of the Devil from the per- spective of their own traditional values, they assume that Alvaro's problem is simply a question of unsatisfied physical appetite or, in other words, passion. The novel then ends with the counselor's recommendation regarding Alvaro's future life, hoping that the young man will not be tempted any more by immoral passions: Croyez-moi, formez des liens légitimes avec une personne du sexe; que votre respectable mère préside à votre choix: et dût celle que vous tiendrez de sa main avoir des grâces et des talents célestes, vous ne serezjamais tenté de la prendre pour le Diable ( Diable 376) 330 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="12">Markus Muller [Follow my advice, seek a legitimate relationship with a woman and let your mother preside over your choice. And if the woman whom you will receive from your mother's hand has grace and faith, you will never again be tempted to mistake her for the Devil] This recommendation is reported as direct discourse and without any further comment from Alvaro or the narrator. The counselor's strategy might prove successful as far as Alvaro's passions are concerned; however, the question as to whether the proposed solution really puts an end to his desire remains un- comfortably open. This Außiebung of the fantastic event by the doctor and Alvaro's mother can be considered progress insofar as their immediate personal situation is concerned: for Alvaro, because he now appears to be able to continue with his life; for the mother and the doctor, because they have imposed their traditional set of values on him. Considered from a historical perspective, the Außiebung of the fantastic event is, however, not a step forward but an attempt to consoli- date the values of pre-Enlightenment Europe and to provide some kind of guidance for young Alvaro. He is educated and wealthy and follows the life- style of his contemporaries. Confronted with a relatively strange modern world in Venice, where all his values are turned upside down, Alvaro ex- presses the uncertainty of a man who finds himself in the middle of a histori- cal change which, in this case, centers on sociological and economical issues. The explanation at the end of the story thus reflects a conscious choice by the author, who has his hero, instead of making the leap into the new world order, return to the protection of the old social hierarchy. Notwithstanding this somewhat reassuring albeit superficial solution to Alvaro's problem, which seems to fit Cazotte's own conservative inclinations as well as his contemporaries' taste for a morally acceptable ending of the novel, the protagonist's epistemological and ontological doubts have been presented in a new way in Le Diable amoureux. As naïve and ignorant of the world as Candide, Alvaro sets out to establish his own identity and to have his "own" desires, thus falling into the trap of what René Girard called the mensonge romantique [romantic lie]. Alvaro believes that there is such a thing as a desire ex nihilo and is no longer satisfied with the constellation of a world in which his desires are always already determined by somebody else. With the exception of the fantastic element presented by the Devil, Alvaro's and Biondetta's situation is not uncommon in eighteenth-century lit- erature and may be compared, for instance, to that of Prévosťs Chevalier des Grieux and Manon Lescaut. Just like des Grieux, Alvaro is torn between a world of old-fashioned values and the new world (in Prévosťs novel, des Grieux literally travels to the New World) with its different economic and so- cial structures. Manon Lescaut, published in the first third of the century, jux- taposes des Grieux, a man of passion, and the beautiful Manon who incarnates the dangers inherent in mediated desire. Although it is quite possible that the parents and friends of des Grieux, and in particular his friend Tiberge who represents the old world in this novel, consider Manon as some kind of Devil In the Arts 331</page><page sequence="13">From Parody to Paradox in disguise because of her noxious influence not only on des Grieux but on all men, her exclusion from society is not explained in such terms. This is, how- ever, the problem at the root of the relationship between Alvaro and Biondetta in Le Diable amoureux. In both novels, the women as the central and danger- ous objects of desire "disappear" at the end. Although Manon dies of nonvio- lent causes in the American wilderness, her death is ultimately a version of the ritualistic scapegoating mechanism through which a society channels an all-threatening violence on one victim and thus prevents the destruction of the social order itself. If we disregard for a moment any contemplation of Biondetta as a supernatural evil being, but consider her simply as a woman in love with Alvaro, her sudden disappearance at the end is more than suspi- cious. Why and under what circumstances did she disappear? And if she was a real woman, what reasons compelled Alvaro to cloak her existence in super- natural terms? The answer to these questions is crucial to my interpretation of the fantastic, and I will need to return to it later. Alvaro's apprenticeship in matters of desire, love, and new social orders begins when he is a young officer in the service of the King of Naples, a social and political order familiar to his Spanish noble background. He leads the typ- ical life of a young eighteenth-century noble officer: "nous vivions beaucoup entre camarades, et comme des jeunes gens, c'est-à-dire des femmes, du jeu, tant que la bourse pouvait y suffire, et nous philosophions dans nos quartiers quand nous n'avions plus d'autre ressource" [we spent our time with friends and lived like young men. By this I mean women and gambling as much as we could afford. And when we ran out of money, we would philosophize in our quarters] {Diable 3 1 5). His psychological profile is, with the exception of a burning desire to distinguish himself from his peers, that of a rather naive young man with an extremely strong feeling of respect and obedience towards his mother. This quote is significant because of its reference to women. I will return to the crucial question whether Alvaro actually succumbs to the erotic advances of the Devil (Biondetta) at the end of his story, but already at this point, it is important to note that Alvaro must have had some sexual relationships prior to his encounter with Biondetta: "c'est-à-dire des femmes" cannot be inter- preted otherwise given the context and the time period of the novel. Aside from the fact that it evacuates some of the arguments regarding his "morals," since Alvaro is not as innocent as some like to see him, it also directs our at- tention towards the novel's real issue which is the concept of desire. Because Alvaro desires Biondetta as much as she desires him, they are both desiring subjects and objects at the same time. Their desire for each other is, however, not a direct one. Instead, it is mediated by the morals of the classical world represented by Alvaro's mother and her counselor. Alvaro and Biondetta act either in compliance with or against these morals.8 The quote cited above also explains why Alvaro is not satisfied by the tra- ditional pleasures of his time such as the occasional flirtation with women, gambling, drinking and the philosophical discussions with his friends. The first person plural "nous" and the imperfect used to describe these activities 332 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="14">Markus Muller point to their basic flaw: they are the ordinary and habitual or "ritual" activi- ties of young eighteenth-century men. But due to his romantic inclinations, Alvaro wants to distinguish himself from the rest of his friends whom he hith- erto used to imitate. His only remaining "passion" is thus his curiosity for some unknown yet personalized desire: "La curiosité est ma plus forte pas- sion. Je vous avouerai que naturellement j'ai peu d'empressement pour nos connaissances ordinaires; elles m'ont toujours semblé trop bornées, et j'ai deviné cette sphère élevée dans laquelle vous voulez m'aider à m'élancer" [Curiosity is my strongest passion. I will admit that I show very little natural interest in our ordinary knowledge. They have always appeared too limited to me and I have sensed this elevated sphere to which I want to rise with your help] ( Diable 316). Alvaro tries to distinguish himself by voicing his own de- sire, vague or unknown as it might be. In addition, his comment must be un- derstood as a critique of Enlightenment ideas ("nos connaissances ordinaires"); the only, and also most fashionable, way to rise to new spheres is by means of the occult sciences. But this move turns Alvaro into a protagonist living between two worlds. His code of honor, his relatively strong moral convictions, and an unchal- lenged respect for his parents' generation mark him as a man of classical stat- ure. The new "world" is, however, different from the harmless world of fables, marvels and wishes granted by benevolent fairies. It is the world of commerce, negotiations and contracts. Anything can be desired, but every- thing has a price (literal or figurative).9 Hence his constant struggle with fi- nancial problems in Venice, where he loses large amounts of money playing cards, and his total ignorance of human interactions that are not based on so- cial hierarchy alone but subject to negotiation. Alvaro, for instance, does not understand that women of all ages and social ranks actively flirt with him in- stead of waiting to be courted. His ultimate failure is therefore the result of a combination of his unbridled desire ("Je le veux, je le veux" [I want it, I want it] or "Vous ne pouvez concevoir le désir que vous avez créé dans moi: il me brûle" [You cannot understand the desire that you have created in me: it de- vours me] ( Diable 317)) and the fact that he is unaware of the dangers in- volved in his stepping outside of his accustomed circle. This happens, of course, in the most literal sense when Alvaro steps outside the protective cir- cle drawn in the sand at the ruins of Portici. It is clear that the Devil is the (allegorical) figure representing this danger, and we have to ask ourselves how Alvaro's relationship with the Devil differs from any previous similar literary models.10 If we return to the beginning of the novel, we realize that Alvaro's troubles are magnified by the fact that in- stead of portraying the Devil (desire) in the traditional fashion of the eigh- teenth century, Cazotte attributes new intellectual and physical qualities to the Devil that must be unfamiliar to the typical eighteenth-century protagonist. At first, Cazotte keeps the conventional description of the Devil as some hideous animal, the only change here being the exotic touch offered by the camel head. The usual markers such as hoofs, horns, wings, a tail, etc., are replaced by enormous ears. But the Devil subsequently undergoes a significant and In the Arts 333</page><page sequence="15">From Parody to Paradox disturbing series of metamorphoses as he gradually acquires human features: from the hideous camel head, he metamorphoses into a cute (and female) spaniel, then into a servant with androgynous features, then into a female singer, and finally into the beautiful woman Biondetta. But a camel, as exotic as it might be, a dog and a beautiful woman are in themselves nothing unfa- miliar. On the contrary, Cazotte does everything to present the Devil in the most non-threatening, inferior, or servant-like characters (dog, servant, woman). Cazotte understands that this is precisely what creates the fantastic and its danger for Alvaro, who might be able to recognize the usual allegories of evil but is not capable of seeing through the deceptive nature of these new versions. His "misreading" of the hitherto unproblematic signifiers 'dog,' 'servant' and 'woman' leads to his confusion. Another crucial feature of the Devil is his lack of physical handicaps. Ear- lier stereotypical representations of the Devil differ from Cazotte's version that presents him in the form of an attractive woman.11 The new image of the Devil is acknowledged at the end of the novel by the counselor Quebracuernos, who clearly distinguishes Alvaro's version of the Devil from earlier literary models: Votre aventure est bien extraordinaire; je n'ai rien lu de semblable dans la Dimonomanie de Bodin, ni dans le Monde enchanté de Bekker. Et il faut convenir que depuis ces grands hommes ont écrit, notre ennemi s'est prodigieusement raffiné sur la manière de for- mer ses attaques, en profitant des ruses que les hommes du siècle emploient réciproquement pour se corrompre. Il copie la nature fidèlement et avec choix, il emploie la ressource des talents aimables, donne des fêtes bien entendues, fait parler aux passions leur plus séduisant langage; il imite même jusqu'à un certain point la vertu. ( Diable 375) [Your adventure is rather extraordinary. I have not seen anything like it either in the Dimonomanie by Bodin or in the Monde enchanté by Bekker. And I have to admit that our enemy, since the time of these great writers, has refined himself prodigiously in the manner he plans his attacks and by profiting from the ruses that men of our own century use to corrupt each other. He faithfully and deliberately copies nature, he uses pleasant talents, gives elaborate parties, and lets passion express itself in the most seductive lan- guage. He even imitates virtue to a certain degree] Quebracuernos' s characterization of the Devil points to the most important el- ement regarding the anthropomorphization of the Devil: not only does he alter his physical appearance from an animal to a beautiful woman (Biondetta), the Devil also imitates human behavior and culture to such a degree that he be- comes literally indistinguishable from other human beings. That the concept of mimesis, in the sense of imitation, also reigns in the world of the supernatu- ral and determines Biondetta's relationship to Alvaro is an important element 334 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="16">Markus Muller of our interpretation of the fantastic and will be discussed in a moment.12 At this point it is more important to push the discussion of the Devil's anthropomorphization to its completion by assuming that Biondetta is in fact a human being. If this is true, her sudden and unexplained disappearance at the end of the novel will require an explanation. In The Romantic Fantastic, Tobin Siebers convincingly shows how the attribution of a signum diaboli to a designated victim marks it as a supernatu- ral being whereas, in fact, "the actual difference between the so-called witch and her persecutors is minimal, cannot be held responsible for the accusation, and springs from a complex mythology created by the persecutors in order to conceal and excuse their actions" (41). From this perspective, the relationship between Alvaro and Biondetta takes on a completely new dimension; and the story itself would become, as Siebers argues in the case of Mérimée' s "La Vénus d'Ille" or "Lokis", a narrative whose sole purpose is to cover up a vio- lent act by means of the fantastic phenomenon. Before I can deal with this problem, it will be necessary to further analyze Alvaro's and Biondetta's rela- tionship. Alvaro's desire to set himself apart from his peers, although it appears to be an act of his own creation, is but a simple act of imitation. Soberano seems to have control over the world of spirits and titillates Alvaro's imagination with a demonstration of his power. The effect on Alvaro is instantaneous: "Je me retirai plein de curiosité et affamé d'idées nouvelles..." [I left his house filled with curiosity and starving for new ideas...] ( Diable 317). Contrary to traditional fairy tales, where the protagonist would express a concrete wish, Alvaro has, aside from his general desire "d'être en commerce" with the spiri- tual world, no clear idea what to do once this wish is granted to him. 13 At first, he is at a loss of words when the camel head asks him "Che vuoi" [What do you want] but then decides to test its actual power and have it metamorphose into some more manageable form.14 Consequently, Alvaro asks the camel to change into a dog, a wish that demonstrates how much Alvaro is still impris- oned in traditional thinking. What he wants is an obedient and unproblematic servant, a sort of genie, whose sole purpose is to serve his master.15 Thus, what Alvaro hopes to gain, at his point, is a means that would allow him to sat- isfy any appetite, wish, or passion that he might have in the future. What seems to be a move of empowerment by Alvaro turns out to be the first step towards his defeat. The obvious master-slave dialectic of the rela- tionship which develops instantly between the Devil and Alvaro will work in favor of the slave, who is aware of the power of his or, in our case, Biondetta's supposedly inferior position and the master's dependence on the slave's work. The gesture of submission, the dog's rolling on its back, could not be stronger and has the desired effect on Alvaro: "Ma confiance était montée jusqu'à l'audace" [My confidence turned into audacity] (. Diable 320). He for- gets Soberano' s warnings and leaves the circle that has hitherto protected him from the advances of the Devil. Because the slave is closer to the world (real- ity) surrounding him as a result of his work for the master, he is also more apt to survive in this world. This is precisely the position of Biondetta, who uses In the Arts 335</page><page sequence="17">From Parody to Paradox her implicit superiority over Alvaro to lead him into an ever growing mone- tary and, more importantly, moral dependence on her. In addition to her supe- riority in matters of finance, Bionde tta also knows how to use Alvaro's moral standards to her advantage. When he tries to throw her out of his room, she plays the damsel in distress, an act that automatically provokes the desired re- action from Alvaro. His obedience to a restrictive set of absolute morals and his inability to react appropriately to the presence of a woman, who is after all the product of his volition and desire, prevent Alvaro from ever realizing that it is in fact he who is the inferior party in their relationship. When the camel asks him why it should obey him, Alvaro replies with an- other question: "L'esclave, lui dis-je, cherche-t-il à effrayer son maître?" [I said: "Does the slave try to scare his master?"] {Diable 320). Once Alvaro be- lieves he has the upper hand, their relationship becomes for him a matter of a fixed hierarchy which the Devil, on the other hand, always wants to renegoti- ate. In other words, human relationships are defined vertically for Alvaro in relation to a pre-set higher (or metaphysical) standard. Desire on the other hand does not operate on such a premise; instead it needs the horizontality of human interaction for its proper fiinctioning. The following dialogue between the dog and Alvaro demonstrates their different attitudes in regard to this fun- damental matter: - J'obéirai, maître, mais sous quelle condition?. . . - Sous celle d'obéir, esclave. Obéis, sans réplique ou ... - Vous ne me connaissez pas, maître; vous me traiteriez avec moins de rigueur, j'y mettrais peut-être l'unique condition de vous désarmer et de vous plaire. (. Diable 320-1) [- 1 will obey, Master, but under what condition?... - Simply obey, slave. Obey, without argument or. . . - You do not know me, Master. You would treat me less harshly and my only condition would be to disarm and to please you] Throughout the novel, Alvaro seems to forget that he has made, in fact, some sort of Faustian pact with the Devil through the mediator Soberano. When the latter finally agrees to initiate Alvaro in spite of his warnings about the dangers of an unprepared dealing with these forces, he asks him what he would do to the Devil. Alvaro answers, once again, in the fashion of a man who trusts his superiority: "Je tirerais les oreilles au grand Diable d'enfer" [I would pull the great Devil's ears] {Diable 3 1 7). To Alvaro, the whole affair is nothing but a mimetically generated challenge, a question of courage and honor. Soberano later reminds Alvaro of his promise just before Alvaro evokes the Devil: "Récitez... cette conjuration avec fermeté et appelez ensuite à trois fois clairement Béelzébuth, et surtout n 'oubliez pas ce que vous avez promis de faire " [Recite firmly... this conjuration and afterwards say Beelzebub three times. And most importantly, do not forget what you prom- ised to do] {Diable 318; my emphasis). The irony of Alvaro's failure is that the Devil gives him plenty of reminders of his promise and opportunities to 336 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="18">Markus Muller fulfill it. The camel head, the Devil's first worldly incarnation, has overly large ears. Then a terrible noise hurts Alvaro's ears. The camel head, upon Alvaro's request, metamorphoses into a little spaniel with "oreilles traînantes jusqu'à terre" [ears down to the floor] ( Diable 320). At this point, Alvaro makes a haphazard attempt to pull the dog's ears, but it deflects his move by means of the already mentioned gesture of submission. After Biondetta has convinced Alvaro to leave the kingdom of Naples, the protagonists enter a new social order in the republic of Venice. The reversal of hierarchies is further emphasized as they reach their new home during the car- nival. Alvaro finds out very quickly that this new world in no way resembles the one he had just left behind. The trip to Venice is for Alvaro first of all an attempt to escape from his unresolved and troublesome relationship with Biondetta, who manipulates him at will. Alvaro's first idea is to indulge again in old-fashioned passions, but he realizes that they no longer provide him with the desired relief; and the more he tries to escape from the one woman who loves him, the more he is reminded of her: "Je détournais les yeux pour ne pas le voir où il était, et le voyais partout où il n'était pas" [I looked away not to see him where he was and I saw him everywhere where he was not] (Diable 337).17 Even Alvaro's romance with Olympia, a beautiful courtesan, becomes a reminder of the basic distinction between passion and desire: "Notre liaison commença brusquement, et comme j'y trouvais peu de charmes, je jugeai qu'elle finirait de même. . . d'autant plus que nous nous étions pris sur le pied de la passion la plus désintéressée" [Our relationship began suddenly and be- cause I found that it was without charms I thought it would end the same way... even more so because we were both caught up in the most indifferent passion] (Diable 338). 18 The short love affair with Olympia not only reveals that Alvaro has moved beyond simple passions; it also shows Cazotte's un- derstanding of the basic functioning of mediated desire and its inherent dan- gers. Furthermore, Cazotte clearly links this form of desire to the new social order in Venice. We already know that the old-fashioned Alvaro has difficul- ties in adjusting to the relatively modern lifestyle in Venice. That a relation- ship with a woman is more than a simple matter of physical pleasure is, even at this point, beyond his comprehension, yet he has a notion that these "new" relationships are subject to a different law. It disturbs Alvaro profoundly that Olympia' s "jealousy," his term for mediated desire, is directed against all women instead of only the one that still occupies his mind: "Une jalousie, qui n'avait pas encore trouvé d'objet, s'en prenait à toutes les femmes qui pouvaient attirer mes regards ... Je me déplaisais dans ce tourment presque perpétuel; mais il fallait bien y vivre. Je cherchais de bonne foi à aimer Olym- pia, pour aimer quelque chose, et me distraire du goût dangereux que je me connaissais; cependant une scène plus vive se préparait" [A jealousy which had not yet found its target directed itself against all women who could attract my interest. . .1 did not like this almost perpetual torment but I had to live with it. I really tried to love Olympia simply to love something and to distract my- In the Arts 337</page><page sequence="19">From Parody to Paradox self from the dangerous inclination I had. However, a more lively scene was imminent] {Diable 338). This "scène" is literally the classic scene of triangular desire involving Alvaro, Biondetta, and Olympia and it shows how the desire of all three pro- tagonists is always mediated by somebody else. It also reveals how this leads to a breakdown in moral order, most frequently manifested in the form of physical violence, when the desire of two subjects converge on one and the same object. Olympia, for instance, accuses Alvaro of being in love with Biondetta which he, of course, denies as he has done so many times before: "Je vous donne ma parole d'honneur que ce n'est pas une femme" [I swear that it is not a woman] ( Diable 33 8).19 The following remark by Olympia about Alvaro demonstrates how his ethical misconduct brings about a Signifi- cant reversal in regard to who is the actual "monster": "Que veulent dire ces mensonges. . ., monstre? Renvoie-la, te dis je ... je te démasquerai"fwhat do these lies mean..., monster ? Send her [Biondetta] back, I tell yöu .... I will expose you] (. Diable 339). The reversal here is significant, a^ Olympia sees the monster in Alvaro and not in Biondetta whose ontological status is of no interest to her. She sees only another woman, a rival, in Biondetta and judges her according to her social "function" and not her "status." Because Biondetta is conscious of the functioning of mediated desire, she would also use it in a last attempt to bind Alvaro to her. In his article "The Se- ductive Satan of Cazotte's Le Diable amoureux ," Laurence M. Porter argues that Biondetta tries to lure Alvaro to the decadent city of Paris where she could put the final touch to her corruption. From our perspective, this argu- ment cannot be sustained, since we have established that Alvaro's moral pu- rity or impurity in sexual matters is not the problem of this novel. More importantly, however, Biondetta knows better than to risk the exposure of her lover to the many rival women in Paris at a point where he is ready to ask his mother for permission to marry her. Biondetta therefore only needs to allude to the possibility of another Venetian experience to make Alvaro leave imme- diately for his mother's home. Before they reach Estramadura, an accident obliges them to spend the night on an isolated farm where a wedding ceremony is about to start when the two travelers arrive. Excited by the ceremony, the happiness of the couple, the dance, and also the wine, Biondetta makes what most critics consider her final and successful attempt to seduce Alvaro. With the exception of Franc Schuerewegen, most critics argue that Biondetta actually achieves her goal because of a series of suspension points following a scene which describes Alvaro lying on top of Biondetta and her subsequent "O mon Alvaro ... j'ai triomphé: je suis le plus heureux de tous les êtres." [Oh my Alvaro ... I have triumphed: I am the happiest of all beings] (j Diable 369).20 Franc Schuerewegen is right to point out the flaws in the argument of those critics who want to consider Alvaro's seduction as a fait accompli and thus would make morals the central focus of this story. One of the main coun- ter-arguments is that the lovers get ready for bed and undress after the above-mentioned scene. In addition it is necessary to point out that although 338 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="20">Markus Muller suspension points are the conventional linguistic tool to suggest a sexual act, Cazotte does not limit himself to the also conventional three or four suspen- sion points. Instead, he inserts two full lines. Given our knowledge of Cazotte's taste for parodying literary conventions, this hyperbolic use of sus- pension points empties, so to speak, their effect to such a degree that it is at least questionable that they mean what they were hitherto meant to indicate. And how do we have to interpret Biondetta's comment "Ai-je fait ... le bonheur de mon Alvaro? Mais non, je suis encore la seule heureuse" [Have I made ... the happiness of my Alvaro? But no, I am still the only happy one] (Diable 369) or the fact that the Devil, after appearing once again in the shape of the camel head, launches the same terrible "Che vuoi?" at Alvaro. All these points combined lead Schuerwegen to the conclusion that the "diable est obligé de renouveler sa demande parce qu'il n'a toujours pas su triompher d'Alvaro" [Devil is obliged to restate his demand because he still did not know how to seduce Alvaro] (58). It is possible to further erode the argument of Alvaro's "surrender" to the Devil if we approach the problematic from the perspective of the concept of desire. I have pointed out at the beginning of this chapter that the Devil's novel characteristic in Le Diable amoureux is his incarnation of desire instead of passion. Desire is, by definition, only desire as long as it remains unsatis- fied. For this very reason, I argue that the Devil does not want to satisfy and therefore kill Alvaro's desire. Hence his renewed question "Che vuoi." Even though the issue cannot be resolved given the ambiguity of Cazotte's style, it nevertheless has the desired effect of creating another hesi- tation, this time at the level of the function of language and literature. Todorov is right when he asserts that the protagonist's hesitation "occupies us only for a moment" (27). What he misses is the fact that this hesitation is the cause of a much more significant "hesitation" at the level of the protagonist's ethics. Put differently, the hesitation caused by the fantastic is a tool that allows us to de- mystify not only the myth of a transcendental origin of the Devil (violence), it also points to the problematic nature of the fictitious in general and its attempt to manipulate or define what "reality" has to look like. In the end, one has to ask what is so special about Biondetta that Alvaro cannot reveal her true identity. Why cloak her identity in supernatural terms? These last questions lead directly to Tobin Siebers' study and the problem of violence revealed by the fantastic. Since we must be suspicious about Alvaro's trustworthiness as the narrator of a story whose only "witness" he is, the question about Biondetta's fate resurfaces in a completely different light. Why did she disappear without any trace or reason a day before Alvaro reaches his mother's home? What happened to all those characters in the novel that met Biondetta at one point or another and could enlighten his mother, and the reader, about her status (this is true in particular about the couple at the wedding and the guide who escorted them home)? Their disap- pearance is almost as mysterious and suspicious as Biondetta's. Is it possible to suggest that the narrator (Alvaro) tries to cover up the killing of Biondetta by means of his unverifiable, because fantastic, story as Siebers argues in the In the Arts 339</page><page sequence="21">From Parody to Paradox case of La Vénus dille and Lokisl It lies in the nature of what Todorov calls a "true" fantastic story not to grant us a satisfactory and explicitly stated answer to these questions. Nevertheless, each story gives away certain clues which the anthropologically sensitized reader can build into an interpretation that cuts through the myth of the supernatural. Le Diable amoureux provides us with two such clues: one in the novel it- self, the other in the "Avis de l'Editeur" from the definitive 1772 edition. In this "Avis," Cazotte all but leads the reader to the core of the novel's problem: Brisons là, et qu'il nous soit permis seulement de dire un mot de l'ouvrage Le style en est rapide; point d'esprit à la mode, point de métaphysique, point de science, encore moins de jolies impiétés et de hardiesses philosophiques; seulement un petit assassinat pour ne pas heurter dé front le goût actuel, et voilà tout. Il semble que l'auteur ait senti qu'un homme qui à la tête tournée d'amour est déjà bien à plaindre; mais que, lorsqu'une jolie femme est amoureuse de lui, le caresse, l'obsède, le mène et veut à toute force s'en faire aimer, c'est le diable. Beaucoup de Français, qui ne s'en vantent pas, ont été dans des grottes faire des évocations, y ont trouvé de vilaines bêtes qui leur criaient che vuoiï Et qui, sur leur réponse, leur présentaient un petit animal de treize à quatorze ans. Il est joli, on l'emmène; les bains, les habits, les modes, les vernis, les maîtres de toute espèce, l'argent, les contrats, les maisons, tout est en l'air; l'animal devient maître, le maître devient animal! Eh! Mais pourquoi? C'est que les Français ne sont pas Espagnols; c'est que le diable est bien malin; c'est qu'il n'est pas toujours si laid qu'on le dit. ( Diable 312) [Let us stop here and may we have the permission to say one word about this work. ... Its style is fast, it contains neither fashion- able esprit nor metaphysics nor science. We do not find any pretty impiousness or philosophical boldness in it. What we do find is just a little murder in order not to offend today's taste and that is all. It seems that the author felt that a man who is stricken by love is al- ready to be pitied. But when a pretty woman is in love with him, ca- resses him, is obsessed with him, leads him by the nose and wants to be loved at all cost: that is what we call the Devil. A lot of Frenchmen who, by the way, do not brag about this went to some grottos to summon something and then found some nasty animals saying what do you want? Once their question is answered, they present these men with a little animal of thirteen or fourteen years. It is pretty and they take it home. And suddenly there are baths, clothes, fashion, make-up, dance lessons; every- thing is a mess. The animal becomes the master and the master the animal! Eh! But why? Because the French are not Spaniards and because the Devil is quite clever and he is not always as ugly as one thinks] 340 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="22">Markus Muller The editor's (Cazotte's) remarks indicate that Alvaro has an affair with a very young woman who, at one point, becomes so persistent and dominant that he must dispose of her. This hypothesis of Alvaro having an affair with a girl whose age and social status is compromising to him is supported in the novel itself by Olympia, Biondetta's rival for Alvaro's love. In a letter which she ad- dresses to the "Prétendu Biondetto," she writes, "Je ne sais qui vous êtes, Ma- dame, ni ce que vous pouvez faire chez Don Alvaro; mais vous [Biondetta] êtes trop jeune pour n'être pas excusable, et en de trop mauvaises mains pour ne pas exciter la compassion" [I do not know who you are, Madame, and I do not know what business you have at the home of Don Alvaro. But you are too young not to be excused and in too evil hands not to stir our compassion] (Di- able 339). Olympia, the only character in this novel who has reason to dislike Biondetta, is also the only one not to treat her as a supernatural, and therefore evil, being. On the contrary, she has pity for her being in the hands of a man without morals. If we reread the novel with this information in mind, the su- pernatural scheme set up by Alvaro loses its luster. Nevertheless, the novel it- self does not permit a definitive answer to the question whether Alvaro actually killed or disposed of Biondetta because she had attained some kind of dominance over him from which he could not liberate himself. The suspicion regarding the status of the narrator hiding behind his protagonist has been raised, however, and plays a much more important role in later fantastic narra- tives. Cazotte's comments in the "Avis" are a rare find as they give us a glimpse at the central problematic in the fantastic. Notwithstanding the novel's "success" as a fantastic story in avoiding any final conclusion regarding the matter of the Devil/Biondetta, it points to a wide array of problems that mirror the transition from the classical to the modern world. By means of the fantastic element, Cazotte has opened the door to a literary phenomenon whose revelatory power concerning the prob- lematic relationship between the aesthetic and the ethical will show its full po- tential in the nineteenth century, beginning with E.T.A. Hoffmann and reaching its peak in the fantastic novellas of Prosper Mérimée. Notes 1 In her essay "Fantastic Tales," Ora Avni underlines the fantastic' s new "attitude toward storytelling" and concludes that "[rjeading no longer con- sists in extracting the meaning that was hidden in the story by the writer for all time, but in being helplessly suspended between possible meanings, between equally plausible albeit mutually exclusive stories that double each without ever merging into one coherent narrative..." (677). Avni's argument essen- tially follows Todorov's definition of the fantastic. I argue, however, that it is precisely this impossibility to make sense of the mutually exclusive story In the Arts 341</page><page sequence="23">From Parody to Paradox lines that necessitates a closer look at the ethical consequences of the violent acts committed in almost all fantastic narratives. 2 Georges Décote also discusses these episodes at length while focusing, however, more on their aesthetic than ethical aspects. 3 There is an interesting and much discussed episode in Chrétien de Troyes's Le Chevalier au Lion ( Yvain ) related to this problem. While looking for adventures, the knight Calogrenant encounters a creature that to him seems non-human and consequently evil. While approaching and preparing himself for a possible fight, he has time to give a detailed description of this creature which features all the typical elements that one would use to describe the Devil: a dark skin color, a hideous face, an excessive size, hairy ears, a hump, savage fur clothes, etc. When Calogrenant comes close enough to talk to the creature, he asks whether it is a good or evil thing. The stunning answer of the other is simply that he is a man. The encounter ends peacefully and has no further consequences. The connection to Ollivier and Le Diable amoureux is clear: the protagonists in all three stories are about to engage in combat with a being whose supernatural or natural origin is unclear to them. Whereas this fact in itself does not pose too much of a problem, the question is rather whether this being is evil or benevolent. The crucial point is that killing a "man" rather than a supernatural phenomenon is ethically questionable and the protagonists in all three examples refrain from it. 4 The link between the ethical and aesthetical conflict is nicely developed in the case of Ollivier and especially Enguerrand. During the different adven- tures in foreign countries, both men are courted by women who are described as more beautiful than their lovers at home. The difference between the physi- cally less desirable but legitimate fiancée at home and the extremely beautiful but illegitimate second lover is more obvious in Enguerrand's case than in Ollivier's. 5 I am following Eric Gans's definition of morals and ethics in Originary Thinking. Elements of Generative Anthropology. "The underlying sense of the distinction between morality and ethics is that the moral imposes an abso- lute and universal obligation whereas the ethical involves the weighing of his- torically specific principles" (45). 6 To make a distinction between "passion" and "desire" is crucial to our interpretation of Alvaro's behavior. Passion here is an essentially unproblematic way of satisfying one's "appetite," and does not involve any mediation. Desire, on the other hand, is mediated and potentially violent as René Girard has shown so convincingly in Deceit, Desire, and the Novel and Violence and the Sacred. As an aspiring romantic, Alvaro chooses the "new" concept of desire over the traditional "passion." What he does not realize is the danger inherent in desire. 7 That Quebracuernos is a doctor from Salamanca is of importance since the city was considered a center of intellectual and spiritual life in Spain be- 342 Journal of the Fantastic</page><page sequence="24">Markus Muller cause of its famous university and cathedrals. The city was at the height of its fame during the Renaissance, the classic and baroque era. It is therefore sym- bolic of the Ancien Régime. 8 This particular situation exemplifies Girard's distinction between exter- nal and internal mediation. The external mediator, here the mother, is not physically present yet she "mediates" her son's relationship to Biondetta even though she does this in a "negative" way. Alvaro has no clearly defined "inter- nal" mediator, that is, another man who would be his rival for the love of Biondetta. This is different in the case of Biondetta who, at one point, is being attacked by another woman who considers her as a rival. The lack of internal mediators explains the low level of violence in this story. Again, this would change drastically in the nineteenth century where external mediation is grad- ually replaced by a potentially much more violent internal mediation. 9 Enguerrand's earlier quoted remark supports this argument as he recog- nizes, on the one hand, the "price" that he has to pay for the pleasurable wel- come at the fairy's castle but to which he contrasts, on the other, the moral "duty" that obliges him to leave in search for his friend Ollivier. 10 See Virginia M. Marino's study "The Devil's Disocurse: The Meeting of Allegory and The Fantastic." Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts 8.3 (1997). She argues convincingly against the claim that allegory cannot exist in fantastic stories. 11 For a detailed discussion of the Devil's multiple presentations in French literature, see Max Milner's two-volume study Le Diable dans la littérature française. Paris: Corti, 1960. Cazotte implicitly confirms René Girard's argument that mimesis is more than an aesthetic concept (representation) and also contains the poten- tially dangerous concept of imitation. Unaware of the fact that his desire to deal with the supernatural world is mediated by Soberano, Alvaro focuses more on the representational aspect of mimesis. After the initial fear is gone, the Devil is little more to him than a genie that can fulfill his wishes. Conse- quently he orders a meal, a comfortable decoration of the room and musical entertainment; everything should be like the outside world. Knowing of Alvaro's desire for aesthetic pleasure, the page Biondetta uses it as a means to please him. On the other hand, she is aware of the dangers involved in the con- cept of imitation if several desires converge towards a single desired object. Biondetta tells how the sylphs were fighting over the right to become the handsome Alvaro's servant. 13 The French word "commerce" incorporates the meanings of "business" and "social company" and thus underlines the contractual nature of the rela- tionship between the Devil and Alvaro which he never fully understands. 14 Fairy tales use the inverse direction of this metamorphosis. They want us to believe that a giant (i.e. an excessively large human being) can in fact turn into an animal, an impressive one first (such as a lion), but then into a In the Arts 343</page><page sequence="25">From Parody to Paradox noxious rodent whose killing by the cat, far from being morally unacceptable, is a positive action. 15 Alvaro's first order is a perfect demonstration of this attitude. He orders the dog to prepare an elaborate dinner with plenty of wine and music for his friends. On their way home from the ruins where the party has taken place, Soberano wonders about the price that Alvaro has to pay for the dinner. The latter's response, "Ami, . . ., je vous le donne pour ce qu'il me coûte." [Friend, . . ., I give it to you for what it costs me] ( Diable 324) indicates that Alvaro did not understand Soberano's concerns. Alvaro thinks about money and is right that it did not "cost" him anything. However, as the continuation of the novel will show, Biondetta expects more than a monetary payment from him. 16 The automatic nature of Alvaro's actions is revealed several times throughout the text but most explicitly after the night in which he supposedly slept with Biondetta. When he wakes up after a fourteen hour sleep, he is un- able to act rationally and in this scene it is he who actually resembles some kind of "monster": "Les yeux hébétés, la bouche béante, j'étais moins un homme qu'un automate" [The eyes numb with fatigue, the mouth wide open, I was more an automaton than a man] {Diable 372) 17 The pronoun "le" in this case seems to refer to the masculine gender of "l'être dangereux dont j'avais agréé les services" [The dangerous being whose services I have requested] rather than to the servant Biondetto. Never- theless, the ambiguity of the passage further contributes to the reader's confu- sion in regard to Alvaro's attitude towards Biondetto/Biondetta. 18 The name Olympia will return in a new version, Olimpia, as the me- chanical doll in Hoffmann's "The Sandman." Hoffmann, who had read Le Di- able amoureux, reverses the names but not the overall structure of mimetic desire. He maintains the principle according to which the protagonist's "real" object of desire must be the "fantastic" woman. More than Cazotte, Hoffmann stresses this difference between the bourgeois and uninteresting Clara, the "real" woman, and the fantastic doll Olimpia. 19 One might claim that Alvaro is actually not lying when he says that she is not a woman if we accept that he considers her as a supernatural being. However, if we assume that the supernatural argument is only a scheme, Alvaro's statement is nothing but a simple lie. It is interesting to note that Alvaro always uses the name Biondetto as a protection against accusations from third parties. What has started as a "real" confusion on Alvaro's part at the beginning of the novel is now used by him as an ethically questionable lin- guistic tool. 20 See for instance the articles by Laurence M.
