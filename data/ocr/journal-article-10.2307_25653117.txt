Rice Published online: 27 March 2009 ? Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009 Abstract Studies of the organization of Maya pottery production have been pursued via numerous methods but without theoretical models. I review available data on production of Late Classic southern lowland Maya polychrome pottery in light of my calendrically based may model of geopolitical organization. I conclude that: (1) production arrangements vary by "kind" of pottery; (2) "craft specialization" and "workshops" are inappropriate concepts; (3) study of polychrome production necessitates multiple approaches, including analysis of decorative content; (4) better "bridging arguments" and "middle-range theory" are needed; (5) figural poly chromes were "inalienable" wealth goods; and (6) they were painted in palaces of primary and secondary centers?may and k'atun seats in the model?in realm specific signature styles. Keywords Classic lowland Maya Pottery production Polychromes Political economy Pottery in Mesoamerica was made in a multitude of shapes and colors to meet a multitude of needs, both quotidian and ceremonial. The most abundant pottery consists of containers for the preparation, serving, and storage of solid and liquid foodstuffs and also might be used for gifts, display, funerary service, burning of resins, and ritual caches. Non-container fired clay goods such as figurines, whistles, rattles, drums, and the like are also common. Among the Classic Maya, the best known ceramics are multi-colored polychromes painted with human figures, glyphic texts, mythic and palace scenes, and myriad floral, faunal, and geometric motifs. P.

Unfortu nately, most of these studies have been carried out in a theoretical vacuum without anthropologically informed theories or models of political or domestic economies to guide data collection, hypothesis testing, or interpretation. Here, I review available data on Late Classic (A.D. 600-830) southern lowland Maya polychrome pottery to evaluate its "fit" in my recently proposed (Rice 2004, 2009a, b), calendrically based may model of geopolitical organization. In doing so, I explore two issues: (1) the circumstances under which this pottery was produced, and (2) the methodological and theoretical challenges attendant to investigating those circumstances. Background Existing interpretations of the organization of Late Classic Maya pottery production propose that this activity was decentralized, major political centers were primarily consumers rather than producers of pottery, and little evidence exists for elite control (Ball 1993; Foias 2002, 2004; Lucero 1992: 144, 145; Rice 1987a, b; West 2002). Unfortunately, these studies also seem to convey the idea that Maya pottery was either a monolithic, undifferentiated commodity or a gallimaufry of goods produced by unorganized, independent artisans isolated from market forces. As discussed below, the underlying reality is more complex: varied kinds of pottery were made by varied producers in varied settings and organizational modes, for varied consumers. Consequently, any assessment of the role of pottery production in a political or domestic economy requires systematic attention to these diverse categories of products, producers, contexts, and consumers. Long interested in the organization of lowland Maya pottery production and circulation, I finally realized that to investigate this topic I had to understand Maya political economy . . . and to comprehend political economy I first had to decode "the political." But until recently, no consensus existed about the nature of Maya political organization. Competing models debated degrees of centralization vs. decentralization, the latter often favoring a segmentary state model (Ball 1993; Reents-Budet 1994). Ultimately, the expanding corpus of decipherments of royal and political titles resulted in support for hierarchical, centralized political systems (e.g., Martin and Grube 2000). This emerging concord allowed me to elaborate a suggestion by the late ethnohistorian Munro S. Edmonson (1979) that Classic Maya political organization resembled that of the Late Postclassic and early Colonial periods in the northern lowlands. That organization was cosmo-geopolitical: a primary center hosted or "seated" the may ("cycle"), a calendrical cycle of ~256 Gregorian years, and secondary centers rotated in seating its 13 constituent k'atuns of just under 20 years (Rice 2004). Although many archeologists working with Postclassic material found this Central Place Theory-like model reasonable, those working primarily in Classic contexts are skeptical (Rice n.d.a). So I explored the Preclassic development of Maya calendars (Rice 2007) and the theoretical and cross-cultural relations between time/calendrics and political power (Rice 2008). Mythistorical and astro-calendrical knowledge?Anthony Giddens (1981) Springer</page><page sequence="3">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 119 authoritative resources; Pierre Bourdieu's (1977) symbolic capital (see also Munn 1992: 109)?and related ritual performances were directed toward "control" of time and privileged interactions among dynasts, the cosmos, and ancestors. This constituted the basis for Maya elite wealth, power, and dynastic legitimacy. I also investigated how a time-knowledge-based may model of geopolitical organization might have structured Classic lowland Maya political economies (Rice 2009a). Key institutions of production, consumption, and distribution in these decentralized cosmo-political economies included a ritual mode of production (Rappaport 1984), a palace economy, lavish elite feasting, and periodic markets, all within a spatio-temporal network of geopolitical capitals rotating through k'atun and may cycles. Economic affairs in the Late Classic period might have been handled in a manner similar to the Postclassic, when secular responsibilities such as tax and tribute collection were ceded by the sacred (sihyaj ka'an "heaven born") may centers to their satellite k'atun seats. In the end, all these exegeses established a framework within which I could pursue my goal of exploring the social, political, and economic circumstances of Late Classic Maya pottery production. Here I explore how the cosmo-geopolitico-economic may model might have operated with respect to pottery production. This model would hold that the highest quality elite polychromes were produced in the royal palaces of sacred may and k'atun seats; other kinds of less intricately finished pottery were produced at progressively greater social and spatial distances from divine centers. My review focuses on the Late Classic southern lowlands and its painted polychromes because more, and more different kinds of, data can be extracted from this category. The absence of direct evidence forces me to proceed indirectly and address general concepts of "where" it was made as a proxy for socioeconomic features of organization. Slipped monochromes and unslipped utility wares are given less attention and I attempt no systematic evaluation of special purpose or non-container pottery, such as incense burners (Rice 1999, 2009b), figurines (Halperin 2007; Bishop et al. 2000), instruments (Hammond 1972a, b), and the like. To anticipate, my conclusions are that (1) the arrangements of Late Classic southern lowland Maya pottery production and distribution varied according to the "kind" of pottery being made and its intended uses and users, and (2) extant data on polychrome production are interpretable within the may model. The first has been a general assumption for decades, but it has not been systematically explored and remains undertheorized; the second would be greatly strengthened by more rigorous methodological and middle-range theoretical approaches to questions of pottery provenience. Polychrome-Painted Pottery of the Late Classic Southern Lowland Maya: A Review Multi-hued painted pottery is a distinguishing characteristic of Classic southern lowland Maya material culture. Typical forms are cylindrical vases, footed plates, and bowls/dishes of varying sizes but simple contours, and less commonly jars and other forms. These polychromes are considered prestigious serving wares, mortuary furniture, and gifts for political allies. Springer</page><page sequence="4">120 Rice Production Technology Late Classic Maya pottery, like all pre-Columbian Maya ceramics, is classed as earthenware: a low-fired (below 900-950?C), unvitrified, and unglazed clay body. It was produced by hand-building (primarily coiling) without the use of a pivoted wheel (although possibly with an unpivoted support; Thompson 1958: 76-81) and, apparently, in the absence of widespread use of formal kilns (Becker 2003; cf. Lopez Varela et al. 2001; Urban et al. 1997). Polychromes of the Late Classic period are exceptionally elegant (Fig. 1) and production of the finest of these required considerable knowledge of physical chemistry (Rice 1985: 123-125). Vessel surfaces were typically given a light colored, calcareous coating, much as the pages of Maya bark-paper books (codices) were sized, to create a smooth, clean surface on which to paint. This cream/white underslip occasionally contains inclusions, suggesting that potters may have been concerned about "fit": different rates of thermal expansion or shrinkage of the sizing compared to the underlying clay body during firing (Shepard 1962; Brady et al 1998: 27, 28). The design space is usually bounded by one or more red or black (or both) bands encircling the rim and the base. The colors of the painted scenes include black/ brown, reds, pink, orange/yellow, cream to white, and occasionally gray, their myriad shades created by varying concentrations of pigment or layering. These and other techniques allowed painters to represent three-dimensionality, solve "the problem of foreshortening, show folds of heavy and lightweight attire and drapery, and portray the complex mechanism of the human frame in the beauty of its L M N O P Q R U V A B C D F G H I J K L Fig. 1 A polychrome cylindrical vase in the Ik' style, bearing a palace scene.

Two standing attendants smoking (tobacco?) flank the scene, one behind the k'uhul ajaw, the other behind the tribute bearers. On the left side of the scene another attendant holds a rolled-up palanquin or litter. The upper band of glyphs is the primary standard sequence, read from Glyph A through V. It reads: "7 Ajaw 13 Mol came into being/was blessed, its painting, his drinking vessel for tree-fresh cacao; lineage member, he goes to holy station One Ajaw, ?; Lord Completion Star [at Q], holy lord of the Ik' polity [Emblem Glyph at R], tree person, child of man, 3 ajaw, Holy lord of the Ik' polity" (Reents-Budet et al. 1994:175).

Springer</page><page sequence="5">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 121 movements and gestures" (Robicsek and Hales 1981: 5; also Taylor 1982: 108-110). Certain areas may be resist-painted: covered with wax or another substance that would disappear during firing, leaving the underslip exposed. After firing, the upper band may be covered with stucco and painted with distinctive Maya Blue pigment (Robicsek and Hales 1981: xix). Vessels were finished with a translucent, glossy slip, palest gold in color, made of exceptionally fine, colloidal particle size clay (&lt;0.001 mm diam.). To extract the colloidal fraction, potters would have had to do more than simply levigate clays or minerals in water to let coarse particles sink, which provided pigments for painting. Instead, they probably needed to add a deflocculating agent, such as ash or urine, to cause these finest particles to remain in suspension (Rice 1985: 124). The glossiness of this overslip might have resulted from naturally lustrous fine clay minerals (such as illite, although illite clays are rare in the limestone lowlands, most clays being montmorillonites). More likely, the gloss was created through the addition of plant extracts: infusions made by soaking the bark of certain tropical trees, especially the chucum tree (Pithecolobium albicans), found in lowland swamp forests (see also Thompson 1958: 99, 100). When mixed with plasters, these colloidal organic additives aided in reducing shrinkage, providing smoother, glossier, and harder surfaces, and improving bonding and ease of polishing (Littman 1960). Such extracts also might have been added to the calcareous underslip and paints. The final and most risky step of pottery production is firing: after major investments in time, labor, and materials in forming, drying, and decorating a batch of pottery, all could be lost in a firing accident. Three concerns must have been uppermost. One is that the firing time, temperature, and atmosphere (oxidizing) would have to be sufficient to burn off any organic additives in the gloss coating. Second, the firing of calcareous or calcite-tempered pottery is precarious because calcite dissociates chemically, with consequent physical expansion, at temperatures of 750?C or more (Rice 1987c: 103? 105). Vessels fired at higher temperatures exhibit surface pock-marking ("lime popping") and may eventually completely disintegrate. Third, the color and luster of paints and slips may be lost at high firing temperatures; thus, the pots might have been fired at temperatures not exceeding 700?C (R. Sonin, cited in Taylor 1982: 108nl). Many Late Classic polychromes were produced with pastes tempered not with calcite but with volcanic ash, which permits higher firing, but these too were fired at relatively low temperatures. This suggests that maintaining the glossy colors of painting and slips was the limiting factor for firing temperatures. Under these circumstances, it is likely that the most elaborately decorated of these polychromes were fired one or a few at a time in "saggar kilns": that is, a decorated vase was placed inside another larger pot (a saggar) with the fire built around its exterior (Rice 1985: 118; Becker 2003: 103). This mode of firing would have protected the delicate painting from direct contact with fuel and flames and explains the lack of fireclouding that would mar the scenes' perfection. Saggars might have been made of unslipped coarse wares, which, through repeated use, would have suffered sufficient heat stress that they broke and crumbled and so are not recovered archeologically. Alternatively, saggars could have been made of an especially refractive clay-temper recipe that could withstand multiple high firings, such as large Late and Terminal Classic ash-tempered basins with incurved, bolstered rims (e.g., Tinaja Red, Cameron Incised, Subin Red). I sometimes encounter sherds of these vessels that are decidedly high-fired ("clinky") Springer</page><page sequence="6">122 Rice and exhibit striking orange and fuschia-pink colors of over-firing alongside gray in cross-section (Rice 1987d: 59, 63, 67, 69). Polychrome Styles The painted decoration of Late Classic polychromes also entailed high levels of skill and knowledge, but this knowledge was historical and cultural rather than technological. Early studies of polychromes focused on individual vessels (Miller 1989) and systematic surveys leading to identification of regional styles or schools of Classic Maya painting and painters, similar to those of Greek Classical pottery painting, were slow to appear (Taylor 1982: 108). An early attempt to formulate such distinctions, based on an extremely limited sample, recognized three: Copan Motagua, Pusilha-Uaxactun, and Holmul-Yalloch (Vaillant 1932: 78-83). Later, after far more pottery was available, Michael Coe (1973) identified the "Codex style," in which numerous variants could be linked to sites or regions and perhaps to individual artists (Robicsek and Hales 1981). Most recently, Dorie Reents-Budet et al (1994) published a comprehensive overview of polychrome painting styles. Early efforts to identify styles prompted disagreement about the content of the imagery. The finest vessels are pictorial or figural, depicting humans, supernaturals, or impersonators, a veritable bestiary of animal characters, vegetation, architectural forms, and glyphic texts. Debates swirled about whether these scenes are historical, representing actual events, or mythological, especially as illustrations of the late highland K'iche' Maya Popol Vuh origin myth (Coe 1973; Coggins 1975: 500, 501; Chase 1985). Recent categorizations simply distinguish between cosmological/ funerary scenes and palace scenes (Reents-Budet 1994: 4). Statistical analysis of the layout and texts on polychrome vases reveals a hierarchy of standardized sizes and ratios of figures and glyphs?a decorative canon?observed by painters irrespective of where they painted (Loughmiller-Newman 2008; see also Greider 1964). Several Late Classic polychrome styles (Coe 1973; Reents-Budet 1994; MacLeod and Reents-Budet 1994; Robicsek and Hales 1981; Boot 2003) have been identified. They are distinguished by features of iconography, composition, and especially color palettes, and within-group chemical compositional variations lead to inferences of multiple production locales: Ik' style (with five substyles; see Fig. 1) Holmul style (two style groups; red-and-orange-on-cream painting) Turkey Vulture style (a funerary ware, depicting the mythological Muwan bird; primarily on plates in the northern lowlands) Chama style (a short-lived style in Alta Verapaz, characterized by narrow encircling bands of black-and-white chevrons bounding figural scenes) Tikal Dancer or Maize God Transformation Plate style (dancing Young Maize God transforming into ballplayer in interior base, walls with paneled decoration) Altun Ha style (frequently a black background; two compositional groups) Codex style (characterized by fine black-brown line work in multiple styles) Uaxactun style (not found at Tikal) Black-background vases Eastern Peten group (resembles the Codex style) Springer</page><page sequence="7">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 123 As seen in Table I, some styles have a broad regional distribution, particularly the Ik' and Holmul styles. Others have rather restricted spatial occurrence and are described as local. Although multi-colored painted pottery began to be created in the Maya lowlands during the Protoclassic or Terminal Preclassic period and continued through the Early Classic, it was not until the Late Classic that the distinctively elegant figural/ pictorial polychromes were painted. Reents-Budet (1998: 73, 74) links their production to the rise of interpolity competition, warfare, and shifting alliances in the Late Classic. Production of distinct styles was a "response to highly localized and situational phenomena" that "were not tied to pan-regional, unified, and creative strategies .... In fact, the sociopolitical function of the pictorial pottery demanded the opposite." According to this interpretation, pictorial polychromes, especially with their textual claims, were vehicles for asserting the elite identity of those who commissioned, owned, and used these vessels and bestowed them upon their elite allies on significant ceremonial occasions. They were instruments of status rivalry, the competition being played out through the decorative virtuosity displayed in the painted scene and the skill and knowledge of the painter. The Primary Standard Sequence The hieroglyphic texts appearing on Classic polychromes were long dismissed as simply decorative borders painted by illiterate artists who made "senseless mistakes" in dates and were "ignorant of hieroglyphic writing" (Thompson 1960: 27; see Table I Characteristics of Late Classic Lowland Maya Polychrome Style Groups Style Figural Dancer PSS Subgroups Status Funerary?

This view began to change with Coe's (1973) The Maya Scribe and His World, in which he suggested that the painting was done by the same literate scribes who wrote the codices. Through epigraphers' recent successes, these inscriptions can now be read (Stuart 1989) and are differentiated as primary and secondary texts (Coe and Kerr 1998: 60). Primary texts, which may be lengthy, typically appear in a band below the rim, although a subset of Codex-style vessels may consist entirely of glyphs documenting dynastic histories (Robicsek and Hales 1981: 97-104). Secondary texts are shorter, typically placed within the scenes and identify the individuals or objects depicted (e.g., tribute bundles) or the name of the painter of the vessel. Some texts are not readable, instead consisting of pseudoglyphs. Both primary and secondary texts may include important signs called Emblem Glyphs that carry toponymic and perhaps dynastic identifiers. The primary text on many of these vessels is called the primary standard sequence or PSS (Coe 1973: 13; Coe and Kerr 1998: 60, 61; Coe and Van Stone 2001; MacLeod and Reents-Budet 1994; Mora-Marin 2004) or standard dedicatory formula (SDF; Boot 2005). The PSS/SDF (see Fig. 1) is typically painted, but sometimes incised, in an encircling exterior band below the rim of vases and bowls, and on the (usually interior) walls of plates and dishes. As the name suggests, it is a relatively standardized and formulaic proclamation about the creation and ownership of the vessel (MacLeod and Reents-Budet 1994: 108, 109). The length and glyph choices vary, but a full text might be elided as: "it came into being, was presented/blessed, its writing/painting, his [drinking] vessel [for cacao]" followed by the name/title(s) of the owner/patron?who is often pictured in the scene?and the name of the artist. The text may also include terms for different vessel shapes, decorative surface treatment, and uses or contents (Table II). Two early examples of the PSS suggest that "the presentation of objects" was an important element of early dynastic affairs (Houston 2000: 145). Theoretical Concepts Questions abound as to how and where Classic Maya polychrome pottery was produced: in workshops or households, by full-time or part-time specialists, in political centers vs. rural areas, year-round or seasonally. Two key concepts in the "how and where" of production are specialization (specifically craft specialization) and workshops.

Gordon Childe's early twentieth century concepts relating to technological development?especially in metalworking?which he associated with an "urban revolution" and the civilizations of the Near East and the European Bronze Age. Childe articulated the dichotomies of full-time vs. part-time, dependent vs. independent, and household vs. village specialization as part of contrasting Neolithic self-sufficiency against the Marxist dialectical notion of elite domination of relations of production (Wailes 1996; Wright 1996; Schortman and Urban 2004: 186). The latter involved the alienation of goods from their artisan producers as elites appropriated and controlled surpluses, resources, and production and allocation of goods and concentrated them in the power relations of an urban-centered political economy. According to Bruce Trigger (1980: 75, 127), however, Childe did not really grasp the distinctions between full- and part-time specialization, nor the implications of the Maya civilization's metal-less technology. Studies of specialized pottery production, Maya and otherwise, began to gain ground in the 1970s (e.g., Adams 1970; Becker 1973). There followed more than 30 years of anthropological efforts to define, refine, measure, and categorize variants of fundamental notions of specialized production of pottery and other goods (Clark 1995; Clark and Parry 1990; Costin 1991, 2001; Peacock 1981; Rice 1981, 1982, 1987c: 183-191, 1991; van der Leeuw 1977), along with the problems of identifying such variants in the archeological record. Many investigations of specialization as an economic activity embedded it in evolutionary models addressing socioeconomic intensification and socio-political complexity. Elizabeth Brumfiel and Timothy Earle (1987), for example, identified three categories of models explicating these relationships: commercial (advantaged by increased economic interdependency and efficiency), adaptationist (community specialization in response to needs accompa nying population growth), and political (specialization as a mechanism of politico economic control; e.g., Reents-Budet's explanation of Late Classic polychromes, above). However, these models failed to address specific questions concerning whether specialization referred to the expert skills of the artisan, proportion of time/ livelihood devoted, volume of output, single-product focus, spatial area/density and organization, societal ubiquity, or some combination of the above (see Brumfiel and Earle 1987: 5; Costin 2001). Efforts to isolate such variability often complicated, rather than simplified, the issue of identifying specialization, at least among the Maya. What does "craft" mean? "Unpacked" into its basic, most general form, the word is a noun and a verb. As a noun it refers to an art, trade, or occupation requiring special skill?manual skills or dexterity, skilled artistry, proficiency?in doing or making something (www.dictionary.com). As a verb, craft refers to the making of objects with skill and careful attention to detail. Cathy Costin (1998: 4) defines craft as "to create with a specific form, objective, or goal . . . involving premeditative thought and deliberate, design-directed action." She takes the notion of crafting back to the making and using of tools as the defining characteristic of humans?although, of course, it is known that other primates (chimpanzees, orangutans) make tools. Mary Helms' (1993: 5) uses the term craft very broadly to include not only Springer</page><page sequence="10">126 Rice traditional production of material goods (pottery, textiles, metals, etc.) but also "other skilled abilities, including singing and instrumental musicianship, oratory and the activities of bards and poets, and dance, as well as hunting and navigation." I would put these latter in the category of performance?which, of course, can be broadly conceived to include performing any action, including production of material goods (Inomata 2007: 120, 121, 128, 129)?but my point is that such an expansive construal of crafting further opacifies the issue for archeologists. Ultimately, I dislike the term craft because its common usage denigrates the importance of this arena of production as akin to a hobby rather than a key contributor to the material wealth of pre-industrial societies: the word "invites caricature: . . . housewives . . . lovingly painting wooden geese, cows, or pigs in . . . milk paint colors," "arty, complacent, conservative, and safe" with "undertones of regressive ruralism" creating "the illusion of a simpler traditional life" (Shanks and McGuire 1996: 76). Basic definitions of "specialization" refer to a process of "making or becoming specialized"; specialized, in turn, is defined (rather circularly) as something developed, designed, adapted, or restricted to a special activity or function. Craft manufacturing differs from other kinds of production, such as agricultural, in that it refers to the skilled artisanry of making material goods. But there are other kinds of economic concentrations, such as in services, including leadership roles (see Hammond 1991: 261-265), and it is these more generalized occupational?rather than strictly craft goods?foci that should have greatest weight in evolutionary schemes. So many different concepts and processes are subsumed under the rubric of craft specialization (see Schortman and Urban 2004: Table 1) that, again, the term confuses rather than clarifies the situation, at least for the Late Classic lowland Maya (e.g., West 2002: 147). Helms makes the salient observation that craft production activities are "cosmological in orientation": crafting involves "specialized skills that generally serve non-utilitarian purposes, are imbued by definition with qualities of aesthetics, and are closely associated with political-ideological activities and symbolism" (1993: 6, emphasis in original). In this sense, crafting is specialized and the term craft specialization is rendered redundant. Craft specialization is not a mode of production; it is production, because crafters by definition possess special skills. Instead of craft specialists, we should refer to artisans or skilled producers. Workshops: An Inappropriate Productive Context Classic Maya pictorial polychromes are thought to have been produced in "a workshop which probably was spatially and socially attached to an elite residential environment or palace (here termed a 'palace workshop')" (Reents-Budet et al. 2000: 101). I am not confident that workshop is the proper term for the setting of this activity (see also Moholy-Nagy 1997: 294; Costin 1991: 8, 9). Dictionary definitions refer to a workshop as an area or room, group of rooms, or small buildings in which work, especially handcrafts, manual, or mechanical work, is carried out. Archeol ogists' models of production organization (Costin 1991, 2001; Peacock 1981; Rice 1987c: 184, 185) typically contrast workshops with household production, the former having a more formal structure involving multiple individuals and invest Springer</page><page sequence="11">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 127 merits in facilities, along with divisions of labor and spatially discrete activity areas. The general definition (an area where handcrafts are made) is not incorrect, but neither is it informative about the physical organizational contexts of production of Maya goods: a shady area under a tree where a woman sets up a backstop loom for a few hours can thereby be construed as a workshop. In the southern Maya lowlands, archeologists have identified some work areas: shell-working at Copan (Fash 1991: 159) and scribal work at Aguateca (Inomata 2001). These may be inferred post hoc to be workshops?that is, because shell-working debris was found there, they are areas of working shell?but are they for working shell: was this their intended or primary (specialized) function? To date, no physical facilities or workshops for making or painting Classic Maya pottery have been indisputably identified archeologically in the southern lowlands. Thus the term workshop should be avoided in discussions of Maya pottery production until one is actually identified and described archeologically. Polychrome Production Organization and Contexts It could be argued that my objections to terms like craft, specialization, and workshop are mere semantic quibbling. My counter-argument, however, is that this terminology is theoretically "loaded": it is encumbered by expectations of what we should find archeologically and clouds our interpretation of what we do find. The social, political, economic, and environmental circumstances of Classic Maya civilization differ considerably from those of the European Neolithic, the Near Eastern Bronze Age, and Childe's urban revolution. Figural polychromes clearly represent the output of extraordinarily skilled artists, but this does not necessitate the presence of either economic specialization or physical workshops among the Classic Maya. Methodological Approaches Where were Late Classic figural polychromes produced? Three methodological approaches have addressed this question: one identifies specific work loci; the other two suggest general geographic areas of production. 1. Physical materials approaches: study of direct evidence for production through primary-context identification of artifacts such as scraping and burnishing tools (Lopez Varela et al. 2002), molds, and the like; piles of resources (clay, temper, pigments); or remains associated with firing, such as burned areas, charcoal flecks, wasters, and, rarely, kilns (Urban et al. 1997. Reports on the putative multi-chambered pottery kilns at Late Classic K'axob [Lopez Varela et al. 2001: 184] do not indicate evidence of burning, smoke, ash, or wasters, casting doubt on their interpretation in pottery firing). I have elsewhere called this approach "micro-proveniencing" (Rice 1982: 219). 2. Distributional or geo-spatial approaches: application of concepts based on frequencies of occurrence of particular kinds of pottery, such as the age-area hypothesis, the criterion of abundance, and fall-off models combining frequencies and spatial distances. The "kinds of pottery" referenced here are ft Springer</page><page sequence="12">128 Rice primarily units of the type-variety classificatory system used by Mayanists? ceramic groups, types, and varieties (see Reents-Budet et al. 2000: 99; Ball 1994)?or form classes. Early efforts to study pottery production and its place in the lowland Maya economy often proceeded indirectly and interpretively backwards, relying on the areal disposition of various types or forms to infer distribution patterns, then inferring production areas from those distributional patterns, and sometimes using these inferences to interpret production control. This is a "macro-proveniencing" approach. 3. Physicochemical (mineral and chemical compositional) analyses: the rationale for chemical analysis is that potters' "recipes" for combinations of clay and non-plastics (and also for pigments) "are particular to individual workshops and potters, which can render their ceramic products chemically distinguishable from those of other pottery producers within the region and even among different potters in the same community_Pottery that shares a distinct paste-chemistry compositional profile should represent the output of a group of potters working closely together within one community and, possibly, even within one workshop" (Reents-Budet et al. 2000: 101; see also Arnold et al. 2000). Whereas in principle this also should be micro-proveniencing, in its theoretical basis (the provenience postulate; Bishop et al 1982: 301), it is macro-proveniencing: identifying general geographic and geological resource regions (i.e., paste compositional reference groups). It constitutes micro-proveniencing only if there are Emblem Glyphs on the pots, or if the pottery samples are recovered in association with the kinds of material data in (1) above, especially clays and tempers. Ideally, physicochemical analyses incorporate pottery samples from clearly defined contexts and locally available clays and other resources. In practice, many analyzed polychromes are from private collections and lack archeological contexts; clay samples may be unavailable; and the cultural practices of pottery making (e.g., addition of temper) may confound direct chemical-analytical relations between resources and final products. In such situations, compositional analyses yield groupings of the sampled vessels (and of resources, if included) derived from their elemental similarities, and these may or may not be statistically significant. Such groupings can indicate general regions of manufacture, depending on the sampling of clays or locally abundant pottery, but multiple producing units might use the same clay resources and single producing units might use multiple clays. Therefore, unless the samples are drawn from a single context archeologically identified with production, these geochemical groups are not necessarily equivalent, in and of themselves, to any socio-economic units such as workshops. Irrespective of these caveats, instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of Classic polychrome pottery, provenienced and non-, has revealed countless compositional groups, indicating multiple local and regional styles and centers of production in the lowlands. Reconstructing Production: Style and Content Categories "Style" is an ambiguous concept and is defined in different ways that may combine content (imagery) and execution (technique, skill). Art historian Reents-Budet Springer</page><page sequence="13">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 129 (1998: 73; Reents-Budet et al. 1994), for example, defined decorative style as "a constellation of specific technical, formal, iconographic, and epigraphic elements." Anthropological approaches to style, particularly with respect to pottery (reviewed in Rice 1987c: 244-272), tend to emphasize content: decorative styles are considered visual representations that transmit overt and covert meanings specific to, and structured by, particular times and places. Until recently, such studies tended to avoid technical issues of skill of execution. Defined as "a kind of knowledge," skill consists of "the ability to manipulate the vocabulary of techniques, designs, and customary resources" that leads to proficiency in executing some activity (Bleed 2008: 156; also Finlay and Bamforth 2008). Interpretation of Late Classic polychromes, particularly if the goal is to understand their production and use, requires a finer content-based categorization of their scenes and styles beyond simple dichotomization into palace and cosmological. Three things are important in the content classification in Table III. First, the distinctions among these categories are not always clear-cut and may overlap. For example, hunting and sacrifice themes may be deemed either realistic or mythological. Transformation scenes are particularly difficult, as the individuals may be actual lords or impersonators dancing, or they may be deity depictions. Images of monkeys may or may not be classed as mythological: the patrons of Maya arts are the monkey twins, Hun B'aatz' (One Monkey; howler monkey, Alouatta pigra) and Hun Chuwen (One Artisan; spider monkey, Ateles geojfroyi), the older half-brothers of the Hero Twins in the Popol Vuh (see Coe 1977). The distinction here is based on whether they appear in pictorial/narrative scenes. Second, vessels in all these content categories display variation in the painters' skill as assessed by composition (symmetry, balance, complexity), execution (quality Table III Content Categories of Late Classic Southern Lowland Maya Polychrome Pottery Decoration I. Pictorial/narrative scenes: one or more humans and/or supernaturals A. "Realistic" or historical scenes?human figures as focal actors in the built or natural environment 1.

Simple polychromes (colors typically restricted to red, black, and orange; found on rim or basal bands, but lacking decorative motifs) to Springer</page><page sequence="14">130 Rice of line, coloration, contouring), figural proportions, detailing, and so on (Reents Budet 1994: 2-35). The finest polychromes, especially in content categories I-IIA, are characterized by fine linework in the figures and glyphs; the best content category I vessels are also distinguished by a range of nuanced colors. Less skilled figural polychromes may be characterized by "simple pictorial compositions, less skilled representations of the human form, [and] greater use of geometric decorative motifs filling the pictorial space" (Reents-Budet 1994: 97). Polychromes in content categories IIB-V also exhibit a range of painting skill based on the above characteristics. The third point in this classification is that the PSS/SDF may appear in any of these categories, including content category V, an example being the simple Ik complex orange polychrome bowls with PSS found in some Tikal burials (Culbert 1993: Figs. 46c3, 49a2). On any polychromes, especially those less skillfully painted, the PSS may be incomplete rather than displaying the full sequence and lack the name of the painter and patron (Reents-Budet 1994: 97). Likewise, pseudoglyphs?a mock PSS glyph band?may appear on all categories of polychromes, including the finest ones. Pictorial polychromes bearing the full PSS/SDF provide unparalleled insights into the painters of these vessels and the circumstances of their creation. The colophon like PSS text identifies the painter via ts 'ib ', a verb meaning both "to paint" and "to write," that is, a scribe and probably also a codex painter (see Robicsek and Hales 1981: 237, 238). The lack of distinction between the two processes underscores the conceptual equivalence between the calligraphic painting of glyphic texts and the drawing/painting of humans, animals, and other scenes on pottery and other media (Reents-Budet 1994: 45). Another term for the vessel painter is its'aat "artist-sage" (ibid.: 1994: 49, 50). Painters and scribes are depicted on vessels with painting tools (brush, pen, stylus, bamboo quill or che 'eb *), often stuck in their hair, and inkpots (a longitudinally halved conch shell; Fig. 2). Fig. 2 Detail of a Zacatal Cream Polychrome Codex-style vase, showing a Maya scribe (ts 'ib'; its 'aat) painting a codex with his right hand and holding a shell paint pot in his left (redrawn by Don Rice from Reents-Budet 1994: Fig. 2.2.). Springer</page><page sequence="15">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 131 As indicated by the palace scenes, painters were intimately acquainted with the details of courtly life. Some artists identify themselves as royals by parentage statements: they may claim the noble title ajaw "lord" and be "sons of the nobility who seemingly were not in direct line for the throne" (Reents-Budet 1994: 55, 89, 132). One such lord is the master painter Aj Maxam of Naranjo, who signed himself its'aat, son of ruler K'ahk' Ukalaw Chan Chaak and Lady Shell Star (ibid:. 55; Martin and Grube 2000: 80, 81). The ts'ib' and its'aat were deeply educated in the esoteric knowledge largely restricted to the highest elites of Maya society, including literacy, calendrics, mythology, history, and cosmology (see Inomata 2007: 125, 127; Reents-Budet 1994: 5; Houston 2000: 148-150; Rice 2008). This knowledge is referenced in the concluding PSS phrase on one vase that refers to the owner/ patron's "inspiration for the scene" painted on it as u-na' u-ts 'ibal "his knowledge, his painting" (MacLeod and Reents-Budet 1994: 132, 133). Coe and Justin Kerr (1998): 62; Coe 1973: 22; cf. Houston et al. 1989) concluded that vessels with full PSS were "sacred objects," the PSS was a "hymn" intoned over the pot, and the person named was dedicating the vessel to the gods. If so, it is likely that few scribes had the knowledge and status to so sanctify a vessel. Some work areas may be referred to in PSS/SDF texts as u-yul u-kun "his work/ craft, his center/station/seat", followed by an Emblem-Glyph toponym or a personal name, perhaps identifying a "master artist" (MacLeod and Reents-Budet 1994: 133). Unfortunately, these texts do not indicate whether the pottery was produced and painted by males or females. Painters' titles are almost uniformly preceded by aj, the male agentive (and often honorific) prefix indicating "he who writes/paints," with one known exception (Coe and Kerr 1998: 89; Reents-Budet 1994: 45, 69n23, 1998: 73; also Foias 2004: 158, 159). In general, the primary productive activity of females was making textiles (Inomata 2007: 125; McAnany 2007). All this suggests that Table III?which could be read as a status ranking of polychromes by complexity of content and skill of painting?may yield clues to the production of these vessels. The painting of the most detailed scenes and texts was done by elite?even royal?artists in royal palaces. One such artisan at Copan was buried in a "massive" royal tomb in the floor of the Chorcha structure on the interior of Str. 10L-26. The grave goods accompanying this 35-40-year-old male included "small cylindrical paint pots, still conserving large quantities of red pigment in their interiors, and a Copador vessel with the image of a scribe" (Fash et al. 1992: 111). Investigators suggest he was the second son of ruler K'ahk' Uti' Witz' K'awiil ("Smoke Imix"). Painters who embellished the more simply decorated vessels may have lacked the familiarity with courtly life, mythic history, death symbolism, and literacy possessed by elite aj ts 'ib '/its 'aat. The lack of a named patron may indicate that these vessels were, like modern houses built "on spec," created for or acquired by anyone who could "afford" them. And, as discussed below, in some cases, the painting of scenes and texts was done by different hands. Case Studies: Geographical Locations of Polychrome Production As noted, I focus on questions of where this pottery was produced on a regional (Fig. 3), local, and structural scale. The PSS provides certain kinds of data, but other ft Springer</page><page sequence="16">132 Rice Fig. 3 Map of the southern Maya lowlands, showing sites mentioned in the text. Solid triangles: primary centers; open triangles: secondary centers. Inset: the Maya region of Mesoamerica, showing the area expanded in the larger map. archeological and compositional approaches to studying pottery production also yield useful information. Buenavista del Cayo, Western Belize Two types of pottery from Buenavista del Cayo and other sites in western Belize and eastern Peten were examined stylistically and compositionally (Reents-Budet et al. 2000). Chinos Black-on-cream, recovered at a variety of sites from primary through secondary centers and below, was made in at least two, and probably more, production areas. One was at Buenavista or nearby, its products characterized by a "simple iconographic program" and relatively small size (ibid.: 103). The second, likely around Naranjo and Xultun in eastern Peten, produced polychromes with complex pictorial scenes, hieroglyphic texts, full PSS, and varied forms (ibid.: 104). The second analyzed type was Cabrito Cream-polychrome (varieties Cabrito and Guajiro; also sometimes Zacatal Cream Polychrome: Cabrito variety), an example of the red-and-orange-on-cream Holmul style. Compositional data suggest multiple areas of manufacture, including Holmul, Naranjo, and Buenavista (Reents-Budet et al 2000: 107-116). The Buenavista examples are distinguished stylistically by seated or standing figures anomalously facing to the right and the absence of PSS texts. The meaning of this inversion of the normal order (in which central figures face left) is elusive, but it is tempting to suggest some relation to Joel Palka's (2002) observation that persons of subordinate status face right to gaze upon high-status individuals. Springer</page><page sequence="17">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 133 Two large deposits of this pottery are of interest. One, Palace Dump 1, comprising "literally dozens" of broken but reconstructible cream-polychrome vessels of varied forms, was an on-floor primary deposit in a courtyard adjacent to the Str. 31 platform of the Buenavista palace (Ball 1993: 250, 252). Joseph Ball (ibid.: 250), suggesting that this is "palace-sited" polychrome pottery production or painting, notes an intriguing "associated termination offering" of a limestone carving of the twin monkey-god patrons of the arts, as well as refuse from stone-tool making and bone carving activities. This deposit appears to signal termination (Stanton et al. 2008) of manufacture of this pottery, abandonment of the palace, or some other critical event. More of this pottery was recovered nearby, along with "fragments of ceramic levigation vats for a calcareous white slip, a variety of modeling, smoothing, scraping, and burnishing tools, and several small paint-pots holding traces of red, yellow, and Maya-blue pigments" (Reents-Budet et al. 2000: lllnl3). Clearly, pottery was given its white undercoating and painted red, orange, and blue somewhere in this palace. Compositional analyses of these polychromes, plus monochromes and bichromes from Buenavista and its environs, sorted them into seven groups dubbed "work shops," each of which included finely painted elite polychromes and more simply decorated and less well-made vessels (Reents-Budet et al. 2000: 111, 116). This suggests that each workshop "recognized and responded" to the needs of a socioeconomically wide range of consumers and was "specialized accordingly" (ibid.: 111). In actuality, the analysis recognized seven compositions or recipes of the ceramic bodies, not necessarily individual painting "workshops," each of which produced vessels with a sufficient variety of surface treatments (and, apparently, forms) that they cannot be considered "specialized" at all. These data also suggest that pots from varied production loci were brought to this palace for painting. Tikal, Central Peten, Guatemala Marshall Becker (1973, 2003) proposed that polychromes were manufactured in a distinctive class of residential architecture at Tikal known as the Plaza Plaza 2 (PP2). Nine of these PP2 groups were situated on a tongue of higher land extending into the Bajo Santa Fe on the eastern periphery of the city. In one, Group 4H-1, Structure 2 was built over a 1-m-deep pile of broken Late Classic Zacatal Cream Polychrome and Palmar Orange Polychrome types belonging to the Late Classic Ik and Imix complexes, about A.D. 550-750 (Becker 2003: 98; Coggins 1975: 429). Covering an area of approximately 75 m3, this deposit contained no polishing tools, pigments, or misfired wasters, but did incorporate a few molds and other unusual forms (Becker 2003: 98, 99). X-ray fluorescence analyses of 19 polychrome sherds from this deposit resulted in a tight cluster, suggesting a single paste (Culbert and Schwalbe 1987: 648-650). Other polychrome sherds recovered elsewhere in Tikal were also in this cluster, hinting that they were made in Group 4H-1, but the mechanism of distribution is unknown (Culbert 2003: 65). Becker (2003: 105) suggested that the PP2 group in 4H-1 represented members of a "single, extended, middle class kin unit" that formed a "craft guild" or barrio engaged in the production and "marketing" of polychrome pottery: "Residents within each of the nine groups may have focused on one aspect of production, such Springer</page><page sequence="18">134 Rice as clay gathering and potting, painting, or firing." However, it appears that residents of this group only painted the already-fired pottery (Coggins 1975: 429), a situation like that in the Buenavista palace. The deposit appears to represent some aspect of production, but lacks firing debris, and I see it as an example of a "special purpose dump" (Moholy-Nagy 1997: 302; see also Stanton et al. 2008) associated with termination. Clemency Coggins (1975: 513-548) described an unusual "set" of ten large figural polychrome cylinders recovered in Burial 116 in Tikal Temple I, believed to be the interment of Late Classic ruler Jasaw Chan K'awiil (formerly known as Ruler A or Ah Cacao). Nine are nearly identical: two panels, each with an enthroned lord and attendant, are separated by vertical panels; the two lords often appear to be of different status. A glyph band appears above these panels, below the rim; only one is a PSS. Typologically, the vessels are all either Zacatal Cream Polychrome or Palmar Orange Polychrome, depending on the background color. Coggins believes these vessels were made at or near Tikal, but painted by artists from different places: "these scenes were painted on prepared blanks at Tikal by emissaries from politically or dynastically related Maya Lords who are themselves depicted on the vessels as the donors" (Coggins 1975: 515). There are clear differences in the skills of the painters of the nominal texts in the figural panels vs. the encircling glyph bands. Coggins (ibid.: 539) suggests that "it was apparently necessary for the artists (who were probably the Lords depicted, on the vessels without emissaries) to add their own individualized, and local, rim inscription to the cylinder. Robert Fry (1969: 158, 1979: 495, 2003a, b: 146) interpreted an unusual pottery deposit in the wall-ditch earthworks complex north of Tikal as firing remains. This pottery, consisting of early Late Classic Saxche Polychrome fragments, occurred in three forms?barrel-shaped vases, flaring-side dishes, and drums?and 80-90% of it was of a distinctive local fine paste variant (Saxche paste). The sherds were in a "relatively homogeneous fine black earth layer" that "may represent the decomposed ash and carbonized material from the firing areas" (Fry 1969: 118, 159). There is no mention of actual ash or charcoal in the soil or wasters, or whether the sherds were conjoinable into pots, or, if so, how many. The deposit was recovered in an excavation unit west of a causeway crossing the four-meter-wide trench of the earthwork. These causeways were interpreted as "funnels for human traffic," controlling people and goods moving into and out of the greater Tikal area (Puleston and Callender 1967: 43). Thus, it is possible that this deposit represents a pot merchant's accident (see also Haviland 2003: 138): the hapless vendor, his carrying rack laden with valuable polychrome pottery, may have slipped and fallen on this narrow passage, or been turned away in some exchange with guards, losing all his merchandise as he was heading across Tikal's borders. It is difficult to guess whether this hypothetical vendor might have been moving into or out of Tikal. Fry's (1979: Figs. 3a, b, 4a, b; 2003a, b: Figs. 5.5 and 5.6) multi dimensional scaling of technological variables of vessels of Saxche paste suggests that they are found both north and south of the earthworks, but specific production loci have not been identified. The fine black soil might represent decomposed leaves, twine, and sticks comprising the merchant's backrack and packing of the delicate vessels. In the end, Fry's (2003b: 150) study of pottery from peripheral Tikal found "no direct evidence for specialized pottery production" (cf. Culbert 2003: 66) and he ft Springer</page><page sequence="19">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 135 concluded that "some workshops made almost the total range of slipped ceramics" rather than focusing on a single kind. Codex-Style Pottery, North-Central Peten, Guatemala "Codex-style" vessels (Coe 1973) display mythic and Underworld scenes and glyphic texts painted in black-brown paint over a cream background, hence their comparison to surviving codices. They occur primarily as vases and plates with red or black rim bands, but also myriad other forms in small quantities, and are classified as Zacatal Cream Polychrome in the type-variety system. Analysis by Barbara and Justin Kerr initially identified three painters, two named after the vases' provenience: the Princeton Painter, the Metropolitan Painter, and the Fantastic Painter (Miller 1989: 140). Later stylistic analyses suggested four possible "Codex Style Sites": the Calakmul region (red-rimmed; several styles and multiple painters), Naranjo, Xultun or Naj Tunich, and the "Ik' site," all of which had black rims (Robicsek and Hales 1981: 235, 236). Compositional analysis of a number of vessels and sherds, provenienced and unprovenienced, supports the stylistic interpretations and indicates multiple artists and loci of production (Hansen et al. 1991: 239, 241). Fragmentary Codex vessels are abundant at sites in the El Mirador Basin of extreme north-central Peten, and the Calakmul or Snake Emblem Glyph was noted on several unprovenienced vessels. Nakbe is an especially likely production site, particularly of vessels depicting scribes. Contexts of recovery of Codex-style vessels indicate they were available to a range of consumer statuses at various site sizes (ibid.). Copan, Northwestern Honduras Marilyn Beaudry's (1984; Bishop and Beaudry 1994) studies of Copador and other polychrome and fine-paste pottery in the southeastern lowlands employed INAA and identified several production recipes. Two main production centers for Copador existed in the Copan valley of Honduras, each using different resources: one produced for the Copan valley and the other made vessels for export to sites in western El Salvador. Pottery from a "secondary" production area was primarily exported to the Motagua valley, including Quirigua, in nearby Guatemala. Several possible household manufacturing areas also existed. Analyzed sherds included a few imported polychromes: three Codex style, "several" Holmul style, and miscellaneous figural and other polychromes from Peten and Belize (Bishop and Beaudry 1994: 427-434). Copan's economic orientation seemed to be to the south and east, despite its political focus (indicated by architecture and sculpture) toward the Guatemala-Belize region (ibid.: 426). "[N]o ceramic production locus has ever been excavated or identified" at the Copan center itself, despite years of intensive archeological investigations (Freter 1996: 927). Petexbatun, Southwestern Peten, Guatemala In the Petexbatun region, with its twin capitals of Dos Pilas and Aguateca, an INAA study of pottery production and distribution examined polychrome and monochrome Springer</page><page sequence="20">136 Rice wares. Interpretations were complicated by "weak" compositional patterning from site to site, apparently caused by the similarities of the carbonate-based clays and inclusions used in this area. The lack of ellipses (indicating 90% confidence intervals) around the dispersed and overlapping data point distributions raise questions about the interpretive utility of studies similar to these (L. Cecil, pers. comm., 7/20/08). This muddling might have been avoided if petrographic studies had been undertaken as the basis for the selection of samples for INAA. Alternatively, the high variability may signal genuinely widespread and individual ized pottery production. Analyses arranged the samples into 20 groups forming four major clusters, all with significant internal variability (Foias and Bishop 1997, 2007: 225-229). One cluster represents all sampled polychromes, including figural styles and vessels with PSS texts. The location of the resources and production for this cluster is believed to be near Dos Pilas, which suggested that "the most talented polychrome scribes were concentrated close to the capital" and perhaps were "attached to the royal court" (Foias and Bishop 2007: 227). A second cluster has three smaller groups that relate to production around Punta de Chimino, Dos Pilas, and Aguateca. A third included pottery from Tamarindito and Arroyo de Piedra, while a fourth had two subgroups, Aguateca and Tamarindito/Arroyo de Piedra. Each of these latter three groups and their subgroups included large proportions of monochromes as well as smaller proportions of polychromes. The most parsimonious explanation for these findings is intra-regional exchange of pottery, but other explanations cannot be excluded (ibid.: 230). Non-local vessels include volcanic ash-tempered figural polychromes with hieroglyphic texts produced in the Tikal-Uaxacrun and Ik' polity areas of central Peten, which were common only at Dos Pilas, and fine paste wares from the Usumacinta area, found at smaller sites (ibid.: 231, 232). At Aguateca, "all the excavated elite residences located outside of the royal palace contained remains of craft production," including scribal activity, shell working, and stone and wood carving (Inomata 2007: 121). In the House of the Scribe was a shell pigment holder with the word its 'aat carved on it. These mixed production remains underscore the important reality that "the Late Classic economic system did not support exclusively full-time elite single-medium craft specialization at each high status workshop" (Reents-Budet 1998: 84). However, per my earlier discussion, I do not believe these examples constitute either "craft specialization" or "workshops." Case Studies: Monochrome Serving Wares and "Utilitarian" Pottery If, as I propose, the vessels upon which polychrome decoration was painted were formed away from the palaces, then an important question is, Where? Were they made alongside vessels intended to have simple monochrome surface treatments and then delivered for painting as requested? Did the painter visit a potter to select a vessel? Were they made by special order, perhaps one at a time or in sets (e.g., Reents-Budet 1998: 81)? We may never know the answers to these questions, but it is worthwhile to review available data on non-polychrome pottery. Archeological investigations into virtually any Classic period context in the Maya lowlands recover vast quantities of fragments of red and black monochrome slipped Springer</page><page sequence="21">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 137 dishes and bowls, often with incised or impressed decoration, as well as unslipped utility wares, primarily jars. Despite their ubiquity, these kinds of pottery have not been as intensively analyzed with respect to production and distribution as have the elaborately painted polychromes, but they are essential for giving us an overall picture of the economic and functional roles of pottery produced and exchanged in the Classic Maya economy. Lubaantun, Southern Belize An early chemical provenience study investigated the pottery of Lubaantun, a small Emblem Glyph-bearing minor center in southern Belize (Hammond and Harbottle 1976; Hammond 1982: 226-228). Lubaantun has a short Late/Terminal Classic occupation history encompassing only 130 years or so and may have been settled by people from nearby Pusilha to the south. Most of the pottery?serving wares, including polychromes, as well as utilitarian cooking and storage vessels?was made "locally," using resources located up to 6 km from the center. One polychrome vase was compositionally identical to clay from the ridge upon which Lubaantun itself was situated. Norman Hammond (1982: 227) interprets this as "suggesting a workshop actually within the ceremonial precinct .... giving proof that talented artists had been working at even such small and provincial centers as Lubaantun," although he allows for the possibility of itinerant artists. Some data indicate the importation of decorated pottery from Pusilha, which had already ceased to erect stelae but "continued to support . . . high-quality ceramic artists for a century afterwards" (ibid.: 228). Lubaantun may have mass-manufactured mold-made figurines, particularly figurines of ballplayers, which were widely traded regionally; a concentration of figurines and molds was found in one of the site's central plazas (Hammond 1975: 373, 374). This might be said to represent production "specialization" in the senses of single-item focus and volume of output. Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico Robert Rands and Ronald Bishop (1980; Bishop 1994: 26-35) studied pottery production and distribution in the Palenque region through petrographic and chemical analyses. The analyzed pottery fell into four compositional groups that corresponded generally with the physiographic and geological zones surrounding the Palenque center: (1) The red-brown "macro-Palenque" paste group is associated with the center itself and was not traded out in any quantity. This paste was used for various basin-like bowls and plates, as well as special-use forms such as incense burner stands, figurines, and cache vessels. (2) The "Plains" paste group was made of clay from the coastal plain north of the site, characterized by abundant phytoliths; it was particularly associated with utilitarian vessels, including short-neck jars, found widely throughout the region. Paste groups (3) and (4), from the Sierras west of the center, were used primarily for serving wares; one was characterized by biotite mica. Exactly what the compositional data mean for administrative involvement in pottery production and distribution in the Palenque region is unclear. One interpretation is "community-level specialization" and a solar marketing system, Springer</page><page sequence="22">138 Rice perhaps involving periodic markets or itinerant traders (West 2002: 154-156). It is particularly interesting that both Hammond (1982: 226) and Bishop (1994: 32) noted the coincidence of the areal extent of Palenque's Emblem Glyph with the spatial occurrence of some of these classes of pottery. Polychromes are known but not abundant at Palenque. During the Otolum phase, A. D. 613-692, they were locally made, but during the following phase polychromes were imported, presumably from Peten (Rands 1973: 58). Their presence may be a consequence of an alliance forged between Palenque's ruler K'inich Janaab' Pakal I and his son, and Tikal's ruler Nuun Ujol Chaak, who was defeated by Calakmul in 657 and fled into exile. He appeared at Palenque in 659 (cf. Martin 2003: 28), the visit recorded in two inscriptions there during Pakal's reign. Imported polychromes appear in greater quantity in the Murcielagos phase, beginning in 692, immediately following Pakal's death when his son began rule. Copan, Northwestern Honduras Ann Corinne Freter examined pottery production in rural areas surrounding Copan using the "physical materials" approach. Environmental and ecological studies carried out by Proyecto Arqueologico Copan (PAC I and II) identified seven clay sources, some of which continued to have limited use in modern times for pottery and other goods. Late Classic pottery forms identified as utilitarian in the rural Copan area consisted of comales, calderas, incense burners, potstands, tecomates, bowls, jars, and plates. These were organized into ten type classes in four pastes, although most were classified as gray-white Zico paste (four types) and red Sepultura paste (four types; Freter 1996: Table 1). In each of these two pastes, one type had no slip or decoration, while the other three had red and/or orange interior and/or exterior slip/paint, with some incising. The two pastes had different but substantially overlapping distributions in the Copan region, judged by sherd frequencies: the red Sepultura wares were associated (probably in both production and distribution) with the main valley, close to the site of Copan, and areas to the east, whereas the gray-white Zico pastes were abundant and probably produced in rural areas in the Rio Sesesmil valley to the north (Freter 1996: Fig. 4). Seven rural pottery production loci were identified as part of the study, all located near known clay sources. Four were small multi-mound residential sites; three were "non-mound or single mound sites with no evidence of residential activities" located within 100 m of the other four (Freter 1996: 219). For example, sites 32D-3-1 (non mound) and 32D-3-2 (three mounds) are located in the upper Sesesmil valley. A single test pit at 32D-3-1 yielded a heavy ceramic concentration consisting almost entirely of Zico paste wares, approximately 5% of which were warped or misfired wasters; small deposits of unfired clay and abundant carbon flecks were noted, but no kiln or domestic artifacts (ibid.: 219, 220). Other proposed production sites reveal similar patterning. Freter (1996: 226, 227) concludes that utilitarian pottery production in the rural Copan area was carried out by commoner householders in relatively small courtyard groups near quality clay sources. Specific production loci lie on the edges of or behind these courtyards, identified archeologically by either actual work areas or middens and associated artifacts, including abundant pottery, deposits of pigment, ft Springer</page><page sequence="23">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 139 greenstone tools (serpentine celts) for burnishing, and 2-5% waster sherds. Firing areas 50-100 m away from the residences are characterized by burned and hardened soil, charcoal flecks, and wasters. Technologically, production has little investment in facilities (no kilns), is small in scale, and shows little central management, a reconstruction consistent with other utilitarian production systems in Copan (ibid: 228). Tikal, Central Peten, Guatemala T. Patrick Culbert (2003: 64, 65; Culbert and Schwalbe 1987) carried out X-ray fluorescence analyses of six elements in 362 pottery fragments from Tikal in the hope of determining compositional clusters that would reveal centers of production. However, their sample, representing Early through Terminal Classic polychromes (see above), monochromes, and unslipped jars, failed to cluster in this way. Instead, the researchers found the primary distinction was between two groups: calcite tempered wares characteristic of unslipped types and those tempered with other materials (volcanic ash). Among the latter, further statistical manipulation of the data revealed that a distinctive and widespread "pink" paste variant of Tinaja Red type formed a relatively discrete cluster suggestive of a single production center (Culbert 2003: 65, 66). The failure to achieve useful clustering in the original study may result from the high variability in sampled time periods and kinds of pottery, the reliance on only six elements, and the use of the suboptimal technique of XRF itself. Fry (1969, 1979, 1980, 2003a, b; Fry and Cox 1974) led efforts to identify pottery production and distribution loci in peripheral Tikal through patterns of spatial distributions in a cruciform survey transect extending out from the site center. Fall off curves in the occurrence of various categories of pottery, principally four forms of monochrome serving vessels and utilitarian jars, suggested the possibility of three to five production loci for each class of pottery, including central Tikal, north Tikal, and two satellite sites: Navajuelal to the south and Jimbal to the north. Synthesis: Late Classic Southern Lowland Maya Polychrome Pottery Production Pottery with expertly executed painted decoration?pictorial polychrome vases, plates, and other forms with liturgical texts?was, according to Reents-Budet et al. (1994: 219), "the work of specialized potters and/or apprentices to the master painter, both resident in the same workshop." Although these authors provide plausible rationales for this point, I am dubious, partly because of my concerns about defining what workshops actually are physically, but also because potting activities are dirty, dusty, and space-extensive (Rice 1987c). It is more likely that the clay vases and plates upon which content category I-IIA scenes and texts appeared were formed by potters elsewhere and, especially in the case of the most elaborate polychromes, brought individually or in small batches to the palace for painting. Moving unfired clay vessels any distance would have necessitated extreme care, high "green strength" of the clay body, or both, but if these vessels were indeed "sacred objects" for the highest of elites, such careful handling at all times would Springer</page><page sequence="24">140 Rice have been an obvious?and perhaps ritualized?part of production. Painting and firing, probably of one vessel at a time, as discussed above, was also likely a ritual performance. Evidence for in-palace painting is largely circumstantial and physical evidence is scanty, the most convincing data coming from Buenavista Palace Dump 1, which included polychrome fragments along with pottery-painting tools and pigments (Reents-Budet et al 2000: lllnl3). Content categories III, IV, and V, along with monochrome slipped wares, may or may not have been made in designated work areas, but their production differs substantially from figural polychromes in that there is no necessary reason to believe their creators were intimately associated with palaces of the highest elites. Instead, these wares appear to have been formed, fired, and painted in commoner (or perhaps "middle class") households in site peripheries, if the data from Copan and Tikal's Group 4H-1 can be generalized. They might have been brought to palaces to have PSS or other texts painted on them by knowledgeable scribes. The little available data about unslipped ware?primarily large, narrow-necked jars in central Peten?suggest a still different pattern of production and circulation based in commoner households in rural and/or peripheral areas. The Copan findings suggest that proximity to clay resources was an important siting criterion for utilitarian pottery production (Freter 1996). Any of these vessel classes might have been produced for own-use as well as for barter or exchange at local periodic markets or market fairs. Distribution of high-bulk, low-value goods such as large unlipped utilitarian jars, given the absence of beasts of burden and wheeled vehicles in the lowlands, was likely restricted spatially, which Thompson (1958: 115; also Fry 1969: 243) interprets as indicating a kind of "specialized" production. As discussed, I object to the term workshop in connection with lowland Maya pottery production, because to date one has not been found. The term might be replaced either by spatial referents to the area where the work is accomplished (a work area or production locus) or by a skill/style/knowledge-related concept (school, palace school; e.g., Ball 1993: 258). As proposed earlier, a ceramic school involves "several or many artists devoted to the production of whole or complete designs of perhaps some diversity but with a consistently discernable and recognizable stamp to them" (Gifford 1976: 15). I also believe the concepts of specialization and especially craft specialization, as currently construed, are inappropriate characterizations of Classic lowland Maya polychrome production. One salient point is that, if the painters themselves are members of the royal dynasty residing in the palace, they can hardly be called "attached specialists" unless they are fictive kin. More importantly, evidence from various Late Classic sites, particularly in the Petexbatun region (Inomata 2007), suggests that the residents of royal compounds engaged in "multi-crafting": they produced a variety of elite goods (carved stone, textiles, scribal work, worked bone, ceremonial attire) rather than a single category. Such multi-media production also characterizes seventeenth century Yucatan households: historian Diego Lopez de Cogolludo (1974: 15) observed: "What causes wonder is that there are many Indians who work at four or six trades where a Spaniard would have but one . . . ." That being the case, it is not surprising that a review of Colonial-period dictionaries to identify terms for Maya craft specialists concluded that "everyone was probably a specialist .... Every competent adult in Yucatec society could probably practice a ft Springer</page><page sequence="25">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 141 variety of crafts should he or she so choose, or circumstances dictate" (Clark and Houston 1998: 41). Although Colonial-period multi-crafting may reflect substantial social, economic, and demographic reorganization following the Spanish conquest, it might also reveal continuation of a fundamental lowland Maya strategy of productive diversification? and associated minimization of economic risk?as opposed to focused production at the household level, whether the household is commoner or royal. What is the reason for this pattern of economic diversification? Some combination of consumer demand (varying pottery replacement rates? were vessels viewed as "sets"?), potters' decisions (appeal to a broad range of consumer statuses?), marketing strategies (lack of formal market places that would encourage specialization?), and a multitude of other factors may have played a role, all of which demand further study. I would tentatively link the multi-product emphasis to (1) the Classic lowland Maya's broadly dispersed settlements throughout a natural environment that is relatively (e.g., as compared to the highlands) undifferentiated with regard to the spatial occurrence of highly desirable resources; and (2) the lack of intense "urbanization" and arrogation of control of production of the sort envisioned by Childe. This latter point forces rejection of two of the three models of economic specialization proposed by Brumfiel and Earle (1987), commercial and adaptationist, leaving the political model?politico-economic control?to explain any specializa tion that might have existed among the lowland Maya. But if there is little elite control of production?indeed, if Classic Maya political economies are knowledge based, decentralized, and cosmo-ritually chartered, as I have proposed (Rice 2009a)? then structural constructs such as craft specialization need to be rethought, if retained at all. For example, instead of being a socio-economic organizational characterization (mode of production), "specialization" among the Classic lowland Maya might be more narrowly reconceived as strictly product-based: skilled-labor- and knowledge intensive creation of elite wealth items, often from exotic raw materials, in a ritual mode of production within a ritual economy. This would exclude confounding (and largely unmeasurable) considerations such as proportion of time/livelihood devoted, volume and/or standardization of output, spatial area/density and organization, societal ubiquity, "attachment" to elites, and so on. Polychrome Production and the May Geopolitical Model How can the data reviewed above be incorporated into a better understanding of Late Classic lowland Maya polychrome pottery production? More specifically, can they be explained by the may-k'atun model of geopolitical organization? I think they can, and three polychrome decorative styles are particularly illustrative in this exercise: Ik', Codex, and Holmul. In particular, the association of Emblem Glyphs? geopolitical identifiers?with distinctive painting styles can be re-envisioned in terms of relations among primary centers/polity capitals and secondary centers or, in other words, may centers and k'atun seats. Both may display Emblems (Table IV). Ik'-style pottery, produced in several styles at multiple sites (as indicated by compositional studies), is distinguished by the presence of the Ik' Emblem Glyph. The Ik' site, unidentified but believed to lie on the northwestern shore of Lake Peten Springer</page><page sequence="26">142 Rice Table IV Political Centers and Styles of Polychrome Pottery Produced Emblem glyph Polychrome May Center K'atun Seat Style Distribution Ik' site Calakmul Naranjo Tikal (?) ?? Nakbe Holmul Uaxactun Ik' Codex Holmul Dancer Regional Regional? Regional Local Itza, was an important capital in the Terminal Classic period. Most known examples fall into my content category IA. At least two master painters worked in the Ik' style, one painting for the ruler known as the Fat Cacique and the other for Lord Completion Star (Reents-Budet et al. 1994: 173). At least one example of Codex-style pottery produced at Nakbe and elsewhere (indicated by compositional analyses) bears the Emblem Glyph of the kaan or snake polity centered at Calakmul, another major Late Classic political center whose Emblem appears on Copan Stela A and Seibal Stela 10. Codex-style pottery falls primarily in my content categories IB and IIA. The Holmul style apparently had multiple centers of production, one of which was Naranjo, as determined by the presence of that city's Emblem Glyph and the signature of the painter Ah Maxam. Pottery bearing the name of Naranjo rulers has been found at Buenavista, Tikal, Holmul, and Rio Azul (Houston et al. 1992: 506). Holmul-style vessels display a variety of content themes, primarily Categories I and III. These data lead me to the following propositions: That Classic Maya may seats created "signature" painting styles for their realms, analogous to the signature architectural complexes (e.g., twin-pyramid groups) and monument styles ("wedge-shaped" stelae; Giant Ajaw altars) that character ized particular realms and political affiliations (Rice 2004). That the primary center or may seat itself (Calakmul, Naranjo) and/or at least one identified secondary center (a k'atun seat: Nakbe, Holmul, respectively) in its realm were the locations of production of distinctive pictorial polychrome pottery styles. Production was limited to these centers because the knowledge of mythic history, courtly life, and literacy evidenced in the scenes and PSS/SDF texts was restricted to the highest of elites in primary and secondary centers (Rice 2008). For example, red-slipped black-on-cream polychromes of the Eastern Peten style (also western Belize) include figural and non-figural painted decoration. INAA indicates that this pottery was made at multiple locations. Stylistic analysis suggests that vessels with more complex decoration and the PSS were made at or near secondary (k'atun) centers such as Holmul and Xultun; vessels with simpler decoration were produced at or near smaller, tertiary sites (Reents-Budet et al. 2000). Some of this pottery displays an Emblem Glyph that resembles those of Xultun and Ucanal (MacLeod and Reents-Budet 1994: 156). Perhaps k'atun seats created their own substyles. ft Springer</page><page sequence="27">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 143 That in the Late Classic period, k'atun seats were vested with economic functions as they were in the Late Postclassic and postconquest periods in northern Yucatan. A Late Classic illustration comes from the mural in Room 1, Structure 1 at Bonampak, showing large tribute bundles of cacao beans; in the may model, the small site of Bonampak would have been a k 'atun seat. The mural text describes the accession of the Bonampak king "supervised by" (ukabjiiy) the ruler of Yaxchilan (a may seat), Itzamnaaj Bahlam IV (a.k.a. Shield Jaguar II); thus, this tribute of five pih kakaw (40,000 beans; Houston 2000: 173) was undoubtedly collected for presentation to the Yaxchilan ruler during his visit. Similarly, a cylindrical polychrome vase from the Pusilha area (K8089; Kerr, n.d.) shows a seated lord on a high throne accepting bundles of cloth tribute from four carriers; three courtiers seated below the lord seem to be examining the cloth. The text includes the Pusilha Emblem Glyph and the collocation pa itz "cloth tribute" (ibid.). Pusilha was likely a k'atun seat in Copan's may realm (Rice 2004: 181). Nothing in documentary sources indicates that pottery production was a function of Colonial-period k'atun seats, but I propose that polychrome production was during the Classic period. That changes in production may coincide with political changes interpretable in the may model. An example comes from Copan and Quirigua. Epigraphic data reveal that in 724 K'ak' Tiliw acceded to rulership at Quirigua, "supervised by" the Copan king. Quirigua then displayed its Emblem Glyph in 734, "defeated" Copan in 738, and began erecting monuments to celebrate 5-year k'atun subdivisions for a 64-year period. This sequence indicates that Quirigua replaced Copan as a regional seat of the may (Rice 2004: 179, 180). It is reflected in a new area of production of Tipon Orange-brown fine paste ware pottery: altered chemical composition of this pottery around A.D. 737 indicates that production expanded eastward to use clays from the newly elevated Quirigua region (Bishop and Beaudry 1994: 426). That polychrome styles were produced during specific intervals of a 256-year may cycle, probably the half may or 128 years when the seat was at its apogee. For example, the Turkey vulture style is estimated to have been painted between A.D. 593 and 731 (138 years), the Ik' style, 750-850 (100 years), and the Altun Ha style, 650-759 (109 years; Reents-Budet 1994). It is not unreasonable to suggest that these and perhaps other styles roughly correspond to this half-may interval. Mobility and Portability The most comprehensive studies of Classic Maya pictorial polychrome pottery production integrate observations on painting styles, imagery, and text with compositional data of the ceramic body, plus context of recovery. I have suggested that the clay vessels were formed as blanks by potters outside of the palaces where they were painted. In a theoretical ideal, in any given may realm a certain potter or potting unit consistently supplied pots, made with consistent paste recipes, in specific forms, for a certain painter of a specific style. But the factorial permutations of multiple clays, multiple forms, and multiple styles are endless, making the analytical reality difficult to comprehend. Springer</page><page sequence="28">144 Rice For example, single clay-temper paste recipes could be used for a variety of polychrome and monochrome forms, as shown by the vessels in the Buenavista palace, the deposit in the Tikal earthworks, and serving wares in the Tikal periphery. Moreover, stylistic studies indicate that individual artists painted a variety of vessel form-use classes in several styles, themes, and palettes. The most dramatic illustration of this is Naranjo master painter Aj Maxam, who painted vessels in at least three styles: black-background, red-and-orange-on-cream, and the eastern black-on-cream "codex-like" vessels (Reents-Budet 1994: 61-64). Some poly chrome styles defined by color palettes and iconography, such as the Ik' style, have multiple locations of production of the clay vessel as indicated by compositional studies. Such complicated situations can be expected wherever there are multiple suppliers of pots and multiple painters. Moreover, the artists of the pictorial scenes were not necessarily the scribes who painted the texts, and the pots and the painters/scribes might be from different places altogether. For example, the polychrome cylinders with rather simple palace scenes from Tikal royal Burial 116 may have been potted in or near Tikal but painted by visitors with varying skill levels from elsewhere (Coggins 1975: 515, 539). Different hands seem to have painted the secondary texts compared to the (largely pseudoglyph) encircling rim band. Similarly, a vase from Pusilha (K8089) has a beautifully painted palace scene with a distinctly greater-Peten stylistic flavor, but the non-PSS text of its rim band, with large, heavily outlined glyphs accentuated with bright colors, presents a jarring contrast. Multiple painters might explain the variations in choices of glyphs and phrases in the PSS that suggest the use of different dialects and possibly different languages, Ch'olan vs. Yukatekan (MacLeod and Reents-Budet 1994). Finally, not all vessels display Emblem Glyphs, pots are portable, and painters may be mobile. Skilled artists might have been sent from primary to secondary centers to paint particular commissions, in the same way that master stone carvers were sent from large centers to "provincial clients" (Martin and Grube 2000: 153; Houston 2000: 152, 154). Or, they might have been sent to instruct k'atun-SQdX painters in a particular style. Visitors could have brought their own pots with them or used locally supplied ones, as in Tikal Burial 116. Hammond suggested the possibility of itinerant artists at Lubaantun and Robicsek and Hales (1981: 250) seized this idea in their study of the Codex style: "We believe that some of the master painters . . . freely travelled to different centers to fulfill orders of patrons .... [the painter] chose his subjects accordingly and may have adopted aspects of the local artistic style, though still maintained his own individual artistic character to be recognizable.... [Alternatively] one may entertain the possibility that the artist did not change residence, but simply accepted orders and had his products, painted in the style desired, delivered to the different ruling houses that placed the 'order'." The "style desired," in the may model, would be the signature style of the may and k'atun seat (or the latter's substyle) that proclaims elite geopolitical affiliation. Circulation, Use, and Deposition How were these signature polychromes used? Emblem Glyphs and analyses of the composition of the clay body of vessels found in archeological contexts often reveal that they had traveled some distance from their presumed place of painting. Content ft Springer</page><page sequence="29">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 145 categories I and II polychromes are thought to have circulated within and between may realms primarily by sovereigns bestowing them as gifts emblemic of kingly alliances. Gift-giving is a form of reciprocity, particularly in societies with a cyclical worldview, where cycles of biological, societal, and cosmic regeneration are nourished by such gifts (Weiner 1980: 72, 73; Bloch and Parry 1982). This concept is reinforced with respect to these pictorial polychromes, which are imbued, not only by their esoteric imagery but also by the identity of the royal artisan, with mythistorical and cosmological significance. Their significance is further enhanced by the liturgical texts, which frequently display the Emblem Glyph of the producing site. These texts could be fully appreciated only by the literate elite, who could both produce and properly respond to them (see Houston 2000: 155). Elegant figural polychromes with PSS are not simply wealth or prestige goods, but represent quintessential "inalienable wealth": objects that cannot be "detached from their origins" (Weiner 1985: 210). Created on the basis of various kinds of restricted knowledge and within a ritual mode of production (Rice 2009a: 77), these vessels meet the key criteria of inalienability: "[OJnly certain people, because of the positions that they hold, have the knowledge or right to make them or own them," and they are not exchanged or circulated widely as commodities but rather are given as gifts (Mills 2004: 239, also 240: Table 1). The circulation of such objects in a range of social formations has been referred to as "keeping while giving" (I prefer "giving while keeping"), because "the giver's social and political identity remain embedded in the objects so that when given to others the objects create an emotional lien upon the receivers" (Weiner 1985: 212). Inalienable objects become fragmentary but concentrated personified or spiritual agents that reinforce and regenerate mythical origins, sacred ancestry, and hierarchy (Weiner 1985). As inalienable wealth, pictorial (and certain other classes of) polychromes are "singularities," one-of-a-kind objects that authenticate the identities of rulers in the may system. The painted scenes materialize social memories of the political events that created or commemorated the statuses of the recipients, events that often occurred at critical junctions of time?either human time as lived by the recipients (investiture; death) or cosmo-political time of the realm (calendrical units, especially k'atuns). These vessels lived their lives in the upper stratum of the Late Classic lowland Maya political economy?the palace economy and among the literati? where goods were mobilized not in response to market imperatives of supply and demand, but rather as highly visible mechanisms strategically deployed to sustain geopolitical power and identities, and reinforce divine status. The ceremonial bestowal of these vases and plates fed the cycles of social and political regeneration within the may system (see Weiner 1980: 72, 73). Because many vessels displayed death and Underworld symbolism, early debates concerned whether polychromes were produced primarily for royal funerary use (Coggins 1975: 499; Coe 1978: 11; Chase 1985: 201; Hansen et al 1991). Many beautiful polychromes have been found in interments, often displaying palace rather than mortuary scenes and, where dated, suggest actual historical events. The famous Ik' style "Altar Vase" depicting a ritual transformation dance was found with Burial 96, the interment of a young woman at Altar de Sacrificios; the vessel text bears a date of 9.16.3.0.0 (April 21, A.D. 754) and may identify three of the depicted personages as being from Yaxchilan and Tikal (Adams 1971: 68-75, 1977: 412). An Springer</page><page sequence="30">146 Rice Ik' style vase with a palace scene was found among the burial furniture of ruler Chanal Balam of Tamarindito, possibly a gift at his accession in 760; an Ik' plate was recovered in the tomb of Ruler 2 of Dos Pilas (Valdes 1997: 327-329). The Buenavista (or "Jauncy") vase was presumably created for a king of Naranjo but was recovered in the burial of a royal adolescent male at Buenavista (Taschek and Ball 1992) and a vase in the Altun Ha style was found in an elite burial at Copan (Reents Budet et al. 1994: 201). However, even if these vessels were painted only for use in burials, "they may have been painted long before the death of the individual whom they were to accompany, or they may have been painted for a specific ceremony which preceded the funeral by some length of time" (Chase 1985: 201). Thus, many polychromes deposited in burials may have been not only inalienable wealth objects but simultaneously heirlooms, with many of the same functions in collective memory: objectifications or mnemonics of histories, origin myths, and links to a "distant, ancestral past" (Lillios 1999: 252). Heirlooms authorize the ways in which the past is remembered and how identities are constructed. By defining "who one is in an historical sense" and "bringing past time into the present... the histories of ancestors, titles, or mythological events" become part of collective identity (Weiner 1985: 210). Their deposition in burials or caches represents a deliberate act of forgetting (Mills 2008) that occurs, like their gifting, on significant junctions in human and architectural lives, whether death/termination of a person or empowerment/ensouling of a building. Specific examples of termination can be seen in the Maize God Dancer/Transformation plates, which are often "killed" by holes drilled into their bases, eliminating their use as liquid containers. Maya lords visited other sites on the occasion of royal accessions, marriages, funerals, joint commemorations of calendrical cycle completion, anniversaries of courtly events, and so on (Schele and Mathews 1991), which created many opportunities for the presentation of polychromes. To judge from ethnohistorical accounts, such events were celebrated with lavish banquets and feasts. In colonial times, the feasts' hosts sent away their guests with gifts including a pottery vessel, "as beautiful as possible" (Landa in Tozzer 1941: 92). That Classic polychrome decoration commonly appears on cylindrical vases is likely a consequence of two factors. First, vases are vessels for drinking cacao, which is primarily an elite beverage; thus these vessels were undoubtedly conspicuously displayed in royal "diacritical" feasts (LeCount 2001; Callaghan 2008: 56, 57). Second, vases provide a larger, unbroken ("flat") surface upon which to create more conceptually and technically complex three-dimensional scenes and "wraparound" compositions (Reents-Budet 1994: 7). It is unclear what functional significance might be attached to the fact that Codex-style vessels are primarily bowls rather than vases (Robicsek and Hales 1981: 3). Full-text polychromes (content category IIA) raise some interesting questions. Eleven Codex-style vases are painted with texts that trace the dynastic history of Calakmul (Martin and Grube 2000: 102). The long text accompanying pictorial panels on the "'Vase' of 88 Glyphs" (K1440; actually a dish with outflaring sides) begins in mythological times, but appears to focus on the birth and accession of B'alam Te', who ruled Nim Li Punit, a k'atun seat in the Copan may realm (Rice 2004: 181). It seems logical that these vessels would have to have been given to or used by only individuals with similarly high levels of literacy to fully appreciate their significance and curate them. ft Springer</page><page sequence="31">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 147 It has generally been believed that there is a fairly direct relationship between the quality/complexity of polychrome decoration on pots and the socioeconomic contexts in which they are recovered. That is, the most complex and artistically best executed pictorial vases (in my content categories I?III, with full PSS texts) appear in the highest status contexts, including tombs, at primary centers, whereas pottery with less complex decoration and less esoteric content (less skillfully made vessels in content categories IV and V) appears in lower status contexts among the petty nobility and in peripheral regions. However, this presumed relationship is far more complex. Archeological contexts of recovery of these styles reveal that several were available to a relatively broad range of consumer statuses, not simply high elites. At Late Classic Tikal, pictorial polychromes did not seem to be so important, at least as royal mortuary furniture (Coggins 1975). Instead, many vessels in royal tombs were simple rounded bowls (content category V) painted only with the PSS, or tripod plates painted with encircling bands of the "dress-shirt" or turkey feather motif, which is so ubiquitous that it might be one of Tikal's may signatures (e.g., Burial 196; Culbert 1993: Figs. 64-67, 91-96). Method and Theory To obtain an accurate picture of Classic lowland Maya polychrome pottery production? particularly given the likelihood of multiple artisans and elite gifting?we need more than simply an analysis of artistic style and chemical composition. It is critical to integrate pottery data into anthropological, cultural, and behavioral theories, models, and concepts. Ideally, we should have all the following data for an individual pot: (1) full provenience information; (2) the painter's signature and a toponym (Emblem Glyph) or a ruler's name; (3) compositional data of the clay vessel; (4) compositional data on locally available clays and other resources; and (5) identified areas for potting, firing, and painting. Only where there is textual provenience data (2) can there be accuracy in distinguishing individual artistic styles comparable to that of distinguishing chemical compositions (3 and 4). It will also be important to obtain compositional data on pigments, and correlate these data with body composition, because first-order polychromes appear to have been potted and painted by different individuals or groups. Analyses of paints on Copan pottery (Goodall et al. 2008) and Postclassic Peten pottery (Cecil and Neff 2006) have revealed that different pigments can distinguish imports from local wares, and different motifs, layouts, and ethnopolitical groups, respectively. Equally important, Maya archeologists and ceramicists desperately need "bridging arguments," "middle range theory," and testable models to move successfully between archeological data and conclusions about production. Here, I have evaluated aspects of production and circulation of polychrome pottery in the Late Classic Maya lowlands in the context of one model of geopolitical organization?the may. Other models and concepts are needed, however. Ball (1993: 259), for example, suggested that "[c]eramics should be able to provide a portable object complement to Emblem glyph distributions." The categories of ceramic data that are most privileged with respect to inferring production are epigraphic (as in the PSS/SDF) and chemical-compositional (INAA), but for reasons of rarity and expense, these data are not always readily Springer</page><page sequence="32">148 Rice accessible. How, then, can other categories of pottery data be combined (with or without texts and INAA) into robust interpretations of economic contexts? Units of type-variety classification, a basic procedure for field-organizing variability in most lowland Maya archeological pottery collections, should be invested with greater agility for cultural interpretations. On-going debates about the utility of type-variety systematics in Maya pottery analyses have been futile and unproductive, because there is no agreement upon goals. Ball (1993: 245), noting that Fry's work at Tikal and Rands's work at Palenque suggest "multiform assemblages," proposes that these production units correspond closely to the ceramic group level of classification. I have argued for more than 30 years (Rice 1976, 1982, 2009b, n.d.b) that identification of "paste wares" should be a first step of field observation and pottery data organization if one of ceramicists' goals is to understand pottery economics. Paste wares can create: a "bridge" between primary data observations (classification) and final analyses; relate behavior (potters' choices in resources) to analytical data; facilitate sampling of collections for compositional analyses (see Cecil 2009); and structure other (decorative) interpretations (Rice 2009b). Changes in paste wares can also be related to political change, as in Copan's Tipon fine paste ware. Another classificatory unit with potential for studies of Maya pottery production is the "ceramic sphere." The present review and synthesis may be considered partly an evaluation of two earlier related observations that constitute testable hypotheses: the spatial limits of Late Classic polities and of ceramic spheres seem to coincide, and the distribution of Emblem Glyphs and regionally produced ceramics appear to coincide. Existing evidence for both is weak and equivocal, however. Concluding that spheres did not correspond to regional polities, Ball (1993: 256) noted that "in no known case has any individual Late Classic polity been shown to have extended beyond the limits of a single sphere." However, the distribution of Palenque's Emblem Glyph appears to coincide with the spatial distribution of some of the pottery produced in the region (Hammond 1982: 226; Bishop 1994: 32). A counter example is provided by Tikal and Calakmul, with Calakmul part of Tikal's Late Classic Tepeu 2 ceramic sphere and a broader "Peten-focused interaction sphere" (Braswell et al. 2004: 167, 168), despite the fact that epigraphy suggests that the two cities were bitter enemies. More work is needed. Ceramic spheres do appear to have some connection with social, economic, and/or political identities, as revealed by their shrinkage through the Late and Terminal Classic periods (Rice and Forsyth 2004). By many accounts, this interval of ca. 250 years (ca. 600-850) was a time of increasing socio-political tensions and warfare. The constriction of spheres might be testimony to a reduction in the areas of circulation of particular kinds of pottery . . . and perhaps a restriction in the areas covered by periodic marketing systems. On the other hand, the sphere shrinkage and warfare might relate to an intervening variable: inter-polity competition relating to may and/or k'atun seatings (k'atun also meaning war and warrior). Final Reflections I have argued elsewhere (Rice 2009a) that Classic Maya "cosmo-political" economies are relatively decentralized, with esoteric (especially astro-calendrical) ft Springer</page><page sequence="33">Late Classic Maya Pottery Production 149 knowledge and associated ritual, rather than material goods, constituting the ultimate basis of elite power and legitimation. They are characterized by a ritual mode of production, palace economy, elite feasting, and periodic markets embedded in a network of rotating geopolitical capitals based on k'atun (20-year) and may (256-year) cycling. In addition, they are difficult to analyze in strictly political and economic terms, and any control that rulers of may and k'atun seats exercised might have been more symbolic than direct (following Yoffee 1995: 296; Baines and Yoffee 1998: 232). I believe the preceding review has shown that critical components of the who, what, when, why, and where of Late Classic lowland Maya figural (and certain other categories of) polychrome pottery production and circulation can be explained by the may model. Within the model's framework, the organization of polychrome production and distribution appears to be variable and flexible, not so much among polities as among forms and decoration of pottery and its uses and users within polities. Thus, we should not speak of or search for a single?"the"?mode of production in the Maya lowlands. Rather, production arrangements vary depending on whether: the pottery is a polychrome and its "content category" and shape; it bears a text; and it is a monochrome or an unslipped utility vessel. Whatever the category, pottery manufacture, like that of other Late Classic lowland Maya goods, was small in scale and exhibits little evidence of vertical organization or investment in facilities. The production of figural polychrome pottery was only a tiny part of the Late Classic Maya political economy per se, and only a small part of pottery production in general. It is generally concluded that Late Classic southern lowland Maya elites did not control either production or distribution of most pottery. However, the preceding review suggests some refinements to this generalization, as well as some new perspectives on how archeological studies of Classic pottery production might be approached. During the Late Classic, when political power was vested in divine kings and their close kin, polychromes were painted by nobles at primary and secondary centers at the behest of the royal elites of the ruling centers. Figural pottery with the PSS/SDF was part of the high art (see Miller and Martin 2004) created for and consumed by Late Classic Maya dynasts and as such constitutes clear examples of the ritual mode of production in a palace economy. Thus, elites at major ceremonial centers technically were "producers" of pottery, but only of the polychrome painting on it, and they controlled its stylistic imprimatur. If considered in the context of a palace-household economy embedded in a cosmo-politico-ritual economy, it is clear that these vessels represented a category of inalienable wealth that constituted an important part of statecraft. Like stelae, they proclaimed the glories of the rulers and their courts (content category IA) and the mysteries of the cosmos and Maya mythistory (content category IB). Unlike stelae, they were small, portable, and could be handled, admired, used, and disposed of in varied contexts distant from their locales of painting, their distinctive scenes, palettes, and texts a constant assertion of geopolitical affiliation. Takeshi Inomata (2001) has shown that Maya elite engagement in production is not so much a strictly economic activity as it is a political and ideological one. Similarly, Helms (1993: 6) noted that "crafting" activities had a "cosmological orientation." This is literally true with respect to Late Classic southern lowland Maya Springer</page><page sequence="34">150 Rice polychrome pottery production and illustrates the concept of a knowledge-based cosmo-political ritual economy at the highest level. At least some flgural polychromes were produced by individuals related to divinity (i.e., family members of the divine king) versed in esoteric knowledge about history, mythology, and calendrics. The PSS/SDF on these vessels dedicates them to the gods. A major element of the overall prestige and inalienability of these polychromes is the "perceived like-in-kind relationship between artisans and the gods of Creation" (Reents-Budet 1998: 84).
