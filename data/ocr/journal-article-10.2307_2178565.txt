<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Idealistic Reaction Against Science. By PROFESSOR ALIOTTA. Translated by AGNES MCCASKELL. London, Macmillan &amp; Co. New York, The Macmillan Company, I9I4.-pp. xiii, 483. We are indebted to Miss Agnes McCaskill for this excellent trans- lation of a work by Professor Aliotta of the Royal University of Padua. The book falls naturally into two parts: the former consisting</page><page sequence="2">No. I.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 69 of a critical review of the opinions of others, and the latter giving, in highly condensed form, Professor Aliotta's own "outlines of a spiritual- istic conception of the world." In number of words the concluding argument is but a minor part of the work, though in interest most readers will find it the more important, and will welcome the promise that, if the fates are propitious, it will receive a separate and more extended treatment in a subsequent volume. This latter portion forms, as may be surmised, an area of convergence for lines of thought developed during, or employed in, the preceding pages of critical review. The writer, like most others, reveals his own thought as he reviews that of other thinkers, and his own statement of belief gathers up and completes the revelation previously given in more scattered form. The tendencies of modern thought are characterized, according to the writer, by a common reaction against intellectualism. This statement virtually opens the discussion, and we quickly perceive that this modern habit of refusing to assign an autonomous value to cognitive functions (this assignment being recognized by Aliotta as an adequate description of 'intellectualism') does not meet with approval. All sorts of arbitrary speculations, we are told, have entered through the door opened by anti-intellectualism; and prag- matism, with other characteristic lines of modern thought, is virtually classed with such eccentricities as theosophy, which are usually regarded as being outside the scope of profitable discussion. This and other comments prepare us to perceive that Aliotta has moved as violently towards intellectualism as modern thought has reacted from it. This imposes a limitation uopn his conceptions that finds expression in his gibe that modern logic has substituted sub specie generationis for sub specie ceternitatis. When he declares in his con- cluding argument that thought is the living model of all reality, he further betrays his blindness to the significance of the 'organism' and of the facts of 'generation', both to science and to the philosophy that can never be independent of biology or of the sciences with which it is connected through the latter. This intellectualistic position ignores the derivative and secondary nature of the dynamic function of cognition. There is much that happens without cognition or, for that matter, without any conscious- ness at all. Physical and chemical forces apparently owe no part of their activity to consciousness, though thought may direct them and thus become secondarily dynamic. Vital processes and generation in general, the growth of the embryo in the womb, the life-process of</page><page sequence="3">70 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXV. the plant, and, for the most part, of the animal, are dynamic without being conscious or cognitive. Mind, which is life attaining to con- scious function, is generated, as far as appearance goes, from uncon- scious impulse and activity; and its primary role, particularly in its cognitive efforts, is that of spectator, though it be an eager spectator that takes a hand in the game. Deprived of the assistance of the unconscious dynamism, cognition is powerless. We may decide consciously and cognitively to move our arms, but our consciousness is a controlling agent only, and the movements really result from the operation of unconscious dynamism. To make cognition or thought the living model of all reality is to ignore the universal dynamism from which consciousness arises, or in connection with which it has its source, to perceive and control it more or less completely. Throughout the volume, Professor Aliotta is very jealous for the absolute supremacy of consciousness. Darwinism is accused of em- phasizing the utilitarian value of psychic life and of reducing forms of thought to the likeness of biological types that are in continuous proc- ess of formation by adaptation. The Unconscious of Von Hartmann really involves a higher consciousness than our own. Criticism is dealt out to Paulsen for subordinating intelligence to will, and to Nietzsche for describing knowledge as a manifestation by will towards power. Pragmatism is smitten shrewdly. Kant is treated more leniently, for, though he reduces the true to the good after the manner of the pragmatist, he avoids the latter's blatant opportunism by finding a universal norm of objective value for judgment in the law of duty. Spencer receives the ample meed of criticism that many writers still consider it necessary to bestow upon him. Dr. Johnson held that the best proof that poverty is an evil is the number of attempts made to prove that it is not. The suspicion constantly arises that the best proof of the soundness of Spencer's thinking is the numerous attempts to prove it unsound. Aliotta seeks to overwhelm him by exhibiting the direful results to which his principles have led. Like Darwinism, they prepared the way for the reaction against Intellectualism by explaining conscious life as a biological adaptation. The meaning of the history of science thus lay in needs of life and action, and this biological consciousness, through Avenarius and Mach, finally descended into the abyss of pragmatism. To be the parent of pragmatism is for Aliotta the clearest proof of philosophical turpitude. Aliotta fails to recognize the full significance of his own criticism of mechanism, that evolution is qualitative transformation and the</page><page sequence="4">No. I.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 7I fruitful genesis of individual forms. Consciousness may originate as a response to practical needs without remaining, during its total evolution, immersed in them. The first function of cognition is to supply information of practical utility to the organism, information that will enable it to move towards and secure its food, to escape danger and to perform its general routine of conduct. Once the cognitive habit is established in reference to practical activity it can become the basis of that wider human thought in which knowledge becomes an end in itself instead of a mere means to action. The instinct of curios- ity might well develop as an assistance to conduct and then generate scientific and philosophical ardour. The animal investigates pri- marily to assure itself of safety, or to recognize a danger, or to discover a new source of satisfaction. In subsequent evolution the investiga- tion centers on the knowledge obtained and is less closely bound to adaptation to environment. "Intelligence, on the other hand, could not be an instrument of action . . . did its ideas and norms not correspond in some way to objective reality." In these words, Pro- fessor Aliotta himself indicates how thought has benefitted by its development out of a consciousness devoted to practical ends, though he denies such origination. By aiming at knowledge for practical purposes, consciousness prepared the way for a further endeavour after knowledge itself, in place of exclusive preoccupation with knowl- edge for the sake of action. Life is a stern taskmaster, and if action is to be successfully guided by cognition that cognition must be ade- quately conformed to reality. The philosopher who seeks to expand the possibilities of thought is the fortunate inheritor of a consciousness that has been trained in such fundamental processes as perception by the stern discipline of ages to conform its cognitive habit to the realities around it. Limitation of scope and insight existed and exist, no doubt; for nature in her disciplinary methods accepts adequacy and does not insist on perfection, but adequacy she does demand. It is much to the good that the earlier cognitive habits of conscious- ness had to be rigorously adequate to the demands of life upon the organism; and the thought that, to alter Aliotta's statement, is "a function derived from other psychic activities which are not thought" is all the stronger for this early discipline of its progenitors. There is another side to the picture no doubt. Cognitive methods that work well for the purposes of practical activity may be misleading when consciousness applies them on the more speculative or theoretical side. The system has yet to be discovered in which advantage has not to be purchased by the acceptance of-some degree of disadvantage.</page><page sequence="5">72 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXV. The history of human thought is scarcely favorable to the view that, even with man, a reason adequate to the full grasp of all reality sprang full-born into the world like Minerva from the head of Zeus. There is much that is sound in the critical attitude towards mechan- ism that pervades the book. The partial and abstract character of scientific schemes is justly insisted upon. The denial of a genetic relation between nature and consciousness which is used as a link in the final argument for the existence of an Absolute Consciousness seems, however, to involve fallacious reasoning. We travel in a circle, runs this argument, if we infer the generation of consciousness, which is cognitive activity, from nature as we conceive it, which is a product of this cognitive activity. There can be no such genetic relation because "'nature is already invested with the forms of thoughts" through the cognitive activity of the mind which is supposed to issue from it. Since Aliotta himself recognizes that it " is undoubtedly true that nature does not exist only in the act of thought, " he might reasonably be expected to distinguish between nature and our cogni- tive version of it. Consciousness could not arise from its own cogni- tive version of nature-this is all the argument amounts to. Its generation from nature apart from the latter's representation in a cognitive version remains a possibility. Otherwise we should deny that we were born of our mothers. Our knowledge of our parents is a cognitive version of them. But we issued from our mother's wombs, though this cognitive version did not, and could not, give us birth. A genetic relation between consciousness and nature affords a more satisfactory explanation of the fact that "even before consciousness existed the world was adapted to transcription into our mathe- matical formulas and mental schemes," than Aliotta's contention that consciousness appears fully equipped with a scheme of categories into which the universe miraculously fits. The later comer has the task of adapting. Whether the earlier forms of consciousness can be said to be equipped with categories, which are simply highly generalized and abstract concepts, is very doubtful. In any case, the success of consciousness in its cognitive version of nature is most simply explained as the fruit of the commerce between the two-a commerce initiated and facilitated by the original genetic relation between them. After excluding the generation of consciousness from nature, the further possibility of regarding them as the manifestations of one and the same substance, and the idealism that cuts the Gordian knot by embracing the "whole of reality in a single eternal act of thought</page><page sequence="6">No. I.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 73 which is ever being renewed in the dialectical rhythm of its life," there remains the relation between human consciousness and the becoming of things, in which the former appears as the end to which the latter moves, and thought "projects its forms into things because it finds the significance of the world in itself." The Absolute Con- sciousness is then inferred because "an end which is not thought of by some consciousness is an epistemological absurdity," and the mind of man is the final phase in the eternal design, and nature is the phase preceding it. A passing comment on this epistemological version of the teleological argument might suggest that we know too little to assert that the mind of man is the final phase even in this world, or that it may not have been succeeded by further phases in spheres as yet inaccessible to us. Idealism is too curtly disposed of by referring to the intimate and private character of different conscious- nesses that cannot penetrate one another directly. Idealism is not convicted of failure to explain "the simultaneous existence of various acts of thought" by comparing it to hysterical multiple personality. There are suggestions of polypsychism even in the normal mind. Multiple personality might be the pathological reflection in the individual human psyche of a normal polypsychism in the universal mind. In the same vein of easy assumption and dogmatism the human mind is established as the end to which the becoming of things moves-a process, it may be further remarked, that would seem to involve something very like a genetic relation. Something more rigorous in the way of proof that human consciousness is not only a mere result but the consequence of an intention is required to establish the existence of the Absolute Consciousness. The weak- ness of the argument does not end here. If plants can reply to stimuli and struggle to execute what would be called purposes in the case of conscious beings, then there may be aiming without conscious intention. If, as is quite possible, the study of animal instinct should force us to conceive the occurrence of unconsciously directed activity, Professor Aliotta's argument, tottering throughout, collapses like a house of cards. The concluding effort to refute the charge of anthropomorphism against the conception of an Absolute Consciousness deserves atten- tion, since there is much confusion on this point. Many writers argue, for example, that the postulation of a force at the back of things is as anthropomorphic as to postulate an intelligence or mind. Professor Aliotta confuses the issue in a similar way. 'Force' is, of course, a conception of the human mind, but this is not anthropomorphism. Theism is anthropomorphic because the idea of God conceives the</page><page sequence="7">74 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXV. final cause after the manner and fashion of a man. 'Force,' on the other hand, is a conception deliberately designed to exclude, as far as possible, all likeness to human activity. There is obviously a difference between conceiving atoms as actuated by love and hate and as moved by bare mechanical propulsion. Both are human concep- tions, but the first is anthropomorphic because the atoms are repre- sented as like men, while in the second they are conceived as remotely as possible from human nature. Professor Aliotta follows the usual line of argument with its customary ignoring of the difference between conceived in terms of human thought and conceived after the manner and fashion of a man. Abstractly considered, the anthropomorphism of any conception, as far as argument is concerned, is an irrelevance, since this term is merely descriptive and has no bearing on validity. The anthro- pomorphism of Theism, qua anthropomorphism, is no objection to it. But it becomes a very valid objection indeed when evolution is con- ceived epigenetically. Epigenesis and anthropomorphism are sharply opposed to one another when the origin of things is in question. The latter regards man as originating in something similar to himself, the former leads to the conception of a primary condition very different from the mind that finally eventuated. This contrast has been sys- tematically ignored throughout the particular "spiritualistic concep- tion ofthe world" outlined by Professor Aliotta. He discards his own epigenetic criticism of mechanism that evolution is qualitative transformation and fruitful genesis of individual forms, and by seeking in a prior consciousness the raison d' etre of human minds becomes blind to the direct teaching of experience that in the world of life the river flows higher than its source. Final reference may be made to some interesting items in Aliotta's thought. There is an echo of Nietzsche's description of accident as the clashing of creative impulses in the suggestion that inert matter may result from the accidental meeting of spontaneous centers. Philosophy sees in the world a complex of real centers of spontaneous activities which, limiting one another externally, appear to be mechanical, inert and rigid, but are really, in the depth of their being, free tendency towards the ends of mind, mobile and living. This doctrine, combined with the psychological principle that consciousness is connected with blockage or arrested tendency, could easily lead one to regard con- sciousness as a product of evolution instead of as its prius. In the chapter on "The Theory of Models," the characteristically English habit, exemplified in Faraday, Kelvin, Maxwell and Lodge, of forming concrete representations of phenomena, is contrasted with the reduction of theory to a pure system of concepts and mathematical relations</page><page sequence="8">No. I.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 75 practised by Rankine, Mach, Ostwald and Duhem. The nominalistic prejudice is traced in the ambiguous sense of 'representation' in such models. The 'model' is suited to Herz's notion that natural science has for its problem the adaptation of foresight to practice, but the concept alone furthers the real aim of science to grasp the universal and permanent. The image has the scientific office of symbolizing the concept and rendering it communicable. There -is imageless thought. Physics is warned that it is sterile without the idea of force, and, in another place, mechanical causality is said to give transmission but not the origin of action. In an interesting dis- cussion on motion, it is represented as a condition not less necessary to intelligibility than space or time, and chance is not responsible for the foundations of the temple of science being laid in mechanics. Motion is not reducible to pure quantitative relations. There is a wealth of knowledge and power of exposition in the book. It is a pity that Professor Aliotta has not imbibed more completely the epigenetic spirit instead of insisting on the evolution principle that consciousness can only arise from consciousness. There is a failure to recognize that consciousness is a growing point of the universe, an apex on a wide base of matter, dynamism and unconscious vitality. JOSHUA C. REYNOLDS.
