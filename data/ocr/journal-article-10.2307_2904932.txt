<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Reflections of Mr Palomar and Mr Cogito: Italo Calvino and Zbigniew Herbert Sharon Wood Poetry is the great enemy of chance. Italo Calvino A poet's sphere of activity is not the time in which he lives but reality, which is a much broader notion. Zbigniew Herbert The months before Calvino's death in 1985 were spent in putting together a series of talks which were to have been given as the Charles Eliot Norton lectures at Harvard University. Entitled "Lightness," "Quickness," "Exacti- tude," 'Visibility" and "Multiplicity," they set out to identify those attributes of literature and of language which Calvino sees to be of value "for the next millennium." I would like to take his essay on "exactitude" as a starting point to look at Calvino's consistent interrogation of the troubled relation- ship between language and the world, between words and things, an inter- rogation which is the existential project of Palomar. Calvino's text, which appeared in 1983, stages literature as an epistemo- logical exercise, as an account of the collision between the cognitive ego and the object of its contemplation in a restless and uncertain world; it exam- ines the fragile and porous line between self and other, internal and exter- nal, observer and observed, writing and the written. Calvino's work has often been considered as the search for order in chaos, for pattern in diversity, for the structures of literature and literary language in the man- ner of much contemporary literary theory. The ironic melancholy of Pal- omar lies in its re-enactment of mental processes which seek order in the world and which are simultaneously sceptical as to the ultimate value of MLN 109 (1994): 128-141 ? 1994 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">MLN 129 their own perception and cognition. The dual process by which Palomar looks at the world and the world looks at Palomar reflects the uncertainty not whether reality exists but whether the cultural tools of philosophy, anthropology and science are adequate for apprehending it at all. The doubtful success of the cogito, of the ability of the mind to seize and compre- hend the world, is paralleled by an attempt to come to a different form of knowledge, that which is given by the senses, particularly the sense of sight. It is the collision and occasional collusion between these two theories of knowledge, the scepticism of Mr Palomar that either method will lead to ultimate truth, that provides the tension and inner dialectic of this work. The two theories of knowledge that constitute the poles of Palomar's expe- rience parallel almost exactly the division between British empiricism, the sensory school of philosophy, and the Continental rationalist and idealist schools. Calvino traces in our "frenzied and congested world" (Palomar, p. 4) a loss of meaning, a loss of precision evidenced by the flattening out of language through the media, advertising and so on, which leads to a weak- ening of the tie between word and thing, a loss of the sense of urgency of the word, the intimacy between signifier and signified. He writes that A pestilence has struck the human race in its most distinctive faculty-that is, the use of words. It is a plague afflicting language, revealing itself as a loss of cognition and immediacy, an automatism that tends to level out all expression into the most generic, anonymous and abstract formulas, to dilute new meanings, to blunt the edge of expressiveness, extinguishing the spark that shoots out from the collision of words and new circumstances ( . .) Maybe this lack of substance is not to be found in images or in language alone, but in the world itself. This plague strikes also at the lives of people and the history of nations. It makes all histories formless, random, confused, with neither beginning nor end. My discomfort arises from the loss of form that I notice in life, which I try to oppose with the only weapon I can think of-literature. (Six Memos, p. 57) Calvino hypothesises no linguistic Eden with perfect convergence of word and thing. But in historicising the loss of exactitude he specifies the urgen- cy of precision, the risk of political and historical deformation run by a language and literature which fails to take up the challenge of describing as accurately as possible the world in which we live. At this point I would like to bring in the work of the Polish poet Zbigniew Herbert to underline the conviction that exactitude and precision are essential for reasons not of simple verisimilitude but of survival. Herbert's poem, "Mr Cogito on the Need for Precision," makes an identical plea for exactitude and from a different political experience draws out the consequences of its failure: Mr Cogito is alarmed by a problem in the domain of applied mathematics</page><page sequence="3">130 SHARON WOOD the difficulties we encounter with operations of simple arithmetic children are lucky they add apple to apple subtract grain from grain the sum is correct the kindergarten of the world pulsates with a safe warmth particles of matter have been measured heavenly bodies weighed and only in human affairs inexcusable carelessness reigns supreme the lack of precise information over the immensity of history wheels a spectre the spectre of indefiniteness how many Greeks were killed at Troy -we don't know and also the number of victims of terror of the white the red the brown we don't know truly we don't know Mr Cogito rejects the sensible explanation that this was long ago the wind has thoroughly mixed the ashes the blood flowed to the sea sensible explanations intensify the alarm of Mr Cogito because even what is happening under our eyes evades numbers loses the human dimension somewhere there must be an error a fatal defect in our tools or a sin of memory The name of Zbigniew Herbert's persona clearly recalls the Cartesian cogito, the one incontrovertible truth in a world where all is to be doubted, the</page><page sequence="4">MLN 131 single statement which cannot be refuted. Mr Cogito is concerned not simply with philosophical or epistemological abstractions but with their realisation in the real world, in "the domain of applied mathematics"; his call is for a precise response to precise human circumstances, as the only way to combat the distortions of totalitarian power. Herbert is concerned primarily with the political dimension; behind Troy lie the spectres of Auschwitz, Dachau and Siberia. He goes on: how difficult it is to establish the names of all those who perished in the struggle with inhuman power accidental observers give doubtful figures accompanied by the shameful word 'about' and yet in these matters accuracy is essential we must not be wrong even by a single one we are despite everything the guardians of our brothers ignorance about those who have disappeared undermines the reality of the world it thrusts into the hell of appearances the devilish net of dialectics proclaiming there is no difference between the substance and the spectre ........ The Polish poet speaks of the gap between exactitude and the approximate nature of human affairs in terms of loss and death. Precision becomes for Herbert a defence against an exploitable carelessness, an unacceptable margin of error. Exactitude is the only defence against the tangled mess of human affairs, the corruption of power, and the only redemption for suffer- ing. It is the difference between the "substance" and the "spectre" that exercises the nervous, rather anxious individual who goes by the name of Mr Palomar, cousin to Mr Cogito in his urgent desire to see and speak the world with maximum clarity. The existential imperative has precise aesthet- ic and ethical implications for both writers. Calvino's search for clarity swings between the two poles of the signifier and the signified, between language as bestowing abstract order on the world, and the world itself in its diverse multiplicity of detail, in what Calvino calls "the tension between geometric rationality and the entanglements of human lives" (Six Memos, p. 71): My search for exactitude was branching out in two directions-on this one side, the reduction of secondary events to abstract patterns . . . and on the other, the</page><page sequence="5">132 SHARON WOOD effort made by words to present the tangible aspect of things as precisely as possible. (.. .) My writing has always found itself facing two divergent paths that correspond to two different types of knowledge. One path goes into the mental space of bodiless rationality, where one may trace lines that converge, projections, abstract forms, vectors of force. The other path goes through a space crammed with objects and attempts to create a verbal equivalent of that space by filling the page with words, involving a most careful, painstaking effort to adapt what is written to what is not written, to the sum of what is sayable and not sayable. (Six Memos, p. 74) In "Mr Cogito and the Imagination" Zbigniew Herbert follows the second path suggested by Calvino, that of concrete objectivity. He pleads for lan- guage and literature almost literally to call a spade a spade, not in any abject or degraded realism but in order to keep literature firmly grounded in real human experience and thereby witness to the world: Mr Cogito never trusted tricks of the imagination the piano at the top of the Alps played false concerts for him he didn't appreciate labyrinths the Sphinx filled him with loathing he lived in a house with no basement without mirrors or dialectics jungles of tangled images were not his home he would rarely soar on the wings of a metaphor and then he fell like Icarus into the embrace of the Great Mother he adored tautologies explanations idem per idem that a bird is a bird a knife is a knife death remains death he loved the flat horizon a straight line the gravity of the earth In his call for a more concrete poetry Herbert rejects a central thrust of Western literature from Rimbaud to Poe to Borges, obliquely referred to in the poem just quoted: games of the imagination, the labyrinths of the inventive mind have no place in a literature still haunted by the concentra- tion camps. Herbert refuses the endless circularity and play of language, the deferral of meaning beloved of comfortable Western writers and critics who feel able to bracket off the world and let loose language to chase its</page><page sequence="6">MLN 133 own tail for ever. The apparent clarity of the tautology is a fragile bridge of language across an uncertain and shifting world. For Descartes tautology, along with the clarity of innate ideas and certain principles of mathematics, constituted those truths which could not be doubted, which were beyond scepticism. But tautology in Herbert's poetry becomes almost a statement of political dissidence. He can no longer say with Wittgenstein and the logical positivists that the two poles of tautology and contradiction are not factual but only logical truths which cannot be taken to signify reality: in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus Wittgenstein writes that "Tautology and con- tradiction are not pictures of reality. They present no possible state of affairs ... In the tautology the conditions of agreement with the world- the presenting relations-cancel one another, so that it stands on no pre- senting relation to reality." For Herbert, living in postwar communist Po- land, the tautology is in a sense the closest he can get to reality, the only thing that can be rescued from a shipwrecked language which has lost sight of reality. Language and literature become for Herbert not means of self- gratification but cognitive tools with an ethical and moral purpose in a world where simple and basic truths need to be repeated over and over again. The poem just quoted from continues: he used the imagination for entirely different purposes he wanted to make it an instrument of compassion Mr Cogito's imagination has the motion of a pendulum it crosses with precision from suffering to suffering there is no place in it for the artificial fires of poetry he would like to remain faithful to uncertain clarity. The tension between order and disorder contained in the final paradox "uncertain clarity" is crucial both to Herbert and to Calvino. The target of literature swings back and forth between the universe and the void. In this modern world which bases even its science on uncertainty and disorder, knowledge is based no longer on the certainties of Newtonian physics but on the theorisation of randomness, the shattering of everyday logic. While Mr Palomar finds himself bemused and puzzled, a rather odd and quirky character whose search for knowledge is regarded as a rather peculiar luxury by the pragmatists who surround him, Mr Cogito underlines the pain and suffering of humanity in a world of lies and evasions. While Cal- vino's Palomar, for all its sensuality and attention to the surface of things,</page><page sequence="7">134 SHARON WOOD remains largely a study of the intellect, Herbert turns poetry away from a self-obsessed circularity and restores it to the outside world. Before I go on with the discussion of the similarities and differences between Mr Palomar and Mr Cogito, it is worth saying something about the similarities and differences of their authors and the circumstances of their creation. I have not been able to discover references by one writer to the other, but Herbert did visit Italy a number of times in the 1960s and early 1970s, writing essays on Siena or the Duomo of Orvieto in the collection The Barbarian in the Garden. The short chapters about Mr Palomar, some of them almost prose poems in themselves, were published separately in news- papers before being collected into a single volume. Palomar was published in a single volume in 1983; Rapporto dalla cittc assediata, Herbert's Reportfrom a Besieged City in which a great number of the Mr Cogito poems appear, was translated into Italian in the same year. Herbert, often considered a "classicist" by critics, finds himself stretched taut between a "Western" cultural heritage (he graduated in philosophy, and the classics provide the initial starting point for a number of his poems) and the "Eastern" experience of communism and Stalinist repression. What I would like to emphasise, without diminishing the significant particularity of Herbert's experience as a dissident inhabitant of Poland, reduced to menial tasks such as dishwashing in order to survive, is the common intel- lectual heritage of the two writers, a common scepticism, a shared distrust of the formulations of the mind, which undoubtedly has as many implica- tions for future Europe as for the past. The scepticism of Calvino and Herbert leads both writers to a more intense examination of the surface of things. For Herbert, to invest mean- ing in objects is to counteract the intellectual perversion of Marxist dialec- tics, and in a poem entitled "Footstool" he addresses the stool thus: -Do you know my darling they were charlatans who said: the hand lies the eye lies when it touches shapes that are empty- they were bad people envious of things they wanted to trap the world with the bait of denial how to express to you my gratitude wonder you come always to the call of the eye with great immobility explaining by dumb-signs to a sorry intellect: we are genuine- at last the fidelity of things opens our eyes. ("Stool") Calvino's Mr Palomar similarly believes knowledge to begin not with the inner mind but with the external surface of things, and it is in this sense that both the Polish and the Italian writer have been compared to the French writer Francis Ponge, whom Calvino incidentally considered one of the most important writers of our times, a new Lucretius. The primacy of</page><page sequence="8">MLN 135 the surface of things, the notion that reality is inaccessible and unknowable, underpins all of Modernism: "It is only after you have come to know the surface of things," (Palomar) concludes, "that you venture to seek what is underneath. But the surface is inexhaustible." (Palomar, p. 51). Herbert doubts whether the surface can ever be penetrated at all, as he relates in a short prose poem called "The Wooden Die": A wooden die can be described only from without. We are therefore condemned to eternal ignorance of its essence. Even if it is quickly cut in two, immediately its inside becomes a wall and there occurs the lightning-swift transformation of a mystery into a skin. For this reason it is impossible to lay foundations for the psychology of a stone ball, of an iron bar, of a wooden cube. If "the theme of disinheritance, bereavement, expatriation, banishment from a symbolic Arcadia or Paradise Lost is the central theme of Herbert's work," as one critic has stated, his trust in tangible concretes is the reverse side of his distrust in ideology. The rupture between intellect and experi- ence, the crisis of epistemology, is one which is also central to this last work of Calvino. The names of the two personae, Mr Cogito and Mr Palomar cannot really be said to be a persona for the author. They are less a mask than a method, a mode of cognition in an uncertain world. Few assump- tions about the war and civilisation survived the war unscathed. What is important for Herbert, under the pressure of hard and conflicting realities, was the desire to look closely and intently at the world, at ordinary objects and feelings, stripped of any bias. Calvino lived under no such repressive regime. While his use of fantasy in early works such as "The Cloven Vis- count" or "The Non-Existent Knight" led to conflict with a realistically- minded Italian Communist Party over the relationship between art and politics, he lived the relatively easy life of a Western intellectual, where the ludic and the intellectual can afford to overlap. What I would argue here is that in Calvino's work there is a significant shift, a sea-change, away from "bodiless rationality" to a phenomenological position which takes Mr Pal- omar closer to Mr Cogito. Calvino's Mr Palomar who has, he tells us, spent his whole life in the pursuit of theory, an intellectual order by which we may understand the world, convinced that knowledge is a matter of the mind and not of the body, now tends towards an opposing theory of knowledge which is inductive rather than deductive. After a series of intellectual misadventures not worth recalling, Mr Palomar has decided that his chief activity will be looking at things from the outside. A bit near- sighted, absent-minded, introverted, he does not seem to belong temperamentally to that human type called an observer. And yet is has always happened that certain things-a stone wall, a seashell, a leaf, a teapot-present themselves to him as if asking him for minute and prolonged attention: he starts observing them almost unawares and his gaze begins to run over all the details, and is then unable to detach itself. Mr Palomar has decided that from now on he will redouble his attention: first, by not allowing these summons to escape him as they arrive from</page><page sequence="9">136 SHARON WOOD things; second, to attribute to the observer's operation the importance it deserves. (Palomar p. 101) If the name of Mr Cogito suggests a methodological approach, a definible philosophical position, then the name of Mr Palomar likewise suggests the route the intellectual project of Calvino's character will take. His rule that he will "stick to what he sees," that the precise object of his perception will be his own equivalent of the Cogito, is simultaneously underlined and un- dermined in his very name. If Palomar is the name of a telescope, of a means of observing the universe, its constituent parts of "palo" meaning stick or pole and "mar," obviously the sea, suggest the ironic and almost Don Quixotic nature of the enterprise. The rigidity and fixity of interpreta- tion and patterned order is instantly threatened with dispersal and frag- mentation, with the fluidity of water. While Calvino gives a highly ordered, structured account on the final pages of how his own book is structured, the process of reading constantly slips away from any straitjacket, just as nature slips away from Palomar's attempts to grasp and to name it. In the first story Palomar attempts to look at a wave-not the sea or waves in general but one specific wave. The search for the singular here emphasises the minimalist project of Mr Palomar which is to establish a direct relationship with one fragment of the universe, and to use this as a starting point for a new theory of knowledge. But the attempt to define a model, to abstract a pattern from the conflicting clash of currents and motions, leads threateningly to a rever- sal of the pragmatic and consensual order of space and time by which we live: Concentrating the attention on just one aspect makes it leap into the foreground and occupy the square, just as, with certain drawings, you have only to close your eyes and when you open them the perspective has changed. Now in the overlap- ping of crests moving in various directions the general pattern seems broken down into sections that rise and vanish. In addition, the reflux of every wave also has a power of its own that hinders the oncoming waves. And if you concentrate your attention on these backward thrusts it seems that the true movement is the one that begins from the shore and goes out to sea. Is this perhaps the real result that Mr Palomar is about to achieve? To make the waves run in the opposite direction, to overturn time, to perceive the true sub- stance of the world beyond sensory and mental habits? (Palomar, p. 6) Such a reversal would be the ultimate game, a rearrangement of reality to engage idle fantasy; though tempted, Palomar refuses to pursue the ludic implications of such an idea, although earlier characters of Calvino might have been more prepared to play the game. Examining his weed-ridden lawn, Mr Palomar wonders if what he sees is "lawn" or a collection of discrete elements, one blade of grass next to another next to another. The inherent instability of a wave, the impossibility of determining edges and boundaries through time, the chaotic proliferation of a patch of grass, the movement within an apparently single-minded flock of birds in perfect</page><page sequence="10">MLN 137 synchrony of elements which appear to be going in the opposite direction; each linguistic term which attempts to capture a piece of reality is subject to disintegration from within. Language as the most complex system by which we choose to come to terms with the world is, like the world itself, shifting and unstable, always unable to compete in exhaustive complexity with what Calvino calls the "natural languages" of the world, the endless morphology of objects. Waiting in line in a Parisian shop selling specialitis froumageres, Palomar contemplates the linguistic, cultural and anthropological connota- tions of different forms of cheese: There is a hint of complicity hovering in the air: the refinement of the taste buds, and especially of the olfactory organs, has its moments of weakness, of loss of class, when the cheeses on their platters seem to proffer themselves as if on the divans of a brothel. A perverse grin flickers in the satisfaction of debasing the object of one's own gluttony with lowering nicknames: crottin, boule de moine, bouton de culotte. This is not the kind of acquaintance that Mr Palomar is most inclined to pursue: he would be content to establish the simplicity of a direct physical relationship between man and cheese. But as in place of the cheeses he sees names of cheeses, concepts of cheeses, meanings of cheeses, contexts of cheeses, psychologies of cheeses, when he does not so much know as sense that behind each of these cheeses there is all that, then his relationship becomes very complicated (Palomar, p. 65) Calvino and Palomar accept the anthropomorphic nature of the imagina- tion, the inevitability of imbuing the world with human emotion and expec- tation such that the planet Mars can best be described as a planet which is "perplexed," which succeeds in communicating only a small part of what it has to say "as in a stammered, coughing speech" (Palomar, p. 35). Indeed Calvino's extraordinary feat of imagination in the earlier novel Cosmicomics invents variants of the universe which although absolutely uninhabitable for any known life forms, are described for us by the character Qwfwq who indulges in speculations and activities familiar to all of us. While Calvino describes the world as we describe ourselves, pointing out as all writers of fantasy point out that our imagination is necessarily co-terminous with our own physical experience of the world, Zbigniew Herbert is inversely per- plexed by the impossibility of describing ourselves other than in terms of the world around us. The failure of language, the impossibility of describ- ing the internal other than in terms of the external, the dispersal of human emotion along the dry ribs of metaphor means for Herbert a loss of some- thing which is specifically human, and which lies beyond the forms of language: I would like to describe joy or sadness but not as others do reaching for shafts of rain or sun</page><page sequence="11">138 SHARON WOOD I would like to describe a light which is being born in me but I know it does not resemble any star for it is not so bright not so pure and is uncertain I would like to describe courage without dragging behind me a dusty lion and also anxiety without shaking a glass full of water to put it another way I would give all metaphors in return for one word drawn out of my breast like a rib for one word contained within the boundaries of my skin but apparently this is not possible and just to say-I love I run around like mad picking up handfuls of birds and my tenderness which after all is not made of water asks the water for a face and anger different from fire borrows from it a loquacious tongue so is blurred so is blurred in me what white-haired gentlemen separated once and for all and said this is the subject and this the object ... ("I would like to describe") The position of the observer necessarily effects some change in the object of observation. Mr Palomar searches for a relationship with the world which is not based on his own ego: for even his contemplation of the stars is rooted in his sense of self, his own small sense of the world. Mr Palomar attempts to look at things not then from the inside but from the outside: Now it is not he who is looking; it is the world of outside that is looking outside. Having established this, he casts his gaze around, expecting a general transfigura- tion. No such thing. The usual everyday grayness surrounds him. Everything has to be thought through from the beginning...</page><page sequence="12">MLN 139 From the mute distance of things a sign must come, a summons, a wink: one thing detaches itself from the other things with the intention of signifying some- thing. .. What? Itself, a thing is happy to be looked at by other things only when it is convinced that it signifies itself and nothing else, amid things that signify themselves and nothing else. Opportunities of this kind are not frequent, to be sure; but sooner or later they will have to arise: it is enough to wait for one of those lucky coincidences to occur when the world wants to look and be looked at in the same instant and Mr Palomar happens to be going by. (Palomar, p. 102) Both writers toy with and then finally reject a solution which would abolish the mess and confusion of the ego from our relations with the world. Herbert's poem "Pebble" describes similarly the failure of the attempt to locate the meaning of an object within the object itself and not within our vision of it, while finally acknowledging the cold inhumanity and unde- sirability of the perfect non-human: The pebble is a perfect creature equal to itself mindful of its limits filled exactly with a pebbly meaning with a scent that does not remind one of anything does not frighten anything away does not arouse desire ...... -Pebbles cannot be tamed to the end they will look at us with a calm and very clear eye (from "Pebble") Palomar reaches a similar conclusion that knowledge of the world can only begin with knowledge of the self, that compassion is the only response to a world which is neither equal to itself nor mindful of its own limits. Knowl- edge does not bring about a revolution in the object of knowledge: the world continues to be a place of anxiety and suffering: "We can know nothing about what is outside us, if we overlook ourselves.... The universe is the mirror in which we can contemplate only what we have learned to know in ourselves." ( . .) He opens his eyes. What appears to his gaze is something he seems to have seen already, every day: streets full of people, hurrying, elbowing their way ahead, without looking one another in the face, among high walls, sharp and peeling. In the background, the starry sky scatters intermittent flashes like a stalled mechanism, which jerks and creaks in all its uncoiled joints, outposts of an endangered universe, twisted, restless as he is. (Palomar, p. 107) Calvino's Palomar took critics by surprise. The philosophical shift in a writer habitually regarded as one of the great intellectual game-players of contem- porary Western literature along with others such as Borges, the move out</page><page sequence="13">140 SHARON WOOD from the mind to the world, required a reading in reverse of his other works; if waves can go backwards then so can literature. Calvino, par excel- lence the writer of words, here aspires to be simultaneously the writer of things; the move from rationalism to a more complex phenomenology leaves him, and Palomar, caught between two theories of knowledge, a dialectic tension which is the best that the muddled human condition can hope for. Palomar visits a Zen garden in Japan: What does he see? He sees the human race in the era of great numbers, which extends in a crowd, leveled but still made up of distinct individualities like the sea of grains of sand that submerges the surface of the world. .. He sees that the world, nevertheless, continues to turn the boulder-back of its nature indifferent to the fate of mankind, its hard substance that cannot be reduced to human assimila- tion. . . He sees the forms in which the assembled human sand tends to arrange itself along lines of movement, patterns that combine regularity and fluidity like the rectilinear or circular tracks of a rake .. .And between mankind-sand and world-boulder there is a sense of possible harmony, as if between two non- homogeneous harmonies: that of the non-human in a balance of forces that seems not to correspond to any pattern, and that of human structures, which aspires to the rationality of a geometrical or musical composition, never definitive. .. (Pal- omar, p. 85) While Calvino cannot bring himself entirely to abandon the rational, the ideal, this last book of his powerfully and movingly traces the intrusion of the messily human, the sheer overwhelming complexity of nature which defies the best efforts of the human mind to contain it. This brings him to a position not so far from that of Herbert; the Polish poet is only too well aware of the failure of idealism, and calls for a recognition in literature and poetry of what is specifically human, the materiality of bodies and things, of joy and suffering, which are the lot of human experience. In Herbert's poem "Report From Paradise," a heavily ironic account of the workers' Paradise under Communist rule, the material world of bodies and things similarly undermines any heavenly aspirations: At first it was to have been different luminous circles choirs and degrees of abstraction but they were not able to separate exactly the soul from the flesh and so it would come here with a drop of fat a thread of muscle it was necessary to face the consequences to mix a grain of the absolute with a grain of clay one more departure from doctrine the last departure only John foresaw it: you will be resurrected in the flesh ("Report from Paradise") University of Strathclyde</page><page sequence="14">MLN 141 WORKS CONSULTED The selections from the 'Mr Cogito' poems are reprinted from Zbigniew Herbert, Report from a Besieged City, trans.
