<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BALD EAGLE: HAUNTS AND HABITS OF A WILDER- NESS MONARCH. A Smithsonian Nature Book. By Jon M. Gerrard and Gary R. Bortolotti. Smithso- nian Institution Press, Washington, D.C. $24.95 (hard- cover); $12.95 (paper). xvi + 177 p.; ill.; index. ISBN: 0-87474-450-4 (hc); 0-87474-4-51-2 (pb). 1988. This book is a compilation of personal notes and ob- servations of the authors, coupled with the latest in- formation on the biology and life history of the Bald Eagle. Each of the 12 chapters covers a different as- pect of existing knowledge on this endangered spe- cies, including food habits, nesting behavior, move- ments, and management. Written in a popular style, and not encumbered with lengthy tables of data, statistics, or scientific jargon, the information is nevertheless accurate and current, and the authors have managed to maintain scientific objectivity with-</page><page sequence="2">SEPTEMBER 1989 NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 355 out lapsing into anthropomorphic drivel, typical of popular writing on this symbolic and beautiful bird. Each chapter begins with a personal account from one of the two authors, detailing an experience or observation relating to the subject of the chapter. This is a unique and interesting way of grabbing the attention of the reader for what is to follow. Field biologists, especially those dealing with raptors, will find some of these experiences familiar, often hu- morous, and memorable. Most of the authors' work was done on Besnard Lake in Saskatchewan, Canada, although they have included observations and data from throughout the range of the Bald Eagle. The book is illustrated with black-and-white pho- tographs and a few line drawings. The photographs are excellent and serve well to illustrate and supple- ment the text. The only criticism I have relates to the references. Although there is a good bibliogra- phy at the end, the authors elected to cite informa- tion sources with numerical references relating to a separate chapter called "Notes," each chapter hav- ing its own sequence of numbers. I found it very cum- bersome to find the appropriate reference while en- gaged in reading the text. In summary, this is a book for layperson and scien- tist alike. It is thoroughly enjoyable and scientifi- cally appropriate. It will occupy a prominent place on my bookshelf. JOHN E. MATHISEN, Chippewa National Forest, Cass Lake, Minnesota BIRDS TO WATCH.
