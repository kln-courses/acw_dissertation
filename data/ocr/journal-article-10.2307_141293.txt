<plain_text><page sequence="1">ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY VOL. 21 JULY, 1945 No. 3 THE SEVEN AGES OF TOWNS Griffith Taylor T pHE early geographer William Morris Davis greatly clarified the study of topography by introducing the concept of the ages of various landscapes. He showed that an elevated area was slowly cut down to a rocky plain near sea level; and he gave anthropomorphic names (such as juvenile, senile) to these stages. The present writer in a recent address has made an attempt to do the same thing in regard to the usual development of an occidental city. In the case of the development of Toronto some of these new terms for stages of development are used as labels. In the earliest stage there is no clear differentiation between industrial commercial or residential areas. The first tendency is for the bigger houses to develop near the margins, where gardens and privacy are available. Factories of size have not yet been built. We see Toronto in this Infantile stage up to about 1818. In the next stage there is a fairly clear segregation of an extensive com- mercial quarter towards the centre of the town, including a number of streets without residences. But shops, offices, and small industries are still rather mixed. A definite zone of better class houses fringes the town. The poorer folk live near the centre; in many cases taking over the better houses of the former stage, but also building new small houses in any empty spaces. This may be called the Juvenile stage, and is illustrated around 1842 in Toronto. The beginning of adolescence is shown by a definite differentiation of the residences. The various types are dis- placed outward as the years move on, though naturally examples of early houses survive in the expanding zone. Until the first-class houses are segregated we may call the stage Adolescent. In Toronto in 1885 the best houses are still quite scattered and do not form a well- marked cluster or zone. The next stage is the Early Mature, where there are definite areas of first- class residences more or less approaching zones. But the factories are still much scattered. The effect of the numerous railways and of the infilling of the swamps in the last 20 years has given us the present plan. Toronto may now be said to be in the Mature stage of devel- opment. Perhaps we may use the term Late Mature for the Toronto of tomor- row, when the town-planners shall have regulated the present nondescript pat- tern, that is, cut radial roads, arranged the parklands, and made use of the ravines as recreational centres. The term Senile is used by the topographer to denote a landscape which is nearly worn down to sea level again (thatis,</page><page sequence="2">ECONOMIC GEOGRAPHY to a peneplain). In the case of City Evolution we may use this term for cities which have begun to show visible decay, with large built-up areas aban- doned. Such are almost unknown in our young American civilization, but Nanking in China is one of many such cities studied by the writer. It may be added that the landscapes along a large river like the Nile offer all types of topography. Juvenile along the cataracts, mature in Uganda, senile as the river flows over the delta. So also it is likely that in a modern "mega- lopolis" some districts may belong to a slightly different stage as compared with others. However in the average city it seems feasible to connote a good many common features by the use of the seven stages. I repeat them in tabular form below. there. The region which contains these large towns is extremely elongated, and serves to accentuate the importance of the water-borne traffic of olden days. It is shown by the close diagonal ruling in Figure 1, and extends from Cornwall in the northeast to Sarnia in the west. The two isolated patches at Ottawa and Niagara Falls are also obviously determined by water transport in part. The most interesting exception to the general rule mentioned above is found in the region just to the west of Hamil- ton. Here three of the four 3rd class towns (shown by rings) are not particu- larly close to the great waterways of the St. Lawrence or Ottawa. They are, however, situated on the banks of the two main rivers of this part of Ontario, that is, the Grand and the Thames; and this in part explains their origin. In THE SEVEN AGES OF TOWNS Infantile towns ...... Haphazard distribution of houses and shops, no factories. Juvenile ............ Differentiation of zones begins, that is shops separated. Adolescent ..........Scattered factories, no definite zone of Class I houses. Early Mature........ When there is a clear segregation of the first-class houses. Mature............. Separate commercial and industrial areas, four zones of houses. Late Mature........ The ordinary industrial city (paleotechnic of Mumford) after the town-planner has modified the main arteries and added parkways, etc. Detroit is approaching this condition. Senile ..............When considerable areas of the city have been abandoned, and the whole community has shrunk greatly in importance. (e. g. Nanking) THE TOWN PATTERN IN SOUTHERN ONTARIO In the last 150 years the settlement of Southern Ontario has become rela- tively stable. Although the population is increasing somewhat the general pattern is not altering notably, and it will be worth while to examine what are the components of the pattern, and how they fit into a preliminary regional plan. At the 1931 census there were four large towns in the region with over 100,000 inhabitants; four more with more than 25,000 inhabitants, and about a further score with more than 10,000 inhabitants. These are all plotted on the map appearing as Figure 1, and one quite striking feature is emphasized Ontario as elsewhere each town depends on various factors for its origin and growth, and indeed these change con- siderably in a hundred years. In the early nineteenth century the three little towns of York (Toronto), Port Credit, and Whitby all had much the same environment; being lake ports with a similar hinterland of forest and wheatfields. For a time, as long as the forests supplied abundant timber, and while the wheat was readily sold in the United States, the two smaller towns forged ahead fairly satisfactorily. But when these two staples of trade ceased to be profitable-owing to the passing of the forests and the adoption of new protective laws in the United States- 158</page><page sequence="3">THE SEVEN AGES OF TOWNS then Toronto's political advantage caused it to leave its humble rivals far behind. Let us now return to London, Kitch- ener, and Brantford, and study their growth. Like so many places in Canada early in the nineteenth century the most prominent feature of these little settle- ments was the grist or lumber mill or both. There was a continuous string of little towns all along the Grand River and its tributaries; for even a small tributary with the aid of a dam could supply power for one of these early mills. But this is not the sole reason, for, while Fergus, Preston, Gait, Paris, and Brant- ford are on the main river, Kitchener without any notable stream is the largest city of the basin. The coming of the railways made a great difference to the rate of growth. Kitchener (Berlin) received rail connection about 1850, while the nearby town of Waterloo did not have a railway until 1882; and this factor determined the site of many early factories. A second feature was the network of hydro-electric power radiating from Niagara Falls. This would seem to be equally advantageous for any of these Grand River towns; but as a matter of fact water supply and a resident labour population still give the older towns an advantage. Thus we may explain the growth of this cluster of big towns off the main St. Lawrence route, as being due originally to crossroads and (or) dam- sites. If railway facilities came along in the fifties or sixties, this gave certain of the little towns a great advantage in the opening years of the machinery age. The presence of excellent farm- lands in vicinity was common to all. The availability of Niagara power finally added to the railway importance of Kitchener, and made it the leader of the group. There is no other similar "constellation" of cities in Ontario 600,000 25 - oo, oOO n O 10- 2.5,000 -t S- 1 0,000 3 2oo -500 0 2 / ooo -25oo 5o500 -/000 Y-W--?-- 7gop ogr7,pA ,'= /, Am ; r FIGURE 1.-Distribution of towns in Southern Ontario, classified according to population in 1931.

Along the "strip of Cities'" from Corn- wall (Figure 1) to Sarnia, the big towns are strung out at rather regular intervals. Thus between Cornwall and Brockville in the east is about 50 miles, to Kingston is 45, to Belleville 43. Cobourg and Port Hope are close together, 40 miles further to the west; while 35 miles on is Oshawa. Then come Toronto and Hamilton each in 40 mile stages. We are now in the Hamilton "Constella- tion"; and Brantford, Woodstock, and London are only 30 miles apart on our strip of cities. The last three stages are London to Chatham 60 miles, Chatham to Windsor 45 miles, and finally (turning north up the Detroit River) we reach Sarnia after about 50 miles. The average distance between the 13 cities along our traverse is 41 miles. The two patches of fairly high density not yet considered are situated near Niagara Falls and Ottawa. The first of these patches has two or three great advantages. First is the proximity of the Falls themselves, with the advan- tages of a steady tourist traffic, as well as the low cost of power. Along the Ontario shore, just to the north, is the best orchard district in Ontario; while right through the district passes the great Welland Canal. This canal has a cluster of towns linked with it, of which four (St. Catharines, Welland, Thorold, and Port Colborne) are indi- cated on the map. Along the Ottawa River only the capital is of any size, but there are two towns of about 5,000, that is, Renfrew and Pembroke, which are farming centres based on the rather better "Ordovician-rock" soils of this district lying to the east of the Shield. Before considering the intermediate towns, a few moments may be given to the "empty" areas in Figure 1. These are readily explained by the structure, since they all lie on the some- what sterile granite rocks of the Cana- dian Shield. Only near the great north route from Toronto to North Bay are there any towns of note. Gravenhurst, Bracebridge, and Huntsville all depend very considerably on the tourist traffic in summer. The numerous lakes and the relatively untouched forest on the sterile Shield have naturally great attrac- tions for tourists from the settled areas to the south. These cool summer re- sorts draw many visitors from the United States. Bancroft, with its fa- mous "blue sodalite mines," is almost the sole large village in the remainder of the Shield. Parry Sound has its lake position and considerable lumber trade, and the same may be said for North Bay. It is worthy of note that the thriving farming district, to the north of the Hamilton-London "Constella- tion," contains no large towns, but supports 38 small towns (3,000 or less) in an area of 5,000 square miles. This gives us one small town for 130 square miles of farm land. 160</page></plain_text>
