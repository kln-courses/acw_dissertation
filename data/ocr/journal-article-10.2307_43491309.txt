Chris Manning The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States ABSTRACT Research on concealed deposits with ritual significance has been conducted by scholars in continental Europe, the British Isles, and Australia. Similar evidence of the material culture of magic and folk belief in the United States is presented, focusing on ritual deposits hidden within and around domestic structures associated with European American populations. Comparative analysis of three artifact types - witch bottles, concealed footwear, and cats - highlights discrepancies between ethnohistorical and archaeological evidence, and demonstrates temporal, geographical, and spatial patterns in ritual conceal- ments. An overview of other important artifact types illustrates the wide variety of material culture employed in folk rituals in European America. The article concludes with a discussion of regional variation in ritual concealments and the importance of family and household structure, geographic and cultural origin, and cosmology and worldview in private domestic ritual. The Archaeology of Ritual Concealments The tradition of placing magico-religious objects and symbols in and around buildings for spiritual protection and good luck has been documented throughout the world. This article examines the material evidence of ritual deposits in architectural contexts in the United States, focusing on artifacts concealed under or within the fabric of standing structures associated with people of European, primarily British and Irish, heritage. Extensive studies on this topic have been conducted in the British Isles and northern Europe (Ó Súilleabháin 1945; Sandklef 1949; Howard 1951; Merrifield 1954, 1955, 1987; Annable 1955; M.

Significantly less attention, however, has been paid to the topic in North America. Terms such as: "hoard," "cache," "founda- tion sacrifice," "foundation deposit," "votive deposit," "dedicated object," "special deposit," "structured deposit," and "building deposit" have all been used by scholars to describe a vari- ety of prehistoric and historical ritual deposits (Burdick 1901; Hartland 1937; Ó Súilleabháin 1945; Schiffer 1987:79; Bradley 1998:xviii-xix; Leone and Fry 1999; Leone et al. 2001; Cun- liffe 2003:145-149; Osborne 2004; Hamerow 2006; Groot 2009; Herva and Ylimaunu 2009; Hukantaival 2009; Yates and Bradley 2010). The terms "ritual concealment," "concealed object," and "concealed deposit," as well as the more specific "concealed shoe" and "concealed cat," are preferred by the author because they explic- itly indicate the deliberate nature of the deposits and denote an object that has been purposefully hidden. Considering the secrecy surrounding these deposits, and the fact that few historical records describe the practice of hiding objects within the fabric of buildings, the use of these terms seems appropriate. Thus, for the purpose of this paper, a "ritual concealment" is defined as a deposit of one or more artifacts deliberately hidden within the structure of a building as part of a magico-religious or secular folk ritual. A significant number of ritual concealments is associated with the spiritual and physical pro- tection and well-being of the house, its occu- pants, and the surrounding homestead, including the outbuildings and livestock, although some deposits may have been used in healing magic, harmful magic ( maleficium ), or love magic, or represent a secular ritual practiced by members of the building trades.

CHRIS MANNING - The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 53 other historical sources) indicate that ritual concealments and other forms of folk magic were widespread in the British Isles and north- ern Europe during the late medieval period, continuing into the early 20th century (Mer- rifield 1987). Folk magic and belief in witches, demons, spirits, ghosts, fairies, familiars, and other supernatural beings, along with other manifestations of cosmological and ideological expression, certainly accompanied European immigrants to North America. In the United States, hundreds of artifacts have been found deliberately concealed within standing structures, many with known parallels in the Old World; however, they have received little attention from American archaeologists so far, with some notable exceptions. Although the topic has not received as much attention as it has in Europe, American scholars have made important contributions to the study of ritual concealments and other evidence of European American folk belief, most notably Becker (1978, 1980, 2005), Painter (1980), Alexandrowicz (1986), King (1996), St. George (1998:188-195), Fennell (2000, 2007), May (2001), Costello (Geisler 2003), Augé (2006, 2007, 2008, 2009), McKitrick (2009), More- house (2009), and Rivers Cofield (2010). How- ever, other than Costello 's study of concealed footwear, Becker's research on witch bottles, and McKitrick's limited survey of the archaeol- ogy of magic in Maryland, few attempts have been made to assemble and analyze physical data from multiple sites. Such analysis is sorely needed in order to identify temporal, geographic, and spatial patterns that may assist with identifi- cation and interpretation of deposits; see Easton (this issue) and Costello (this issue). Witch Bottles The European magico-religious artifact that has received the most attention from North American archaeologists is the witch bottle, part of a well-documented folk ritual that involves constructing a charm to counter a bewitchment. The witch-bottle tradition originated in the East Anglia region of England in the late Middle Ages and was introduced to North America by colonial immigrants, the tradition continuing well into the 20th century on both sides of the Atlantic (Merrifield 1954, 1955, 1987; Becker 2005; Rieti 2008). While nearly 200 examples have been documented in Great Britain (Hog- gard 2004), less than a dozen are known in the United States (Becker 1978, 2005; Painter 1980, Alexandrowicz 1986; King 1996; Morehouse 2009; Manning 2012:108-118). The effectiveness of a witch bottle relied on the physical connection thought to exist between witch or wizard and victim. Witch bottles were employed for a variety of reasons, but primarily as a magical folk remedy for illness or injury believed to be caused by bewitchment, especially urinary or kidney problems, such as nephritis, bladder infections, kidney stones, and, less commonly, epilepsy or "fits" (Latham 1878:25; Kittredge 1956:103; I. Evans 1966:79- 80; Thomas 1971:543-544; Merrifield 1987). It was believed that by enclosing the victim's urine and other exuviae in a bottle along with pins, nails, or other sharp objects, the witch would experience sympathetic pain and difficulty urinating (Merrifield 1954:4). Heating the concoction was thought to intensify the efficacy of the countermeasure, often resulting in the witch's death. A witch bottle could also be used to identify the person responsible for the bewitchment by compelling him or her to appear at the house of the victim, usually in an agitated state, sometimes displaying symptoms or wounds caused by the countercharm, such as burns or scratches on the face (Merrifield 1955:207, 1987:172; Kittredge 1956:99; Godbeer 1992:46). There is also some indication that witch bottles were used as preemptive apotropaic devices to defend houses from supernatural attack (Latham 1878:25-26; Moore 1892; Godbeer 1992:45). Although ethnohistorical and archaeologi- cal evidence suggests a common recipe for a witch bottle - usually urine along with some combination of pins, needles, or nails - Merri- field (1954:14) notes that in England numerous examples have been found to contain ingredi- ents not mentioned in ethnohistorical sources. In fact, examples recovered archaeologically demonstrate that a wide variety of materials was used in witch bottles, depending on the nature of the affliction, the materials at hand, and the ingenuity of the person who assembled the countercharm. Materials that have been reported in witch bottles and other types of bottle charms include fabric and leather hearts pierced with pins and needles, human hair,</page><page sequence="3">54 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) fingernail clippings, brass studs, a table fork, the tine of a rake, glass chips, sulfur, tallow, balls of clay, slivers of wood, matches, bone, twisted wire, thorns, knotted string, thread, pages from books, and written spells (Lake 1954:113; Merri- field 1954, 1955, 1987; Dent 1962; Smedley and Owles 1964; Farley 1978; Maloney 1980; Walker 1987:113; Winzar 1995; Copson 1996; Massey and Edmonds 2000; Hoggard 2004; Pitts 2009:7). Only eight possible witch bottles have been reported in the United States (Table 1), with more than half the specimens coming from the mid- Atlantic region (Becker 2005; Manning 2012). Like other types of ritual concealments, witch bottles are often found in and around domestic spaces, particularly near hearths, chimneys, and thresholds, and less frequently in walls and other structural voids. Ethnohistorical accounts indicate that the witch-bottle tradition has considerable cultural continuity in the United States, with descriptions of use among European Americans dating from the colonial period through the early 20th century (Table 2). One of the most difficult tasks historical archaeologists face is accurately identifying witch bottles (or any ritual artifact) in the archaeological record. Becker (2005:21) has noted that the relatively few reported examples of American witch bottles "may reflect a lack of understanding of the artifact type by investigators rather than a paucity of examples," emphasizing that "it is important to consider the bottle type, contents, location, and placement." Based on documented witch bottles in Eng- land and the United States, and ethnohistorical evidence from both sides of the Atlantic, a sug- gested typology for American witch bottles has been developed (Table 3). Types are identified by physical characteristics, such as vessel form, con- tents, and special features. Further classification based on spatial context (location and position) could expand the typology, but is not included at this time. The resulting typology highlights discrepancies between the archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence, and may facilitate iden- tification and interpretation of future discoveries. Examples of Type A witch bottles - none of which has yet been reported in the United States, but which have been documented in England and in American ethnohistorical sources - consist of vessels that contain, or once contained, urine, with no additional ingredients. This type can be further divided by vessel into Subtype A-l, ceramic jugs (Bellarmines); Subtype A-2, glass wine or case bottles; and Subtype A-3, small glass medicine vials. Type B witch bottles include ceramic jugs (Subtype B-l), glass wine or case bottles (Subtype B-2), and small glass medicine vials (Subtype B-3) containing some combination of pins, needles, or nails. These bottles may or may not have also contained urine. There are six documented exam- ples of this type in the United States, with three examples of Subtype B-2 and three of Subtype B-3. Subtype B-4, consisting of an open vessel, such as a pot or pan in which pins, needles, or nails are boiled urine over a fire, is also included here, although this form is not a witch bottle per se, but a closely related charm. Type C witch bottles are distinguished from Type B bottles by the presence of a fabric or leather heart pierced with pins or nails, and could, if required, be further divided into sub- types by vessel form. There is one example of this type from the United States. Type D witch bottles are identified by the presence of pins and/ or needles stuck directly into the cork, a method that seems to be localized to southwestern Eng- land (Merrifield 1987:180-181). This type could also be subdivided by vessel form. There is one known example of a Type D witch bottle in the United States. Type E witch bottles could be described as a more generalized bottle charm and include all other known examples that deviate from the above-described pattern. This would include examples reported from England that contain lumps of clay, animal tallow, and colored string. Type E bottles may not be considered witch bottles, but instead represent other types of bottle charms that have yet to be classified. The final variation on the witch bottle in the United States is Type F, which includes jugs, bottles, and vials with no evidence of the expected urine, pins, needles, or nails. While usually found empty, such examples may also contain water or alcohol. These apparently mundane artifacts are commonly corked or otherwise sealed, and are difficult to recognize in the archaeological record. A comparison of archaeological evidence of witch bottles and ethnohistorical descriptions of their use highlights gaps in the understanding of the custom in the United States, as shown in Table 3. Several discrepancies become apparent. For example, although no reported witch bottles</page><page sequence="4">M.

Furthermore, seven different sources describe the use of witch bottles containing only urine, with no mention made of pins, needles, nails, or other contents. This suggests that archae- ologists may have overlooked potential witch bottles simply because they did not contain the expected materials. As Merrifield (1955:196) points out: "[Bļottles which originally contained urine alone are of course less easily recognized as witch charms, and must often have escaped notice." It should also be noted that while examples of Types C and D have been recov- ered archaeologically, these variations are not explicitly mentioned in ethnohistorical sources, demonstrating how archaeology can add to the understanding of the witch-bottle tradition in the United States. The discrepancy in the number of Type F witch bottles reported - bottles that appear</page><page sequence="7">58 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) empty or contain liquid other than urine, but no artifacts - compared to the complete lack of physical examples, deserves discussion. In England, empty bottles or bottles containing unidentified liquid are frequently found in standing structures: behind walls, under floorboards, and concealed in cavities in and around the chimney (G. Evans 1966:80; Merrifield 1987; Orr 2005). Ethnohistorical evidence indicates that sealed bottles concealed in building voids - even when pins, needles, nails, and urine are not present - may represent a reduced form of the witch bottle. In such cases, context is crucial to identification. Sealed bottles in architectural voids, particularly near hearths and doorways, are likely candidates for this type of witch bottle. For example, an empty glass bottle, tightly corked with a large pentagram on one side, was found concealed in the soffit of the Raitt Homestead Farm Museum in Eliot, Maine (Lisa Raitt 2011, elee, comm.). Chemical analysis of the residue in the bottle, which has yet to be conducted, may help determine whether this artifact was used as a witch bottle, but its appearance and context alone highly suggest that it was. Witch bottles are an important artifact type because they are well documented in the ethno- historical record. The methods of construction, contents, reasons for their use, and how and by whom they were employed are all known; thus, they effectively demonstrate the temporal, geographic, and contextual scope of an artifact with known ritual significance. This knowledge may assist in the identification of other ritual deposits from similar contexts. Witch bottles are also important in that they demonstrate the per- sistence of magical traditions among Americans of European descent. In fact, the continuation of the witch-bottle tradition into the 20th century makes a strong case for the possibility that other European magico-religious rituals, includ- ing those which are largely absent from the his- torical record, also continued in North America long past the supposed decline in magical belief in the late 18th century. Additionally, witch bottles, and the closely related conjure bottles of the African diaspora, offer an opportunity to explore the ways in which cognitive aspects of European and West African cultures intersected in North America to create a syncretic and multivalent system of magical belief and ritual. Concealed Footwear By far the most common ritual artifacts con- cealed in and around domestic structures are shoes and boots. There are approximately 2,000 known cases of concealed footwear worldwide; however, unlike witch bottles, there are very few historical accounts describing the practice. It is widely believed that concealed footwear served an apotropaic function, protecting the home and its occupants from malevolent forces, bad luck, and misfortune, or offering good luck and prosperity (Merrifield 1987; Hoggard 2004; I. Evans 2010; Costello, this issue). In her 2003 master's thesis, Jessica Costello (Geisler 2003) compiled data on 106 deposits of concealed footwear in the United States, obtained in part from the Northampton Muse- um's Concealed Shoe Index in Northampton, England, and from records kept by Historic New England (formerly the Society for the Preserva- tion of New England Antiquities). Expanding on Costello 's work, the author has identified more than 150 additional cases of concealed footwear in the United States, bringing the total number of documented deposits to 259 (and counting), consisting of at least 568 individual pieces of footwear from 234 sites (Manning 20 ^appen- dix A). Temporal analysis of American shoe conceal- ments shows an increase in frequency in the mid- 19th century. While deposits are concen- trated in New England, the Delaware Valley, and the upper Chesapeake, examples have been reported as far south as Louisiana and as far west as California and Oregon (Figure 1). The majority of concealments (78%, n=201) comes from domestic structures, although deposits have also been found in public buildings, includ- ing both the Indiana and Kansas statehouses (Manning 2012:203-204). The most frequently reported locations for concealed footwear are inside a wall (24%, n=62) and around the hearth or chimney (24%, n=61), followed by other liminal spaces, such as the roof and attic (17%), within floors and ceilings (8%), and surrounding doors and windows (7%). Interest- ingly, concealed footwear is almost never found in foundations. The majority of concealed footwear consists of a single shoe or boot, although deposits of multiple shoes or "families" are not uncommon</page><page sequence="8">M. CHRIS MANNING - The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 59 FIGURE 1. Geographic distribution of concealed footwear in the United States. (Map by author and Marco A. González, 2014.) (Swann 1969:8, 1998:2, 2005:116). Ofthose deposits consisting of a single shoe, 57 cases belonged to children, while 66 have been identi- fied as adult shoes. Single adult shoes consist of 29 women's, 27 men's, and 10 shoes for which the intended gender was unknown. It should be noted that in some cases it is difficult to deter- mine whether a shoe belonged to a large child (sub-adult) or to a small man or woman, and in other cases the shoes are of a vernacular style that is not gender specific. Overall, these ratios are notably similar to those reported for Australia (I. Evans 2010:135) and worldwide (Pitt 1998). By a ratio of more than 2:1, there appears to be a preferential selection of left-footed shoes (69%, n=29) over right-footed shoes (31%, n=13). Many ethnohistorical accounts, particularly those found in African American folklore, specify a prefer- ence in magical charms for the left shoe, rein- forcing the symbolic significance of left-footed shoes in ritual concealments. For a discussion of the symbolic significance of left and right in European cosmology, see Augé (2012) and Man- ning (2012). As noted by Costello (this issue), nearly all examples of concealed shoes, boots, and slippers are well worn, showing evidence of heavy wear, repair, or alteration. In addition, some examples display clear signs of deliberate destruction that are not so easily explained. At the John A. Rowland House in Hacienda Heights, California, a late- 19th-century man's shoe, carefully and deliberately cut in half, was found between two floor joists (Figure 2). A nearly identical half- shoe concealment was discovered in the "Old Dorm" at the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. It would have takén considerable effort to cut through the soles and uppers of these shoes in such a manner, and it is difficult to provide a mundane explanation for such a deliberate, destructive act. Costello (this issue) and Merrifield (1987) suggest that such</page><page sequence="9">60 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) FIGURE 2. Concealed shoes deliberately cut in half.

Right, shoe found in the "Old Dorm" at Lutheran Theological Seminary, Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. (Photo by B. Bohleke, 2012; courtesy Gettysburg Seminary Ridge Museum.) examples may represent maleficium or a ritual "killing" of the shoes. In addition to isolated shoe concealments and deposits of "families," concealed footwear has also been found in association with other arti- facts, primarily garments and common household objects. One such deposit, discovered in the Strong House in Amherst, Massachusetts, con- tained several shoes, a man's legging, a single glove, and a Bible (Manning 2012). At the Latourette-Clement House in Montgomery, New York, five odd shoes, pages from a Bible, two mismatched socks, a woman's glove, a carv- ing knife, broken ceramics, and other assorted artifacts were found together inside a plaster wall. Similar deposits have been observed throughout the British Isles (Annable 1955; Dixon-Smith 1990; Easton, 1997b, this issue; Bennett 2006). While at first glance these multi- artifact assemblages appear to be random refuse, closer examination reveals a pattern consisting of some combination of shoes, garments or textile fragments, printed and written materi- als (particularly religious texts and almanacs), broken glass and ceramics, and other assorted household objects, all worn and well used, often broken or incomplete (Table 4). As Easton (1997b, this issue) has suggested, such deposits may represent "spiritual middens" placed "by the homes' occupants to protect the households from supernatural attack. Although there are very few historical descrip- tions of shoe concealment, it is clear that old shoes possessed ritual significance among Euro- pean and European American populations, as thoroughly discussed by Costello (this issue). The most popular interpretation of shoe con- cealment is that it served an apotropaic func- tion, protecting the household from supernatural attack. As late as the 1940s, it was reported in Suffolk, England, that "shoes placed at a door, one going in, one out, will prevent nightmares,"</page><page sequence="10">M.

The tale of English rector John Schorn, who sometime around the year 1300 was reputed to have forced the Devil into a boot, is frequently cited as the origin of the apotropaic use of shoes. It was Merrifield (1987) who first sug- gested that Schorn's miraculous feat inspired a general belief in the ability of shoes and boots to trap malevolent spirits or to function as a general prophylactic charm to guard the vulner- able openings of a building. However, as James Davidson (2010:633) points out: "[I]t is not entirely clear whether or not the use of a shoe or boot as a means to trap evil originated with Schorn, or if he was simply invoking a com- monly recognized symbol of the day." Although the oldest reported concealed shoe, dated ca. 1308, was found in Winchester Cathedral in Hampshire, England, deposits of concealed foot- wear, clothing, and related objects dating to the 14th century have also been found elsewhere in Europe (Atzbach 2001, 2005, 2006, 2012), sug- gesting that the tradition of shoe and garment concealment was widely established throughout northern Europe by the late Middle Ages. Analysis of the surviving images of Schorn also suggests that the supernatural creature con- veyed into the boot, or perhaps repelled by the boot, was not the Devil so much as a devil - a lesser demon, goblin, familiar, fairy, or other malevolent or mischievous nonhuman being widely found in the cosmologies of northern Europe (Manning 2012:164-167). The earliest description of offerings of shoes and clothing</page><page sequence="11">62 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) to such nonhuman beings appears in Germany in the 11th century, well before Schorn's time, when Burchard, the bishop of Worms, prescribed penance for the sin of placating domestic spirits: Hast thou made little, boys' size bows and boys' shoes, and cast them into thy storeroom or thy barn so that satyrs or goblins might sport with them, in order that they might bring to thee the goods of others so that thou shouldst become richer? If thou hast, thou shalt do penance for ten days on bread and water. (McNeill and Gamer 1990:335) More recent ethnohistorical evidence through- out the British Isles and northern Europe, from Ireland to western Russia, consistently associates house spirits, familiars, fairies, and other nonhu- man beings with articles of clothing, particularly shoes, stockings, caps, and cloaks. Some of these supernatural beings are attracted to shoes and clothing, like the Russian domovoi , who preferred old bast shoes placed near the stove in which to make its home (Singleton 1997:24). (A bast shoe is a type of traditional slipper woven from the inner bark, or bast, of a birch or linden tree, once commonly worn by peasants in Eastern Europe.) In Lithuania, peasants made tiny cloaks for the kaukas , a helpful household spirit similar to the domovoi , and buried the cloaks in the floors of their cottages (Ralston 1872:122). In the British Isles, helpful domestic spirits and fairies, such as the brownie and hob, as well as the more mali- cious boggart, are said to be repelled or "laid" by a gift of clothing, while the Irish leprechaun was tasked with making and repairing shoes (Briggs 1953; Winberry 1976:63). Garments turned inside out or put on backwards are also cited as an effective way to repel fairies and witches (Briggs 1976:335). Throughout northern Europe, domestic spirits such as the domovoi and hob are associated with the chimney and hearth, and less frequently the threshold, walls, attic, or barn, where offerings of milk, cream, bread, porridge, beer, or, less com- monly, a chicken were placed. The best known connection between supernatu- ral spirits and shoes or other garments comes in the form of the many customs found throughout northern Europe and the United States in which good behavior is rewarded by some watchful spirit in the form of a small gift left in a shoe or stocking. In the British Isles, a dairymaid or servant who has pleased the fairies or resident house spirit might find a sixpence in her shoe (Buchanan-Brown 1972:203; Rivers Cofield 2010, this issue), which was comparable to the wide- spread custom of setting out a shoe or stocking for a visiting spirit during winter celebrations. The spirit, usually portrayed as an old bearded man, an elven nonhuman being, or an elderly woman, can be seen in a host of traditions, including Father Christmas in England and St. Nicholas or Sinter- klaas in the Netherlands (H. Davidson 1970:183). In Scandinavia, the tomte and nisse, both domestic spirits related to the English hob, are said to fill the same role. Such visiting winter spirits reward good behavior with gifts of coins, sweets, or other small niceties, and may leave ashes, coal, switches, or rods for those who exhibit unaccept- able behavior (H. Davidson 1970:183). As with the household spirits, the rituals associated with these winter beings consistently center around the hearth and chimney; in some cases the spirit is said to enter the house through the chimney (H. Davidson 1970:183). As with the domestic spirits, an offering of milk, cake, bread, cookies, or por- ridge is commonly left for the visitor. The apotropaic power of shoes is also described in European American folklore. In his collection of folklore from Adams County, Illinois, Hyatt (1935:538,635) reported that old shoes should be burnt for good luck, to repel ghosts, and to "keep the witches away." It was also said that, "to cure nightmare, set your shoes at the foot of the bed with the toes pointing away from the bed" (Hyatt 1935:294). Even as late as the 1950s, an informant in Alabama claimed that placing one's shoes under the bed, one toe turned out and one turned under, would "keep evil spirits away at night" (Browne 1958:195). According to one German American informant: "If someone comes to your house and you think they are a witch and you don't want them to come in, lay an old shoe in the door; and if she is a witch, they cannot step over the shoe," indicating that in some situations a shoe might serve as a physical barrier to the nocturnal visits of witches, spirits, and other supernatural creatures (Hyatt 1935:538). Hyatt (1935:538-539) recorded the following tale from another of his German American informants: A woman came to see a man every night and stayed until twelve o'clock, and when she would leave he would be sick all night and could not sleep. He went and told another man. He said, "That old woman has you bewitched. I would fix her. The next time she comes, you put a pair of your shoes down in the door; and if she has you bewitched, she cannot get over those shoes to go home." So that night when she came, he</page><page sequence="12">FIGURE 3. Early-20th-century British postcards depicting lucky horseshoes, old shoes, and a black cat. (Photo by author, 2013.) M. CHRIS MANNING- The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 63 put his shoes in the door. She tried to go home but could not go through the door. He let the shoes stay in the door until four o'clock in the morning, then picked the shoes up. She went home but never did come again. The man got well and could sleep fine after that. Although there is a clear association between footwear, clothing, and supernatural beings in both European and European American folklore, only one source explicitly describes the practice of concealing footwear within the fabric of a house as part of an apotropaic folk ritual. A late- 19th-century article titled "Superstitions of the Negro" reported that "to have about a house some place of deposit for old shoes, and therein to keep all the worn-out leather of the household, will bring good luck to the family" (Shepard 1888). Although shoe concealment in this context is ascribed to African Americans, the abundant physical and ethnohistorical evi- dence indicates a European origin and supports a ritual, and perhaps apotropaic, function for shoe concealment. As noted by Costello (this issue), concealed footwear is found in a variety of arrangements, including single-shoe deposits, multi-shoe deposits, multicomponent deposits containing a wide range of associated artifacts, and shoes that have been cut, slashed, hung, or otherwise mutilated. While many cases of concealed footwear appear to have been deposited by the occupants of a building for supernatural protec- tion, there is considerable evidence to indicate that, by the late 19th century, the practice had largely evolved into a secular ritual intended to bring good luck to the household (Figure 3). Easton (1997b), I. Evans (2010), Costello (this issue), and others (Swann 1996) have also shown that the ritual was adopted by members of the building trades, particularly masons and plasters, who were almost certainly responsible for the concealment of footwear in important public structures As with witch bottles, a typology has been developed for concealed footwear to help iden- tify and interpret deposits, accounting for variety of both the deposits themselves and the range of possible interpretations. Type A deposits are the simplest form and consist of either a single shoe or a matched pair from a single individual (man, woman, or child). This form is the most common manifestation of the concealed-shoe ritual in the United States and likely represents a reduced form of an older magico-religious charm. It can be found in almost any loca- tion within any building or structure, and usu- ally dates to the original construction episode or a major renovation or addition. Although homeowners may have concealed some Type A deposits, the single-shoe concealment was particularly popular among builders as a general good-luck charm or as an informal consecra- tion ritual. As a result, Type A deposits are</page><page sequence="13">64 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) commonly found in public structures, such as libraries, schools, and government buildings, that most likely employed professional craftsmen in their construction. Type B deposits include single shoes or small groups of shoes associated with one or two other magico-religious objects, or those in which one or more of the shoes has been deliberately manipulated, mutilated, or otherwise altered, such as the two shoes cut in half. This type of deposit suggests a specific and highly personal charm, countercharm, remedy, or curse directed toward a particular individual with the intent to heal, harm, or control. The third type of shoe concealment can be divided into three subtypes that appear to have served a similar function related to private domestic ritual and the protection and wellbeing of the household. Deposits of the C-l subtype consist of "families" of shoes, wherein a single shoe or, less likely, a pair of shoes from each member of a household are concealed together. Subtype C-l deposits generally have some com- bination of men's, women's, and children's shoes, all dating to the same approximate time period. They are usually not accompanied by additional artifacts. Deposits of the C-2 subtype include spiritual middens or large multi-artifact features that include at least one shoe. As Easton (this issue) has noted, such deposits are usually located near a chimney or fireplace and are often accessible via an opening in the attic. Many C-2 deposits appear to have been maintained over a long period of time or were reopened periodically to accept new additions or to "recharge" the deposit's magical efficacy, particularly upon a change in the home's ownership, which can be seen in the stratigraphy of the deposit (Easton, this issue). While shoes, clothing, and other leather items are most prevalent in such deposits, other mundane or magico-religious artifacts are also found. Some C-2 deposits contain a variety of objects with known apotropaic functions, such as horseshoes, iron tools and implements, sharp and jagged objects, religious texts and almanacs, fragments of burnt wood, and the remains of cats or birds, particularly domestic fowl, such as chickens and geese. Deposits of the C-2 sub- type may have functioned as apotropaic armor intended to protect a building and its occupants from supernatural attack, as suggested by Easton (this issue); as a "nest" of items intended to attract, placate, or propitiate a house spirit; or as a method of consecrating and imbuing the home with the protective "spirit" of the family (Manning 2012). Subtype C-3 deposits are similar to Subtype C-2 deposits in that they contain a variety of personal objects in addition to shoes; however, C-3 deposits are different in that they represent a single depositional episode, usually sealed and inaccessible, and thus were not continuously added to over time. Some C-3 deposits resemble an informal time capsule or consecration deposit placed by either the occupants of a house or the builders and, as such, may be related to Type A deposits. They may be found anywhere in the building, but are usually located within sealed voids dating to the original construction or to a period of major repair or renovation. The preliminary typology outlined above may assist in the identification and interpretation of concealed footwear and associated deposits by emphasizing the possible variations that can be expected. Like that created for witch bottles, this typology highlights patterns that may assist historical archaeologists in achieving a better understanding of the material evidence of Euro- pean folk ritual in the United States. Concealed Cats One of the more unusual artifact types found in ritual concealments includes the bodies of cats. Most appear to have been either naturally or artificially preserved and are described as "mum- mified," "desiccated," "ossified," or "smoked" by those who discover them (Merrifield 1987:129; Sheehan 1990:65). Although the term "dried cat" is widely employed by scholars (Sheehan 1990:65), examples have also been reported in a skeletal state or taxidermied (Pennick 1986:11; Manning 2012); therefore, the more general term "concealed cat" is used in this article. As with concealed footwear, numerous examples of concealed cats have been found in standing structures in the British Isles and north-central Europe (Howard 1951; Pennick 1986; Merrifield 1987:129-131; Sheehan 1990; Hoggard 2004; Schad 2005), suggesting a possible Anglo-Saxon or Norse origin for the custom. Hoggard (2004:176) reports 139 documented cases in England, adding that there are anecdotal</page><page sequence="14">M. CHRIS MANNING - The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 65 records for many more cases that have yet to be confirmed. Schad (2005) has documented more than 50 dried cats in the German state of Baden- Württemberg, 39 from the district of Ludwigsburg alone. I. Evans (2010) has documented 17 cases of concealed cats in Australia. While the exact number of cat concealments worldwide is unknown, the available evidence indicates well over 200 cases have been identified. There is an obvious difficulty in dating con- cealed cat specimens; however, the practice appears to have been relatively common in Europe by at least the late Middle Ages, endur- ing into the 20th century in some areas (Sheehan 1990). Although concealed cats have been found in a variety of structures, they are most com- monly encountered in domestic contexts (Sheehan 1990:66; Schad 2005; I. Evans 2010:164-172). Deposits in ecclesiastical buildings are also common. While there has been considerable skepticism regarding the deliberate nature of these deposits, the physical evidence clearly indicates that cats were intentionally immured in buildings. For example, a number of concealed cats have been found accompanied by desiccated rats, mice, and birds, often posed as if in the midst of an attack or chase, or positioned with their prey in their mouths (Sheehan 1990:66). Others have been found artificially posed, pinned down, tied, or otherwise manipulated. In some instances the cats have been found in special cavities created specifically for the purpose of concealment. Some specimens have been found in association with artifacts, such as shoes, household objects, and botanical materials (Easton, this issue), although such multicomponent assemblages are not as common as the isolated cat find. Although a few sensationalized accounts of cat concealments claim the animals were walled in alive (Hartland 1937:113; Pennick 1986:11), most scholars agree that the available evidence indicates postmor- tem concealment (Sheehan 1990:66; Hoggard 2004:176; Schad 2005). Unlike witch bottles and concealed footwear, which have begun to receive attention from American researchers, the folk ritual of immuring cats in buildings has been largely overlooked. Research by the author identified nearly 40 cases of dried, "mummified," or skeletal remains of cats uncovered in buildings in the United States. In about two-thirds of the cases the possibility of accidental entrapment and natural death could not be excluded; therefore, such cases were given the benefit of the doubt and assumed to be accidental. The remaining 14 cases are indicative of deliberate concealment (Table 5). In the United States, half the specimens (n=7) come from the mid-Atlantic region, although they are also found in the Upper Midwest and, unlike concealed footwear, are noticeably absent from New England. The majority of deposits appear to have been concealed during an original con- struction episode and are found in sealed voids that have not been accessible since that time. Temporal analysis of the 11 cases for which an approximate date can be assigned reveals that the highest frequency of cases dates to the late 19th century (n=5), followed by the mid- 19th century (n=3). These data loosely resemble the temporal distribution of concealed footwear, which also peaked in the 19th century. In the United States, the types of structures and contexts where concealed cats have been found are similar to finds in the British Isles and else- where in Europe. More than half were reported from domestic structures (n=8), one example was reported in a church, and another was discovered in a domestic structure affiliated with a religious organization. Almost half the cases (n=6) were associated with the subfloor or foundation area, followed in frequency by wall deposits (n=4). This is markedly different from concealed shoes and boots, which are seldom found near founda- tions and are more commonly associated with the wall or hearth (Manning 2012). As in the British Isles, American cat conceal- ments include specimens accompanied by pre- served rats, mice, and birds, sometimes arranged in attack or predatory positions. For example, in 1950, a "mummified" cat was found inside the wall of a buggy shed attached to the Davy-Nelson House in Moorhead, Minnesota {Fargo Forum 1950). The cat was accompanied by the preserved body of a mouse, which was positioned in its mouth, and an 1876 newspaper, which predates the construction of the house by several years. A similar find was reported in Charlotte, North Carolina, where a dried cat, found in the wall of a late- 19th-century rooming house, was standing on all fours as if preparing to pounce on a dried rat found next to it ( Charlotte News 1948). Other specimens have been found in specially built cavities and unusual contexts, indicating</page><page sequence="15">66 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) TABLE 5 CONCEALED CATS IN THE UNITED STATES Location Date Description Context Type Berkeley, CA Ca. 1910 Dried cat propped in standing Hollow cavity in B position with one paw foundation under outstretched front door Fortville, IN Late 1800s Taxidermied cat standing Wall above door from C on all fours foyer to living room Raisin School, Ca. 1859 "Mummified" cat with Under building in A Adrian, MI "mummified" woodpecker sealed stone foundation Davy-Nelson House, Ca. 1883 "Mummified" cat with a Wall of attached A Moorhead, MN mouse in its mouth; 1 876 carriage house newspaper IIIS.

CHRIS MANNING - The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 67 postmortem placement. At the John Carlyle House in Alexandria, Virginia, a dried cat was found bricked up inside a chimney foundation, accompanied by sprigs of rosemary (Fauber Garbee, Inc. 1980; Bartlinski 2005:2) (Figure 4). According to the report of investigations: [A]t first it was assumed that the cat had crawled into the flue and died; but upon further investigation, it was evident that the cat had been interred in a masonry cavity. As the body was partially mummified, with the skin and fur intact, it can be assumed that the cavity was airtight. (Fauber Garbee, Inc. 1980:ix- 28) In the Germantown neighborhood of Phila- delphia, a cat was discovered embedded in the ceiling plaster of the now-demolished Method- ist Episcopal Church ( Moulton Tribune 1900). Farther west, in Indiana, Pennsylvania, the pre- served body of a cat was discovered inside a joist hole at the Houck Hotel {Indiana Evening Gazette 1938). This particular concealment is reminiscent of two cases reported by Merrifield (1987:131): in one, a cat was found lodged under a roof timber, and in another, a cat was found with its neck compressed by a roof joist. During recent renovations to the Ohio State- house, a late- 19th-century shoebox, containing the disarticulated and partial skeletal remains of a cat, was discovered behind the plaster wall in the cupola at the top of the rotunda (Chris Matheney 2011, elee. comm.). By no stretch of the imagination can this particular deposit be interpreted as an accidental entrapment. Various theories have been proposed as to why cats were deliberately concealed in build- ings. These theories range from a method for scaring away rodents to a charm to protect a house from evil spirits and familiars, a reduced form of foundation sacrifice, and as a general good-luck charm. The rodent-scare theory is based on the fact that, historically, cats have served an important role in pest control. Howard (1951:151) suggests that because cats were widely valued for their ability to control infes- tations, "this appreciation may, later on, have led to the idea that the enclosing of a cat in FIGURE 4. Concealed cat found in the John Carlyle House, Alexandria, Virginia, photographed shortly after discovery during restoration in the 1970s. (Courtesy Northern Virginia Regional Park Authority.)</page><page sequence="17">68 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) the walls of a house would protect the building from vermin." Although no folklore regarding the use of the bodies of cats as charms against vermin was encountered during the author's research, the connection between cats and rodents is otherwise well established. Frequently the mundane attributes of an object - in this case, the role of the cat as vermin catcher - can influence its use as a charm or folk remedy (Linn, this issue; Rivers Cofield, this issue). The fact that numerous specimens have been reported in association with rodents and birds, particularly in cases where the cats and their prey are deliberately posed in aggressive pos- tures, supports this theory. An alternate theory, as proposed by Merrifield (1987:131) and reiterated by Hoggard (2004), Schad (2005), and I. Evans (2010:171-172), is that cats may have been concealed to ward off spirits, witches, and, in particular, witches' familiars or "spiritual vermin." Another popu- lar theory maintains that cats were immured in buildings as a form of foundation sacrifice (Howard 1951; Merrifield 1987:131; Shee- han 1990:68; Hoggard 2004:176). Hoggard (2004:176) reports that, while collecting data for his survey of ritual concealments in Eng- land, several informants confided their belief that cats were sacrificed "to the building itself, to give it a life so that it will not take one later through some kind of tragic accident." Early-20th-century Danish historian Gudmund Schütte (1924:363) also claimed that, in the 19th century, "Jutlandic peasants buried a cat or a viper under the threshold, in order that the soul of the dead animal might become the 'wight' [spirit] or vare of the house." Sheehan (1990:68) proposes that cat concealments were associated with rites of commencement intended "to bind a spirit to the new building for apotro- paic and prophylactic purposes." Throughout much of the world there exists a long tradition of foundation sacrifice, consecra- tion rituals, and other rites of commencement (Burdick 1901; Hartland 1937:109-115; Ó Súil- leabháin 1945; Jarvis 2003). In fact, various manifestations of these rituals, such as topping out, time capsules, and cornerstone deposits, are still being practiced in the United States today. The repeated presence of the isolated bodies of cats in the foundation or subfloor spaces of buildings lends support to the theory that cat concealments are part of an unsanctioned con- secration ritual undertaken by members of the building trades, particularly those involved in the masonry and plastering trades, and not the homeowners themselves. Whatever the original purpose of the ritual, by the early modern period the immuring of cats in buildings had most likely evolved into a general good-luck charm. Despite their association with diabolical witchcraft and feminine trickery, cats, particularly black cats, are largely perceived as omens of good luck in Great Britain (Briggs 1980:66; Simpson and Roud 2000:49; Roud 2003:66-68). They are frequently depicted on early-20th-century British greeting cards in association with other good-luck symbols, such as horseshoes and old shoes (Figure 3). This association with good luck and fortune may have influenced the use of cats in some ritual concealments. As with witch bottles and concealed foot- wear, a typology has been developed in order to highlight the variations in context of cat concealments and to help identify and interpret future discoveries. Type A deposits consist of cats accompanied by dried rats, mice, or birds. In such cases the use of natural magic, in which a cat serves as a charm against infestation, is a likely interpretation. As a quasi-magical ritual, the ability of such a display to actually deter unwanted vermin is irrelevant. There are four known examples of Type A deposits in the United States. Type B deposits consist of cats found alone in subfloor spaces or foundation cavities, sometimes specially built for the purpose of concealment, and often under thresholds and hearths. These cases can be described as true "foundation deposits" made during the original construction episode, almost certainly represent- ing a consecration ritual undertaken by members of the building trades without the knowledge or consent of the buildings' occupants. Originally they may have served as an offering to the structure, perhaps to imbue the building with a protective spirit. Examples of Type B deposits include the cat found in a foundation cavity at the Carlyle House in Alexandria, Virginia, and a specimen recovered from a threshold cavity in a house in Berkeley, California (Manning 2012). Type C deposits consist of cats placed within buildings, in locations other than Type B, such</page><page sequence="18">M. CHRIS MANNING - The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 69 as in a wall or roof. These deposits may be the result of a general belief that a cat immured in a building conveys good luck to the structure and its occupants. The skeletal remains discovered in the Ohio Statehouse can be classified as a Type C deposit. Type D deposits include the remains of cats that are accompanied by additional ritual objects, such as shoes or garments, or that are a part of a larger mixed assemblage, such as a spiritual midden. Research on cat concealments has been seri- ously overlooked by scholars, particularly in North America. What little data is available, however, shows some promising avenues for future investigation. A thorough inspection of the bodies of concealed cats may determine cause of death, such as two cases in Austria in which the animals were found with their necks broken, or reveal other forms of trauma, such as the five cases in Germany in which the front left paw was severed (Schad 2005). Ian Evans (2010:164) has recommended using x-ray analysis and forensic methods to identify possible artificial causes of death. Pennick (1986:15) has also proposed that analysis be conducted on all specimens to determine the variety, age, and sex of each animal, which may have been a factor in the preferential selection of particular animals for concealment. As with all ritual concealments, more thorough documentation and analysis of cat deposits in both the United States and abroad is needed to understand fully the motivations for concealment, and the cultural origins, symbolism, and development of this unusual folk ritual. Other Ritual Concealments Thus far the archaeological and ethnohistorical evidence for three very different types of ritual concealments has been presented; however, witch bottles, footwear, and cats are only a few of the many artifacts that have been found in concealed deposits. This section provides an overview of some additional artifacts found in concealments in the United States and compares them to similar examples found in the British Isles and northern Europe. While in-depth analysis of each artifact type is beyond the scope of this article, it is anticipated that the following synopsis will give the reader some idea of the broad range of artifacts found in concealments, as well as offer additional evidence for the material manifestation of European magic and folk ritual in colonial and postcolonial America. Garments and Textiles Garments and textile fragments often accom- pany concealed shoes, occurring in 17% of multicomponent deposits worldwide (Pitt 1998). Isolated finds of garments and textiles, while common, are far less likely to be reported. Research conducted by the author identified a total of 28 deposits containing garments or tex- tile fragments in the United States, the majority of which were accompanied by shoes or other artifacts (Manning 2012). Similar to deposits in Europe, the most common types of garments found in American concealments are hats and other headwear (n=6), socks and stockings (n=5), gloves and mittens (n=4), and corsets and stays (n=3), with other articles of clothing occurring with less fre- quency. Examples of concealed headwear include a campaign hat found with an army boot in a barracks at Fort Rosecrans, California (May 2001); a man's hat and pair of Wellington boots discovered under a roof in James City County, Virginia (Geisler 2003); and a leather hat found with a military boot, a woman's shoe sole, and other artifacts under a house in Virginia City, Nevada (Schablitsky 2002). A large deposit of 29 shoes found behind a wall in a house in Balti- more's Fell's Point neighborhood contained two stockings - one adult's and one child's (Manning 2012). At the late- 17th-century Hancock-Clarke House in Lexington, Massachusetts, a set of tod- dler's stays was recovered from a wall. Another notable deposit consisted of a boy's brown linen jacket dating to 1775-1785, concealed in the wall of a house in Guilford, Connecticut. Like footwear, almost all garments found in concealed deposits are heavily worn, with creases, holes, and evidence of repair or altera- tion (Eastop 2007). Eastop (2010:151) has sug- gested that worn garments were preferentially selected for concealment "because a worn gar- ment retains the form of its wearer's body." According to Hyatt (1973:2677): "[C]lothing is a substitute for the human body only if it contains sweat - it must be dirty." This close association with sweat may have influenced the preferential selection of certain garment types for concealment, namely socks, hats, and</page><page sequence="19">70 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) undergarments. Some garments also appear to have been purposefully mutilated before con- cealment (Bennett 2006; Eastop 2006:241). The soiled and heavily worn condition of concealed garments can make them difficult to recognize in situ, since they "can be easily mistaken for rags, particularly when mixed with building debris" (Eastop 2010:150). Dolls and Poppets In Great Britain and Europe, figurines or dolls, called "poppets," were frequently used in image magic into the early 20th century (Kittredge 1956:91). These poppets could be constructed of clay, wax, wood, or cloth, and were pinched, twisted, stroked, burnt, or pricked with pins in the belief that what was done to the poppet would also be suffered by the intended victim (Kittredge 1956:73-91; Demos 2008:98). Dolls and poppets are occasionally found concealed in structures in the British Isles, and in some cases the ritual nature of the object is quite clear. For example, a late- 19th-century poppet found in a crevice in the brickwork of a house in Hereford, England, was accompanied by a written curse tucked into the doll's skirt: Mary Ann Ward. I act this spell on you from my holl heart wishing you to never sleep the rester part of your life. I hope your flesh will waste away and I hope you will never spend another penny I ought to have. Wishing this from my whole heart. (Simpson and Roud 2000:193) Poppets were also used in magic and ritual in North America during the colonial period. In 1688, Goodwife Glover, an Irish Catholic living in Boston, Massachusetts, was accused of witch- craft. The authorities ordered her house searched, "from whence there were brought into the court, several small Images, or Puppets, or Babies, made of Raggs, and stuff't with Goat's hair, and other such Ingredients" (Godbeer 1992:38-39). Similar objects were described during the Salem trials, when numerous accounts of the use of poppets emerged. When John and William Blye assisted their neighbor, Bridget Bishop, in knocking down an old wall in her cellar, they discovered "in holes of the s'd owld wall Belonging to the s'd sellar ... Severall popitts made up of Raggs And hogs Brusells w'th headles pins in Them, w'th the points out ward" (St. George 1998:188). At least two examples of poppets have been uncovered in concealed contexts in the United States. At Cutchogue, Long Island, a collection of artifacts discovered in the walls of the mid- 17th- century Benjamin Horton House included "three old home-made dolls made of twigs bound together and wrapped with hand- woven linen ... one with a corncob head" (F. Brown 1940:19- 20). St. George (1998:188) argues that these dolls represent magical poppets similar to the ones described in colonial accounts. Another example of concealed anthropomorphic images comes from Damascus, Virginia, where a set of six crude dolls was concealed in the wall of the Coverston House. The figures are made of muslin rags stuffed with straw and appear to represent a family (Manning 2012). Neither of the two deposits of doll-like effi- gies found in concealments in the United States show evidence of pins or written charms; there- fore, they may simply be primitive dolls, the lost playthings of a child. However, both sets of figures were found inside the walls of build- ings, which has already been shown to be an important location for ritual objects. The fact that the featureless figures are clothed in rags is also significant because poppets were often dressed in scraps of fabric obtained from the clothing of the intended victim. Alternatively, some poppets concealed in buildings may have served a less sinister role, perhaps representing a symbolic offering to the building or the contribution of a child to a household's spiritual midden. Horse Skulls One of the more unusual types of artifacts found concealed in buildings in the United States are the skulls of horses, which are also frequently found in Ireland, Wales, England, and parts of Scandinavia (Grove 1901; Trev- elyan 1909; Leather 1913; Ó Súilleabháin 1945; Sandklef 1949; Buchanan 1956; K. Harris 1957, 1958; M. Brown 1966; G. Evans 1966; Lloyd 1969; Pennick 1986; Merrifield 1987; Hayhurst 1989; Hooper 1989; Hoggard 2004). Like cats, they are rarely accompanied by other artifacts, although it is not uncommon for a deposit to contain more than one horse skull or additional parts of the animal, such as the jaw or long bones. Horse skulls are most often found under the floor or in the foundation, sometimes in</page><page sequence="20">M. CHRIS MANNING - The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 71 close proximity to a threshold or hearth, and less frequently in walls or chimney cavities. Like other types of ritual concealments, there is some debate as to why horse skulls were hidden in buildings; generally there are two schools of thought. The first argues that horse skulls were placed under the floor to enhance the acoustics of the room, especially in spaces used for threshing, dancing, singing, or the playing of music (Grove 1901:348; Sandklef 1949; Simpson and Roud 2000:188). The second theory maintains that horse skulls and other bones served a ritual function, perhaps apotro- paic in nature or intended to bring good luck to the structure (Buchanan 1956). There is some evidence to support each theory, including oral testimony from informants in both the British Isles and Scandinavia (Ó Súilleabháin 1945; Sandklef 1949; K. Harris 1957, 1958). While many informants assert that horse skulls in buildings served a purely acoustic function, there are some particularly compelling accounts that support a ritual function. In Wales it was reported that horse skulls were kept in houses "to dispel the spirits," placed under the floor "to prevent or counteract witchcraft," and nailed above barn doors "to keep witches away" (Trevelyan 1909:78; Leather 1913:110; Lloyd 1969:134). Similarly, Finnish folklore indicates that a fear of witchcraft was the primary pur- pose for the deposit of horse skulls in buildings (Hukantaival 2009). In County Armagh, Ireland, in 1838, horse skulls were considered "sonsie," bringing prosperity and good fortune, and for this reason were buried in barn floors and under the thresholds of houses (E. Evans 1957:215). In County Down, a horse skull under the barn floor ensured that "the barn would always be full" (K. Harris 1957:70), while in County Antrim horse skulls were buried in barns "for luck or good yield in the corn" (K. Harris 1958:77), suggesting a connection between the concealment of horse skulls in agricultural buildings and fertility. The most detailed account of the ritual con- cealment of a horse skull comes from Norfolk, England, where an informant and his brother witnessed a horse skull being laid in the foun- dation of a Methodist chapel in 1897: [T]hey watched the workmen dig the trench for the foundations and then saw their uncle carefully mark the centre of the site by driving into the ground a wooden stake. The men gathered round while the uncle uncorked a bottle of beer, then the horse's head was placed in the bottom of the trench, the first glass of liquor from the bottle was thrown on it, and, when the rest of the beer had been drunk, the men shoveled bricks and mortar on top of the head. It was explained ... that this was an old heathen custom to drive evil and witchcraft away. (E. Porter 1969:181) Several scholars (Ó Súilleabháin 1945; G. Evans 1966; Lloyd 1969; Hooper 1989) have proposed that the ritual function of horse skulls was the original application, with the prac- tice later rationalized as a method of acoustic enhancement. Another possibility is that the apotropaic function and the acoustic function are one and the same (Merrifield 1987; Moore- Colyer 1993; Hukantaival 2009). Loud noises, particularly the clanging of church bells and the banging of metal objects, were believed to scare away fairies and demons (Thomas 1971:31; Hukantaival 2009:354-355). E. Evans (1957:216) suggests that the rhythmic sound made by Irish threshing flails may have been intended to repel evil spirits from the harvested crop. Although hundreds of horse skulls have been found in buildings in the British Isles and Scan- dinavia, their presence in ritual concealments in the United States has not been documented until recently. At the 18th-century Bryant Home- stead in South Deerfield, Massachusetts, the homeowner discovered a horse skull concealed within the cavity of an interior wall next to a closed-off fireplace (Elliott 1991:49-50). Wedged inside an eye socket was a piece of paper bear- ing the names of Colonel David Mason Bryant and his family, who moved into the house in 1848 (Rocky Foley 2011, elee. comm.). The skull was likely added to the wall during a period of structural alteration as part of a com- memorative ritual similar to a time capsule or cornerstone deposit. On the other hand, the fact that the Bryant family, who were of English ancestry, chose to include a horse skull within the walls of their home indicates the tradition of concealing horse skulls was still alive and well in 19th-century America. A second case of concealed horse skulls has been reported in Cahokia, Illinois, where four skulls were found during restoration of the Nicho- las Jarrot Mansion (Manning 2012). The two-story Federal-style house, built for French-born entrepre- neur Nicholas Jarrot between 1807 and 1810, is</page><page sequence="21">72 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) the oldest brick building in the state (Figure 5). The skulls were recovered from three different locations in the building: one was found behind a wall next to a first-story fireplace; a second skull was found on top of a load-bearing interior brick wall, directly above a doorway; and two additional skulls were found approximately 15 ft. away, rest- ing on top of the same load-bearing wall. The discovery of concealed horse skulls in the United States is a significant development in the study of ritual concealments, in part because it is difficult to come up with mundane explana- tions for their presence. After all, while it may be possible to explain away the presence of bottles, shoes, and garments in the structural voids of buildings, as Hukantaival (2009:350) wryly observes: "[I]t is obviously not so easy to acci- dentally lose a horse in your house." Horseshoes and Other Iron Implements In Europe there is ample evidence of the ritual use of iron from the Iron Age through the 20th century (Merrifield 1987). The most common form of iron apotropaia in the British Isles was the horseshoe, the ability of which to repel and protect resulted in its use primarily at openings in the home: hung above the doorway, imbedded in the threshold, or mounted over the fireplace (Thomas 1971; Manning 2012). In 19th-century Sussex, it was thought that a horseshoe nailed over the door "will prevent all witches and evil spirits crossing the threshold" (Latham 1878:24). In addition to horseshoes, sharp iron objects, such as knives, shears and scissors, hoe blades, axe heads, nails and spikes, and fireplace pokers were all used for ritual protection (Merrifield 1987:162). In Wales, scythe blades were placed in the chimney "edge upwards" to prevent fairies from entering (Evans- Wentz 1911:144). Knives were placed under the doormat to ward off witches in 20th-century Cambridgeshire, England, as it was believed they could not pass over iron (Merrifield 1987:162; Hooper 1988). Iron objects could also be imbedded or enclosed within the walls of a house to ensure permanent protection against malignant forces, such as the FIGURE 5. The Nicholas Jarrot Mansion as it appeared in 1 934. (Photo by Joseph Golabowski, Historic American Buildings Survey, HABS ILL, 82-CAHO, 2-1.)</page><page sequence="22">M. CHRIS MANNING - The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 73 two iron knives built into the wall of a 1 6th- or early- 17th-century house in Kent, England (Merrifield 1969:103, 1987:162). Similar con- cealments have been reported in Essex, England, where builders discovered an 18th-century iron- bladed knife imbedded in plaster covering the chimney breast of a 15th-century house (Hooper 1988). Similar traditions of the deliberate con- cealment of iron implements have been reported elsewhere in Europe. In northern Finland, an iron axe head, identified by archaeologists as a "special deposit," was found under the floor of a ca. 1700 structure (Herva and Ylimaunu 2009:237). According to Herva and Ylimaunu (2009), the use of iron implements, such as axe heads, for the ritual protection of livestock is well documented in regional folklore. In the United States, iron artifacts were also used for ritual protection. In fact, the first writ- ten description of horseshoes in colonial Virginia in 1671 refers to their use in folk magic: In April of that year Edward Cole of Northumberland County accused Hanna, wife of Captain Christopher Neale, of putting a curse on his family and cattle, but later withdrew his accusation upon noting Mrs. Neale' s benevolent actions after she passed near a horseshoe nailed at the door of his home. (Chappell 1973:100) Although the ritual use of horseshoes is repeatedly described in American folklore, horseshoes are infrequently interpreted as ritual artifacts by historical archaeologists; see Wilkie (1995), St. George (1998), and Baker (2009) for exceptions. When found in concealed contexts, iron arti- facts almost certainly served a ritual function. A deposit found directly under a window inside the wall of a house in Crisfield, Maryland, included two horseshoes, a broken saltshaker, a spent bullet, and a large knife, all placed inside an old sock (Manning 2012). The combination of artifacts in this assemblage, most notably the horseshoe and knife, and their placement within the structural fabric of the building indicate that this is a ritual concealment. Another notable example of iron objects in a ritual concealment comes from Danvers, Massachusetts, where a small iron eel-spear trident and an iron horse- shoe were found affixed to structural timbers of the Zerubabbel Endicott House (St. George 1998:191-192). The location of both items under the original weatherboard siding near the front door and the chimney is highly indicative of apotropaic magic. Printed Texts and Written Charms Bibles, prayer books, and other religious texts associated with divine protection, as well as almanacs, which are associated with astrology and the occult sciences, have been found in concealed deposits and spiritual middens in the British Isles, continental Europe, and the United States (Darwood and Sherriff 2003; Bennett 2006; Viegas 2007). In some cases these arti- facts appear to have been deliberately torn apart before concealment. Swedish folklore includes numerous accounts of the use of the pages of almanacs, hymnbooks, and Bibles as protection from nightmares (Sandklef 1949:64), suggesting that such materials may have served a similar apotropaic function in American concealments. Mundane printed materials and documents, such as newspapers, journals, and letters, have also been found in concealed contexts and may have been used in similar ways (Atzbach 2006; Ben- nett 2006:9). Other forms of the written word with a more explicit magical function have also been found. Spoken spells and written charms accompa- nied many early magico-religious amulets, folk remedies, and countercharms (J. Porter 1894; Morgan 1895a, 1895b; Forbes 1971; Davies 1996; Donmoyer, this issue). These charms, which Merrifield (1987:152) describes as "a mixture of prayer and spell, of piety and ritual enchantment," often contain Latin words or phrases; Bible verses; religious names, titles, words, or symbols; astrological symbols; and patterns of numbers, letters, or words, including number squares, word squares, word triangles, and palindromes. In addition to references to Christian motifs, written charms often incorporate a variety of magical words and symbols, the best known being the abracadabra word triangle and the sator square. The abracadabra triangle employs a well-known magical word with pre-Christian origins, although its exact meaning is unclear (Ohrt 1922). The sator square is a palindrome in which the same five words ( sator areto tenet otera rotas) appear when read from any direction. Like the abracadabra triangle, the sator square has its origins in the pre-Christian period (Meyer</page><page sequence="23">74 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) and Smith 1999). In addition to appearing in written charms, the sator square has been found inscribed on a section of wall plaster excavated from the 2nd-century A.D. Romano-British town of Corinium in Gloucestershire, England (Mer- rifield 1987:figure 45). Early examples have also been found in Germany, Portugal, and Italy (Merrifield 1987:142-143). In the 19th and 20th centuries, the charm was written on paper and worn around the neck to protect from disease and misfortune, and kept around the house to protect from fire, fits, and miscarriage (J. Porter 1894:113; Forbes 1971:298). It is often found in a corrupted form in which the order of the words or letters is inverted or written out as a sentence (Merrifield 1987:144-145). There is historical evidence for the use of writ- ten and spoken spells and charms in the United States in the colonial period. Cotton Mather admonished those who "cure Hurts with Spells" (Godbeer 1992:61). Colonial clergyman Samuel Williard "lamented that the Devil had 'taught men to use the name of God, or of Christ, or of some notable Sentence that is recorded in God's Word, (which is also his name) either for the keeping of Devils out of places, or for the Curing of these or those Maladies that men labour of'" (Godbeer 1992:25). Although spoken and written charms were commonly used in Europe and North America, material evidence is less common, since it gen- erally does not show up in the archaeological record. Nevertheless, examples of written spells have been reported in the United States (Don- moyer, this issue). While conducting ethnographic fieldwork in a German Appalachian community in Pendleton County, West Virginia, Milnes (2007) discovered a piece of paper with the sator square glued above every window of a house. In the barn he found several more examples of written charms, including another sator square, a triangular abracadabra charm tacked over a cattle manger, and a number square in which "[a]ny way the numbers are added, horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, their sum is eighteen" (Milnes 2007:177,180). Another documented case of a written charm concealed in a structure was reported from Curtice, Ohio, where workers found a written charm attached to a doorpost under the wood siding of a ca. 1890 timber- frame barn (Saeger 1994). The note was written in German and included a series of names and abbreviations identified as "an amulet in the form of names together with a rudimentary incanta- tional prayer, begging for protection for the house and its inhabitants" (Saeger 1994). Donmoyer (this issue) has also documented written charms from concealed contexts in Pennsylvania barns. Archaeologists and architectural historians should keep an eye out for similar examples in build- ings throughout the United States, particularly in structures associated with the German diaspora. Discussion: Private Domestic Ritual and the Protection of the Family and Home The focus of this article has been on ritual concealments in domestic spaces associated with European and European American populations. While some concealments may be the result of maleficium , builders' rites, charms to ward off vermin, or attempts to safeguard the fertility of livestock and crops, others are more closely tied to the protection and wellbeing of the family and the home. Analysis of American shoe conceal- ments suggests that the cultural heritage of New England and the greater Northeast influenced the distribution of deposits. Moreover, the relative lack of deposits in the lower Chesapeake and the Tidewater indicates that the European populations that settled those regions did not bring with them a strong tradition of shoe concealment or other domestic ritual concealment. It is proposed here that two primary factors influenced by varia- tions in the cultural origins of English-speaking colonists affected the distribution of concealed footwear, garments, and spiritual middens in the United States: a propensity for a household composition and family structure that emphasized the nuclear family unit, and a cosmology and worldview in which domestic spirits, demons, and familiars played an active role. Household and Family Structure Some scholars have observed the repeated presence of artifacts associated with children in concealed deposits, including children's shoes, garments, and toys. These artifacts are often interpreted as prophylactics against child mortality, symbols of fertility and fecundity, or evidence of a belief that "goodness would prevail over evil" (Eastop 2001:80; I. Evans 2010:136,174,181-182). It is suggested here,</page><page sequence="24">M. CHRIS MANNING- The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 75 however, that artifacts associated with children were not preferentially selected for concealment; instead, the presence of children and a strong nuclear-family unit in a household were more likely to influence the need for certain types of ritual concealments. This theory is supported by a brief analysis of regional variation in house- hold composition in the eastern United States. According to Fischer (1989:68-77), Puritan households in colonial Massachusetts were characterized by a strong focus on the nuclear family, a high proportion of intact marriages based on reciprocal affection, and a relatively greater number of children per household, characteristics that were similarly apparent in the East Anglia region of England during that same period. There were also fewer servants and slaves in Massachusetts than elsewhere in colonial America - less than one servant per family - and many households had no servants at all, which is notably different from colonies in the lower Chesapeake (Fischer 1989:71-72). This intense focus on the nuclear family also resulted in an increased suspicion and distrust of outsiders, even members of one's own com- munity, particularly if they did not conform to the established mores regarding household and family structure. In the Virginia colony, household composi- tion was notably different from that of Mas- sachusetts. There was a similar importance of family, but that importance was focused on the extended family more than on the nuclear- family unit (Fischer 1989:274-279). Households still contained a nuclear unit at their cores, but those units included fewer children and were augmented by live-in step-relatives, half-brothers and -sisters, aunts and uncles, cousins, orphans and wards, tutors, lodgers, and servants and slaves on a scale that did not exist in New Eng- land (Fischer 1989:276-278). In the lower Ches- apeake and Tidewater, as well as in the Deep South, 18th- and 19th-century households - particularly the households of the wealthy and upper-middle class - were more likely to exhibit porous boundaries in which the white plantation family, domestic slaves, field hands, white and black overseers, and slaves who were biologi- cally related to the white family, could all be found. This may explain in part why ritual concealments in domestic structures are less common in these regions, where the typical household composition was notably different from that of the Northeast. Thus, it should be expected that evidence of domestic ritual would be more readily found in New England and the surround- ing region, particularly if those rituals involved the strengthening of nuclear family bonds and/or protection from outside forces that threatened the nuclear-family unit. Cosmology and Worldview In addition to differences in household struc- ture, the residents of colonial New England brought with them an intense belief in and fear of supernatural beings that was more pro- nounced than in the Southern colonies. Although the British Isles saw relatively few mass witch trials and executions compared to Central Europe, Puritan East Anglia experienced some of the most intense witch panics in England. Coincidentally, it is also the region in which the greatest concentration of shoe concealments is found. Similarly, Puritan New England also experienced a brief but intense period of witch persecution, compared to the Anglican colonies to the south, and also exhibits the heaviest con- centration of concealed footwear in the United States. Additionally, the concept of the witch's familiar, which is closely tied to a belief in both demonic beings and helpful domestic spir- its, was almost exclusively limited to England, Scotland, and the northeastern United States (Wilby 2000). This evidence suggests that the concealment of shoes and garments, while not isolated to either East Anglia or the New Eng- land colonies, was more heavily concentrated in these areas because it is where belief in the apotropaic power of shoes and clothing, and a worldview that readily acknowledged the power of witchcraft, familiars, and domestic spirits intersected with a strong desire to safeguard the nuclear family. The Puritans who journeyed to North America and settled in Massachusetts and the surrounding region were deeply alarmed by the evil forces they perceived to be assailing them from all sides. Cotton Mather (1693) offers a plethora of evidence that legions of demons and witches plagued the colony, intent on destroying their godly society, blaming the Devil's evil forces for calamities as diverse as crop failure, storms, earthquakes, fires, disasters at sea, unexplained</page><page sequence="25">76 HISTORICAL ARCHAEOLOGY 48(3) deaths, "internal maladies" and "wasting sick- nesses," and the violent attacks and "sorcer- ies" of the local native populations. Mather observed that in Massachusetts, "the Devils are so many, that some Thousands, can sometimes at once apply themselves to vex one Child of Man," lamenting that "there never was a poor Plantation, more pursued by the Wrath of the Devil, than our poor New-England" (C. Mather 1693:38,62). The Massachusetts colonists must have been dismayed by the undue hardships they experienced in their new home, which likely had some questioning whether they were in fact God's "Chosen Ones." Mather reassured his flock that these hardships were God's way of testing the moral fortitude and resolve of his covenanted community. Although he discouraged the colonists from resorting to apotropaic magic or, as he termed it, "little witchcrafts," Mather's recommended weapons of prayer and fasting must have left some colonists feeling vulnerable and defenseless (C. Mather 1693:35). Despite the warnings, it is likely that they turned to tried-and-true methods for placating spirits - an old shoe or garment, a bowl of milk or crust of bread left on the hearth, even, perhaps, the body of a chicken - to invite a benevolent and protective spirit to take up residence in the house to guard the family and fend off the legions of demons or, conversely, to repel or "lay" harm- ful beings that attempted to enter their houses through the chimney or other small aperture (Easton, this issue). Indeed, numerous descriptions of suspected witches who propitiated familiars and other dia- bolical beings - which they themselves may have perceived simply as helpful domestic spirits - can be found in the writings of the 17th-century Puritans. Cotton Mather (1693:40) declared that demons "differ not from those baser Goblins that chuse to Nest in the filthy and loathsom Rags of a beastly Sorceress." Furthermore, Mather warned: "If it can be proved, that the party suspected hath entertained a Familiar Spirit, and had Conference with it, in the likeness of some visible Creatures; here is Evidence of witchcraft" (C. Mather 1693:29). One passage explained how colonists, who used magic to attract seemingly benevolent spirits to assist around the house and farm, were in fact consorting with demons: There are others, that have used most wicked Sorcer- ies to gratifie their unlawful Curiosities, or to prevent Inconveniences in Man and Beast; Sorceries, which I will not Name, lest I should by Naming, Teach them. Now, some Devil is evermore invited into the Service of the Person that shall Practice these Witchcrafts; and if they have gone on Impenitently in these Communions with any Devil, the Devil may perhaps become at last a Familiar to them, and so assume their Livery, that they cannot shake him off in any way, but that One, which I would most heartily prescribe unto them, Namely, That of a deep and long Repentance. (C. Mather 1693:19-20) Analysis and Interpretation Given Cotton Mather's accounts of a commu- nity plagued by the machinations of Satan, it is highly likely that New England Puritans would have sought magical protection in various forms. Fortunately, the methods were already known: old shoes and worn clothing concealed around the chimney and within the walls; bottles to trap or repel witches and spirits; offerings of milk, bread, and small animals, such as chickens, deposited in the walls and near the hearth; written charms and magical symbols; objects of iron, especially horseshoes, knives, and other edge tools, nailed to the door or hidden around the house; and the use of other small tokens and charms with apotropaic properties. Alternatively, the presence of concealed deposits near the hearth may be related to private domestic rituals intended to strengthen familial cohesion and promote the general wellbeing of the household. Pitt (1998:6) has noted the highly personal nature of the incredible variety of mundane objects found in concealments, all closely tied to the members of the family, their habits, and their daily work, a concept that Easton (this issue) explores in detail. It is possible that these highly personal artifacts represent spiritual devotions intended to consecrate the home for the family's use or to transfer the family's "spirit" and good fortune to a new house, just as the protective familial house spirits were once similarly transferred (Manning 2012). This would explain why some deposits were added to over the course of several generations, as Easton suggests, periodically "recharged," perhaps each winter season or upon the transfer of the house from one owner to the next. Perhaps each new inhabitant, each member added to the family through marriage or birth, deposited something</page><page sequence="26">M. CHRIS MANNING - The Material Culture of Ritual Concealments in the United States 77 personal into the house body as an offering to the "spirit" of the place. Herva and Ylimaunu (2009:239) argue that the European house spirit was not a concrete figure that existed separately from the building. Instead, they suggest that objects concealed in buildings were intended to bring good luck to the household and protect it from evil by imbu- ing the building itself with the special properties of those objects. In this view, the deposition of objects animates the building with a spirit so that it was "perceived and regarded as [a] living person-like being" (Herva and Ylimaunu 2009:240). This interpretation corresponds with St. George's (1998) analysis of the metaphorical house body and the hearth as the heart or soul of the home. It may also provide an alternate expla- nation for the wide variety of artifacts that have been found in concealed deposits and spiritual middens. The objects selected for concealment would likely be those that exhibit signs of wear and long-term use, perhaps curated objects inher- ited from family members, or those which retain the imprint, scent, or mark of the owner (Herva and Ylimaunu 2009:240). Such objects could be simultaneously viewed as gifts to house spirits and as gifts of spirit. It is unclear whether such objects were con- cealed with the idea of repelling evil spirits or of attracting protective ones. Perhaps even those who participated in the rituals were unsure. Were the shoes and clothes meant to attract a friendly spirit or repel a malevolent demon? What about the bits of broken ceramics and glass, fragments of furniture and toys, faunai and botanical materials, books and documents, broken pipe stems, and hundreds of other seemingly mundane artifacts? Do they represent attempts at warding off evil and misfortune, or offerings to benevolent beings? Maybe these highly personal artifacts represent spiritual devotions intended to consecrate the home for the family's use. It is likely that all of these ideas informed the ritual concealment of objects in buildings. Conclusion The preceding discussion has presented evi- dence for a continued tradition of ritual conceal- ments in and around domestic structures in the United States, demonstrating both the variety of artifacts found in concealments and some of the ways in which historical archaeology and folklore can work together to identify and interpret depos- its. Ritual concealments in standing structures offer an excellent opportunity to study the mate- rial evidence of European folk belief. Analysis of the available data indicates that British and other European immigrants to North America brought with them a complex and vibrant tradition of folk magic that continued well into the 20th cen- tury. This observation is strengthened by recent research in Australia, where similar deposits of shoes, garments, cats, and other artifacts have been found concealed in buildings dating from the late 18th century through the 1930s (I. Evans 2010). When compared with analogous deposits in Europe and the British Isles, ritual conceal- ments in the United States effectively illustrate how belief systems and worldview both change and remain remarkably the same over time, and how those beliefs manifest in the archaeological record. This paper has also touched upon the ways in which cultural stereotypes and Eurocentric interpretations have affected how historical archaeologists currently study and interpret mate- rial evidence of magic and ritual in the United States. Ideally, this discussion has drawn atten- tion to the need for an archaeology of magic and ritual that moves beyond race to explore other relevant factors, such as cosmology and worldview, household and family structure, and culturally prescribed ideas regarding the physi- cal and spiritual boundaries of domestic spaces. May (2001:6) argues: "Archaeologists should rethink every bottle, bone, coin, jar, hat and boot concealed inside and under historic buildings." Concurring with May, the author proposes that, instead of viewing evidence of folk magic and ritual as an archaeological anomaly, historical archaeologists begin to approach every historical site and structure - and not just those associated with the African diaspora - with the expectation of uncovering material evidence of magico- religious and secular folk ritual.
