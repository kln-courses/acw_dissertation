Sir J. H. Jeans has been reappointed member of the Advisory Council for a further period of one year.</page><page sequence="3">49? SCIENCE PROGRESS The centenaries of the deaths of Thomas Young and Sir Humphry Davy both occur in May this year. It has been arranged to hold the first meeting of the British Association in South Africa on July 22 in Capetown, when the President, Sir Thomas Holland, will take over the duties of his office. The members of the Association will call at Kimberley on July 29 and the Presidential Address will be delivered at Johannesburg on July 31. Further sectional meetings will be held at Pretoria and after August 7 the members will disperse for tours through the Union. L'Association française pour l'Avancement des Sciences has invited those members of the British Association who are unable to travel to South Africa to attend its meeting at Le Havre. Owing to the continued illness of Dr. E. H. Griffiths, the general treasurer of the Associa- tion, the Council has decided, with great regret, to accept his resignation and has appointed Sir Josiah Stamp to be his successor. The Nineteenth Annual Exhibition arranged by the Physical and Optical Societies will be held at the Imperial College of Science and Technology on January 8, 9, and 10. The total disbursements of the Rockefeller Foundation during the year 1927 just exceeded eleven million dollars, of which two million dollars were given to the University of London on account of the purchase of the Bloomsbury site. The Regent House of the University of Cambridge has definitely accepted the offer of the International Education Board to contribute ¿700,000 towards the cost of the new University Library and to the faculties of Biology and Physics. The payments made by the Board will be in proportion to the amounts raised by other means, the full University quota being £229,000. The Council of the Institute of Marine Engineers (85/88, The Minories, London, E.i) offers the Herbert Akroyd Stuart Award, value about £56, for the best paper on The Origin and Development of Heavy Oil Engines delivered to them by April 30, 1929. The competition is open to all, and the marks will be awarded as to 30 per cent, for historical interest, 50 per cent, for technical interest, and 20 per cent, for literary merit. The International Education Board of New York is providing the funds for a 200-inch reflecting telescope to be erected in California, possibly at Mount Wilson. Dr. J. A. Anderson, of the Mount Wilson Observatory, will be in charge of the work of manufacture and erection, and Dr. Elihu Thomson, of the General Electric Co., will undertake the production of the mirror. Fused quartz is to be tried first, and, in the event of failure with that substance, pyrex glass next. The telescope will be under the control of the Astrophysical Observatory of</page><page sequence="4">NOTES 499 the California Institute, which will co-operate with the staff at Mount Wilson. The new Safety in Mines Research Laboratories in Sheffield, opened officially by the Prime Minister on October 1 1 last, are described in detail in Safety in Mines Research Board Paper No. 44 (H.M. Stationery Office, price 6d. net). The opening of this new research station is the last step in the efforts which have been made for more than a century to apply the systematic methods of science to the solution of problems of the dangers of coal mining. The laboratories are intended for small-scale experimental work, the large-scale experiments being carried out at the Buxton station, opened eighteen months ago. The staffs of the two stations work as one unit, investigators being transferred from one to the other as the nature and progress of their work require. Both are paid for by grants voted by the Miners' Welfare Committee from their fund. The new building has four floors and a basement. The rooms are small, but separated by light movable partitions, so that larger rooms to house several workers can be formed if future requirements make it necessary. Steam is supplied at 50 lb. per sq. inch from a boiler on the second floor and " vacuum " from a pump in the basement capable of exhausting 40 cubic feet per minute to a vacuum of nearly 30 inches of mercury. Alternating current is supplied from the town mains and direct current from a 40-kilowatt converter, the wiring being carried out in cab- tyre sheathed cable run bare on the walls to enable modifications to be made with a minimum of disturbance. There is a small library of books and periodicals. The paper contains brief accounts of the investigations now in progress in the laboratories and eleven full-page plates illus- trating rooms and experimental arrangements. We recommend to the attention of our readers a lecture entitled Anthropomorphism and Physics delivered by Prof. T. P. Nunn to the British Academy in 1926 (London : Hum- phrey Milford, price 2 s. net). It contains a philosophical review of the present position of physics and an expression of the somewhat heterodox opinions of its distinguished author, who believes that " music and laughter, the coloured beauty of living creatures and of the sky, sea, mountain, and plain, even in some way the goodly savour of food, wine, and tobacco, are realities - not phantasms dwelling only in the mind " - a belief which he maintains is shared by even " the hardest-shelled man of science " after business hours ! Prof. Nunn maintains the doctrine of the objectivity of sensa. " ' It is not in virtue of a substance contained in them that things are ; they are, when they are qualified to produce an appearance of there being a substance in them ' " (Lotze). The latter part of the address</page><page sequence="5">goo SCIENCE PROGRESS contains arguments against the existence of the electron. One - the metaphysical argument - is summed up thus : " For if the only shapes, sizes, and positions we know are those of sensa, how can an electron, into whose constitution, by hypo- thesis, no sensa enter, have position, size, or shape ? " The other " aims at discrediting all scientific objects by showing that in the history of science they have been constantly found out and discarded," e.g. caloric, electric fluids in current-bearing wires, and the sether. It is not impossible, even, indeed, probable that Prof. Nunn may be right about the electron ; but the arguments employed can carry but little conviction to the experimentalist. In conclusion, there is a brief discussion of the wave-group theory of the electron. The question is asked " Waves of what? " and answered in terms of White- head's " ether of events." Whether one agrees with Prof. Nunn or not one must agree that his lecture is interesting, provocative, and worthy to be read. The Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada (Vol. XXII, section iii), for January 1928, contains a number of papers of considerable interest to physicists. Prof. Boyle and Dr. Rawlinson contribute a paper showing details of a solution of the problem of the passage of sound through three contiguous homogeneous media with plane parallel interfaces. The special case of the transmission through a partition in an infinite medium is of importance in ultra-sonic wave research. One conclusion is that all the incident energy will be transmitted by the partition if cos t'/cos r = pivjpjvi, where p and v indicate density and velocity respectively (the product pv being known as the acoustic resistance of the medium). In another paper Lane and Bieler describe experiments on the magnetic susceptibility of sodium and potassium, the results (0-65 X io-8 and o *54 X io-# respectively for mass suscepti- bility) being in good agreement with Pauli 's calculations. Henderson shows that tourmaline crystals can be used as piezo-electric resonators. Messrs. Shipley and Goodeve give an account of their work on the effect of high voltage arcs under water, finding that the decomposition effected is much in excess of that indicated by Faraday's law - probably as a result of thermal decomposition. Finally, Prof. J. C. McLennan and his collaborators contribute a number of papers of a spectroscopic character. We have received a number of copies of the Bell Labora- tories Record - a monthly magazine printed by the Bell Tele- phone Laboratories, Inc., N.Y., for the information of the laboratory staff. It is quite the best staff magazine we have yet seen, and the pages devoted to club matters, insurance, and personalia show that those in control of the organisation really</page><page sequence="6">NOTES Soi take a keen and practical interest in the welfare of the staff. Two-thirds of each number is devoted to articles, one of which is usually of general scientific interest, while the others refer to matters of special importance in telephony. For example, the October number (Vol. 7, No. 2) contains an account of the work of the American Nobel Laureates in physics, by K. K. Darrow ; an article on the acoustics of the auditorium, by E. C. Wente ; a description of a few of the relays used in the Bell system, and another describing some of the keys used on manual telephone switchboards. All these articles are illustrated by diagrams and photographs of quite exceptional merit. The Bell Laboratories have recently prepared a new magnetic alloy, which they call Permivar - containing 45 per cent, nickel, 25 per cent, copper, and 30 per cent. iron. The properties of the alloy depend very much on its heat treatment, and when this is carried out in a prescribed manner the hysteresis loss per cycle per c.c. of metal with a maximum induction of 100 gauss is only 2*5 x io~* ergs as compared with 1 erg for iron and 3 '3 X io-8 ergs for permalloy. The magnetic properties of permivar make it very suitable for the cores of telephone circuit loading coils. In an account in Nature (Oct. 20, 1928) of the proceedings of the World Fuel Conference held during the period September 23-October 6, attention is drawn to the extraordinary neglect (? exploitation) of the domestic user in this country. His total consumption of coal is about 23 per cent, of the total production - more than that of all the railways, gas, and electrical com- panies combined. He pays twice as much per ton as the industrial user, and obtains at this extravagant cost an inferior product sold under a fancy name without the exact specification (such as calorific value, ash or stone, content, etc.), which forms the basis of coal purchases in industry. It is indeed time that an official body should be constituted to define and maintain a standard of quality in the different classes of coal supplied for domestic use. Vol. X, No. 2 of the Journal of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Commonwealth of Australia, contains a brief note on the " flying fox " problem in Queensland and New South Wales. The so-called " flying fox " is really a large bat, Pteropus poliocephalus being the commonest species. " Nocturnal in habit and very gregarious, these animals live in large camps of hundreds of thousands of indivi- duals. They migrate according to season and food supply, but usually return to the same camps in successive seasons. In the day-time they cling to the branches of trees in dense numbers ; they are restless and alert, and a single gun-shot will put the whole camp in flight. At night they depart in search of food</page><page sequence="7">502 SCIENCE PROGRESS such as fruit, berries, eucalyptus flowers, and honey. They are particularly fond of cultivated fruit, and the damage they can do in an orchard in one night is appalling. The amount of fruit eaten is relatively small, but the ground is strewn with material which has been merely nibbled or claw-marked." Many obvious methods of destruction have been tried, but in every case the scale of possible operations has proved to be hopelessly inadequate. It has at last been decided to appoint a special investigator for a period of two years at a salary of £ 600 per annum, whose chief duty it will be to study the biology of the animal with a view to its possible control. Wholesale slaughter is necessary even to keep the pest from increasing ; even now it constitutes a most serious menace to fruit- growers in the affected States. A longer and more important paper in this number of the Journal deals with the wastage of Australian fruit during the voyage to England and after the fruit reaches the market. Bitter pit in Cox's Orange Pippin and Cleopatra form the most serious source of loss on the voyage, but in 1927 internal break- down caused large losses during distribution. Thus with three boxes of 2' in. apples the following results were obtained : Box i. Cox's Orange Pippin, Collinsdale : Days from discharge ... 5 10 18 30 Internal breakdown . . . 07% 12*8% 25*0% 33*8% Box 2. Ribston Pippin, Latrobe : Days from discharge ... 3 9 18 Internal breakdown . . . 4*°% 20 '5% 3%'5% Box 3. Ribston Pippin, Tasmania : Days from discharge ... 6 19 Internal breakdown . . .2-5% 16-5% Further investigation of the conditions of picking, packing and transit is required to ascertain the cause of such rapid deterioration. Losses on pears were chiefly due to over-ripeness when gathered. The condition of grapes on arrival in England is very uncertain, and further investigation is required. The importance of the work both to the Australian grower and to the European consumer is obvious. The data given above were obtained by the British Food Investigation Board. Further investigations of the Kimberley Horse Disease confirm the already published conclusion that it occurs when horses are allowed to eat the leaves of Atalaya hemiglauca (Whitewood), a tall shrub which is to be found in all parts of North Australia. It seems extremely probable that the ill effects produced by the Atalaya are due to its saponin content (from 3*5-4 per cent.). Pathological examinations show changes in the liver similar to those which occur in Winton disease (New Zea-</page><page sequence="8">NOTES 503 land) and dunziekte (S. Africa). Winton disease has been shown to be due to ingestion of Senecio Jacobœa (ragwort) which the investigators of Kimberley disease have now tested and shown to be fairly rich in saponin. It is evident that a fertile line of inquiry into various obscure stock diseases has been opened up. (Commonwealth of Australia : Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, Bulletin No. 36). Antiquity (edited by O. G. S. Crawford, F.S.A., and published by John Bellows, Gloucester) is, perhaps, the only journal devoted solely to archaeology which may occasionally be seen on a station bookstall. To all who are especially concerned with that subject it is, no doubt, familiar already, but an appeal is made to a wider circle. Its articles comprise both summaries of technical reports which have been published else- where and original researches. In No. 6, Vol. II, June 1928, Randall-Maclver contributes the second part of the " Fore- runners of the Romans," which deals with the pre- Etruscan Iron Age peoples of Italy. Two of the largest dolmens in Central France, near Tours, are described and figured by Vice- Admiral Boyle Somerville. The capstone of one of them is estimated to weigh 86 tons, and the organising of the army of over 3,000 men required to place it in position must be accounted one of the most amazing feats performed by pre- historic man. An article by Eric Thompson entitled " The ' Children of the Sun ' and Central America " is somewhat violently antagonistic to the ideas of the " Manchester School." Illustrating his point by the archaeological history of Cranborne Chase and Grovely Forest in Wiltshire, the editor contends that there was a definite break between the civilisations of Roman and Saxon times in England. Other articles deal with the evidence of ancient cultivations at Grassington in Yorkshire and the library of Alexandria. There are notes on numerous recent excavations carried out in many different parts of the world, and 29 reviews. In its matter and style Antiquity is fully maintaining the high standard of its earlier parts. Although frankly opinionated in its attitude towards certain theories, this quarterly serves a most useful purpose in keeping all interested in its subject in touch with many varied aspects of the most recent research. Sir Ronald Ross's Archives, containing many original papers and letters, notebooks and other documents, connected with his work on Malaria and Mosquitoes, have been sold to Lady Houston for £2,000. On the other hand sixteen mahogany chairs have recently been sold at Christie's for 1,450 guineas. Evidently modern Britons think as much of their seats as of their senses.</page></plain_text>
