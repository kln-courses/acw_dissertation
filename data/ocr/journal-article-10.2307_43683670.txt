Crosscutting Concepts in Science SUBMISSION DEADLINE: ONGOING Л FrametvorĶfor К- 12 Science Education and Next Generation Science Standards identify crosscutting concepts of science - those big ideas that "bridge disciplinary boundaries" and have "explanatory value throughout much of science and engineer- ing." The seven crosscutting concepts are: 1. Patterns 2. Cause and effect: Mechanism and explanation 3. Scale, proportion, and quantity 4. Systems and system models 5. Energy and matter: Flows, cycles, and conservation 6. Structure and function 7. Stability and change Have you found a way to effectively teach these crosscut- ting concepts in your science classes? If so, please share them with our readers. Activities and Investigations SUBMISSION DEADLINE: ONGOING Activities and investigations play a central role in all science courses. Do you have a new activity that promotes inquiry and allows students to better understand important science content? Have you found ways to improve on an old favor- ite or to integrate technology? What about low-cost alterna- tives? Have you modified an activity to align it with the Next Generation Science Standards or created a new investigation with these new standards in mind? TST is looking for manu- scripts describing interesting, practical investigations that can be incorporated into science classrooms and laboratories. Science and Engineering SUBMISSION DEADLINE: JUNE 1, 2014 The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) - and the FrametvorĶfor К- 12 Science Education upon which they are built - note the importance of integrating engineering into the structure of science instruction. Including engineering as an essential element of science education can help students see how engineering and science are relevant to everyday life. It also can lead to an appreciation of how engineering design is instrumental in addressing major challenges facing our modern world, such as preventing and treating diseases, improving the availability of food and clean water, and solving pressing global environmental problems. Have you created a successful engineering activity, unit, or course? Found ways to integrate engineering principles in chemistry, biology, physics, or Earth science classes? If so, please share them with TSTs readers. Disciplinary Core Ideas: Ecosystems SUBMISSION DEADLINE: April 1, 2014 The Next Generation Science Standards - and the Framework^ for K-12 Science Education upon which they are built - iden- tify "Ecosystems: Interactions, Energy, and Dynamics" as one of the disciplinary core ideas of life science. These complex systems can be small or large, and the future of planet Earth depends on our understanding the dynamic interactions and the natural and anthropomorphic threats to these systems. Please share your teaching tips for this central concept. Science for All SUBMISSION DEADLINE: ONGOING TST is seeking manuscripts for this annual issue devoted to the inclusion of all learners. The issue offers ideas and strategies to mitigate academic achievement gaps associated with ethnic- ity, socioeconomic status, gender, physical disabilities, limited English-language proficiency, learning differences, and even gifted abilities. Commentaries SUBMISSION DEADLINE: ONGOING Commentaries of approximately 750 words on any second- ary education topic are accepted at any time. Do you have thoughts on science education that you would like to share with your peers? Write up a Commentary and submit it to TST for review. 56 The Science Teacher</page></plain_text>
