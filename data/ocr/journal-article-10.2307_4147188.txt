DAVID NIBERT Wittenberg University dnibert@wittenberg.edu Until recently, sociologists have remained largely silent on human treatment of the oth- er species that also are indigenous to the planet. When other animals appear in socio- logical works, they generally are presented as objects, as natural resources, commodities, or research tools. In introductory texts, the dif- ferences between humans and other animals are punctuated by contrasting human-mind- edness with the purportedly simple behav- iors of other animals who, it has long been asserted, do not possess selfhood. This state of affairs is beginning to change. Sociological articles, books, and journals on other animals are now emerging, and a new section on Animals and Society has been established within the American Sociological Association. It is within this context that Leslie Irvine has come forward with a bold and groundbreaking book that challenges one of the discipline's long-held tenets-that other animals do not possess a self. Grounded in ethnographic research conduct- ed in a shelter for other animals, and supple- mented by auto-ethnographic study (an application of Verstehen) and interviews with humans who share their lives with other ani- mals, Irvine's thesis is that other animals do possess selfhood. Irvine lays the groundwork for her posi- tion by placing the Western perception of other animals in historical context, chroni- cling the rise of the historical moment that permits scientific consideration of the self- hood of other animals, particularly cats and dogs. She discusses why cats and dogs were relatively easy to domesticate and traces the gradual elevation of other animals within Western cultures and the accumulation of sci- entific evidence that refutes the Cartesian view of other animals as machines. Irvine challenges traditional explanations for why some humans choose to nurture relationships with other animals. She rejects the ideas that dogs and cats are mere surrogates for rela- tions with other humans, that the keeping of other animals as "pets" has been merely a fetish of the affluent, and that these relation- ships are largely manifestations of human tendencies to exert power over nature. If You Tame Me also deconstructs the sociobiologi- cal explanation for human relationships with other animals and instead suggests that such relationships exist because other animals possess "cognition, emotions, and other com- ponents of selfhood" and because "they are minded, sentient participants in interaction" (p. 77). Irvine maintains that the mindedness of other animals contributes to the selfhood of humans who interact and develop rela- tionships with them. Irvine shifts from the historical and theo- retical to the empirical to reveal the com- plexities of the adoption process at the shelter for other animals where she volun- teered, and she provides a view of the inter- actions between potential adopters and the residents of the shelter. She categorizes those humans she encountered at the shelter as "visitors" who are gaining glimpses into the personalities and mindedness of those up for adoption and envisioning the possible selves they would develop if they opened their lives to a particular cat or dog. While visitors may be like window shoppers, Irvine found that serious adopters seek "connection" with a particular "coherent, embodied being" (p. 101). Irvine returns to the theoretical and delves into both the richness and limitations of the theories of George Herbert Mead to construct a compelling argument that other animals have a "core self' and that "animals help cre- ate human identity by interacting with us as selves in relation to us" (p. 116). While the emergence of a core self in other animals does not require language, Irvine maintains that, in the absence of language, their self- hood becomes apparent to humans during interaction and through the development and maintenance of relationships. She rejects the reductionistic critiques of those who shrug off this process as mere anthropomorphism. Irvine maintains that the core self of other animals can be validated through a process of "critical anthropomorphism." She presents evidence that other animals possess agency, coherence, affectivity, and self-history, which together form their subjectivity.

This work both expands the sociological imagination and opens the door to researchers to explore human relationships with other species of animals. If cats and dogs have core selves and are deserving of respect, then do cows, pigs, and birds, for example, also possess core selves? And what does the selfhood of so many other species mean for humans' relations with and treatment of them? This important and compelling work should be read by all sociologists, and Irvine's accessible style also makes it a very useful text for both undergraduate and grad- uate courses.</page></plain_text>
