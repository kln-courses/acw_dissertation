JOHNSON the purpose of this study was to examine the reader in grades four through six with regard to the manner in which his attitude toward certain thematic content is related to his comprehension of reading selections. Three themes were utilized in the study. The first theme, labeled the anthropomorphic, was found in success stories of animals who possess the virtuous human characteristics of honesty, humility, courage, and who are the principal story characters. The second theme was based on the victorious under dog or weaker story character who played the principal role in the tales. The third theme was concerned with the primary story char acter who possessed definite culturally-alien attributes that facili tated group endeavor and harmony. The specific procedures adopted are presented below: 1. After the most common reading themes inherent within chil dren's stories at the intermediate grade level had been deter mined by a survey of the literature, typical intermediate grade reading selections believed to be characterized by these themes were selected by a panel on the basis of consensus. The main criterion utilized was consistency of theme throughout a given story. Three stories were selected at each grade level of each theme. This was done in order to compensate for differences in author, style, and mood. Each child read a total of nine stories. 2. An attitude inventory was then constructed for each theme by using procedures recommended by Thurstone. In selecting items for the inventories, judges sorted 200 opinions reflecting a given attitude into seven categories spaced along a con tinuum of favorableness. (The opinions were derived from intermediate grade children.) Thus, each category contained items which appeared equally more favorable than items in the preceding category and equally less favorable than items placed in the following category. This permitted a rank order 276</page><page sequence="2">Johnson: Relationships between attitudes reflected in thematic content 277 ing over the entire continuum of the attitude according to an equal-in-appearance gradation of items. 3. A sample of children in grades four, five, and six was selected from the student body of two elementary schools of the Albe marle County Public School System. Final selection was based on an obtained range of abilities in reading and on an obtained range of attitudes, intellectual level, and sex. Because the primary focus was on the relationship of certain attitudes to reading comprehension existing among intermediate grade children, the preceding information was obtained in order to assure that the children to be studied were distributed over the entire reading ability, intellectual level, and attitudinal range. 4. Comprehension tests were administered to all of the children in the population sample. These were constructed by writing ten literal comprehension questions and ten interpretative questions for each of the stories chosen. This procedure per mitted part scores for each of the major types of comprehen sion as well as a total score. Criteria for item selection were derived on the basis of the operational definitions, construct validity, face or logical validity, and consensus among the investigator's chairman, two advanced doctoral candidates in the field of reading, and the investigator. 5. The analysis of data was accomplished through the variance and covariance techniques of multiple linear regression. The resultant products of the correlations and regression equations used in the analysis were obtained through utilization of an electronic computer. Covariance techniques permitted the control of variables found to significantly affect the relationship between attitude and recalled comprehension response. This permitted the conclusions derived to be generalized to real populations. The variables found to signifi cantly affect this relationship were those of sex, chronological age, school, grade level, socio-economic status, and intelligence level. The conclusions drawn may be generalized to real populations, especially with regard to reading achievement, because a test for normality indicated that scores on the Durrell-Sullivan Reading Achievement Test were distributed normally. It was concluded that significant differences in total recalled comprehension could not be traced to differences in anthropo morphic attitude, underdog attitude, or culturally-alien attitude. It was further concluded that significant differences in literal compre hension response to reading materials of a culturally-alien theme could be attributed to differences in a culturally-alien attitude and that significant differences in recalled interpretative response could be attributed to differences in underdog attitude.</page></plain_text>
