The Tiibingen collection is a large one: Watzinger published the Greek vases in 1924, and several earlier CVA fascicles have also dealt with the mainline Greek fabrics; the collection is one which was at least partially formed with the foresighted intention of being represent- ative and as comprehensive as possible for a University collection-it contains large bodies of material from older collections, as well as items deliberately acquired late last century or earlier in this one as a teaching and research tool-Hartwig, for example, bought two collec- tions for the Institut in Rome in 1910. A sizeable group of the material described here is rare in this kind of context, and there are some weird and wonderful things in it. The Apulian red-figure is probably the least striking, though there is a dramatic standed oinochoe with a wheeling chariot (pl. 14) and a finely moulded head-vase with a confrontational bearded face (pl. 18). Three owl vases, one in pseudo-black-figure, one a charming double vase (pl. 19), are among the minor rarities of a collection which aims to be representative of its fabrics. A Gnathian bell krater showing a satyr carrying a kantharos (pl. 24) is a rare example in a tech- nique which more usually lends itself to patterns which tend to look as if they were applied with a nozzle. The Teano and Xenon Groups, and some black glaze, some of it relief-decorated, follow. The matt painted wares which represent a pioneering interest in the native pottery of not-quite Hellenised Italy are the content of the latter fifteen plates. Here there are the familiar fantastic Daunian bird-spouted jugs and dippers which are in fact quite common in European museum collec- tions, but there are also the much less familiar vessels with a tracery of fine floral patterns (pls. 50-3) and a double askos with faces and fish (54). There are enough of them to illustrate what is in fact a progression from the coarser wares of Daunian I in the sixth century BC to the third-century rococo of Daunian III. This is in itself a major benefit of this well researched and illus- trated fascicle-it is a good guide to the appearance of these less-understood fabrics. And at the end there are three worthy additions to the gallery of Canosan ash urns: askoi with moulded terracotta attachments, them- selves standard Hellenistic figurines, but in this context as bizarre as the patterned wares which precede them, an elegant reminder of the fusion of cultures in which they were produced.

Berlin and New York: Walter de Gruyter, 1997. Pp. ix + 81 + ill. DM 112. 31101- 48617. This small monograph assembles and stylistically orders a type of black-figure lekythos made in South Italy and Sicily during the fourth-century BC. Named after the scholar who first presented them as a group in 1912, they are often simply decorated with floral ornament and an animal, woman, or woman's head as the most common subject matter. Rolf Hurschmann's contribution is that he has been able to associate most of the lekythoi with specific Campanian, Paestan, and Sicilian red-figure workshops. An introduction reviews earlier scholarship on the vessels, their characteristics, including shape and subject matter, proveniences, function, and the use of the black- figure technique on other types of vases in South Italy. Five chapters follow, the first four of which are devoted to a specific fabric: Campanian, Paestan, Sicilian, Etruscan, and South Italian of uncertain origin. Lists of lekythoi attributed to different painters or workshops are accompanied by pertinent comments on the stylistic and iconographical characteristics and peculiarities of each major group, as well as any development in shape. The Campanian lekythoi are associated primarily with two workshops, those of the CA Painter and the Caivano Painter, although some cannot be assigned to any particular workshop. H. concludes that far fewer of the Pagenstecher lekythoi are Campanian than had been previously thought; forty-three are given in his lists. Several vases are attributed to these two red-figure painters, correctly from those I've checked; the others are considered workshop products. The 129 Paestan lekythoi fall into two major groups: one is connected directly with the workshop of Asteas and Python, although none is by either painter; the other, late Paestan, is connected primarily with the workshops of the Painters of Naples 1778 and 2585. The rich use of added colors is characteristic of the Paestan pieces, and the only mythological scene known to date on any Pagenstecker lekythos is the Judgement of Paris on a Paestan one in New York. The Sicilian lekythoi are generally the smallest in size and number about the same as the Paestan. One group is connected with the Lentini Painter's workshop, including several by him. The others are classed either as those with painted decoration or undetermined Sicilian. In the final two chapters H. lists three Etruscan lekythoi and twenty whose fabric is indeterminable. The apparatus which follows includes Addenda, catalogue of motifs, register and concordance. Thirty-six high quality plates and a Beilage with drawings of ornament at the end provide good illustrations for the text. Only profile drawings are missed. This is an excellent study, not too wordy, clear and straightforward. H. is to be congratulated, both for his meticulous compilation, including many unpublished examples from often difficult to access sources, as well as for providing the framework for any future work on this class of vessels.

Ridgway's ongoing series of surveys has passed another milestone, and once again the virtues of the four preceding volumes-erudition, originality, liveliness, generosity, and evenhandedness-are present in quantity. An invaluable, often unconventional, and always 227</page><page sequence="2">NOTICES OF BOOKS thought-provoking synopsis of the material, this book will receive heavy usage from students and teachers alike. The format is traditional. After a brief introduction come chapters on architectural sculpture; reliefs; person- alities (spotlighting Lysippos); and other genres. Though the period is more tidily defined by R.'s own output than art-historically (her Fifth-Century Styles stopped at 400 and her Hellenistic Sculpture I begins in 330), her discussion is full and well documented, and pays explicit and welcome attention to stylistic pluralism and to the periphery. Only portraits and athletes are somewhat shortchanged. When we part company, it is mostly over details and argumentation. In particular, an (entirely laudable) desire to present all sides of the case and a lecturer's habit of throwing in 'random observations' sometimes make her text resemble an extended footnote. Strings of disjunc- tive particles create a seesawing effect that tends to leave the reader somewhat queasy. Specialists will welcome her openness, resistance to easy and/or conven- tional answers, and zest for controversy, but students tell me they often find her arguments hard to follow. Grouping pros and cons together would help. In one area-personalities (Chs. 7-8)-our differences are more serious. What did the great fourth-century masters-not merely sculptors-really achieve? To R., this 'period ... stressed continuity over originality' (265). To the Hellenistic and Roman critics, and to me, it did the opposite. Its practitioners-sculptors, painters, and architects-some brilliantly original, took their high classic heritage in an amazing variety of directions. (One Italian colleague compares our clash on this issue with the 'cold' fourth-century economy envisioned by Polanyi and Finley and the 'hot' one favoured by many contemporary historians.) To support her case, R. cites a supposedly universal 'ancient belief that tradition is to be preferred over originality', but warns against 'fabricating just such a sequence because it appears logical to us' (19, her italics). Yet regarding the Great Masters she seems to do just this, resurrecting a fin-de-siecle version of her mentor Rhys Carpenter's 'art without artists' by sternly exiling the heterodox to the Hellenistic period or to Rome. Sometimes her prosecutorial zeal turns into special pleading: one strike and it's out. All this suggests, first, that R. has yet to escape fully from Carpenter's shadow; and second, that like him she instinctively still prefers what the Parisian art historian and critic Georges Didi-Huberman has aptly called euchrony, a smooth, untroubled landscape that denies what he terms 'anachronism', the sheer jagged messiness of history (Artforum, Jan. 1995, 64-5). Unfortunately, this kind of historical idealism just creates bigger potholes down the road. For if these later periods were so inventive and their products so popular in copy, why did the ancient critics uniformly judge them bankrupt and third-rate? R.'s Praxiteles is a case in point. 'Suspecting' that the Pouring Satyr is Hellenistic or Roman because of its thoroughgoing and revolutionary anthropomorphism (266), she ventures that the numerous fourth-century Athenian banquet reliefs where the type does duty as a winepourer provided the inspiration for it. This at once cruelly orphans these multiple siblings, reverses the normal logic of art-historical causality, and so impover- ishes the Satyr's supposed latter-day creator that he must pilfer the fourth century's least significant sculptural genre for inspiration. If the Satyr returns to the Praxitelean fold, what of the rest? What of the Sauroktonos, whose 'effeminate appearance, slender forms, and peculiar activity, ... more in common with later concepts and renderings' leave R. 'uneasy' (265); and the Arles Aphrodite, which she reassigned to the second century over twenty years ago? (Yet the latter is echoed on a Kerch-style hydria in Athens, NM 12592, and a poros statuette from an Agora deposit of c. 350, S 965.) As to the Knidia, R. likes the theory of another pupil of Carpenter's, Christine Havelock, that she was far from being immediately inaugurative-one of Walter Benjamin's famous 'eddies in the stream of becoming' (The Origins of German Tragic Drama (1928/1963; Eng. tr. by G. Steiner (1977) 45). Instead, she stood forgotten for two hundred years before her sudden 'rediscovery' in (surprise!) the later second century. But Havelock's contention rests on a shaky combination of negative evidence (no surviving Hellenistic texts and no precisely dated Hellenistic versions either) and special pleading (the piece-by-piece down-dating of what we do have), and discounts Pliny's clear implication that the Knidia's fame was instantaneous (N.H. 36.20-22: illo enim signo Praxiteles nobilitavit Cnidum, etc.). This piecemeal assault on the evidence is murder by inches-a sort of archaeological Death By A Thousand Cuts. And now the Knidia stands bereft and alone in the fourth century, no doubt some overzealous camp-follow- er will soon banish her too to the second, where one or two remote scions of the Praxiteles clan still kept the family trade just barely alive: 'Knidia eines Praxiteles?' Yet I cannot end on a negative note. Reviewing an earlier book of R.'s in the same series fifteen years ago, I wrote that, 'Our common house has many mansions, and on her own territory Ridgway's pre-eminence is self-evident. Her enthusiasm kindles ours, her perceptiveness sharpens our own; she helps us all to see Greek sculpture with fresh eyes, and one can hardly ask for more' (Art Bulletin 65 (1983) 175). Nothing has changed. ANDREW STEWART University of California at Berkeley KAMPEN (N.) Ed. Sexuality in Ancient Art: Near East, Egypt, Greece, and Italy. Cambridge UP, 1996. Pp. xviii + 299. ?45.00 (?15.95 pb.). 0521470- 994 (0521476836 pb.). From the beginning, it is clear that Kampen has produced an important book which breaks much new ground, and will be a standard work for some time. Her collection of seventeen specially commissioned essays is coherent and clear, and remarkably free of the 'curate's egg' factor which bedevils so many edited books. The contributors talk to each other while discussing very different kinds of evidence: several of their papers cover in one way or another the disjunction between the plastic arts and social life, for instance.
