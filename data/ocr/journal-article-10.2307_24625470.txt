<plain_text><page sequence="1">Edith Boyd. Origins of the Study of Human Growth. Based on unfinished work left by Richard E. Scammon. Bhim Sen Savara and John Frederick Schilke, eds. Portland, Oregon, Child Study Clinic, School ofDentistry, University of Oregon Health Sciences Center, 1980. xxviii, 676 pp., illus. $65.00, plus $3.00 postage and handling. Reviewed by Ja ne M. Oppenheimer, Professor Emeritus of Biology and History of Science, Bryn Mawr College, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania 19010. Richard Scammon opened a laboratory of human growth and development in 1914; Edith Boyd began to work with him in 1924. By 1929, Scammon started to plan a comprehensive study on development and growth; his collec tion of data grew and grew, and beginning in 1937 the Commonwealth Fund provided financial help to finish and publish a book. Scammon retired in 1949 and died three years later, leaving that book unfinished. After his death and until her own death in 1977, Boyd reworked Scammon's manuscript and notes, con densing and simplifying his text, eliminating illustrations (184 still remain, over and above several portraits, none of Scammon). After a gestation of some fifty five years, the book was published in 1980. It is large in format (11% inches high) and it will tell you all you could wish to know about human growth. The book is divided into two principal parts. Part I, 'The Beginnings (An tiquity to 1700),' covering 257 pages, has a bibliography of 674 items. Part II,</page><page sequence="2">504 Journal of the History of Medicine : October ig8i (1700-1940), covers 375 pages and its bibliography numbers 1,348 entries. Part I contains chapters on a number of geographical areas, highly varied; they fre quently overlap chronologically. For instance, chapter I deals with Mesopotamia from 4000 B.c. to 50 B.c., chapter II with China from antiquity to 200 A.D. The final three chapters abandon geography and take up in turn three more general topics: the Renaissance, seventeenth-century Europe, and folklore. Each of these chapters, except for that on folklore, is divided into sections headed 'Zeitgeist,' 'Stages of Human Life,' 'Developmental Anatomy,' and 'Quantification.' Part II begins by devoting a chapter for each of these four subjects for the period 1700 to 1840, then discusses them in a number of chapters covering 1840 to 1940. Most of the concluding chapters deal with anthropomorphic measurements. A short chapter by Edith Boyd on internal measurements, incomplete when she died, is presented unrevised as an appendix. This vast book, labor of love that it represents, is almost too much of a good thing. Perhaps the collection of data was selective, and Dr. Boyd's preface states that she has pruned what Dr. Scammon left behind, but one still has the impres sion that Scammon, or Boyd, or both have presented all that had been said about growth in their times. One wishes that the content had been divided among sev eral less unwieldy volumes. Readers interested in a study of the height of New comb College women in 1930 and 1931 might care less for reading about the Zeitgeist in Egypt from 3500 B.c. to 200 A.D., and vice versa. The most valuable contribution of the book—and valuable it is—for embryologists and historians of embryology and medicine are the sections presenting unfamiliar data on an cient theories of development. While some of the many pictorial illustrations relating to these are familiar, many are new. There is no other history of em bryology that presents all of the truly fascinating material on the ancient ideas that is collected here. The authors would have been wise to present ancient theories of growth in a smaller book devoted to them solely. Had the broad topics of this extensive book been presented in several smaller volumes, the read er might have been better served; but we should be grateful that we have this work at all.</page></plain_text>
