<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK NOTES by C. L. Sonnichsen Reprints of Special Interest: Frank Bird Linderman's Quartzville was put together shortly before the author's death in 1938. Parts of it had been published previously as articles in newspapers and magazines but he called it a novel and used the techniques of fiction. His pictures of life in a Montana mining camp are so spirited and accurate, however, that they qualify as social history and would be convincing if they were set in Colorado or Arizona. The book is a "western" without a gunfight but it is rich in the details of everyday life that made Quartzville (Marysville) both unique and typical: Cornish Cousin Jacks singing, a whiskey-loving bear, mining-camp love, the local doctor (the narrator) at work. Linderman brings us about as close as we are likely to get to the West-that-Was as it really was. His work is published as a book for the first time by the Mountain Press (Missoula, Montana, 1985, $9.95, soft cover; $15.95, hard cover). It is a ready-made classic. Francis Paul Prucha's monumental The Great White Father , an exhaustive review of relations between the Indian tribes and the United States government (reviewed in the Summer, 1985, issue of JAH), has been reissued in condensed form as The Great Father (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1986, $9.95, soft cover; $26.50, hard cover). The two- volume edition, fully documented, was priced at $60.00 - out of reach of students and most scholars. The present volume, condensed and without notes, contains all essential information and will be welcomed by all persons interested in Native American history. The late Henry Pickering Walker, retired Army colonel and assistant editor of Arizona and the West , specialized in Western commerce and [97]</page><page sequence="2">THE JOURNAL OF ARIZONA HISTORY transportation and in 1966 produced an important book - The Wagon- masters : High Plains Freighting from the Earliest Days of the Santa Fe Trail to 1880. It was well turned out, well documented, well illustrated, well written, and well reviewed. Walker explored many facets of freighting on the Santa Fe and Overland trails - the people, the methods, the dangers and adventures, the economics, and the military aspects of the business. A new edition of this important book (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1986, $11.95, soft cover) is welcome and useful. An on-the-scene account of soldiers' lives during the Geronimo campaigns of the 1880s appeared in Outing magazine from April to July, 1886. Written by Lieutenant John Bigelow, Jr., it was actually a series of reports from the field. Bigelow was an officer of the Negro Tenth Cavalry, which participated in the toilsome, tedious, and sometimes terrifying pursuit of the elusive Apaches. No better picture exists of life in the camps and on the trail - the heat, the boredom, the frustration that had to be endured as the Apaches struck and vanished. Bigelow knew he was writing for publication, and he included some good reporting on the mines, the ranches, and the people of southern New Mexico and Arizona. The lieutenant and his "buffalo soldiers" were not present when Geronimo and Naiche finally gave up, but they played their part and did their share. First published as a book in 1958, On the Bloody Trail of Geronimo is Bigelow's classic account of the Indian wars, and Lynn Bailey's Westernlore Press has done well to reprint it in facsimile ($13.95 hard cover), complete with the Remington drawings and Arthur Woodward's useful and gracefully written introduction. When the University of Arizona opened on October 1, 1891, four buildings (a barn, a pumphouse, a chemistry lab, and Old Main) were the sole occupants of its forty desert acres far removed from downtown Tucson. Two young women and one man received diplomas at the first commencement in 1895. Ninety years later, in 1985, close to 150 buildings overflowed the original site in all directions and almost 30,000 students were at work in 351 fields. How would one go about recording an expansion of this magnitude? Phyllis Ball, who arrived in Tucson as a child in 1928, graduated from the university, and spent the rest of her life with the university library, decided to tell the story with pictures. She selected from the thousands of photographs in the university's collections close to 800 portraits, campus scenes, aerial views, and photographs of individual buildings, visually documenting the growth of the campus, president by president and structure by structure. The people are there, individually and in groups, [98]</page><page sequence="3">Book Notes but the emphasis is on bricks and mortar - physical growth. Complementing the photos are an easy-running text, maps of the campus in various stages of development, and a final series of charts showing the history of each individual building. Given in each case are the names of the architect and contractor, information about changes and alteration, and the date of demolition (if destroyed). The old buildings had lives and personalities of their own, and Editor Ball mourns the passing of each one as if it were a human friend. Her saddest page (301) shows Old South Hall (designed by Henry Trost) in all its white-columned glory and in its final moments with only the columns standing. The result of years of planning and hard work, this monumental volume will be priceless to all generations of U of A graduates. "I hope," says Phyllis, "there is a memory in this book for everyone who ever lived, attended, or served the University of Arizona." Her hope is justified.

Main entries include all the basic information about each title such as date(s) of publication, names of editor(s) and publisher(s), and where copies can be found in libraries. Most entries also include a historical summary and comments about the slant and purpose of the periodical. This is an excellent reference tool that should make any research related to Native Americans easier. - W. David Laird. The Central Arizona Project is the most expensive (3.6 million dollars) and one of the most controversial aqueducts ever conceived and built in the United States or elsewhere. It is already bringing water to the Phoenix area and is approaching Tucson, where it is scheduled to arrive by 1991. It will divert 1.5 million acre feet of water from the Colorado River each year (to the dismay of watershort California), but it will not solve Arizona's water problems. Even so, the project is a mammoth and magnificent display of human power and potential and deserves to be better known to the people it is designed to serve. [99]</page><page sequence="4">THE JOURNAL OF ARIZONA HISTORY To bring some idea of what the great enterprise looks like (most of us have caught only a glimpse or two of it as we go north or south from Phoenix), four photographers have joined forces to bring the CAP before our eyes - Mark Klett of ASU, Ann Simmons Myers of Tucson, Ruth Morand of Tucson, and Lawrence McFarland of the University of Texas at Austin. These artists have recorded in more than forty black-and-white and color photographs the look of the canal and the people who keep the water flowing. The Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona is the publisher (Tucson: University of Arizona Press, 1986, $9.95, paperback). ASU Professor William Jenkins comments truly in his introduction that from these remarkable photographs one realizes that "the thing is simply astonishing." First published in 1980 by the School of American Research, Polly Schaafsma's Indian Rock Art of the Southwest has been reissued in soft cover by the University of New Mexico Press ($24.95). Its 375 pages are packed with information about the figures "pecked and painted on cliffs, buildings, and cave walls throughout the Southwest." Arizona is particularly rich in these "ghostly rows of anthropomorphic forms with large, staring eyes, winged human figures, mountain sheep pierced with spears, bulging heads capped with antennae, lizard-men, humpbacked flute players, and Spanish soldiers on horseback." At first glance these creations form a "bewildering array," but Schaafsma finds in them "an amazing degree of order." She begins with a history of rock-art research, with paragraphs on the tools and problems of her business, then goes on to her real objective - a discussion of rock-art styles, with examples from 2,000 B.C. (the date of the earliest examples) to the historic period. "What emerges," says Douglas W. Schwartz of the School of American Research, "is a new way of viewing the overall configuration of Southwestern cultural history." Schaafsma regards her examples as "probably man's most enduring art form" but believes that rock-art investigation is "still in preliminary stages." Crisply written and illustrated with a profusion of drawings and photographs, the volume will seem, to most non-specialists, remarkably thorough and complete. It deserves to be kept alive and available. [100]</page></plain_text>
