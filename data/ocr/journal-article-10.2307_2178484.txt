THE idea of the reversibility of part or all of reality is not a new one. Often it has been the mere play of the specula- tive imagination; sometimes it has been (or at least the possi- bility of it has been) an important underlying issue in determining the framework of a system of thought. Perhaps, therefore, the best way to estimate the present importance of the problem would be to notice a few of these earlier historical appearances. In the logic of Aristotle the whole criticism of hypothetical reasoning rests upon the implied doctrine of the plurality of causes. It is valid to argue by 'affirming the antecedent' simply because it is assumed that from a given cause there can be but one effect. It is invalid to 'affirm the consequent' (as a premise) for the explicit reason that the same effect might have resulted from an indefinite and unknown number of causes. In other words, scientific reasoning must move in the forward direction; from an exhaustive knowledge of the cause we may deduce the necessary effect, while in face of an exhaustive knowledge of the effect the cause would remain indeterminate. Probably Aris- totle's doctrine of the four types of causality had something to do with this outcome. The entelechy, at least, was not a revers- ible thing. Final causes necessarily have a definite 'look' in time and one could no more reverse the process than, having looked at the sun with his eyes, a man might imagine the process reversed so that the visual sensation caused the light of the sun. Formal and material causes, as Aristotle defined them, have no 36i</page><page sequence="2">362 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. direct temporal quality; and even if in these cases the causes be interpreted as having some kind of position antecedent to their effects, they could scarcely be thought of as calculable, or their consequences as within the range of logical deduction. Efficient causation acts through time; and whether Aristotle thought it possible, in the realm of purely efficient causation, to argue from effect to producing cause or not, it is certain that the formal logicians have offered little objection to that procedure in the history of science. Final causes alone, then, as he represented them, were unequivocally irreversible. But as the four aspects of cause here discussed represent what, in the cosmos, is one integrated movement, he may have thought it unnecessary, in a work on logic, to concern himself with the distinction. Whether, therefore, apart from final causes, the principle of reversibility would have been denied, it is impossible to say; there is room for the suspicion that his answer to such a question would have depended upon whether Aristotle found himself in the deductive or the inductive frame of mind! Kant makes a much more important use of the principle of plural causes. With Aristotle it is simply a fact that events are so arranged in time that the antecedent determines the conse- quent without the relationship's being reciprocal. But Kant has taken it upon himself to account for the reality of time, the one element in the situation that Aristotle took for granted. And any complete derivation of the idea of time must involve the elemental distinction of past and future. We find, accordingly, a remarkable change in the situation. Time itself becomes but a form of mental reaction, and the distinction of past and future comes to rest, in turn, upon the asymmetry of the causal relation- ship. The direction in which we can calculate and manage experience is what we know as futurity and we speak of time as moving that way. That state of affairs adjacent to the present one which slips our grasp and, under the test of rigid calculation, vanishes into a haze of possibilities, is the direction of pastness. To use his own illustration: It is easy to show that if an iron ball is laid on a pillow it will make a depression in it; but from the fact of the depression merely it would be quite impossible to</page><page sequence="3">No. 4.] ON COSMIC REVERSIBILITY. 363 argue backward to its cause. An indefinite number and variety of things might have resulted in precisely this same depression. In other words, Kant agrees entirely with Aristotle so far as the principle of plurality of causes is concerned; the difference is that time direction, assumed as a matter of course by the Greek, becomes in the Kantian system itself a corollary of the direction of calculability in the causal series. On the other hand, there was growing up in modern times that great invention of man known as physical science. And oddly enough, in view of the dominating logic of Aristotle, this has always on its theoretical side been more a search for causes, than a tracing of effects from causes that were known. Whatever may have been the logical difficulties in the procedure, both observation and experiment were very often simply 'affirmation of the consequent,' and from this the investigator was to affirm the antecedent as best he might. With what success causes have been deciphered from their effects the history of science bears witness. The branch of science nearest to the simple principles of mechanics and geometry and in which, consequently, exact results were first obtained, was, of course, astronomy. And here, long before the time of Kant, the antecedents and consequents in celestial phenomena were treated as mathematically reciprocal so far as calculation from one to the other was concerned. Past eclipses were reidentified with exactly the same confidence with which future ones were predicted; having discovered an arc of the orbit of a body, it was as easy to tell whence it had come as to anticipate whither it would go. Everyone knows how, in the course of time, the success and simplicity and fascination of all this led to the sweeping assumptions and grandiose claims of the mechanistic philosophy. The whole world in space and time became an immense machine whose running might be calculated equally well in either direction and to the minutest detail if we but had the requisite data at hand. The universe became simply a problem in mechanics, and Laplace dreamed of a tremendous equation representing all existence in which, for a given value of 't,' plus or minus, the whole configuration of the cosmos might be deduced for any</page><page sequence="4">364 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. moment of time. And this, of course, is an ideally complete contradiction of the principle of plurality of causes with which we began, and still represents, no doubt, the final though un- realizable ideal of the mechanistic way of thinking. Whether, in addition to such mathematical reversibility, the machine itself might conceivably be reversed, is another matter. Suppose, that is, that every particle of matter could suddenly be made to right-about-face and start in the opposite direction with precisely the velocity it now possesses, would not the vast pageant of evolution run backward before our eyes like a cine- matograph performance in which the direction of the film had been reversed? At first sight, and on general principles, it seems plausible that such a thing could occur. The equations embody, in symbolic form, all the necessary laws according to which one configuration is connected with another; and, if the equations can be made to work backward without loss in deter- minateness, why not also the objective process they represent? Some, indeed, have made the claim in precisely this form. Helmholtz' held that a complete reversal of all atomic move- ments would, in just such a fashion, start the process of evolution backward; and at least the theoretical possibility of such a thing has become in many quarters a part of the tradition of physical science. In more modern work in philosophy still another attitude is not uncommon. We are told, for illustration, that if the mecha- nistic theory of the world were true, such complete reversibility would be a natural correlate of any description of it. Dr. Ward seems to consider such a possibility to be involved in the mecha- nistic ideal;2 as an offset to it he holds, on the other hand, that it is in the world considered as a 'Realm of Ends' that no such reversal could occur. To solve a mechanistic equation for a negative value of 't' would surely not be difficult; but who can imagine a desire working backward from its fulfillment to its origin, or an argument running from its conclusion back to its provocation? Professor Royce regarded it as an essential quality of purpose that it is irreversible in time,-so much so that, in 'Wissenschaftliche Abhandlungen, Bd. III, p. 594. 2 Naturalism and Agnosticism, Vol. I, p. 203.</page><page sequence="5">No. 4.] ON COSMIC REVERSIBILITY. 365 The World and the Individual, the presence of seemingly irre- versible processes in nature (like the death of an organism or the breaking of glass) are held to betray by analogy the presence of a cosmic Purpose and Life.' Professor Bergson, too, contrasts life and mechanism explicitly on this point, mechanism being regarded as inherently indifferent to time, while time or duration is of the very essence of life.2 He insists again and again that, so far as mere physics is concerned, 't' is an abstract quantity having only mathematical significance and which, since it deals only with simultaneities, may vary in one direction as freely as in the other. A planet or an atom in motion can go back to its starting-point; memory will not unwind, nor can the story of a life be construed backward. It is the aim of the present paper to point out that perhaps, even in this respect, too much has been conceded to mechanism. No doubt purposes and vital phenomena are incommensurable with any sort of mathematics of masses in motion and are nothing if abstracted from forward movement in time. Modern theory, with all its use of selection and survival and finalist, is infinitely more committed to the specific time order than was Aristotle's world of fixed forms. Sheer passive contemplation, too, could face the idea of a cosmic reversal with infinitely more intellectual equanimity than could the modern scientific temper of mind with its explicitly instrumental thinking and dependence upon tentative hypotheses and experimental programs. But putting all this aside; granting even the most naive and trans- parent conception of cosmic mechanism, it is possible to hold that the notion of a reversal is little more than a trick of words, and utterly inconceivable in detail. In specific cases it might be possible to manipulate things in the opposite order of their occurrence, but only by the most arbitrary selection of conditions; and in each case success would depend upon the continuation of contextual processes just as at present they are. And this, to say nothing of the direction of change in the ultimate independent variable. We shall seek, consequently, to show (a) that the basis of all this analogy, the human-made machine, can itself 1 The World and the Individual, Vol. II, pp. 2i6 ff. 2 Creative Evolution, Chapter I.</page><page sequence="6">366 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. be reversed in only a metaphorical and half-hearted way that is wholly inadequate to support the mechanistic inference in philosophy; (b) that in the specific phenomena of the particular sciences the idea of reversal leads only to confusion and absurdi- ties; (c) that the reversibility of the mathematical equations is so far from representing a reversal of the concrete processes that, on the contrary, it is generally inconsistent with it; and (d) finally, that reversibility cannot even be saved by the familiar distinction between spatial and temporal series. I. Whether or not it can be called 'anthropomorphism' in the strictest sense of the term, there can scarcely be any doubt that the mechanistic mode of thought has developed, as its name implies, from man's experience in making and dealing with machines. Clocks having been a fairly early invention so far as our civilization is concerned, not a little of the familiar terminology of the horologist permeates mechanistic speculation. The Universe is 'wound up' or is 'running down'; geological periods and astronomical cycles mark the hours of universal time. The finite machine is historically the archetype, and the ideal of the calculable universe is simply a vast analogy on the basis of it. Idealists and mechanists might even be said to differ first of all in the fact that the one objectifies and uni- versalizes the work of his mind, the other the work of his hands. In spite of this, however, the work of purpose in the structure of a machine is commonly neglected and it, as mechanical, is contrasted with things and processes distinguished as teleo- logical. It is well to notice, then, (a) that a strictly self-running machine does not exist, and (b) that none except the simplest machines are in any sense reversible in action, and most of them not at all. The more one thinks about it the more important becomes the easy and obvious reflection that no machine runs itself. Some- where there is a lever or a throttle, a key to touch or a release to turn, before any machine will perform even its own mechanical function. All machinery is an extension and amplification of human hands, and is ultimately as' helpless when the contact with those hands is broken as the hands themselves would be</page><page sequence="7">No. 4.] ON COSMIC REVERSIBILITY. 367 when severed from the rest of the organism. For practical purposes, perhaps, this connection of machines with the rest of human economy may be neglected; from the standpoint of ultimate theory that connection, if only mediated by the pres- sure of an electric button, is the nerve of the whole arrangement. It represents the contamination of pure mechanism by the strain of finality; and such interfering purpose must serve to polarize the whole arrangement in time. All this comes to light the moment the order of operation is to be changed. In such a case this human interference must amount to an essential change in the structure of the machine itself. The lever of a locomotive is thrown over and the result is a backward in place of the forward movement; but it is not the same machine it was before. It is now as explicitly constructed to run backward as it was before to run forward (neglecting for the moment the fact that, except for human customs and purposes, one direction is as much 'forward' as the other!); and it simply could not run in the original direction again until the one crucial element in its construction was arbitrarily altered accordingly. In other words, the engine as it is at any given moment is not reversible in its action, and no mere temporary reversal of all its movements (as might, for instance, be accomplished by a well cushioned and properly arranged head-on collision!) would make the machine itself a backward working one. As soon as the superior opposing force were removed, the engine would start back in the only direction in which, as it is, it can possibly go. Or who would think of trying to start a clock to running backward by giving all its wheels a sudden push in the opposite direction? And of course it is obvious that by the time it had been fixed so as to run backward it would no longer be a clock at all. It would seem at first sight as if nothing could be more ideally reversible than a simple mechanism such as a lever; but one is met by the same difficulties here. Under given conditions of stress a lever is anything but indifferent to the order of events. A sudden physical reversal of direction of movement would mean a progressive or continuous reversal only in one special case, i. e.,-where the motion of the lever was wholly a matter</page><page sequence="8">368 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. of antecedent momentum or, what is the same thing, where it was in perfect balance. But in any other case the reversal of movement would mean only the most trivial set-back in a process that in its main issue depends wholly on the character of the lever system itself,-of which character all differences of loading are, of course, an integral part. The only reasons why it should suggest itself at all as a reversible arrangement are (a) the ease with which the conditions of its working are altered, and (b) its very remoteness from the type of a 'closed system' which ultimately the cosmos, in current analogy, is taken to be. In the case, however, of anything like a complicated mechan- ical process, any conception of backward process is essentially grotesque. Consider, for instance, the suggestion that a book might be unprinted by running it backward through the press, or a stocking turned into a ball of yarn by giving the motion of the knitting machine a minus sign! In general, what is con- structed to turn A into Z in the course of its operation, would simply turn Z into chaos if started off in the opposite direction. The fact is that however glibly we may speak of the mere 'accident' of time direction and amuse ourselves with the thought of a sweeping cosmic reversal, no mechanism, just because it is a mechanism, is on that account capable, by any assumed negative movement, of undoing in simple order what it has done. How much less, then, may one dream that evolution might, by any mechanistic magic, become an involution that would resume its own history in reverse order! It is not enough to say that in this case the analogy breaks down; there is, strictly speaking, no assignable analogy to be broken. II. It is evident that, if a perfect machine be a perfectly reversible affair, no human machines have more than a negligible suggestion of such perfection. It might, however, be that, though mechanistic theory gets its cue from our human contriv- ances, it has the right in its ultimate speculations to abstract from the limitations and imperfections of practical mechanics. It would be well, then, to see if reversal would be any easier in the hypothetical world of present scientific theory. The pressure exerted by a gas, as, for instance, in the steam</page><page sequence="9">No. 4.] ON COSMIC REVERSIBILITY. 369 chest of an engine, is due to the kinetic energy with which the molecules, like minute projectiles, bombard the containing walls, -a truly remarkable thing when we remember that in ordinary practice these invisible bounding molecules of steam, infinitely smaller than the finest visible dust, must be considered to pro- duce, by the summation of their impacts, a moving force of 200 pounds or more a square inch! Yet, incredible as it seems to casual imagination, such is the active mechanism which, we are forced to believe, constitutes the body and the energy of heated gas. Take such a system as embodied in a former illus- tration and at the moment when the piston head is being pushed forward by the expanding steam; and neglect, for a moment, the molecular movements in the body of the steel itself. Sup- pose, then, that the sudden cataclysm of universal reversal should take place. The piston as itself a moving body would, of course, be given a backward momentum equal to its former forward one, and every flying molecule of the gas would also shunt through the corresponding i8o degrees of direction angle. The result would be, not that the working of the system as a whole, or even of the piston head alone, would be physically reversed. On the contrary, the forward pressure of the steam would be exactly what it was before the change; the tendency of a gas to expand does not depend upon the direction in which the molecules move, but only upon the condition that they shall move at random in all directions, and this state of affairs would not be altered in the least by the contemplated change. In other words, if the pressure laws of mechanics are assumed to hold, the body of expanding gas in question would suffer only the temporary check of having to catch up, by a moment of extra pressure, the work necessary to overcome the slight contrary momentum our magic would have given to the piston head, and then the process would proceed in the same direction in which it was going before. Perhaps, indeed, space and time might both be conserved by the observation that this very instance so clearly suggests, viz., that even in the merest mechanism consisting of nothing more than matter in motion, there are not lacking resultant effects</page><page sequence="10">370 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. that are in no wise due to the direction in which the motion of the ultimate parts takes place; and it is obvious that just in so far as the state of a mechanical whole does not depend upon the direction of motion of its parts, the universal change here under discussion would produce no final difference. As instances of such resultant processes might be mentioned, in addition to gaseous pressure, all cases of osmotic pressure, of molar heat, of the chemical and physical behavior of substances in solution, most cases of friction, etc. The only conspicuous exceptions, indeed, in the field of theoretical physics and chemistry, would be found, perhaps, in the ion theory of electrical conduction and the quantum theory of light. All ordinary chemical proc- esses then, and most of what we ordinarily class as physical, would simply not be affected at all when the direction of all ultimate movement was completely reversed. There would be little profit in carrying illustration further, unless indeed it were to point out that the more complex the phenomena considered the more grotesque and bizarre becomes the idea of a reversal. Let one try to imagine any such incident in the processes studied by geology. What, under the assumed inverted conditions, would become of erosion? Would watery once it were given a start, run up hill and, incidentally, carry its load of lime and sand and gravel back where it came from? If it be suggested that we should have to imagine the laws of nature-in this case the force of gravity-changed along with the direction of motion, the answer is two-fold: (a) Such a change, as we shall see later, would totally upset the mechanistic mathematics; and (b) even if the law of gravitation too were reversed we should entirely fail to get the geologic reversal. Under such circumstances surface water would not flow at all, up hill or down, but simply dash off perpendicularly into space, along with everything else that was loose on the planet,-every- thing that was not held back by some superior tension (such as, perhaps, a correspondingly inverted centrifugal force!). The simple fact is that geologic processes could not be reversed at all without the most arbitrary and elaborate interference with things, most of which interference would be hopelessly inconsistent with the reversal of neighboring concomitant processes.</page><page sequence="11">No. 4.] ON COSMIC REVERSIBILITY. 371 In biology, psychology, etc., it is useless to speculate. What would one mean by the working of metabolism backward? Would heat be produced or absorbed in the process? If the former, all laws of chemical action would have to be given a negative thermo-dynamic effect (in which case there is no evi- dence that, in a series of otherwise fairly stable substances, any- thing but explosions would be possible); and if heat were absorbed, it would require assumptions (as, for instance, that a sphere of radiation should contract itself toward a center by some new and unimaginable etherial elasticity) which would entirely cancel the remaining remnant of mechanism. In psy- chology, the contraction of muscles would have to lead to the sensation to which they were the response; or, the possession of a thing give rise to the desire for and the want of it, the reply give rise to the question it answered, etc., without end. At this point it may be well to forestall one obvious objection that might be raised against the present mode of treatment. We have, it may be said, no right to treat lines of causality in isolation. If the whole movement of the universe were reversed, the drop of water that had fallen in rain would find at hand the resultant of forces that would hurl it back again to the sky. Even the particles of air that before had impeded it would now, in a negative rush, contribute their energy to its upward flight. The equivalence of matter and energy between any two moments is complete, and the direction of exchange, in an ultimate mechanical sense, is indifferent,-however absurd that may seem to our conventional imagination. But in reality this represents no new point of view. In the first place (a) to continue the illustration, the friction and resistance of the air does not depend upon the direction of movement of the particles of the air, and so would resist the rise as it resisted the fall of the drop of rain. And (b) the direction of exchange of causal energy is not in- different to the whole, else we should expect to find, along with the infinite numbers of falling rain-drops, a reasonable number of cases in which fortuitous circumstances had led to the reverse performance. That such is not the case absolutely precludes the possibility that their direction is in any sense indifferent to the causal totality.</page><page sequence="12">372 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. III. Down to this point one important consideration has been neglected, viz., the bearing on the whole question of abstract mathematics. And this is the more important because of the fact that the boldest suggestions of cosmic reversal have generally had (as in the case of Laplace, Helmholtz, etc.) mathematical grounds. It would probably be more accurate to say that they have arisen in an atmosphere of mathematical suggestion, for- and this is the very point at present aimed at-it is difficult to see how, concretely and in detail, mathematical formulae could be made to lend much support to any such hypothesis. In the first place, and in any case, the mathematical equations must, in this connection, be regarded simply as symbolic expres- sions for the laws that determine mechanical action. Therein consists their relevancy and usefulness. That, too, is the basis of the assumption that a determinate mathematical result would always be paralleled by a determinate physical effect in the world of reality. And this limits at once the freedom and the range of speculation on the subject. We have just noticed, in the previous section, that the processes of nature could conceivably be reversed only if we were entirely at liberty to reverse the laws too, along with the direction of movement,-whatever such 'reversal' might mean. (Let one try, for instance, to write the 'reverse' of the law of gravitation that the attraction of two bodies for each other is f(mm'/d2). It might be (a) an attraction equal to f(d2/mm'); (b) a repulsion equal to f(d2/mm'); (c) a repulsion represented by f(mm'/d2); or (d) either an attraction or a repulsion equal to f(mm' X d2). Who can say on what mathematical or logical axis a law of nature should be turned in order to fit it to a temporarily inverted world? So long as the latter is a wholly hypothetical possibility, one may almost order one's quantitative statement of it to taste!) If, however, gravita- tion were replaced by some antithetical sort of repulsion, or the thermodynamic features of chemical reactions were altered, that could only mean, on the side of the mathematics (and this is the crux of the whole question), a changing of the character of the deter- mining equations themselves,-that is' to say, of the only definite basis we have on which the real past of a mechanical system</page><page sequence="13">No. 4.] ON COSMIC REVERSIBILITY. 373 could possibly be calculated. To assume a change in the rela- tionships, then, that compose the mechanical laws of motion and change, is to put even theoretically and mathematically out of reach the very facts that, on the basis of such mathematics and theory, we were trying to reinstate. This outcome would, of course, be enough to invalidate the whole suggestion of reversal. But difficulties multiply. If one were in possession of un- equivocal facts concerning space and time relationships, one might be able to state such facts in terms of arbitrary mathe- matical symbols. But to get back from the mathematical operations to reality is another matter and is beset with am- biguities. Suppose we had Laplace's much celebrated 'equation of the universe,' and suppose it to describe in an exact and quantitative way the series of states of the cosmos ABCDE, etc. in successive instants of time. And let C be chosen as the origin of coordinates where t = o. One could, of course, as- suming the continuity of the laws of change, infer what had been the state of affairs at the moment B. But that is only tantamount to saying that, in a universe that would in two more seconds become F, one is warranted in concluding that C is the outcome of an antecedent state B. Furthermore, or to say the same thing in other words, the B to which one calculates is explicitly one of such a character as would proceed to resolve itself necessarily into C, D, . . . and the rest of the series. A state B that would, instead, produce what had, under normal circumstances, been its predecessor (A) would simply not be the B which the equation for C allows us to calculate. Figuring backward to previous events in a progressive series of changes is so far from figuring forward in a regressive series of events, that the one absolutely precludes the other. The equation that shows exhaustively why B changes into C, thereby shows ex- haustively that it cannot change into a wholly different situation A. And, on the other hand, and for the same reasons, B can give rise to A only by subverting everything represented by such an equation and therefore the equation itself. That a rational meaning might, in any specific case, be given to any specific value of t in a mechanics equation, is not denied; the point is</page><page sequence="14">374 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. that our antecedent knowledge of the facts must determine both the notation and the interpretation thereof. It could not be used simply at large as the traditional speculation implies. The criticism, be it noted, is not of the mathematics, but of the assumptions with which the calculations deal. At least it is evident that, to calculate backward concerning a process is one thing; to imagine that such calculation is equiva- lent to the description of a backward movement on the part of the real process itself, is quite another. It even seems possible that the former totally excludes the latter. That is, there seem to be only two simple alternatives: to decide that the equations of mechanics, far from being indifferent to time direction, state such direction irremediably in their very structure; or to con- clude with Bergson that in the last analysis calculation deals only with space and simultaneities and does not in any wise grasp the flow of time. The present purpose, however, is to draw no ultimate conclusion of this nature; it is enough to have shown that the simple possibility of substituting a negative value for a positive one in a set of mathematical equations does not afford any proof that reversibility in time is a corollary of the mechanistic hypothesis. IV. There is just one other suggestion occasionally made with reference to real reversibility which, while it has not to do with mechanism as such, may with a certain propriety be mentioned in this connection. It is said that the essentially irreversible element in existence is time itself.' Just, in fact, as space may be taken to represent the multitudinous items in the world in so far as they are related in reversible series, time stands for that diameter of reality along which all series are irreversible; of this the futility of regret and the security of accomplished record are excellent witnesses. That we are un- able, as finite beings, to undo the past or arrest the flow of time, is obvious enough. But neither, for that matter, are we able to retard the spatial movements of the earth in its orbit; and it does not seem absurd to assume that the explanation might be similar in the two cases. Perhaps,, that is, the direction of 1 Cf. Royce, World and Individual, Vol. II, p. II4 ff.</page><page sequence="15">No. 4.] ON COSMIC REVERSIBILITY. 375 the time series is fixed for us because we are caught in some vast movement of Life which our most violent struggles are unable to swerve in the slightest degree; and at the same time such movement may be, from the standpoint of an absolute experience, as relative and contingent as any stellar drift in space. But these issues, too, are beyond the present search. The single point of interest now is to decide whether, in the contrast of the spatial and the temporal, lies the key to the idea of reversibility. It is first in order to notice whether, in the comparison as ordinarily made, the spatial and temporal series are taken on an equal footing. We have said that the spatial series is reversible while the temporal series is not. This means, let us suppose, that a real object may traverse a given part of space a second time, while a given period of time can be traversed but once. This is undoubtedly the ordinary meaning. However, it must be evident on a moment's thought that, in these two alternatives, spatial and temporal terms are thoroughly tangled. Suppose an object does traverse exactly the same space a second time; can it be said that one is dealing here only with a spatial series? What would a second 'time' have to do with a purely spatial series? On the contrary, is not time here the essential fact of the whole discussion? In which case we must state the proposed alternative as follows: A given series of points in space can be experienced a second time, while a given series of points in time cannot be experienced a second time. That is, a spatial-temporal series is compared with a temporal-temporal series, and it is no wonder that a difference of principle should be found to obtain between the two. One sets out to compare time with something else, and then states the proposition in such a way that time becomes the common denominator of both,-of itself and of the other series with which it is being compared. No final com- parison can be made on these terms. But perhaps there is another way to understand the whole contention. Suppose we say that 'direction' is the only thing referred to in this case. When it is said that the space series is reversible while the time series is not, the meaning then would be that an object can go in any direction in space while time</page><page sequence="16">376 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. XXVI. changes in only one direction,-from the past toward the future. But here again it is doubtful whether a spatial series is opposed to a temporal one in a simple and coordinate manner. Is 'direction' of movement any more a spatial than a temporal phenomenon even when the movement is what we ordinarily speak of as spatial movement and the direction, therefore, as supposedly a spatial one? Movement is a kind of change, and like any other change is a time function. Take any two points on the path of a moving body, and the direction of movement has to do simply with which of the two points was occupied first (i. e., in time!). It appears, then, that in place of a simple space series, we have on this side again a complicated space-time function. And the other alternative would, on this view of the problem, be little better off. What could one possibly mean anyhow by 'direction' of time? Of course we would be told that the expression is figurative merely; but is there any way to state the idea so that it would not be figurative? In any case, this elucidation of the problem will have to wait upon the interpretation of the metaphor. And the drift of it gives the unavoidable impression that here again we are failing to compare a space series with a simple and coordinate time series, and that is just what ought to be done if the distinction in question is to be maintained. It turns out then that whether reversibility be regarded (a) as a concrete physical process behaving in a manner precisely opposite to its custom; or (b) as a concept applying only to the ultimate hypothetical world of abstract physics; or (c) as a kind of objective analogue to the reading backward of a mathe- matical equation (which, Bergson is surely right in saying, has, as an equation, no direction at all); or (d) as a reversal of the time stream itself,-in every case the notion dissolves away into a sort of pseudo-mathematical dreaming. And the conclusion seems warranted that not only is purpose and final cause essentially unthinkable apart from its fixed time direction, but that efficient causality, in its temporal alignment, is equally fixed and unalterable. In other words, reversibility and causality are inherently antithetical and mutually contradictory conceptions.</page><page sequence="17">No. 4.1 ON COSMIC REVERSIBILITY. 377 The only kind of objective series that could be represented as reversible at all would be one entirely without internal coherence, a monument of absolute chance. If, conversely, there is any imaginable situation in which reversal could not possibly occur, it is in a series that is not only causally concatenated but bound together in a way that is statable in the quantitative equations of mechanism. Such a conclusion may very possibly be of interest in view of the fact that it was in connection with theories of mechanism that the concept of reversibility originally arose. BENJAMIN W. VAN RIPER.
