<plain_text><page sequence="1">PROMETHIUS BOUND OF AESCHYLUS' It hardly seems as if anything could have been left unsaid or unthought about the Prometheus of Aeschylus in all these centuries. And yet, in considering the problems which such a drama undoubtedly presents, our minds are often beclouded by inherited traditions and prejudices concerning the ancient Greeks and their literature. We know that some of these traditions originated long ago in very dull and narrow minds; but we still preserve them by a kind of perverted scholarship. It may be that with respect to the Prometheus we have all been influenced, more or less unconsciously, by such traditions and prejudices. Moreover, it is certainly a mistake to attempt to svnthesize, as many scholars are prone to do, all that the ancient Greeks have said on any subject, or even to interpret every saying of an ancient author by what the same author has said elsewhere. For ex- ample, it may be that the conception of Zeus pre- sented in the Prometheus is fundamentally different from the conception of Zeus in the Agamemnon. It is a dangerous practice also to interpret ancient literature as if it were modern. The danger lies in our natural tendency to project upon ancient times thoughts and feelings which are natural and common now, but which were alien to the ancient world, thereby ignoring the ideas and beliefs of the ancients which we have outgrown. On the other hand, it is equally dangerous to assume that the ancients thought and felt otherwise than we, especially if we hold, as we do, that among the ancient Greeks were some of the ablest minds which the human race has produced. This assumption would stretch every utterance of an ancient thinker upon the Procrustean bed of our traditional conception of the ancient world, and at the outset beg the question in the prosecution of any nonconformist. There is an idea, which is present in much of our modern thinking on matters of religion, that, as the human race advances, the religious views of the more enlightened and spiritually-minded tend to become more and more remote from those more primitive notions embodied in a traditional literature and mythology, or in the creed and ritual prescribed by an organized priesthood, and preserved essentially un- changed by the religious conservatism and super- stition of the masses. This may seem to some an essentially modern idea, and foreign to the ancient world. But it is certain at least that contemporaries of Aeschylus were convinced that the conceptions of the gods involved in their traditional literature and in popular belief were irreconcilable with what gods must be, if there are gods at all. It seems clear to me that Aeschylus also held this view. I do not mean merely that an interesting comparison may be drawn between the religious ideas of Aeschylus and our own; I mean that certain religious ideas similar to ours were consciously held by Aeschylus, and were deliberately 'This paper was read at the Fifteenth Annual Meeting of The Classical Association of the Atlantic States, held at Hunter College, April 23, 192I.</page><page sequence="2">OCTOBER 24, 1921] THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY 27 incorporated by him in this drama. If this is so, then we may properly seek to interpret this drama in ac- cordance with these idcas. The common interpretation of the Prometheus is that the poet took certain well-known myths, and with his artistic genius gave to them dramatic form. If these familiar stories are all this drama contains, there is no reason why anyone might not understand it completely, and doubtless this is all it did contain for the mass of Aeschylus's audience. These stories are presented in scenes which involve much that is the- atrical or spectacular, amounting sometimes to what we should expect in a modern melodrama. How the audience must have enjoyed seeing Might and Force drag in the struggling Prometheus and hold him to the cliff, while the reluctant Hephaestus pinioned him! How they must have wondered at the sea-maidens arriving in their winged car, or at old Oceanus with his dragon! How the horned Io and the account of her wanderings must have interested them! How they must have been thrilled by the awful cataclysm at the end! What might seem to us ridiculous in these spectacles was not so for those who believed that these supernatural beings really existed, and who were familiar from childhood with stories of such occurrences. Theatrical effects seem to me characteristic of Aeschy- lus's plays, and the chief reason for their notorious popularity. Processions and spectacular scenes crowd the stage in the Oresteia and the Seven Against Thebes. These were plays which everyone, how- ever unintelligent, could and did enjoy. And when we remember the extreme beauty of its verses, the sublime fortitude of its hero, and the pathos with which the innocent and pitiful Io is presented, we need not wonder at the success of the Prometheus. But surely this is not all that the Prometheus con- tains. Justly it has been called the most profoundly moving drama of all literature. Profundity is not necessarily involved in the legends selected, and it cannot be by accident that through his presentation of these legends the poet awakens in us the deepest thoughts concerning the existence and nature of divinity. That Aeschylus produced a play suited to the comprehension of a crowd is evident. That the same play had a deeper meaning for the more thought- ful in his audience is also possible. Some modern scholars, seeking such a deeper meaning, see in this, as in many other Greek tragedies, human character exhibited on a supernatural scale. Prickard, for example, sees in Prometheus a mythological figure like Oedipus, in whom a human character struggling under overwhelming injustice and suffering is pre- sented to view. But neither Prometheus nor Jo is an obviously human type; the human traits they display are incidental rather than essential to this drama. Others hold that Prometheus is the uncompromising champion of liberty, crushed in the conflict with autocracy, ultimately to arise triumphant. But Prometheus in this drama is the benefactor of the human race, not a champion in any sense; Io is the innocent victim of a ruthless tyranny. There is, however, another interpretation of this drama, which is at least more plausible. To many Prometheus is the heroic sinner, the rebel against the divine order of things-as-they-are, to which all should conform. Such persons hold that the essence of morality for the ancient Greeks was conformity to the transcendent rhythm of the universe, of which each individual is an integral part. From this point of view it was right and necessary that Prometheus should be 'rhythmized', that is, reduced, by torments if need be, to conformity. Thus they hold that Prometheus was for the Greeks a typically 'tragic' figure,. involved.by fate and circumstance in the hope- less antithesis of two resistless forces, in this case the passion for liberty and the duty of conformity; for us the balance is unequal and our sympathies are wholly with Prometheus, only because conformity to an organization of the universe which included the traditional Greek gods has ceased to be the ultimate morality. But this explanation is not complete, not wholly satisfactory. It fails to account for certain features of this drama which constantly recur, forcing themselves upon our attention. Why, for example, is the state- ment so often reiterated that the gods, against whom Prometheus rebelled, are new and transient, even though themselves contrasted with ephemeral men? Or why are these gods, with the possible exception of Hephaestus, represented throughout as so extremely and repulsively anthropomorphic, wanton and vile? Why are these two legends, in which the gods appear at their very worst, united here, although there is nothing in the traditional mythology which associated lo directly with Prometheus? Why is it that, al- though Oceanus, Io, Hermes, and even the sea- maidens urge Prometheus to submit and conform, their pleas are made so weak and unconvincing? They must have seemed unconvincing even to the ancient Greeks as we commonly imagine them. How is it, finally, that the last scenes of the play glorify Prometheus's uncompromising resistance on the ground that the existing authority will be ulti- mately dethroned or transformed? Of course Prometheus was a mythological figure, well known to all of Aeschylus's audience. And perhaps this was all he was to most. He is presented here in form more or less human, and with human characteristics. How else could he be presented on the Greek stage? Even such abstractions as Might and Force are presented here in human form. But, like many other mythological figures, Prometheus, as his name implies, is also a personification thinly veiled in the myth. Primarily it is the mythological figure which Aeschylus took as his hero, and con- formably with the practice of the Greek tragedians he introduces into his drama nothing which is contradic- tory to the accepted legends. Within the bounds of this convention, however, the myths and mythological figures are made the vehicles of his thought. Prometheus belonged to the ages of Uranus and of Cronus, as well as to this present age of Zeus. This</page><page sequence="3">28 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY [VOL. XV, No 4, WHOLE No. 400 drama does not explain how Uranus was overthrown, but we are told how the fall of Cronus came about. When the Titans undertook to defend Cronus, Prome- theus offered his services to them; their strength and his intelligence united would have sufficed perhaps to maintain the older order. But the Titans would have none of him; they chose to rely on force alone. Hence Prometheus, knowing that force without in- telligence could not succeed against deceit, joined Zeus, a willing ally to a willing lord; Zeus the de- ceitful, guided by intelligence, was better than blind force. By the intelligence of Prometheus Zeus was enabled to overthrow Cronus and all the old regime of heaven, making himself supreme. By reason of the power thus acquired through Prometheus's aid Zeus assigned to each of the lesser gods his special rights and functions. Yet later in the play Prometheus says that this also was done by him and not by Zeus: 'Who else but me did make complete assignment to these new gods of all their several functions?'. Once enthroned, this Zeus became autocratic, violent, and ruthless; he neglected, then sought to destroy utterly the present human race. But Prometheus with- stood him for the love he bore to man. He gave men hopes-blind hopes, it is true, but hopes that freed them from too anxious presage of an ultimate doom. He taught men all they know. Unthinking brutes before, he made them advance step by step through all the stages of their civilization. He gave them fire and taught its use, thereby making possible all those activities which depend on its employment. In short, as he says himself: 'All arts to mortals from Prometheus come'. Thus by Prometheus, and by him alone, there was provided for the race of men life which was comparable, in some respects at least, to that of the gods themselves. Because he withstood Zeus and befriended man, Prometheus incurred the enmity of this new ruler of the universe, and therefore he was transfixed and pinioned upon the lonely crag at the uttermost limits of the woIld. Yet he foreknew that unless he, the prisoner, saved the tyrant, the tyrant himself would in time be overthrown, in consequence of some act which he would perpetrate unless he was deterred. What that act would be is not fully explained; only it would be a marriage, one more last sexual anthro- pomorphic union among the gods. But this deliver- ance of Zeus would not be effected unless Prometheus was delivered from these bonds. His release would not be by the hand of Zeus. The liberator who would release Prometheus would be one born of woman, descendant of Epaphos, the son of Io, whom Zeus would engender, not sexually, but by touch alone. Therefoie Prometheus, though he suffered, would not submit to the tyranny of this upstart ruler, whom he himself had once enthroned. He knew that this ruler could not wholly destroy him, not though he heaped more torments, ten-fold more, upon his help- less head, and compassed the ruin of the earth and the sky in the outpourings of his wrath. Twice already Prometheus had seen such rulers of the universe swept from their seats of power. He would yet live to see the present tyrants in their turn dethroned, if they would not submit themselves to his guidance and restraint. The time would come when he would be released from bondage, and then, if fate willed it, would this Zeus turn once more to seek his love and league with him, as eager as he would be eager for this new alliance. What can this Prometheus be but reasoning, fore- seeing Intelligence, which alone bestows on gods and men alike their powers and their prerogatives? There even seems to be a clear hint of this interpretation in the opening scene of the play, where Cratus says to Prometheus: 'Falsely the gods call thee Intelligence; thou thyself dost need intelligence to get thee clear of this skillful work of ours'. But this Intelligence may be enthralled and tortured by the very gods whom he has himself enthroned, and then some one of the race of men must needs release him. Who are these gods, these new and transient gods, who appear in this strange drama? They are so vile! It was inherent in the legends of Prometheus and of Io that the gods involved therein should appear like men; but surely their anthropomorphism is here unnecessarily emphasized by Aeschylus. It seems as if the poet had tried in every way to make the gods appear as evil as possible. Not much is said about the other gods, but Zeus at least is vividly portrayed. He is arbitrary, irresponsible, violent, lustful, cruel, and ruthless. He is a tyrant. Yet we feel that he is a type of all the rest. Hera is lightly touched upon, but appears to be as human and cruel as her spouse. Hermes is truculent, servile, and ridiculous. He- phaestus alone appears reluctant to execute the cruel orders of his master. But all alike are enemies of Prometheus, and equally hated by him. They are hostile to the human race. Nearly the whole play is devoted to the display of the vindictive cruelty of these gods to Prometheus, whose only fault was that he befriended man, and to Io, whose only fault was that she was lovely. Are these the gods in whom Aeschylus believed? That he was a deeply religious man, and believed that gods really existed, is evident from his other dramas. But the Zeus oi the Prometheus is very different from that mighty, inscrutable deity of whom the chorus in the Agamemnon sings, who rules the world with jus- tice, and who, though he has set this law to be supreme for men, that 'Knowledge comes from suffering', has done this to promote righteousness in men, and not in wanton cruelty. The gods of the Prometheus are the gods of the traditional Greek mythology. They are not eternal. There have been other gods before them, and they themselves in turn will pass away. Real gods, if there be real gods, do not change; but men's conceptions of them change. The conceptions of the gods presented in the Prometheus are those which the Greeks of Aeschylus's time had inherited from a cruder and less spiritual age, embodied in their myths and sacred literature, and developed by the imagina-</page><page sequence="4">OCTOBER 24, 1921] THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY 29 tions of their poets and artists into characters as re- pulsive to the thoughtful Greeks of the fifth century before Christ as they are to us. Such gods as these are gods created by man in his own image and by him exalted until they enchain and torture the intelligence by which they were created, terrorize and disgust their creators. The intelligence by which they were created will survive them. But man alone can liberate the intelligence by which they may be reconstructed in accordance with man's own intellectual and spiritual development. For such gods have no objective reality; they exist only in men's minds. This play of Aeschylus is complete in itself. It matters little whether or not it was one of a trilogy treating a single subject, like the several chapters of a book. We know little, practically nothing, of the other plays which are commonly grouped with this. We do not know with certainty that they were grouped together by their author. It is not necessary that we should. The problem with which Aeschylus was dealing in this extant play is definitely presented to us. The same problem arises for every set of men who, having advanced beyond a more primitive stage of their development, seek to hold fast religious con- ceptions inherited from an earlier period, because these are incorporated in a literature which they con- sider sacred, and because all are reluctant to abandon or reconstruct their religious beliefs. The same problem faces the world to-day, and for the same reasons. We should not wonder, then, that Aeschylus in his time dealt with this problem in veiled language, and so cautiotusly that many in all these intervening centuries have failed to recognize, or at least to agree upon, his deeper meaning. Those who speak out plainly on such subjects are often held in great dishonor, and are thought by many to be doing incalculable harm. Such protestants have arisen in all ages; there are many of them now. But little good will come of all their argument until the time is ripe. Till then the wisest speak with caution, and try not to defeat their purpose by extreme state- ments which might destroy beliefs which many hold most dear, and which many would be unable to recon- struct or to replace.
