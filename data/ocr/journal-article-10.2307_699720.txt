<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Classical Review AUGUST-SEPTEMBER, 1918 ORIGINAL CONTRIBUTIONS EURIPIDES THE IDEALIST. DR. THOMSON in his. Euripides and the Attic Orators takes up a position, as regards the religious views of Euripides, which may be described as lying some- where between the positions maintained by Dr. Verrall and Professor Murray respectively. He sums it up in these words: ' There were thus three main periods in the development of Euripides' ideas relatively to religion-the first period, up to the beginning of the Peloponnesian War, when he acquiesced in the generally accepted beliefs; the second period, beginning with the Pelo- ponnesian War and lasting some twenty years, when he was at open enmity with these beliefs; and, finally, the period of his latest dramas, when, though he never returned to his original position, he came to look on his cam- paign as labour lost, and desisted from his attempt.'" It is the object of this paper to cast some light upon the subject ?of Euripides' religious views-and, incidentally, to explain how such en- tirely different ideas with regard to -them can have been maintairied as those which we associate with the names of Professor Murray and Dr. Verrall-by suggesting that it is wrong to attempt to define any such three clearly-marked periods in the development of the poet's thought, and that-even if there be any such periods-the first and the third of them are periods very different from those described by Dr. Thomson. That there is development in the religious thought of Euripides, as, indeed, there is in that of every great religious thinker, none will deny; the very discrepancy of interpretation which it has occasioned among different scholars is sufficient indication of the fact. But it is a development, and not a change amounting to a recantation at the end; it may be a development into something very different from what it began with-an acXXoloo-tsr, if you like -but it is not a t/peraoX'. Rightly regarded the Alcestis and the Medea- the two earliest plays-show us Euripi- des as a critic of the received religion from the very start. In the first of them Apollo rescues Admetus from the death to which he was doomed by deceiving the Fates2 and is expressly rebuked by Thanatos for this wrong done to the rights of the recognised powers that be,3 and in the second there is no lack of implied scepticism and doubt about the justice of the constituted order of things which finds explicit expression at least once: epvw roragw^v lepwv XwpooV 7ra-ay, KIca 6iKa Kat 7rdvra 7rdX v OrpETaL. dv6pd-t ' 66XtU at/3ovXalu , Oe&amp;)v 6' oUK9tL 7rLTTLr apfa peE. This criticism is not, of course, so violent as it is later to become; but it is there from the very outset, although implicit more often than explicit. We must not forget that Euripides was writing for the contemporary stage- indeed, actually competing for prizes to be allotted by a popular vote-and that he would naturally, as a new writer, feel his way very carefully at first, and try not to alienate his audience by an overt attack upon what they held sacred, 1 Eurz~iides and the Attic Orators, p. 38.

At any rate, it is rash to state that the Alcestis and Medea are the work of a poet who 'acquiesced in the generally accepted beliefs';1 and a careful reader will find no greater difference between them and the Iphi- genia Taurica or the Bacchae than he will find between the earlier and later work of a great modern artist-say between Thomas Hardy's Under the Greenwood Tree and his Tess of the D'Ubervilles. As Euripides gradually 'gained a footing' on the Athenian stage, and as his own inner life de- veloped, and he gained a clearer* and clearer conception of religious truths, his criticism of received religion became more outspoken and more violent. This attack has gained him the name of 'rationalist '; and we are forced to conclude that such a 'rationalist' could never have written that glorification of Dionysus represented by the Bacchae except as a palinode, by way of recan- tation, that is to say. But there is no such difficulty if we recognise that the rationalism of Euripides is only that rationalism which is a substratunm, as it were, of all idealism. All idealism is, of course, rationalistic in so far as it finds the sanctions for its morality internal, rather than based on external authority. Such rationalism-to those who cannot understand the personal idealism to which it leads-seems, in itself, akin to materialism. The attack upon received religion is regarded as purely destructive-as, indeed, an act of impiety; much in the same way as the tenets of a modern idealist, who does not believe in the account of the Creation given in Genesis, are regarded as impious by the conventional mind. It was just in this way that Aristo- phanes attacked Euripides; he found the conventional religion assailed, and either could not, or would not, follow Euripides to the higher ground of the personal religion which he wished to substitute for it. Let us admit that rationalism is not per se impious; it may lead and, indeed, with smaller minds, generally does lead, to some sort of materialism; but it is also the only route to idealism through a popularly- received religion. Now, there are in Euripides plenty of expressions of what we may call 'personal idealism '-but can we take them as expressions of the poet's own views? What about the danger of taking any saying of any dramatis persona as voicing the poet's personal feeling ? Decharme2 has pro- posed the application of two principles -that if an idea occurs several times in plays of different periods, especially if it seems to be one of which the poet was peculiarly fond, and that if the idea seems brought in for its own sake,. as it were, without any great relevancy- either to the dramatic situation or to the character of the speaker, then we may- conclude that such an idea is represen- tative of the poet's personal views. I propose a simpler test than this thorough-going and scientific mode of procedure. We may take as the per- sonal views of Euripides any remarks by a dramatispersona with whose attitude he has succeeded in making us sympathise. Indeed Decharme adds that another cri- terion is to be found in our knowledge of the character and situation of the dramnatis persona. Every work of art is designed as a whole; any 'message' which it may contain, any doctrine which it may strive to inculcate, will not be confined to this or that verbal expression, but will be part and parcel of the whole effect which the artist attempts by his work to produce upon the reader. If this or that play of Euripides has any effect upon us when we read it, inclines our sympathies either to this side or that, then we may take it that Euripides was enough of an artist to have intended that effect; and sentiments which are con- ducive to that effect, no matter by what ' dramatis persona' they may happen to be expressed, may rightly be taken as senti- ments expressing the personal views of Euripides. On this criterion we find a remarkable agreement-in views 1 Dr. Verrall's treatment of the Alcestis in his Eurihides the Rationalist is sufficient proof of this. 2 Eurzi5ide et l'Es~rit de son TkItire, p. 25 f.</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 91 about the gods, etc.-in the remarks of all' those dramatis personae for whom Euripides succeeds in winning our sympathies. Such remarks all tend to the discrediting of received religious views, but at the same time to the estab- lishing of a higher personal standard of morality, or of religion, than was ex- hibited by the received view; they ex- hibit that rationalism which is at the bottom, not of materialism, but of idealism; they will find the sanctions of right and wrong not in any external authority of a state-accepted religion, but in the bior-ts of man himself, in his own inner light.

Apart from such travesties, we see their true nature in their punishment of evil-doers," their hatred of violence,'0 and the victory of justice over injustice." From such passages we may conclude that Euripides himself, while disbeliev- ing in the anthropomorphic religion of the popular imagination, yet believed in some divine power manifested in the universe. Whatever this power is, it is not anthropomorphic; and it is both just and righteous.

Just as a base nature in the hey-day of youth, in all the glory of its arrogant strength, finds it easy to scoff at the gods, but-as Plato tells us-when the thought of death approaches, is tortured with fear lest there may be something after all in the stories about punishment in the next world, so a nobler nature will fearlessly follow the promptings of its ideal ct6a0s, even when those promptings lead to a rejection of commonly-received religious truth, so long as the confidence of strength is with it; but with advancing years it loses something of its confidence, and feels, more and more often, those doubts and questionings to which the 1 For the moment I exclude the Bacckae. a2 Orol ro T 8paOnv aL'TXpov, o VK e iO OEOL" Fr. 294.

There is one more point that I should like to add. It seems to me that the moraland religious teaching of Euripides is in conformity with that of contem- porary philosophical speculation as represented by Socrates and Plato. But he is said to be 'opposed to the dictum i ov'&amp;,'? EKCV Kcal/co.' If we mean by this that man has no moral responsi- bility for his vice, but is helpless in the hands of Jvdvcay, then, of course, Euripides is opposed to it; but if we mean by it what Socrates and Plato meant-that no man, who thoroughly understands what being IalcO implies, would voluntarily choose to become such-then Euripides is by no means opposed to it.
