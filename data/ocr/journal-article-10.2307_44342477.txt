<plain_text><page sequence="1">Billy Collins Picador Â£7.99 The blurb for Nine Horses tells the reader that "Billy Collins is one of the world's most popular poets" and it carries rapturous encomia from Carol Ann Duffy, John Updike, Michael Donaghy and other luminaries. Collins was appointed Poet Laureate of the United Sates for 2001-3 and is a Professor of English at Lehman College. If these commendations arouse expectations of poetic excellence, prepare to be disappointed. The poems in Nine Horses are good-natured, undemanding and sentimental. Formally they are uninteresting, monotonous and rhythmically inert, and almost without exception they are enfeebled by a kind of whimsical cuteness or infantile anthropomorphism. Here is the beginning of 'Aimless Love': This morning as I walked along the lakeshore, I fell in love with a wren and later in the day with a mouse the cat had dropped under the dining room table. The poet later refers to the dead mouse "in its light brown suit" and elsewhere we find stars "singing a song their mother/ sang when they were babies in the sky." Collins is not always as bad as this: in 'Christmas Sparrow' he gives quite a nice account of releasing a captive bird and 'Ignorance' and 'Obituaries' both avoid the mawkishness that disfigures so many of these poems. But in 'Paris', apart from the bird that he describes childishly as "yelling" at him "in French bird-talk" his image of "...the broad river undulating / like a long- playing record under the needle of my eye" seems to be inaccurate and clumsy like the kind of figurative language that less able students come up with in creative writing-classes. In 'Poetry' Collins writes: Let the playwright with the torn cardigan and a dog curled on the rug move the characters from the wings to the stage to face the many eyed darkness of the house. Poetry is no place for that. I don't think Shakespeare would have agreed with him but then, Shakespeare preferred to call himself 'William' rather than the prepubescent 'Billy' which Collins evidently feels happier with.
