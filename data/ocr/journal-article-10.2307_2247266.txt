<plain_text><page sequence="1">"THE GENESIS OF THE COGNITION OF PHYSICAL REALITY."' By JULIUS PIKLER. I had just completed an Essay, in which I had long been engaged, on " The Psychology of the Belief in Objective Exis- tence," when Mr. Stout's article, " On the Genesis of the Cog- nition of Physical Reality" appeared in the January number of MIND. The contents of that article were so diametrically opposed to my own views on the same subject that the only conclusion I could arrive at was that either Mr. Stout or I must be seriously wrong. Careful reflection only confirmed me in my own views. This has induced me to append to my Essay (which will soon be published in a small volume) some observations on Mr. Stout's article, and I desire to submit them first to the readers of MIND. Mr. Stout's Criticism on Mill.-I must begin with a brief survey of Mr. Stout's criticism on Mill's famous chapter, " The Psycho- logical Theory of the Belief in an External World ". The contents of half of his first paragraph may be summed up in the following sentence: " [Mill's] possibilities, so long as they are not realised, are nothing actual, i.e., nothing at all ". But this objection amounts only to a bare denial of Mill's doctrine. It is merely asserting of a thing that it is not white, when someone else maintains that it is. There are, in fact, two sorts of actualities: actual presentations and actual objective existence (or occur- rence). Possible presentations do not belong to the former class of actualities; the latter class of actualities, on the other hand, are said by Mill to be nothing else but possible presentations. Mr. Stout's statement therefore is simply a contradiction of what was maintained by Mill, and, as such, proves nothing. The same remark equally applies to his next objection. He says: " [Mill's] view may or may not be true; for our purpose it is sufficient to point out that it is dialmletrically opposed to the irresistible conviction of the ordinary mind. Mill's account of the material world may represent that world as it really is; but it certainly does not represent it as it normally appears to us." Now I, for my part, find nothing in my consciousness diametrically opposed to Mill's account. On the contrary, when, ignorant still of philosophy, I first heard these doctrines they appeared to rne as irresistibly true. No doubt, I had not arrived of myself at the forinulation of the doctrines-just as my teachers anticipated me in the matter of the axioms of mathematics; but I no less firmly believe in the one than in the other. This con- viction is shared by that larger portion of philosophers who are not realists. In their opinion as well as mine, men generally understand by the expression that a material thing somewhere</page><page sequence="2">"GENESIS OF THE COGNITION OF PHYSICAL REALITY." 395 exists, acts and changes, nothing else but that certain presen- tations are possible there. But Mr. Stout, in the same paragraph, goes farther. le says: "I think we have good reason for saying that it did not so appear even to Mill; for he speaks of changes taking place in the grouped possibilities. . . . . Now a change in a naked possibility is at the time when it is supposed to take place a change in nothing, and a change in nothing is no change at all. This could not be what Mill really meant, but only what he fancied himself to mean." If this were true, if Mill's formula did not cover the objective changes in things, if he contradicted himself, this might constitute a real argument against his theory. But, in point of fact, change occasions no greater difficulty to that theory than unchanged existence. By objective change Mill understands only the possibility of a _presentation of chanzge. Mr. Stout will not deny that there are presentations of change, and if this is true, then there are also possible presentations of change, or possibilities of such presentations of change quite as much as there are possibilities of presentations of things. The second paragraph of the criticism is, again, a simple nega- tion of Mill's theory, and may be passed over with that remark. The third paragraph points the following quotation from Kant against Mill:-" The apprehension of the manifold in the phenomenal appearance of a house that stands before me is suc- cessive. The question then arises, whether the manifold of the house itself be successive, which, of course, no one would admit." This objection can be easily disposed of. That the different parts of the house are coexistent does not mean, according to Mill's theory, that there is a possibility of perceiving them simultaneously, but it means that there are a number of different simultaneous possibilities of presentations, from amongst which the individual may select any at will. Our belief that there is a world consisting of coexisting things means, according to this theory, nothing else but our belief that the possibility of selection from amongst many different presentations subsists for us at any moment. All the arguments of Mr. Stout are therefore of no avail against Mill. Mental. Activity ancd Not-Self.-The following quotation gives what Mr. Stout regards as the most essential part of his own theory: " Apart from operation of extraneous conditions, the redistribution of attention normally takes place in such a manner that the focussed pre- sentation A gradually a-nd continuously disappears and gives place to a nascent presentation B .... . In all these changes the transference of attention is orderly and continuous s..... But this orderly redistribution of mental activity determined by interest and preformed associations, is perpetually modified and colntrolled by interfering conditions ... . As I sit absorbed in study, I am rudely interrupted by the soiinds from a barrel-organ in the street.</page><page sequence="3">396 J. PIKLER: . . . In so far as the mind becomnes in this manner definitely aware of the limitations and interruption of its own activity, it finds itself confronted by a problem, which it can solve only by reference to an activity other than its own. . . . This seems to me to be an indispensable moment in the development of the perception of physical reality. The antithesis of mnental activity and passivity, when it becomes sufficiently definite, enables and compels the individual to posit some agency separate from, and independent of, his own private experience." To this theory there are opposed three facts, each of them sufficient, singly, to refute it. The first is that, apart from exceptional efforts, the feeling, sensation or presentation of mental activity is but a very faint and indistinct presentation, at all events so faint and in- distinct that the interruption of its orderly redistribution by the occurrence of " interfering conditions " cannot induce the indi- vidual to attribute these external conditions to another activity which he would conceive to be modelled after the former. On this point I appeal to general consciousness. Some readers may have had a contrary individual experience with regard to the intensity and distinctness of that presentation. But that it holds good with the majority of mankind is proved by the circumstance that that presentation or feeling, as conceived by Mr. Stout's theory, is only a discovery of a few, more modern, psychologists. Earlier psychologists speak of activity of mind, but they know nothing of any such feelings of it. The belief in the objective existence of the external world is nearly fully developed in the child as soon as it begins to employ coherent sentences in speaking. According to Mr. Stout the child at that age must have got beyond this observation, generalisation and inference: 'An agency operates within me in orderly and normal fashion. It is sometimes inter- rupted. When this happens it is the effect of an external agency.' Mr. Stout thus supposes the child to be invested with a capacity for self-observation superior to, and more precise than, that actually betrayed (in Mr. Stout's opinion) by the large majority of the professional psychologists of all ages. This cannot be correct. In point of fact such observation and generalisation cannot really be performed by the child. The second fact is that the feeling of what Mr. Stout calls the interruption of activity, is likewise so indistinct that it cannot produce the result attributed to it. But this will be more apparelnt in establishing the third fact. This third fact constitutes the strongest argument against Mr. Stout. It consists, on the one hand, in this that the so-called interruptions take place not only in consequence of present- ations of things and occurrences of the external world, but also through subjective presentations. There is no process of reflec- tion so4 regular -as to be exempt from being "interrupted" by 3udden flashes of thought. Interruptions are likewise caused by</page><page sequence="4">"GENESIS OF THE COGNITION OF PHYSICAL REALITY." 397 sudden cravings, by unaccountable good humour or depression, by impatience, by memories, by hunger, thirst, sleepiness, fatigue, or bodily ailments. On the other hand, presentations of external things and events appear and follow each other-oftener through our own activity and movements than of themselves-in just as regular succession as the thoughts during uninterrupted re- flection. Our motor activity greatly resembles mental activity in its stricter sense. Every kind of presentation therefore may appear and disappear in both a gradual and orderly manner (as a consequence of our own activity) and an interruptive manner. The pretended " fundamental and pervading incoherence within the sphere of individual experience " therefore, unfortunately for Mr. Stout's theory, does not coincide with the division between thing-presentations and subjective presentations, and hence cannot be identical with it. The objects that come into the way of mental activity and must be worked up by it, are presentations in general, subjective as well as presentations of things,-objects in Locke's sense and not only the objects of the external world. Anthropomorphic conception of Thing-presentations. But the above "indispensable moment," is, according to Mr. Stout, "only one step, although a most important one, towards the solution of the problem before us ". Farther- " It is necessary to show how the contents of tactile, visual and other presentations in all their concrete variety come to be apprehended as existing independently of individual thought and perception . . . The mode in which this takes place is in general as follows. Certain changes within the field of consciousness are uniformly attendant upon our own motor activity. Similar changes also take place of themselves apart from any action of ours. In order to make our experience self-con- sistent we are constrained .... to regard these variations as due to something not ourselves exercising a motor activity analogous to our own." Mr. Stout, throughout, describes the child as continually busy propounding anthropomorphic hypotheses concerning his thing- presentations. Although I know that not only Mr. Stout but almost all of the more modern realists would like to imake us believe this fact, yet I decline to do so unless other proofs are adduced in its favour than the mer6 assertion that the child is " compelled," " impelled," or " constrained " to go through this sort of mental activity. Moreover, weighty proofs speak against it. When we are grown up we have no anthropomorphic conceptions of this kind. We do not conceive inanimate things as making- efforts and possessing activity similar to our own (for it is. precisely on this account that we distinguish them from animate beings), and not one of us can remember a change of his ideas in this respect. It is equally certain that one of the first distinctions we make is that between things animate and inanimate. We never see inanimate things ,moving towards us, unless they are carried by an animate being, or wind, or water. The primitive</page><page sequence="5">398 J. PIKLER : man anthropomorphises the wind; whether he does water, too, I am not aware. Animate beings are conceived by every individual, at a very early stage, as possessing internal activity similar to his own, but there is no necessity whatever, nay everything speaks against it, for his also investing with such an activity things moved only by animnate beings. But, granting the child's anthropomorphic mode of thinking, I fail still to perceive its bearing on the problem in hand. Evens if Mr. Stout's description of the child's manner of thinking were entirely true, the only objectively existing thing which the child so far gets to know would be the agency supposed; for that behind which the child supposes the agency to be consists of his presentations, and so far the child had no reason whatever to suppose that these colours, sounds, &amp;c., continue to remain after they have cease&amp; to be present to him. The anthropomorphisin of primitive man is, too, of such a nature that with every indi- vidual it must be unavoidablly preceded by the belief in the Objective existence of things. Persistence. Hlow does it come that we believe things to persist when they are not before us? According to Hume and Mill this is what is first developed, and furnishes the ground for believing that our actual thing-presentations are presentations of objec- tively existing things. Accordinlg to Mr. Stout, the process of development is just the reverse: it is through the supposition of external agency that we first of all obtain the conception of our thing-presentations as independent presentations, and only by this means do we afterwards arrive at the belief in their persist- ence. The step (truly all-important and indispensable) takes place in the following manner: " We saw in ? 5 how the individual is constrained to posit some agency beyond the range of his own private experience . . . There thus arises a well-marked division between self and its modes on the one hand, and the not-self and its modes on the other. The not-self must, by the con- ditions of its psychological genesis, be presented from the ouitset as that which changes or remrains unchanged independently of this or that mode of motor activity on the part of the percipient. Hence variations in the content of perception, if and so far as they are traced to the motor activity of the percipient, are presented as changes in the self, i.e., in the body-cormplex, not in the external object. In the midst of such variations this object may remain unchanged . . . So far as resisted effort is followed by change in the content of sense-perception, we are constrained to refer the change, as such, to our own exertion; on the other hand, so far as the change is only partial, i.e., so far as the resisting thing persists unchanged, we are constrained to interpret its persistence as uniformly connected with the kind and degree of the counter-effort, which we represent as distiiict from our own. The experience of resist- ance is also an experience of persistence . . . All resistance is resistance to change . . . and in the normal cou'rse of human experience, the individual percipient is constrained to apprehend it as such." This process of inference, as described by Mr. Stout, must have</page><page sequence="6">"GENESIS OF THE COaNITION OF PHYSICAL REALITY." 399 surprised every reader. It is attributed by him to a child under three years of age! Surely, it is not at all right to ascribe such reasoning to the child, when the origin of the belief in objective existence can be shown to have arisen by means of such simple induction as may be seen constantly practised by grown-up persons. Let us place by the side of each other the two accounts of the process of thought of the child under three years of age, and of how it may be supposed to learn to speak. According to Mr. Stout: I feel a mental activity within -me. It operates now regularly, now again it is interrupted by the appearance of certain presenta- tions (coloured surfaces, sounds, smells). These interruptions canntot be but consequences of another agency Similar to mine. These presenta- tions, move, resist, &amp;c., like my body; these facts, too, necessarily must be preceded by efforts similar to those of the agency I am accus- tomed to feel within me. These presentations are called by my parents, clock, dog, &amp;c., or things. Pointing at these things they are in the habit of telling one the other that they are there. By this my parents mqean that ant agency, independent of the agency within me, operates wvithin these things. Those presentations change in consequence of my activity. They resist my motor efforts. All resis- tance is resistance to change; it is persistence. Hence those pre- sentations have not the tendency to change by themselves. Their changes belong to the history of my agency and not to that of their agency. There is no reason for me to suppose 'that these presenta- tions appear and disappear of themselves, as often as they appear before me or cease to be present. I therefore believe that they (the things) remain, persist, exist even after they cease to be present to me. According to Mill: I am sitting. I see before me different coloured suLrfaces which are called by my parents walls, pictures, clock. If I put out my hand I touch a suirface which is called a table by my parents. In a word, all these surfaces are called things by my parents. I hear sounids of which my parents speak in this way, ' The watch is tick- ing'. I see through the window sometimes a clear sky, and clouds at other times. My parents say ' The weather changes'. If I take a piece of chalk between my fingers and draw it along the table I see that there is a white spot left; if I pass over the table with my fingers alone I see that there is no spot left. In the former case, my parents say that the chalk pro- duces a spot. If I turn my head away I no longer see the same surfaces, but I see the wardrobe, &amp;c. ; if I turn my head back I again see the former surfaces. I have similar experiences if I stretch out my arm in another direction and place it again on the table. If I rise and go away out of the room into the next room, as they say, I see again other things, experience other changes and actions, and hear other sounds. I perceive yet other things, changes, actions, and hear other sounds if I leave the room and go into the yard. I experience the same things when I return to the second room and then to the first which I expe- rienced there before. Whenever I took this walk, the consequences</page><page sequence="7">400 J. PIKLER: "GENESIS OF THE COGNITION OF, ETC." were the same. I believe that this will be always so. My parents when they sit near me in the first room always say that there are certain things in the next room and in the yard, (namely, the same which I can see there). By this they mean that certain surfaces can be seen there, &amp;c. They further say that certain events (changes) happen there (namely, those that can be per- ceived there); that one thing pro- duces on another thing (namely, which I can observe being there near it) a change (namely; that which happens to the other thing and which could not happen to it if the first thing were not there). By this that something is there, that something hcappens there, my parents therefore mean that something can be perceived there, and by this that one thtng produces a change (acts) on another thing, they mean that a change might be observed there on the latter thing which could not be observed if the first thing could not be perceived there. What I therefore believe, I, too, must state briefly thus, that there are certain things in the next room and that certain changes and actions take place there. If we reflect that of these two processes of thought the one Mr. Stout ascribes to the child consists of a number of bold realistic hypotheses, capable of no proof, while that ascribed to it by Mill involves the most ordinary inductions necessary to life, we may well feel disposed to accept Mill's theory rather than that of Mr. Stout, and to express our conviction that after all we are more indebted for our belief in an external world to the regularity than to the irregularity of our sense-experience.
