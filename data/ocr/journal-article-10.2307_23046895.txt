Pp. xiii, 201; maps, charts, photographs, bibliography, index. $99.95. Written a quarter of a century after receiving her Ph.D. in the history of art, Monica Blackmun Visona's "Constructing African Art Histories for the Lagoons of Cote d'lvoire," combines the high energy of early research that included extensive work in Africa with a mature reflection based on years spent teaching, writing, and continuing research during a time when the theoretical frameworks for topics in African studies and art history were changing. The result is a palimpsest of a book, with intersecting layers of experience and theory providing a multi-textured view of the arts, the author herself, and change especially in the way we understand "art" since what we carry to Africa in our cultural baggage has changed, or in today's terminology, our paradigms have shifted. In Visona's exploration of the artworks of the Lagoon cultures, she not only takes the time to reflect upon the validity of western art historical discourse to frame the study of the art of other cultures, but also provides a review of the scholarly work critiquing this approach and a trenchant synopsis of the arguments. She then looks at the way multiple disciplines (geography, linguistics, history, archaeology, anthropology, and such spin-offs as visual culture) have intersected in her own work. She goes on to describe her research methods—the review of the literature and archival material, discussions with art merchants and collectors, and field work—and then to deconstruct them, observing errors made, paths not taken, and new perspectives. In the body of the book, Visona addresses first the figural sculpture that attracted her to this area, then arts of leadership and prestige (incorporating commentary on theories of wealth and commodification), and finally the richness of age-set festivals seen through the lens of Performance Studies. A final chapter addresses the ironies surrounding the parallels linking the reception of late nineteenth century and early twentieth century African art works in the West to the reception of European art by Africans as well as how this has evolved in the postmodern moment—with the dramatic and voluptuous female statuary of Emile Guebehi as a case study.</page><page sequence="2">356 UAHS Vol. 44, No. 2 (2011) Book Reviews Looking at the figures that have been documented in Western collections since the late nineteenth century, Visona notes that local artists and patrons experience them quite differently from Western connoisseurs, resulting in distinctive historical narratives. The former engage with the statuary as part of their religious practice; the latter respond to them on the basis of aesthetic impact and style. After contextualizing the objects both culturally and historically, no small task given the variation across lagunaire cultures, Visona constructs a Lagoon corpus through a painstaking analysis of form based on sculpture that has been widely dispersed, found variously in collections abroad, in the hands of local diviners and practitioners, and, some, only illustrated in the literature. She describes this section of the book as a rudimentary catalogue raisonne that begins to draw together information taken for granted in the study of Western art. She delineates nine styles that are loosely linked to geographic zones but not particular ethnicities, six named artists, and many more whose styles were distinctive and resulted in such names as "Master of the Long Nose" (p. 74). Visona's comments on how this approach could be criticized within today's art historical frameworks are telling. She suggests that the processes of creating a catalogue raisonne—teasing out biographies for individual art works, tracing origins, counting the number of works assigned to a single hand, assigning a general location to an artist or workshop—are all familiar territory to art historians working with past cultures. As such, they represent an approach somewhat out of fashion in many well-studied world art traditions. Visona has used it, however, to frame the Lagoon works as "cultural heritage"—objects worthy of contemplation by Africans and non-Africans alike. This is but one of the art histories suggested by her title. Other art histories would be to reconstruct the viewing practice or "gaze" existing within the culture with regard to these objects; to open the debate to include the complex installations and performances created by diviners, rather than privileging the anthropomorphic sculpture; to interrogate more closely the notions of beauty, sexuality, and femininity that Lagoon owners applied to clearly gendered figures and spirit beings. Such extensions of her analysis suggesting alternative art histories enrich each section of the book. If I have any criticism, it would focus on the illustrations (not enough of them and none in living color, though they are good, clear black and white images). The book has great value as the first comprehensive study of the arts of the Lagoon peoples. It also stands out as an important review of the limitations of post-structuralist (postmodern) theory, at least in the context of studying the visual arts in Africa. The author's manifest honesty, impeccable scholarship, and clarity of prose recommend it to scholars and students alike. JEAN M. BORGATTI Clark University</page></plain_text>
