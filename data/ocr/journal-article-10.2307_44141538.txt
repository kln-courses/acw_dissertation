<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CULT OF MÂNASA IN BENGAL Pmnabanandc J ash {Santini keian) 1.1 Goddess Manasa1 or the Serpent deity is still regarded as an object of popular worship in Bengal and its neighbouring regions. Like other folk deities, viz. Sitala, Shashthi, etc, she was originally worshipped by primitive peoples but gradully found a place in the orthodox pan- theon of Hinduism. It is only in the later Puranas like the Padma , Devi Bhagavata , Brahma Vaivarta , etc. that the name Manasa as the serpent goddess is found.8 1 .2 Although the prevalence of Naga worship can be traced from tht remote past, i. e. at least from the Indus valley Civisation, no referene« is to be found anywhere of any important female serpent character right from the beginning of the Vedic times3 down to the time of the early Buddhist literature. Of course, it is admitted that the Mahabharata speaks of the name of Jaratkaru, sister of Vasuki, and contains a detailed account of her, but her existence ceases to exist after the birth of her son, Astika. Elsewhere in the same epic4 the Nagas, the offspring of the poisonous snakes, are said to have been born from Kasyapa by Kadru who is described as the mother of all the snakes. In the Ramar yanas, it is Surasa who is said to be the mother of the snakes. But n« divinity was attributed to them. 1.3 The wide distribution of the Naga figures belonging to differeat periods all over India suggests the esteem and popularity in which th« Nagas were held and also indicates the prevalence of the Naga worship. They are still being worshipped on the day of Naga-pancami falling om the fifth day of the ascending node oí the moon in the month of Sravana (July- August) every year,6 when offerings of milk and parched grain« {lava) are made to them. In Bengal and its adjoining regions a special worship is performed on this occasion in honour of the snake goddest Manasa. These performances of the present times may well be regarded</page><page sequence="2">170 as the fitting counterpart of the sarpabali of the Grhya-sutras , the perfor- mance of which annual rite lasted for the four rainy months.7 1.4 It may be noted here that the dominant position of the serpent goddess in this region is possibly due to the strong-hold of non Aryan cultural influences. A. Bhattacharyya thus observes : "The eastern provinces of India and the peninsula of the Deccan are the places where Aryan influence could not spread so effectively. Hence it is this part of India that possess some of the pre-Aryan cultural cearacteristics. Sakti worship or the worship of the goddess power of some specific nature is one of them. This is why in no other place in India except Bengal, some parts of Bihar and Assam and the South can the worship of the anthropomorphic serpent goddess be met with. In all places subject to the direct influence of Aryan culture the serpent too is worshipped but as Naga-raja or the king of serpents who is obviously a male deity."8 1.5 A closs scrutiny of the worship of Manasa, also known as Visha hari, in the present day reveals its strong association with the non- Aryan mother goddess worship of India. In fact, the worship of Manasa is prevalent all over Bengal especially the rural Bengal and neighbouring regions among the people of the lower stratum of the society like the Dom, Bauri, Keot, Mai, Bagdi, etc., mostly hinduised aboriginals. There is hardly any village in the district of Birbhum where the worship of Manasadevi is not performed. In some parts of the district of Burdwan the higher caste Hindus observe arandhana or abstinence from cooking on the Naga-pancami day and place a few leaves of milky hedge plants inside the oven in order to worship the deity. An account of the worship of the goddess Manasa in the district of Burdwan was given by Risely a nearly a century earlier. The- deity is believed to be the serpent goddess and is primarily worshipped to get rid of snake bites during the rainy season. She is also worshipped for other purposes, like, to cure chronic diseases and to get a child showing the association of the deity with fertility cult.9 She is accredited with occasional violent anger manifested in snake-bite and other curses as depicted in the medieval Manasa-mangal Kavyas. The rites and rituals relating to the worship of Manasa have variations in different parts of Bengal, but the basic elements are almost the same and identical.</page><page sequence="3">171 1 6 The deity is worshipped in some places regularly in a permanent shrine or she is offered annual/occasional worship particularly during the rainy season. Shrines are like the temples made with mud walls and covered with straws, commonly known as Manasa-badi (house of Manasa). The images in these shrines are the painted earthen pitchers, usually odd numbered, with a representation of the hooded snakes. In some villages there is no such temple but an uncovered altar on which there isa Manasa or Sija Manasa ( Euphobia Lingularia) which is regar- ded as the deity.10 This place is known as Manasa-tala (abode of Manasa). Both these places are considered for performing annual or occasional worship of the deity. 1.7 Although, the worship of the deity on the Naga-pancami day is prescribed in the Smriti scriptures yet in shis region different other practices relating to the performance of worship are also to be found. While on the last day of the Bengali month of Sravana the goddess is worshipped in the eastern part of Bengal (Bangaladesh), in West Bengal, according to practice obtaining in various villages it is cetebrated on the first or the last day of the Bengali month of Bhadra or on any Saturday or Tuesday of the same month or on every fifth day dating from the Naga-pancami in the month of Ashadha and Sravano or on the Dasahara day when the river Ganges is worshipped.11 Besides, the deity is also worshipped in the Manasa-tala or Manasa-sthana on any day in the rainy season or other seasons as decided by the villagers. 1.8 The deity is worshipped with flowers, incense, unboiled milk, ripe plantain, vermilion, etc. Animal sacrifices are not unknown. Pig, goats, pigeons, etc. are offered to the deity in some places especially when a vow is taken by a person and the desire is fulfilled. Sometimes a stone piece or a brick is tied with a thread by the side of the Manasa tree or by the side of the shrine when a vow is taken. After the fulfillment of the vow the worship of the deity is performed by observing all the rites and rituals. The Brahma Vaivarta Parana ordains that those who wor- ship the goddess Manasa with vali (sacrifice) and other objects on the Pancami-tithi , will obtain wealth, fame and child : Pancamyam Manasakhyayam devyai dadyacca yo valim12 Dhanavan putravamsaiva kirtiman sa bhaved dhruvam13 There are some minor variations pertaining to the performance of worship of the goddess in different places and regions but there is no</page><page sequence="4">m difference of opinion about the non Aryan female character of the deity. ïhe deity did not initially find any place in the orthodox Brahmanical religious systems, although various attempts have been later on mad* to equate her with the Vedic goddesses, like Sarasvati, Lafcshmi, etc.12 1.9 Definite divine charcter of the serpent goddess alongwith th» Nagas is revealed possibly for the first time in the archaeological object» discovered from Rajģir (Bihar) as early as the beginning of the Christian era. The excavations of the mound at the site of Maniyar Math 14 which disclosed the remains of a curious cylindrical structure of a shrin® dedicated to the worship of Mani Naga. It contained well preserved figures out of which five represented Nagas and one Nagini (female ser- pent). All the figures have been found portrayed as human beings* standing, two-armed, held different positions and are provided with the usual snake-hoods, varying in number from five to one. In course of his analysis of these antiquities, Bloch suggested that "it was a kind of pantheon (?) where serpant deities were worshipped and that serpent Worship must have been the popular religion of the local inhabitants. Bloch also suggested that, 'one of the Naga figures might probably b* that of Manikara or Mani Naga, named in the Mahabharata as th» protector of Rajagriha, whose favour people invoked for rain ' An inscription discovered on a red sand stone sculpture and engraved in characters of the 2nd century A.D. brings out the name of Mani Naga whose favour is referred to apparently as being conducive for the donor. The sculpture in question was found in various fragment* during the last five years and when pieced together was found to reveal a row of Nagas with snake-hoods on the head and several female figures or Naginis one of which has the inscription Bhagini Sumasadhi or sisteť Sumagadhi. From her name Bhagani Sumagadhi appears to have bee* a protecting deity of ancient Magadha. The finds afford a glimpse int» the popular religion of the ancient people of Rajgir, and show that the snake deities, both male and female, were worshipped particularly for bringing id the much needed rains, the association of snakes with rain being probably due to the fact that the snakes are more in evidence during the rainy season than at any other time of the year."tó 1.10 Before studying the sculptural representations which are generallv Assigned to the eleventh-twelfth centuries A. D. onwards we may men»'</page><page sequence="5">173 tion here that according to some scholars Mahayana or the Tantritf Buddhist School of Eastern India witnessed the worship of the serpent goddess in the name of languii. It is believed that Buddha taught some of his chief disciples the mystical formula of the worship of this goddess.18 The Sadhanamala informs us that "The Hindu Manasa or Visahari has a marked resemblance to the appearance of Janguli, and some of the meditative verses in the Hindu Tantric works for the goddess distinctly give her the epithet of Janguli."17 In the description of the images there are also conspicuous resemblances which also lead to believe that- "the influence of Mahayana Buddhism continued almost till the times of the Pala kings in Bengal. Therefore, there is sufficient reason to believe that the worship of this most ancient anthropomorphic serpent-goddess Janguli was widely prevalent in Bengal up to that time. When with the decline of the Pala kingdom there was a revival of Brahmanism in the hands of the Sena kings many Buddhist priests left this country for Nepal where Mahayana Buddhism was still very popu- lar, but those who stayed on preferred to introduce their gods and goddesses in new names so as to avoid any suspicion of their Buddhist affiliation. It seems that the name Janguli for the snake -goddess was dropped at that time and a new name Manasa was taken instead."1» The Jains regard Padmavati as the serpent goddess. A.K. Bhattacharyya has discussed this issue in a paper entitled «Tara as a Serpent Deity and its Jaina Counterpart Padmavati.'19 1. 11 While dealing with the origin of the name of goddess Manasa, Acharya Kshitimohan Sen points out that the serpent goddess Mane Maneamma of the Canarese country is a source of the Bengali snake- goddess Manasa.2* The earlier Sena kings who hailed from this region possibly carried the tradition of Mane Maneamma to Bengal. In fact, there are many other views relating to the origin of the name of goddess Minasa,21 but there is no denying the fact that the present from of the deity originates not earlier thin the eleventh-twelfth centuries A. D. 1.12 A large number of sculptural representations of the deity have been found from different places of Bengal and its adjoining states. The general type of the stone image of Manasa has been described thus : "The deity is seated on a lotus in the hlitasana pose, with hoods of seven snakes spread over her head, her left hand holding the eighth one</page><page sequence="6">174 (mythologically, eight nagas are associated with the goddess). Her right hand in the varada pose holds a fruit, and she is attended on either side by a seated emaciated figure and and a crowned male person."22 A beautiful bronze figure of Manasa, probably belonging to the Pala period, is now in the Indian Musenm, Calcutta. "It shows the goddess seated under the usual snake-hoods in the lolitasana ; pose, with a child on her left lap and her right hand holding a long leafy branch."23 1.13 Two images of Manasa, one from Paikor and the other from Bhadiswar in the district of Birbhum have deen discovered.*4 One of the images found from Paikor bears an inscription [ - rajena Sri Vijaya Se (nena) showing that the image belongs to the time of Vijaya Sena of the Sena dynasty.25 It is carved on a stone pillar. The image is two armed and seated on a blooming lotus; part of the head is broken; on the right side of the image there is a small male figure, probably that of the sage Jaratkaru, the right hand is placed on the right knee; the left hand holds a serpent.26 The second image does not bear any ins- cription but from the stylistic point of view it may be placed with that of the image discovered at Paikor. The image is well preserved. Seven serpents are found spreading their hoods over the head of the goddess. Her left hand holds a snake, her breasts are covered with bodice of snakes; on one side is a female attendant, on the other a male figure like the one discovered at Paikor, possibly the sage Jaratkaru. The goddess is seated on a blooming lotus in lalitasana pose. Her limbs are adorned with beautiful ornaments. Below the seat is a worship pot (ghata) upon which her feet are placed. 1.14 Innumerable images of the deity have been discovered from diffe- rent places of Bengal and adjoining regions and they are now housed in tee Indian Museum, Calcutta; in the museums of Dacca and Varendra Research Society of Rajshahi in Bangladesh.28 Almost all the images are assigned not earlier than eleventh-twelfth centuries A. D.29 and by that time the conception of the anthropomorphic serpent-goddess with Brahmanical attributes found expression in the sculptural representa- tions. Thus from this time onwards goddess Manasa is being worshipped by all sections of Hindu society. In the concept of the present day Manasa goddess an amalgamation of Brahmanical deities (like Sarasvati,</page><page sequence="7">175 Lakshmi, etc.), Buddhist Ja Dguli-tara and Jaina Padmavati is distinctly manifested. A synthesis of both Brahmanical and non-Brahman ical elements is discernable and it is very much in vogue even in the prac- tices of rites and rituals as well as in sculptural representations. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1 The word Mjnasa in ths sense of a d 3ity is absent in the early Sanskrit texts. The Ashtadhyayi of Panini and even the lexion of Amara did not mention the name of Manasa. Soms scholars believe that Sanskrit manas means mind; so in the word manasa the suffix of inîtrumental has been added to give the sense of «by mind'. According to the later lexicographers - by manasa is meant the goddess who has been created 'by mind* or contemplation by Kasyapa. Sukumar Sen Vipradasa's Manasa Vijaya , Asiatic Society, Introduction, p. xxx thinks that "Mahamanas as an epithet of the victorious gods occurs in the Rv. 10.103.9 Manasa as the name of a celestial nymph is not unknown in Sanskrit literature. The name is obviously connected with manas 'mind', and it does not exclude other connotations of the verb mart 'think*. H. Bhattacharyya Hinduder Devadevi : Udbhava O Krama-Vikasa , vol. Ill, Calcutta, 1980, p. 152 says that the expression * Atisprdhah samaryata Manasa Suryahkavih * {Rig. 5/44/7) shows the prevalence of the name Manasa (here represented as the wife of Surya or as the ray of Surya). 2 Besides some stray references in the earlier religious scriptures there are series of literary works of the Mangala-kavyas in Bengali literature in which Manasa- Mangala is very important and exhaustive one, depicting the worship and lier positive potentiality. 3 The Aitareya Brahmano (23. 298) speaks of the word Sarpa-rajni , but the term here means the earth and not the queen of serpents, M.
