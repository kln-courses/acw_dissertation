<plain_text><page sequence="1">The The Metaphysics of Evolution, with other Essays, by T. Whittaker. (London, Williams &amp; Norgate, Ltd., 1926.) Τ his is a book of considerable size, containing two series of essays on philosophical questions and the history of philosophy. The philo sophers to whom essays are devoted, Erigena, Bruno, &amp;c., are those representative of the writer's way of thinking, or, in the case of Renouvier who receives some attention, influential in modifying the metaphysical and ethical ideas that are expounded in the last part of the work. In the preface is indicated the connecting thread by which articles on seemingly heterogeneous topics, and even reviews of books, are strung together into a series which, as a whole, has one tendency. As most of the essays have been published before, and the one that figures in the title of the collection is the climax of the series, this alone may here be singled out for notice. Mr Whittaker advocates an ontology based on science and idealism or what he sometimes calls phenomenism. It is not put forward as dogma, but is confessed to contain imaginative or hypothetical elements. One can agree with the author that ' for further progress the modern mind must cease to be afraid of hypothesis and imagination as aids in the search for truth not only in science but in philosophy' (p. vii). But one may also think that both in modern endeavours and also throughout the history of philosophy the imaginative and hypothetical element has been unduly prominent, and that in our forthcoming presumptive knowledge, which is the sole extant version, however corrupt, of truth about reality, there lies to hand a good deal more of external control than free speculation or original composition has been wont to recpgnize. In this case one will have more hope of advance in philosophy when actuality shall be given a fairer chance of telling its own tale instead of being more or less silenced while abstractionism is encouraged to talk fiction.</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 305 Mr Whittaker begins -his essay on ' A new metaphysic of evolution' by asserting that the question as to whether the past series of events is infinite or finite cannot be set aside if we would seek a philosophy of the cosmos. He seems to use ' infinite' in the sense of endless in time and innumerable in number; at least he does not invoke the 'new infinity' of mathematicians. It has been a common opinion since Kant that this question cannot rationally be put because it involves application of the forms constitutive of phenomenal knowledge to the ontal or noumenal. Mr Whittaker, however, takes the question to be soluble, saying that the indefinite regress is not only unimaginable but inconceivable or unthinkable. By this he apparently does not mean that indefinite regress is ruled out by the laws of thought, which are not laws of reality (actuality) but rules for thinking or for its thought products. He appeals to the individual thinker and asks if he has the capacity to think, e. g. of his having had an endless number of previous lives. I fear this appeal can decide nothing: equally competent thinkers answer questions of this sort differently. And that is natural enough if what an individual finds thinkable is dependent on his apperception-systems. The thinkable-in-itself, like self-evidence when taken (so to speak) as per se, is an abstraction and a nonentity. And if, psychologically, ideas or concepts are but images ' defecated to pure transparency' or, though derived from images, are no longer imaginal because only forms without quasi-sensory content, the hard and fast line between the imaginable and the conceivable must perhaps dis appear in so far as guidance as to the actual is concerned. In any case Spencer's principle of the inconceivability of the opposite seems to be a criterion of believing, not of truth. However, not to waste time on a preliminary matter, and assuming it to be settled that endless regress is actually impossible, we may agree as to the next step in the argument, viz. that the proximate causes of physical science are, at least from the point of view of scientific exposition, but ' occasional' causes: not that ' power' or efficiency is denied everywhere, but that it is not to be placed in moving mass-particles or in laws of impact. But even so, though science, in the exposition of its achieved results, may dispense with the anthropomorphic notion of efficiency, it remains true that the work of science would be impossible if she did not recognize actual determination and the conditio sine qua non. And if this actual determination be vaguely said to be ' analogous to' logical necessitation, such as only can obtain between forms of propositions, it differs from timeless implication even to disparateness, although rationalists have identified, numerically or qualitatively as the case may be, the order and connexion of things with the order and connexion of ideas. VOL. XXVIII. X</page><page sequence="3">3&lt;6כ THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES At this stage the author resorts to another ' axiom', ' nothing from nothing \ This is applicable only to what begins to be, else we are back at the endless regress and there never was not a world, of some sort. The world that began to be, I take it, is the world of events in time ; the self-subsistent world from which the temporal world is ' evolved' is timeless. We observe that Mr Whittaker deliberately applies 'evolu tion ' to the world as a whole. Of course as ' evolution' is currently used in science, this application of it to the world as a whole is im possible. Evolution as epigenesis involves an environment as well as the evolvent; but to the world as a whole there is no environment, no opportunity for give and take. ' Evolution', then, as used by the writer, must be of the ' preformation' kind ; whatever comes out of the potential must already have been in it. And then we have on our hands the old puzzle how the temporal emerges out of the timeless. ' Possible' and ' potential' have ever been words to conjure with; and despite Mr Whittaker's awareness of the cautions of Ward and Bradley which he has duly weighed, I venture to think he has not succeeded in escaping the net of ambiguity. Whether the ' possible' means the ideal that may become actual, like Stevenson's idea of the engine before it was constructed in iron, or whether the ' potential' be under stood in the sense in which we say an acorn is a potential oak—in which case the potential is already an actuality of some kind—there is no transition from the possible or the potential alone to the actuality derived from it. Stevenson needed artificers ; and an acorn needs air, water, &amp;c., if it is ever to become a tree. Thus potentiality such as we ascribe to the seed is irrelevant to the universe. Mr Whittaker seems to have committed himself to a task similar to that of Spinoza, though prima prima facie not so hopeless because, instead of the infinite substance which is nothing in particular because everything in general, he endows his pre-mundane and timeless world, from which the temporal world is evolved, with differentiation into many within the one; to effect which Spinoza had to resort to a kind of causality which his premisses precluded. But, again approaching Spinoza, Mr Whittaker refuses to regard his pre-mundane Eternal One as a creative spirit. The ' principle י of the pre-mundane is 'thought'. But whether 'thought' means the product of thinking or the thinking-process, it should imply a thinker or thinkers ; if it denotes neither, I can but take it to be a name denoting nothing. A ' teleological idea of the individual', as pre existent, while neither existing as an actual soul nor ' existing'—in quite another sense—as an idea, in the ordinary modern acceptation of the word, in the mind of a willing Spirit with a τε'λον, is a phrase to which I can attach no meaning and to whose denotation I can assign</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 307 no ontological status. Such י uncreated pre-existent possibilities', not being actualities like acorns, I cannot distinguish from nothings incapable of developing into anything. The same is the case with ' impersonal intellectand with the ' Thought before the world ' that ' must include thought of will and events in timeand that ' must manifest itself'. In short Mr Whittaker's new metaphysic of evolution seems to me a rehabilitation of the old method of hypostatizing abstractions, of conjuring actuality out of possibility, of giving to airy nothings, not indeed a local habitation, but a name : as if naming them conferred actuality upon them. If the main argument of this essay will not commend itself save to those who can take abstractions for realities of the highest order, the reader will nevertheless find in the essay many reflexions of an able and learned philosopher that it will repay him to consider.</page></plain_text>
