Traces of her can be found in an Irish ritual in which a king pantomimed copulation with a mare that was subsequently killed and cooked, her broth swallowed by the king. An apparent inversion of this ritual appears in ancient India: a queen panto- mimed copulation with a dead stallion to whom she had previously fed rice symbolic of seed. The striking parallels between the ancient Indian and Irish horse sacrifices have been discussed for fifty years,1 most recently by Jaan Puhvel,2 who has called attention to the significance of the reversal of the sexes in the two rituals-mare and king in Ireland, This essay was presented as my inaugural lecture in Swift Hall, University of Chicago, on November 6, 1978. Parts of it were taken from my book, Women, Androgynes, and Other Mythical Beasts (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, in press). 1 See Franz Rolf Schroder, "Ein altirischer Kronungsritus und das indogerman- ische Rossopfer," Zeitschrift fur Celtische Philologie 16 (1927): 310-12; J.

By driving that wedge into some previously overlooked Indian mythological materials, and by seeking to extract from them certain structural and psychological patterns, it may be possible to gain new insights into the meaning of the ancient myth and ritual and to trace its later history in India. The ancient Indo-European ritual, which may be tentatively reconstructed from the extant Greek, Roman, Norse, Irish, Welsh, Germanic, Gallic, and Indian evidence, began with symbolic copulation between the royal figure and the equine figure (of whatever gender) and ended with the slaughter of the animal and the eating of its flesh or seed. The myth adds certain details to this equine Liebestod scenario: A goddess in the form of a white mare assumed human form and mated with an aging sun king. Impreg- nated by him through her mouth, she gave birth to hippomorphic twins, male and female, who incestuously begat the human race. The goddess or her evil black alter ego injured or threatened to devour her child or the king. She then disappeared. The myth ends here, but the ritual elaborates upon the simple disappearance of the mare and the simultaneous mutilation of the king: in the ritual, the king killed the mare and ate her in order to restore his waning powers. This text is not a true Indo-European prototype; that is, I do not wish to suggest that there actually was an ancient proto-Indo- European myth that contained every one of the elements I have included in my summary. I am not constructing a monomyth. But the summary does enable us to isolate the mythemes, to dis- tinguish the recurrent elements from those superimposed by a few individual cultural variants, to see patterns. In this sense, it may represent the core of the myth, but it is a thematic rather than a historic core. It may indeed turn out to be the historic core, but I am not prepared to prove this, nor is it relevant to my study of the meaning of the myth in India. Proto-Indo-Europe, the country east of the asterisk, is a never-never land less real to me than the world of the enduring cluster of motifs on which variations are struck, but the prototype is a heuristic intellectual construct. This "core" myth appears with many variations in different Indo-European texts, but the Irish and Indian are most detailed and best supported by ritual. In the Irish ritual (recorded in 1185 A.D. by Giraldus Cambrensis), a white mare was led before the king 2</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions in the presence of the people; the king approached her like a beast (i.e., from the rear) and "professed his bestiality" (a monkish euphemism for copulation with the mare). The mare was then killed, cut into pieces, and boiled, and the king bathed in the broth, drinking it by lapping it up directly with his mouth, not using a cup, and eating the mare's flesh.3 This brief text suggests far more than it states, but even here one sees in nuce three essential elements: the mating of the king with a white mare; the slaughter of the mare; and the eating of her flesh and drinking of her essential fluids. Although the Irish text is late, brief, and problematic (having been recorded by a monk who could scarcely believe, let alone understand, what he had seen), it is supported by so much other Indo-European material that it may be taken as an instance of a widespread and perhaps ancient myth. The one element unique to the Irish ritual-the eating of the mare's flesh-appears elsewhere only in its inverted forms, that is, the eating of the stallion and/or the eating by the mare. These two motifs jointly form a clear structural contrast to the Irish text. But the killing (without eating) of the mare is widespread in myth and ritual; since the stallion, when killed, is often devoured, and since this is generally the fate of sacrificial animals, it seems reasonable to suggest that the eating of the mare was also generally practiced. That the texts do not record this ritual can be explained by the suppression of positive mare myths and rituals in androcentric Indo-European traditions; this hypothesis will be one burden of the rest of this analysis. THE VEDIC RITUAL AND THE MYTH OF SARANYU In the Indian ritual, a stallion was fed balls of rice said to be symbolic of seed; he was then killed (by suffocation) and sym- bolically castrated. Finally the chief queen pantomimed copulation with the dead stallion, addressing him obscenely and urging him to copulate with her. This ceremony took place at the end of a year in which the stallion had been kept away from mares; a group of mares was kept penned up near the stallion at the time of the ceremony. The king, who lay in chastity with his favorite consort 3 Giraldus Cambrensis, Topographia Hibernica, ed. J. S. Brewer, 8 vols.

(London, 1905), p. 138. 3</page><page sequence="4">Cows and Mares during the eve of the ceremony, was to receive the powers of the stallion.4 Several inversions of the Irish ritual are apparent here, in addition to the central one (queen replacing king, stallion replacing mare). But since the king and the mare are present, albeit in secondary roles, one begins to see a conflation of two sacred models rather than the simple replacement of one by the other. The next inversion is similarly qualified: the Irish mare is eaten; the Indian stallion is fed. But this is superimposed upon a pattern in both rituals which requires that the human participants benefit from the ceremony at the expense of the sacrificed equine (divine) partners; and there are two human participants in the Vedic rite. Thus the queen is said to become pregnant not by eating the stallion but by feeding him, a symbolic inconsistency in the extant rite. Moreover, the true beneficiary in the Indian ritual is the king, who takes on the powers of the stallion, rather than the queen, whose increased fertility is of merely peripheral importance to the ritual. Thus the king grows strong not by eating the mare but by having the stallion (his alter ego) eat the seed that must, sym- bolically, be the stallion's own-a substance drained from him during his intercourse with the queen. These overlapping models suggest the possible loss of an intermediary rite in which the stallion (or his seed) was eaten by the queen-or, indeed, by the king. This hypothesis will be supported by the many myths in which the queen does indeed swallow the stallion's seed, as well as by later Hindu rituals in which a woman who wishes to conceive a son eats a ball of rice mixed with milk. Both of the two basic ritual models (the Irish and the official Indian paradigm) are preserved in the Vedic myth, where they coexist in a tension more blatant than that which we have found in the ritual. Here again we have both king and queen (in the form of the sun god and his wife) as well as both stallion and mare (their theriomorphic forms). However unlike the pairings in the rituals, in which the human participant had an equine partner, the myth depicts stallion with mare, anthropomorphic god with goddess. Aditi, the mother of the gods, brought forth eight sons. Seven were well- formed, but the eighth miscarried and came forth an unshaped lump, as broad as it was high, the size of a man. The other sons of Aditi became gods; 4 For various Vedic texts describing this ritual, see Paul Emile Dumont, L'Asvamedha, description du sacrifice solennel du cheval dans le culte vedique d'apres les textes du Yajurveda blanc (Paris, 1927). For more texts and further interpreta- tions, see O'Flaherty, Women, Androgynes, and Other Mythical Beasts, chap. 6. 4</page><page sequence="5">History of Religions but she pushed the eighth away, to propagate and then to die. His brothers, however, shaped him so that he was not lost; they cut the flesh away from him and threw it into a lump, and in this way they fashioned Vivasvant, the sun. Vivasvant married Saranyu (or Samjna, "bright image"), the daughter of Tvastr, the artisan of the gods. But she substituted for herself another, identical female, Chaya ("dark shadow") and went away, leaving the sub- stitute behind her. Vivasvant begat upon the substitute a son, Manu, the ancestor of the race of men. Thus they concealed the immortal woman from mortals. Saranyu took the form of a mare when she fled, but then Vivasvant took the form of a stallion and followed her. In their haste, the semen fell on the ground, and the mare smelled that semen because she desired to become pregnant. Thus the twin Asvins were born, and Saranyii abandoned the twins.5 This is the story as it is told in the Rg Veda and the texts immediately following the Rg Veda. Vivasvant is abandoned first by his mother and then by his wife, who also abandons their twins. His wife has two forms, dark and light-the dark form begets a mortal child, the light form, immortal twins. The psychological motivations and theological implications of these events may be surmised even from these early, often obscure texts, but they become clearer, through hindsight, when analysed in the context of later, far more explicit expansions of the myth-despite the fact that these expansions often introduce new points of view at direct odds with the Vedic viewpoint. Indeed, it is precisely at the point where these manipulations become most blatant that we can begin to discern the problem posed by the earlier texts. THE HINDU MYTH OF SARANYU AND VIVASVANT Before Saranyfi abandoned Vivasvant, she bore him twins, a boy and a girl, named Yama and Yami; she left him then because she was "unsatisfied with her husband's form." Meanwhile, Chaya, the shadow wife, mistreated her twin step-children, and the boy, Yama, kicked her, whereupon she cursed him that his foot would fall off. When Yama reported this to his father, Vivasvant realized that Chaya was not his true wife, as a mother could not harm her child that way; he modified the curse so that Yama did not lose his foot, but became the first mortal, king of the dead in the underworld. Then Vivasvant went to Saranyu's father, Tvastr, who told him that Saranyu had fled because he blazed too fiercely; Vivasvant asked Tvastr to place him upon his lathe and trim his form, and this was done. When Vivasvant had been given a handsome body by Saranyf's father in this way, he went to seek his wife. He found her in the form of a mare; 5 Rg Veda with the commentary of Sayana, 6 vols. (London, 1890-92), 10.17.1-2; 10.72.8-9; Satapatha Brdhmana of the White Yajur Veda, in the Madhyandina Sakha (Benares, 1964), 3.1.3-5; ~aunaka, Brhaddevatd, Harvard Oriental Series, no. 5 (Cambridge, Mass., 1904), 6.162-63, 7.1-6; Yaska, Nirukta, ed.

She turned to face him, to protect her hindquarters, and his seed entered her nose. In this way the twin Asvins were born. Then Saranyi resumed her own form and went back home with Vivasvant.6 How has this version changed the myth? The initial mutilation of Vivasvant because of his mother's dissatisfaction with him is now duplicated, and he is mutilated again, this time because of his wife's dissatisfaction-while his son, Yama, is mutilated as a result of being abandoned by one mother and abused by a second. Now that the mortal twins, Yama and Yami, are abandoned, the immortal twins, the Asvins, are not. Finally, a reason is given-at two different points in the myth-to explain why Saranyf deserted her husband, and a new reason is given for the abnormal mode of her impregnation. Where the first text implied that the Asvins were conceived through the nose because Saranyu wanted to become pregnant, in the later variant it is said that she did so to avoid becoming pregnant. These changes suggest ways of interpreting the myth in terms of its development within changing contexts of Indian culture. A few themes are repeated over and over, with variations. In the first version, the ambivalent Indo-European goddess has already been split into several female figures. Indeed, in retrospect we can see the significance of the proliferation of the women in the Indian rite, where the king lay with his favorite consort who remained chaste, but the stallion lay with the official queen who behaved obscenely, reversals of both of their normal roles. In the myth, too, Saranyfi has two doubles (her "shadow" and the mare that she becomes) and two natures (the loving mother and the wicked stepmother or rejecting mare-mother). The image of the destruc- tive mare applies to Saranyi in three ways within the second text, though two of the episodes are transferred to other mothers. First, Vivasvant's mother miscarries him and tries to kill him (a danger from which his brothers rescue him by trimming his form); then the "shadow" mother causes Yama's leg to be mutilated (a danger from which his father rescues him by making him fall to the under- world); and finally Saranyii's desertion causes Vivasvant to be trimmed again, this time (significantly) by his wife's father. The third episode-the trimming of the mature sun-appears only in post-Vedic texts and is clearly a development of the first 6 Mdrkandeya Purdna (Calcutta, 1862), 77-80, 103-5; Mahabhdrata (Poona, 1933-69), 1.60; Harivamra (Poona, 1969), 1.9.1; Matsya Purana, Anandasrama Sanskrit Series no. 54 (Poona, 1907), 11; Visnu Purana (Calcutta, 1972), 3.2; see also O'Flaherty, Hindu Myths, pp. 65-70, 318-19. 6</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions episode-the trimming of the embryonic sun. In early versions of the third episode, in which there is still a strong influence by the first, it is said that Saranyfi left her husband because he had "no form at all," or was perfectly round. However, as the myth develops, it is said that the sun had an unbearable brilliance, that he was too majestic for her, and so he had to be "trimmed down" (i.e., made round, as he is today) before he could be a suitable companion for his little bride. The shift from a husband unaccep- table because of his inferiority to one unacceptable because of his superiority is highly significant in the history of the mare. But whether she is stronger or weaker than her husband, Saranyu injures him; Vivasvant is mutilated by two women, his mother and his wife, and his son, Yama, is mutilated by a third, the step- mother. In all three cases, a father or brother officially minimizes the damage but actually inflicts some physical injury upon him. The psychological implications of these family dramas, replete with incest and mutilation, are readily apparent without the need for sophisticated psychoanalytic devices, and they are, I think, highly relevant to a full understanding of the myth.7 However, the present analysis will focus instead upon certain structural patterns that suggest important theological developments. IMMORTAL WOMAN AND MORTAL MAN; MORTAL WOMAN AND IMMORTAL MAN The two patterns of the myth of Saranyu are based upon contrast- ing perceptions of the power balance between the two main participants: Saranyui is more powerful or less powerful than her husband. This in turn is a reflection of the conflation of two contrasting ritual images: Saranyu is the divine mare with a human consort (the Irish ritual), or she is the human queen with a divine stallion as her consort (the Vedic ritual). The two levels of the myth may be chronologically discrete (the mare goddess of the ancient Indo-European world preceding the stallion god of Vedic India) though this is difficult to prove. In any case, the two patterns appear to be fully integrated in the transmitted versions that we have. But by sorting them out and separating them, we can see the process of their interaction. In the myth of Saranyi in the Rg Veda, the sun (whom we would normally regard as an immortal, and who is definitely a god in the Vedas) is a mortal. This is emphasized by the story of his birth, for 7 See O'Flaherty, Women, Androgynes, and Other Mythical Beasts, chaps. 2, 4, 6. 7</page><page sequence="8">Cows and Mares he fails to reach the gods and is "born to die." 8 Saranyu, however, is immortal. This immortality, and its role in causing Saranyui to leave Vivasvant, is one of the very few things that we learn about her in the cryptic Rg Vedic verse that is the earliest source of her story-"They concealed the immortal woman from mortals."9 In the Rg Veda, the gods conceal her from her husband (as they conceal Urvasi, the swan maiden, from her husband, king Puriira- vas10); in the Puranas, Saranyfi flees of her own will but for the same reason. As Bloomfield remarked long ago: Saranyu presents Vivasvant with the twins Yama and Yami, but after this the feeling that she is the victim of a mesalliance gains ground more and more. The poet at Harivamsa 547 has a true sense of the situation when he says: . . ."Saranyi, endowed with beauty and youth, took no delight in the form of her husband." Possibly the story aims to convey a more special form of Saranyfi's dissatisfaction, which peeps out not only in her abandonment of her husband, but more clearly in her metamorphosis into a mare: Vivasvant in his human capacity may have failed to satisfy the instincts of the goddess, which were probably laid out on too large a scale for his mortal capacities.... 1 Bloomfield states the case with nineteenth-century delicacy but with unmistakable insight: the metamorphosis into a mare reveals the woman's "large scale instincts." These instincts drive her to leave Vivasvant in the early Vedic variant; but as her status drops in the post-Vedic period, they cause her to flee from him because he is "too brilliant" and to have him "cut down to size" by her father (instead of by his mother, as in the earlier text). The fact that the Saranyf myth is a hierogamy between a mortal and an immortal thus accounts both for Saranyi's desertion of her husband and for her "trimming" of him. Either the sun is impotent and abandoned by the goddess or, later, he is too powerful and therefore castrated by the mortal woman, a no-win situation if ever there was one. In the first text, she abandons him before she has children and returns to him in order to become pregnant. In the second, she abandons him after she has children and flees from him in order to avoid becoming pregnant again. In the first text, 8 Rg Veda, 10.72.8-9. 9 Ibid., 10.17.2. 10 Ibid., 10.95.9; Satapatha Brahmana, 11.5.1.2-4. In the latter texts, the Gandharvas abduct Urvasi back to heaven by revealing him to her, in violation of their contract. This is one of several inversions of the usual pattern of immortal woman and mortal man (where she must not be seen by him). 11 Maurice Bloomfield, "Contributions to the Interpretation of the Veda," Journal of the American Oriental Society 15 (1893): 172-88, esp. p. 178 (emphasis added). 8</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions she is a figure of fertility, the goddess who unites with the king in order to produce immortal progeny; in the second text, she is an erotic figure who rejects her mortal progeny. This transition from good mother to evil mother is highly significant in the Indian context. Indeed, still later texts tried to restore a modicum of maternal spirit to Saranyfi by stating that she turned away from the stallion because she feared that he might not be her husband.12 This gloss makes good sense in the light of emerging concepts of caste marriage but is untrue to the original spirit of the myth. THE GOOD AND EVIL GODDESS Thus on the human level the ambivalence of the goddess is expressed by the contrast between the good mother and the evil mother. On the divine level, the positive theology of ingesting the goddess or having fructifying contact with her (the Irish ritual) comes to interact with the negative theology of being eaten by the goddess or being sexually drained by contact with her (the Vedic myth). At first the mare is mutilated, chopped up in the cauldron; the immortal mare dies so that the mortal king may live. The ultimate power transferred from her to him is the power of im- mortality and rebirth. But then the Vedic stallion is castrated; the mantle of immortality passes from a male divinity to a human king. The mare has only a vestigial role, and the human queen acts as a mediary between human and divine male figures. Thus there are two basic patterns of variation on each of the many levels of the myth: equine/human, immortal/mortal, male/female, killed/killing, eaten/eating (see appendix). In the Irish ritual, good power flows from above, from the mare to the king. In the Indian myth, evil power flows from above, from the mare to the sun king, or power is drained up from the mortal- flowing in the "perverse" direction. This is symbolized by the flow of fluids-the mare's essence ingested by the Irish king, the sun- stallion's essence ingested by the Indian mare (with the Vedic stallion as an intermediary case-fed by the queen but fed his own substance and not hers). One may conjecture that the positive pattern (good power flowing from above) is earlier and the negative pattern (evil power from above) later. In any case, however, both models come to exist side by side at a very early period and reveal a theology that must be confronted as an integrated problem: the 12 Mdrkandeya Purana, 103-5. 9</page><page sequence="10">Cows and Mares goddess who can destroy or bless, the ambivalent goddess whose presence is always desired even when her essence may be death. The simultaneous existence of the paradigms of mortal man/ immortal woman (mare) and mortal woman/immortal man (stallion) produces complex moral conflicts in the mare mythology. The myth of the mare and the king (which also comes to appear as the swan maiden and the prince) confronts the myth of the stallion and the queen, Leda and the swan. There is a tantalizing appearance of historical chronology in the myth of the mare if one separates these strands. At first there is one mare-goddess, an awesome and dangerous creature, sacred in Otto's sense of the word, a source of power who invigorates the aging king and dies in a sacrifice of her immortality to his mortality. At this period, the mare is still whole, integrated. But under the influence of increasing Indo-European androcentrism (Dare one say male chauvinism ? One dare.), the mare goddess was split into two parts, the good and evil mother. Here we begin to have proliferations of women in the rituals and the myths. Now it is feared that the mare will take away the powers of her lover, and so the auspicious (albeit dangerous) white mare must be given a malevolent black alter ego who threatens to kill or mutilate the king. Also at this time, the image of the mare was overlaid by another already available Indo-European image of the goddess who mates with a mortal-the swan maiden, a far more delicate and "feminine" image, frail, in need of protection-though still morally ambi- valent: the good, chaste Odette and the evil (erotic) Odile. Finally, the goddess was demoted to ignominious mortality and passivity as the model of mortal woman and immortal man rose above the model of immortal woman and mortal man. Now the helpless female was left hoping against hope that the great horse/swan god would deign to visit her (riding on his white horse). Now Leda awaits Zeus, awaits the moment when she might, in Yeats's words, "put on his knowledge with his power/Before the indifferent beak could let her drop." THE SACRED COW IN VEDIC AND HINDU MYTHOLOGY The demise in the status of the mare was accompanied by an equivalent rise in that of the cow. The cow was already a powerful symbolic figure during the heyday of the mare (just as the stallion was); it is a matter of reemphasis and revalidation of existing sacred models rather than the usurpation of an old model by a new one. In the Rg Veda, as in all ancient Indo-European cultures, 10</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions cattle are of great ritual value.l3 The magic wishing-cow, who appears in Ireland as well as in India,14 is the earth milked of good and evil substances by gods and demons.l5 She is churned out of the ocean of milk, and in turn the ocean of milk, from which all else is churned forth, flows from the udder of the wishing-cow.16 In Vedic India, stallions are far more sacred than mares, and cows are more sacred than bulls; equines are properly male, the female being "unfemale"; bovines are properly female. Horses are, as a species, revered for masculine, aggressive qualities, which accounts for the preference for stallions over mares. Cattle, on the other hand, are passive and play a receptive, creative role. The seed of the stallion is the counterpart of the milk of the cow; the phallus of the stallion is the counterpart of the udder; the Rg Veda abounds in metaphors that play upon this equivalence.17 The creative fluids that flow from the cow and the stallion are each androgynously, unilaterally capable of giving life. When the ocean of milk is churned, the two sacred animals that emerge are the magic wishing-cow and the sun stallion, Ucchaihsravas.18 The Rg Veda thus presents two positive theriomorphic images (cow and stallion) and faintly adumbrates the third image, the already negative mare descended from the ambivalent Indo-European mare goddess. But several elements of the cluster of Vedic symbolic and ritual patterns become dramatically altered within 1,000 years. In the Hindu period, cattle have become preeminent over equines, and mares are now regarded as dangerous and demonic. The reasons for this may be seen in the change in the attitude to women from the Vedic to the Hindu period. The Vedic poet made no distinction between erotic and fertile women, though women were in general relegated to the background of Vedic life and goddesses are of minor importance in the Rg Veda.

These cultures present non-Indo-European parallels to the Indo- European mare-goddess in terms of integration, though not in their theriomorphic symbolism, for there are no mares at Mohenjo-Daro. But from the period of the Upanisads and Buddhism (ca. 700 B.C.), the cult of asceticism reared its ugly head. Lust came to be regarded as the work of the devil, woman as the servant of the devil and the most dangerous enemy of the ascetic. Even in the Rg Veda, one encounters the myth of the dangerous seductress who sucks the man dry.19 By the late Vedic period, the myth of the king who devours the mare was replaced by the myth of the mare who devours the man. The Vedic image of the fertile cow that gives milk is retained and now contrasted with the image of the erotic mare who steals the equivalent of milk-the stallion's seed. The cow feeds her child; the mare eats her son (and her husband-who are, in many cases, one and the same helpless male). The cow that symbolizes the breast from which all good things flow is contrasted with the bad cow, the bad breast that feeds itself,20 the mare that drinks the fluids. Ironically, this basically female image (the self-nourishing breast) is applied in India more often to the male (the yogi who keeps his own seed within his body) than to the female (the bad mother), and with polarized moral values: it is good for a man to hold in his fluids (to keep the woman from getting them) but bad for a woman to do so (to keep her child from getting them). The Vedic stallion who sprinkles his seed upon the earth to fertilize it has now been changed into the stallion whose forces are bottled up inside him, curbed and bitted to generate power like a Ferrari revving up its motor in neutral. In this context it is instructive to look back upon the strangely involuted horse sacrifice-recorded several hundred years after the Rg Veda-in which the stallion is fed seed-combining the functions of the ancient Vedic stallion or Indo-European mare (to give seed) and the Vedic or Hindu mare (to eat seed). The stallion of the horse sacrifice behaves like a yogi: he contains his seed within himself, and is, like a yogi, under a firm vow of chastity, even (or, rather, especially) in the presence of the mares at the sacrifice. 19 Rg Veda, 1.179.4. 20 Melanie Klein, Contributions to Psychoanalysis 1921-1945 (London, 1948), pp. 357-65; O'Flaherty, The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology, pp. 355-57. 12</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions THE INSATIABLE MARE-FIRE BENEATH THE SEA These negative connotations of feminine sexuality, contrasting with the new ideal of the cow, were then applied to mares. The Vedic symbolism of the fiery stallion tamed under water,21 a positive image reinforced by the Upanisadic concept of the harnessing of the senses (which are likened to wild horses),22 was given demonic overtones and a change of sex. The result was the myth of the mare-fire beneath the sea, lurking until the time of its release at doomsday, smoldering under hair-trigger balance with the floods of the ocean, constantly straining at the bit to burst forth and destroy us all. This is the fire with the head of a mare.23 The fire of the mare's mouth drinks the waters of the ocean and lets them out again; eventually this fire of the underworld will destroy the universe, at the end of the age. The fire is in her mouth because the mare is the great devourer. The mare fire is associated with the demon powers that lurk in the underworld that is its home; it is also associated with death, sometimes said to be the wife of Death.24 It is frequently used as a metaphor for a voracious or unsatiable energy: "Not by anything can the fire of hatred be assuaged; it is inextinguishable, like the submarine fire."25 The mare beneath the sea is considered to be a particularly apt metaphor for the insatiable appetites of a promis- cuous woman,26 and the elements that make up the image (fire, water, death) combine in the descriptions of evil women: "Fire is never satisfied with fuel, the ocean is never filled by the rivers, death is never satisfied by living beings and women are never satisfied with men." 27 In noting the popularity of this proverb, one psychiatrist remarked on "a secret conviction among many Hindu men that the feminine principle is really the opposite [of the chaste ideal-the cow]-treacherous, lustful and rampant with an insatiable, contaminating sexuality." 28 When the gods and demons churn the ocean to obtain the elixir of immortality, a poison emerges and threatens to devour the gods 21 Gopatha Brdhmana (Leiden, 1919), 1.2.8. 22 Katha Upanisad, 3.4-6. 23 See Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, "The Submarine Mare in the Mythology of Siva," Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society 1 (1971): 9-27. 24 Brahma Purana (Calcutta, 1954), 116.22-25. 25 Mahdbhdrata, 12.137.41. 26 Siva Purdna (Benares, 1964), 5.24.29; Mahdbhdrata, 13.38.25-29. 27 Siva Purana, 5.24.29-34. 28 Sudhir Kakar, The Inner World: A Psychoanalytic Study of Childhood and Society in India (Delhi, 1978), p. 93. 13</page><page sequence="14">Cows and Mares until Siva, the great yogi and drinker of poison, swallows it.29 The poison is merely another aspect of the destructive fire waiting to come forth from the sea, a devouring poison that can only be destroyed by being devoured in its turn by the god who holds in all fluids. In another myth, a demon named Raktabija [Blood- Seed] (because every drop of his blood turns into the seed from which another demon is instantly born) threatens the world until the goddess creates another goddess to drink up the inexhaustible flood. The goddess commands this fury, "Open your mouth and drink his blood as if your mouth were the fire of the mare." 30 Since the demon's blood is seed, the goddess is behaving like the man- eating, castrating mare; since the seed is an unending flood, she becomes the insatiable fire in the ocean. There are many myths about the origin of the mare-fire, most of them involving a woman who violates her vow of chastity and becomes pregnant in an abnormal manner.31 Another cycle of myths attributes the birth of the mare to the violated vow of chastity of a yogi-the greatest of all yogis, Siva himself. In this myth, Siva is seduced from his meditation by the combined efforts of Parvati (an aspect of the erotic goddess) and the god of desire incarnate, Kama. At the moment of the seduction, Siva opened the third eye in the middle of his forehead and burnt Kama to ashes; but the fire of Siva's anger combined with the fire of Kama and began to burn the universe. To protect the gods, Brahma gave the fire the form of a mare with ambrosial flames coming out of her mouth. He led her to the ocean and begged him to keep her within the waters, letting her devour the ocean waters until doomsday. The ocean agreed to this.32 The fire that Brahma made into the mare is the fire of suppressed passion and anger. It is the destructive force of rigid chastity breaking out in lust and hatred, here (and elsewhere) attributed to a yogi but more often attributed to a woman controlled against her will.33 The Indo-European mare was dangerous because her erotic powers were untamed, the overpowering forces of a goddess.

The submarine mare, by contrast, is a symbol of thwarted power, human or divine; it is the image of resentful, unwilling chastity imposed on the female by terrified males; it is passion denied and suppressed, divinity denied and devalued. The yogi is a positive image of powers held in and controlled (though the myth of Siva and Kama indicates hidden reefs even in those quiet waters); the woman who holds back her milk is the image of the evil goddess. The myth of the mare implies that a man may voluntarily hold in his powers, while a woman will do so only under compulsion. Yoginis, who do undergo voluntary self-control, are quickly assimilated to the herd of mares; they are the servants of the ambivalent Kali, dangerous and highly erotic females.34 In the Hindu view, a woman's suppressed or repulsed eroticism is as volatile and explosive as nitroglycerine. We say that hell hath no fury to match this, and the Hindus say that this is the Fury that breaks out of hell at doomsday. Thus erotic, nonfertile energy-mare power-came to be contrasted with nonerotic, fertile energy-cow power or yogi power. The mare is lascivious and destructive, while the stallion (or the yogi) and the cow are (primarily, though not without exceptions) fertile and creative. The fact that only the male horse is ritually acceptable is evident from a myth that horses used to have breasts until Siva cut them off.35 Horses should not have breasts; cows should have breasts. The horse-headed female Yaksa (Yaksini) was once a positive symbol of combined eroticism and fertility; as the mare falls into disrepute, so these folk figures take on a darker aspect. The Yaksini with the head of a mare is depicted in Buddhist sculptures carrying off terrified men to a fate worse than death,36 and Buddhist literature warns about them: a horse-headed Yaksini was in the habit of eating the men that she captured, until she fell in love with one whom she forced to marry her.37 Another Buddhist Yaksini, a beautiful mare named Valavamukhi ("mare head" or "mare mouth," the same term used for the underwater doomsday fire), was pursued by a king; she 34 See Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty, Asceticism and Eroticism in the Mythology of Siva (Oxford, 1973), motif 27ea: erotic Yogini. 35 Mahabhdrata 8.24, appendix 1, no. 4, lines 15-21; Matsya Purana, 138.40-42. 36 Philip Rawson, Erotic Art of the East (New York, 1968), pl. 42; Stella Kram- risch, The Art of India (London, 1955), pl. 14. 37 Padakisalamanava Jdtaka, no. 432. 15</page><page sequence="16">Cows and Mares plunged into a pond, but he grasped her mane, subdued her, and rode her into battle.38 The first mare is curbed by being persuaded to substitute sexual passion for a more direct form of devouring, but she remains the aggressor, attacking her lover. The second mare plays a more positive role (going back into the water instead of emerging from it like the doomsday mare): she is pursued, captured, subdued, and used aggressively by the king; in this she is more like the ancient Indo-European mare. Indeed, Buddhist sculptures depict men happily mounted upon creatures with the heads of women and the bodies of mares.39 These oppositions in semiequine Buddhist females may be seen as survivals of the two different models of ancient mare myths, one positive and one negative. They may also demonstrate a shift in attitude as a result of the emphasis or de-emphasis on the mare component by changing the distribution of head and body. The head of the creature carried its primary symbolic meaning in the ancient sacrifice and in later myths of horse-headed gods. Thus a creature with the head of a mare and the body of a woman is more mare than woman, while one with the reverse pattern is more woman than mare. The mare-headed figure actively attacks and carries off men, while the mare-bodied figure is pursued (running swiftly with her equine body, designed for flight rather than for attack) and is passively ridden by men. The mare-head overpowers; the mare-body is conquered. Significantly, the creature with the body of the mare usually has not only the head of a woman but the top torso and therefore the breasts of a woman-the element that makes her "safe," cowlike. THE MARE WHO EATS AND THE COW WHO FEEDS The qualities feared in the mare are the mirror image of the qualities revered in the cow. As the mare is transformed from a deity who is eaten-the eucharistic goddess-to the demon who eats, so too the cow is transformed from the sacrificial animal who is eaten (for in the Vedas, cows were the piece de resistance at the meals of gods as well as humans) into an animal who is not eaten.40 In the pattern of the mare, the alternative to being eaten is eating-which is what demons do; in the pattern of the cow, the 38 Mahavamsa, 10.53-62. 39 Maurizio Taddei, The Ancient Civilization of India (London, 1970), pls. 37 and 155, from the 2d century B.C. and the 5th century A.D., respectively. 40 Ludwig Alsdorf, Beitrdge zur Geschichte von Vegetarismus und Rinderverehrung in Indien (Wiesbaden, 1962). 16</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions alternative to being eaten is a combination of feeding without being eaten (by giving milk) and not being eaten. This option is not available to the mare, and one can only speculate why. Apparently the ancient Indians did not drink mare's milk as so many other Indo-Europeans did. Perhaps the fact that the mare came to be defined as nonmaternal precluded the use of her milk; perhaps she could never be regarded as the source of any fluid other than her own seed, the equivalent of the seed of the stallion who replaced her so early in the Vedic rite. As to the reasons for the cow's transition from an animal sacred and therefore to be eaten to an animal sacred and therefore not to be eaten, many factors are clearly at play-social, economic, historical. However, among them must surely be the revulsion against the once devoured and now devouring mare, the corresponding sanctification of the nurturing cow mother and the mythology of milk as preeminent over the mythology of blood and seed. The cow is not an unequivocally benevolent figure, but her negative aspect is a result of her failure to fulfill her role rather than a negative quality inherent in that role. Even in the Vedas, the earth-cow is both black and white; she yields good milk and bad milk.41 In later Hindu mythology, the earth-cow on one oc- casion holds back her nourishment until she is physically attacked and made to yield her food. She must be forced to change from the evil mother (holding back her fluids) to the good cow from whom all things flow-milk that she explicitly calls her seed.42 When the ogress Putana offers the infant Krsna her breast that is smeared with poison instead of milk, she means to kill him; Krsna, however, sucks out her blood and her life's breath with the milk and kills her instead. Piutana then goes to heaven, for by offering Krsna her breast-even in a spirit of hatred-she has performed the supreme act of maternal devotion.43 Thus even bad mothers are good in Hinduism; the only bad women are nonmothers. Similarly, even bad cows (and there are myths of destructive cows) are good: a cow whose calf had been beaten by a Brahmin vowed to avenge him and assuage her own sorrow; she kicked the Brahmin's son to death and immediately turned from white to black as evidence of her sin, but she then regained her white color and her purity after bathing in the sacred river Ganges44 (the river that is the Milky 41 Satapatha Brahmana, 5.3.4-7; Atharva Veda, 8.10.22-29. 42 Visnu Purana, 1.13.80. 43 Bhagavata Purana (Bombay, 1932), 10.6.1-44. 44 iva Purana, 4.6.1-65. 17</page><page sequence="18">Cows and Mares Way in heaven, another Hindu symbol of the milky goddess-and a galaxy that, significantly, the atavistically horsey Irish call the mare's tail).45 The cow cannot remain evil. She is immediately purified, for she is purity; she is nonerotic fertility. Thus the ancient goddess has been split into two-the cow, symbolizing woman as the fertile nourishing mother, and the mare, symbolizing woman as the erotic devouring whore. THE TANTRIC MARE The mare is no longer worshiped, but she remains a powerful religious symbol. The cow, by contrast, is now enshrined as the quintessential sacred animal. Nevertheless, the cow is not divine; she is not a goddess in Hindu India. Quite the contrary, she is the image of the mortal woman with the immortal man, for she is the very model of the Hindu wife who regards her husband as a god (as the Hindu law books remind us ad nauseam). Though it has become a cliche to say that Indians "worship" cows and "worship" their mothers, this is true only in the most debased and fatuous sense of the word. Most Indians do not actually dedicate temples to cows or (heaven forfend) sacrifice goats to cows. They do, however, worship and offer blood sacrifice to a mother -but she is hardly the cow mother. She is the mare mother. The mare has returned in spirit though not in hippomorphic form. She has returned as the Tantric goddess whose presence is invoked by her human male worshiper, whom she invigorates with her sub- stance through ritual intercourse in the Tantric ceremony. It is expressly stated that the fluids of the female flow to the male in this ceremony as the powers of the goddess flow down to her male devotee who visualizes himself as her divine consort.46 Her power flows to him as the cow's milk flows to her son-and as the ancient mare's broth flowed into the Irish king. For by reversing the flow of the fluids (reinvoking the ancient image of the flow of seed from woman to man), Tantrism reverses the flow of power. The erotic goddess is a source of power while the fertile woman is a danger expressly shunned by the Tantric philosophy that elevates nonmarital, nonfertile love (parakiyd) above conventional married love (svdkiyd).47 The goddess is immortal and gives immortality; she is the erotic woman whose 45 Personal communication from John Leavitt. 46 See O'Flaherty, Women, Androgynes, and Other Mythical Beasts, chaps. 2, 4, 6. 47 See Edward Cameron Dimock, Jr., The Place of the Hidden Moon: Erotic Mysticism in the Vaisnava Sahajiya Cult of Bengal (Chicago, 1966). 18</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions power flows down to the man. But the wife is mortal and deadly; she is the fertile woman who drains away his fluids. In this world view, mares are a source of power and cows a source of loss of power, though these ideas are not expressed theriomorphically. Normal life is living death; ritual life, by inverting normal sexual processes, procures immortality.48 The goddess bestows her immortality on her mortal consort by uniting with him in the ritual. This Tantric image, which has roots in the ancient Vedic ceremony of the chaste student and the prostitute,49 filters back into non-Tantric Hinduism, where it confronts the image of the dangerous mare and the safe cow. The result is the revalidation of the ancient ambivalence characteristic of the full goddess and not merely a one-dimensional inversion of an equally one-dimensional Hindu model. For in the local and regional cults of the goddess in India, the image is fully integrated. REBIRTH FROM THE DEVOURING GODDESS Under a combination of influences-the resurgence of local non- Aryan (perhaps even pre-Aryan) cults of the goddess and more widespread regional cults of ambivalent figures like Sitala and Manasha,50 as well as the pervading contribution of Tantrism to non-Tantric Hinduism, a new goddess has emerged in Hinduism- or perhaps not such a new goddess. For when the goddess is regarded as a positive figure, a source of power, she ceases to devour and begins to feed-but without turning into a mere cow. This is the positive eucharistic model: to dismember and eat the mare is to absorb the deity's power. Indeed, as myths such as that enacted in the Bacchae of Euripides tell us, the refusal to devour the god is the direct cause of being devoured by the god. Eat or ye shall be eaten, the myths cry out. The threat of being devoured by the goddess is tempered, however, by the force of another compelling line of mythology and 48 Mircea Eliade, Yoga: Immortality and Freedom (New York, 1958). 49 For the Mahavrata ritual, see Eliade, Yoga, p. 257. 50 For Sitala, see Ralph W.

This concept, foreshadowed in the Vedas, emerges clearly in the Brahmanas. There it is said that the god Indra obtained Soma, the elixir of immortality, by being devoured by the demon Susna, who kept the elixir in his mouth. The demon swallows the god and brings him back to life, thus rendering him immortal (as does the elixir).51 This pattern is replicated in three Epic and Puranic myths revolving around Sukra, the priest of the demons. These myths function as three episodes of a single myth. 1. Sukra had the power of reviving demons who fell in the battle between gods and demons. To prevent him from using this power, Siva swallowed Sukra, but when praised by Sukra, Siva released him after giving him an epiphany of the universe within his belly. As he emitted Sukra through his penis, henceforth Sukra was called Sukra, "semen." As he emerged, Siva still wished to harm him, but Devi, the goddess, interceded, pointing out that as he had come out of Siva's phallus, Sukra was now not only an immortal but her son. Siva then let Sukra go.52 2. Sukra continued to use his mantra of immortality to revive all the demons who fell during the battle. Siva, knowing that Sukra could not be killed (perhaps because he, Siva, had once swallowed him), created a horrible woman with a mouth like a great cavern, with teeth and eyes in her vagina. At Siva's command, she grabbed Sukra and stripped him and embraced him, and she kept him inside her until the battle was over.53 3. The gods sent Kaca, the son of the priest of the gods, to obtain the secret of immortality from Sukra. Sukra swallowed Kaca unknowingly-the other demons had killed Kaca, pulverized him, and mixed him in wine which they fed to Sukra. When he found out what had happened, Sukra emitted Kaca again at the intercession of his daughter, who was in love with Kaca, and taught him the mantra of immortality. Kaca refused to marry Sukra's daughter, however, arguing that by dwelling in Sukra's belly he had become the son of Sukra and could hardly marry Sukra's daughter, his own sister.54 51 Kathaka Samhitd (Leipzig, 1900), 37.14; O'Flaherty, Hindu Myths, p. 281; see Sadashiv A.

He is reborn as the child of the gods, the son of the terrible mother. These myths may be seen as symbols of initiation and of the rebirth implicit in violent, death-mimicking initiation. Although a god or demon or demoness (it matters little which) is usually the devourer, in each case it is a goddess who intercedes and procures the immortality for the initiate. In the second instance, though the swallower is a textbook case of the image of vagina dentata, she nevertheless prevents Sukra from being injured. In effect, she brings him back to life out of her womb after the battle. So too, though the daughter of Sukra behaves like a mare, subjecting Kaca to an incestuous sexual assault,55 she saves his life-and is then denied by him, as the mare so often is. Elsewhere it is said that when Sukra and Siva were in competition, each invoked the same goddess-but she gave Sukra the secret mantra of im- mortality.56 The classical competition between son and father here has a happy ending: the devouring mother blesses her son. It would appear, therefore, that the Hindus retained a memory of a myth in which being devoured by the mare goddess was a source of religious rebirth. Although in androcentric texts it was a male god-a stallion (for both Siva and Sukra are powerful yogis)-who was said to do the swallowing, it was still a goddess who made the initiate immortal, a goddess who reappears in one variant of the myth as the actual devourer. Indeed, whereas in the pejorative mare myths the evil goddess simply devours her son, in these texts-perhaps under Tantric, devotional, and Saktic influence-the devotee becomes her son after she devours him and, as Kaca points out, thus becomes safe from her sexual assaults. When a male god swallows the devotee, he imitates the goddess by becoming pregnant with the child growing in his belly, before he reverts to male status and emits him through the phallus like seed. This "seed," however, is swallowed by the god in imitation of the mare and is thus a feminine rather than a masculine form of procreation. In this context, the many Hindu myths of male pregnancy57 may be seen as instances in which a god, in 55 For the theme of incest in the mythology of the mare, see O'Flaherty, Women, Androgynes, and Other Mythical Beasts, chaps. 4, 6. 56 Skanda Purana (Bombay, 1867), 6.1.149. 57 Cf. the male pregnancies of Tvastr (Atharva Veda, 9.4.1 and 9.4.3-6); Prajapati (Satapatha Brahmana, 2.2.4.1-8); Yuvanasva (Mahdbhirata, 3.126.1-26); Agni and the gods (Saura Purana [Calcutta, 1816] 62.5-12); see also O'Flaherty, The Origins of Evil in Hindu Mythology, pp. 343-45. 21</page><page sequence="22">Cows and Mares imitation of a goddess, gives rebirth to the initiate by swallowing and disgorging him. The link between swallowing semen and swallowing Soma is implicit in the Vedic myths of Indra and becomes explicit in the myths of Sukra, who is actually called "semen" as a result of being swallowed. This concept reemerges in Tantrism, where the seed is called amrta, the elixir of immortality. One particular Tantric ritual development holds interesting implications for the development of new attitudes to the devoured and devouring goddess. Tantrism retains the ancient yogic concept of the man's need to retain his semen while adding to it the (even more ancient) concept of his rejuvenation through consuming the woman's seed.58 Some Tantric texts apparently allow the man to emit his seed but only in order to draw it back again into his body. One text even seems to specify that he should emit it into the mouth of the woman, but again it is eventually restored to him: the semen is passed back and forth from the mouth of the woman to the mouth of the man and is finally placed in a consecrated vessel, whence it is eaten.59 One Tibetan Tantric text offers several variations on this theme. At first, the male adept emits from his mouth a stream of sacred syllables; then he visualizes the goddess before him, "the diamond demoness"; he then visualizes himself as the god and the mother on his lap. The white vajra (phallus) of the father unites with the red lotus (vagina) of the mother. The deities then enter into union in the sky and enter the male adept through his mouth or between his eyebrows. They descend, pass through his vajra, and fall and mix into the lotus of the mother. Then the mantra goes "upward from mouth to mouth" (i.e., from the woman's mouth back to the man's). This is regarded as the forward recita- tion of the mantra. "If the direction is reversed, upward through the diamond path and into the mouth of the goddess, this is the fierce recitation; &amp; I practice each of these in turn." This reversed direction has the seed-mantra travelling up the spine, out of the 58 For the antiquity of the concept of the seed of the woman, see Rg Veda, 1.105.2, 1.159.2, 1.160.2, 6.70.1; Brhaddranyaka Upanisad, 6.4.20. 59 Abhinavagupta, Tantraloka, chap. 29, stanzas 127-28, pp. 88, 89, and 92, cited by J.

The fluid that circulates is primarily mantra, hence its primary locus in the mouth. It is also the substance of deity which enters through the top of the head, or the spot between the eyebrows, or the mouth. These are also the loci of semen in yogic tradition. The process of circulation begins with the entrance of the deities into the mouth of the adept-the devouring of the goddess (and the god). It ends (if a cycle can be said to end) with the power that has left the body of the adept coming back into him through his mouth as it entered in the first place. Again he devours the seed of the goddess, this time directly from his female partner. Thus he behaves like the asvamedha stallion who swallows his own seed in transition between rituals of taking in fluid (the Indo-European mare's or the Tantric deity's) and giving fluids (the Vedic stallion's or again the Tantric deity's). The reversal of this is called "the fierce recitation"; the seed mantra goes directly into the mouth of the woman, the dangerous process of being devoured by the mare. It does not stop here, however, but returns to the man through the Tantric process of sexual reversal- the drawing of the fluid from the woman's vagina to the man's penis. This reversal makes the "fierce" process of being devoured by the woman safe once again: there is no ultimate loss of fluid. Indeed, by positing an endless cycle, the system becomes eternally sealed; there can be no loss, only the constant infusion of deity. Thus the fear of sexual death is overcome, as the fear of death in general is overcome through the concept of rebirth; steady decline and loss is replaced by a self-renewing cycle. In this way, the Tantric ritual allows the adept to gain immortality by being devoured by the goddess as well as by devouring her. CONCLUSION: THE CYCLE TO END CYCLES The refusal to devour or be devoured by the mare is a denial of her divinity. Indian mythology, like so many others, abounds in tales of goddesses who doggedly and ruthlessly torment those who deny 60 Pad-ma dkar-po, "The process of generation of the wishing gem of the ear- whispered teachings," folios 1-19, trans. by Stephan Beyer, The Buddhist Ex- perience: Sources and Interpretations, Religious Life of Man Series (California, 1974), pp. 140-53. 23</page><page sequence="24">Cous and Mares them worship.61 The mare is feared because she is fierce because she is denied worship because she is feared.62 This pattern of denial is manifest on many different levels of the mythology: on the level of physiology, the male withholds his seed from the female; on the theological level, he withholds his worship from the goddess. In between is a continuum of encounters between mortal and immortal figures, encounters in which the male's refusal to give is both a cause and an effect of his belief that she will take his life's blood from him. The circle of theological denial has one escape-ritual worship. If one seeks the goddess, her presence may be a source of power or a loss of power; she may bless or damn, feed or devour. Yet one must seek her, for the alternative is brutally clear: if she is ignored, she will certainly wreak havoc. When the goddess is worshiped and accepted in her full ambivalence, the worshiper asks her to be present with him always. If part of her nature is pestilence and mindless destruction, why should one want her near? Why not merely placate her and ask her to go away ? 63 The answer to this may lie, at least in part, in her maternal nature: the essential function of the goddess is not her capacity to feed but to be there, even in her shadow aspect.64 The only unbearable harm that the goddess can inflict on the worshiper is to abandon him-as she so often does. This, not the mutilation, is the source of devastating grief, the terrible longing for the vanished divinity. The only evil mother is the one who is not there. Thus the worshiper invokes Sitala even though she will infect him with smallpox if she comes to him. Without her, pestilent though she may be, his life has no value. To allow the goddess to devour one takes courage; the goddess remains ambivalent, and being devoured is a risky form of worship. Even when she is gracious, her grace is a terrifying and painful form of religious passion. But one has little choice in this matter. If that is the way that god is; what can one do? If she is denied, she is certain to be destructive; if she is worshiped, she may or may not be destructive, 61 See Manasha's vengeance in Dimock, Jr., "Goddess of Snakes" (n. 50 above); Dimock, Jr., and Ramanujan, "Goddess of Snakes" (n. 50 above); and Edward C.

For its psychological parallels in the relationships of Hindu men with their mothers and their wives, see Kakar (n. 27 above), p. 95, and O'Flaherty, Women, Androgynes, and Other Mythical Beasts, chaps. 2, 4, 6. 63 For the theological implications of destructive grace, see n. 50 above. 64 Kakar (n. 27 above), p. 84. 24</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions and the worshiper may become immortal. The myth of Krsna and Piutana demonstrates that the worshiper who treats the god as a mother treats a son is assured of salvation-even if she takes the form of an aggressive, destructive mother. But the theology of bhakti presents a two-edged sword: the deity, too, may become manifest in a destructive way, and still bring blessings, ultimate salvation and rebirth. The psychological and theological circles present a pessimistic but not inevitable view of interaction with the goddess. For Tantric ritual may step in and introduce a reversal that short-circuits the compulsive self-perpetuation of destructive emotion. The ritual produces a special, highly structured, controlled context in which it is relatively safe to have sexual contact with the mare, to drain her fluids or even to be devoured by her. Moreover, it replaces the destructive cycle with another, creative cycle of fluids flowing into her mouth and back out of her womb, or the reverse (into her womb and out of her mouth), constantly reinfused with the power of deity. The devouring mare/whore gives back to the mature male worshiper who confronts her sexually the powers that the cow/ mother took from him when he confronted her as a child-or as a nonworshiper. By reintegrating the split goddess, Tantric ritual transforms the mare who holds back milk and saps virile fluids into the invigorating goddess who gives life by giving and taking fluid, the goddess who gives birth not as a cow, with milk, but as a mare, with female seed. This is the character of the goddess who holds sway over most of India today, villagers as well as kings. She is at once fertile and erotic, terrible and wonderful, mysterium fascinans et tremendum. In spirit, if not in form, she is our old friend the Indo-European mare. University of Chicago 25</page><page sequence="26">Q t ? I CO</page></plain_text>
