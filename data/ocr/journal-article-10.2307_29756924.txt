<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Iranian Face of Buddhism by David Alan Scott In its long history Buddhism encountered many cultures and religions in Asia, each with their own particular distinct backgrounds within which the Buddhist dharma was taught. At the widest level Buddhism had to express itself in the different Indian (including by derivation Sinhalese), Chinese (so including Japanese) and Tibetan (so including Mongolian) worlds. What we propose to do in this study is to show that at this macro-cultural level there was a fourth realm that Buddhism entered, the Iranian world. It should be remembered throughout this study that historically the Iranians were found over a much wider area than just present day Iran. Instead the ancient lands of the Tarim basin, Bactria, and Sogdia were peopled by various East Iranian speakers; while the Iranian plateau (modern Iran) was dominated by West Iranian groups of whom the most prominent were the Medes and then Persians. Buddhism entered these various Iranian zones. Its dominance of the Tarim basin is well documented and fairly familiar as a result of both archaeological finds made at the start of this century, and by the literary testimony of pilgrims like Fa-hsien (399-413) and Hs?an-tsang (629-645) and Huei-ch'ao (726). Dominance was achieved in Bactria, with a more limited advance into Sogdia, as literary records and increasing numbers of archaeological finds are indicating (Litvinskij 1970, 1981). Buddhism even expanded further westwards along the Persian Gulf (Ball 1976, 1986, 1989; Hasuri 1978) and Iranian plateau (Bulliet 1976), in the light of archaeological and topographical data, although in these more westerly areas it encountered strong opposition from the Zoroastrian hierarchy in Sasanian Iran. This particularly wide Iranian world disappeared with the coming of Islam in the 7th century to Iran, Bactria and Sogdia; and the progressive 'Turkification' of the Tarim basin from the 8th century onwards. It is true that Buddhism was reintroduced into Iran during the 13th century by the Mongol Il-Kh?ns (Jahn 1956), but it was a Kashmiri-Tibetan form which was swept away when the dynasty converted to Islam in 1295, and so does not come into our present study. What will be followed is consideration of that earlier Buddhist entry and stay for several centuries in the Iranian (in the wider sense of the term) world. To evoke Toynbee's phraseology how did Buddhism respond the challenge of the Iranian milieu? It might of course be argued that there was not really any meaningful Iranian identity that was shared between the various groupings. Certainly geographical and [i] 43</page><page sequence="2">political factors had resulted in different historical fortunes. The Tarim basin evolved into a series of oases trading cities spaced along the Silk Route of which the most notable were Khotan (Bailey 1982), Kizil, Kucha, Turfan, and Tun-huang (the entry point into China proper). By contrast the Iranian plateau witnessed the rise of powerful successive empires of the Medes, Achaemenians, Parthians, and Sasanians. The lands of Bactria and Sogdia enjoyed varying fortunes. At times the centre of powerful East Iranian empires like the Kushans and Hephthalites, at times under the sway of the Achaemenian and Sasanian Empires, and at other times fragmented into petty principalities somewhat akin to the Tarim basin. Culturally there were shared traits. Linguistically the various Iranian branches belonged to that same family, i.e. the 'Iranian' branch of the Indo-European languages. Furthermore a common Indo-Iranian and archaic Iranian cultural and religious stratum permeated all of the various Iranian branches, as shown for example in terminology, myths, cultic practices, and art. It should of course be noted that this common archaic religious stratum had later on received the imprint of Zoroastrianism. This overlaying imprint was most strong in the western parts of the Iranian world (e.g. Persians), had a more modest impact in Bactria and Sogdia (*), with the weakest imprint being seen eastwards in the Tarim basin. Nevertheless we can talk about Buddhism encountering both archaic pre-Zoroastrian, and Zoroastrian elements simultaneously throughout the Iranian world. It might also be said that talk of this Iranian world which Buddhism found itself in is unrealistic given the other non-Iranian cultural influences that were to be found; in particular the political control exerted by Hellenism in Bactria (4th-2nd centuries); the political control exerted by China in the Tarim basin at various times (2nd century B.C.-3rd century A.D., 7th century); and the entry of Indian cultural norms into Bactria, Sogdia and the Tarim basin alongside but at times independently from Buddhism. Nevertheless there still remained something of an underlying Iranian strength and shared values, to which Buddhism had to respond in one way or another. Buddhism entered this Iranian world with some existing predispositions concerning other cultures and religions. Although it had its own standard formulations like the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path and so forth, it also had a certain functional flexibility concerning doctrine and dogma. This was clearly expressed in the early Pali Vinaya Pitaka 2.10 where the Buddha was asked what constituted the dharma 'Truth, Teaching'. Instead of giving a doctrinal definition he was reported as contenting (*) Originally Zoroastrianism arose in an E. Iranian context, either in Seistan if we follow Gnoli's thesis or in Chorasmia if we follow Boyce. Despite this difference of location it has been fairly well established that Zoroaster's minister did take place in this setting east of the Iranian plateau. The irony is that between Zoroaster's time (c. 1200-1500 B.C.) and the founding of the Achaemenian Empire (c. 550 B.C.), this eastern orientation of Zoroastrianism was lost, and its centre of strength moved westwards onto the Iranian plateau, although a Zoroastrian presence still remained in those eastern areas like Sogdia and Bactria. 44 [2]</page><page sequence="3">himself with saying 'of whatsoever teaching thou canst assure thyself do lead to 'dispassion [...] detachment [...] content [...] solitude [...] energy [...] delight in good [...] this is the dharma, this is the discipline, this is the master's message'. That leaning towards a functional goal, namely the experiencing of enlightenment, was why the Buddha is recorded as refusing to answer a whole range of (for him) irrelevant and distracting cosmological and metaphysical questions in Pali texts like the Majjhima Nik?ya 3.56-57, Sutta Nip?ta 6.4, and Anguttara-Nik?ya 1.188. The experience of enlightenment was open to all, across cultures, and even across religions. In such a light the Buddhist text of the Mah?satya-nirgrantha-puta-vy?karana had the central edifying sermon being given by a Jain ascetic (Nakamura 1955). Mah?y?na schools developed this functional trend still further through the concept of up?ya 'skillful means', whereby the Buddhist dhanna was presented in accordance with the understanding and capacity of the hearer concerned (Pye 1978). The actual results of such approaches are well illustrated in the study by Ling (1979: 37-44) of actual Buddhist practice in modern Mah?y?na and Theravada countries, where he talks about an 'open frontier' towards surrounding animist traditions, and of a 'recasting of potent psychological symbols as a result of the stimulus of Buddhist spiritual experience' coupled with a 'Buddhist-inspired remythologizing'. It was with this sort of (potential) disposition that Buddhism entered the Iranian world. What we wish to find out is what sort of face did Buddhism present to Iranians? Five fruitful themes can be discussed in relation to that question; (1) Iranian terminology, (2) Iranian art motifs, (3) Iranian deities, (4) Iranian customs, and (5) possible Iranian influence on Buddhist figures. Let us consider each of these themes in turn. 1. Iranian Terminology Buddhist literature shows a "knowledge and readiness to use suitable Iranian religious terminology, a terminology that itself bore a mainly Zoroastrian imprint. Before going into this it should be pointed out how Iranian and Indian usages had radically diverged over some linguistic aspects despite their common earlier Indo-Iranian heritage. In particular for us is the way in which in India the term deva 'shining one' had been used to denote gods, while with the coming of Zoroaster the daevas had been condemned in Zoroastrian Iranian circles as of demonic nature, perhaps because of their blurring of ethical codes. Thus other terms were used in such Iranian circles to denote such heavenly beings, of which the most popular terms were baga 'he who distributes (good things)', and yazata 'beings worthy of worship'. In such a way did those Iranians replace the rejected deva/daeva term. Buddhist circles in various Iranian settings showed an awareness of such Iranian sensibilities. An early example of this came in the Ashokan inscriptions in Aramaic script (Mukherjee 1984), that were used to spread the dharma among the Iranian Kamboja communities of North-West India (in its old geographical sense) (Bailey 1971). [3] 45</page><page sequence="4">Altogether some six Aramaic inscriptions have been found of this Ashokan genre, one at Taxila, two at Kandahar (a Graeco-Aramaic, and an Indo-Aramaic bilingual), and three in the Laghman valley. Aramaic was an influential script, having been the lingua franca of the Achaemenian Empire, though Humbach (1974, 1979) sees the language of these Aramaic Ashokan inscriptions as being the local Iranian language of the Kambojas written in the Aramaic script. Whatever the exact nature of the inscriptions one thing emerges quite clearly, the fact that although they express clearly the Buddhist dharma that Ashoka was trying to inculcate (Scott 1985), a sensibility was shown to pre-existing Iranian usages. One immediate example of this was with the titles given to Ashoka. The Indian Edicts in Brahmi and Kharoshthi used Ashoka's title of Priyadarsi 'He who regards amiably/of gracious mien', which was retained in these Aramaic shorter versions. In addition the Brahmi and Kharoshthi Edicts gave Ashoka the epithet dev?nampriya 'beloved of the gods'. This term is strikingly absent at the Aramaic inscriptions of Taxila and Kandahar-1 where the more neutral and acceptable term mr1 n 'Lord' was used (Humbach 1978, Ito 1979), analogous to the term baga. By such a choice of words the term deva was thus avoided. Another feature of interest to us in these Aramaic inscriptions was in the favour given to the prefix hu 'good' when expressing Buddhist terms and ideas. At Taxila, Kandahar-1 and Kandahar-2 the Indian Prakrit term susrusa 'obedience' which was used in the Brahmi and Kharoshthi Edicts was rendered as hupatyasti 'good obedience' (Ito 1977, Humbach 1978: 92). Furthermore at Taxila the crucial Buddhist word dharma was translated as hunistavan 'good order' (Ito 1977: 155). It may seem rather forcing the issue to declare that this otherwise common prefix hu indicates sensitivity to Zoroastrian patterns of expression, but in this case such a prefix did carry with it clear Zoroastrian references. In Zoroastrian literature frequent references were made to their religion being based on good. Zoroastrian literature, from the earliest Gathic days repeatedly tied the notion of good into its core. One example is Yasna 45 where Ahura Mazda was the one recognizable, as was the pious Zoroastrian devotee, by the characteristic of 'good spirit', 'good deed', 'good word' and 'good mind'. In fact when we look further into the Gathic parts of the Avesta we find the Yasnas permeated with this qualifying adjective of 'good', being put in front of a whole range of beneficial qualities and aspects. To give the Zoroastrian impact of this prefixtural use of good we have in the Yasnas the following terms of 'fame' (30.10, 49.7), 'piety' (32.2), 'way of life' (32.5), 'rule' (33.11, 33.14, 51.1) 'determination' (34.10, 51.5), 'lineage' (49.6), 'conception' (51.17), 'gain' (53.5), 'purpose' (29.10) and 'mastery' (53.8) all given this prefixing adjectival use of 'good' in front of them. If we return to the Aramaic inscriptions erected by Ashoka it becomes clearer why the translations of obedience and dharma were given the prefix of good, rather than just being translated as obedience and order. By giving the extra prefix, which was strictly speaking unnecessary in linguistic translatory terms, a greater religious impact could be achieved through Iranian circles familiar with Zoroastrian usages. 46 [4]</page><page sequence="5">At a more subtle level still in these inscriptions was the use of language whose style evoked Zoroastrian mores. Within Zoroastrianism the central theme had been the totally opposed forces of good that had been created in Ahura Mazda and evil that had been created by Angra Mainyu. Such a fundamental opposition (as described for example in Yasna 30.3-5) gave rise to a perspective within Zoroastrianism of a cosmic struggle permeating the whole of existence, with each person being able to help the side of good (Ahura Mazda) or evil (Angra Mainyu) by that person's own individual actions. It is significant that both the Aramaic bi-linguals, one with a Greek accompaniment and one with an 'Indian' Kharoshthi accompaniment, have a very specific literary style with particular religious overtones which is not shared with the accompanying languages. Something of this sensitivity to Greek philosophical and religious norms has already been shown (Scott 1986) in a recent study. If we turn our attention to the Aramaic components a similar Buddhist sensitivity can perhaps be discerned, focussed this time on those local Zoroastrian-influenced outlooks and frames of reference. The Graeco-Aramaic bilingual at Kandahar, usually referred to as Kandahar-1, described the state of affairs under Ashoka in the tenth year after his accession to the throne. According to the Aramaic half as a result of Ashoka's following of the dharma 'evil among men has diminished in the world. Among those who have suffered it has disappeared and there is joy and peace in the whole world' (Benveniste in Schlumberger et al. 1958: 33). Ito (1977: 156) it is true translates evil as being rather disease, but apart from the fact that Zoroastrianism held disease to be the work of the evil Angra Mainyu, the sense is still clear of a diminution of bad &gt; increase of good. By contrast at Kandahar-1 the Greek half merely said that 'from that time he made men more pious. And all things prosper throughout the whole world' (Schlumberger et al. 1958: 3). A similar situation was seen with the Indo-Aramaic bilingual at Kandahar-2 where the Indian half gave just a positive description of the fruits of dharma, while the Aramaic half which was aimed at the Iranian population, used the Zoroastrian-evoking imagery of pairing the increase of good to the decreasing of evil (Benveniste &amp; Dupont-Sommer 1966). Now it may be argued that such Ashokan usages of Iranian terminology and style was merely the result of initial clumsy translation techniques. After all in China the early Buddhist compositions like the S?tra of 42 Chapters had been full of Taoist terminology, which had been dropped in the subsequent more polished and purified Buddhist compositions. Such dismissals though cannot be applied to the Khotanese situation where a whole range of Iranian religious terms were retained throughout the literature of this important Buddhist centre, from the 3rd to 10th centuries. One should not ignore or underesti? mate the widespread continuing usage of Indian terminology by Khotanese Buddhists, but the exceptions made to this in Khotanese literature when using Iranian terminology show a Buddhist awareness of the preexisting religious psyche of these East Iranian people. [5] 47</page><page sequence="6">It is instructive to find Khotanese literature and art keeping most of the familiar (to Buddhists) Indian gods, but crucially not referring to them generically by the tainted (to Zoroastrian Iranians) Indian term deva, but instead referring to such 'worshipful beings' (including the Buddha) by the Iranian term gyasta, which can clearly be linked to the Avestan term yazata (Bailey 1979: 109). Buddhist writers followed these Zoroastrian influenced Iranian usages over daeva/deva at Khotan, by employing the term dyu to describe demonic beings as a whole (Bailey 1979: 166). Other pieces of Iranian religious terminology can be followed in Khotanese Buddhist literature. Interestingly the key concept of dharma was at Khotan split into an Indian and Iranian derived form to cover its various Buddhist shades of meaning. This can be followed clearly enough in the Book ofZambasta, a text composed at Khotan during the 9th or 10th century, and which is an admirable Khotanese exposition of Mah?y?na Buddhism. In that text the Sanskrit term dharma continued to be used, e.g. 2.223 and 3.136-37, to denote the sense of constituent parts of matter. However when its sense of law and teaching was implied then throughout that text the Sanskrit dharma was replaced by the Iranian word data, e.g. 5.52 and 5.86. These Khotanese Buddhist writers also used the term data to construct phrases like buddha-d?tu (22.307) and d?t?-mah?y?na (12.2). Such an overtly religious use of this Iranian term had been witnessed much earlier in Zoroastrianism where in the Avesta one finds mazdo-d?t? (Yasna 51.19) and d?ta-zarathushtri- {Yasna 1.13). If we stay within the context of Khotanese Buddhism it is also relevant to see a substitution in some texts of the Iranian mythical world mountain ttairya haraysa (Avestan taera hara, Yast 12.25) in place of the Indian Mt. Sumeru (Bailey 1979: 133). Finally to note at Khotan was the utilization by some Buddhist writers of the Iranian theme of 'Good Fortune'. Found in the Avesta, as in Yast 19, that concept of Khvarenah persisted down the centuries into the Sasanian period where it was styled in Middle Persian as farrah. By that time in Sasanian Iran it had come to denote the regal quasi-divine grace that resulted for the ruler and country as a result of following the just (ashavan) Zoroastrian path. Khotanese Buddhists also used the term in its related form of ph?rra to denote good fortune which accrued as a result of following the Buddhist path (Bailey 1979: 261). In addition to this straightforward adoption the term ph?rra was also used in Khotanese Buddhist circles to signify the actual rank or position to which good fortune had brought a person. Such an adaptation was found for example in the Book of Zambasta 13.16 where it denoted the four stages of the Buddhist religious 'career'. The Khotanese were not the only Iranian Buddhists to use and develop that ancient idea of 'good fortune' in the Tarim basin, as Bailey (1973: xviii, 52-77) has demonstrated. Thus at Kucha one bilingual poem has the Indian laksml 'fortune' directly equated to the local Iranian-derived form of peme (Middle Persian farrah, Khotanese ph?rra). As at Khotan, at Kucha this term was given a further related meaning. One Kuchean example of this comes in the Udanostotra (8 b 4) where peme was used to translate the Indian termpada 'position'. Nearby at Agni a similar double usage ensued. 48 [6]</page><page sequence="7">On the one hand param was used to render 'good fortune', while in its form of parn-n it had this related sense of position, as for example in puttisparn meaning 'position of a Buddha'. This Iranian concept of 'good fortune' also cropped up among Sogdian Buddhist groups, where it took the related form of prn with a three-fold range of nuances! At one level it was still taken to mean literally good fortune, as for example in the Sogdian S?tra of Causes and Effects (490, 498) and Vessantara f?taka (31, 52, 895, 1198). As at Khotan and%Kucha the term was also used to denote the position or rank that such good fortune brought one to. In this vein the Padmacint?mani-dh?rani-s?tra used the phrasepwty'kh pm 'position of a Buddha' to signify Enlightenment. Besides the familiar nuances of good fortune and stage or position, pm was also used to give the sense of the external marks of the stage or position reached along the Buddhist path. One interesting Sogdian example of this came in the Dighanakha-s?tra 41 where prn was used to translate the Chinese term for mark (siang) which was equatable with Sanskrit laksana. Sogdian Buddhists showed a sensitive awareness of Zoroastrian Iranian suscep? tibilities over the term deva, with the Indian term deva-putra being rendered into the Iranian formulation of bag-p'tvr- (Bailey 1982: 50). In a similar way in the Vessantara J?taka 914 the Indian god Indra was not called by his common title adhi-deva but instead the Sogdian translators, if we accept the plausible case put forward by Sims Williams (1983), rendered it into ad-bag. The sense of 'supreme god' remained the same, but by substituting bag for deva local Iranian susceptibilities were placated. This particular concern shown in passing by the Sogdian translator is all the more revealing since the same concern to avoid where possible using deva in Iranian circles has already been mentioned in connection with the Aramaic Ashokan inscriptions, and Khotanese literature. The fact widely separated Buddhists reacted to this Zoroastrian-inculcated dislike of the term makes the Buddhist response all the more significant. The literary material mentioned in this section suffers from being in many instances only fragments unearthed by archaeology of a much wider corpus of Buddhist trans? lations and compositions from Iranian lands. In this respect we have but an incomplete picture. Nevertheless even this limited range of literary material shows some significant Buddhist responses to the Iranian milieu being revealed through sensitive and prudent adoptions of analogous Iranian terminology. A similar approach can be followed towards Iranian art motifs. 2. Iranian Art Motifs Art was just as important as literature for expressing the Buddhist dharma in a generally pre-literate Iranian world. For Buddhism it was a rather different artistic milieu within which secular sources (the imperial Achaemenid, Parthian and Sasanian dynasties) and religious sources (of in particular Zoroastrianism) had produced Iranian [7] 49</page><page sequence="8">forms of art which were at times different in style and concern from the Indian norms with which Buddhism was more familiar. Of course any talk of Iranian art needs to take into account the regional trends within it that were to be found in Persian, Bactrian, Sogdian, Kuchean and other Iranian centres. Furthermore in the Iranian lands there were other Hellenic, Indian, and (in the Tarim basin) Chinese strands that were far from negligible. With all these provisos in mind one can still meaningfully talk about the encounter of Buddhism with 'Iranian' art. Confirmation of this meeting comes in the various depictions of Iranian-dressed Buddhist lay devotees that was a common theme in Gandharan art (Rosenfield 1967: 215-49). In Bactria such local Kushan devotees were shown at sites like Qunduz (Fischer 1958), and high Kushans at Dalverzin-tepe (Pugacenkova 1978: figs. 29-30). Later on local Iranian dressed devotees were portrayed in Bactria during the 7th/8th centuries at Adzina-tepe (Litvinskij &amp; Zejmal' 1971: figs. 4-6), Kalai Kafirnigan (Litvinskij 1981: fig. 25), Bamiyan and Kakrak (Rowland 1974: fig. 48, ill. p. 112); and in the Tarim basin at Kizil (ibid.: ill. p. 162) and Kucha (Bussagli 1978: ill. p. 80). Within the field of Iranian art we can discern as we have said two major internal sources, secular and religious, and it is to the former that we turn. Within this sphere the influences of the great imperial dynasties were evident, from the Iranian plateau those of the Achaemenids, Parthians and Sasanians, and further east that of the Kushans. An early example of this came from Chamqala in Bactria where a corner pilaster capital had a Buddha/Bodhisattva sitting below a decorative foliage, on which was shown a frontal lion clawing at two addorsed humped bulls (Rowland 1974: ill. 10). The main point was to illustrate a j?taka scene from the Buddha's life, but the interest for us lies in the extra detail on top which can be identified as an adoption of the imagery used earlier by the Achaemenians at Persepolis (Hinnells 1973: figs. pp. 14-15). Architectural usages also show the impact of Achaemenian prestige. In particular the introduction of Buddhist temples' circumambulatory corridors, first seen in the lst-2nd centuries in Kushan Gandh?ra and Bactria (Kara? tepe) and later developed by the 7th century into the 4-iwan composition (as in Bactria at Adzina-tepe), has been argued by Litvinskij (1970: 124-29; 1981: 54-55) to have followed earlier Iranian trends signalled at the Achaemenian fire complex at Susa. The effect of such artistic and architectural processes would have been to make the Iranian viewer more at ease through familiarity of surroundings with this new religion. In the pictorial field it is striking to find in Gandharan art ? the focus for the encounter of Hellenic, Indian, and Iranian styles ? how there was the depiction of a whole range of Buddhist Bodhisattvas whose appearance evoked the contemporary Kushan rulers (Rowland 1961). Similarly the Indian god Vaisravana who achieved great popularity in the Buddhist circles at Balkh and Khotan, was iconographically modelled after Kushan imperial portrayals by Buddhist artists (Granoff 1970, Jera Bezard 1976). It has also been suggested by Rowland (1974: 102) that the very niches carved out of the cliffs for the huge 53-metre and 35-metre Buddhas in the 2nd-3rd centuries 50 [8]</page><page sequence="9">at Bamiyan in S. Bactria were an adaptation of the iwan of Parthian and early Sasanian palatial architecture. This was used in those imperial circles to bring the visitor into the realm of the divine, and perhaps then incorporated by Buddhists at Bamiyan to underscore the exalted achievement and status of Buddhahood. The most noticeable secular Iranian influence on Buddhist art came from the Sasanian dynasty (224-651), whose political power and cultural prestige reached a zenith under Khusro I 'the Just' under whose reign (531-579) Sasanian direct control was exerted over Iran, Bactria and even parts of N.W. India. It is from the latter area, more specifically around Kabul, that an intriguing description of a Buddhist shrine {bot-kh?ne) that was a vih?ra (bah?r) comes from the pen of Asadi T?si. His work the Garsh?sp N?me (comp. 1048) described the arrival of the Ghaznavid conqueror at this Buddhist centre (Melikian-Chirvani 1984: 273). According to Asadi T?si the vih?ra 's walls were made of marble, the doors were gilt (on a copper or bronze base?) and the flooring was of silver. On those marble walls were shown the planets, and the twelve signs of the Zodiac. In the very central focal point of the vih?ra (the pishg?h) was found an enthroned Buddha made of gold, with a 'face like the moon'. The facial appearance and recollection of the Buddha portrayed with a 'face like the moon' is an interesting point, as we shall see a bit further on. An immediate point made by Melikian-Chirvani is that there is a striking echo here of the description given to the famous Sasanian palace called the T?qdis. In the Sasanian T?qdis the enthroned imperial ruler was shown in the centre of the monument, with identical astronomical signs being depicted {Sh?hn?me). An interesting line of argument can be followed with this data. The astronomical symbols at T?qdis were defined in Persian as zamin-o-zam?n 'space (lit. 'earth, stretch of land') and time', which has led Melikian-Chirvani to see that the Buddha from Kabulistan was considered in a directly similar way as the 'enthroned King of the Universe'. We do need to be cautious over this theme since the cakravartin 'World Ruler' concept had roots in India (Verardi 1983), and subsequent Buddhist literary elaboration (Ling 1973: 145-46), being considered there as both the pious Buddhist ruler {dharma-r?ja) but also identified with the Buddha himself. What Melikian Chirvani's data suggest is that Buddhists from the Kabul area were using analogous Sasanian architectural and pictorial motifs to express and provide extra Iranian reinforcement for their Buddhist message. The Trano-Buddhist' art phase from Bamiyan during the Sasanian zenith (late 6th-early 7th century) even had Maitreya the future Buddha shown with a crown that was identical to that portrayed in Sasanian Iran for Khusro II (Rowland 1974: fig. 39). Sasanian style hair ribbons also appeared on another Buddha at Bamiyan {ibid.: ill. p. 88). Similar ribbons, together with massive proportions and general hieratic frontal style for the 'Blue Bodhisattva' (Higuchi 1983-1984: pi. 59) evoke the portrayals of Sasanian monarchs that were shown contemporaneously in Bactria at Dukhtar-i Noshirwan, and in Iran. In the same valley as Bamiyan, at the monastery of Fondukistan (fig. 8; Rowland 1974: ill. p. 113) Maitreya was shown with these Sasanian ribbons. [9] 51</page><page sequence="10">Similarities can be found with Buddhist art eastwards in the Tarim basin. Maitreya appeared at Ming-oi Karashar (ibid.: ill. p. 133) bedecked with these Sasanian ribbons during the 6th/7th century, as did several Buddhas and Bodhisattvas at the temple of Tarislark by Khotan (Bussagli 1978: 61). Very striking in its Sasanian appearance is the famous 'Persian Bodhisattva' of Khotan (Stein 1931, Bussagli 1978: pi. p. 57). When we start moving into the area of Iranian religious motifs, we can trace a similar pattern of Buddhist artists utilizing motifs in a direct way alongside their more established standard themes like the Buddha meditating and so forth. One such Iranian motif seems to have been that of a duck holding a necklace (figs. 1-2). This was a popular theme in Sasanian textile design, and was also seen at the royal Sasanian palace of Damghan and Khusro II's grotto at Taq-i Bustan. Although its symbolism is at present obscure this motif appeared in the 6th/7th century at Buddhist Bamiyan (Higuchi 1983-1984: pis. 42.2, 43.1) and even further east in the Tarim basin at Kizil and Tuyuk (Rowland 1974: ill. p. 60). Another quasi-religious motif of interest to us is that of the griffin. Generally this has been a symbol of wisdom and enlightenment (Cooper 1978: 76-77), and was a popular symbol in Sasanian Iran. It also appeared in Sogdia (Pugacenkova 1959) among non-Buddhist circles. Consequently it is intriguing to find this motif being used by Buddhist artists at Bactrian sites like Kara-tepe (lst-2nd century, Stavisky 1982: 27), Fayaz-tepe (lst-2nd century, Al'baum 1978) and Fondukistan (7th-8th century, fig. 6a). Other motifs, generated by Zoroastrianism, were also made use of by Buddhist artists in the Iranian setting. During the Kushan period of the lst-2nd century A.D. the Iranian centres of Shotorak and Paitava (near K?pisi in the Hindukush) produced a whole series of sculptures of the Buddha with flames shooting out from the shoulders (fig. 3; Rosenfield 1967: 200-201, Taddei 1974). This motif did not spread out into India, Nepal or Tibet; although it did become popular in the Tarim basin as for example during the first Iranian' phase at Qumtura near Kucha c. 650 A.D. (Bussagli 1978: pi. p. 86) and Tun-huang (ibid.: 32). Certainly there did exist within Buddhism the story of the Miracle of Sr?vasti where the Buddha was indeed said to have emitted both flame and water from his body, but the actual artistic motif was previously unknown in Buddhism. Its Iranian lineage (Rowland 1938; Tanabe 1981, 1984) is shown by its similar appearance on portrayals of Kushan and Sasanian emperors. In truth this artistic motif was a reflection of that Iranian concept of khvarenah 'good fortune' which we have already seen as having been integrated into Buddhist literature. With the Achaemenid and Sasanian rulers this was gained through following the Zoroastrian faith (Shahbazi 1980, Duchesne-Guillemin 1979), but the Buddhist artists were transferring it so as to indicate the good fortune, at an individual and political level that was to be gained through the Buddhist dhanna. In Zoroastrianism fire (atar) was the sacramental focus for worship to Ahura Mazda. As the bringer of warmth to mankind, and more metaphorically as the dispeller of ignorance and lies, fire was considered to be one of the very emanations ('sons') of 52 [10]</page><page sequence="11">[11] 53</page><page sequence="12">Ahura Mazda. Bearing this in mind it is clear that in Iranian areas fire had very strong religious nuances, of which Buddhist artists would have been well aware. This has obvious implications for the 'flaming shoulders' motif already mentioned. Indeed Kushan minters portrayed atar in an anthropomorphic way as a man having such flaming shoulders and called athsho. Alongside this flaming shoulders motif was the flaming halo that was sometimes used by Buddhist artists to entirely enclose the depicted Buddha. An early example (fig. 4) of this was found in 1979 by Soviet archaeologists at the Kushan site of Kara? tepe in Bactria, where a painting was discovered that showed the Buddha sitting in a meditating position totally surrounded by a circle of flames (Stavisky 1980), that he dated to the 2nd-3rd century A.D. It has also been suggested by some authors (e.g. Rowland 1949: 15) that it was the Buddha who was the figure enclosed by a similar flaming aureole in a coin of Peroz I, minted by him when he was Kush?nsh?h (i.e. Sasanian viceroy) between 235-242 A.D. Later on this motif was transferred to China from Central Asia, but did not spread in India. Instead it remained an Iranian feature with which we can argue clear Zoroastrian overtones. Again it should be noted that Buddhist literature provided respectable antecedents for using the motif of this halo of flames, but artistically the antecedents came from outside. Confirmation of the Zoroastrian overtones of this motif comes from Kara-tepe in Bactria, for below the painting was found a Bactrian inscription buddha-mazda. Stavisky sees this as being engraved by a local person, after the decline of the Buddhist community, but before its forceable conversion into a small Zoroastrian fire shrine c. 280 A.D. Whether the writer was a Zoroastrian or a Buddhist Stavisky found impossible to say. What is important though is that it shows how there was some local awareness of the Zoroastrian symbolism used in the portrayal of the meditating Buddha. Ironically Khotanese Buddhist texts distantly echo this buddha-mazda coupling, as shall shortly be seen in our following section on Iranian deities. At a wide artistic level mention should be made of what Bussagli (1978: 31-42) coined 'the aesthetics of light', which although expressed in various ways was for him 'throughout Central Asia [...] an essential characteristic', and which had also been traced to some extent in the art of Gandh?ra in earlier studies by Bussagli (1949) and Soper (1945-1946). While both writers accepted the undoubted partial Indian contributions to such an intangible yet pervasive concern, both saw Iranian influences as being the dominant force behind its marked regional appearance. Within this Iranian milieu which fostered an 'aesthetics of light' that Buddhist artists in turn adopted, the role of Zoroastrianism cannot be ignored. By its stark contrasting at the religious level between the forces of goodness and light on the one hand and those of evil and darkness on the other hand, Zoroastrianism laid the climate over the centuries for this artistic frame of reference to emerge. With all this talk of artistic responses and adaptations of terminology something of a coherent Buddhist approach seems to be emerging. However while such adaptations could indeed serve to put the Iranian enquirer at ease, more obvious religious concerns 54 [12]</page><page sequence="13">Fig. 3 - Haming shoulders motif, Paitava, 2nd-3rd century. Source Gaulier et al. 1976: pl. 29. would have been over the role and status for their more traditional Iranian deities within this new religion of Buddhism. It is then to the question of Buddhist responses to Iranian deities that we now turn. 3. Iranian Deities Buddhism entered the Iranian world bringing with it a plethora of traditional Indian gods (devas, devat?s) in its wake. Typical of the continuing Buddhist retention of Indian deities is one particular example from Kizil in the Tarim basin where Indra, Brahma and Siva were shown listening respectfully to the Buddha preaching (Rowland 1974: ill. p. 160; Gaulier et al. 1976: figs. 110-14, 117). This provides the key to Buddhist attitudes to deities. Powerful they indeed were on their plane of existence (deva-loka), but ultimately they were still chained by the laws of karma, which only the Buddhist enlightenment could break. That was why the ancient Pali account [13] 55</page><page sequence="14">Fig. 4 - Flaming bands motif ('Buddha-Mazda'), Kara-tepe, 3rd century. Source Stavisky 1980. in the Samyutta-Nik?ya 5.42 described S?kyamuni's moment of Enlightenment as 'surpassing the divine majesty of the gods'. Within the Iranian world Buddhism was faced with various new deities to whom it had to respond. Given its existing outlook this posed no great insurmountable problems. Consequently some Iranian deities were identified at a functional level with familiar subordinate (within a Buddhist framework) Indian deities, while others were in their own right just integrated in such a subordinate way. Some facets of this were shown with Iranian goddesses encountered at Khotan. In various Khotanese texts the Indian goddess Sri 'prosperity' was directly replaced by Ssandr?m?ta 'sacred/bounteous earth' who as Spenta Armaitis was well known in the Avesta (Bailey 1967). This Iranian goddess had somewhat ironically already been subsumed by the multi-faceted Mesopotamian goddess Nana (Azarpay 1976, 1981: 132-39) in Sogdia. In turn a goddess identical in portrayal and description to the Sogdian figure appeared in Tibetan Buddhist circles at Gyantse and in their literature (Tucci 1963). Returning to Khotan we find Buddhist writers mentioning in passing another goddess called Sakhimi (Bailey 1942: 89), unknown in India and so presumably of local Khotanese provenance. Another ancient Iranian deity encountered by Buddhism was Mithra, the upholder 56 [14]</page><page sequence="15">of contractual obligations and truth who came to enjoy pronounced solar characteristics. At Bamiyan during its Trano-Buddhist' art phase of the 6th/7th century in the niche around the 35-metre Buddha we find a subordinate deity (fig. 5). Although Melikian Chirvani seems to have considered this as a 'lunar Bodhisattva' (1974: 54) in fact we are faced with a solar deity (Rowland 1938, 1974; Kashiwase 1966; Higuchi 1983-1984: pis. 22, 23.3) who is none other than Mithra driving his solar chariot and accompanied by his dawn maidens. What we have here is Mithra's subordination, as but a god, to the Buddha. At a more subtle level the juxtaposition of solar god with Buddha may also be said to imply that the deity's qualities of solarity and uncovering of truth were fully applicable to and enjoyed by the Buddha. Among contemporaneous Sogdian Buddhists there also seems to have been some awareness of Mithra, for in the Sogdian version of the Vessantara J?taka there is mention at verses 1205-1206 of 'Mithra, the Judge of Creation, together with the mountain spirits, the forest spirit, and the spirit of the source' (Gershevitch 1959: 34). This is significant for it reveals a local form of Buddhism since this mention of Mithra is absent from the Pali version of the Vessantara J?taka. The Sogdian perception of Mithra as the 'Judge of Creation' is an accurate reflection of Mithra's role as the personification [15] 57</page><page sequence="16">of the sanctity of contractual obligations, and thus enjoying in Zoroastrian circles this role as a judge after death of people's behaviour in life (e.g. Mithra Yast 92). In such Buddhist circles it is instructive to see how Mithra was treated. His appearance in the Vessantara J?taka is not a prominent one, instead he was mentioned in passing to support the quest by the lay hero Susashan who was trying to achieve Buddhahood, i.e. Enlightenment. As part of his path, i.e. training, he had renounced all his wordly possessions, at which point Mithra was invoked as a witness to Susashan's contractual promise to renounce his belongings. Mithra is shown as being accepted as a god, and indeed his moralistic aspect of helping contractual promises to be kept was invoked by the local Sogdian writer. However the point of the episode was not to foster special devotion to Mithra. Buddhist enlightenment was still seen as a higher goal than traditional devotion to gods and goddesses, although such deities could be invoked in support of that overriding higher goal. This consideration of deities as being useful but subordinate adjuncts to the primary Buddhist core had a further implication, namely that when divorced from the primary Buddhist goal then unqualified devotion to deities was at best foolish and at worst misleadingly erroneous. This was why the Pali Dtgha-Nik?ya 11.26 had a low opinion about the efficacy of the worship conducted by certain devotees of the sun. In an East Iranian context similar reflections were passed on sun-worshippers in the Khotanese Book of Zambasta 24.167. A natural partner in the Iranian world to the solar Mithra was the lunar god Mao. 58 [16]</page><page sequence="17">During Kushan times these two gods were issued on some coins of Huvishka (Rosenf ield 1967, coins 113-114) as a pairing Mao-Miiro. In a similar fashion these two Iranian gods appeared as a pair on a dedicatory casket offered by the Kushan emperor Kanishka and placed by him in the Buddhist vih?ra at Shah-ji-ki Dheri built under his aegis (Dobbins 1971). On one side of the receptacle was shown the Buddha flanked in a subordinative way by the Indian gods Brahma and Indra; while on the other side was shown a Kushan ruler, probably Kanishka, flanked in a similar way by the solar Mithra and the lunar Mao. This 'juxtaposition of Buddhist and Mithraic imagery' (Dobbins 1968: 160) could well imply that those Iranian gods could like the Indian gods play a similar supportive role within Buddhism. Later on in the 7th-8th century at the Buddhist monastry of Fondukistan, there was a similar pairing of the lunar Mao together with an Iranian dressed solar figure who was probably Mithra (fig. 6; Rowland 1974: fig. 54). At a more subtle level Mao could be adopted by Buddhists to transfer those lunar qualities and forceful spiritual qualities (e.g. renewal, cyclic change) to the Buddha, in much the same way as we have already suggested for the solar aspects of Mithra. This may explain the emphasis in early Persian literature to the beauty of the 'moon [17]</page><page sequence="18">faced Buddhas' Bot-e M?hr?y (Melikian-Chirvani 1984: 274), to Mas'?di's notice in his Mur?g ad-dahab 'Fields of Gold' about the famous Buddhist vih?ra [Nowbah?r) at Balkh being 'placed under the sign of the moon' (p. 47-49), and to the 35-metre Buddha of Bamiyan being known as the Kheng Bot 'Moon-White' Buddha. Besides such Iranian figures Buddhism seems to have shown some awareness of specifically Zoroastrian figures, which is really only to be expected given their rivalry. In the Sogdian Vessantara J?taka 914, alongside Indian gods like N?r?yana and Vaisrava came another god called zrw\ Although the accompanying iconographic identification of a beard links him to the absent Indian god Brahma, his name shows him to be none other than Zurvan '(Infinite) Time', who in the Zurvanite strand of Zoroastrianism was held to be the original remote creator of both the good Ahura Mazda and the evil Angra Mainyu. Sogdian Buddhist literature was usually taken from Chinese Buddhist sources (Utz 1980: 7), so this Iranian exception is all the more significant. A local substitution of Zurvan in place of Brahma was functionally quite appropriate, and happened throughout the J?taka, a feature not seen in the Pali version. Of all Zoroastrian figures Ahura Mazda should have most come to Buddhist attention. At present we do not have much relevant extant material on this. One sign (?) of this encounter comes from the Kushan site of Kara-tepe in Bactria. In our previous section on Iranian artistic motifs there has already been mention of the intriguing picture found in one of its cave temples of a meditating Buddha surrounded by two bands of stylized flames. In itself that indicated Iranian modifications to the incoming Buddhist iconographic repertoire. This Buddha was part of a large wall painting, and of special interest for us has been the even more recent discovery of a figure shown to the side of the Buddha, also portrayed in a meditating position, with his left hand raised in reverence to the central Buddha, and which Stavisky (1982: 24) sees as a local deity greeting the Buddha. Identification of this figure is difficult, but it would seem no coincidence that this attendant (local?) deity is surrounded by flames. Generally in Sasanian Zoroastrian circles Ahura Mazda was not portrayed in anthropomorphic terms, with instead fire serving as a direct symbol for both him and the Zoroastrian religion in for example Sasanian and Kushano-Sasanian coinage. What we can suggest is that at Kara-tepe there was this pictorial representation of the Buddha with Ahura Mazda shown in attendance on him. This would be a reasonable theme from a Buddhist perspective since both in India and in the Tarim basin it was a common theme to show Indian deities in attendance to the Buddha whilst he was teaching the dharma 'truth'. If our interpretation of the Kara-tepe enflamed deity is correct, then the accompagning Bactrian inscription buddha-mazda can be reinterpreted. As mentioned earlier Stavisky saw this as referring to the seated Buddha being considered by some local visitor as a syncretic fusion of the Buddha and Ahura Mazda. Such a syncretic fusion is possible. However in the light of this later find of the enflamed god in attendance it could be that the inscription buddha-mazda is but a straightforward description of the painting's main persons, i.e. the Buddha and Ahura Mazda. 60 [18]</page><page sequence="19">In this context further archaeological excavations at Kara-tepe have revealed the above enflamed god in attendance (Ahura Mazda?) to be part of a whole line of seemingly attendant figures (Stavisky 1986: fig. 2). Despite their poor surviving portrayal Stavisky sees them as various local (i.e. Iranian-based) deities shown as, with Ahura Mazda (?), paying hommage to the inflamed teaching Buddha. As such this would then be an Iranian equivalent to the homage paid to the Buddha by Indian deities mentioned at the start of this section. If we turn our gaze to other Buddhist circles there are some other signs, albeit fleeting, of Ahura Mazda. In the Sogdian Vessantara J?taka there is no direct mention of Ahura Mazda. However some authors like Humbach (1974: 398-402) and Belenitsky &amp; Marshak (1981: 29) have considered the deity called ad-bag to be Ahura Mazda. At first sight this seems rather questionable, since Sims-Williams (1983) has convincingly argued that the form ad-bag was a local rendering of the Sanskrit epithet adhi-deva 'supreme god' enjoyed by Indra. In our section on Iranian terminology this local Iranian adaptation of the term has been discussed. Nevertheless we have already witnessed how in that same J?taka passage the local Sogdian Buddhists equated Brahma to Zurvan, and in a similar functional way from a Buddhist perspective Ahura Mazda the supreme deity for orthodox Zoroastrians could be equated to Indra the adhi-deva, through using a suitably adapted Iranian epithet that could simultaneously be taken to apply to both functionally similar deities. The point that should be taken here is that deities like Ad-bag were mentioned by the Sogdian writer not as a focus for Buddhist devotion, but merely as recognition of the existence of deities which despite their reality and power were still overshadowed in Buddhist eyes by the higher and more profound goal of enlightenment which did not lie through the gods. Buddhist circles in Khotan show some faint signs of Ahura Mazda's presence. In Buddhist literature from there, Ahura Mazda appears in an oblique form of urmaysde (compare Middle Persian form of Ahura Mazda ohrmazd), used to denote the sun (Bailey 1979: 40). This meaning has been retained down to the present day in the archaic East Iranian languages like Ishkashmi (remuz) in the remote upper valleys of the Amu Darya where the shelter of the Pamirs enabled Zoroastrian pockets to survive right up till modern times (Scott 1984). Does the Khotanese form used by local Buddhists reflect a pre-Zoroastrian ancient form of Ahura Mazda as Duchesne-Guillemin (1973) has argued? Interesting as his hypothesis may be it should be pointed out that in the Avesta (Yasna 43.16) Zoroaster was recorded as declaring Ahura Mazda to have the appearance of the sun. Solar imagery could, and often did, lead to related metaphoric and spiritual usages. In this vein at Khotan there was an interesting pairing between the incoming Buddhist and preexisting East Iranian mores, for in the Book ofZambasta 24.236 and 22.261 both S?kyamuni Buddha and Maitreya the future Buddha were called buddha-unnaysde on account of them having 'removed the darkness of ignorance'. All of this was quite legitimate Buddhist reasoning, but at the same time there is an extra East Iranian twist. A well known Zoroastrian figure encountered by Buddhists in Iranian areas was [19] 61</page><page sequence="20">Fig. 7 - Verethragna, Bamiyan, 6th-7th century. Source Rowland 1974: pi. p. 89. Verethragna, the symbol of victory for the Zoroastrian faith, considered as one of the sons or emanations of Ahura Mazda, and traditionally most often shown in his form of a charging boar (Yast 10.70-72, 14). During the 'Irano-Buddhist' art phase at Bamiyan, in the group-D caves leading off from the 35-metre Buddha the boars head was a prominent motif on the ceilings (fig. 7; Higuchi 1983-1984: pi. 43.2). This was not an isolated Buddhist adoption for around the same 6th/7th century period at the cave temples of Toyuk, in the Turf an oasis area, there was a similar utilization by Buddhist artists of the boar's head motif (Rowland 1974: fig. 72). This was not an Indian motif, but was on the contrary a well established Iranian representation for Verethragna. With such a previously well established artistic convention, the Buddhist artist could at one level accept him as yet another powerful though subordinate deity, and even at a further level transfer 62 [20]</page><page sequence="21">his functions so as to proclaim to Iranian eyes the victory of the Buddhist dharma. Sogdian Buddhists may also have similary used Verethragna (2). A final Buddhist approach to Iranian deities could have come from a Mah?y?na application of preaching the dharma through up?ya 'skillful means'. In the Surangama s?tra 6 the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was said to appear in many different forms depending on the hearer's background and ability, even appearing if need be as the Hindu god Siva 'Mahesvara*. Likewise in the seminal Saddharma-pundarika {Lotus) S?tra 24 the Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara Tine Sound' was the one who 'appears in many kinds of bodies, everywhere preaching this s?tra [...] sometimes he appears as Sukra (Indra) or appears as Isvara (Visnu) or appears as Mahesvara (Siva)'. Both of these s?tras were familiar to East Iranian Buddhists. The former had been first translated into Chinese by the Bactrian Chih-lou-chia-chien in 178/179, and the latter so first translated into Chinese by another Bactrian Chih khian-lian-tsie in 255/256 (Nanjio 1881: 381-82, 300). Although we have no extant local versions of these s?tras, the Iranian deities known in those Iranian Buddhist circles could have been considered in a similar way by Mahayanists. 4. Iranian Customs What we are concerned with here in this section is consideration of Buddhist customs in the Iranian areas that show Iranian roots and differences, as well as Iranian customs that were rejected by Buddhism as being incompatible with the dharma. A starting point for the first theme, that of local Buddhist customs showing Iranian influence, could be the comments by the Chinese pilgrim I-tsing who visited India between 671-695. Whilst he was travelling in the subcontinent he heard about the differences amongst Buddhist communities over the upavasatha ceremonial fast days. As he put it (p. 49) 'the custom of reception on a fast-day differs also in [...] countries such as Tukh?ra [i.e. Bactria/Tukharistan] and S?li [i.e. Sogdia]. In these countries the host first presents a flower canopy and makes offerings to the Kaitya. A great crowd of priests surrounds the Kaitya and selects a precentor to offer a prayer in (2) Some relevant material comes in this respect from the 8th century Buddhist temple at Ak-beshim in E. Sogdia (Azarpay 1981: 34-35). A gold plaque found there showed a god and goddess together with outstretched hand holding a small image of a camel. This pair of deities are also known in non Buddhist Sogdian contexts, e.g. Afrasiab (6th century), Pjandzikent (8th century), with the god being portrayed on his own at Pjandzikent (6th century) and Varahs (8th century). One of Verethragna's incarnations, besides the popular boar, was as a sharp to toothed burden-sharing camel stamping forward. Thus it has been suggested that this figure portrayed at Ak-beshim and elsewhere was Verethragna, and perhaps his spouse. Perhaps though they were purely local Sogdian deities. Whatever the case, it is certain that the Ak-beshim pair are not of Indian provenance, and are of Iranian lineage instead. [21] 63</page><page sequence="22">full form. That done they begin to take meals. Rules about the flower-canopy are mentioned in the "Record of the West"'. It should be mentioned though that I-tsing did not see these different Bactrian Sogdian usages as being un-Buddhist, despite their differences in comparison to Indian and Chinese norms. For him (p. 50) 'although the ceremonies of an Upavasatha-day in different countries vary so much in the general arrangements as well as in the food, yet the regulation of the Brotherhood, the protection of purity, the mode of taking food with fingers, and all other rules are much the same'. The main point of difference between those East Iranian customs over the upavasatha on the one hand and those seen by him in Chinese and Indian circles seems to have been over the presentation of the 'flower canopy'. Unfortunately for us he refers us to a more detailed description of this in the Record of the West which is no longer extant. In itself though his mention quoted above does show us that there were some distinct customs that had evolved in the geographically contiguous E. Iranian areas of Bactria and Sogdia, and which were not a feature of Buddhist practices in India or China. Therefore the implication is that we have some sort of Iranian influences at work. Can this be backed up with other data? One significant feature is the use at Kara-tepe (PII) and Fayaz-tepe of ritual fire altars in the Buddhist (c. 2nd century A.D.) ceremonial complexes (Stavisky 1986: 219-20, fig. 27) ? significant given fire's central role in Zoroastrian rituals. If we stay within the important Buddhist region of Bactria there are some other indicators of (Iranian) variants in Buddhist practices. This comes in the form of early Islamic records, assembled by Melikian-Chirvani in his recent works. One interesting account of rituals practised at the major Buddhist complex in Balkh, the Notvbah?r 'new vih?rcf comes from Yaqut in his Mu'jam al-Buldan, written in the early 13th century, following his work in the Merv libraries for many years, from whence he incorporated the much earlier 9th century material of Omar ibn al-Azraq al-Kermani. Thanks to Yaqut we learn of the Buddhist practices at Balkh for 'when they built a fine monument or erected a new gate or great vaulted palace, it was their custom to crown it with odorous plants [...] When they built this shrine, they put on it the first odorous plant to be seen. That was the huhdr (orange blossom)' (Melikian-Chirvani 1984: 275). We do indeed probably have some sort of Iranian usage here, for while the sticking of ensigns (dhvaja) was widespread in Buddhism, the adorning of stupas with garlands is geographically restricted. We have the example here from Balkh, and a similar scene from the Buddhist centre of Shotorak in the Hindukush near Kabul where a stupa was shown supporting (laurel?) garlands (Meunie 1942: pi. XXII, p. 64). Moreover if we also relate this early Islamic material to the other information from I-tsing about the distinctive 'flower canopy' used in the upavasatha ceremony in Bactria, then an interesting possible link emerges. Traditionally the orange blossom was a symbol of fertility (Cooper 1978: 123), connected with the Iranian goddess Anahita/Ardoxsho, 64 [22]</page><page sequence="23">and capable of being used in an imaginative way to show the fertility of the Buddhist dhanna. Another noticeable rite practiced in Bactria was a ritual adorning of the Buddha, a rite found later in Far Eastern Buddhism, but which appeared earlier in Bactrian centres like Balkh and Bamiyan, and there judging by various early Islamic writers (Melikian Chirvani 1974: 16-18, 23-29, 41-46; 1984: 274-77) to have adapted the imperial Sasanian imagery in part, e.g. royal gems, crowns, dark blue veils, red drapery which are also found at Bactrian sites (3). If Buddhist writers were quite ready to use suitable analogous Iranian themes, their message so expressed was still that of the Buddhist dharma, which in its social aspects was still felt to be quite opposed to certain practices that had evolved in Iranian circles, and which had persisted under Zoroastrianism. Three particular Iranian practices received Buddhist criticism, namely those of incest, the killing of animals, and (mercy) killings of humans. The first to be dealt with, that of permitted incestuous marriages, between immediate kin, may indeed have been an imperial Achaemenid innovation (Boyce 1979: 53-54), but it came to receive Zoroastrian sanction in the Avestan and Pahlavi texts (West 1882). As such it was practised at all levels in Iran down to the 10th century A.D., being then superseded by marriage between first cousins. This ancient custom of khvaetvad?tha was frequently noted by Hellenic writers in Antiquity and also later by outraged Christian writers, for which the compilation by Fox and Pemberton (1928) remains a fundamental work. Buddhist writers also noted this Iranian Zoroastrian sanctioned custom. An early example of this came in the Sarv?stiv?din Abhidharma mah?vibh?sa-s?stra that was composed in the lst/2nd century A.D. by various teachers from Kashmir and Bactria (one Gosaka) who had assembled for the Buddhist Council held in Kashmir, under the aegis of the Kushan emperor Kanishka. In it was recorded how 'the tribes of mlecchas [barbarians] called Maga who live on the Western frontier have the following ideas, they have sexual intercourse with their mother, wife, elder (3) Melikian-Chirvani uses these real imperial Sasanian themes to make even further deductions concerning the nature of Buddhism in Eastern Iran in which he included Bactria. His concluding words (1984: 277) on this were 'The recurring mention of the royal gem and the crown makes the adorning of the Buddha sound like a crowning ceremony [...] extraordinary emphasis was laid on the rite [...]. Thus was the perennial motif of Iranian metaphysics ? the Supreme Divine Being as King of the World ? introduced into a system to which it was utterly foreign'. Certainly these imperial Iranian artistic motifs can be discerned in Buddhist art in Bactria, but to characterize its further significance in terms of this 'perennial motif of Iranian metaphysics', whilst extremely stimulating is perhaps too forced. Can one really see Zoroastrian as based on such a perennial metaphysical theme of the 'Supreme Divine Being as King of the World'? Whilst such themes do appear in imperial circles that later supported Zoroastrianism, and which gained religious sanctification from Zoroastrianism, this sort of theme is not in my view particularly central or conspicuous in the Zoroastrian revelation. I would consider these imperial motifs used by Buddhist artists on that 'imperial' ground, without claiming that 'perennial Iranian metaphysics' were being revealed. [23] 65</page><page sequence="24">sister, younger sister, daughter in law, without punishment. The reason for no punish? ment is as follows: they held that enjoyment shared with other persons is natural like the shooting sharing of ripe fruit on a tree' (Kasugai 1960: 115). Such a description of the customs of the Iranian magi were mirrored in the Karma-prajn?pati of around the same period. Vasubandhu in his Abhidharma-kosa 68d talked in the 4th-5th century A.D. about the 'amour illicite ne de l'aberration, les Perses, etc. ont commerce avec leur mere et autres femmes interdites'. Bhavya in his Tarkajv?l? commentary of c. 490-570 A.D. considered those incestuosus customs of the Iranian magi as vrata, i.e. 'perverted' (Kawasaki 1975: 14). Hsiian-tsang during his travels from China to India passed through Bactria in c. 630 and described the marriage rites of the Iranian inhabitants of Kapisa as being 'a mere intermingling of the sexes' (1.34), and the marriage customs of Persia (Po-la-sse) as 'merely promiscuous intercourse' (11.20). Such comments would seem to be slightly oblique references to these Iranian incestuous practices. Even as late as the 12th century in Kashmir the R?jatarahgimwas denouncing those same mlecchas of the West who had these pdpin 'sinful' sexual relationships with their sisters- and daughters-in-law (Kasugai 1960: 114). The second Zoroastrian practice that attracted Buddhist criticism was concerning animals. In Zoroastrianism certain animals, called generally khrafstras, like scorpions, snakes, wasps and ants, were considered to be created by the evil Angra Mainyu. Consequently their killing was counted as a meritorious act (Boyce 1975a: 298-301). Bhavya in his Tarkajv?l? commentary seemed to notice, with disapproval, the idea of the Persian maga that 'as they do harm to the earth, killing of ants and others does not go against morality' (Kawasaki 1975: 15). Furthermore among those vrata 'perverted' beliefs of the Persians was that 'by killing bulls and piling their horns one can hope to reach heaven. In the same way, by burning the heart of beasts and with the smoke out of it, one will be born in the highest dwelling place in the utmost heaven, and so on' {ibid). The closest Iranian parallel that comes to mind could be the Zoroastrian sacrificial rites, with particular reference to the great Mihragan ceremony that continued in Iran down to the 19th century (Boyce 1975b) in which the bull was sacrificed. Further Iranian (Zoroastrian?) customs came under Buddhist criticism. The Abhidharma-mah?vibh?s?-s?stra claimed that the 'Maga from the Western regions' held that 'when parents become old and suffer sickness we may cut short their lives without punishment [...] a person who is deceased may suffer but he will be free of the body. This is the reason why it is permitted to kill without punishment' (Kasugai 1960: 115). These sentiments were recorded as well in the Karmaprajn?pati-sastra {ibid.). Such (mercy?) killings were further noted, and rejected, by Vasubandhu in his Abhidharma-kosa 4.68d for 'meurtre ne de l'aberration quand les Perses (parasika) disent "il faut tuer pere et mere ages et malades"'. Greek writers had already described similar traits in Bactria (Strabo, Geography, 11.11.3; Porphiry, Abstinences, 4.21) and Sogdia (Plutarch, Moralia, 328) being found there upon the arrival of Alexander the Great. It is though impossible to say whether any such mercy killings were of 66 [24]</page><page sequence="25">Zoroastrian character, perhaps being an extension of its practice of exposure of the dead; or whether they were derived from a non-Zoroastrian source. Whatever the case may have been, they were not mentioned after Vasubandhu's time by Buddhist writers. Instead in his travels Hsiian-tsang (11.20) contented himself with describing how among the Persians 'when dead their corpses are mostly abandoned'. This range, albeit limited, of Buddhist literature does show that Buddhism did not take an uncritical approach to Iranian society. In India it had not accepted the caste system, and erroneous (in their eyes) practices that clearly breached Buddhist ethical precepts (stlas) were also not accepted. It is for this reason perhaps that Hsiian tsang thought from what he had heard of Persian customs that (11.20) 'in their behaviour they practise neither decorum nor justice'. 5. Iranian Influence on Buddhist Figures So far we have considered fairly conscious Buddhist responses. What will now be considered to bring this study to a close are more unconscious indirect ones. The question here is whether Buddhist figures, most notably Maitreya and Amit?bha, were at least directly or indirectly derived from Iranian ideas and concepts. As we shall see this theme has been a popular one for many writers. It should be emphasized though that any transfer of ideas between religions is particulary difficult to conclusively proof. One can point to similarities between particular traditions, and one can provide the historical and geographical situation for such a transfer to take place. But at the end of the day one is still left with suggestive similarities rather than absolute proof. Consideration of this is coloured by temptations to assume that all similarities between two religions are a result of borrowings, rather than parallel internal developments. This is not to deny the possibility of transfer of ideas between religions, rather this is to advocate a spirit of enquiry that is not divorced from caution. One topic for such discussions has been whether, and if so how much, Maitreya the future Buddha was influenced by (a) Mithra and (b) Zoroastrian ideas about their future saviour and renewer the Saoshyant. Scholars such as Przyluski (1929), Levi (1932), Soper (1949-1950), Lamotte (1958: 775-88), and Dani (1978) have suggested a link between Mithra and Maitreya. This argument has been based on their similar names, their similar epithets of 'Mithra Invictus' and 'Maitreya Ajita', their similar functions as saviour figures, Maitreya's marked regional popularity in the Iranian lands of Central Asia, and Maitreya's earliest appearance in the syncretic milieu of Kushan Gandh?ra where Mithra was known. After reflection though these facts are not so conclusive as might have been initially supposed. It has been rightly questioned (Gordon 1975, Hinnells 1975) how far Mithra's Roman title of 'Mithra Invictus' and character of saviour is really relevant given the fact that they did not particularly apply to the Iranian Mithra. The marked popularity of Maitreya in Central Asia has been well established (Baruch 1948) but [25] 67</page><page sequence="26">he also appeared very early in such a non-Iranian setting as the Pali Digha Nik?ya 3.76. Although interesting cross-religious currents were indeed at play in the Kushan world, it is noticeable how the artistic portrayals of Mithra and Maitreya on Kushan coinage are quite different. On the one hand Mithra was very much the solar deity (MacDowall 1975), while on the other hand Maitreya was shown giving his reassuring hand sign of the abhayamudr? and holding his water flask the kamandalu (Cribb 1980, 1984). Furthermore when Mithra and Maitreya were portrayed (figs. 6, 8) during the 6th-7th century at Bamiyan and Fondukistan their portrayals were totally different, with no signs of iconographic borrowings from Mithra by Maitreya. What their names reveal is a common ancestry rather than cross influences. During the earliest Indo-Iranian days the quality of contractual obligations and friendship had been considered both as an abstract concept and in a personified form of Mithra (Vedic Mitra). Within later Buddhism a similar process took place for Maitreya (lit. child of maitrt) was linguistically the personification of that virtue of maitrt, or 'friendship', which was considered to be one of the 'four Sublime Abodes' which were to be fostered in the Buddhist trainee, as in the Majfhima-Nikdya 1.281 and Sutta Nip?ta 1.8 (Metta suttd). A popular Buddhist practice was to embody and personify spiritual virtues. It is in this light that Maitreya appears, with mastery of the virtue of maitrt, a virtue that indeed had the power of making one invincible (ajita) against evil, as recounted in texts like the Cullavagga 5.5, Lalitavistara 1.6.21 and Mahdvamsa 6.28.30. There has been speculation that Maitreya's role as the future Buddha and renewer of the dharma (as in the Khotanese Book of Zambasta, ch. 22) was influenced in its genesis by the pre-existing Zoroastrian idea of the future Saoshyant. However this alluringly simple proposition ignores weighty internal Buddhist roots. The concept of impermanence and hence change {anicca) was a fundamental plank of Buddhism, and was accepted as applying to the Buddhist preaching of the dharma, which in early Pali sources like the Ahguttara-Nikdya 4.84 was recognized as one that would decline at some future point. Equally well rooted in Buddhism was the idea of successive Buddha's appearing for each eon (kalpa), and S?kyamuni Buddha was seen in Pali sources like the Samyutta-Nikdya 2.104 as being but the twenty-fifth in line of Tath?gatas who had each re-established during their kalpa the decayed dharma. Thus by Buddhist definition through the workings of anicca the dharma would decline at some future point, and equally well another future Buddha would come forth to renew the dharma ? in other words a Maitreya-type figure. Moreover if one actually looks at the Zoroastrian material on the Saoshyant (Boyce 1975: 277-93) and compares it with the Maitreya literature there are no particularly striking common points other than the most general one that they would arise in the future, which is not enough on its own to indicate a cross-religious transference of ideas. A fruitful line of enquiry concerning Iranian influences may perhaps lie with the Pure Land tradition. This was centred around the Buddha Amit?bha 'Infinite Light', otherwise known as Amit?yus 'Infinite Life' whose paradisical Buddha-realm of Sukh?vati 'Happy/Pure Land' lay in the West, and whose earliest literature was the 68 [26]</page><page sequence="27">NI two Fig. 8 - Maitreya, Fondukistan, 7th century. Source Mus&amp;e Guimet. [2 7] 69</page><page sequence="28">Sukh?vati-vy?ha (long and short versions) and Amit?yur-dhy?na (Chinese Kuan-Fo-Ching) s?tras. Later on in China and Japan the Pure Land came to have a marked literal character, to which entry was gained through devotional repetition of Amit?bha's name. However in the earlier Pure Land it was very much based on meditative visualization introspection (Pas 1978). Such concerns were at the very heart of Buddhism, and so one could just consider Amit?bha/Amit?yus to be the particular result of a Mah?y?na proclivity to personify abstract qualities, in this case of Light and time. However certain striking Iranian connections can be suggested which reinforced these Buddhist tendencies. Now it is fact that the translators of the early Pure Land texts into Chinese were dominated in the earlier stages by Iranians from Iran and Central Asia. If we look at the first seven translations into Chinese of the (Larger) Sukh?vati-vy?ha we see that they were made in 148-170 A.D. by An Shih-kao (Parthian), 147-186 by Chih lou chia-ch'ien (Bactrian), 223-253 by Chih ch'ien (Bactrian), with the following translators being K'ang san-khai (Sogdian), Po-yen (Khotanese), Chih fa-hu (of a Bactrian family), who were in turn followed by translators from India, Central Asia, China, Kabul, N. India and C. India (Nanjio 1888: 10-11). Similar patterns took place with the (Shorter) Sukh?vati-vy?ha and Amit?yur-dhy?na s?tras. Artistically this regional flavour could be discerned, with Amit?bha being a popular figure for portrayal in the Tarim basin (Gaulier et al. 1976: 9-10) before appearing later on in China, Tibet and Japan. By contrast he was virtually unknown in India. Only one possible portrayal has been identified of Amit?bha in an Indian setting, that being anyway in the Kushan setting of Mathur? (Huntington 1980). At a general level the particular 'aesthetics of light' that was prevalent in Central Asia, and to some extent Gandh?ra, has already been mentioned. For all Amit?bha's undoubted Buddhist roots (Sangharakshita 1976: 348-78) one cannot help feeling that this process was sharpened or somewhat quickened by Buddhist contact with the Iranian world. Ahura Mazda was well known and described in the Ormazd Yast 16.4-5 and (Iranian) Bundahisn 21.1-7 as being bright and glorious. Interestingly it has been proposed by some that the Iranian figure of Zurvan akarana (Infinite Time) may have played some part in the genesis of Amit?yus (Infinite Life/Age/Time) whom he predated by many centuries, and whom was mentioned in Sogdian Buddhist texts as we have discussed earlier under the rendering of zrw\ By careful analysis of particular texts Tucci (1974) has plausibly argued for some real Zurvanite influence in some Tibetan Buddhist circles. Whether any such Zurvanite influence was at play in Buddhist circles of Central Asia or Iran is at present impossible to say. We do indeed need to be cautious over such speculation. Mallmann's approach in 1948 to reconstruct an Iranian-derived triad of Avalokitesvara, Amit?bha and Mah?sthamapr?pta was rightly demolished (Tucci 1948-1951, Filliozat 1950, Conze 1975) because of her faulty linguistic base and unwarranted sweeping ultimately groundless speculations. Despite this precautionary example, there still remains a residue 70 [28]</page><page sequence="29">of probable, even if indeterminate, Iranian influences at play in the early development of Amit?bha alongside his clear Buddhist origins. A final Buddhist figure to consider for Iranian influences is Ksitigarbha. This Bodhisattva was unknown as far as we know in India, but in contrast was extremely popular at Khotan (Williams 1973: 131-32) and other parts of the Tarim basin (Gaulier et al. 1976: 14, fig. 67), from where he passed into China to enjoy a more modest popularity. He was seen as the conductor of dead 'souls' whom he, dressed as a monk, helped steer away from evil. To some extent this role bears comparison with that of the Zoroastrian figure Sraosha, who after death was also the close guide and friend of the righteous person (Zaehner 1961: 302-5). Bound up with the existing character of Sraosha was the peculiar Zoroastrian theme of the Chinvat bridge. Stemming from very archaic Iranian roots the Chinvat bridge was the connecting place between the earthly and heavenly spheres, and the place according to texts like the Sraosha Yast and Bundahisn where the dead soul was accompanied by Sraosha to receive their judgement (Boyce 1975a: 236-40, Eliade 1979: 328-31). In Buddhism the bridge was not a particularly used motif, and so it is all the more suggestive to find Ksitigarbha at Tun-huang portrayed by a bridge linking his paradisical realm to the lower infernal regions, and Ksitigarbha shown interceding with the judges of hell (Bussagli 1978: ill. p. 117). As can be seen from the previous sections on figures like Maitreya, Amit?bha and Ksitigarbha, when dealing with Iranian influences we have to combine a rigorous sifting of evidence with an openness towards there being possible outside influences. In a similar way there must be a sensitive and thorough evaluation of internal Buddhist developments and external Iranian religious strands, conducted against a background of historical feasibility for any such postulated transference of ideas, be they at the conscious or unconscious level, be they directly or indirectly. At the end of such an examination we are left with a sense of Iranian involvement in the early evolution of such figures, though not necessarily with their original genesis which can be rooted in Buddhist context. If we take this situation one step further back though another Iranian facet presents itself. Geographically these Buddhist figures arose within Iranian (including Kushan) areas. In regard to the whole question about the origins of the Bodhisattva theme Basham (1984) while pointing out Iranian parallels sees their genesis as arising from internal Buddhist premises in Kushan North West India. As he cogently put it 'Thus it would be wrong to look on either doctrine (Maitreya and heavenly Bodhisattvas) as deliberately borrowed from Zoroastrianism or any other branch of Iranian religion. A more feasible interpretation of the data would be that the spread of Iranian influences in the northwestern part of the subcontinent prepared the ground for these doctrines by encouraging among the people at large certain attitudes [...]' (p. 43). Iranian influences can therefore be postulated on such Buddhist figures in this sense of having prepared the way and ensured a greater receptivity among the people, to the subsequent Buddhist generated theme, which was though in its following [29] 71</page><page sequence="30">early elaboration in Iranian areas reinforced and coloured by this Iranian outlook. As always though analysis of the transference of ideas remains an inherently difficult task. Conclusion At this point we bring this study to an interim close. What has hopefully been achieved is a demonstration that Buddhism did respond in various ways and in various fields to the Iranian environment in which it found itself on emerging from its Indian geographical and cultural cocoon. It is worth stressing the fact that this Iranian world was encountered by.Buddhism before it made its way into Tibet and China. Throughout this study the term Buddhism has been used instead of schools of Buddhism. Certainly the differences between Mah?y?na and Hinay?na (e.g. Sarv?stav?din) groups should not be ignored. Furthermore our range of material is of a scattered type. Nevertheless at the end of the day a coherent Buddhist approach does seem to have emerged transcending the difference between schools of Buddhism. With Buddhism's disposition to adopt suitable functional themes from newly en? countered settings, it was well placed to integrate various Iranian deities, terms, artistic patterns, customs, and concepts into a Buddhist presentation. By use of the (Iranian) familiar the (Buddhist) unfamiliar could be presented. The fact that this sort of functional adoption was seen over such a scattered range of material indicates a continuing pattern at work. We do not need to postulate organized or even deliberate Buddhist deliberations over this process of suitable functional adoptions. Instead it shows itself more as a fairly natural process based on Buddhist principles. We should not overestimate the extent of these adoptions and adaptations of Iranian themes, for from the material at hand (and this could change in the future) they did not overwhelm the strong continuing Indian element. One cannot quite talk about an Tranization' of Buddhism in the sense that one can talk about the 'Sinification' of Buddhism in China. Nevertheless Buddhism did make its message, and criticism, in a variety of ways with due regard to its Iranian environment. The picture painted here is though an incomplete one for we are still dependant for the moment on a limited range of extant literature and archaeological finds. Three avenues suggest themselves for the future analysis of Iranian Buddhism. First is archaeology. It would be of great interest to have archaeological material from the Iranian plateau, and such types of Buddhist finds were beginning to be revealed in recent years (Ball 1976, Hasuri 1978). However the present political conditions in Iran render archaeological excavations virtually impossible. That is more the pity since in that area any Buddhist material found could give valuable insights on the characteristics of Buddhism in that strongly Zoroastrian atmosphere then prevalent. The present troubles in Afghanistan, and the restricted access to the Tarim basin have also reduced the prospects for new East Iranian material emerging. In respect of the latter it should be noted that not all of the vast range of Buddhist material (especially 72 [30]</page><page sequence="31">literature) found at the start of the century in the Tarim basin has been published and evaluated. Soviet Central Asia remains an ever more developing archaeological field to which we can look with anticipation and hope, particulary in the Buddhist stronghold of N. Bactria (southern Tajik/Uzbek SSRs). A second line of approach in trying to discern Iranian Buddhism would be a thorough study of the range of early Chinese Buddhist literature, for in fact during the lst-3rd centuries A.D. it was Iranian translators rather than Indians who were responsible for that range of early Chinese Buddhist literature. We have a large number of Chinese texts still extant that are the work of Parthian, Sogdian and Bactrian ('Kushan') translators (Z?rcher 1972: 18-36, 46-55). If systematic publication and analysis were undertaken of this corpus of works, with a rigorous separation of Indian and Chinese elements, we might well be able to sift out something of the characteristics of the Iranian Buddhist background of those translators. A third line of approach lies in the extensive records by early Islamic writers who in Iran, Bactria and Sogdia were actually faced with Buddhist communities. Melikian Chirvani (1974, 1984) has already started to analyse and disseminate this rather overlooked but increasingly valuable source. We can look forward to further use being made of this avenue. It is then with interest that we can look forward to future developments in the field of Iranian Buddhist studies. For the moment the main lines of enquiry and materials have been presented here to show something of Buddhist responses to its Iranian environment. In short, something of the Iranian face of Buddhism. BIBLIOGRAPHY Al'bauni, A. (1978) Grifon iz Fajaz-tepe. Istorija i Arheologija Srednei Azii, pp. 60-67. Ashabad. Asmussen, J.P. (1956) Xuastvanift.
