<plain_text><page sequence="1">ANAXIMANDER, THE FIRST METAPHYSICIAN Anaximander of Miletus1 was the first metaphysician,2 and an important one. Son of Praxiades, he was born B.C. 610 and died c.B.C. 545. As a citizen of Miletus he was suffi ciently distinguished 3 to be chosen leader of a colony sent to Apollonia. As a scientist he is said (although on questionable authority) to have invented the gnomon, made clocks, made the first map of the earth,4 and made a celestial sphere. He is usually said to have been a pupil of the famous Wise Man Tha?es.5 1 The sources for the study of Anaximander are collected in H. Diels, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, 5th ed., vol. 1 (Berlin, 1934), sec. 12 (pp. 81-90). In the absence of the scarce fifth edition, the earlier editions will be found to include the same material. 2 I call him the first with three qualifications: (1) This means the first known to us, not the first who existed; doubtless there were many earlier ones whose fame has been lost. (2) It means first among the Greeks; no comparison with oriental thinkers is intended. (3) It means metaphy sician in the technical sense; we know of earlier Greek philosophers ? philosophical poets such as Hesiod, religious teachers such as Orpheus, and popular philosophers such as the Seven Wise Men. 3 A sixth century statue of Anaximander ( or else another man o? the same name) has been excavated at Miletus. In its present condition it has little value as a work of art and none as evidence of its subject's appearance. For a photograph, see Wiegand, Milet, heft 2, p. 112. 4 Superseded by the improved map of Hekataeus. Anaximander had no problem of projection, as he believed the earth to be flat. 5 Tha?es of Miletus is among the most overrated figures in the history of philosophy. His fame as the founder of philosophy seems to rest entirely on the fact that Aristotle calls him the founder of materialism and mentions him first among the physicists whose theories are cited at the beginning of the Metaphysics. But Aristotle was not writing a history of philosophy; he was discussing a particular problem. Diogenes Laertios, who did write a history of philosophy, calls Anaximander and Pythagoras the founders of the Ionian and Italian schools of philosophy respectively, and Tha?es and Pherecydes their predecessors as being their teachers, not as being them selves philosophers. The most interesting story about Tha?es is that, by the aid of his scientific wisdom, he made a large profit by cornering the oil market, thus demonstrating once for all, as Aristotle says, "that philosophers can easily be rich if they like, but that their ambition is of another sort." But even [137]</page><page sequence="2">138 George Bos worth Burch (Note 5 continued) if the truth of the story be conceded, the moral would follow only if Tha?es could be shown to be a philosopher from independent evidence, and this cannot easiy be done. The most plausible evidence of his wisdom is that he is said to have advised the Ionian cities to unite in a federal state. This was surely wise advice and proves, if the story is true, that Tha?es possessed political wisdom like the others of the Seven Wise Men with whom he was traditionally associated, differing from all the others however in that they were success ful statesmen whereas his advice was ignored. We can conclude that Tha?es was probably a wise statesman, but this would not justify considering him a philosopher in the technical sense, any more than the other six, who are never called philosophers. His fame in applied science rests on his having diverted the river Halys to enable the Lydian army to cross *? a not inconsiderable feat. But our only source for this incident is Herodotus, and Herodotus adds that he himself does not believe a word of it (and gives his reason, that there was a bridge). The rejection of the story by its only source cannot but dampen our enthusiasm for believing it. The favorite Tha?es story, repeated by all historians of philosophy, is that he predicted a total eclipse of the sun which stopped a battle between the Medes and the Lydians. It is a favorite because the historian, instead of merely copying what his predecessors have written, can question his astro nomical colleague about the eclipse and so give a scientific confirmation of history. The answer is that there was a total eclipse of the sun in that region May 28, B.C. 585. There can be no question that this eclipse occurred, and if Herodotus says it stopped a battle there is no good reason to doubt that it did. The question is whether Tha?es predicted it. Again our only source is Herodotus, and all he actually says is that Tha?es foretold "the very year in which it actually took place." Now to predict the year of a total eclipse is no very great achievement, in view of the fact that such eclipses occur almost every year; the trick is to predict the exact time and place. If Herodotus had reason to believe that Tha?es actually did so, it is strange that he would have recounted the event in a way which omits the essence of the story. Thales's fame as a mathematician has grown through the ages, and reached what is so far its highest point when Allman (Greek Geometry from Tha?es to Euclid, 1889) called him the founder of algebra. Most writers have been satisfied to expand on his achievements in geometry. When these claims are traced back to their ancient sources, they seem to have evolved from one original story to the effect that Tha?es taught the Egyp tians a solution of their problem of how to find the height of a pyramid. His ingenious solution was: wait until a time when a man's shadow is exactly the same length as the man's height, and the pyramid's shadow will then be exactly the same length as the pyramid's height. This evidence of Thales's genius has been repeated by many historians of philosophy. For ex</page><page sequence="3">Anaximander, the First Metaphysician 139 (Note 5 continued) ample, Gomperz, in his Greek Thinkers, says: "We may readily credit the tradition that Tha?es supplied his Egyptian masters with the method they had sought in vain of computing the height of the towering pyramids which are the wonders of their home. He pointed out to them that at the time of day when a man's shadow ? or that of any other object presenting no difficulty to mensuration *? is exactly equal to the size of the original, then, too, the shadow of the pyramid can neither be longer nor shorter than its actual height." More recently Jeans, in his Growth of Physical Science (1948), explains the method and adds, "If this was all, Tha?es may not have been acquainted with the more general proposition, nor even with the rather difficult idea of proportionality" ? evidently worrying as to whether Tha?es knew geometry in general or only this one rule. Hegel, rather more perti nently, remarks, " If this were something new to the Egyptians, they must have been very far back in the theory of geometry." But none of these historians seems to have noticed that the whole story is only a joke of the same type as the rule to catch a bird by putting salt on its tail. The for mula would undoubtedly give the correct height of the pyramid if it could be applied; but it would be necessary to measure the shadow from its apex to the center of the pyramid, which is obviously impossible; in fact a pyra mid with a 45? slope (and the Egyptian pyramids are nearly that) casts no shadow at all under the circumstances required by the rule. His known contributions to psychological science consist of the two opinions, vouched for by Aristotle, that "all things are full of gods" and that "the magnet has a soul because it moves the iron." The former seems to be merely a statement of the primitive animism generally accepted by the ancient Greeks; at least, no more profound meaning can be inferred from the text. The latter is either a statement of a well known fact (that mag nets attract iron) or else an illustration of the former proposition's animism (the attraction being explained by the god in the magnet) ~~ although, if preferred, it can be taken as a refutation of animism, since there is some logic in Burnet's comment that to say the magnet is alive "is to imply, if anything, that other things are not." In the absence of the context it is impossible to find any clear meaning, let alone any profound philosophy, in these fragments. We come finally to the famous dictum that water is the source ( ?pXr? ) ?f a^ things. Taken literally, without any interpretation, this is mere nonsense (unless we follow Russell's suggestion, in his History of Western Philosophy, that, since all things are made of hydrogen, which is two thirds of water, Thaies was two thirds right ? and the devo tion of the first lecture to this theory has doubtless discouraged more than one student from taking Phil. 1. Presumably Tha?es meant something; but what ? Aristotle did not know, and no discoveries made since his time have thrown any light on the mystery. Almost every historian of philosophy has endeavored to explain what Tha?es meant, and since there is no evidence bearing on the subject there are no restrictions on the hypotheses which can</page><page sequence="4">140 George Bos worth Burch Anaximander wrote a book which was catalogued by the librarians of Alexandria under the title Tl?pi &amp;vae?)&lt;; ? the first of many books so called. It is the first known philo sophical work, in fact the first known prose work, in Greek.6 Of this book only one sentence is extant: "Into that from which beings have their origin they also have their passing away, by necessity; for they render to each other retribution and atone ment for their injustice in the order of time." 7 But numerous references from reliable ancient sources enable us to recon (Note 5 continued) be framed. Aristotle himself suggested that Tha?es based his statement on the importance of water in biological phenomena, "perhaps." Burnet argues that Tha?es had meteorological, rather than biological, phenomena in mind. Fuller explains it by saying he had in mind, "probably," the obvious transformations of water into gaseous and solid forms and "stretched his imagination to suppose a further alteration of water into the manifold and diverse kinds" of things (but withdraws this in a later work in favor of the statement that all the hypotheses are "only conjectures"). Windelband finds the secret in the fact that liquids, unlike solids, "make the impression of independent mobility and vitality." Hegel interprets Tha?es as "com prehending essence as devoid of form," and explains this by the fact thai water "has not got a sensuous universality, but a speculative one merely." These theories do great credit to the metaphysical ingenuity of their authors, but they throw no light at all on the purely historical question of what Tha?es himself taught; as Zeller says, "It is difficult for us to come to any definite conclusion on the subject." While we may concede that Tha?es did teach that water is the source of all things and that he did mean some thing by this, we must also conclude that it is impossible to know what he meant and that there is no reason to suppose that what he meant was very profound. Since Tha?es wrote no book, any influence he may have exerted must have been through oral teaching. The only person who has ever been called his pupil is Anaximander, and there is nothing in any of the doc trines of Anaximander which remotely suggests any of the teachings attri buted to Tha?es. 6 This claim can be disputed in favor of the book of Pherecydes, but the date of Pherecydes is unknown and he cannot be shown to be priot to Anaximander. The scanty fragments of his book do not permit a recon struction of his doctrine, but they indicate that it was allegorical myth rather than technical philosophy. 7 i$ S)v 8?

Anaximander contributed to philosophy eight important concepts. Four are metaphysical; one is ethical; two are cosmo logical; and one is psychological.8 ( 1 )9 Anaximander introduced into philosophy the concept of God in the philosophical sense. Since God is the ultimate reality, with which metaphysics is primarily concerned, this can be considered the most basic concept of metaphysics, and its introduction can be considered the beginning of the history of metaphysics.10 For God Anaximander did not use the word # o?, which in the sixth century would mean a god in the polytheistic sense, but the adjective deiov, literally "divine," preceded by the definite article to make it a substantive, and put in the neuter gender to indicate a metaphysical rather than a personal entity. There is no exact English equivalent for to deiov; it corresponds to the neuter "Brahma" of Hindu philosophy. Our knowledge of Anaximander's use of this concept is based exclusively on Aristotle's statement, "The Source has no source, but is itself, it would seem, the source of other things and encompasses all things and directs all things, as they say who do not posit other causes, such as mind or love, besides the indefinite; the latter being the divine, for it is im mortal and indestructible, as Anaximander and most of the physicists say." n The passage has a certain ambiguity: it is 81 say nothing of his biological doctrines. They have often been represented as an anticipation of the theory of evolution. This may be right, but the sources for bis biological theories are so incomplete that it seems impossible to determine what, if anything, he did teach about evolution. 9 Source for this section: Diels, Frag, der Vors. (5th ed., vol. 1) 12 A 15. 10 Werner Jaeger (Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers, p. 31) asserts, "The concept of the Divine as such does not appear before Anax imander," and remarks, "This expression is of epoch-making importance in Greek philosophy." il ov TavTrjs ?pxrf* ???' avrrj t&lt;ov olAAcdv ctrat SoKei Kal irtpii\ iv airavra Kal iravra Kv?epvav* &lt;w? &lt;f&gt;aoriv ocroi firj ttolovui irap? to airtipov aA?a? cunas olov vovv r? &lt;f&gt;i\?av? kclItovt' c?vat to Qe?ov* ?OdvaTOV y?p Kal ?v&lt;*&gt;\eOpovi a&gt;? tfracrw o Ava?ifxav8po&lt;; Kal ol ttX?cttol tiov &lt;?&gt;vaio\oyoiv (Phys. 203b).</page><page sequence="6">142 George Bos worth Burch not obvious whether the clause, "As Anaximander and most of the physicists say," is intended to cover the whole sentence, "The latter being the divine, for it is immortal and indestruct ible," or merely the final part of it, "For it is immortal and in destructible." In the second case, "The latter being the divine," would be Aristotle's own remark and not attributed to Anaxi mander. Either interpretation is possible grammatically, but the second is impossible historically. In Aristotle's philosophy the indefinite (matter) is just the opposite of the divine (form),12 and so the remark that the indefinite is the divine cannot be a gloss by Aristotle. It must, therefore, be part of the quotation from Anaximander.13 (2)14 Anaximander described God by the phrase the indefinite to direLpov), and so introduced into Greek philoso phy 15 the way of thinking of God as transcending all concepts. The references include certain synonyms for arreipov : a&amp;iov (eternal), ayqpc? (unaging), airipavTov (infinite), aopiaTOv (indeterminate). It will be noticed that all except one of these adjectives are negative; the only positive attribute of God is eternal. There has been some controversy as to whether aireipov is to be interpreted as meaning qualitatively indefinite or quan titatively infinite. A third hypothesis was proposed by Paul Tannery,16 who derived air&amp;pov from ire?pa (experience) instead of ire?pap (end), and so translated it unperceived.11 12 Cf. Phys. 207b. 13 This is questioned, however, by Praechter (Ueberweg, Grundriss der Gesch. der Phil, Pt. I, 12th ed., p. 46). i* Sources: Diels 12 A 1, 9, 9a, 11, 14, 15, B 2, 3. 15 It is found earlier in Sanskrit literature. For a discussion of the use of the analogous word aditi in the much more ancient Samhita of the Rig Veda, see Max M?ller, Vedic Hymns, Part I (Sacred Books of the East, Vol. 32), pp. 241-263. 16 Rev. de Phil., 4 (1904), pp. 703-707 (Mem. Sc, vol. 7, pp. 309-314). 17 This Kantian interpretation is ingenious, but there is no historical evidence for attributing it to Anaximander. Other proposed hypotheses identify the wirupov with the Orphic AW aweipoc and so perhaps make it mean temporally unending (R. Eisler, Weltenmantel, 11, 666; cf. Corn ford, From Religion to Philosophy, p. 146) or interpret it as indefinite neither</page><page sequence="7">Anaximander, the First Metaphysician 143 Insofar as these interpretations are equivalent, the issue at stake is not very great. If the deity is qualitatively indefinite, it is presumably also quantitatively infinite at least in a negative sense, since only something definite can have a boundary. This is suggested by the reference which calls it "indeterminate both in form and in size" (a?pLcrTov teal kolt e?So? Kal Kara fteycoo?). And if it is indefinite, it is presumably imperceptible. The only view inconsistent with the interpretation of air&amp;pov as indefinite is the theory that it means quantitatively infinite only and that to aireipov consequently means infinite space. This theory is maintained by Burnet,18 who defends it by three arguments: (1) the aireipov is said to encompass {irepi?xeiv) all the worlds; (2) Aristotle 19 calls it a body (co?fia dwetpov) ; (3) Anaximenes adapted the theory to air. None of these arguments seems very impressive. Convincing evidence that Anaximander did not mean spatially infinite only, but meant qualitatively indefinite also, is found in the statement of Theo phrastus20 that Anaximenes agreed with Anaximander in calling the underlying nature (ttjv viroKeifievriv &lt;f)vaLv) one (jiiav)and infinite(fcat direipov) but did not agree with him in calling it indefinite (??pioT0i&gt;) but rather considered it definite (?)pio-fi V7)v\ since he called it air.21 Whatever ambiguity there may be about 7reipov, there i$ no ambiguity about the prefix a. Whatever Tretpov may mean, Anaximander's God does not have it. Apparently it means any definable attribute whatever. This un-Platonic and un-Aristotelian theology is quite foreign to classical Greek thought, but reappears in the "negative theology" of the Chris tian writers of the patristic period, most explicitly in the works attributed to Dionysius the Areopagite. Thus the fundamental in extent nor in essence but only in the sense of being homogeneous (Guyot, Rev. de Phil, 4 (1904), pp. 708-715). is Early Gr. Ph., p. 58.

(3)22 Anaximander introduced the concept of emanation to explain the origin of the universe and its relation to God. His word for this is ?iTQKpivecrdai (literally, to separate from), with a variant itcKpiveadai (to separate out of). The universe of things comes into being by emanation (liter ally, separation) from the indefinite. This emanation is due to an "eternal motion" {Kivna'iv a?Siov) &gt;-* a phrase which seems to indicate the activity of the dynamic (KLvovfjievov) indefinite. The immediate product of emanation (and so source of all other things) is described as "the opposites' (r5&gt;v ivavTi v), that is, contrasted qualities. These "opposites" include hot and cold, the first distinction in Anaximander's cosmogony; what other qualities, if any, emanate immediately from the indefinite is not clear. This speculation concerning the origin of all things out of the indefinite (which is not a thing or kind of thing) must not be confused with speculation concerning the origin of one kind of thing out of another. The latter is physics; the former, metaphysics. Anaximenes proposed the physical theory that one kind of thing is produced from another by condensation or rarefaction, but he had no metaphysical theory concerning the origin of the first things. Anaximander's book contained physics also, but it was expressed in terms of qualities (like Aristotle) rather than density (like Anaximenes and modern science). He seems to have taught that the original "hot" sur rounded the earth "as bark surrounds a tree" and then broke up into rings which became the sun, moon, and stars; while the "cold" became the sea, which partly evaporated to become air and partly dried up to become land. The sources for this speculation, however, are so brief, obscure, and unreliable that it is impossible to reconstruct Anaximander's physics or cosmo gony 23 with any confidence. 22 Sources: Diels 12 A 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17, 17a, 27; Diels 13 A 5. 23 We must distinguish his physical cosmogony, theory of the for mation of the ordered universe out of the definite elements or qualities from which it arose, from his metaphysical theory of the origin of these elements themselves by emanation from the indefinite.</page><page sequence="9">Anaximander, the First Metaphysician 145 The metaphysical theory of emanation, as a solution of the problem of the origin of the world, is opposed to the rival metaphysical theory of ordering, usually attributed to Anaxa goras and Plato, according to which God creates the world by imposing order on a preexisting chaotic matter. According to the latter theory, before the creative event there exist two prin ciples, God and chaos.24 According to the theory of emanation, before the event of emanation there exists only God ( the inde finite ) , and therefore he is the sole cause (rr/v iraaav atrtav), both sufficient and necessary, of the universe. The theory of emanation is also opposed to the primitive theory, found in Hesiod's Theogony, of the evolution of the universe out of chaos. The latter theory agrees with the theory of emanation in teaching that before the event there exists only one principle, namely chaos, which might seem to be indistin guishable from Anaximander's indefinite. But the two theories disagree radically in that for Hesiod chaos is transformed into cosmos, so that there is no more chaos after the universe has evolved, whereas for Anaximander the indefinite is nowise destroyed or even decreased by the emanation of the universe from it. Emanation is not a physical process, and the physical law of conservation does not apply to it. Anaximander taught that the indefinite is also infinite ( CLir?pavT?v cotci&gt;) and that it must be so in order that the generation of things may not fail (?XXewr^.It continues to exist, undiminished, and to encompass {TT pi?)(eiv) and rule (Kv?epvapy literally "steer") the uni verse (airavra). The theory of emanation should probably also be opposed to the Augustinian doctrine of creation ex nihilo, although the distinction is elusive; for both theories, before the event God alone exists, and after the event God exists unchanged along with a world which owes its existence to him.25 24 Aristotle's metaphysics also, although involving no beginning of the world, is logically analogous to this, with potency playing the role of chaos. 25 According to Erigena, the doctrine that God made the world out of nothing means that he made it out of himself, since he is nothing (Pat. Lat. 122, 680D, 683B).</page><page sequence="10">146 George Bos worth Burch Very similar to Anaximander's doctrine, however, is Plo tinus's theory of the origin of all things by emanation from the ineffable One 26 which transcends all definite ideas. Both in its intrinsic nature and in its relation to the universe, Plo tinus's One seems to be indistinguishable from Anaximander's indefinite. It is the eternal and indefinable God from which all things arise by emanation and to which (as we shall see) all things tend to return. The final formulation of classical Greek philosophy by the last pagan philosopher is based on the same concept of emanation taught by Anaximander. In Plotinus Greek philosophy, enriched by the works of Plato and Aristotle, returned to the basic doctrine (rejected by them) of its founder. (4)27 Anaximander also taught that all things revert to (literally, "have their destruction into") the indefinite deity from which they emanate, thus completing his theory of emana tion by an eschatological doctrine unusual in classical Greek philosophy. While Plato and Aristotle taught that all things, in some sense, seek God, Anaximander taught that all things actually return to God. Since this source to which they return is the indefinite, their return is their destruction, just as their emanation is their production. It follows that all things, and the world as a whole, are perishable (&lt;f&gt;dapTov tov ko&amp;iiov). This doctrine suggests a theory of cosmic cycles, and, according to a statement in the Stromateis attributed to Plu tarch, this is what Anaximander taught. The indefinite is the sole cause not only of generation but also of destruction. "From it emanated {airoKeKpio'dai) the heavens and in general all the worlds, which are infinite {tovs ?iravTa? ane?povs (Was Koa/JLOVC)." This infinite series of worlds would seem to mean a temporal succession of cosmic cycles ? although Burnet, who needs an infinite number of worlds to fill the infinite space he attributes to Anaximander, interprets it as meaning an infinite number of coexisting universes which we see as the stars. The Plutarchian fragment continues: "He declared that destruction 26 Anaximander also called the indefinite "one" (cv or /u-tav). 27 Sources: Diels 12 A 10, 17, B 1.</page><page sequence="11">Anaximander, the First Metaphysician 147 (tt?v &lt;f&gt;0op?v) and, long before ( ir?Xv irpoTepov ) [that is, presumably, in each cycle], generation ( ttjv y?ve&amp;iv ) have taken place {yiveo'dai) since an indefinite time (ef direLpov atawoc), all these being cyclical (?vaKVKXovfxevo?v irdvT&amp;v avTtov)." This might mean that the universe as a whole is des troyed, and then, after an intervening period during which nothing but the indefinite exists, a new universe emanates, to be destroyed in its turn, and so on forever. Or it might mean that some things emanate while others are destroyed, so that some things are always in existence. The appearance in Anaximan der's book of the cosmogonie doctrine mentioned above, even though its details cannot be reconstructed, would seem to sup port the former interpretation, and so to justify us in attributing to Anaximander a doctrine of cycles. The only clue to the duration of the cycle is the vague phrase "long before." There is a striking similarity between the metaphysics of Anaximander's book, as reconstructed from the references, and that of John Scotus Erigena's De Divisione Naturae, although Anaximander presents only the fundamental principles of the system, while Erigena develops it in great detail. This compa rison is especially interesting in view of the positions of these two authors in the history of philosophy. Anaximander, the first metaphysician, stands at the beginning of ancient western philosophy. Erigena stands at the end. His book, a systematic synthesis of the most profound insights of the philosophers, both Greek and Latin, both pagan and Christian, of the preceding fifteen centuries, terminates the epoch of ancient philosophy, an epoch dominated by an interest in metaphysics. (He is fol lowed by the philosophically sterile tenth century, and then by the new epoch of medieval and modern philosophy, dominated not so much by metaphysics as by epistemology). The outline of principles around which Erigena's vast synthesis is con structed is exactly the doctrine of Anaximander: 28 God, defin able only as being undefinable, the source from which all things come into being and into which they are reabsorbed. The first 28 Not, of course, that there was any direct influence.</page><page sequence="12">148 George Bosworth Burch book of ancient philosophy was a first draft of that book which was to be the final and full summary of ancient philosophy.29 (5)30 Anaximander introduced into Greek philosophy the concept of natural law. This is found in the one extant sentence from his book, quoted above, in which he explains the reason why all things which come into existence must also, "by neces sity," pass out of existence, returning into the indefinite from which they emanate: "For they render to each other 81 retri bution and atonement for their injustice in the order of time." We usually think of the word law as having two mean ings, descriptive scientific law and prescriptive moral or legal law ? meanings so distinct that the word is a perfect homonym. Anaximander has a primitive concept of law in which these meanings are not yet differentiated. The law of the destruction of all things by return into their source is descriptive and scien tific in that it applies universally and inevitably. But it is moral in that it is based on the fact of a moral vice, "injustice" (r?j* a8t#aa?\which deserves punishment, "retribution and atone ment" (8lk7?v kolI T?ariv). The meaning seems to be that existence as a definite being is itself unjust. We are encroaching on each other by our ex 29 There is a striking parallel between the history of ancient philoso phy in Europe and in India. The earliest statement of the Vedanta philoso phy is in the Upanishads, the oldest known Hindu metaphysical books, which are more or less contemporary with Anaximander, and the doctrine of which is very much like that of Anaximander. The most fully developed statement of the Vedanta philosophy is in the writings of Shankara, who is approximately contemporary with Erigena, and whose system is very like his. There seems, however, to be no demonstrable influence of either of these developments on the other, although perhaps this problem has not been sufficiently studied. 30 Source: Diels 12 B 1. 81 There is an interesting variant reading in this crucial sentence from Anaximander's book. The first edition omits the word aWr?\ois ("to each other"). The editors of the later editions have inserted the word as being supported by the best manuscripts. While the emendation is pre sumably correct, it seems exaggerated to suggest (as Burnet does) that it makes a scientific theory out of what, without the emendation, was a "fanciful interpretation." Without aAA.17A.otc, the sentence would seem to mean that existence is a crime; with it, that existence is a tort.</page><page sequence="13">Anaximander*, the First Metaphysician 149 istence. Injustice is lacking only in the eternal indefinite. "In the order of time" (/car? tt/p tov ^p?vov Tafii&gt;), that is, in the temporal world of definite beings, we compete for place. This unjust encroachment calls for retribution. We can atone for our coming into existence only by passing out of existence again, and the eternal law assures that we do so. This concept of natural law is quite different from the Homeric concept of destiny, an arbitrary or at least inscrutable fate different for different beings; Anaximander's law is uni versal, intelligible, and eminently just ? coming into being must be made up for by its exact equivalent, passing out of being. It is radically different from the Christian concept of original sin, according to which injustice, far from requiring, actually prevents the return of the creature to its source. It is like the Hindu principle of karma in that it combines scientific and moral law in a single concept. It is reminiscent of the Buddhist doctrine that all existence is suffering, but differs from this in two ways: while both Buddhism and Anaximander disapprove of existence, the former does so on hedonistic grounds, the latter on strictly moral grounds;32 and Buddhism denies the inevitability, though not the desirability, of our eventual non-existence. This ethical doctrine sounds strange today, when we hear so much about our alleged natural rights. According to Anaximander the only right we have is the right to perish. Nobody and nothing has a natural right even to exist. Existence is a wrong, and it must be atoned for. To be ourselves is an offense against our fellow beings; to lose ourselves in God is our natural right and our common destiny. (6)83 Anaximander founded scientific cosmology by his theory that the earth is a heavenly body (tt?v Se yr\v c?vat lier? pov). There have been, in the history of science, four principal theories of cosmology. The oldest, already established at the 82 Vedanta disapproves of individual existence on scientific grounds, as being illusion. 33 Sources: Diels 12 A 10, 11, 26, B 5.</page><page sequence="14">150 George Bos worth Burch beginning of history, is the common sense view which regards the earth as a fixed body, firmly supported (although on what, was always a moot question ), with a flat surface, and covered by the dome of the sky. The stars are thought of as lights on the sky or as holes through which a supercelestial light is seen. The sun moves across the sky every day and returns to the east by night, passing either below the ground (the Egyptian theory) or above the sky (the Babylonian theory) ?* thereby giving those regions their fair share of illumination. Such a cos mology, however primitive, is quite compatible with a consider able amount of detailed astronomical knowledge, as seen in the quite advanced astronomical science of the Babylonians. The second cosmology is that which, while still thinking of space in terms of absolute directions up and down, frees the earth from its support and conceives it as a heavenly body existing unsup ported in space just like the other heavenly bodies. The sky ceases to be thought of as a hemispherical firmament and be comes an imaginary celestial sphere on which we project the heavenly bodies which really exist at different distances.34 The third cosmology is that which makes the earth a sphere, places it at the center of the universe, and defines "down" as toward this center. The fourth and still current cosmology is that which describes the spherical earth as itself moving, and so explains the apparent motion of the other heavenly bodies as being partly due to the actual motion of the earth from which they are observed.35 The passage from one of these cosmologies to the next is an act of genius requiring the rejection of established com mon sense and the introduction of a new category of thought. These three steps are the great events in the history of cosmo logy and, since cosmology is concerned with the nature of the universe and man's place in it, among the most important events 34 There is logic, whether or not historical truth, in the tradition according to which Anaximander, the founder of this cosmological theory, made the first model of the celestial sphere. It is possible that the con struction of the model may have led him to the theory. 85 The contemporary views associated with the theory of relativity might be added as a fifth cosmology.</page><page sequence="15">Anaximander, the First Metaphysician 151 in the whole history of science. The first step, involving the greatest break with common sense, was the most difficult. This first step was taken by Anaximander.36 Both Aristotle and Hippolytus attribute it to him, and nobody attributes it to any earlier thinker. Even Tha?es held to a variant of the primi tive cosmology, if Aristotle is right in saying he taught that the earth floats on water. In order to attain this insight Anaxi mander had to repudiate the evidence of the senses, which show us the solid earth fixed below and the heavenly bodies moving over the surface of the sky above ? to say nothing of religious dogmas which had from time immemorial been formu lated in terms of this cosmology. He had to do violence to that egocentric form of intuition which builds the universe around the observer, and progressive emancipation from which makes up the progress of science. Anaximander did not, however, free himself from the intuition of absolute up and down. This second step, associated with the theory that the earth is a sphere, followed soon after, being first taught, so far as we know, by the Pythagoreans. This step involved the paradox that "down" is toward the center of the earth, and therefore that the direc tion which is down for one person may be up for another. The third step, with its final offense to common sense, was the passage to the theory that the spherical earth itself moves, and so that not only is the direction down relative to a center of attraction but this center itself is not fixed. This theory was first proposed in the Pythagorean school in connection with the hypothesis of a central fire as the center of the earth's revolution. As this ingenious hypothesis did not prove useful, scientists, notably Aristotle, reverted to the third cosmology, that is the geocentric theory, in terms of which the astronomer Eudoxus had given a mathematical analysis of planetary mo tion. The heliocentric form of the fourth cosmology was pro posed by Aristarchus. In spite of his cogent arguments for it, 36 It must be conceded that Anaximander was a rather indifferent astronomer. He completely misunderstood such elementary things as the cause of the moon's phases and the cause of eclipses. It is interesting to observe that this great achievement in cosmology was made not by an astronomer but by a metaphysician.</page><page sequence="16">152 George Bos wort h Burch later astronomers, following Hipparchus, felt obliged to reject itf not only because of its repugnance to common sense but also because of such scientific considerations as the apparent lack of parallax of the fixed stars. The fourth cosmology was not popularly accepted until Copernicus, and not satisfactorily justified until even later, when more precise techniques of mea surement revealed the true parallax of the nearer stars. Anaximander, then, deserves the credit for taking the first step in the history of scientific cosmology. But he took the first step only. He still thought of the earth as flat, with a hori zontal surface. Consequently he taught that the earth is cylin drical in shape, "like a stone column." We live on one of its flat surfaces. The opposite surface is underneath; presumably he supposed that anyone on that surface would fall off, although the sources do not discuss this question. He even had a theory of the proportions of the earth, stating that its altitude, or dis tance between the two flat surfaces, is one third of its diameter. Presumably he had some opinion concerning its size (espe cially if it is true that he made a map of the earth), but this has not been preserved.37 The theory that the earth is an unsupported heavenly body completely surrounded by empty space raises the problem of why it stays where it is. Anaximander solved this problem by saying that the earth, although supported by nothing (viro fir)8evb? KpaTOii4vnv)i stays still because of its equal distance from all things {fi?vovaav Se Si? tt/v 6?io?av irdvrcuv aTr?aTacriv). There is a certain vagueness about this; indeed, the problem of explaining the position of an unsupported earth in a space 87 His opinion, if any, concerning its size could only have been a guess, since a correct calculation of the size of the earth presupposes a correct understanding of its spherical shape. Its size was first calculated accurately by Eratosthenes, over three centuries later. The map of Heka taeus, whose knowledge extended from the Pillars of Hercules to the Indus, presumably represented the earth with a diameter of approximately 4,500 miles, but the admittedly inferior map of Anaximander, made not by a geographer but a metaphysician, may have represented it much larger or much smaller. Herodotus (IV 36) ridicules map makers who make "the earth itself to be an exact circle as if described by a pair of compasses."</page><page sequence="17">Anaximander, the First Metaphysician 153 of absolute up and down is a difficult one. Aristotle interprets Anaximander's theory as meaning that the earth moves neither up nor down nor sideways because, being at the center, it is constrained by indifference (o^oiornroc), having no tendency to move one way rather than another ? like a hair which, stretched strongly but evenly at every point, cannot break, or a man who, equally hungry and thirsty, and equally distant from food and drink, cannot move.38 However unsatisfactory Anaximander's solution may be, he squarely raised, and so far as we know he first raised, the problem of explaining the earth's position in space in cosmical or astronomical terms rather than by an uncritical analogy with things on the earth. (7)39 Anaximander first gave a true perspective on the physical universe and the earth's place in it by his statement that the sun is equal to the earth in size. To the modern reader this may seem an understatement, the error being in fact over 99%, but when we consider that over a century later Anaxa goras was prosecuted for saying the sun was as big as the Peloponnesus, we realize that Anaximander's estimate of its size was a creditable first approximation to the truth. It is the realization that the earth is not the biggest thing in the universe, rather than an accurate determination of the sun's size, which is important. Anaximander's rejection of the primitive cosmology made it impossible for him to think of the sun as a disk attached to the surface of the sky. But his failure to advance to the third cosmology prevented his regarding the sun as a body occupying its own natural place at a certain distance from the universal center of gravity. Since he said the earth held its place because of its equal distance from all things, he would presumably have expected an unsupported body at the sun's place, not being equidistant from all things, to fall away from that place. Conse 38 De C?elo 295b. Aristotle criticizes Anaximander's theory in favor of his own theory that the earth stays at the center because that is its natural place. But Aristotle was thinking in terms of a spherical earth, and so did not have Anaximander's problem. 89 Sources: Diels 12 A 11, 18, 22, B 4.</page><page sequence="18">154 George Bosworth Burch quently he could not consistently think of the sun as a body at all. He solved this problem by an ingenious theory of the sun's nature which, however fantastic it may seem to us, was con sistent with his cosmological system. In doing so he showed a truly scientific attitude in following a scientific hypothesis rather than the obvious appearances. According to Anaximander's theory the real sun is a hollow hoop filled with fire and having an opaque covering which makes it invisible.40 The apparent sun is a circular hole in this covering through which the fire is seen. Accidental closing of this hole causes eclipses. Rotation of the real sun about its center at the earth causes the revolution of the apparent sun about the earth. Presumably it is the apparent sun, that is the hole, which is referred to when the sun is said to be equal in size to the earth. He said that the size of this hoop is 27 times the size of the earth. If we interpret this as meaning that the hoop's diame ter is 27 times the earth's diameter, it follows that the apparent sun's distance is 27 times the earth's radius. While this again is a gross underestimate from the point of view of modern astronomy, it is a great advance over the primitive view which, confining the sun within the celestial dome, would make its greatest possible distance from the earth's center equal to the earth's radius. Anaximander took the first step which led ulti mately to the modern theory of the great distance of the hea venly bodies. If our sources are correct in attributing to Anaximander both the statement that the sun's diameter is equal to the earth's diameter and the statement that its distance is 27 times the earth's radius, he would seem to have committed a boner. While it is difficult to calculate the sun's size or distance, and we can only admire Anaximander for estimating them as well as he did, it is easy to calculate the ratio of the sun's distance to its diameter. The sun's angular diameter is about half a degree, and consequently its distance is1 approximately 100 40 There is no reason to suppose that Anaximander observed the zodiacal light, but it would strongly support his hypothesis.</page><page sequence="19">Anaximander, the First Metaphysician 155 times its linear diameter. If it were only 13J^ times, the angular diameter would be about four degrees and the sun would appear eight times as big at it actually does.41 There seems to be no way of explaining this discrepancy between fact and theory, and probably Anaximander never gave it a thought. The moon is explained by a similar hoop only 19 times as big at the earth. Its phases and eclipses are due to the clos ing of the aperture through which the inner fire is seen. Other hoops, smaller and so nearer than that of the moon, explain the stars and planets.42 All the heavenly bodies are described as hollow hoops "like a chariot wheel" filled with fire and "breath ing out flames" through orifices "like the air from a flute." We see in this hypothesis the earliest known formulation of what later developed into the theory of celestial spheres. The theory that the stars are nearer than the sun and moon strikes the modern reader as preposterous, opposed as it is not only to modern astronomy but even to the later ancient astro nomy. But this theory, while of course false, is nowise absurd or fantastic. The determination of the relative distances of the heavenly bodies is a very difficult task; until quite recently astronomers believed comets to be meteorological phenomena within the earth's atmosphere. The Babylonians thought of the 41 A variant source has the sun's hoop 28 (instead of 27) times the size of the earth, and this has been explained by the suggestion that 27 refers to the inner and 28 to the outer surface. If the hoop is a true anchor ring, its thickness must equal its width (the diameter of the apparent sun, equal to the diameter of the earth), and so, if the above suggestion is correct, the hoop's radius is 27 times the earth's diameter (not radius), the sun's distance twice as great, and Anaximander's error only half as great. But if the hoop's inner and outer diameter (not radius) are 27 and 28 times the earth's diameter, then the hoop is flattened, only half as thick as wide. This would be consistent with a reference which describes the celestial hoops as being "like chariot wheels." Zeller, following a reference which, if not emended, makes the sun's hoop 27 times as big as the moons, suggests that Anaximander may have made the size of the sun's orbit 513 times that of its disk; in which case its distance would be 256^ times its diameter, and it would appear approximately half (instead of eight times) as big as it actually does. 42 It is not clear whether there is a hoop for each star, or whether one hoop can have several holes.</page><page sequence="20">156 George Bosworth Burch sun as beyond the stars during its nocturnal motion, and neither reason nor appearance suggests that the stars must be more distant than the sun or moon. To Anaximander they seemed relatively near, while the mighty sun seemed to be the most distant, as well as the biggest, of all heavenly bodies.43 ( 8 )44 Anaximander founded physiological psychology 45 by his theory that the soul is airy 46 (?ep Srj rrj? tyvxys rVv 43 The theory that the sun, 27 earth radii distant, is the most distant object in the universe, although consistent with all facts known to Anaxi mander, is quite incompatible with Burnet's theory that the awapov means infinite space. "Anaximander had shaken himself free of the old idea that the heavens are a solid vault. There is nothing to prevent us from seeing right out into the Boundless, and it is hard to think that Anaxi mander did not believe he did. The traditional cosmos has given place to a much grander scheme, that of innumerable vortices in a boundless mass, which is neither water nor air. In that case, it is difficult to resist the belief that what we call the fixed stars were identified with the 'innumerable worlds' which were also 'gods'." (Early Greek Philosophy, 3rd ed., p. 69.) The statement that the stars are nearer than even the moon presents a serious difficulty for Burnet's view. He solves this by the hypothesis that the word "stars" refers not to the fixed stars but to the morning and evening stars. "What, then, are the 'stars' which are accounted for by this inner wheel ? ? venture to suggest that they are the morning and the evening stars, which, we have seen, were not recognized yet as a single luminary." (Ibid., p.69.) This gratuitous suggestion has no ground what ever except Burnet's necessity of following his own explanation of the airtipov. The relevant reference, in Burnet's own translation, reads as follows: "The sun is the highest of all, and lowest are the whells of the stars." (Ibid., p. 67.)

For the O.T. use, see Hastings' Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics, article "Spirit."</page><page sequence="21">Anaximander, the First Metaphysician 157 {fav&amp;Lv). No details are added, and this single statement is all we know of Anaximander's psychology. While it may seem forced to attribute this doctrine to him on the evidence of a single word in a single sentence,47 the prevalence of the doctrine among the later Ionian scientists makes it very plausible that he should have taught it, and the question seems to be not so much whether he did teach this theory as whether he was the first to teach it. But the credit must be given to the first teacher known to us, and, however many predecessors he may actually have had, Anaximander is the first person to whom our extant sources attribute the pneumatic theory of the soul.48 This theory was destined to be one of the most fruitful hypotheses in the whole history of science. It superseded the primitive theory, well known from Homer and the Old Testa ment, that the essence of the soul is the blood. Anaximenes 49 47 And this not too well vouched for, his name being found ( in inexplicably unchronological order) in a list of pneumatic psychologists excerpted from Aetius by Theodoret, but omitted in a corresponding excerpt by Stobaeus. This led B?umker to reject it (Jahrb?cher f?r Classische Philologie herausg. von A. Fleckeisen, 1885, p. 828, n. 7). For the sources see Diels, Doxographi Graeci, 2nd ed., p. 387. 48 According to Aetius (Dox. Gr., ibid.), Thaies first taught imma terialistic, and Anaximander materialistic, psychology. 49 Anaximenes of Miletus, like Anaximander, wrote a book which is extant in one sentence only but the doctrine of which can be partially reconstructed from ancient references (collected in Diels, Fragmente der Vorsokratiker, 5th ed., vol. 1, sec. 13). In view of the uncertainty of his dates we do not know whether he could have been personally acquainted with Anaximander; but since he was at any rate younger than Anaximander (as all authorities agree), it is reasonable to suppose that he was acquainted with his famous fellow citizen's book and would have been influenced by him through it. This influence is most apparent in his psychology. He repeated Anaxi mander's statement that the soul is airy, introduced the word Trvevfia to describe it, and apparently was influential in establishing the pneumatic psychology. But Anaximenes gave it a cosmic application, saying (the ?xtant sentence, Dieh 13 B 2), "As our soul, which is air (?rjp) holds us together (ovvKpaTti r/fias), so do breath (wvfvfia) and air (ar?p) en compass 7repL ^ei a word applied by Anaximander to the airupov) the whole word (o\ov t6v koct/aov)." His cosmology is also like Anaximan</page><page sequence="22">158 George Bos worth Burch developed this theory, brought it into harmony with his gen eral scientific system, and introduced into psychology, as a synonym for depa&amp;r), the technical term wvevfia (literally breath), equivalent to Latin spiritus and English ghost. Hera clitus distinguished qualities in the soul thus conceived as a gas: the dry or fiery and therefore more rational, and the wet or watery and therefore less rational. The physiologist Diogenes of Apollonia called mind (vorjavs) an attribute of air, and ex plained the mental differences between individuals and between species in terms of the quality of the air which constitutes their der's in that he describes the earth as flat "like a table" and resting only on air, which is compressed by the weight of the earth and so keeps it from falling. But he considers the sun, moon, and planets to be flat "like leaves" and therefore held up by the air, while the stars are said to be fixed "like nails" in the crystalline heaven. It is in physics, however, that Anaximenes is preeminent. He explains all physical transformations of one kind of matter into another by the mechanical process of condensation and rarefaction of the same continuing matter. This underlying matter appears in its natural state as the air which surrounds us ? infinite in extent (t?&gt; /lev pey?(ki aweipov) but definite in qualities (rat? Se wept avrbv iroiorrpriv ?yptxrfx?vov). It differs in rarity and density (fJLavorrfTi Kal ttvkv?ttjtl) "according to the essences" (/car? r?? ovalas) of the things it becomes. Air expanded becomes fire. Air condensed becomes wind; still more condensed, cloud; then water; then earth; finally stone. From these, and so ultimately from air, all things, even the gods and divine entities ( xal Odovs Kal Beta), are made ? whence air is called the source of things (?PXVV vovtwv). "Out of it all things arise (yiyvecrOai) and into it they are resolved again ( iraKtv ?vakvctrdai)." All natural phenomena -? winds, clouds, rain, hail, snow, lightning, rainbows, earth quakes ? are explained in terms of this mechanical process. The motion (/anyo-ic) responsible for these transformations is eternal (alSiov) and has always existed (r-qv ye firjv Kivrjmv cf alwvos virapx&amp;v). Thus we see that Anaximenes taught the explanation of physical phenomena in terms of quantitative changes of the primary qualities ? like the ancient atomists and modern scientists. Anaximander, so far as we can judge from obscure sources, taught the explanation of physical phenomena in terms of qualitative changes ? like Aristotle and medieval alchemists. In this field Anaximenes is far superior to his predecessor. In the field of metaphysics, so far as our sources inform us, Anaximenes taught nothing (and so, perhaps, was the first positivist; the three Milesians are a good example of Comte's three stages of knowledge). If Anaximander was the founder of metaphysics, Anaximenes holds an equally distinguished position as the founder of scientific physics.</page><page sequence="23">Anaximander, the First Metaphysician 159 souls. The atomists and Epicureans identified soul with the purest gas composed of the smallest, roundest, and smoothest atoms. The physician Galen distinguished four kinds of liquid (the four "humors")and three kinds of gas in the body; the latter are the natural spirit {rrvevfia (favcruc?v) circulating in the veins, the vital spirit (irvev/xa ^odtlkov) in the arteries, and the psychic spirit (irvevfia i/tu^ikoV, Latin Spiritus ani~ malis) in the nerves. His physiological theory, in which mental phenomena are explained by the "animal spirits" {irveofia \\tv \ik6v) in the nervous system, dominated scientific psychology for many centuries. The pneumatic hypothesis also explained the phenomena of abnormal phychology in terms of demonic or divine inspiration (literally understood). It was even ex tended to Christian theology 50 by the anthropomorphic doc trine (expressed in terms of the scientific psychology of the apostolic period) of the Holy ?vev/ia (English Ghost).51 While this theory continued to dominate scientific thought, the opposed Platonic theory of an immaterial soul, championed by Augustine, came gradually to dominate religious thought. Descartes harmonized the two theories by his doctrine of two substances, explaining all psychic phenomena in the human or animal body in terms of the animal spirits, and consciousness (attributed to humans only) in terms of the immaterial "think ing thing." This compromise was followed by Locke. With the invention of the microscope, which revealed that the nerves are not hollow tubes but solid wires, the pneu matic theory collapsed. Hartley interpreted nervous activity in terms of vibrations of the nerves, while more recent neuro logists have described it in terms of electric currents 52 in the nerves.53 But, even though now obsolete, the long held Anaxi 50 Also the theology of the mysteries (R. Reitzenstein, Die Helle nistische Mysterienreligionen, 3rd ed., pp. 308ff). 51 But liturgy, always more conservative than theology, continued (and still continues) to be dominated by the primitive blood theory of the soul. 52 Cf. Boring, Langfeld, and Weld, Introduction to Psychology, p. 231: "The active region of the neuron fiber is electrically negative in relation to the unexcited portion of the same fiber." The free electrons (small, unat</page><page sequence="24">160 George Bosworth Burch mandrian-Galenic theory that the soul is spirit has left an inde lible mark on our language. Keeping the words of the pneu matic theory even when we have abandoned the theory itself, we still call the soul a spirit, reinterpret the word spirit to mean an immaterial being, and make spiritual a synonym for imma terial. These eight contributions to philosophy and science form an impressive total. We might add, as a ninth contribution, the concept of a system of philosophy, since Anaximander's book is the first in the long series of systematic treatises in the history of western philosophy. While his metaphysical doctrine seems to have had little immediate influence in the presocratic period, all his metaphysical ideas came eventually to occupy prominent positions in later philosophical thought. Both for his historical importance as the founder of Greek metaphysics and for the intrinsic value of his doctrine itself, Anaximander holds an honorable place among those intellectual and spiritual teachers in many parts of the world who made the sixth century B.C. the golden age of philosophy, George Bosworth Burch Tufts College tached, and swift), the motion of which constitutes an electric current, seem very similar in definable properties to Lucretius's small, unattached, swift "soul atoms." 53 Recent observations with the electron microscope have shown that nerve fibers really are hollow tubes (approximately six millionths of a centimeter in diameter) after all. (DeRobertis and Schmitt, "An Electron Microscope Analysis of Certain Nerve Axon Constituents," Journal of Cellular and Comparative Physiology, vol. 31, No. 1, Feb. 1948, p. 3; "The available evidence is consistent with the view that they are tubular, possessing a thin wall of relatively high electron density and a core of low destiny."
