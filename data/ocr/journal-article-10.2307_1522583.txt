As the investigation expanded to cover a wider range in both space and time, it became obvious that the modest size originally planned for the subject would be insufficient. A sequence of topics is all that remains now of the original working plan. References to some related art objects have been brought to the writer's attention by colleagues and students whose suggestions are herewith gratefully acknowledged. Museums and private collections have generously contributed many photographs. The writer is especially grateful to Professor S. Umehara for his kindness in lending two illustrations. Mr. John F. Haskins provided numerous line drawings. Miss Florance Waterbury and Mr. Haskins undertook the difficult task of revising and editing the text. The writer assures all these kind helpers of his profound gratitude.

They are of ar- resting interest; not only by reason of their provenance, which is an insufficiently explored site, but also they illustrate the style of one of the most portentous eras in the history of Far Eastern art, and fit into a far reaching cycle of iconography. We begin with a description of the antlers and their relationship in time and space, sup- Fig. i Pair of carved and painted stag antlers. China, IV-III century B.C.

An attempt will be made to establish the significance of antler symbols in general, and to trace their development in Europe and Asia. Finally, we shall endeavor to explain the most prominent of all attributes associated with the antlers - namely the extended tongue. The comparative material which will be presented here should be completed by a dis- cussion of monuments from Nepal and Tibet. Problems of heraldry, illustrated on several coats of arms, have been disregarded as immaterial. Archaeological material from the West- ern Hemisphere, the ethnography of North America, as well as the objects from the Pacific Island cultures have been left for an investigation by competent specialists in these fields. I. DESCRIPTION The size and shape of the New York antlers identify them as those of pseudaxis hortulo- rum Swvinhoe, a variety of the spotted deer. Skeletal remains of this species have been found at the well known site of An-yang, the most important capital of the late Shang state and period, dated according to the so-called "orthodox " chronology as circa 1400- 124 B. C. The excavators considered the remains as "probably identical with the sika of Peking",1 a statement which holds as well for the horns under discussion here. The state of preservation of the antlers leaves much to be desired. They emerged from the ground in a badly worn and eroded condition, and have been broken and repair- ed repeatedly since then. The presence of only two tines on each branch, however, should not be attributed to intentional or accidental elimination of additional ones, but to the re- lative immaturity of the animal from which the antlers were taken. This is proven by the fact that another pair of branches also came from a six point buck (fig. 5). The antlers underwent alterations before being put to some use, which will be de- termined presently. One of these changes, the fashioning of the burrs into truncated four- sided pyramids, indicates that they were to be inserted into a base. Furthermore, the tips of prongs and tines were sawed off so that all extensions terminate in a flat circular cross section. A shallow concavity was ground in the center of each circular section. On the brow tines this concavity is of a smaller diameter than on the upper points. These con- cavities obviously contained an additional substance, the nature and significance of which will be discussed in a later paragraph. Finally, the surface of the horns was scraped off to permit carving and painting of ornaments. The latter have survived in part only. Enough remains to indicate that all decorative elements were arranged within encircling bands, separated by grooves or lines. Carved ornaments appear as flat silhouettes over sunken ground, 1 P.

Although technique and sequence of pattern differ from one prong to another, they belong together because they share some motifs as well as their arrangement. One beam is accidentally longer than the other; it is also better preserved. The decoration consists mainly of carvings. Two narrow bands, filled by the profiles of animals with circular eyes, are barely visible between the burr and brow tine. Narrow and broad sections follow, above the lowest shoulder. The former has repetitions of the animal silhouettes, the latter an all over pattern of angular spirals (fig. 2). Animal and spiral bands alternate above the bez tine, leading to a belt of long narrow triangles with descending apexes at the end of the prong. Only three bands are still recognizable on the brow tine. They consist of a carved band of angular spirals, a painted band of animal silhouettes, and a carved band of hanging triangles at the extremity. The ornaments of the bez tine are entirely obliterated. In contrast to the predominant carving of the long beam, painted decoration prevails on the shorter one. This begins above the burr with "S" shaped double spirals. The next readable group of ornaments lies between the tines where horizontal garlands are framed above and below by single spirals which are irregularly placed (fig. 3). Above this section may be seen two bands of painted animal silhouettes, two consisting of carved angular spirals, and a carved band of acute hanging triangles. In this instance, the latter motif is removed from the tip, the decoration of which is unrecognizable. With the exception of a few painted spirals and garlands, the adornment of the tines has vanished. II. DATE AND PROVENANCE The antlers were twice published as An-yang finds of the Shang period,2 before they entered the collection of the American Museum of Natural History. Since then, some per- tinent discoveries have been made in China and earlier ones have become accessible. In view of this material, a reconsideration of the position of these objects in time and space becomes necessary. Some clues for dating may be deduced from the ornaments. The carved angular spirals, adequately named "Interlocked T's", loom largest among them. This decor is well known from the bronzes of Shang and Early Western Chou, that is from circa 1400 to 950 B.C. It is significant, however, that it was revived during Late Eastern Chou, between 600 and 2 S.

C. 4 Reference to a mirror in the Hosokawa collection in Tokyo, an object assigned to the III century B. C.,5 is of particular interest because its two levels are enhanced by a painted blue background and T's painted in bright red. The T's and other ornaments on the antlers may have been provided with a similar color effect. When one turns to the carved or painted animal profiles, attention is drawn to the plain surfaces and lobed contours. They bear close resemblance to a flat jade plaque in the Chicago Museum of Natural History (fig. 4). At the time of original publication, this animal re- ceived only the general designation of "Chou".6 ?^[ .This wide margin of time may be narrowed by reference to a bracket-like flange above the head. This feature originated during Middle Chou, circa 950 to 600 B. C., 7 and lingered through the following period.8 The animal silhouettes thus Fig. 4 prove that an origin for the antlers prior to Animal silhouette. Jade 950 B. C. is impossible. The choice between China, VII-IV century B. C. Middle and Late Eastern Chou, offered by the Coll. Chicago Museum of Natural History figure motif is reduced to the latter period by reason of the presence of the interlocked T's. Bands of acute triangles which resemble saw teeth have been considered as a motif which occured later than 200 B. C.. This was accepted until their existence during the VI century B. C. was noticed.9 Consequently, the presence of these triangle bands does not invalidate a date that is suggested by the coexistence of interlocked T's and lobed animal silhouettes. This is also true of the single and "S" shaped double spirals. These spirals are known from painted bone or horn cheek 'pieces of the period, objects which were not recognized as terminals of horse bits when first published.10 The assumption that the antlers in the Museum of Natural History were a Shang find from An-yang is disproved, not only by a comparative analysis of the ornament, but by the B.

Ground was levelled for building purposes at Ch'ang-sha in Hunan province in 1936. This led to the exposure of several graves which had remained undisturbed until that time. The circumstances surrounding the unearthing of their contents were verified on the spot by two competent observers, J. H. Cox, 1 and S. Elisseff. 12 One burial yielded the mon- umental wood figure now in the J. H. Cox collection (fig. 9). The accidental discovery of an undisturbed grave, containing this and other art objects made of a medium which in China has not survived from such a remote age, must have been followed by the depredations of grave robbers, who descended on Ch'ang-sha or neighboring sites. The number of horned wood figures has reached five by now, not to mention several more or less fragmentary pieces. Like the antlers in New York, they all belong in style to Late Eastern Chou. Descriptions of these objects will demonstrate that they constitute a homogeneous group. A majority of these Ch'ang-sha sculptures, listed as such, are discussed in a recent Chinese publication, one of a series devoted exclusively to finds from this Hunan site.13 III. RELATED WOOD SCULPTURES A. HUMAN BUSTS One wood sculpture supposedly of Ch'ang-sha origin is still in China. It is known only through a line drawing (fig. 5). 4 If one compares the schematic reproduction of another monument (fig. i i) with an actual photograph of the same object (fig. 9), it is readily apparent that the in- formation visible in the line cut is insufficient and possibly unreliable. The sculpture reproduced in line, however, heads our list of comparisons because it carries stag antlers with the same number of tines as the pair in New York. The surfaces of the antlers on the example still in China 11 J. H. Cox, An Exhibition of Chinese Antiquities from Ch'ang sha, New Haven 1939 passim. 12 S.

An oval face rests on a flaring neck which merges into a simplified body, assuming the shape of a long parallelopiped. The latter stands on a short square block, supported in turn by a broad base. The most striking feature of this figure is the long tongue with a median ridge and pointed tip which almost reaches the stand. A similar wood sculpture is now in the British Museum, London (figs. 6-7). This piece had been published several times before it entered the museum's collections.'5 The head is full round and displays strongly accentuated features: a broad mouth with up-turned corners, a nose with sharply curved ridge, and empty, concave eye sockets. Antlers in their original state are inserted into the domed skull. One of the branches retains the original four tines. The neck curves backward and is slightly tapered. Both the neck and the elon- gated chest have been adapted to cubic forms which are square in cross section. An enor- mous flat tongue hangs down over the stand, which is a short truncated pyramid, rising from a broad base with sloping upper edges. Bust, stand and base all retain traces of multilobed spirals painted in red and green on a white gesso ground. Here, as well as in all following references to colors, no distinction is made between paint and colored lacquer. Although both seem to be present in some instances, differences cannot be established without technical analysis. It is elucidating to make a comparison between the pieces just described and a figure from Ch'ang-sha (fig. 8). This sculpture shows a physical type which is completely human and represented in the round. Except for a mouth widened on the horned busts to ac- commodate the tongue, all facial details are identical in each instance. This statement could be repeated for nearly all of the wooden statues of warriors and attendants from Hunan sites. 16 In common with all of these figures, the head of the Ch'ang-sha bust portrays an ancient inhabitant of the locality. B. ANIMAL PROTOMES At Ch'ang-sha, animal as well as human figures wear horns, the former being all of a fero- cious feline character.

Several views of this object have appeared in previous publications.17 The sculpture consists of the foreparts of two addorsed animals. Both heads have stag antlers, now in poor condition. A drawing which has been published frequently and is re- liable only for the head ornaments, shows three tines on each horn (fig. ii). They have been described as made of deer horn with the core removed. 18 According to a recent sug- gestion, the material is bark. 19 Each head represents the Late Eastern Chou version of the ubiquitous Chinese beast of fantasy, the so-called t'ao-t'ieh; a meaningless term, which was ably replaced in an American publication by the identification of the beast as a tiger with changing attributes. 20 Prominent characteristics are the spool-shaped upper lip, the absence of a lower jaw, and the sharp, out-curved fangs at the corners of the mouth (fig. 9). Large circular eyes are painted on truncated cones of a telescope shape. A wedge shaped nose leads to a forehead covered by two large modeled spirals and flanked on a lower level by another pair of similar ornaments. A hanging tongue, preserved on one animal only, does not touch the body. The trunks and limbs of the animals, consistently square or rectangular in cross sec- tion, may be observed in a profile view (fig. o). The projecting heads are joined by horizontal necks which are divided at the upper edge by a median incision. Below, a single parallelopiped stands for the vertical continuation of both necks until it parts again and leads obliquely to the thickened shoulders. These are joined by horizontal chests which are bisected in the same manner as the necks. The forelegs rise upward and back, and terminate in two-pronged claws. The latter frame and overlap ram's horns which descend from the back of the heads. The double protome rests on a square block, supported by a short truncated pyramid with a rectangular base, which in turn stands on a smaller formation. The base is a block with a slightly raised rim en- circled by a median groove. On each side, two vertical incisions extend half way down, encompassing an apron-like middle section. The latter, being on a higher level, overlaps the horizontal groove. 17 S. Mizuno, The Tohk Gakuho, no. 8, op. cit., fig. 7. T S. Umehara, Ho-un, no. 21, op. cit., pls. I-III and fig. i. J. H.

Spirals and oblique bands dominate on the base and stand. They resemble the inlay patterns on Late Eastern Chou bronzes. 2 Turning to the profile views (fig. o), one finds a pair of crossed line combinations which, together with the undulating bands, suggest debased animal designs. The shoulders are marked by blunt angles which terminate in spirals with smaller additional spirals. Axe shapes lead to arms covered by notched scales of dif- ferent colors that alternate asymmetrically. On the inverted Y formed by the parting and joining of the necks, the decoration consists of angular spirals, followed by a heart shape descending from a small central circle and enclosed by a larger heart, which is placed in the opposite direction. This is followed by an eyeless animal face with hanging side lappets. The horizontal necks are decorated with curvilinear compositions which terminate at the lower edges in profiles of dissolved animal heads. A frontal view of the complete protome reveals concentric pear-shaped decoration on the arms, and twelve horizontal rows of small circles on the tongue (fig. 9). A return to the central heart and flanking spiral-with-triangle motif may be seen on the heads when viewed from above. 22 The ornamentation of the antlers deserves special attention (fig. I I). This consists of four encircling bands, partly in- cised and partly painted in red, and thus presenting an effective contrast with the black lacquer of the plain surface. Three of these bands are at the base of the tines. The fourth one is slightly above the middle, between the two lowest protrusions. It consists of three bands; two, of concentric circles, embrace a median band of lozenges filled by short strokes. A simple circle is centrally placed in each lozenge. This circle is repeated in the triangular interstices (fig. I2 a). The other belts of ornament are limited to spirals filled with short slanting strokes on a more robustly striated ground (fig. 12b). This may seem meager adornment when compared to the all-over decoration of the New York antlers. However, the grouping in bands, together with the presence of spirals, is sufficient evidence to establish a stylistic relation- a b ship between the hollow, and possibly artificial, Fig. I2a-b. Details of Fig. 9 horns and the natural massive ones. In a final analysis, the human busts in China (fig.S) and the British Museum (figs. 6-7), together with the animal foreparts in the Cox collection (figs. 9-12) indicate that the New York antlers (figs. 1-3) functioned originally as a head ornament for a human or animal 21 J G.

Painted wood sculpture. China, IV-III century B. C. Collection . H. Cox, Washington figure. Since the number of tines on these examples varies from two to three for each branch, it may be assumed that this feature had no influence on the eligibility of the anters for symbolic use. To complete the survey of related wood sculptures from Ch'ang-sha, a double animal protome in the Chicago Art Institute should be mentioned first (fig. I 3). Although the antlers, tongues, and base are missing, the Chicago sculpture is very similar to the one in the Cox collection. The main difference between the two monuments lies in the painted decoration, though the colors are the same in both instances. The Chicago fragment displays dragonesque silhouettes on the chests, and agitated curves on the arms of the inverted Y. Two animal profiles in vertical sequence appear on its stem, and a parted stalk with two dragon-like profiles near the upper edges of the necks. The ornamentation on the side and front of the arms is a simplified version of that observed on the corresponding parts of the sculpture in the Cox collection. In addition to the double tiger foreparts in the two examples just described, Ch'ang-sha knew the single beast with horns as well, as is shown by an example in the J. H. Cox col- lection (fig. 14). Although the antlers are missing, the holes for their insertion are clearly 11</page><page sequence="21">visible. 23 Since the corners are rounded in this instance, the cubic character of the limbs, prominent on all sculptures discussed so far, is less pronounced here. The stand differs from the others in that it is an inverted truncated pyramid, composed of four gradually diminish- ing tiers. This shape is met by the broad base with slanting upper edges. The painted de- coration of the figure stands out as an addition to the repertory. The colors used are brown, red, and a rather clean white. The band of herring-bone hanging leaves along the upper edge of the base deserves special attention. It is the first vegetative pattern so far encounter- ed among the Ch'ang-sha wood sculptures. Disconnected angular spirals, well known from the lacquered beams of the period, 24 follow on the slant of the base. Horizontal zig-zags cover the tiers of the stand. There are large spirals on the elbow joints of the animal. Triangle and spiral combinations may be seen on the horizontal sides of the body, and shallow and irregularly drawn scales along the neck. The legs and head are covered with dots. Another wooden animal is known only through a rather inadequate repro- ' duction,25 but it may be added to the l (1 group because it is mentioned as being horned in its original state (fig. I5). It may well be a squatting beast, connected to its massive base by a receding stand. This figure in common with all others is / square in cross section throughout, and f like the double beasts (figs. 9-1 ) has bulg- ing eyes. While poor reproduction makes exact description difficult, a deep groove seems to separate the upper lip and the teeth from the eyes and nose. The most distinctive feature of the sculpture is the _ f __ .. direction taken by the extended tongue, I i which is bent backward and then thrust 1i crisply forward at an angle. 23 Chiang Yuen yi, op. cit., p. i I, c-d. 24 Relics of Han and Pre-Han Dynasties, Ex- Fig. I5 hibition Catalogue, Tokyo I932, pl.

Marx of Chicago, augments the repertory of Ch'ang-sha wood sculptures (figs. i6-1 7). This statue furnishes motifs of great consequence as will be shown in subsequent paragraphs. The face, still resembling that of a tiger, lacks a lower jaw but has sharp fangs at the corners of the upper one. More than any of the other wooden animals, the features of this one are sub- jected to strict cubism which adapts the body parts to square and rectangular cross sections. The curve of the neck and the long tongue are in line with other foreparts. However, the free standing ram's horns seem rather small for the holes from which they emerge, and short in relation to the figure. The wood of the horns is certainly of considerable age, and its thinness may have been the result of shrinkage and an ensuing discrepancy of proportions. Any modern endeavor to complete the statue, however, would have attempted to achieve a more balanced effect. The best argument in favor of the authenticity of these ram's horns comes from a comparison with other animal crowns, inasmuch as the holes for stag antlers are much further removed from the foreheads and are always placed on a horizontally flattened skull. It is true that no other wooden monument from Ch'ang-sha has free standing ram's horns, but at least a relie rerndering of these animal parts could be observed on the addorsed pairs of the Cox collection (fig. 9-i i) and of the Chicago Art Institute (fig. I 3). The base of the Marx protome has more monumental proportions than those of re- lated pieces. The stand enhances the contrast between the animal and its support. A pa- rallelopiped, narrower than the bust, rests on a square block of the same width as the sculpture. The block rests in turn on a broad and massive base with slanting edges, and the sides of the base are vertically bisected by deeply carved bands. Horizontal grooves, con- siderably below the middle, lead to central salients which reach upward, thus inverting the order observed on the base of the double animal in the Cox collection (figs. 9-II). The painted decoration resembles that of the human bust in the British Museum (figs. 6-7) in that it is composed of red spirals, although here they extend horizontally. Vertical zig-zags of the same color on the narrowest part of the stand are reminiscent of the horizontal ones on the single animal of the Cox collection (fig. 14). The tongue retains a coat of bright red which is so thick that it was, in all probability, never decorated. The most conspicuous painting covers the sides and the back of the protome (fig. 17). In this instance, spirals composed of three lines of bluish-white, red, and dark gray in that order, merge into slender red branches which extend to the neck. These branches are trimmed with gold and silver leaves and are by far the most impressive plant ornamentation of Ch'ang- sha art so far discovered. The structure of stems and foliage can be observed on a bronze vessel formerly in the Louvre and now in the Guimet Museum, Paris.26 26 N.Vandier, t Note sur un vase chinois du Musee du Louvre a, Rev. des Arts Asiat.

STAG ANTLERS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE FAR EAST IN LATE EASTERN CHOU TIMES Anthropomorphic beings composed of different animal parts including stag antlers are mentioned in the Shan Hai Ching, a text which in part goes back to Han times. 27 Certain spirits are described there as having "animal bodies, human faces and antlers".28 Others sport ram's horns.29 Wood sculptures discovered at or attributed to Chcang-sha carry precisely these head ornaments. They make it possible also to establish the horns in the American Museum of Natural History (fig. i) as the headgear of a figure stele. A few con- temporary objects in different media, some of different provenance, and all rendered two- dimensionally, illustrate stag horns as they were actually worn by men, and imagined to be worn by animals. They elucidate the function of horn crowned figures during the period and facilitate understanding of their significance as symbols. A fragmentary bronze vessel of unique importance may be seen at the Seattle Museum of Art (fig. 1 8). It is supposed to have come from the same Hunan site as the wood sculp- tures. Being a bowl'of the type Ih, it served as a sacrificial pouring vessel for some liquid. The spout, a wide section behind it, and most of the rim are all that survive. The interior of the remaining portions is richly engraved. Three large fish fill the spout, the middle one facing outward, the two flanking ones facing in the opposite direction. The scene directly behind the spout must have been one of particular importance among those illustrated on this bronze. This one alone is framed by borders which separate it from the scenes around the rim, and from the decoration on the spout (fig. 19). As a central theme, two dancers with stag antlers on their heads move rhythmically toward one another. Long sleeves fall over their hands, a detail of costume which is still typical 'of Chinese choreography at the present day. Two other persons advance with outstretched arms toward the pair of dancers, and are followed by two at- tendants in less agitated posture. These as well as the other human figures on the bowl are clad in garments decorated with oblique striations. The robes extend without interruption from chin to hidden feet. Long-necked birds, evidently of the crane or stork family, enliven a stage which is interspersed with trees depicted as stemmed bowls with vertical strokes as foliage. Files of arborescent ornament with spiky branches fill the side borders. 27 L. Lanciotti, "The Shan Hai Ching", East and West, IV, I, Rome 1953, p. 53. 28 K.

It is flanked by two flags. On the more damaged edge of the vessel, an archer aims at the target from which he is separated by two trees. On the better preserved side (fig. 20), a figure adjacent to the dancing scene stands on a scaffolding and carries a bow, evidently preparing to take part in the archery contest. Between him and the target are shown two figures. One appears to be a youth bent over and holding a tree as if to plant it. The second is a man holding a pole in his right hand and supporting it with his left. He might well be a score keeper. The dance scene takes place out of doors. This is clearly shown by the variegated vegetation which surrounds it. It should be noted in this relationship that agrarian fertility rites were performed in the open within the territory of the Tai, one of the important racial components of South China. 30 This was probably true for the country as a whole. The dance on the Seattle bronze, however, was not for the benefit of the fields. The in- troduction of water fowl into the scene indicates the proximity of a stream or lake. The stage for the dance, together with the fish on the spout, suggests that the liquid offered in this bowl, and the action depicted on the most conspicuous part of the interior, served a ritual designed to insure an abundance of the food supply from the water. For the ceremony to be successful, it was necessary for the chief performers to wear stag antlers. The combina- tion of dance, ceremonial arrow-shooting, and food gathering is known from several con- temporary bronzes.31 The planting of the tree might have been beneficiary in other re- spects. In West Africa, for instance, the setting of a tree into the earth is supposed to confine the demon of sterility to the ground. 32 Ch'ang-sha has yielded another pictorial document, an inscribed and painted silk square.38 Unfortunately, the text has not been translated as yet. Furthermore, the figure border has faded, and the color reproduction given by Ts'ai Li hsiang is not to be trusted. Among other weird beings, it shows an anthropomorphic figure with tineless antlers on its head (fig. 21). 30 W.

One of the composite beasts taking part in an enigmatic scene is a beaked griffin with two-pronged claws wearing a lyra shaped pair of horns with animal head terminals. 34 Stag horns as additions to animal silhouettes may be found in the so-called Dong so'n culture of Northern Annam. This region received many artistic influences from South China, mostly during Late Eastern Chou times. While some of the Dong so'n objects, to be discussed presently, may be dated from following centuries, they continue to carry re- miniscences of the period under consideration. For this reason, they may be considered along with other works contemporary to the Hunan wood sculptures. The Dong so'n motif pertinent to this study is a file of cervids, frequently found on bronze axes and drums (fig. 22). The males are clearly distinguished by the presence of sexual organs. The puzzling fact remains, .J however, that, contrary to nature, does as well are shown wearing antlers. It has already been recognized that these images "are not meant Fig. 22 to be portraits of living animals but are magic Detail of bronze drum. Dong so'n III-I century B.C. symbols."85 If it is permissable to assume that a myth reported from North China was also current in the South, one may turn to a report from a region north of the Yang-tze. It tells about an imaginary species, the Pi-hsieh, " which looks like a stag with two horns; it is an animal which repells (evil) spirits".36 Ob- viously, this serviceable ability was contingent upon the presence of antlers. Thus both sexes had to be provided with the magic contrivance. Therefore, the cervids represented on the Dong so'n bronzes are Pi-hsieh, and as such, particularly appropriate for the decora- tion of ritual or funerary objects. 84 Vandier, op. cit., fig. 6a. 85 B.

THE EVOLUTION OF THE ANTLER SYMBOL A. THE PALAEOLITHIC The search for the origin of stag horns as an element of figure composition leads one back to the oldest art of mankind. Two examples come from the final stage of the Palaeolithic, the Magdalenian. One wall painting, also partly carved, was discovered during the year 1914 in the "Cave of the Three Brothers" near Montesquieu-Avantes, Departe- ment of Ariege, in Southern France. 87 It represents a beard- ed man, possibly wearing a mask, with wolf ears, a horse tail, bear's claws, and large stag or reindeer horns (fig. 23). The position of his legs suggests a dance. Beard, tail and antlers are also worn by another male figure which is engraved on a slate plate from Lourdes.88 The apparel and movement have been explained as those of a sorcerer with magic powers gained through the addition of different animal attributes. TA Fig. 23 Wall carving and painting "Cave of the Three Brothers" Montesquieu-AvantEs, France Palaeolithic, Magdalenian period B. THE MESOLITHIC AND THE NEOLITHIC After having been considered no more than an ephemeral stage of transition, the Mesolithic period gains in importance through an increasing number of finds. A recent dis- covery which has been assigned to the Maglemose phase illustrates the continuity in the use of the antler symbol. The excavation of a small hunter's camp at Star Carr in Yorkshire, England, revealed several deer skulls with antlers among the belongings of its dwellers.89 The assumption that they were paraphernalia used in ritual dances is confirmed by the al- terations to which they had been subjected. The weight of the horns was reduced by hollowing them out. The interior of the skulls was adapted to a cap-like shape. They were scraped and perforated, thus making it possible to fasten them onto a human head. 87 H. Kuhn, Kunst und Kultur der Vorzeit Europas.

I86, no. 5, May 1952. 17</page><page sequence="31">Sets of antlers which were used for ceremonial purpose also came from graves on islands off the shore of Brittany. 0 The excavation report shifts from a mesolithic to neolithic at- tribution without giving a final decision as to the period. In some of these graves, male skeletons are found in a sitting position. They wore either an ornamental contraption of interlocked antlers above their heads or branches of stag horn arranged like a halo. Three horns in a similar combination were also noted in a female burial. The excavators stated that such head ornaments occur only in graves which were provided with a wealth of funerary gifts. They concluded that the dead who were distin- guished by antlers must have been heroes, chieftains, or religious dignitaries, thus honored by a headdress of ritual and symbolic significance. In some remote corners of the world, the stone age survived until it became con- temporary with more advanced civilizations in other countries. North Annam has such a retarded prehistory which can not be placed in any absolute chronology. This is clearly demonstrated in a cave at Hoa binh which contains stalactites engraved with human heads wearing antlers.41 They are primitive enough to be considered as lingerings from the prehistoric. C. THE ANCIENT NEAR EAST Symbolic images of cervids occur in the art of both Asia Minor and Persia, from the third millennium B.C. until Roman times. Wild sheep, horses, or the ass may be substituted for the stag. The emphasis on a given species depends upon its importance in the economy of an ethnic or political unit. The stag is associated with male gods in Anatolia. 42 As the steed of protective male deities, it plays a leading role in the Hittite pantheon. 43 The numerous examples which are represented in these regions showing figures crowned with horns nearly all illustrate bulls' horns. However, one example shows stag antlers. This may be seen on a seal from Syria which has been described as "a stag standing upright, having a human thorax and hands". The animal portions of this figure were noted as "unparalleled in Syrian art", pointing to Hittite influence. 44 40 Marthe &amp; Saint Just Pequart, ?

No antler symbol from Far Eastern prehistory has as yet emerged from the ground. At present, one is thrust upon the threshold of Chinese history of about 1400 B. C. (by orthodox chronology), more than 300 years after the beginning of the Shang era. One is suddenly confronted with the written records of oracle bones, tortoise shells and bronze inscriptions. Their highly developed pictographs are the result of a long evolution, still entirely unknown. The Shang script has several symbols for the word deer. One of them appears above a character for fire, and two are shown above a character for the sun. These, according to Hentze, connect the animal with dawn and the morning sun. 4 Mention will be made of this subject again. The pictographs of deer lend themselves to fantastic transformations. 46 One depicts a man shown frontally, wearing single-tined antlers. 47 Almost no other object of the period illustrates this, or any similar combination. There is, however, one exception; a bone carving of a snake with a complete stag's head. 48 The rarity of representation of cervid parts in Shang figure compositions has led to the conclusion that the deer "had no religious significance" at that time. 49 Beginning in Shang, and more frequently after 11 00oo B. C. - during Early Western Chou - one finds "spade-horns", worn by non-cervids. 50 This type of head ornament has no similarity to a tined antler, and may be disregarded. Another ruminant is always shown in this period with capped horns provided with only one incurved brow tine. This ac- coutrement does not appear on non-cervid heads, and need not be discussed in this relation- ship. So far, the Middle Chou period has yielded no representation of stags nor of their horns. E. SCYTHIA AND RELATED CIVILIZATIONS The stag was elevated to the position of a holy animal by the Scythians who were famous as the iron age neighbors of the Greeks. 51 The prominence given the animal might be explained by Scythian contact with the Hittite pantheon. It is more likely, however, that it stems from a tradition which extends back to the prehistory of the Eurasian Steppes. 45 C.

I9</page><page sequence="33">With the Scythians, the cervid image shifts from stag to moose. Occasionally the ram is admitted as a substitute. As the golden sun animal, the stag "proceeds through the air spreading light which illuminates the mountain gorges".52 This combination of the luminous animal and landscape becomes a favorite subject in Chinese art after 600 A. D.,5 a phenomenon which should be listed in this chapter because the motif entered China from the steppes to the northwest during the Late Eastern Chou period. Horned animals are prevalent in Scythian art as we know it from the VIIth to the end of the IVth century B.C. In spite of this fact, their territory in South and Southeast Russia did not employ antlers symbolically. To find examples, one must turn to the Altai mountains, to the far southeast of the O / Eurasian Steppe belt. Although this region is far distant from the shores of the Black Sea, 0 O 0 the culture and the arts of the Altai tribes have ) much in common with those of the Scythians.

Additional flat leather bands hang down from the temples and frame the eyes. The antlers of Kurgan 11 imitate those of a moose or reindeer, as indicated by the 21</page><page sequence="35">partially palmate branches which distinguish both species. 57 Their painted ornaments include pear and triangle shapes, filled either with small dots or with triangles and lozenges. The latter contain a central circle on a dotted ground. The tips of the branches and tines hold tufts of red horse hair. It will be remembered that all points of the Ch'ang-sha antlers in the Museum of Natural History, New York (fig. i), are blunted and hollowed out. Evident- ly, bundles of hair, most probably also of a red color, had been glued to these parts of the antlers. Several writers who have discussed the hooded horse from Kurgan II at Pazyrik have overlooked the hanging leather bands. Hentze, however, has identified them as rams-horns.58 This suggestion is strongly supported by the fact that two different pairs of horns, namely those of stag and ram, adorn the heads of the twin protomes in the Cox Collection (fig. I o) and in the Chicago Art Institute (fig. 13). Five inverted pear shapes, each with a circle near the upper end, are used as decoration on the hanging-horn silhouettes. The lowest pair is flanked by narrow triangles. Four rosettes, each with a central circle, fill the spiraling ends of the horns. Other decorative elements of the head must be mentioned. It may eventually be dis- covered that they were included in the complex of those symbols which required horns. First, the nose of the horse is almost entirely covered by a fur cut-out of a bear seen from above. Then a felt casing, on which is pasted a file of leather silhouettes, conceals the mane. A comparison with similar Pazyrik patterns identifies these silhouettes as the crests of birds.59 The leather contraption was light and frail, and could not, therefore, have rested for any length of time on the horse's head. It could only have served for the duration of a funerary ceremony, and have had a meaningful connection with it. Nearly all discussions of symbolism connected with this hood have concentrated on the artificial moose or reindeer horns. The excavator of Pazyrik believed them to be a disguise; the horse was changed by this means into a reindeer, in remembrance of the latter's primordial domestication.60 Ac- cording to another, and more plausible, theory, the antler-crown converted the horse temporarily into the sun animal of the nomadic creation myth, and thus transformed it into a steed which was fit to carry the dead chieftain on his last journey.61 Hentze alone has 57 G.

F. GREATER INDIA Cervid lore abounds in South and Southeast Asia. According to Przyluski, this mytho- logical complex entered North India with the Scythians (a term which is obviously meant to include their successors, the Sarmatians) who were absorbed by the native inhabitants. He selected the Salva of the Upper Punjab for a special study. 63 They took over not only a nomadic racial admixture, but also the worship of a particularly holy and fabulous member of the deer species, called Sarabha. These people considered themselves as bound to the animal "by religious parentage" to such an extent that they became "mythically identical" with it. 64 When the earliest Buddhists assembled their legends, they drew upon a store of traditions, and incorporated no less than eleven deer symbols among thejiatakas, the tales of previous existences, during which the future Buddha accumulated merits. 6 Two cycles of Hindu mythology descend from the cervid stories. Przyluski listed them under the headings: ((Le cerf d'or)) and ((Le cerf d'or et le Cakravartin)) (ruler of the world).66 In them, one finds the ritual chase in which a man, disguised as a stag, is pursued by hunters, and the idea of the ruler who temporarily enters the animal body to achieve identity with the light-giving heavenly body. A cogent Siamese version of the myth 67 relates the union between a ruler and his consort at the end of the hunt, to beget a divine race of children of the Sun. Hiuan Tsang, the famous Chinese pilgrim of the VII century, observed a lingering of the mythological interrelation between man and stag. He reported that in the Kingdom of Himatala, south of the Pamir, women wore in their headdress "a wooden horn about three feet or so in length; it has two branches". 68 The earliest image of an Indian animal composed with stag horns appears on the back of the Western Gateway at Siachi. 69 There, some winged lions wear three-pronged antler-bonnets, attached by clearly delineated straps; others have two-pronged horns without 62 C.

At Amaravat, two-pronged horns rest on lion heads, without any securing device. They occur during the second phase (ca. ooA.D.),71 as well as during the third one (ca. 1 50 A.D.).72 Hiuan Tsang's remark about fashions at Himatala is con- firmed by the wall paintings of Eastern Turkestan.

These I century B.C. representations played an important role in the mythology of the Celts, who dominated large sections of Western and Central Europe during the first five centuries before Christ.

All of them represent the god of the underworld, Cernunnos, or his consort, with large stag horns growing out of their temples. On the rock relief of Val Carmonica, near Brescia in North Italy, which is attributed to the IV century B. C., 75 Cernunnos is shown standing - a rare occurence. The outstand- ing example of the numerous versions which depict the god in the "tailor's seat" is found on the silver vessel from Gundestrup, Denmark (fig. 27). It was probably produced between 1 oo B. C. and 50 A. D. by a workshop on the northwestern shore of the Black Sea. 76 The provenance of the vessel would account for the Asiatic motifs which are scattered over its surface. The head ornament and posture, however, cannot be included among these bor- rowings, for they are already known on earlier Celtic monuments. The powers with which the deity is endowed by virtue of antlers are summarized in an excellent monograph on Cernunnos. The antlers and other symbols are attributes of fertility in nature and fecundity in men and beasts.77 H. THE FAR EAST AFTER 200 B.C. The Chinese of the Han Empire (206 B. C. - 220 A. D.) inherited the gods of Late Eastern Chou, and must, therefore, have been acquainted with the divine potency of antlers. No such symbolism, however, is illustrated during the first half of the period. But, in the I-II century A. D., one finds stag horns in a setting which is reminiscent of the past. An example is seen on a stone relief from Sze-chuan, which depicts a man in strict frontality, described as "wearing an animal mask with horns". 78 The horns here shown are of the two- point variety. The antler symbol drifts gradually into spheres of lesser significance, a process which must have already begun in early Han times. This is indicated by a report of the period which mentions competitors in butting games who wear stag antlers affixed to their heads. 7 A pottery head, discovered in a grave at Suifu, Sze-chuan,80 may be dated at the end of the Han period, or slightly later. In addition to a two-point antler, the head has large, flaring ears; bulging eyes; tusks which descend from the corners of the mouth; and a long, hanging tongue, part of which has been broken off. Eyes and tusks of this nature have not 75 P. Jacobsthal, Early Celtic Art, Oxford 1944, vol. I, p. 3 and vol. II, pi. 217 a. 76 F.

The antlers eventually appear in a formalized con- text which is almost trivial and which contains only remote overtones of their former significance. A story dedicated to the glorification of filial piety will suffice to demonstrate the case. It tells of the parents of a young \ JVI man, T'an-tzu,81 who were afflicted with an eye disease 11 curable only by doe's milk.

If the later copy - possibly of the XII century - of a famous scroll by Ku K'ai-chih, in the Freer Gallery of Art, Washington, D.

A small, gilt metal plaque in the Museum of Far Eastern Art, Cologne, leads us to the V or VI century (fig. 29). It represents a frontal view of a man who wears ten-point antlers on the side projections of his cap. This symbolic device, as Hentze has shown, is now the mark of a shaman.85 The man and his dress, with this exception, are completely in line with representations of human beings; his calling is, therefore, identified unmistakably. Five-point branches form part of metal crowns, also of the V-VII centuries, which came to light in graves of southeast Korea.86 Since several were found in a single burial, they could not have formed part of the attire of a ruler, but could only have been the equipment of a sorcerer. 87 One sees these branches flanking three trees on such a crown drawn as it would appear unrolled (fig. 3o). Eberhard suggests that antlers as part of the equipage of Korean shamans derive from South China, since the latter has a stag cult. 88 His suggestion is confirmed by this study, since the Korean examples depend on the South China usage of antlers as symbolic components of the cult.

While antler-additions disappear in China before the beginning of T'ang, the motif is preserved in Japan in the decoration of helmets from the XV-XVI centuries on. 89 The Oriental Museum of Venice has a particularly varied collection of such armored headpieces. Some are adorned with real buck antlers and others with naturalistic or stylized reproduc- tions of such horns. 1. MEDIAEVAL EUROPE Early Christianity had little use for symbolic stag'horns. Only a few have been reported by Bober. 90 The ornamental page in the book of Bobbio, an Irish product of the VIII-IX century is one example. 91 It is part of the Celtic revival which took place in the British Isles in post-Roman times. The illumination has two elongated side panels filled "by two fantastic beings with human heads and interlaced stag horns".92 The ancient symbol has obviously become part of a playfully drawn decoration. Antler-like excrescences also branch off from human heads depicted on an ivory which adorns the Scandinavian casket in the Cammin cathedral, East Germany. This object originated close to i ooo A. D.93 Bober refers next to the north pillar of the church at Clonmacnois, Ireland, formerly assigned to the XII and now to the XI century. This monument must be eliminated from the category because the only human face shown wears ram's - not stag's - horns. 94 They are similar to the somewhat earlier "bound devil" on a cross shaft of Kirkby Stephen in Westmoreland, England.95 A page of the Stuttgart psalter, a German manuscript of the X century,96 shows a heavily horned man sitting in a cavern. The antlers and the surroundings identify him as a descendant of the Celtic god of the underworld. 89 O. Minsterberg, "Japanische Kunstgeschichte", vol.

Finally, the sinister turn of antler symbolism presaged already in the Stuttgart psalter, spawns into a complex representation of "Absolute Evil", a supreme Satan, shown in a French miniature of the XV century as a three-faced man with additional faces on breasts, knees, and the lower abdomen (fig. 3 i). 98 The head with its triple face is adorn- ed with three branch-like horns, the one in the center having five, the flanking ones four points. The tongues of the crowning heads and of the one on the abdomen will be discussed further on. Fig. 3 Miniature. French. XV century K. SHAMANISM AND FOLKLORE Figures endowed with stag antlers as tokens of supernatural power remained a pro- minent part of the shaman's attire in the northern backwaters of Asia. Their use continued almost to the present day, long after they had ceased to be used by the great civilizations of Asia. Primitive metal faces, crowned by antlers which are reduced to straight branches have been excavated from the region between the Ural mountains and Lake Baikal. 99 They are thus of some, though not considerable, age. N. C. Witsen (164-17 17), the Dutch diplomat at the Tsar's court, as well as con- temporary Russian explorers, illustrated reports on Siberia with engravings of Jenissei, Tun- gus, Samoyed and Buriat sorcerers. These wore iron reproductions of reindeer or roebuck horns on their backs or on their caps.100 Metal diadems with four arched bands which carry three tined branches on the vertex, some with split points, have been found in the Jenissei region.TM Sources dealing with the magic acts performed among the Tungus tell 97 C.

Bouquet tells how he first became aware of this kind of choreographic equipment by watching Tibetan performers at the British Empire Exibition of 1914. They wore masks surmounted by stag antlers. He then observed Scandinavian folk dancers who were similarly outfitted. Finally, he learned about street dances at Abbot's Bromby in England. The participants fetch their stag headgear from a storeroom in the village church.l08 Thus an object originally conceived as the seat of magic power adorns the heads of modern men for whom its significance has retired to the subconscious. VI. THE LONG TONGUE A. LATE EASTERN CHOU AND HAN CHINA Whatever the species of the original wearer of the antlers in the Museum of Natural History may have been, it may be assumed that its head was also furnished with a long tongue, because all Hunan wood monuments in a complete state of preservation are so equipped. Provision for such an addition is preserved even on the incomplete ones. Other images from the same site and period, of different material, have extended tongues but no antlers. If the close association between horns and tongues at Ch'ang-sha is considered, a description of tongued but hornless monuments from China and elsewhere seems indicated. A face made of white marble was found in Hunan (fig. 32).104 This medium was occasionally used for sculp- tures in this region. The face was apparently an independent unit, placed on the wall of a funerary chamber. It could be described as human, were it not for the two tusks which rise from the lower jaw. The tongue protrudes but does not assume the exaggerated length observed on the wood figures. To refer once more to the painted silk square from Ch'ang-sha,05 one finds among the images one bust 102 Vandier, op. cit., p. I40o. 108 A.C.

That the unreliability of the reproduc- tion makes further statement hazardous has already been mentioned. Another type of tongued being from Late Eastern Chou appears on a Fig. 33 Fig. 33 pair of bronze tubes. One is in the Detail of painted Guimet Museum, Paris (fig. 34), the other silk square China in the Heeramaneck Galleries, New York. Cna 7'~ ~ ~IV-III c. B. C. These are chapes for the feet of wooden staffs or poles. The silver inlay and the style of the patterns associate these objects with the finds from Loyang, which range in date from the late VI to the early III century B. C. 10 The figure constitutes the whole tube except for a chimney-like plain section at the opening. The image is composed of large elephant's ears, the forehead of a bald man, and human arms with clawed hands that are joined above the abdomen. A single leg is cover- ed by a descending wing on the thigh, and by scales representing feathers on the calf. The leg terminates in a flaring hoof. In addition, a curved tongue comes out below the nose and is flanked by the halves of the split lower jaw. The tongue reaches the upper edge of the hands. This creature can be identified because of its one foot as K'uei, the "monster of the woods", and, somewhat unrelatedly, as the "master of music". 107 Various texts list different characteristics of the being, and the name K'uei itself is applied to at least two different creatures. 108 Some Chinese and Western commentators as well overcome the impracticability of the single leg by explaining the fantastic creature as a stand for a drum. 109 The K'uei, certainly a descendant of ancient Chinese mythology, is recreated by the Late Eastern Chou artist in the 106 Andersson, op. cit., BMFEA, no. 7, p. 37. 107 B.

Thus, the master of music who governs song reveals his organ of sound, although no text authorizes this peculiarity. The Han period went even further in rationalizing the conspicuous display of human tongues. The pottery figurine of an acrobat, found at Suifu is an example.110 It stands on its head and extends a tongue of normal length, seemingly in jesting defiance. The same site has yielded other tongued human heads. 1" Since they have not been published, com- ment on their character and significance is impossible at this time. B. CHINA BEFORE 600 B.C. Examples of tongues which emerge from the mouths of tiger-like beasts are frequent features of the art of Shang and Early Western Chou. Their significance as symbols has been discussed by Hentze, who observes that the organ frequently bears a cicada on its surface. He then concludes that "the putting out of the tongue means conveying to light from the darkness of the mouth"."l2 The numerous illustrations which Hentze uses to support his contention prove that tongues shown in the earliest historic arts of China are rather modest in size unless they serve as stands for vessels. "1 Their length as well as their symbolic connotation differs from those of Late Eastern Chou tongues. The latter must then derive from another source. C. EGYPT The ancient Egyptians conceived the speech of the deceased in the same manner that they experienced the words of the living. As a consequence, the dead must have an open mouth and protruding tongue in order to make use of spells and to speak to the Gods. 114 The divine beings themselves are endowed with human organs for the articulation of sound. Thus Ra is eulogized: "Thou hast fashioned the tongue of the company of the gods". 15 The most exaggerated figure of thought has been construed with some reservations as to the correctness of the translation. It exhorts the king to use his tongue "as the steering-pole (?) of the boat of Maat", the divinity of truth. "l In representations of the Egyptian pantheon one finds only a single god whose tongue is sometimes visible. He is the god Bes. His many roles include those of a protector of 110 Graham, op. cit., pi. X. "1 Graham, op. cit., p. 99. 112 Hentze, Sakralbronzen, text p. 53, plates part I, fig.

He was supposedly unknown during the Old Empire, rarely mentioned in text and inscriptions of the Middle Empire, but prevalent in the New Empire, especially during the Saitic period. He was also considered to have come into Egypt from Africa, 18 or from Arabia. 119 However, the most recent research has led to different conclusions which are summarized by Bonnet. 120 Ac- cording to this author, Bes is a native Egyptian figure with deep roots in local prehistory. As he comes gradually to the fore, he acquires an apotropaic significance which motivates the protruding tongue. This latter feature of Bes therefore provides protection against evil spirits. His image is found on all kinds of furniture, especially on those which are used for rest. In the treasure of Tutankhamon his image is found on a state chariot, on a head rest, and on a cosmetic jar with a lid knob in the shape of a lion which also shows a protruding tongue. This object is therefore under the double protection of god and animal. 12 The image of Bes found its way into the arts of Asiatic civilizations at least during the V century B. C. It occurs on objects of the so-called Oxus Treasure, which is assigned to that period. While the ornament on a miniature chariot is not sufficiently well reproduced to permit comment, a gold phalera repeats all characteristic features of the dwarf's tongued face. 122 This was not the end of his eastward migration. Small bronze pendants in the shape of bearded and tongued heads have come to light from graves of the VII-X century A. D. near Minussinsk in the Jenissei Valley. 23 VWhile a remote Greek inspiration has been pre- viously suggested for this late revival of an ancient motif, the schematic rendering of facial hair points in the direction of Egyptian ancestry. D. CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY The arts of the Greek, Etruscan, and related civilisations have been searched for tongue bearing figures. The literature on this particular aspect of the problem under consideration is of such abundance that only a small selection of it may be consulted and quoted. The consensus of opinion is that all heads in Classical Antiquity which are basically 117 J. Hastings, A Dictionary of the Bible, Extra volume 5, p. I87a. 118 W. H.

Collection The National Museum of Villa Giulia, Rome human and provided with protruding tongues have an apotropaic and infernal significance. 24 Attempts have been made to attribute the sudden appearance of the tongue motif on the northern shores of the Mediterranean to influence from other countries, especially from Egypt.125 One may not in this case turn to the fountain-heads of antique mythology in Sumer, Iran, Assyria or Babylonia because even the most outspokenly apotropaic face from these regions, that of Humbaba, never shows the tongue. 26 Disregarding the possibility of Egyptian importation, Hopkins calls the appearance of this organ "possibly the first con- tribution of the Greek genius" to the formation of the frightening face. 27 It certainly can 124 E.

During the VIII century B. C., Greece effected a blending of two figures of its early pantheon, that of Gorgo, the consort of Poseidon, and of Medusa, the female demon slain by Perseus. 129 About a hundred years later, the face of the newly created image appears in art as an apotropaic device, at first with a closed mouth but soon with a protruding tongue of more or less natural length. This early Gorgoneion carries many overtones. The iden- tification of some of these figures as a male solar god'8? provides a better explanation of occasional bearded representations than does a reference to a lion's beard. 131 The Etruscans use a particularly impressive Gorgoneion in their arts, and the migration of these people from Asia Minor to Italy stimulated the unsuccessful search for Near Eastern prototypes of the image. 132 Versions of it on Italian soil are characterized by rather long tongues and by tusks at the corners of the mouth (fig. 3 5). These demoniacal signs are only infrequently found in Greece 133 where all emphasis on the frightfulness of the face subsides gradually after the VII century B. C. A few examples of symbolic tongues attached to animal profiles, and thus not apotro- paic in character, may be found on objects which belong to the northern and northeastern extensions to the Etruscan civilisation, that is, to those of Villanova and Hallstatt. There is first the bronze cauldron from Castelletto-Ticino, at the southern tip of Lago Maggiore, a region which participated in the Villanovan variation. 34 Montelius assigns this object to the V century B. C. The silhouette of a ruminant with panting tongue is repeated four times in the encircling band of figures. This image prepares one for the more striking and portentous representations on the bronze situla of Vatche in Yugoslavia which may be dated to about the same period as the Villanova cauldron. This situla has been known for a long time, and reproduced frequently as one of the most important Hallstatt documents. 185 The decoration is partly engraved 128 Kaiser Wilhelm II, Studien zur Gorgo, Berlin I936, p. 2I. 129 R.

The two upper bands depict religious processions, sportive competitions and drinking scenes, all parts of a funerary festival. Their orientalized character has been generally recognized. But the lowest figure belt of the situla has never been correctly interpreted. Certain Hallstatt objects show animals carrying food in their mouths. Since a lion with a leg of a hoofed animal is depicted on the lowest part of the Vatche situla, it was assumed that the three ruminants in the same section were holding branches of plants. Actually, this so-called branch is a long narrow band, rolled back at the tip, and covered by small knobs (fig. 37). It bears no similarity to the palmettes and other vegetative parts seen in the mouths of other Hallstatt ruminants. Even without the experience gained through the study of Ch'ang-sha wood sculptures, this rolled band should be called a tongue, and the knobs a sign for rain. The fact that the horns of males in the file are similarly embossed does not lessen the significance of the tongue pattern. The animals are suppliants for that water from the sky which is vital to the fertility of the soil and the fecundity of the species. This role, implicit in the motifs of the extended tongues and the patterns thereon, is in perfect accord with the death cult themes dominating the decoration of the situla. 36</page><page sequence="51">Fig. 37 Detail of Fig. 36 PLATE XII -&amp;.Mdmm .- . , -.1 somm. . -ARRILIM. - - -.- A&amp; .. -.. --i - . .. m low - - ", , - -- -- : . . --.2bimba- ?f -1. um-~ ai W~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Ut ils!- .. n-\</page><page sequence="52">E. GREATER INDIA With the exception of various finds from the prehistoric "Indus Valley" cultures - in several cases prophetically Hindu - the arts of India arose slowly during the III century B. C., that is, at a relatively late time. Religious symbols had taken shape in the texts, however, long before Indian images were formed in materials capable of resisting the destructive ef- fects of time. Very early, namely, in the Rig Veda, one finds: "Agni's tongue, the priestly voice, touches heaven".36 The same organ is also mentioned in a creation myth which must be of early origin despite the fact that the recorded version is fairly recent. The story reads: "Bhim pulled out his own tongue and stretched it out and out until it was a road fit for carts to travel, stretching from the underworld to the sky". 137 These tongued figures of the Vedas differ from those of the Mediterranean shores in that they do not convey menacing or frightful connotations. Such meaning, however, is not foreign to the Hindu pantheon. The Shandapurana, for instance, describes a terrible being produced by Shiva's wrath from between his own eyes. It roars like thunder, has "a face like that of a lion, a protruding tongue, eyes burning with fire, and hair flying upwards". 138 No less detailed is the record of terrifying characteristics ascribed to Dhanu, the personifica- tion of the bow: "He has a long tongue, and his mouth has terrible tusks; he licks con- tinually with his tongue the corners of his mouth". 19 Buddhist texts also make frequent use of tongue symbols. The twenty-seventh of the thirty-two major body marks of Buddha is his long tongue. 140 He can cover "mouth with tongue". 14 The Lalitavistara mentions a Bodhisattva who had an extended tongue because he wrote and recited sutras and disseminated knowledge concerning them. 12 All these flights of fancy seem moderate, when compared with those which describe he miraculous power of the Buddhist sermon. According to the Sukhivati- Vyuha, Buddhas are 4"covering with their tongues the world in which they teach". 14 Mention is made else- where that each of the ten Buddhas who resides at the ten points of space covers his in- dividual territory with his tongue, meaning that he preaches there. 14 136 A.

The flatness of the "strip" makes impossible the interpretation of it as a musical instrument, and its position directly below the crudely incised upper lip offers definite proof that it could not have been a beard. Although the identify of the being can not be ascertained, it must represent a Hindu divinity who bears a tongue. One must turn to the East to Cambodia in order to find a tongued figure which can be identified within the Hindu pantheon. The earliest monuments here are the shrines and stone lintels at Sambor Prei Kuk, dated as VII century. 148 A mutilated relief from a detached lintel from temple S-i of this site shows a man, richly adorned, and five agitated hermits under a flattened cuspid arch of four foils (fig. 39).

The absence of a beak gives an unusually human appearance to the central Garuda of the prostrate Nagas in the spandrils of the arch.

He appears as an independent agent in the story of the theft Fig. 41 of Soma,154 which includes the legend of the Prince Section of a stone pillar Jimuitavihana.155 The prince in the form of a Bhuitesvar, Mathura Naga offered himself to be eaten by the Garuda bird thus dissuading the latter from preying on snakes. Garuda repented of his cruelty and "brought nectar, and along the whole seashore he showered nectar from the sky". The story goes on to disclose that Jim-utavahana was then seen with his human body restored, and that his relatives rejoiced in him. The depic- tion of the locale, explicitly described as the seashore, may have been lost with the lower part of the lintel, and the central figure of the scene may be the reconstituted prince. Can the bearded sages be considered as his relatives? If one accepts the lintel as a unique re- presentation of the Jimiitavihana legend, the right hand of the central Garuda must have held an inverted vase from which he poured the nectar, while his extended tongue proclaims his repentance far and wide. An architectural detail of India and especially of its eastern cultural extensions falls oc- casionally in the category of tongue-bearing images. This is the full face Khirtimukha, the "face of glory" which received different names in different parts of Indonesia. 156 Originally associated with Shiva and used as his emblem, this face occurs in Buddhist decoration from the VI century on. It apparently has no special significance, 157 except as a prophylactic charm. As such it is frequently considered a derivation of the Greek Gorgoneion or of the Chinese T'ao T'ieh. A blending of an originally Indian concept with another imported from China is suggested by the fact that the "face of glory" occurs more frequently in Southeast Asia and its archipelago than it does in the Indian motherland.158 The southeastern 158 G. de Coral-R6musat, L'Art Khmer, Paris 1940, pl.

They borrowed, among other motifs, that of the Gorgo-tongue "darting forth",l61 in order to illustrate the horrors of Mara's, the Buddhist Satan's, army assailing Shakyamuni in his meditation under the Bodhi tree. Stucco heads found at Hadda in Afghanistan de- monstrate the free manner in which the fantasy of local sculptors dealt with the infernal tongue symbol. Some of the heads of the demons in Mara's retinue have tongues of mo- derate length. 162 One of these tongues ends in a cluster of leaves, considered by Barthoux to be the representation of lungs,163 while the longest one is pulled by the hand of its owner.164 The long tongue is used as a demoniacal sign in the representation of one of the jatakas, the tales of the Buddha's former existence. This story relates his incarnation while still a Bodhisattva as the flying horse, Balaha, that saved the lives of five hundred merchants. 165 Reliefs with different scenes of this legend adorn the back of a pillar from the Bhutesvar balustrade, one of the most important monuments of Kushan Mathura art, dating from the II-III century A. D. 166 On the lowest section of this pillar are two scenes showing the matrimonial experiences of the enterprising merchants on a far away island (fig. 41). In the upper register, they mingle happily with their consorts who reveal them- selves in the lower scene as raksasis, female demons ready and eager to devour their mates. This carnivorous desire is expressed by long, undulating tongues, striated lengthwise in the same manner as that of the Garuda at Sambor Prei Kuk (fig. 40). The writer knows of only one attempt in the arts of India to realize the exaggerated and propitious tongue symbols which appear in Buddhist Literature. One of the monoliths incised with the edicts by means of which Asoka propagandized the faith, the column of Rampurva, carries the date of 244 B. C. This refers, if not to the entire monument, at least to the inscription and to its capital. The latter is crowned by a lion which is seated on its haunches and has an extended tongue. 167 Since Shakyamuni is called "The Lion among the 159 H. Marchal, ?

Without actually referring to the tongue motif, Heine-Geldern has pointed out that the arts of the Dayak carry numerous style elements of Late Eastern Chou. 174 Later, the same author defined the Dong s'on region, and ultimately, South China, as the source of the early continental survivals found in the Malayan archipelago. 175 This theory is corroborated by the wooden sculptures from Hunan which are discussed in this study. The extended tongues on the heads on the memorial poles of Borneo, like those on the Ch'ang-sha images, signify a prayer to insure fertility and fecundity for the benefit of the living. F. CHINA AFTER 200 A.D. In Han times the Chinese artistic repertory gradually lost the ineeptthehuman and composite supernatural beings with extended tongues. Some animals seen in the following period of Three Kingdoms and Six Dynasties (206 A. D. - 550 A. D.) however, are still provided with such exaggerated organs. They continue to appear for several centuries, but in ever decreasing numbers. Comparisons between long tongues of Late Eastern Chou and those of the post- Han period reveal that after 200 A. D. one meets with entirely different forms which should be considered as new inventions. Shape and position clearly indicate that there is no longer any relation to the symbolism with which the tongue motif was associated during earlier periods. A stylistic trend already visible in Late Chou exerted influence in this period. This trend, a tendency to dissolve bodies and to add sweeping flourishes, appears especially in lacquer decoration, the most important two-dimensional art of the period. The principal motifs are animals in profile view. Although the painter depicted them with excessively elongated bodies and split limbs, he never included tongues among his elaborate forms, evidently because they were still hallowed symbols. In Han art, animal motifs continued to be presented in a playful manner, but tongues are seldom shown, and the occasional examples are very short. 17 The most advanced group of paintings in the Han style, those of the Painted Basket, are the only ones which may possibly be an exception. One of the long sides of the basket shows a galloping animal with returned head and a long, curving prolongation at the lower jaw.177 The latter resembles 174 R.

Omura, Kakko Zuroku, vol. II, pi. 46, I). But the object originated later as indicated by its shape, and the authenticity of its painted decor is questionable. 177 H.

LII, 3. 43</page><page sequence="59">chin whiskers more than a tongue, and the Painted Basket, moreover, may be a product of the III century A. D. The best preserved examples of Six Dynasties painting are found in scientifically ex- cavated graves in South Manchuria and in North Korea. These tombs were constructed during the V and VI century by the Kao Chii li, but are accepted as representative of con- temporary Chinese painting. The entire wall of a tomb is frequently given to an animal symbol of one of the Four Quarters. The painter feels free in dealing with these images to use long strokes for the dissolution of details which now include the tongue. A good ex- ample is found in the animals of tomb I at Sammyoli near Pyong-yang. 178 Here there are thin, oscillating organs at the mouths of the joined tortoise and snake, the representation of the North. The dragon of the East is provided with the flightiest and most elaborate tongue, while that of the tiger of the West shows the influence of the lion-tongue of the period to be discussed presently. During the following centuries, a long, thin, flowing tongue may adorn the painted dragon at any time. That this is true of sculpture as well is exemplified by the dais at Cheng Ting-fu, a Sung monument. 179 While the tongues of Six Dynasties stone animal sculptures and reliefs are as completely ornamental as the painted ones, they differ in being fleshy, gently curved, rounded at the tip, and marked by a median groove. The only animals outfitted in this manner are lions, of which some belong to funerary paths in the neighborhood of Nanking and are dated by inscriptions to the years 5 18, 528, and 529. 18 Tongued lions appear in front view on Buddhist steles, as for instance on the slabs of 518, 536, and an undated one of the same period. 181 Full-round survivals of secular character produced in Ming times decorate the Summer Palace in Peking. 82 During the VI century, the panting, fleshy tongue is also given to so-called "demons", composite figures which carry elements of fantasy and playfulness into Buddhist holy groups. These demons combine a heavy human body with a lion head, bird wings, and clawed hands and feet. The Boston Museum of Fine Arts owns the tomb-stone of a Lady Yuan, ten- tatively dated as of 5 24. 183 Its edges are decorated with flat reliefs of fabulous beings, each of which is identified by an inscription (fig. 43). Four of these figures are of the demon 178 Chosen Kofu Hekigwa Shii (Mural Paintings in old Tombs of the Kokuryo Period), Seoul 1916, pi. 20-23. 179 0. Siren, Chinese Sculpture, London 1925, vol.

MEDIEVAL EUROPE For St. Thomas Aquinas, the great theologist of the XIII century, the organ of speech was still connected with a pious significance. According to him, "the tongue of an angel is called metaphorically the angel's power". 186 The early arts of Christianity, however, ignored such edifying tongue symbols com- pletely, although some of their human or animal mouths eject forms of considerable length. Relatively short tongues in Christian art descend frequently from the Gorgoneion of Classical Antiquity. They adorn innumerable faces, especially during the XII century, for no other than decorative reasons. A capital in the cathedral of St. Pierre at Geneva, Switzerland, may be mentioned as a good representative of the type. 187 One of the most extended tongues of Gorgo derivation is known from the beginning of the century during which Romanesque 18 Information kindly supplied by Mr. L.

Near the center of the lintel, it meets the skull of a human face, couchant on its right ear, and then rolls out of the mouth, ending in front of a bird silhouette at the right. Although not actually characterized as a tongue, the tendril of Castel S. Elia takes the place of that organ in the mouths both of the animal and of the human head. At the end of the XI century, the tongue-like rinceau of Byzantine tradition reappears in Latio. It expands to fill a lunette on the facade of the hospital at Capranica. 19 While the use of Gorgo and tendril blended tongues gradually disappeared, early Christian art nevertheless effected a revaluation of the significances of ancient Asiatic ton- gues by transforming them into signs of evil. One of the earliest images of Satan covers an illuminated page of the Beatus in the cathedral of Gerona, Spain, a manuscript which is dated 975. 15 The ox-headed . and naked man is shown in profile with a long undulating - .i ; . ! i- tongue hanging from his mouth (fig. 45). : "Il^ From that time on, there is no end to infernal tongued figures until one reaches the picture of covetousness in ccLe Romant des Trois Pelerinages) in the library of Ste.

VII. CONCLUSIONS We have demonstrated in this study that there is little in the arts of Shang and Early Western Chou China, and nothing in those of Middle Chou, which could be considered a precursor of the horned and tongued image from Ch'ang-sha. The co-existence of these elements on a single monument is limited in space to Hunan province, and in time to the VI-III century B. C. This proves that the combination of antlers and tongues had never constituted an integral part of the native Chinese tradition. It must then be considered as the result of specific geographic and racial circumstances. Ch'ang-sha, the home of the twin symbol, was one of the main centers of the Ch'u kingdom. This state comprised the present provinces of Hopei, Hunan and Anhui. At times, it controlled both banks of the Yangtze River.202 From the VII to the V century B. C., it even dominated "considerable tracts of Southern, South-eastern and Eastern Honan",203 and was thus exposed to the impact of a purely Chinese culture in the North. Despite this tem- porary extension of Ch'u, all of its ever-shifting capitals were located south of the Yangtze, and the state remained an essentially southern power. In the course of the V century B. C. it became the sole, and for nearly two hundred years, the successful rival of the northern Kingdom of Ts'in, until the latter achieved complete victory, and with it, the unification of China in 2 3 3B. C. 20 The highly individual art of Ch'u is known chiefly through finds from Ch'ang-sha, Shou-chou, and other southern localities. It originated when the might of the southern state was at its height, that is, from the V to the middle of the III century. An analysis of the Hunan art style invariably substantiates this assumption. 199 Hamann, op. cit., p. 208. 200 V.

To test the validity of these disparaging statements, one must turn all the way back to the first historical period of China. Finds from islands near Hongkong, from the fringe of the ancient southern state, resemble objects dated as Shang and Early Western Chou so closely that they must be derivations of, and more or less contemporary with the art of central China. 205 In addition, some early bronzes and jades, supposedly of South Chinese origin, have been acquired by public and private collections. The correctness of the attributions is supported both by the patina and by certain details of ornamental decoration. Although the country south of the Yangtze appears, therefore, to have participated to a large extent in the artistic evolution of China from Shang times on, one can not disregard the insistence in the ancient texts that the tribes of Ch'u were racially different from the Chinese stock. It seems that branches of the Tai, among others, constituted an important component of Ch'u. The rise of independent political power in the South may well have been the cause for peculiarities of style and symbolism which became, from the V century B. C. on, more strongly marked than ever before. One individual feature of the Ch'ang-sha finds is the use of large wooden sculptures as protectors inside the sepulchral chambers. They all represent guardians. The Cleveland Museum of Art's group of two addorsed cranes which stand on two intertwined snakes is an exception, however. 206 The cranes are associated with fire and long life. By means of magic dances they are able to catch snakes. 207 These special functions and powers may be responsible for the elevation of the group to the function of a grave monument. The bodies of other guardians are without exception limited to their upper parts. Those in human form (fig. 5-7) represent sorcerers, magicians, or shamans, who receive their superhuman authority from the stag horns on their heads. This contrivance enables them to ward off evil spirits, to guarantee continuous existence, and to bring the sun's creative energy into the lodging of the dead, not only at Ch'ang-sha but in the Altai mountains as well. In the contemporary life of China, the dancer wore an antler crown (fig. 19) which endowed him with fecund energy and which enhanced"the supernatural control over the forces of nature", 208 already assured by the rhythmical movements of the human body. Such antler dances survive to the present day, although their meaning has long disappeared from the consciousness of the performers. 205 W.

Since the dawn of Chinese history, the feline has been considered to be the progenitor of the race. It assumes the functions of a protector, and is endowed with magic power by means of the added stag-antlers. In one example, the antlers are replaced by the equally potent horns of the ram (fig. 16-17). The twin protomes of Ch'ang-sha as well as the contemporary or slightly earlier horse head from Pazyrik (fig. 25) are rendered doubly powerful through the simultaneous presence of stag and of ram's horns. The practice of grafting horns onto heads which nature had not provided with such adornments spread across the southern border of China to the Dong so'n region. There, the doe receives antlers so that it can repel evil spirits as effectively as does its male partner (fig. 22). The guardians of Ch'u graves, whether sorcerers or felines, take care of the dead and of the living in more than one way. Because their wards are farmers who depend on nature and on the regular sequence of seasons, they have to secure fertility of the soil, especially through rain. To do this, human and animal figures emit long tongues, distinctly in sup- plication for water from the sky which is represented by dots, not only in South China but also in the somewhat earlier Hallstatt culture of Central Europe (fig. 37). Pear shaped drops on head and arms (fig. 14) or on arms alone (fig. 9) have at Ch'ang-sha the same function as the dots. Sericulture is of special concern to the Ch'ang-sha farmer. He needs the leaves of the mulberry tree to feed the silk worms. He thus has the leaves of that tree painted on the sides and back of an animal guardian in the colors of precious metal (fig. 17). One finds other references to the leaf harvest in Late Eastern Chou art. Scenes on several bronze vessels include people dancing, performing a human sacrifice and collecting petals. 209 Inter- est in the thriving of other vegetation is shown by the placement of a tree-planting scene near that of a fecundating dance (fig. 20); possibly by the leaf border of a wooden base (fig. 14); and, most strikingly, by the representation of people kneeling at the sides of trees and moving about with branches in their hands (fig. 48). Antlers continue to exist in the Far East as part of the shaman's equipment from the end of Han up to the VI century. Later on, they retain this function almost to the present day in the steppes of Northern Asia. In Japan, they linger for some time as a dimly pro- tective helmet decoration. 209 Vandier, op. cit., p. 135, fig. 2. S. Umehara, Etude des Bronzes des Royaumes Combattants, Kyoto 1936, pi. XCIII.

Brundage, Chicago PLATE XV</page><page sequence="69">The belief that magic powers could be acquired by the wearing of antlers goes back to the Palaeolithic. It lasts through the Mesolithic and Neolithic until it reaches the threshold of history. The question remains: What is the geographical source of antler symbolism in the form manifested at Ch'ang-sha, and how did it reach the southern part of China? Its r6le in the ancient civilizations of the Near East was insignificant. It had not loomed large in earlier Chinese history. In a final analysis, the Sarabha myth and the horned felines of India, such as those at Sianchi (fig. 26) and AmaravatT must be the source of the antler crowned figures from Ch'u, even though visual manifestations on Indian soil follow the Chinese ones in time. The conclusion has been reached concerning a similar problem of origin that the Indian prototype of a Chinese motif was "literary rather than visual", and that the Chinese artist had never seen a material realization of the Hindu myth. 210 European antler symbolism is at best contemporary with, and more frequently later, than the Chinese manifestations. It plays a prominent r61e only in the pantheon of the Celts, with Cernunnos, the god of the underworld, as its main representative. This figure cannot, for the time being, be connected with the shaman of the East. Cernunnos might be responsible, however, for the more or less playfully applied antlers of early Christian art, traceable in England, Germany, and Italy. A faint repercussion of Far Eastern antler significance seems to have reached Europe during later medieval times, probably not by way of the Siberian steppes. What happened then has many parallels in the history of symbolism. They came from the East, but "instead of being used to illustrate the holiest, they were transformed into its opposites, such as evil and the personification of the devil". 211 Thus originated the French miniature of the XV century with a triply horned and incidentally slightly tongued Satan (fig. 31). The origin and fate of exaggerated tongue symbols differ considerably from those of the antlers. The organ of speech is a late-comer among the meaningful emblems of antiquity. It occurs first in an extended form on the Egyptian god Bes. In early Greek art, it changes from a godly to the frightening device of the Gorgo. Provided with this apotropaic cha- racter, and stretched out to a greater length than in Greece, it reached India (fig. 41), where a tongue symbol of propitious significance already existed. The apotropaic form even reached Ch'ang-sha as is illustrated by a single example (fig. 3 2). Early Christian art makes considerable use of the Gorgo tongue. As a decorative device it lives on in heraldry and folklore down to the present day. The vast majority of tongues observed at Ch'ang-sha, however, differs from those of Bes and Gorgo in having an extension unequalled in other ancient arts. Such organs existed 210 A. Salmony, "The Magic Ball and the Golden Fruit in Ancient Chinese Art", in K. B. Iyer, Art and Thought, London 1947, p. I05. 211 W. Kirfel, Die Dreikopfige Gottheit, Bonn 1948, p. 158. 51</page><page sequence="70">only as figures of thought in India before a Chinese image maker gave them form. He was the first to materialize "a tale", making it "an object of propitious and protective value". 212 Only at Ch'ang-sha, and only during the first three centuries of the second half of the last millenium B. C. did it become possible to match Indian fantasy with Chinese art realization. Thus shamans, felines, and K'uei, the master of music (fig. 34) acquire extended tongues, either as an invocation for rain, or as the manifestation of a powerful voice. The only other prayer for water rendered visible by the representation of long ton- gues is known from Hallstatt (fig. 37). In this connection it should not be forgotten that Heine-Geldern has suggested that tribes of Central Europe migrated to South China before the VIII century B. C. 213 Although extended tongues live longer in the Far East than stag antlers, they become meaningless much sooner. In Europe, tongues derived from the Gorgo or blended with a tendril (fig. 44) enter early Christian art as decorative embellishments, occasionally with reminiscences of pre- Christian beliefs. However, Satan, the supreme Evil (fig. 45), and Babylon, the city of sin (fig. 46-47), offer the Christian artist the opportunity to create human or partly human images with tongues that rival in length those from Ch'ang-sha. Eventually, in the case of Babylon, the tongue is identified with monstrous animals. These sinister representations may possibly have originated from a faint reflection of the glorification which India had associated with tongues of fabulous length. Although stag antlers and extended tongues pertain to two entirely different cycles of mythology, both existed in India, most frequently as figures of thought, sometimes also as artistic manifestations. India had never combined the two on one and the same image, while South China accomplished their fusion, in addition to using them individually. At Ch'ang-sha the signs "of light and voice" were joined in a combination which Mus finds "sensible".214 This study thus adds two examples to the growing list of Indian influences on the civilization of Late Eastern Chou. The enumeration of these influences began long ago with the equation of Yoga and Taoist exercises for the attainment of supernatural abilities. 215 Then fairy-tales and marvels of the Chinese "Mountain and Sea Classic" were traced to In- dian prototypes. 26 Finally, it has been suggested "that some motifs in Europe and China go back to common Indian sources ". 217 This study has demonstrated that the Chinese use of stag antlers and extended tongues is of Indian origin. 212 Salmony, op. cit., p. 105. 213 R.
