<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reading the Language of The Dinner Party CAROL SNYDER Conceived by Judy Chicago and realized with the help of over four hundred women and men, The Dinner Party is a vast triangular banquet table, set for thirty- nine great women of Western civilization. Each woman is represented by an individualized porcelain plate that rests on a richly decorated fabric runner. The table rests on a triangular Heritage Floor made of triangular opalescent porcelain tiles, on which the names of 999 additional women are inscribed in gold.... Using with deliberate irony the traditional arts of women, Judy Chicago has celebrated in non-traditional ways the feminine presence from our collective past to the present day, from the Primordial Goddess to Virginia Woolf and Georgia O'Keeffe. The Dinner Party, brochure (University of Houston at Clear Lake City, March 8-June 1, 1980). Because Judy Chicago's monumental work, The Dinner Party, breaks so many conventions for "high art," discussions of it typically focus on its radical feminism arid scant its aesthetic coherence. Audiences applaud or impugn its significance, often without regard to its merit as a work of art. While insisting that she means her work to cross traditional boundaries and reach an audience (mainly women) that "elitist" art does not cultivate, Chicago knows that the multivalent symbolic language of The Dinner Party forms can be misread by that audience. During an interview the artist acknowledged the risk: People bring their own skills at reading language to reading language, skills at understanding poetry- meter, rhythm, imagery. If you're not skilled you read it on one level, if you're more skilled you begin to read it on another. And generally we are illiterate visually, which is one issue that I'm trying to address, and secondly, it's a new language. And it's women who are hungry for a language and for forms, and they want them to be everything they want them to be.' Chicago locates the danger of miscomprehension in external conditions: an audience unfamiliar with art language, feminist viewers impatient for affirmative symbolic action in art.2 While contextual factors clearly have a bearing on responses to the work, attention to them may have distracted notice from the problems inherent in the "text"-the symbolic form that is The Dinner Party. Chicago's aesthetic vocabulary has been insistently literary. As early as 1973, she and Miriam Schapiro championed a "female form language"3 which they discovered in "the predisposition in women's work towards centered forms." In the process of generating her own centralist language, the urgent need to articulate her personal commitment to feminism drove her to write on her work in a way since made familiar by Conceptualism. For all their radical eclat, early works like The Great Ladies (1973) were half abstract image and half manifesto. This measure was a stopgap: When I first started writing on my work I didn't know how to make the images more specific and I was struggling with my heritage as an abstract artist; I was trying to figure out how to not sacrifice the quality of that tradition while making the images more accessible; I was trying to expand my audience. Yet Chicago did not repudiate writing as she refined her forms. Her literary energies were first channeled into the writing of Through the Flower: My Struggle as a Woman Artist, and then into two books v hich grew out of The Dinner Party project, both of which serve as documentation for and guide books to the piece.4 The Dinner Party both separates writing from imagery and brings them together again in a new alliance. Explanations of the images are confined to The Dinner Party books where the names that are written on each piece are designed to operate visually. The separation between images and contiguous written cues to their ipeanings points to Chicago's virtual disappearance into her visual language. Yet if in one way the fusion of self with forms leaves the forms more exposed than before, in another way the sustaining format-Chicago's version of woman's cultural evolution-serves the same purpose as writing by providing a delimiting framework for meanings. Like the poet Adrienne Rich, Chicago espouses a recovery of feminine-oriented mythology and, with it, women's myth-making powers: "The Dinner Party suggests that women have the capacity to be prime symbol-makers, to remake the world in our own image and likeness." The amibition of the piece necessarily places an enormous burden on its prime symbols. Beyond the</page><page sequence="2">Woman's Art Journal 31 specificity and accessibility Chicago hoped to give all her symbols, in The Dinner Party they must work together to illuminate her vision of women's history as achievement obscured. The guiding conception of the work rests on paradox and is embodied in ironic tensions, some more compelling and complex than others. The banquet table/altar, when shown as conceived, should glow in rich brilliance against an engulfing blackness-a unidimensional metaphor for women's radiance and historical obscurity. The table is set for absent guests who are nonetheless present in linen and china emblematic portraits. One of Chicago's early slogans for the piece, "Twenty- Five Women Who Were Eaten Alive," points to her conception of the guests as "contained within domesticity, served, and ready to be consumed."5 In its final state, this bitter, rather Pop pun is subsumed in the Eucharist metaphor; and the whole, with its hieratic iconography, its gilded ecclesiastical splendor, and its oversize chalice/goblets, nearly transubstantiates the profane (the historical and sociological content) into -the sacred. Visitors who sense the sacred aura converse in whispers as they "triambulate" the piece, kept at a reverent distance by an altar/guard rail. This devotional attitude, while it surely testifies to women's need for images which affirm them and Chicago's success in "making the feminine holy,"6 works against perception of the piece's ironies and its occasional light touches. At every level the symbolic field of the work is crowded with competing significations-some expository, some ironic. The equilateral triangle, interpreted by Chicago as reflecting "the goal of feminism-an equalized world," is also a centered form recalling "one of the earliest symbols of the feminine."7 The relation of the plates, runners, and foundation floor is pyramidal and thus repeats the geometry of the table and the triangle motif in its cornerpiece white-work cloths. A floor bearing the names of 999 women supports a table set for 39 women recognized but insufficiently honored by our civilization. All present a straightforward structure for women's reliance on the support of other women. The plates, which represent individuals, suggest in their shape the confinement of "a woman's sphere" but are painted and modeled to denote woman's efforts to rise out of that sphere. The degree of relief on the plates is a trope for relative success: the higher the freer. This simple equation is complicated by an irony, however, for the plates rest on worked fabric runners which are meant to recall the endless unregarded process of women's handiwork. At this level of abstraction, the ideas match their embodiments well. With some coaching-not a drawback for Chicago, since her mission is to educate around the work-the symbols can be seen to be specific and coherent. On other, more immediate levels there is some slackness. As an evocation of the passage of women's daily lives and a statement about the abasement of crafts in our fine arts-exalting culture, the runners are fairly easy to read. It is in their relation to particular plates that Chicago's language loses clear readability. In places (Mary Wollstonecraft's setting, for instance) the FIG. 1.

Photo: Beth Thielen. decorative detail of the fabric is designed to stand in jarring, ironic contrast to the more abstract forms on the plates; in others (the Sacajawea setting stands out) needlework and china painting are in accord. Some of these decisions seem fortuitous. There is a further, weaker tension between the regularized gold script in which each guest's name is woven on the outside of the runners and the more narrative and figurative elaboration of the backs of the runners. Unlike some of the other contrasts, this one appears to carry no feminist charge-with one effective exception: the Wollstonecraft runner, executed in the trivial stump work of the period, bears a sweetly decorative front and a shocking image of Wollstonecraft dying in childbirth on the back.</page><page sequence="3">32 Woman's Art Journal . : _ .. . . . ?. .

Because The Dinner Party plates carry most of the artist's radical message, they have drawn more fire than any other part of the work. Unlike the reassuringly serene, even mystical triangle she makes a female symbol, the round plates with their vaginal references force a confrontation with Chicago's female form language. Here the two main impulses of the work-to celebrate women and to protest their circumstances-find expression in the attempt to translate two traditionally female terms, cunt and butterfly, into terms of praise. The very presence of the vagina image is a reminder that in patriarchal cultures woman has been reduced to her sexual organs; the butterfly, a derogatory figure for vain, flirtatious women and for the ephemeral in general, suggests the slighting male version of the female spirit. Chicago's program for the images on the plates is to restore to them their full power as emblems of creativity and metamorphosis. To accomplish the transformation she has attempted to make both images in all their varieties "positive, powerful, thrusting, aggressive, assertive female forms." One of the interpretive problems with the program has to do with the matching of the butterfly and vagina images. When I asked Chicago if she had superimposed the butterfly on her more organic, genital forms to avoid the charge that representing women as vaginas reduced them, I had in mind the overlay of an image for the soul on a body image. In her reply she stressed that for her the two images are equally involved with the metaphysical. The butterfly image, which she has used since the late sixties, is "an image of liberation and resurrection" but "the feminine can also open the doorway to the spiritual... the vagina can be a gateway to the universe." In fact, Chicago argues, the vaginal references in her imagery should be read figuratively: "For me, the exposure of the center is a FIG. 4. Judy Chicago, Aspasia Place Setting (1979). Photo: Mary McNally. metaphor for the exposure of self... the opening up of the center, the exposure of the core, is at the base of my work." The butterfly shares with the vagina a central core, and is also ... a natural, an anthropomorphic form; it's a body form, a body gesture. If you think about Leonardo and that famous image of the male universe, you can invert that and you make a female form, except, you know, it flies. In the plates as elsewhere in the piece there is some strain in the match between concept and realization. On the first two wings of the table the labial folds and striations of the vagina image most often appear as abstracted and flat designs. Sometimes they disappear into floral or pod-like shapes, leaves, drapery, or flames. The butterfly form is depicted in outline, and many of the plates also make distinct iconographic allusions. The Theodora plate (Fig. 1), for instance, works the butterfly- vagina form in low relief incised like mosaic so that the pattern of the tiling absorbs both labial folds and wing markings. The female form language remains fairly rhetorical, and one tends to read these plates as symbolic portraits. The imagery, however, is not always sufficiently specific for that purpose. A sequence of three oddly similar plates on the first wing of the table, composed of the Judith, Sappho, and Aspasia portraits, shares a petal/leaf motif along with the butterfly-vagina form. The Sappho design alludes to the poet as "flower of the graces."8 Since there seems to be no particular historical reason for extending the motif to the other two figures, one is thrown back on the general organicism of the imagery. When the imagery is specific, it can be too accessible: Eleanor of .Scj v r 14-- 4;-</page><page sequence="4">Woman's Art Journal 33 Aquitaine (Fig. 2) is a fleur de lis, and Petronilla da Meath, who was burned as a witch, is a kettle and candle. Both portraits also bear the impress of the centralized butterfly- vagina design. On the third, modern wing of the table, every plate after the initial one (Anne Hutchinson) is modeled, an indication that each woman represented rose in some sense out of her context. Here the "powerful... thrusting... assertive" forms appear in four clear instances (Mary Wollstonecraft, Susan B. Anthony, Margaret Sanger, Georgia O'Keeffe) as muscular butterflies, or conversely, lifting vaginas. But to describe them in this way is not to do them justice, for they are stranger and stronger than any terms for them can suggest. That Chicago manages to make this final sequence appear to rise at all is remarkable considering the weight of the clay worked in high relief. The contours twist, lift, and in the case of the Virginia Woolf image, break away from the plate altogether. Perhaps because they are so fully modeled, these forms impress themselves vividly on the imagination. Well- established by this stage, they take over in their own right and the question of how well they fit the women they represent seems less important than before. On this wing, too, the color scheme is bolder and more effective: the earth tones, lavenders, greens, and gilt of the earlier plates give way to voluptuous pinks, deep reds and blacks. The pen- line shading of many of the flat plates is largely replaced by darker tones in the fleshy convolutions of the forms, and several plates in the final sequence are fired to a sensuous high gloss. Here the body-derived imagery has a directness that is neither too obvious nor too broad. Some general considerations govern the disposition of the images on the plates and the specific shapes the basic central forms assume. In this sense, the language of the plates can be said to possess a loose grammar. The last two return to the designs of the first goddess plates and complete them. Woolf s plate echoes the fertile, seed-filled centering of the Fertile Goddess to Snake Goddess sequence, and O'Keeffe's plate, with its dark, open core, completes the Primordial Goddess design. In between there is a lot of variation in the treatment of both centers and edges of the circle and in the degree of abstraction of the imagery. Some of the plates depend on a particular iconography associated with the figure-the Amazon, Boadaceia (Fig. 3), Trotula, Petronilla da Meath plates-and others on a decorative idiom associated with the person and her period-the Isabella d'Este and Sacajawea plates. In these cases and in the case of the two most figurative plates, Sojourner Truth and Ethel Smyth, the images seem relatively harder-edged, less "infused with emotion," (Chicago's goal, she says in The Dinner Party book, for all the china paintings). Interested in why she chose to suspend the generative imagery in those instances, I asked Chicago if the fact that three of these women were warriors influenced her choice; I had in mind the Amazon, Boadaceia, and Sojourner Truth plates. Agreeing that there is a pattern there, Chicago explored its significance: ... all three of them have very specific iconographic references . . . Even though they're very different visually, there are certain connections in terms of the iconography that do repeat. They're all very strong, they're all very direct in imagery, and they also get increasingly dimensional as you go from the first to the second to the third. And they also become progressively more literal. . . . I'd say that does parallel very much my sense of history: first a mythical figure, then a legendary figure-the image is strong but flat because it's in the past. Boadaceia was a real woman, we know about her, but she's still not right out there; Sojourner's really rising up to the surface, she's part of her own modern history. On occasion historical idioms had to substitute for an intimate reading of character. Isabella d'Este "is so imbedded in the whole imagery of the Renaissance that I could not apprehend her as a single, individual woman." The same difficulty explains "why some of the earlier images are more generalized.... How do you find out what kind of person Aspasia (Fig. 4) was? And how do you even use Greek art.... What was I going to do, present her as like Athena, or the Venus of Milo?" The treatment of Ethel Smyth as a piano reflects an ironic intention. For Chicago, the Dickinson and Smyth plates, placed next to each other, make a pair: I myself find them fairly funny-funny and tragic simultaneously-but funny. And they're like polar opposites, the Smyth and Dickinson images. Either she's masculine, or she's totally submissive and feminine, the two opposite ideals or "numbers" of images of women. The Emily Dickinson image also fits another pattern, for like the Sophia, Hypatia, and Hrosvitha plates it shows a closed core, a sign of the contemplative female life. The tightness of the center points literally to the virginity of cloistered women. Referring to women in convents but including Dickinson as well ("Wasn't her room her cloister?"), Chicago says that the convent provided women a refuge, "someplace to aspire, to operate intellectually, spiritually, aesthetically, and to remain somewhat intact, although at a high price." Among the raised images distributed on the first two wings of the table are two with broken edges-the Hypatia and Petronilla da Meath plates. Chicago confirmed my reading of the broken edge as a reference to the violent deaths both women suffered, and added a third to the pattern: I do think that the point about Petronilla and Hypatia-and, actually, Mary Wollstonecraft, which is where the edge breaks again, really breaks, and then it begins to break steadily-is interesting, because she too died a violent death. I hadn't thought about that, but it's actually true. Chicago denies, however, that all such variants have significance: the atypical horizontal alignment of the central slit on the Caroline Herschel and Natalie Barney plates was introduced purely for the sake of diversity.</page><page sequence="5">34 Woman's Art Journal The language of The Dinner Party is experimental; the piece marks the first time such a language has been used with epic breadth. It may be asking too much to expect the symbolic and pictorial levels of the imagery to coincide in every case and for those two levels in turn to put us in imaginative touch with a distinct historical figure. That the piece so often succeeds in doing just that while elucidating the glory and misery of woman's history is testimony not only to Chicago's achievement but to the creative potential of specifically female form language. * 1.
