<plain_text><page sequence="1">72 NOTES ON DECORATED CLOTH IN SARAWAK: COSTUME, BELANTAN AND AN IBAN LOOM Andrew West This paper looks briefly at examples of decorated cloth from Sarawak in the collection of Merseyside County Museum, Liverpool. Ikat textiles are excluded from consideration here but have been dealt with in a separate paper (West 1984). Two items in the collection are of particular interest. The first, a belantan cloth, so-called by its collector, because it is a type little recorded for Iban society. The second, a partially woven cloth on a loom, because it was included by Ling Roth in his famous Studies of Primitive Looms (1918) and some annotations to his description are necessary. Decorated costume A variety of material was utilised for decorated costume in Sarawak; most decorated costume, including ikat fabrics, was associated with ceremonial, often centred on warfare and headhunting. Animal skins were used by men as warcoats. The whole skin of an animal was used. A hole for the wearer's head was made just behind the head of the animal, and the skin then worn with the animal's head flattened out on the wearer's chest. The four warcoats in Liverpool illustrate the range of animals used. These coats were all collected before 1902 by Charles Hose, administrator in the Sarawak Civil Service under the second Brooke Rajah, Charles, from 1884 to 1907. Three of the coats are Kenyah, of bearskin, goatskin and leopardskin, the other is Madang, of deerskin. (Ace. Nos. in order, 1956.26.21; 1956.26.22; 1956.26.17; 1956.26.24.) The Kenyah bearskin and leopardskin are decorated with shell pieces and hornbill feathers, the latter additionally having the edges bound with red cloth and some beadwork behind the wearer's neck. The black and white-barred hornbill feathers apparently signified the wearer was a tried warrior (Hose and McDougall 1912:1:163) probably meaning a successful headhunter. Ling Roth (1896:11:130) suggested that the skins were worn more for their appearance than for the protection they offered. Judging from illustrations (in Ling Roth 1896:1:5) skin seems also to have been used for the takei burat or 'seat mat'. The example in Liverpool,</page><page sequence="2">73 however, is made of basketry trimmed with cloth. These mats were worn by men, suspended from their waist - or loincloth to cover their posterior. The complex of headhunting in Borneo bears many resemblances to that of the Assam-Burma hills and this similarity was noted by writers in the nine- teenth and early twentieth century. But they seem not to have picked up the possible comparison between the so-called ftail! decoration worn by 2 warriors such as Nagas and Apa Tanis and the 'seat mat' worn in a similar position by Iban men. Barkcloth was used in Borneo to make jackets and loincloths. Two types of 'jackets1 were made: one of rectangular shape, sleeveless or with short sleeves, worn by men and women; the other a 'war-jacket', a long strip of barkcloth with a hole in the middle for the head. The latter type has resemblance to the warcoat made of skin (Kooijman 1963:71). A Kenyah jacket in Liverpool is made of barkcloth (ace. no. 1956.26.216), and was collected by Hose in the Baram District before 1902. It is sleeveless and the lower part is decorated with imported red cloth cut into wavy spikes. This dec- oration is of interest. Painted or stencilled patterns incorporating the human figure or other motifs were generally used on barkcloth warjackets or 'ponchos' which 'when reproduced photographically the clearly outlined, silhouette-like patterns thus formed give more or less the impression of paper cut-out figures' (Kooijman 1963:7). This impression must be similar to the effect of patterns made by decorating the barkcloth with cotton cloth. The method of pasting on pieces of cut cloth Kooijman reports for a cotton (not barkcloth) warjackets of the Menda lam-Kay an in Leiden Museum (1963:12). The barkcloth 'poncho' type of warjacket was associated with headhunting ceremonial (Kooijam 1963:9-12), but so also was the Mendalam-Kayan cotton warjacket in Leiden, according to its collector, Nieuwenhuis (Kooijman 1963: 12). Kooijman also examined the function of Mendalam-Kayan cotton jackets with pasted-on patterns in death ritual and suggested a similar association might be made for Kenyah 'poncho' barkcloth warjackets. But the style of barkcloth jacket in Liverpool was not mentioned; the decoration does not include the human figure, and so this type may or may not have been connected with headhunting or death ritual. Woven fabrics were used in a different type of warcoat - a quilted jacket. There are two examples in Liverpool. The first was collected by Rajah Charles Brooke before 1872 from the Iban. It is sleeveless, of</page><page sequence="3">74 imported blue cloth, has a collar and cloth ties and is filled with bark- cloth. (Ace. No. 1942. 11. (2). ) The second was collected by Charles Hose before 1901 from the Madang. This also is sleeveless but the back and front are not stitched together at the sides; the cloth has coloured warp stripes. (Ace. No. 26. 8. 1901 .9. ) These coats may have had a ceremonial purpose. Kooijman points out that 'clothing of this [cotton war jacket] kind in general were worn by the sons of chiefs when taking part in a headhunting party for the first time1 (1958:359). Photographs of women dancing and receiving severed heads show the men present wearing quilted warcoats (see Hose and McDougall 1912:I:Plate 106). Quilted cloth with a check pattern was often used for warcoats; the design has been associated with the check patterns on coats worn by warriors in Javanese society (see Gittinger 1979: 44). Beads, shells and buttons were used by various groups to decorate their fabrics. The one beadwork jacket in Liverpool (acc.no. 1944. 15) is poorly documented but has been identified as probably from the Maloh of West Kalimantan (see Gittinger 1979 and Maxwell 1979). The figures on the jacket possibly represent slaves. Gittinger (1979:225), illustrating a similar Maloh jacket, wrote that they fwere worn by women on festival occasions'. Maxwell (1979:133) writes that such a jacket (sleeveless and covered in bead- work back and front) is called a sape manik. A squatting human figure as depicted on the Liverpool jacket is called kaletau 'a common and obviously important motif . . . which probably represents a guardian spirit or ancestor figure1 (Maxwell 1979:134). Beaded costumes 'were reserved for the great ceremonial occasions when the longhouse would join together as a community to celebrate some significant event1 for example 'opening a new longhouse, marriage, death, the completion of a successful harvest, a return from a long journey' (Maxwell 1979:135). Woven plain cloths were produced not only in cotton but also in grass fibre. Liverpool has an indigo dyed 'grass' fibre woven skirt collected by Rajah Charles Brooke before 1872. (Ace. No. 1942.11.) Plain cloths were sometimes decorated with cowrie shells but the use of white buttons seems to have been preferred where they were available. A skirt collected by Brooke before 1872 is decorated with buttons and red cloth (ace. no. 1942.11) but shells were still in use around the turn of the twentieth century when Hose photographed (see Hose and McDougall 1912:I:plate 30) and collected a woman's skirt and jacket with a shell pattern . Such skirts with shell or</page><page sequence="4">75 button decoration were made by the Iban. Apart from the Iban, few peoples in Borneo (excluding Malays) were well known for weaving textiles. There are two jackets (of simple sleeveless form) and one skirt in Liverpool, apparently from the Dusun (or Kedazan) of Borneo. Similar cloth was used for each, warpfaced with coloured warp threads making a finely striped fabric. The back of one jacket is decorated with a string of Chinese cash. They were acquired via Norwich Castle Museum from Miss A.F. Gurdon before 1916. (Ace. Nos. 1956.26.331; 1956. 26.332; 1956.26.333.) The Iban are famous for their woven ikat cloths but they also worked patterns in supplementary weft, tapestry weave and embroidery. For example, tapestry and twining techniques were used to form the so-called 'badge1 or strip across the bottom of the back of an ikat jacket. The jacket was made of a single piece of cloth, folded, cut and sewn when taken off the loom. The badge was added before the cloth was removed from the loom, using the 'tapestry method of needle-weaving1 (Haddon and Start 1936:16). The 'badges1 were so-called by Ling Roth (1896:11:32) who thought of them as tribal identification, but as Gittinger (1979:223) writes 'The significance of these badges, if any, is not known'. There are three 'badges' in Liverpool, two on jackets (ace. nos. 1942.11 and 1948.19.7) and one on a cloth for a jacket taken from the loom (ace. no. 1956.26.212). A different method was used to decorate the ends of some of the waist- or loin-cloths worn by Iban men; this was the pilih technique, supplementary weft with the design reciprocated on the other side. The two waistcloths in Liverpool were both collected by Brooke before 1872 (ace. nos. 1942.11). Liverpool also has a cotton jacket of plain white twill collected by Brooke before 1872 (ace. no. 1942.11). This actually has warps of cotton and wefts of 'grass' fibre; it is edged with red and blue cloth and decorated with a few vertical and horizontal lines of raised embroidery done in coloured cotton with feather stitch. This jacket was recorded as Iban but might be similar to those described by Gittinger (1979:223) thus: 'the Kenyah, Kajan, and Bahau groups once wove impressive twill and twill-striped fabrics for kalambi on their back-tension looms'. Belantan In 1909 John Hewitt (Curator of the Sarawak Museum 1905-08) sold a</page><page sequence="5">76 collection he had formed in Borneo to Liverpool City Museum (now Merseyside County Museum). The collection came with a brief handwritten catalogue, and included a skirt cloth, a !belantanT cloth and a loom with cloth. The belantan Hewitt described as 'a garment worn by men on festive occasions. It is a good specimen of the most advanced kind of Sea Dayak weaving. The thread is bazaar material already dyed1 (Ace. No. 12.3.1909.35. document- ation). This Iban textile is made of machine-spun and commercially^ dyed brick-red coloured thread woven into a cloth about 2358 mm long and 427 mm wide including the warp border stripes of yellow, blue and pink. The main ground includes star and lozenge patterns with geometric designs and a series of anthropomorphic figures in rows at each end. The belantan is unusual on two counts; firstly as a named cloth and secondly in the techniques used in its manufacture. The latter was indicated by Hewitt when he described it as the most advanced kind of weaving. The use of the cloth is also of interest - worn on festival occasions - and it is useful to see whether such use is indicated in the name, technique or design. A garment called a belantan is not mentioned by Ling Roth (1896), Hose and McDougall (1912) or Haddon and Start (1936). Howell and Bailey (1900- 02) define 'belantan1 as !a staff1 but a Tpua belantan1 as fA Saribas cloth embroidered at the ends with figures etc. used as a sash1. (Pua is the common term for an ikat blanket: Saribas is a river along which Iban live.) This is a reasonable description of the cloth in Liverpool; unfortunately there is no indication whether belantan distinguished embroidered from ikat pua with human figures, or if this type of cloth had a particular use. Richards1 recent (1981) dictionary gives more information. Belantan is derived from Lantan which has several meanings including rod or staff of office (1981:182). A belantan was formerly a 'reserve of land owned by a chief1 or an 'extra share of honey given to those who climb for it (1981:37). A pua belantan is 'a cloth made in the Saribas with embroidered ends for use as a sash' (1981:37) and a 'figured red cloth made in the Saribas and used as a sash' (1981:182). Under pua, 'a blanket, coverlet, sheet, cotton cloth', Richards' notes that chiefly poetical names for fine pua include belantan and bali belantan (1981:287). Bali belantan is defined as 'patterns or kinds of ritual cloths' (1981:24) and bali as sweet smelling. Thus belantan is a poetical name for a fine cloth, it is a Saribas Iban sash embroidered at the ends with figure designs and it is a kind of ritual cloth: the precise meaning apparently defined by the preceeding word.</page><page sequence="6">77 The embroidered figures are of interest in design as well as technique. The cloth is plain weave, no more complicated than that of Iban ikat textiles, so presumably it was the added decoration that led Hewitt to claim this as an advanced example. Haddon and Start suggest a number of methods for prod- ucing non-warp dyed designs (1936:14-19). One applicable here is the 'use of free spools, used to pick up threads when needed and then allowed to hang from the web until required again; the weft passes across the back of the cloth from one motive to another.1 Commenting on this technique they added 'This is a method used by the Malays and is much more difficult than embroidery, and as the Iban do not often use the tenjak [frame loom] for their weaving but prefer their more simple tumpoh [backstrap loom], it seems reasonable to suppose that they would choose the easier method in working the raised type of pattern1 (Haddon and Start 1936:14). It seems with the belantan that the repeated designs of lozenges and stars were added whilst weaving was in progress with this method of 'free spools'. The patterning could have been further complicated if the technique of laze rods suggested by Ling Roth (see under loom below) was actually in use. The human figure^ on the other hand, were probably added by a sungkit technique of wrapped supplementary weft which produced identical figures and designs on both sides of the cloth. These methods of decoration (further discussed below with the loom), perhaps coupled with the use of 'bazaar' thread, seem to be the reason for Hewitt's description of the belantan as the 'most advanced kind of Sea Dayak weaving'. The human figures form an important part of the design. Headhunting played an important role in Iban society and many textiles were associated with ceremonies connected with it: Freeman (1979:239) wrote that ikat fabrics 'commonly depict the feats of headhunters' . Haddon and Start (1936:46) discussing a jacket with embroidered figures wrote 'It is somewhat rash to speculate upon what occasions a kalambi [jacket] of this sort would be worn, but some of the embroidered figures seem to indicate that it was associated in some way with headhunting'. The figures on the jacket are not dissimilar to those on the belantan save on the latter they are not carrying or linked to anything immediately recognisable as heads. Haddon and Start refer to human figure designs as engkaramba, based on the labels attached under the direction of Charles Hose. On one cloth the engkaramba was described as 'a figure used to keep off harm' (Haddon and Start 1936:124). Haddon from his notes recorded that 'only women belonging to ancient and honourable families may make engkaramba and even they must begin by making other</page><page sequence="7">78 patterns' (Haddon and Start 1936:124). Freeman, however, describes Iban society as egalitarian and so it is more likely that only the wives and daughters of important men (rather than chiefs) had the right to use designs of human figures; perhaps the men had to be successful headhunters. The anthropomorphic figures thus seem to suggest a link with headhunting, but a possible use of this cloth is given by Gittinger. She illustrates two cloths of similar size to the belantan decorated in the sungkit method, one including two human figures on a red ground. These are shoulder cloths worn by women at feasts such as 'Gawai Kenyelang or Hornbill Feast1 and 'formerly they were used on these occasions by the women as slings to carry the trophy heads that were essential to the success of rites in honour of Singalang Burong, the god of war and headhunting' (Gittinger 1979:227). As on one of Gittinger's illustrated cloths, the figures on the belantan are possibly wearing feathered headdresses. However, the definition of bali belantan as a kind of ritual cloth indicates that the belantan was not necessarily limited to headhunting ritual. This is underlined by Haddon 's note of engkaramba warding off harm. Haddon and Start discuss one jacket in the Cambridge collection on which are embroidered rows of human figures. They suggest that it belonged to a manang and probably a manang bali, (1936:45). A manang is a shaman and a manang bali is a transvestite shaman. Haddon and Start offered no evidence for this shaman link other than the importance and use of engkaramba. A further tenuous link between shamans and the belantan might be proposed in connection with the bali belantan and the manang bali. There is little hard information concerning this belantan cloth, save Hewitt's own description which was written at a time when technology, being connected with evolution and diffusion, was more important than use for anthropological theory. However, the name, the technique and the design all unite to make the cloth stand out. The design probably has association with headhunting and keeping off harm. The technique was not common, the most popular method of decoration being that of ikat (see Chin 1980:57). The name indicates both a type of cloth (from Saribas, red with embroidered figures) and a use (a ritual cloth). The loom The one Iban loom with cloth in Liverpool (ace. no. 12.3.1909.22) was included by Ling Roth in his Studies in Primitive Looms (1918:64,67-68) with</page><page sequence="8">79 a drawing and comments. Ling Roth's sections on Borneo looms noted five which he had examined; one Dusun (Kadazan) and four Iban. Curiously the cloth on each (for an Iban loom anyway) has an exceptionally narrow web, about half the width normally required for most ikat textiles. Haddon and Start noticed this (1936:12) 'the examples [Ling Roth] describes seem to be for exceptional pieces of cloth which average less than nine inches wide and vary from thirty inches to twenty-four inches in length. These are much narrower and shorter webs than any used for the clothing usually worn or than any of the cloths we have examined.' For the Liverpool example at least there is an explanation. Hewitt, the collector, described it in his catalogue as a 'Model of a Sea Dayak loom'. This was also entered in the accession register, but a pencil line was later drawn through the words 'Model of a'. It would seem that Ling Roth erroneously understood the loom to be full size. Haddon and Start (1936:12-13) were also concerned about the method of patterning on the Liverpool loom cloth as described by Ling Roth. Before proceeding to this, it must be noted that it is not really possible to check Ling Roth's findings on this patterning method; the loom was damaged, probably at some time during the movement of the stored ethnographical collections which survived the fire that destroyed the museum in 1941. Most of the threads are damaged and the warp beam had been replaced by a chair leg. Part of the loom is drawn by Ling Roth (1918:68, figure 125) to illustrate his argument that the series of five laze rods between the shed stick and warp beam (at the warp beam end) were inserted to facilitate weaving in a lozenge pattern in supplementary weft. But he also acknowledges that 'There is another figure pattern further away (not shown), which does not agree with this warp laying.' (Ling Roth 1918:67). This presupposes altering the position of the laze rods for each band of lozenge decoration. Only about one-sixteenth of the web on the loom has been woven. This contains five broad bands of design and, therefore, if the model is accurate, indicates that they would normally be added while weaving was in progress. Three bands are in differing lozenge-based patterns done in gold and silver thread. The other two bands, in white, blue and yellow cotton, have patterns resembling those on ikat textiles; they are based on angled lines character- istic of Iban ikat with a certain similarity to designs categorised as insects by Haddon and Start (1936:plate XVII). There are also intervening narrow</page><page sequence="9">80 bands of lines or zig-zags. All of these patterns are worked wrong side up. The design that Ling Roth suggested was made using pattern laze rods was the lozenge band in gold thread, incomplete, nearest the heddle. Haddon and Start disagreed with Ling Roth over this 'Although Ling Roth has made a drawing (1918, p. 69) to explain how a pattern could be worked by means of laze rods, we do not know if the Iban ever use pattern laze rods. We are definitely of opinion that the pattern is produced by the sunkit method.1 (1936:13). Whether Haddon and Start examined the loom itself or based their comments on Ling Roth's book is uncertain. Haddon did go to Liverpool Museum at least once, to help with the Pacific collection in 1938 (West 1981); this was after the book was published, but it is possible that he visited before. Laura Start was working in Manchester and it is quite possible that she made the journey to Liverpool to view the loom. Their judgement could be correct and the lozenge pattern in metal thread was done using the pilih technique and the designs in blue, white and yellow thread using the sungkit method. Thus the lozenge pattern is reciprocated on the back of the cloth, but inversely, while the cotton pattern bands produced identical designs on the back, although the threads had not yet been cut. Haddon and Start called the pilih technique the brocade method and noted that 'gold and silver threads are usually used as weft by the Iban when they adopt this method of working a badge at the back of a coat, and the weaving is done whilst the warp is stretched in the loom.' (1936:17). Later on they wrote 'There does not seem any evidence that special weaving contrivances, such as pattern laze rods, have been used for these brocade patterns, and the process, in any case, is much quicker than that of the tapestry method.' (1936:17). But it remains possible that Ling Roth's description was correct and the pattern laze rods were an aid in brocade. The plethora of names for apparently similar methods need unravelling. It is interesting to note that the belantan, presumably manufactured at about the same time as the loom clotty used brocade for the repeated designs and sungkit for the human figures. When Hewitt described the belantan as an example of 'the most advanced kind of Sea Dayak weaving' he may well have been indicating the arrival of pattern laze rods. A problem in these discussions of technique is that few of the early</page><page sequence="10">81 authors seem to have allowed for, firstly, the contemporary introduction of imported but non-European methods, and secondly, that a variety of techniques could be utilised by a people at the same time. Thus, the development of weaving and cotton growing did not immediately end barkcloth production; the introduction of European buttons did not stop the use of cowries. The nineteenth century aim of classifying peoples required criteria; technology was one but is unsatisfactory. Development and exchange of ideas, alter- ation in trading patterns, all ensure some variation continually occurs in objects or their use and meaning over time. Notes 1. Material for this paper and for another on ikat textiles (West 1984) has been partly derived from a lecture given in May 1982 at a day school in Leicester. 2. The Naga tail is basically a basketry or wooden container decorated with dyed red goats hair and (preferably a womans) black hair. (See, for example, Hutton 1921.) The Apa Tani tail is made of 'strands of spliced cane [and] fits round the body and hangs down behind1 (Elwin 1959:106). 3. Some of Hewitt's collection was lost in the 1941 fire. The skirt cloth has ikat design and is considered in West 1984. 4. Both Howell and Bailey were roughly contemporary with Hewitt in Sarawak. William Howell was a missionary there around the turn of the century. He married an Iban woman and wrote several articles on Iban life and textile manufacture. D.J.S. Bailey was Resident for the Third Division of Sarawak, retiring in 1903. o. Hose was an avid collector and the fruits of his labours are in many museums. He supplied a collection of textiles with the designs named to Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology - the collection which Haddon and Start worked on and published in 1936. 6. Collection at Cambridge University Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology. 7# Pilih is defined by Gittinger (1979:228) as a 'supplementary weft technique but the designs of the two faces are reciprocal1 and sungkit as fa supplementary weft wrapping alternating with regular paired wefts. This technique .. yields a double-faced cloth1.</page><page sequence="11">82 References Elwin, V. 1959. The Art of the North-East Frontier Agency of India. Shillong: North-East Frontier Agency.
