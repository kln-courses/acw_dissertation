<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Concept of Method. GERHARD R. LOMER. New York: Teachers Col- lege, Columbia University. Contributions to Education, No. 34. 1910. Pp. 99. This little book is packed full of thought on the philosophy of method. The author believes that the stress on scientific method, while marking an advance in the progress of education, has too often led to an undue emphasis on the minutice of experience, and that consequently we have failed to attain to an organic view of the method of experience itself. 'For a consideration of the directions of the desires and habits of the individual, see Part II., "TTheory of the Moral Life," by John Dewey, in "Ethics," by John Dewey and James H. Tufts; and also Professor Dewey's "How We Think."</page><page sequence="2">412 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY A philosophical analysis of the method of experience at different stages of the development of the race and also at different stages in the life of the child would show underlying uniformities which should be determi- native of the method of education. The underlying point of view that determines the investigation which Dr. Lomer makes is dominantly that which Dewey has made familiar to us in his " The Child and the Curriculum," and in a less formal way in his " School and Society." The actual experience of the child is to be the starting-point in our discussion of the educational process. But ex- perience is not some sort of entity which we may watch unfold or de- velop. It is an activity, a process. The reconstruction of experience which we call its development and organization goes on in terms of the interaction between the child with all his infinite promises and unrealized potentialities, on the one hand, and on the other, the social media through which alone these can be realized. These two are the terminal aspects of the educational process. There has been a strong tendency tc view education in terms of one of these aspects dominantly, to the undue neglect of the other. If we fall in line with the organic and functional conceptions which are becoming current, we shall avoid this error and see that the fundamental method of education consists in the interac- tion between the two. The method of education must be conceived as identical with the method of experience itself, namely that of giving form to the experience of the child, only with the addition of such guidance and direction as will realize at the same time both individual development and social efficiency. The general plan of the book is as follows: to attack the problem of the method of human experience, which is also the method of education, through the analysis of several histor- ical systems of thought; to follow this by enough analysis of the theory of evolution to see the significance of the organic conception; and then to sum up in discussions of "The Interpretation of Experience" and "The Function of Method." The historical systems of the interpretation of experience chosen as typical for this study are those of the Greeks, Bacon, Descartes, Comenius, and Kant. The Greeks analyzed almost every aspect of human experi- ence, the nature oI the universe, the nature of man's experience, and the problem of human conduct. The author's discussion of the Greeks culminates in the philosophy of Plato, in which the method of experi- ence is conceived as that of realizing through definite stages of progress from ignorance to wisdom the ultimate "Ideas." This method of ex- perience is determinative, then, for Plato of the method of education. It is hard to understand why the author did not touch at this point upon Plato's account of education in the "Republic," and show in what re- spects it conforms to his analysis of the method of experience. It is interesting, however, to find him departing from the conception of Plato's philosophy as wholly static, and finding in it a dynamic and functional element. For some reason not apparent Mr. ILomer does not mention Aristotle in this analysis of Greek thought, although at sev- eral points in his later discussion he uses Aristotelian conceptions and</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 413 harmonizes them with the modern ideas of the organic nature of ex- perience. With Bacon the emphasis falls on the method of knowledge. His significance from the point of view of an analysis of the method of ex- perience lies in the fact that he emphasized the method of experience as based upon an empirical knowledge of the phenomena of nature. Des- cartes is significant from the point of view of his emphasis on the method of personal experience. Starting with immediate experience, he seeks to arrive by the process of analysis of this experience at a true method for its organization, interpretation, and evaluation. With him knowledge and reality as aspects of experience can not be separated; they are integral parts of one organic whole. Reality becomes, then, primarily the reality of a process rather than one of fact. Comenius emphasized still further the organic nature of experience, especially in relation to the problem of education. " Comenius embodies in an ad- mirable way the first tentative efforts towards the functional conception of education as a phase of human experience." Kant concerned himself with a criticism of the process of experience itself with reference to determining its limitations and its positive func- tions. Mr. Lomer sums up the chief implications which his writings have for the problem of method as follows: " (1) His analysis of the character and the nature of human knowledge, though it is carried on rather from the structural point of view, does involve a consideration of the method of knowledge as an essential phase. Knowledge must be re- lated to virtuous action; theory and practise are interrelated phases of experience. (2) Kant emphasizes the fundamental creative power of the human mind. Method is a phase of an evolutionary experience. Education is genetic only if it is at the same time teleological. Self- activity is the fundamental method of education." The theory of evolution Mr. Lomer uses to give an organic interpre- tation to causation, theory of knowledge, and teleology. "Evolution is another term for 'universal' experience-it is causation in activity. . . .Causation is a principle, and it can therefore have no reality unless it is regarded as a function. . . . Causation is the method by which a universe of powers, potentialities, and promises realizes itself. Cau- sation is the potentiality, the dunamis, 'energizing,' actualizing itself, making reality. . . . The nature of the thing, its true end, is its de- velopment, its evolution, its self-realization in the highest form to which its potentiality is capable of reaching. . . . The who]e machinery of the universe is machinery only to the mechanically-minded man. To the evolutionist it is a vast, an infinitely vast, growing, living organism." Applying to epistemology the same line of thought as has been applied to causation makes necessary such a readjustment of the point of view of the relation of subject and object that this relation becomes organic as well as logical. Knowledge receives a functional interpretation in which its dominant aspect is that of an activity. When we get away from the narrow anthropomorphic interpretation of teleology, teleology is made manifest in the cosmic process. Evolution may be considered</page><page sequence="4">414 THE JO URNAL OF PHILOSOPHY as the rational process of cosmical organization and teleology as the science which shows all facts in their necessary causal relations to one another, in organic and functional terms, as parts of a rational scheme of development. Dr. Lomer uses the historical study and the discussion of the theory of evolution to lead up to his own interpretation of experience. In the light of the previous discussions it becomes evident that the analysis of experience into hard-and-fast and sharply separated kinds is not justified. Distinctions inevitably arise in the process of experience, because ex- perience is a moving active affair in which oppositions, conflicts, prob- lems arise in the interaction of self and environment; but such distinc- tions are functional and relative to the particular kind of situation with which we have to deal. From the genetic point of view there are three such inevitable distinctions in the complete development of experience. They are self-unconsciousness, self-consciousness, and self-realization. These, I take it, represent different stages in the process of adjustment between the self and its environment. They are modes of experience, not different kinds of experience, and as such are organically related to one another and to the whole process of activity as functionally deter- mining the reorganization of experience. This same line of thought is applied to the category of existence as it functions in experience. There are three levels of existence, organically related to one another, those of mere existence, of potentiality, and of activity. This does not mean, however, that there are three different kinds of existence which enter into our experience, but that there is an ascending scale of values in experience of which we become conscious. The consciousness of values implicitly involves the emergence of standards. The standard is not something external, however, but it also is functionally determined. Various classes of standards are to be distinguished in terms of the functions to be performed in the process of experience as we are con- fronted with problems as to (1) what we do, (2) why we do it, (3) how we do it. The significance for education of this discussion of distinc- tions within experience as functionally determined seems to be that the educational process is not to be conceived of as a mechanical matter of static elements, whether materials of the curriculum or " faculties " and " powers" of the mind, but rather that we must find the principle of activity and the processes of personality which give dynamic character to the situations in which materials of the curriculum and mental powers will have a functional value. This will have its bearing also on our conception of ends. From this point of view ends are not merely ends; they, too, have a functional significance which gives them prag- matic vitality. Even the mechanical and the teleological interpreta- tions of nature can be harmonized on the basis of this conception of the nature of ends. They merely represent specialized points of view of the same set of facts, the first the point of view of the facts and their rela- tions, the second that of the idea, or form, of which they are the progres- sive realization. In his discussion of the function of method, Mr. Lomer attempts to</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 415 "show that theory and practise are not two separate entities brought into relation in the course of experience . . . but differentiated as- pects in every phase of individual and social activity . . . complemen- tary phases of the function of intelligence in experience." Education can not safely either ignore conscious theory or make theory something external to and imposed upon practise. " Our experience is an organic part of our personality, and our theory and our practise are organic parts of our experience." In like manner education must seek the unity of the genetic and the teleological interpretations of the child and of the teaching process by taking the functional point of view. The two things, the developing child and the ideal of education, must be realized in their organic relation. "It is through this process of interaction that social purposes gain reality, and it is through the same process that the im- mature potentialities of the children gain ideal value." But inasmuch as the nature of experience furnishes the conditions under which stand- ards, as we have seen, differentiate to perform a function, so also is it a function of method to control experience in harmony with these stand- ards. Control is thus from the functional point of view not an arbi- trary, external thing, but is only another expression of the harmoniza- tion of the mechanical with the teleological whereby the end is realized through a series of steps marked by order or method. The whole discus- sion is brought at its conclusion into relation with the two great funda- mental ideas of evolution and idealism. IRVING ELGAR MILLER. GREELEY, COLORADO.</page></plain_text>
