<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW While I can imagine a variety of potential audiences for this thought-provoking book, it might be especially useful for sparking debate amongst students taking courses in ancient religion or gender studies. University of Leeds EMMA J. STAFFORD V. KARAGEORGHIS: Greek Gods and Heroes in Ancient Cyprus. Pp. 334, map, 237 ills. Athens: Commercial Bank of Greece, 1998. Cased. ISBN: 960-7059-08-5. This is an exquisitely produced volume destined, with its large print, lavish photos, and glossy paper, for the intellectual coffee table. Commissioned by the Commercial Bank of Greece, the book sets out to provide a broad survey of Greek gods and heroes in ancient Cyprus for the general public, with an emphasis on the more accessible 'visual aspects of the evidence' (p. 10). K. is, of course, eminently qualified for such a task, with nearly forty years of published work on Cypriot archaeology, and he manages to convey a fair amount of scholarship despite the popular format, with frequent references to ancient literature and suggestions for further reading; a catalogue provides full details of the 237 illustrations. The book is arranged chronologically, beginning (pp. 15-35) with the earliest possible evidence for the 'immigration' of Greek mythology to Cyprus on imported Mycenaean pottery, followed by the first statues of anthropomorphic deities, which coincide with the arrival of Achaean settlers in the twelfth century B.C. The tenth to seventh centuries see the 'acclimatization' of many Greek gods and heroes in Cypriot art (pp. 37-63), under the combined influences of Greek epic poetry and Phoenician trade; representations of Herakles especially demonstrate the mingling of Greek, Egyptian, and Near Eastern stylistic traits in a developing Cypriot iconography. A central chapter covers the sixth to fourth centuries (pp. 65-159), a period K. characterizes as one of 'a revival of Greek consciousness' (p. 66) in the face of Persian domination, but also of some cultural assimilation with Phoenicia. Representations of Herakles again provide a case study, with an identifiable Cypriot type compared to a more strongly Greek-influenced variety; other familiar Greek gods and heroes appear in a wide variety of media, some pieces being associated with specific cult places, e.g. of Athena, identified with the Phoenician Anat, at Idalion. Also included in this chapter is a survey of Greek gods and heroes on Cypriot coinage down to the Roman period, with some very fine examples, especially from the Bank of Cyprus collection in Nicosia. The second half of the book (pp. 161-293) covers the Hellenistic and Roman periods, when Cypriot art was subject to the same cosmopolitan influences as the rest of the Mediterranean world. In addition to major deities (Athena, Artemis, Apollo, Aphrodite, Zeus, Hermes, Dionysos, Asklepios, Herakles), many minor deities are represented, including several personifications. A final section surveys Greek gods and heroes on mosaic floors, featuring some beautiful examples, especially from Nea Paphos. For the most part K. resists the temptation to make political capital out of the theme of the 'Greekness' of ancient Cypriot religion, though the wealth of material presented does go some way towards excusing his concluding flourish that the island experienced a 'final triumph of hellenization' (p. 297). University of Leeds EMMA J. STAFFORD J. A. KOUMOULIDES (ed.): Greece: The Legacy. Essays on the History of Greece, Ancient, Byzantine and Modern. Pp. x + 127. Bethesda: University Press of Maryland, 1998. Cased, $30. ISBN: 1-883053-43-9. The Heritage of Greece: Ancient, Byzantine and Modern, the theme of a 1996-7 lecture series at Ball State University, is that which binds this very diverse collection of papers together. Of the ten contributors, only three, J. Griffin, M. Lefkowitz, and M. Mazower, actually presented their papers during the 1996-7 lecture series. The remaining contributions, delivered in previous years at Ball State, have been included because of their relevance to the theme. The editor, John A. Koumoulides, has divided the collection into four main sections: Ancient Greece, The Byzantine World, Greece in Transition, and Greece: The Modern Era. There is a short preface and the book is equipped with an index-one which, in evidence of the broad scope of this ? Classical Association, 2002 182</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW collection, can boast both Vietnam and Virgil amongst its contents. More care could have been taken with the Greek text, where rough breathings often replace acute accents. The first section comprises three papers, the first two being largely concerned with the refutation of the now infamous assertions of Martin Bernal that ancient Greece owes its greatest achievements to borrowings from the continent of Africa. J. Griffin discusses the uniqueness which ancient Greek political organization, historical thought, visual art, and scientific method display, while M. Lefkowitz, attacking Bernal more directly, defends the individuality of the Greek concept of 'philosophy'. One might prefer to turn to her book, Not Out of Africa. How Afrocentrism Became an Excuse to Teach Myth as History (New York, 1997), for a much fuller discussion of Bernal's controversial arguments. A paper by Sir Ronald Syme ends the first section with a scholarly discussion of the role which Greeks played in Roman government. The excellent contributions of J. Gill and D. M. Nicol constitute the second section. The former considers the identification of the Byzantine Empire as a continuation of the Roman Empire and the strong link which existed between church and empire, while the latter looks at how Greece has emerged today from the two very separate Byzantine and Hellenic traditions. The paper of B. M. Knox, which holds the single position of the third section, is mostly anecdotal, recounting his own experiences with modem Greece and the negative attitude which classicists have often displayed toward modem Greek. While his experiences with dimotiki and katharevousa are very interesting, his paper will perhaps not be of particular interest to scholars. The four remaining papers, by Sir David Hunt, Sir Edward Peck, M. Mazower, and J. A. Koumoulides, compose the fourth section, looking at Greece in the modern era. The first examines the role of Greece in the Second World War and the northern defence against the Italians, the second the role of the United Nations in Greece immediately following the war, and the third the history of the Jews in Greece during the holocaust, while Koumoulides closes the book by considering Greek emigration to America and the character of the contemporary Greek-American community. In the preface, Koumoulides reveals his intended audience as 'students of Greece, both professional and amateur' (p. ix). This is really a book for the philhellene and for those looking for a general taste of Greek history; given its wide historical coverage, few will want to read this book in its entirety for the purpose of scholarship. Individual papers will, however, undoubtedly be of interest. Merton College, Oxford ANDREW T. FAULKNER K. J. HOLKESKAMP, E. STEIN-HOLKESKAMP (edd.): Von Romulus zu Augustus. Grosse Gestalten der r6mischen Republik. Pp. 394. Munich: Verlag C. H. Beck, 2000. Cased, DM 58.90. ISBN: 3-406- 46697-4. Like the companion volume on the Greek world edited by Kai Brodersen (1999; reviewed in CR 50 [2000], 380-1), this work offers a series of biographical essays covering 'well known and today no longer so well known, famous and infamous, but in any case influential personalities in Roman history' (p. 5). The essays are clearly written and entirely successful in their apparent aim of being accessible to an educated but non-specialist audience. Their readability is perhaps enhanced by the fact that the various authors spend little time discussing problems of evidence or providing detailed references to the sources, preferring to maintain the impetus of their narratives. Ineevitably, however, this means that the collection has little to offer researchers in the field, while university teachers may prefer to point their students in the direction of books which will give them a better idea of how historians go about reconstructing the past from its surviving fragments. Criticisms of the 'biographical' approach to writing history are legion. These essays neatly avoid one objection, that the life of an individual rarely coincides with or illuminates a significant historical period, by offering a series of lives which do indeed span the history of the Republic (even if, inevitably, they cluster in the late second and first centuries) and by focusing (of necessity) on the public careers of these figures rather than the minutiae of private life and personality that tend to interest more conventional biographers. The collection also seeks to avoid the accusation that biographical history overplays the r6le of the individual in shaping events, by constantly emphasizing the structures of politics, society, cultures, and ideology that shaped the ?
