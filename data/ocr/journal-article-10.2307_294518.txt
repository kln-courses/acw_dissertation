<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMBER, AVALLON, AND APOLLO'S SINGING SWAN This paper explores the northern elements in the Greek Apollo. It does not argue for a "northern" rather than an "eastern" or Anatolian deity but takes for granted that Apollo is an intricate fabric of "north- ern" and "eastern" elements. In treating the vertical threads we pre- suppose, rather than deny, the horizontal. Our chief concerns are those traditions linking Apollo with the North: the singing swans that draw his chariot and the amber legend with which his name is often associated. I. Socrates, Orpheus, and the singing swan Towards the end of Plato's myth of Er, famous souls, ready to be reincarnated, choose different forms for their new existence: i65Ev pev yap iuxfrv ?E0 TflV nTOTE Opc0ES yEVOpEVnv KUKVOU (3iov aipoupEvrjv, picoe TOO yuvalKeiou yEvouq 61a TOV Un' TKE1iVWV OdvaTov OUK ?eEXouoav Ev yuvaliKi yEVVOeeoav yevoOal.. . 16.

(Republic 620A) Er said he saw the soul that had once been Orpheus choosing a swan's life, because of her hatred for womankind. Since she had died at their hands, she did not wish to come into being again by being born in a woman.... He also saw a swan switching around to choose a human life, and other "musical" creatures likewise. To avoid woman, Orpheus' soul chooses rebirth as the grammatically masculine swan; yet his soul is grammatically feminine. Alliteration underscores the paradox. It plays on gyne (woman), genesthai (become), gennasthai (be born), and kyknos (swan), recalling Cratylus 414A, where Socrates connects, etymologically, gyne (woman) and gone (birth). The swan awaiting rebirth chooses to be human. Thus Orpheus' soul and the swan-not the swan's soul, we note-seem to be alternating forms of one another. Swans are proverbially beautiful singers, and able to predict their own deaths (Oppian, Cynegetica 2.540-50).

AHL one's death with a song of exceptional beauty. So the choice made by Orpheus' soul is appropriate. Old, prophetic bards are often compared to swans in Classical poetry: KUKVOqg Wq y?EpWV 6do66i (Eur. Heracles 691-94). Vergil employs this idea in Aeneid 10.191-92 where he de- scribes the metamorphosis of the Ligurian prince Cygnus (i.e. Swan) into a swan: dum canit et maestum Musa solatur amorem canentem molli pluma duxisse senectam. While lightly singing and solacing his sad love with song, he whitely aged with soft feathers. The vowel in cano, when extended, brings the singer to old age and whiteness. He becomes, like Horace in Odes 2.20, a swan. Plato attributes this prophetic, swanlike quality to Socrates' old age. He transfers Apollo's swan from poetry to philosophy, a move Plutarch felt needed justification hundreds of years later.1 In The E at Delphi 387C-D, Plutarch's Theon observes: "Apollo takes pleasure in the singing of swans and in the strumming of lyres. Why be surprised that he embraces and loves that part of discourse he sees philosophers using best and most often, since he is genuinely fond of dialectic?" In a famous passage ( Phaedo 84D-85B), Socrates hopes his own prophecy will match that of swans "who, though they also sing in earlier times, sing especially well when on the point of death, because they are about to go off to the god whose servant they are." They do not sing from grief: "Since they are Apollo's birds, they are prophetic. They know beforehand that what is in Hades' (or, to use the etymology of the Cratylus, "the Unseen") realm is good-and they take delight in a different way that day than they have ever delighted before." Socrates' mission, Plato says, began with Apollo's oracle at Delphi (Apology 20E-21E). It ended, Plato points out, when the sacred ship returned from Apollo's Delian festival and Socrates was executed (Phaedo 58A-B; Crito 43C-D). Socrates' career is bounded by Apollo's major shrines; and his death is linked with the island of Apollo's birth. 1 For the swan as Apollo's bird, see D'Arcy Thompson, A Glossary of Greek Birds (London and Oxford 1936) 184.

(Hymn 4.249-55) The swans, the god's prophetic singers, left Maeonian Pactolus, singing as they flew, and circled Delos seven times. These Muses' birds, most poetical and most prophetic of all winged creatures, sang at the delivery bed like bards. Because of this, the child later bound seven strings to his lyre, matching the number of times the birds sang over the pains of his birth. The swans, whose finest song is usually reserved for their own deaths, hail the birth of their god. They are his poetic soul. Ancient authors disagree as to what this finest swansong sounded like. Pliny (NH 10.32) denies swans sing at all. Philostratus (Imagines 1.9) describes the song as caused by the west wind (Zephyrus) blowing through the bird's feathers. Modern observers fare a little better. E. A. Armstrong talks of the trumpeting of the whooper swan and the "wing-music" of the mute swan.2 J. Fisher suggests that the whoopers-if you are bored -"sound like donkeys braying for their mothers"; but then again, "they may bring you from your sleeping tent as trumpeters of morning with their ... magic music of bells."3 D'Arcy Thompson comments: "The concrete or literal interpretation is quite inadequate; it is beyond a doubt that the swan's song (like the Hal- cyon's) veiled, and still hides some mystical allusion."4 H. W. Robinson, however, gives an important clue with this description of a dying swan's song: Wings fixed, he commenced at once his song which was continued until the water was reached nearly a mile away. Never before or since have I heard anything like the song of this stricken swan. It sounded at times like the running notes of an octave, most plaintive in character and 2E. A.

AHL musical in tone and, as the sound was borne to us, mellowed by the distance, we stood astounded and could only exclaim, "We have heard the song of a dying swan."5 The seven discrete notes of the octave-the eighth is a repetition, an octave higher, of the first-correspond to the swan circles over Delos honoring Apollo's birth, inspiring him to give the lyre extra strings.6 Apollo is the octave's divine discoverer as Pythagoras was its human discoverer. Hence Apollo's special magic to poets, and to Plato and Pythagoras, so concerned with music, number, and cosmic harmony. Apollo, the swan's god, is the center of their revolutions, just as his Delphic shrine is the omphalos, the egg-shaped navel and center of the universe.7 We may also think of the harmony of the universe's seven outer spheres rotating about the center in Republic 10.616B-D-in the very myth of Er where Orpheus' soul chooses to be a swan. The number seven, like the swan, is Apollo's. His festivals all fall on the seventh of the month.8 At Delphi his birth was celebrated on the 7th Busios; at Athens and Delos on the 7th Thargelion; at Cyrene on the 7th Carneios.9 Similar traditions cluster around Socrates and Plato, reputed to have been born on the same days as Artemis and Apollo respectively: the 6th and 7th Thargelion.10 Further, Socrates is said to have dreamed, the night before Plato became his student, that a swan flew into his breast; this dream may have been commemorated in a monument near the Academy (Pausanias 1.30.3)." Plato never claimed he actually was Apollo, as Lucian says Pythagoras maintained he was Apollo reincar- nate.'2 But Apollonian symbolism, and Pythagoreans-much given to 5 Thompson (note 1, above) 183. 6 Callimachus, Hymn 4.249-55. 7 See H.

The very drug so destructive to swans destroyed Socrates. Hemlock is fatal to swans-KUKVWV 6? KOWVEIOV 6Xe?po--Aelian observes (On the Characteristics of Animals 3.7). To Plato, Apollo and his swans symbolize the injunction to self- knowledge, and the cyclical nature of being, no longer bounded by birth or by woman who gives birth, by the genetic forces defining the beginning and end of biological life. Callimachus makes a similar suggestion by poetic alliteration of kyknoi (swans) and ekyklosanto (circled) in the passage cited above, as does Euripides in IT 1103-1105. Singing swans mark the circling year with their migrations. When the Greek spring came, the swans would vanish towards the north, and not return until autumn, when everything else was starting to die. Their life-cycle was strangely reversed. II. Swans and Hyperboreans Lucian describes a fruitless search along the Po in Northern Italy for the fabled singing swan. When he asks his boatmen where the swans are, they say they have seen a few occasionally in the shallows, but that they make a feeble and musically uninspired croaking ( Amber of the Swans 5). The mute swan the boatmen describe is "rare as a breeding bird" in Italy; it was probably no more common in antiquity either in Italy or in mainland Greece, especially the Peloponnese.14 The singing swan or whooper would have been less common still. It breeds slightly below the Arctic circle; it might winter in north Italy-around the Po, as myth suggested-or in north Greece, but not breed there.15 13 J. Burnet, Early Greek Philosophy (London and Edinburgh 1892), for the myth of Er as Pythagorean and Apollo Hyperboreus as the chief Pythagorean god (97, note 3; 216-17); cf. his Plato's Phaedo (Oxford 1911) notes, pp. 1 and 9 and R.

Swans were probably as rare in Egypt as in Egyptian hieroglyphs. Early Egyptologists interpreted the determinative for htm (perish) and shtm (destroy) as "swan"; but J. Weinstein points out to me that the determinative is a white-fronted goose (cf. A.H. Gardiner Egyptian Grammar3 (Oxford 1957) Sign List G38, 471 and 583. Taking goose hieroglyphs as swans might appeal to Pythagoreans: for "perish" and "destroy" are popular Greek etymologies for Apollo. 15 Ogilvie (note 14, above) 43-44, reports nests as far south as 61?

Hence, perhaps, the rivalry between Apollo and Zephyrus as lovers of Hyacinthus-a rivalry which gives Hyacinth the chance to ride in Apollo's swan chariot, but causes his death.16 The west wind cannot bring fruitfulness to Hyacinth. Apollo, in whose chariot he rides, would be carrying him away from the Greek springtime to the Hyperborean lands beyond the north wind.17 The Hyperboreans are a holy people in an earthly paradise, who experience no disease, no fighting, no old age (Pindar, Pythian 10.31-34). They live peacefully and close to the sea, Herodotus says, summarizing what would be, if extant, the oldest reference to them: the Arimaspea of Aristeas of Proconnesus (4.13).18 You cannot reach the Hyperboreans either by land or sea, says Pindar (Pythian 10.29); and most stories of travel to and fro involve flight. Further, there is something otherworldly as well as northerly about their land.19 They live "in the farthest regions just below the temple of Apollo," the scholiast on Pindar, Olympian 3.18 declares, citing Pherenicus.20 Antonius Liberalis and Iamblichus mention such a northern temple; Philostratus describes it (Life of Apollonius of Tyana 6.10-11).21 Diodorus says the temple is on an island no smaller than Sicily, round, and in the far north; Apollo was specially fond of it 16 Ibid. 47-49.

(Strabo 7.3.1) Over the entire ocean, to the world's limits, to night's springs, to heaven's counterfolds and Phoebus' ancient garden. The fullest account is Aelian's (On the Characteristics of Animals 11.1), derived, he says, from Hecataeus of Abdera: When the sons of Boreas and Chione (i.e. North Wind and Snow) ... have performed the holy rites, there swoop down from the so-called Rhipaean mountains swans in huge clouds. After they have gone around the temple, as if purifying it by their flight, they land in the temple precinct which is very large and very beautiful. And whenever the bards sing in their own inspired way to the god, and the harpists accompany the chorus with a harmonious melody, the swans join together in the music, and never sing a single note out of tune or discordant. But they take their cue as if from a conductor and sing along with those of the native inhabitants who are learned in the sacred melodies. Then, when the hymn and the customary honor to the god has been completed, this-if you'll pardon the expression-winged choir I have mentioned, having sung and intoned his praises, departs. Certain elements in Aelian may be based on Delian ritual; some may survive in popular Christian notions of paradise. Others resemble north European myth. The Hyperboreans themselves supposedly came to Delos with offerings, travelling from their homeland to Scythia, thence to the Adriatic, before entering Greece (Herodotus 4.32-35). Two girls, Hyper- oche and Laodice, were their ambassadors, escorted by five men known as perphorees during their first visit: seven in all. Two other Hyperbo- rean girls-sometimes Arge and Opis, though their names vary-came to Delos at the same time as Apollo and Artemis. They were honored in a hymn composed by Olen of Lycia, author of other ancient hymns sung by women at Delos.22 The two Hyperborean maidens could be 22Cf. W. K. C.

For the names given them by Callimachus, Loxo and Hecaerge, recall Apollo's own names Loxias and Hecaergos (Hymn 4.305).23 The link between the Hyperboreans and the cults of Apollo is well attested in antiquity. Nowhere is this clearer than in the tradition that Apollo himself travelled to and from the land of the Hyperboreans in a swan chariot: KUKVOI T' ijcav TO aippa (Alcaeus, fr. 1-4 Bergk).24 He drives, Nonnus observes, not a swift horse, but a winged swan: KUKVOV dyW.v nTepoevTa, Kai oU TaXC(V 'nrov (Dionysiaca 38.202). III. The Phoinix and the swan Apollo is called Letoides after his mother Leto, although the naming of a son after his mother by matronymic is not common Greek practice.25 Herodotus suggests it is uniquely Lycian.26 If Wilamowitz is right, the name Leto is a variant of the Lycian word for woman: lada.27 Apollo is then linked with a Lycian, or a more generally Anatolian female divinity whom tradition, at some point, took to be his mother. Very little in the Apollo myths is clear. Even Delos, his birthplace, shifts shape and identity, beginning as a kind of divine meteorite orig- inally called Asteria who "like a star, leaped from heaven, fleeing mar- riage with Zeus" (Callimachus, Hymn 4.36-38). Some sources suggest Asteria was Leto's sister who fled heaven, like Astraea in Ovid, Meta- morphoses 1.149-50; she was first turned into a stone, then Ortygia (i.e. Quail Island), then Delos.28 Even as an island, she wandered before 23 Pausanias 9.27.2; Diodorus 2.47.7; [Plato] Axiochus 371A; Servius on Aen. 11.532.

Leto and her sister Asteria, subse- quently Delos, seem like variants of one tradition. Leto's usual symbol is the phoinix: the palm tree which gave her support and rest during her labor.29 Now although palms, Pliny notes, grow in Europe, they are sterile there: the palm bears fruit only in a hot climate.30 Leto's phoinix is at its northern limits in Delos much as Apollo's swan is at its southern limits. If the swan and phoinix were solar symbols, as we shall see they probably were, this odd feature might help explain why Delos was home to a cult of the solstices.3' The phoinix, in Pythagorean symbolic interpretations of Egyptian hieroglyphics, represents the year. "It is the only tree producing a branch at each rising of the moon; it completes the year in twelve branches.... To represent a month, the Egyptians show either a palm tree or a moon inverted" (Horapollo 1.3; 1.4). So Leto is linked with the phoinix, symbolic of the moon and the lunar calendar. But the phoinix is not the only hieroglyphic symbol for the year. The primary symbol is "Isis, that is to say 'woman': 'Iov, TOUTECoTI yUvalKa" (1.3).32 If Leto's name itself means "woman," her phoinix and "woman" would be interchangeable anyway. Of the palms Pliny mentions one variety is able to die and be reborn from itself: intermori ac renasci ex seipsa-an ability shared with the phoinix bird "who, it is thought, takes its name from this palm" (NH 13.42). In Egyptian, as in Greek, phoinix designates both the mythical sun bird, the phoenix, and the palm tree; as bird, it is a waterfowl, itself reputedly born beneath a tree.33 The phoinix bird 29Callimachus Hymn 2.4-5; 4.210; Hom.

AHL comes to bury its father at the temple of the Sun in Heliopolis (Herodo- tus 2.73). Horapollo observes: When they want to denote a soul (4uXjv) spending a lot of time there, they depict the phoinix bird because it lives longest of all creatures in the world; it denotes a great flood, because it is a symbol of the sun--r?iou iOTIV 6 toivil oiup5aoXov-which is greater than anything else in the universe. (Horapollo 1.34) The phoinix bird is usually male. But the tree, though usually female, may be either masculine or feminine. The male tree flowers, the female produces its fruit without flowering (Theophrastus, Enquiry into Plants 1.13.4). In phoinix, then, we find a tree symbolizing the female, birth, the twelve-month year, and the moon. We also find a waterbird symbolizing the male, centuries, the sun, and the soul. Most of these elements are present in the cults of the twin gods Apollo and Artemis. Indeed the bisexual phoinix may correspond to the Phoibos and Phoibe names linked to Apollo and Artemis, the sun and the moon. Phoibe, in fact, is the name of Leto's mother in some versions of the myth.34 Through Leto and the phoinix, Apollo is linked to woman, to Egyptian and near-eastern lunar and solar symbolism, and to notions of time. This lore is interwoven with the Hyperborean Apollo and his swan. For the swan, like the phoinix, is important to the calendar. The phoinix bird marks the movements of centuries; the swan the shorter cycles of individual human life-it migrates annually.35 As the phoinix tree marks the months by the growth of its branches, the swan gives the divisions of seven dividing the month. The phoinix, Philostratus says, is the size and appearance of an eagle; and it shares with the swan the ability to sing its own death song (Life of Apollonius of Tyana 3.49). 34 See Apollodorus 1.2.2; Hesiod, Theogony 136, 404, 409 with M. L. West ad loc. in Hesiod Theogony (Oxford 1976); cf. Pliny NH 4.66. 35 The phoinix also signifies in hieroglyphs a man returning from a prolonged residence abroad (Horapollo 1.35). In A.D. 34 the phoinix itself was reported to have returned: Tacitus, Annals 6.28. Plutarch (Isis and Osiris 354 E-F, and 363 F) compares Pythagorean symbolism with Egyptian hieroglyphs. J. Gwyn Griffiths, Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride (Cambridge 1970) 287, denies hieroglyphs are used symbolically. But see Porphyry, Life of Pythagoras 8; Clement Alex. Stromata 5.555; Horapollo 2.39 has a metaphorical swan hieroglyph. 382</page><page sequence="11">AMBER, AVALLON, AND APOLLO'S SINGING SWAN In Delos we find the phoinix tree, but not the phoinix bird.

Did the phoinix tree displace a northern fruit-bearing tree, and did the swan displace the phoinix bird to yield the curious blend of northern and middle-eastern elements in Apollo? Is the swan, like the phoinix, a solar waterbird-making its middle eastern counterpart superfluous in Delos, island of the solstice cult? IV. Leda and the swan The most famous Greek female associated with swans is Leda, the Spartan princess often identified as mother of Castor and Pollux, and of Helen and Clytemnestra. Leda's name has been traced to the same word for "woman" we find in Leto.36 The familiar story tells how Zeus, disguised as a swan, raped Leda. But there are other versions. An old legend has Helen as child of Nemesis; the egg she is hatched from is brought by Hermes to Leda who acts as a surrogate brooding-hen.37 In Attic pottery of the fourth century B.C., representations of Helen's birth usually show an egg on an altar; on either side of the altar are Castor and Pollux, Leda, and sometimes, Tyndareus. When a bird is shown, it is an eagle, not a swan.38 Euripides' Helen sheds further light. Helen introduces herself as child of Tyndareus, then comments: 36 A. H. Krappe, "AFIOAAQN KYKNO!," CP 37 (1942) 353-70, especially p. 363: "Leda, Dor. Lada cannot be separated from Leto, Dor. Lato (whence Latin Latonia). The word is generally thought to be the equivalent of Gr. yuvi, "woman," and the goddess would then be woman par excellence." Cf. Wilamowitz (note 22, above). Krappe's article has been well but cautiously received: see Guthrie (note 23, above) 82 and Dodds (note 21, above) 161-62, note 36. 37 See H. Metzger (note 24, above) 277-86; cf. J. D.

(Helen 17-22) This odd story-Helen calls it a logos-introduces a motif of two birds who battle each other throughout Greek and Latin literature, beginning in Iliad 15.692: the swan and the eagle. In Aeneid 1.393-400, Venus describes an attack on a flight of twelve swans by a single eagle, de- scribed as Jupiter's bird, Iovis ales. The swans survive, as swans usually do in these fights, for reasons given by Aristotle in Historia Animalium 9.615B and elaborated by D' Arcy Thompson: The mythology of the swan is inseparable from the phenomena attending the constellation Cygnus. The stellar swan lies in the Milky Way, "the river of Heaven," near to the constellation Lyra ... it rose a little in advance of the Eagle, but, lying more to the north, it only set some time after the Eagle had gone down, that is to say it was attacked by the Eagle but in turn defeated it ... at its own rising the Virgin (Leda) was in mid-heaven, and the twins Castor and Pollux were just setting in the west.39 Adding to the astronomical complexity is the fact that the eagle is a solar bird associated with Zeus.40 Thompson suggests that Leda was originally herself a swan attacked by an eagle; and A. H. Krappe identifies Leda, as Wilamowitz does Leto, with "woman."41 Thus the bird attacking Leda would more logically be an eagle than a swan. What happened mythically may be as follows: since tradition eventually made the swan male, the swan and Leda had to be distinguished. The eagle became superfluous; its presence in pottery and in the Helen is the survival of an older tradition which had yet to rationalize all the separate elements. Perhaps the story originally told how the eagle caught the swan, as in Statius' Thebaid 9.858-62, during its moment of rest on the water; BCH 66-67 (1942-43) 1-21; R. Kekule von Stradonitz, Die Geburt der Helena aus dem Ei (Berlin 1908). Helen is often shown as the child of Nemesis; cf. Apollodorus 3.10.7. 39Thompson (note 1, above) 184; also 7, 12, 183-85 for conflicts between eagles and swans. Exceptions to the "victorious swan" are the similes of Turnus killing Lycus (Aen. 9.563-66) and Dryas killing Parthenopaeus (Thebaid 9.858-62). 40 Thompson (note 1, above) 3-4 for the eagle as Zeus' bird and as a solar emblem; p. 184 for the swan and Apollo. Swan and eagle combine in Pythagoras' white eagle (Iamblichus, Life of Pythagoras 132; Aelian, VH 4.17; Pausanias 8.17.3 (with Thompson, p.178.) 41 Note 36, above. 384</page><page sequence="13">AMBER, AVALLON, AND APOLLO'S SINGING SWAN swan-maidens, E. A. Armstrong observes, can be caught only when they are on water, when they have removed their wings: at the moulting season.42 They can be kept only until they find their wings and fly away. The Leda myth involves much "twinning." Two different birds are associated with her, one, I suspect, originally male (the eagle), the other originally female (the swan). There are two sets of twins: one male (Castor and Pollux), one female (Clytemnestra and Helen).43 The only combination missing is twins of which one is male and the other female. But if we concede Wilamowitz's and Krappe's arguments that Leto and Leda derive from words meaning "woman," Leto and Leda are themselves doubles.44 Therefore Apollo and Artemis complete the series; they are twins of which one is male, the other female. The individuals within the resulting "pairs" differ in interesting ways. Clytemnestra and Helen are two "swan" maidens who marry two "eagle" men: Agamemnon and Menelaus, Aeschylus' "eagle-brood."45 Clytemnestra stays home, but kills her husband when he returns with yet another swan-like, prophetic woman, Cassandra.46 Helen leaves her husband-as migrating swan-maidens tend to-but is recaptured. This treachery of swan-maidens explains another feature of the myth of Er, where Agamemnon's soul chooses rebirth as an eagle: TTIV 6' Eni TOUTp 'AyaopEpovvoq' kXOP&amp; 6K Kal TauTrIV TOO dvepwrrivou yeVOuq 616 T6 nadooS 6eTOo 6siaXXC6al f3iov.

Armstrong (note 2, above) 50: "underlying the twin legends is the belief in double paternity ... when a god intervenes, twins result.... The intervening divinity is often thought of as appearing in animal form." The paternity of Castor and Pollux is also disputed: W. H.

AHL eagle. Orpheus, who was also destroyed by as well as born of woman, rejects woman. Agamemnon, more soured by swan-maidens, rejects humanity totally. On the one side we have the swan, the prophetic poet, and Apollo; on the other the eagle, the warrior, and Zeus. The prophet, like the waterbird that is his (or her) symbol, oscillates between sexes.47 For in Greek literature, whiteness symbolizes the feminine (as it does in pottery), as well as swans, and northerly people, much as a tan color symbolizes the masculine, eagles, and other people. The swan symbolizes not only Orpheus, but Cassandra. There are even prophets who, like Teiresias, change sex. Of the remaining pairs, Apollo and Artemis are of opposite sexes and eventually become identified with the Sun and Moon respectively. Castor and Pollux are brothers, one immortal, one mortal, alternating between light and darkness. If the eagle and swan were not just rivals, but rival symbols of light, a common linking motif would emerge among all the pairs: that of the light and the banished light. V. The swan priest Of the seven mythic heroes named Cygnus (i.e. "Swan"), the best known is Ares' son who built a temple of skulls to Apollo at Pagasae. This Cygnus is killed by Heracles in the Hesiodic Shield of Heracles.48 In another version, derived from the Cyclic poets and alluded to in the AB scholia to Iliad 23.346, Heracles and his horse Arion defeat Cygnus in a chariot race at Pagasae. Both versions connect Cygnus with Pagasae and with Apollo. Farnell argues that, despite Apollo's wrath with him in the Shield, Cygnus was originally "the friend or priest" of Apollo, whose name suggests "the Hyperborean priest of Apollo."49 The Hyperborean connection is secure enough. Cygnus' battle with Heracles is introduced by a description of Heracles' shield, on whose rim Ocean is represented, teeming with noisy swans (315-17). 47 See M. Gimbutas, The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe 7000-3500 B.C. (London 1974) 112-50, especially 132-36 (the bisexuality of the water-bird deity). 48Shield 57-140; 318-480; cf. Stesichorus fr. 12 (Bergk) cited by the scholiast on Pindar, Olympian 10.15 and 17. 49 Op. cit. (note 17, above) 4.273. See however J. Fontenrose (note 28, above) 68. Cygnus' unpleasantness suggests preference for Heracles in the tradition and a darker side to Apollo himself. For human sacrifice at Apollo's feasts, see Farnell 4.267, note 6 and 4.274-79. Parke and Wormell (note 7, above) 340-44 recognize the rivalry, even enmity, between Heracles and Apollo. Orpheus too was once Apollo's rival. 386</page><page sequence="15">AMBER, AVALLON, AND APOLLO'S SINGING SWAN The seven Cygnuses-like Socrates-are in stories which "always emphasize their death and their association with Apollo." Farnell con- cludes (p. 273): Therefore, though the lexicographers give us seven, we may believe in one 'swan,' a shadowy, sacerdotal figure of the north Greek or "Hyperbo- rean" Apolline worship, who dies in the service of his god, and whose legend is carried about, and becoming confused, begets many other 'swan,' who play strange, sometimes epic, parts, but whose actions and sufferings betray something of their original significance. Cygnus' fights pit priest against warrior, an antagonism as old as the Iliad, paralleling the antagonism of the priestly bird, the swan, to the warrior bird, the eagle. Apollo's bird fights Zeus'. So the enmity between Zeus' child Heracles, and Cygnus is predictable. The most complete Swan hero in Classical literature is the warrior priest Amphiaraus in the Thebaid. Like Orpheus, Amphiaraus is a prophetic singer destroyed by a woman-his wife, Eriphyle-who yearned to possess Harmonia's necklace and betrayed Amphiaraus to get it. Amphiaraus is Apollo's priest, buried alive when his chariot crashes into the underworld where, Sophocles' chorus suggests, he becomes "king of the dead" (Electra 837-39). He is the first of the Argive seven to die in the Theban war (Thebaid 7.795-823). The motto on his shield is the Apollonian "conquered Pytho" (4.221-22). His troops are from Apollo's town, Amyclae, and from Eurotas "home to swans-oloriferi Eurotae" (4.233; 227). His soldiers wear a Ledaeus apex, surely a crest of swan-feathers (4.236); he himself is a vision of snowy whiteness when he competes in the chariot race at the first Nemean games: ipse habitu niveus, nivei dant colla iugales, concolor est albis et cassis et infula cristis. (Thebaid 6.326-31) He himself wore clothing the color of snow, and snow-white was the team that put its neck into the yoke. His helmet and his priestly band match the whiteness of his plumes. His lead horse is named Cygnus: bred from Castor's famous horse Cyllarus while Castor was away with the Argonauts (6.528-30). Amphi- araus and Cygnus might have won full honors in the race, had Neptune not intervened to ensure that his horse Arion came in first-though 387</page><page sequence="16">FREDERICK M. AHL without its charioteer (6.499-530). The similarities with the Hesiodic race at Pagasae are surely obvious.50 Other elements show Amphiaraus is a swan priest of the Cygnus type: he takes the omens for the war of the Seven against Thebes from a flight of swans attacked by seven eagles (3.527-47). The swans, of course, survive the attack; the eagles, except for one, perish. Among the fallen eagles Amphiaraus sees himself. The swan-priest, compelled to become a warrior, dies as one of the eagles. The linking of swan and horse in the chariot race imagery in the Thebaid recalls Plato's description of the human soul as a chariot drawn by two horses, one good, one evil. (Phaedrus 244-47).51 The good horse is high-necked and white-suggesting a swan-the evil horse stout-necked and dark-suggesting an eagle, hawk, or raven. It is the Orpheus and the Agamemnon in each of us. Man's soul, being imperfect, cannot control its chariot, loses its divine feathers and falls to earth where it must dwell. The idea of the soul losing its wings and falling suggests the Icarus myth; but its fall, unlike Icarus', is a tem- porary loss of feathers-a birdlike moulting. It will fly again and return to the sky. The notion of humans having difficulty controlling their horses, however, suggests above all Phaethon. And Phaethon is certainly on Statius' mind in the chariot race. Heracles' erstwhile horse Arion which comes home first ahead of Cygnus, is not driven by its new owner, Adrastus, king of Argos. It is driven by Polynices, son of Oedipus, who 50 Arion was the child of Poseidon who turned himself into a stallion when Deme- ter eluded his attack by changing into a mare (Pausanias 8.25.4-7); first mentioned in Iliad 23.346-47; first owned by Oncus, next by Heracles, finally by Adrastus, Eriphyle's brother and Amphiaraus' brother-in-law (Pindar, Nemean 9.12-62). Amphiaraus is every- where associated with horses and chariots; his horse is named only in Statius' Thebaid. See also note 113, below. 51 Parmenides, fr. 1 (= Sextus Empiricus Adv. Math. 7.3 and Simplicius De Caelo 557.25) describes his progress to knowledge as a journey in a chariot with blazing axle; and he is escorted by the Heliades. More detailed than Plato's is Dio Chrysostom's Zoroastrian cosmic chariot (Discourse 36). This is not, as T. Gomperz claimed, Dio's invention (Griechische Denker, vol. 1 [Leipzig 1896] 65) but, as L. A. Campbell observes: "a Magian conception of the elemental powers of the cosmos, roughly contemporary with the Mithraic mysteries" (Mithraic Iconography and Ideology, Etudes Preliminaires aux Religions Orientales dans l'Empire Romain 11 [Leiden 1968] 157; also 159-62 and plates XXII and XXIII for correspondences with the Mithraic chariot of the Dieburg relief).

Statius pointedly compares Polynices' failure and fall with that of Phaethon (6.316-25). VI. The singer metamorphosed Of the seven swan heroes one is often connected with north Euro- pean peoples. Pausanias 10.30.3 tells us: The swan-the bird, that is-is famous as a musician because they say a musician named "Swan" became king of the Ligurians who live on the other side of the Eridanus, beyond the Celtic kingdoms; when he dies, by Apollo's decision, he was turned into the bird of that name, so they say. The identification of "Swan" as a Ligurian involves a word-play with the Greek Xiyuqg: "clear and melancholy."52 In the Palatine Anthology (2.72 [414]), Vergil is described as a "swan, clear-voiced and melancholy- Xiyu6poog KUKVOq," a beautiful multiple entendre. Vergil was from Gallic-speaking Mantua, close to the Po, reputed home of singing swans. And the melancholy of Vergil's poetry is inescapable. Further, in Aeneid 10.185-203, Mantua's contingent coming to Aeneas' aid is listed right after the Ligurian squadron, led by Cinyrus. Cinyrus is accompanied by Cupavo, son of Ligurian Cygnus who was transformed first into a swan, then into a constellation through grief at his friend Phaethon's death.53 The most familiar version of the Phaethon myth, Ovid's, also mentions Ligurians. Metamorphoses 1.747-2.380 tells how the Sun's son, Phaethon, is permitted to drive his father's chariot for a day. The result is a disastrous cosmic fire, ended when Jupiter destroys Phaethon with a thunderbolt. Phaethon's body, still burning, crashes 52 In Homer, Miyewq suggests lamentation: the sound is not only clear but melan- choly (Iliad 19.20; Odyssey 10.201; 11.391; 16.216; 21.56). E. Livrea, Apollonii Rhodii Argonauticon Liber IV, Biblioteca di Studi Superiori, vol. 60 (Florence 1973) on Argon. 4.605 adduces Oppian Cynegetica 3.103 which catches something of this flavor: pupovTal XiyEW? 661v6v y6ov. 53 For the variants of Cinyrus' name, see R.

Kivupopal, uncommon earlier, is popular with Alexandrians and their successors. A Ligurian prince whose name suggests lament in both his nation and his name (Xiyuq and KivupOq) might have appealed to Vergil. 389</page><page sequence="18">FREDERICK M. AHL into the river Eridanus; his sisters, the Heliades, weep until they become trees and their tears amber. Phaethon's friend Cygnus is metamorphosed into a swan.54 Why, we must ask, is Swan a friend of the Sun's child? VII. The solar chariot Anne Ross observes: The swan comes into full prominence as a cult bird in the Urnfield and Hallstatt phases of European prehistory. The evidence strongly suggests that this bird was especially associated with the solar cults which were widespread in Europe, and which can be traced from the Bronze Age, into the Iron Age, certain of the motifs eventually being incorporated into early Christian iconography.55 The swan was a cult bird in Northern Europe during the height of Celtic power from, roughly, the end of the Bronze Age to the fourth and third centuries B.C. when the Celts sacked Rome and wrought havoc in Greece and Asia Minor. There are remarkable rock engravings along the Scandinavian Baltic coast, and the west coast of Norway dating from the sixteenth century B.C. depicting, among other things, swans, horses, boats, and 54 In most versions Phaethon falls into the Eridanus; in Lucretius 5.397-405, he simply falls to earth. Aen. 10.185-203 has the Heliades changing into poplars (Ovid does not), but does not mention Apollo. Euripides' Hippolytus 732-51 refers to the Heliades' tears and the Eridanus; see W. S. Barrett, Euripides' Hippolytus (Oxford 1964) 299-306. The evidence is summarized by F. Bomer, P. Ovidius Naso Metamorphosen, Buch I-III (Heidelberg 1969) ad loc., and by J. Diggle, Euripides' Phaethon (Cambridge 1970) 4-32 and 180ff; A. H. Krappe, "Phaethon," Review of Religion 8 (1944) 115-29; Livrea (note 52, above) 159-282; J. G.

In a brilliant paper, Ernst Sprockhoff showed how this imagery developed into the concept of a solar chariot, and how this solar chariot came from northwest Europe to Greece.56 Sprockhoff traced the development from a horse-drawn sun image-which had its highest artistic realization in the fourteenth cen- tury B.C. Trundholm chariot found in Denmark-to a swan chariot- the most remarkable of which is the Dupljaja model of around the twelfth century B.C. found in Yugoslavia.57 The bronze Trundholm "chariot" is a horse mounted on wheels followed by a solar disk, mounted on wheels. The Dupljaja model is a chariot; in it is inscribed a solar disk upon which an anthropomorphic figure rides. The chariot poles develop into swans at the extremities: The swans are the chariot, just as the Alcaeus fragment would have us believe was true of Apollo's chariot: KUKVOI T' ijoav TO dippa. "The model," it has been observed, "is essentially the exact equivalent of the Trundholm chariot, with birds taking the place of the horse, and a human figure replacing the upright disk. "58 In the Dupljaja model the sun motif has been subordinated to the anthropomorphic representation; the swan entirely replaces the horse. No longer is there an obviously solar, driverless chariot with horse and sun; only a swan chariot with an anthropomorphic driver. The swan makes clearer sense as a solar bird in northern Europe than in the Mediterranean: its departure heralds the prolonged winter; its return the prolonged summer light. Hence, no doubt, the solar swan boat in Scandinavia, where the sun appears to move across the surface of the water rather than to set during summertime, as it does among the Laestrygonians (Od. 10.81-86). In the south, the swan's return heralds winter and coldness; its departure, spring. We should expect a paradoxical element in the Greek swan tradition. As with the Dupljaja chariot, we must remove the anthropomorphic figure to detect the solar 56 "Nordische Bronzezeit und fruhes Griechentum," Bremer Archdologische Blatter 3 (1962) 28-110 = Jahrbuch des romisch-germanischen Zentralmuseums 1 (1954) 28-110; cf.

How rightly you are called Apollo among mortals by anyone who knows the unspoken names of gods!59 As Apollo lurks beneath Helios, "sun," so "brightness" and "light" lurk beneath the Greek word kyknos, "swan." According to some etymological explanations kyknos derives from an Indo-European root meaning "shine."60 The solar myths linked with the swan in Greek suggest that Greeks too were aware of its solar implication. Further, Latin gradually set aside the word for swan it already had, and shared with Celtic-olor-in favor of the more mysterious cygnus, which is kyknos Latinized. Numerous Roman writers derive ignis, "fire" from gnasci or gigni, "to be born."61 Varro points out in Lingua Latina 5.64 that what in his day is written G was, by the ancients, written C: antiquis enim quod nunc G C; and he explains Ennius' etymology of Ceres from gerit (produces) in this way. Cygnus could then be related to (g)igni: the bird born by fire, the northern phoinix, if you will.62 Something similar was 59 The earliest certain identification of Apollo and Helios; see Diggle (note 54, above) ad loc. and pp. 147-48, who argues convincingly that Aeschylus Suppliants 212-14 makes this identification too.

Boisacq, Dictionnaire Etymologique de la Langue Grecque (Heidelberg/Paris 1923) 582 suggests a common root with Sanskrit ,ocati, "shine" and compares daXk6o and its Latin cognate albus. 61 Lucretius 1.891-92; 783-84; cf. J. M. Snyder, Puns and Poetry in Lucretius (Amsterdam 1980) 131-32. Note also Vergil's description of Cygnus' son's helmet (Aeneid 10.188): formaeque insigne paternae; Cygnus was metamorphosed in grief at Phaethon's fiery death. The element ignis lurks for the ancient writer trained in Plato and Varro in insignis and cygnus. 62 On olor see A. Ernout and A.

The swan, then, like the phoinix is a sun bird, and it seems to have triumphed over its eastern counterpart in the cult of Apollo. We now turn to a myth recorded by Apollonius in Argonautica 4.611-17 just after his narration of the Argonauts' arrival at the Erida- nus where Phaethon's body smoulders, and where his sisters drop their amber tears into the water: But the Celts have another story: that these are the tears of Apollo, son of Leto, which are carried on the swirling waters, tears beyond number that he shed when he came to the Holy Hyperboreans. He left the gleaming heavens, exiled from his father, and angry about his son whom lovely Coronis had borne to him at the Amyrus estuary. That is the way the story is sung among those men. The reference is to Apollo's son Asclepius, killed by Zeus for, in effect, conferring immortality on mankind, for being a healer.63 Again we are reminded of rivalry between Apollo and Zeus. But we should also note that Asclepius was born, according to Pindar, Pythian 3, after being rescued from his dead mother's womb while she was being crem- ated on a funeral pyre.64 Thus the child is born, phoinix-like, from the flames and is himself destroyed by fire. In this Celtic version Apollo has replaced the Sun, Asclepius has replaced Phaethon. The swan has van- ished, as have the amber-bearing trees. In place of a grieving bird and grieving trees we have the grieving Apollo. Other versions of the solar chariot myth show different diver- gences from what is now the Ovidian canon. In Plato's Timaeus 22C-D, Amasis says there is an Egyptian version of Phaethon's death which explains it as "a realignment of things in heaven that move around the earth." Similarly Manilius, Astronomica 1.729-49: the Milky Way is the track of the sun's former course, changed when Phaethon lost con- 63 Apollo's explanation in Euripides' A Icestis for his banishment and servitude; cf.

Mani- lius reiterates the point in 4.834-40 and concludes that "all things change over a long period of time; then they return again to their old selves: in semet redeunt (839)." Philoponus says the visionary Empedotimus once called the Milky Way "the roadway for the souls traversing the Unseen World (i.e. Hades) that is in the sky" (On Aristotle, Meteorica 1.8). Bolton comments: . . For Empedotimus the circle of the Milky Way is at the same distance from the earth as the circle of the sun-it is the boundary of Pluto's realm, Hades. This would accord with a Pythagorean belief that the Milky Way marks a former orbit of the sun (Arist. Met. 1.8 345a 14).65 We should surely add D'Arcy Thompson's observation of the swan, cited earlier: "the stellar Swan lies in the Milky Way, 'the River of Heaven."' This northerly swan constellation emerges, then, from the wreck of Phaethon's chariot, from the River of Heaven. At the heart of the swan myth is its astral significance. Phaethon "dirtied up the clean universe with his ashes-Phaethontea mundum squalere favilla (Thebaid 1.221)," not just the earth. When he died the swan became a star. Perhaps, when things "revert to their previous state," the swan star will again become the swan sun, much as Plato's fallen soul in the Phaedrus will grow its wings and fly again. VIII. Amber and the sun Like Delos before Apollo's birth, the river Eridanus migrates about the map, and, from Aratus' time, becomes a constellation, replac- ing the older "River" (Phaenomena 359-60). In astral terms the Erida- nus is a small scale duplicate of the Milky Way. So we must preface any discussion of the Eridanus with the caveat that it leads two existences, like Heracles' wraith in the Odyssey, one among the gods. Ancient tradition generally has Phaethon fall into the Eridanus, but does not agree where the Eridanus is. Aeschylus identifies it with the Rh6ne (fr. 73 Nauck2 = fr. 107 Mette); Herodotus knew, but did not believe, the tradition that it flowed into the northern ocean where amber is supposed to come from (3.115). Later writers identify it with the Po, even though there is no more trace of amber in the Po than of 65Bolton (note 18, above) 202, note 11 and 151-53; Cicero Rep. 6.16. 394</page><page sequence="23">AMBER, AVALLON, AND APOLLO'S SINGING SWAN singing swans on it.66 Amber was probably traded down from north Europe to the Adriatic via Po and the Rh6ne. But neither river was the the source of amber. Amber was prized for its perfume, warmth, electrical properties, and ability to preserve life in its resin.67 It was a symbol of the sun itself in parts of Baltic Europe. "In the culture of the ancient Baits," Arnolds Spekke notes, "amber discs are the oldest known symbols of sun wor- ship."68 To Greeks and Romans amber was also suggestive of the sun. Pliny (NH 37.31) says amber is called electrum because the sun is called elector; and Homer compares an amber necklace to the sun in Odyssey 18.296. The two northern sun symbols, swans and amber, surely met in the Baltic, and along the western "amber shores" of Jutland, the areas producing the traceable amber of European antiquity. For it has been established that most amber in Mycenaean sites is Baltic.69 The amber sources were reached in antiquity from the Black Sea, up the Bug and Dniester rivers, thence to the Vistula and out into the Baltic; the return route would have followed the Oder or Elbe, then the Rhine to the Saone/Rh6ne or the Po.70 And the possibility of seaborne trade between Greece and northern Europe is finally being seriously considered. Harding and Hughes Brock suggest seaborne as well as river trade occurred between the Baltic and Greece in three phases: "about 1600 B.C., possibly also about 1500 B.C., and about 1200 B.C." After that, reduced trade reached Greece via the Adriatic. The Britons, they suggest, may have served as middlemen between the Mycenaean buyers and the 66 Marseilles, at the estuary of the Rh6ne/Sa6ne "Eridanus," was founded by Phocaeans who fled from Asia Minor in 540 B.C. Before leaving they threw red hot iron into the sea (Herodotus 1.165). For the Po as an amber source, see Krappe (note 37, above) 354-56. 67 See Pliny, NH 37.30ff; Martial, Epigrams 4.32; 59; 6.15.

Experts on ancient metallurgy agree "there is now good evidence for trade in amber and tin between northern Europe and the British Isles, and some evidence for the extension of this trading pattern down the river valleys of Europe into the Mediterranean and Adriatic."72 The Greeks either went north for tin or north Europeans brought it to Greece by trade or by south- ward migration.73 There is a parallel between the southward migration of the solar swan and the trade in Baltic amber and British tin. Greek land and sea contact with north Europe in the Bronze Age must not be ruled out because later generations did not have such contact. This would be like saying that trade between Britain and the Mediterranean before the Arab conquest of Spain and Morocco is 71 Note 69, above, pp. 152-53.

Diodorus 5.22 tells of the overland transport of tin in classical times; Caesar BG 6.17, says the Celts' chief god and patron of all arts was Mercury, whose metal was tin; tin is the metal of Celtic Europe and the West. In Plato's Atlantis, set up in concentric circles as ancients thought the planets were, the inner circle around the central island was coated with tin; cf. Proclus on Timaeus 14B and Bouche-Leclerc (note 54, above) 315. 73 "The Mycenaeans would not themselves have gone to Northern Europe or the British Isles, but would have become prosperous by controlling the southern-presumably maritime-end of the trade-route," Maddin, Muhly, Wheeler (note 72, above) 42; cf.

The rise of Carthage, the struggles with the near East, Celtic expansion and bellicosity in the Hallstatt and La Tene periods, would have decreased trade contacts between Greece and the north in Classical times.74 Further, the decline of bronze in favor of iron reduced the critical need for such contact.75 When Greeks began to find their way to North Europe as Carthage weakened-or ceased to be hostile-they were quite possibly rediscov- ering old routes, not finding routes for the first time. Past memories were preserved in myth and local tradition, and were regarded with considerable suspicion. One such tradition is found in the myth of Phaethon and Cygnus. The Hellenistic Greek credited with the (re)discovery of north Europe is Pytheas of Marseilles, who travelled around Britain, into the North Sea and the Baltic. His voyage was made about a century before Apollonius' Argonautica-a fact of importance for interpreting the epic-some time between 326 and 265 B.c.76 Modern scholars accept his voyage as genuine, though they differ as to where he went. Most ancients were skeptical, as Lucian was, of all travellers' tales. The part of Pytheas' journey that concerns us is reported by Pliny, NH 37.35-36. Pytheas reported that a people named Gotones (Goths, probably) live near an inlet of Ocean, named Metuonis, which extends for 6,000 stades.77 A day's sailing away is an island named Abalus (or Abalum) to which, in springtime, matter is washed up from the frozen 74 On the later decline of trade between Greece and the north, see Hawkes (note 70, above); R.

AHL sea: concreti maris purgamentum. The inhabitants use it as wood for fire-pro ligno ad ignem-and sell it to their neighbors the Teutoni. Timaeus, Pliny adds, believes this, but calls the island Basilia. It is certain, he continues (37.42) that amber is created-gigni-in the islands of the northern Ocean and that it is called glaesum by the Germans. Hence Roman troops called one of the islands Glaesaria when Germanicus campaigned there (A.D. 16). In NH 4.104 Pliny con- firms his report. Across from Britain in the German Sea are the Glaesa- riae which more recent Greek travellers have called Electrides because electrum, i.e. amber, is born there (nasceretur).78 Pliny uses a lot of Varronian etymologies in his discussion of amber, as the excerpts show. The notion of fire in wood, ignis in lignis, which Lucretius (1.891-92) mocks, appears in Pliny's pro ligno ad ignem. His odd use of verbs indicating birth, and, in the case of gigni, fiery birth, shows his awareness of the myth of amber's "birth." His statement that amber is called electrum because elector was a name for the sun reminds us that amber is a sun "product." Pliny correctly identifies glaesum as the (Germanic) word for amber. It comes, as does kyknos, from a root meaning "shine," whence the English "glisten" and the modern direct derivative "glass." The amber islands, then, are shining islands, appropriately linked with the sun and the swan.79 IX. Cronus and his sea We have seen that Apollo's mother and his temple, replete with swans, are associated with a Hyperborean island. Is there a northern island, corresponding to Delos, that would explain these Greek legends that seem related to or derived from Northern tradition?

Pliny, NH 4.95 who reports that Xenophon of Lampsacus (see Sallman, p. 85 and note 96) called the island Baltia; Pytheas, Basilia. 79 On the etymology of Glas and its relationship to OE glaer, see F.

Beyond is the Cronian Sea: ultra deinde Cro- nium. We do not know for sure what "Cronian" means. It is generally accepted as a version of Celtic croinn, "frozen"-though it also resem- bles Celtic cruinn, "roundness, universe" and, to a lesser extent, cron- ach, "sickle."80 It could mean Universal Sea, i.e. Ocean, as easily as Frozen Sea. Pliny tells us what Morimarusa means. So the task is to determine the language. It is not Germanic; but it could be Celtic, either Goidelic or Cymric: muir (sea), marbh (dead); mor (sea), marw (dead). If the Cimbri called the sea morimarusa, they were probably Celtic rather than Germanic.81 The Morimarusa is never mentioned again. The Cronian Sea occurs often, usually as either the North Sea or "Ocean." Greek writers identify it with Cronus, Zeus' father. The On Rivers, attributed to Plutarch, says Cronus fled beyond the Caucasus mountains to Boreas' resting-place, and gave his name to the northern sea next to it (5.3).82 Only Apollonius, Argonautica 4.448-556, sets the Cronian Sea in known land: off the Italian coast. Now Apollonius was hardly a fool when it came to geography. He is the first writer to mention the Rhine (4.631); and his knowledge is almost certainly based on accounts by Pytheas, Timaeus, and other explorers and geographers.83 But he does 80 Croinn, "frozen," might be the Celtic for mare concretum in Pliny NH 4.104; see Carpenter (note 74, above) 178. 81 T. G. F. Powell, The Celts (London 1958) 163: "It is important to fore- go... ethnological deductions about the Cimbri on the basic of their geographical starting point. The personal names of their leaders ... are all purely Celtic, and passages from Diodorus, Strabo, and Pliny could all be taken as showing that the Cimbri spoke a Celtic language. "Teutones" itself is a Latin form of the Celtic word for "people" as ... in the Irish tuath and in the Gaulish deity name Teutates." Classicists usually take the Cimbri to be Germanic; the Oxford Latin Dictionary (s.v. Cimber) describes them as a German tribe but cites an example stating that Cimbri is their name lingua Gallica!; cf. H. Furneaux, Cornelii Taciti De Germania (Oxford 1894) on Germ. 37.1. A number of "Germans" in Tacitus are probably Celtic: the prophetess Velaeda (Hist. 4.61, Germ. 8.3; cf. Statius, Silvae 1.4.90; Dio 67.5) comes from across the Rhine, yet her name is the Celtic for prophet (cf. Irish fili(d)). 82 Since Ocean supposedly flowed round the world, the northeasterly direction of the Caucasus is no problem. For many Greeks the Black Sea was the end of known land. The river Phasis, and beyond it, the Caspian, were the streams of Ocean; cf. Bolton (note 18, above) 55-59 and map 1. 83 Apollonius (Argon. 4.627-35) describes Eridanus as rising at the world's end, at the Gates of Night, and spreading into three branches, one going to Ocean, one to the Ionian sea, one to the Adriatic.

He tells us we will find these adventures in Italy and in the islands off the coast of Marseilles, the fles d' Hyeres.84 We will go through the Cronian Sea to Marseilles: Pytheas' home town. Apollonius strikes a wicked blow at Pytheas' claims of sailing in northerly Cronian Seas. Apollonius and other Alexandrian poets, notably Callimachus in Aetia fr. 7.19-21, are largely responsible for the Mediterranean geography of Greek mythic voyages accepted by modern scholars. Plutarch gives the most spectacular accounts of the Cronian Sea.85 His friend Demetrius of Tarsus went to Britain late in the first century A.D. and visited an island off the coast inhabited only by a few holy men whom it was a crime to attack.86 There he learned of another island where Cronus is imprisoned in lasting sleep, attended by demi-gods and guarded by Briareus.87 A similar story appears in the On the Face in the Circle of the Moon 941A, where the sea around Cronus' island is called the Cronian Sea, and the island itself Ogygia or one of the islands near Ogygia, beyond the Pillars of Heracles. The peoples of Cronus finally adapted to non-Greek language and customs (941D); but their Hellenic spirit was rekindled by Heracles. Then Plutarch's narra- 84 M.

He even anticipates in his thoughts everything Zeus does (941E-942B). Max Pohlenz was right in seeing northern European legend at the bottom of this; but subsequent scholars have been reluctant to consider this possibility, even though Plutarch's narrator claims the story comes from the peoples in the vicinity of this island five days' sailing from Britain, beyond the Pillars of Heracles.88 Cherniss notes that the Pillars of Heracles are said to have had the older names of "Pillars of Briareus," and, before that, "Pillars of Cronus."89 "Pillars" is a poor rendition of the Greek stelai, as Carpenter points out; we would do better to call them "Boundary Stones."90 They are boundaries between one world and another. Cronus' island, like Pytheas' Abalus, is set in the Cronian Sea, and like Abalus-and the Hyperboreans-lies beyond the limits of our knowledge. Cronus' eternal sleep is a kind of death: his Boundaries are those between life and death as well as the Straits of Gibraltar. Reality is double, as Plutarch suggests in On the Face, when describing the 88 RE Band II, 2013. There is no need to presume Poseidonius is the source, as he suggests. Demetrius would have had his own observations and reports. Possibly parallel to Cronus among Northern gods is the Celtic deity usually named Cernunnos, represented on the Altar of the Four Gods found in Paris in 1711, and who may be the same as the deity represented on the Gundestrup bowl found in Jutland and dating to the period of the Cimbrian migrations (second and first centuries B.C.); see J. Whatmough, The Dialects of Ancient Gaul (Cambridge, Mass. 1970) 511-20; cf. E. C. Cawte, Ritual Animal Disguise (Cambridge 1978) 197. The text of the Altar inscription is uncertain; Whatmough reads Cernenus rather than Cernunnos. The god on the Gundestrup bowl (universally agreed to be of Celtic manufacture) wears stag's antlers on each of which is a Celtic torque. See Mellink and Filip (note 17, above), plate 412 and accompanying commentary; cf. Lucian's Cronus satires where the god is represented returning not in chains, but radiant and carrying a sickle (harpe). In Goidelic Celtic, sickle is cronach. Saturn, the Roman Cronus, is usually blessed, happy, symbolic of freedom; see Bouche-Leclerc (note 54, above). He was Phainon, "the shining one," to the astronomer; Diodorus 2.30.3 says the Babylonians called him "the Sun"-or, as Bouche-Leclerc has it-"the Old Sun" (p. 93, note 2); cf. Servius on Aeneid 1.729. Saturn is the best planet for physicians (Seneca, NQ 7.29) and is taken by neo-Pythagoreans and neo-Platonists to be god of time (Chronos): Tertullian, Ad Nat. 2.12; Augustine, City of God 6.8; Macrobius, Saturnalia 1.8.6-7; Sallustius, On the Gods and the Universe 3. Some of Cronus' "exiled Sun god" lore resembles that of Apollo and Asclepius. Plutarch's myth of Cronus recalls Critias' Atlantis in Plato, Timaeus 21A-25D and Critias 108E-121C.

Irish storytellers distinguish, between 'adventures' (echtrai) and 'voyages' (immrama), "the latter involving visits to a number of other- world islands."92 Greeks did not; but they were aware of the coexistence of "literal" and "symbolic" meanings in a text.

The obvious connection is with Celtic abal(l)o, or avallo, usually (and too precisely) translated: "apple." There is also a local Celtic name Abal(l)us, and a god Abel(l)io worshipped in Aquitania.94 The doublet Glass Island/Apple Island is best known in Arthur- ian tradition; and A. H. Krappe argued a connection between that Arthurian tradition and Pliny's Glass Island/Abalus doublet.95 Scholars have praised Krappe, but shied away from his theory. So we must go over some of the ground again, but in a rather different way. Around A.D. 1191, the monks of Glastonbury Abbey, on the orders of the recently deceased Henry II, excavated at Glastonbury for the tomb of King Arthur. It was rumored that Arthur had risen from the grave as Arthur, son of Geoffrey of Anjou and Constance of Britanny. Henry, out of antiquarian interests, and for political reasons, wanted to show no resurrection or metempsychosis had occurred.96 So did the Church. 9' See Verniere (note 84, above) 271-94; Plutarch, On the Face 943B; On Isis and Osiris 367D-E. 92Alwyn and Brinley Rees, Celtic Heritage (London 1961) 314. 93 See notes 14 and 35, above. 94 See Whatmough (note 89, above) 333; 528; 548; cf.

To prove you have a vampire's grave, everything must correspond to the tradition. William of Malmesbury gave the formula for identifying Glas- tonbury as Avallon, the traditional burial place of Arthur, in his The Antiquity of the Church at Glastonbury some forty years before the excavation; and there was strong local tradition to this effect.97 The excavation itself is described by Gerald of Wales in De Principis Instructione 1.20 and Speculum Ecclesiae 2.9. Gerald also outlines the tradition. Glastonbury is known by two names: 1. Inis Avallon, "that is to say 'Apple Producing Island'-insula pomifera-for the place once abounded in apples, which are called in British (Celtic) aval." 2. Inis gutrin, "that is to say 'Glass Island'-insula vitrea; whence the Saxons who succeeded the British used to call it Glastonbury. For Glas in their language means vitrum and buri means castrum or civitas." He adds that Avallon may also derive from one Vallo, who lived there a long time ago. William's account is identical, except that he calls the mysterious Vallo "Avalloc" and says he lived there with his daughters "on account of the secret of the place-propter loci secretum." Gerald concedes that no apples grow there in his day; and that the place is not an island, but a quasi insula. Yet the monks claim to have found an impressive tomb and not only Arthur's body, but Guinevere's, complete with a lock of hair that drove a monkish excavator wild, but turned into dust as he seized it. Finally a cross was found with an inscription announcing that this is the famous Arthur-inclitus rex Arthurus (not a lesser Arthur); that the burial place was Avallon-in insula Avallonia sepultus (tomb inscriptions usually assume you know where you are); that Guinevere is Arthur's second wife. Glastonbury specialized in bodies of the famous. It also claimed to be the place Joseph of Arimathea came to-the Joseph who placed Jesus' body in the tomb. As R. S. Loomis observes, it was "a school of forgery." In an age of forgery, we might add.98 The ingredients of this tradition suggest a parallel between the Arthurian Avallon and Glass Island legend and Pliny's Abalus and 97 See S. Pearce, The Kingdom of Dumnonia: Studies in History and Traditions in South Western Britain A.D. 350-1150 (Padstow, Cornwall 1978). 98 R. S.

AHL Glaesariae, as Krappe has convincingly argued.99 We might add to Krappe's arguments that "Glass Island" makes better sense in terms of Pliny's "Glaesariae" and amber than in terms of Glastonbury and "glass." Although Glastonbury had a glass-making industry in the 9th and 10th centuries A.D., Gerald does not seem even to have known about it, much less used it to justify his argument.?00 Pytheas had surely encountered the original "Glass" Islands; whether he had encountered the original Avallon is another matter. For Abalus will not yield its mysteries quite so easily. But possibly there was, around 300 B.C., in Southern Scandinavia, land of amber, swans, Bronze Age inscribed drawings, and the Trundholm chariot, a community using both Germanic and Celtic languages that had the same mythical doublet we find at Glastonbury fifteen hundred years later. This should not be too surprising. From this area Germanic settlers came to England in historical times, and, according to Celtic tradition, at Celtic invitation. They had probably been coming for centuries before, and may have constituted a bilingual society with the Celts. The trade routes between the Wessex culture and Scandinavia date back to neolithic times. And Glastonbury is at the western fringes of the Wessex culture.'10 When the Romans left Britain in A.D. 410, the movements of people and cultures, blocked for three and a half cen- turies, resumed. XI. The song of the sea Celtic mythic heroes are often lured to otherworld lands by strange women and strange music. In the Voyage of Bran, Bran is lulled to sleep by mysterious music. An unknown woman appears, telling him she holds a branch from the apple-tree of Emhain, and informing him of an island around which sea-horses gleam. He travels towards it and meets Manannan MacLir, king of the sea, who tells Bran that Bran is returning to Ireland after many years. Upon his return, Bran announces his identity but is told no such person is known, but that the Voyage of Bran is one of Ireland's ancient stories.102 Similarly Cormac is given a 99 Notes 36 and 77, above. 100 See Lloyd Laing, The Archaeology of Late Celtic Britain and Ireland (London 1975) 267; cf.

He then travels to a kind of paradise where there are houses thatched with white bird wings.103 The mysterious woman, the island, the song of sleep, apples or other fruits on the island, and waterbirds-usually swans-are common motifs in Irish myth. To travel to otherworld islands is to voyage into sleep, death, and timelessness-to sleep the sleep of Cronus, to travel in his sea, or in the Morimarusa. The voyager may return like the time- traveller in Einstein's thought experiments to find that a year for him has been centuries for mankind. Such is Bran's fate. The island of Avallon is this kind of otherworld island. Gerald (Speculum Ecclesiae 2.9) observes contemptuously: "The Britons, who believe anything, and their bards came up with the myth that a woman with magical powers, named Morgan, removed Arthur's corpse to the Island of Avallon to heal his wounds.... When he has recovered, he will return." The mysterious Morgan has a special place in Celtic lore: "a fairy, eternally young. ... Her place of abode is beneath the sea.... By moonlight she combs her fair hair with a comb of fine gold, and she sings in a harmonious voice a plaintive melody whose charm is irresist- ible. The sailor who listens to it feels himself drawn towards her, without the power to break the charm which drags him onward to his destruction."'04 In this Morgan we see traces of Sirens and Loreleis; and her name, in Breton or Welsh, suggests "song of the sea." Indeed, the Fata Morgana were known to all sailors until recent times. Arthur's escort to Avallon, then, is distinctly otherworldly, as is his wife Guine- vere, whose name means "White Ghost": Gwenhwyfar.105 Greek myth has its own mysterious songs of the sea. The best known is that of the winged sirens, whom Sophocles calls "daughters of Phorcys" (fr. 861, Pearson), and whose song is described in Odyssey 12.156-200. There is also the singing garden of the Hesperides, beyond Ocean, whose song is often baleful to sailors.106 103 Ibid., 310-13; cf. 305-7 and The Wasting Sickness of CuChulainn. 104W. Evans Wentz, The Fairy Faith in Celtic Countries (Oxford 1911) 200. 105 In Irish myth there is a male Morgan whose daughter lives in the sea and is sought by Art, son of Conn. Art stops at an island full of apple trees, beautiful birds and bees, and beautiful women living in a house thatched with bird feathers. See A. and B. Rees (note 92, above) 260-62; Irish myth also has three bloodthirsty and ugly morrigna, "great queens" (ibid., 35-36). For Fata Morgana: R. S.

AHL By the singing Hesperides other daughters of Phorcys, "ruler of the sea" as he is called in Odyssey 1.72, live: the Graiae and the Gorgons. The latter Aeschylus describes as three "swan shaped" women (PB 795). Although the gorgons, like the swan maidens of central Asiatic tales, are generally represented as ugly in Greek myth, Pindar suggests (Pythian 12.16) that even Medusa has "beautiful cheeks"; and in modern Greek usage, gorgons are singing mermaids.'07 The whiteness of the gorgons, like the whiteness of swans, may be either attractive or ugly. Diodorus (5.32) says Celtic children are born old (i.e. whitish haired), as is Cygnus in Hesiod, fr. 237; and we have seen the phenomenon elsewhere: the swan is symbolic of the old poet as well as of the eternally youthful god of poetry. Further, Pindar tells us (Pythian 12.23) that Athena imitated the gorgons' song when she invented the "melody of many heads," a puzzling phrase which could suggest music in several vocal parts.'08 The morgans of Celtic tradition have something in common, then, with the Greek gorgons. A curious linguistic similarity brings them even closer. R. S. Loomis has pointed out there might well be a Celtic M/G doublet: the British underworld king Maelwas may appear as Galehos (Galahad).109 Since mormo is attested as a variant of gorgo in Greek, it is possible that morgan and gorgo have a common Indo- European origin. The most famous gorgon, Medusa, was killed by Perseus-like Heracles, a son of Zeus. As in the Cygnus legends, we note the hostility of Zeus' children to those associated with swans. According to Pindar, Pythian 10.45, Perseus killed Medusa in the land of the Hyperboreans, near the singing Hesperides, perhaps, where the gorgons were said to live.10 107 J. C. Lawson, Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion (Cambridge 1910) 184. 108 See Dodds (note 21, above) 162; cf. Bolton (note 18, above) 102. There is no evidence for polyphony in the few surviving fragments of Greek music: E. Pohlmann, Denkmaler A ltgriechischer Musik, Erlanger Beitrage zur Sprach- und Kunstwissenschaft, Band 31 (Nurenberg 1970). But as the Greeks knew of musical intervals within the octave there is no reason why they could not have made chords. G. K. Gresseth, "The Homeric Sirens," TAPA 101 (1970) 203-18, notes that in Greek art sirens look like gorgons and are always winged (213; 215). "Siren" may be from Seir "sun": J.

Of these the first is father of Geryon-who lived in an island called Erytheia in the far west of Europe, and who was killed by Heracles.11 The other is Pegasus. Medusa supposedly slept with Poseidon before her death. From this union of horse-god and swan maiden, a white winged horse with strong solar symbolism is appropriate issue."2 Pegasus, like the swans, soon takes his place with Apollo and Music, astrally as well as in purely literary contexts. This association of horse and musical bird is found in Celtic myth too. In the Mabinogion, the banqueters delighting in the feast at Harlech, all seven of them, spend seven years listening to the song of the white birds of Rhiannon, the Welsh equivalent of Epona."3 And the poet who would rival the song of the great birds had first to attire himself in a cloak of birdfeathers to sing the magic song that beguiles time.14 The most interesting feature of Celtic music, Gerald suggests (Description of Wales 1.13), is that you never hear a song with only one vocal part. Out of ancient custom, not through training, he says, the Welsh differ from other people. They sing in multiple parts. The men of Yorkshire-itself, though Gerald does not mention it, part of the once Celtic Elfed-sing in two parts, a skill learned from Scandinavians. Everyone else uses only one vocal line. Given the conservatism of Celtic culture in general, the tradition of multi-partite singing may be of great antiquity. It might account for the awe Greeks felt for the music "' On Chrysaor and Geryon, see Hesiod, Theogony 280-94 and 979-83 with M. L. West's notes; Apollodorus 2.4.2; 2.5.10. On Pegasus, see N.

Fine testimony to the swan-horse relationship occurs at the Pazyryk burials in Siberia, dating from the fourth and third centuries B.C. where horses were buried with all the humans. In the fifth barrow, as ornaments over the burial wagon, were four felt swans: S. Rudenko, Frozen Tombs of Siberia, tr. M. Thompson (Berkeley 1970) 41-44, 117, and plates 131 and 166. Swans also decorate bridles (p. 152; fig. 64; plate 97A). The excavation confirms Herodotus (4.71-75) and Strabo (7.4.8) on the Scyths. Horses were the Scyths' commonest sacrificial animal (Herodotus 4.61); cf. J. Puhvel, "Victimal hierarchies in Indo-European animal sacrifices," AJP 99 (1978) 345-62. The association of horse and swan in burials may explain the swan charioteer Amphiaraus, "king of the dead." 14 N. K. Chadwick, Poetry and Prophecy (Cambridge 1942) 58; cf. A. and B.

Someone who has heard multiple vocal harmony might go on to contemplate the nature of chords. XII. Apollo's third tree A Byzantine writer, Ioannes Geometres, observes that while other trees were attributed to Aphrodite or Dionysus, the apple, palm, and laurel alone were consecrated to Apollo.15 Servius says a man named Melus, born on Delos, was metamorphosed into an apple when he hanged himself from a tree in grief at Adonis' death.16 Thucydides tells of a cult of Apollo Maloeis at Mitylene (3.3.3); and Lucian mentions apples as prizes at the Pythian games.17 We could suggest that, though the northern swan replaced the phoinix sun bird in the Apollo cult, the middle eastern phoinix palm replaced the northern apple: aballo. Unfortunately Greek melon means almost any kind of fruit; it also means "sheep," as Servius notes when talking about Melus. Byzan- tine lexicographers under mela list "all quadrupeds."18 As the Greek melon is impossibly broad, our "apple" is impossibly narrow. Little- wood's study of apple symbolism understandably fails to include quad- rupeds; but neither does it cover trees bearing edible nuts. The omission is significant because Celtic aballo or avallo, normally rendered "apple"-as in modern Welsh and Breton-is not necessarily restricted to fruit. In Scots Gaelic, abhall means "orchard," not just "apple.""9 Its range includes Greek kepos, "orchard" as well as the fruitier side of melon. Latin writers help here. Silius (Punica 8.543) describes the Italian town Abella as poor in agricultural produce. But Vergil calls it "apple- producing," "the orchard town"-maliferae Abellae-in Aeneid 7.740. Yet when Romans thought of Abella, hazelnuts-Abellanae or Abellinae-not apples usually came to mind (Celsus De Medicina 3,27B; Pliny NH 15.88). 115 See A. R. Littlewood, "The Symbolism of the Apple in Greek and Roman Literature," HSCP 72 (1967) 147-81 (p. 160). 116 On Eclogues 8.37; cf.

People would want these same fruits for the journey of death. Appropriately the hazelnut tree, like the apple, was important to Celts and Germans, as Alwyn and Brinley Rees show in their description of the Well of Segais, or Connla's Well: Like Mimir's Well at the root of the Scandinavian world tree, this well was the source of inspiration and knowledge. Over it grew the nine hazels of wisdom "out of which were obtained the feats of the sages." The hazelnuts dropped into the well and caused bubbles of mystic inspiration to form on the stream that issued from it. Alternatively the nuts were eaten by the salmon in the well, or they were passed into the river Boyne. Those destined to partake of the nuts of the salmon obtained the gifts of the seer and the poet.121 There was such a well at Uisnech called by Irish poets the "navel" of Ireland.122 The world tree, the nine hazels of wisdom, the poetic and prophetic gifts won by those who partook of the fruit, are matched in Apollonian lore. The parallel between this "navel" and the omphalos at Delphi has often been made; and Apollo's sister was honored as Artemis Caryatis in the Laconian town of Caryae-town of the nut-trees (Gk. karya = particularly hazelnuts, according to Theophrastus).'23 Apollo's name, as Krappe suggests, may derive from the Celtic aballo.124 It has no clear etymology in Greek. To Socrates in the Cratylus Apollo was "the Deliverer: Apoluon," "the Purifier: Apollouon," "the Eternal Shooter: Aeiballon," "the Together in Harmony: Alpha," both the "Destroyer; Apolo" and "the Destroyed: Apolola." He sought a Greek etymology explaining the god's nature.125 120 H. R. Ellis Davidson, Pagan Scandinavia (London 1967) 120; T.

AHL Romans took a different approach. In a passage cited earlier, Vergil describes Cygnus whitening into a swan while singing (Aen. 10.191) His transformation takes place among the poplar leaves and the shade of his sisters: populeas inter frondes umbramque sororum. Ovid develops this in Metamorphoses 1.157. The rivers of the country- popularia flumina-come to visit the recently metamorphosed Daphne's father; among them is the poplar-bearing-populifer-Spercheios (1.579). In 2.515-16, Phaethon's fires turn entire nations with all their peoples-cumque suis... populis-into ashes. Finally, Phaethon has flame ravaging-populante-his red hair (2.319). There is a multiple word-play on the base popul- which becomes "popular," "poplar," and "destroyed." Ovid does not tell us into what trees Phaethon's sisters were changed, nor does he name the Sun Apollo. Like Euripides' Cly- mene in the Phaethon, he leaves this for the reader to discover. Modern explanations of Apollo's name look rather like Socrates' and Ovid's: we try Apolo, "destroy"-Ovid's populante; Apellon, "black poplar tree"-Ovid's populus; finally Apellai, "public meetings"-Ovid's populus.'26 Roman poets made much of the Phae- thon legend's poplars because they created a set of wordplays which translated etymologies from Greek, and linked the god with solar myths. XIII. Conclusion I doubt there is one original "northern" Apollo any more than there is one original "eastern" Apollo. Apollo's name, like his swan and his oracle, does not speak or hide; it gives signs of its meaning. His fruit-bearing trees, like his swans, have a symbolism not obvious in a Greek context. The palm was the life-sustaining plant for the Egyp- tians, the apple and hazelnut trees for more northerly people. The Greeks found the olive and vine more vital. Apollo yielded primacy to Dionysus and Athena. But the vegetation deity lurks in his name, his mysterious Hyperborean orchard, the Hesperides, his connection with the Hyacinth myth, with Artemis' hazelnut tree, and Leto's palm. The solar cult linked with the "Orchard God" combines the swan and tree symbols inasmuch as "swan" means "the shining one" in Greek, and inasmuch as the tears Apollo sheds for his dead son, or the tears of Phaethon's sisters, in other versions, are amber: solar "fruit." Apollo's Hyperborean temple or garden to which he travels in his swan 126 See Guthrie (note 22, above) 73-74, notes 1 and 2. 410</page><page sequence="39">AMBER, AVALLON, AND APOLLO'S SINGING SWAN chariot, his links with the amber myth, and with the enchanting music of the northern and western seas: these are the vertical threads of his identity. Since amber is found in numerous Bronze Age sites in Greece, but much less from then on until Roman times, the solar swan and the amber legend, if not the name Apollo, probably arrived during Myce- naean times. It is even possible that bronze, amber, and the solar swan cult came to Greece as the result of migration rather than simply trade. Myth shows us how vigorously Zeus' son Heracles fought against peo- ples of the north and west, and how hard the solar swan had to fight for its identity against rival cults whose solar symbolism was more obvious to Mediterranean peoples. At some point the swan cult either combined with or changed from being a female solar cult and became a dominantly male cult. "Sun" is feminine in Germanic, and often in Celtic, not masculine as in Greek and Latin. The Celtic Sun god Grannos, with whom Apollo is identified in Roman times as Apollo Grannos, is female.127 Greek and Roman myths, like Orpheus' soul, preserve traces of this sexual ambiguity. Apollo owes much, including his name, to the north. There may even be traces of an Apolline deity in the mysterious Vallo and Avellach after whom Gerald of Wales and William of Malmesbury say Avallon might be named. At the roots of the northern Glass Island and Avallon tradition is probably an Apollo-like island god linked to swans, singing maidens, amber, and the sun-a god who offers some prospect of a return from the enchanted voyage of death. This deity may well be the common ancestor of both Apollo's wondrous home, so beloved of poets, Pythagoreans, and Plato, and of Avallon to which the dying King Arthur is transported for millennial rebirth.
