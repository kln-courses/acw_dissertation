Department of Geography, University of Leicester In light of current attention to the 'everyday', this paper attends to the construction and negotiation of one particular building as an avowedly 'extraordinary place'. The paper examines how unusual mixtures of diverse properties (such as 'artwork' and 'tourist attraction') at the Hundertwasser-Haus in Vienna are always actively and collectively operated such that the house produces and maintains its extraordinariness. Moreover, it forwards the contention that a crucial way in which the extraordinary can be produced is in the meshing of the spectacular with the mundane, everyday and practical, rather than in a separation of the former from the latter. The paper concludes by considering how the complexities of this case study might allow us to reflect upon the critical role of extraordinariness in apprehending the geographies that we take most for granted.

We are meant to be exhibitors - even, exhibits (resident of the Hundertwasser-Haus since 19862). This part of the universe is what you call home - and although there are some references to other 'worlds', this house's world proves to be something new and whole. A special magic comes over you here, creating a relaxed mood of connectedness, and you feel yourself peacefully taken up.3 Imagine, most-visited for a cities moment, in Europe. living Not in one living of nearby, the most nor popular working tourist there attractions during the in day, one nor of pass- the most-visited cities in Europe. Not living nearby, nor working there during the day, nor pass- ing it occasionally; but living inside. Imagine the tourists who flock there in their thousands; gazing up at the bulbous, multi-coloured walls topped by trees; pressing their noses against the windows; photographing everything - the windows, the cobbled pavement, the posters for sale in the nearby shops; scanning the list of names beside the long row of door-buzzers. They expect celebrities to be housed behind those colourful, bulbous walls. In some ways, the residents are treated like celebrities, appearing in hundreds of strangers' photographs; but they are not famous. Such attention is lavished upon this place and its residents because, although this tourist attraction is a social housing apartment block, of which many more are dotted about Vienna (and thus, functionally, it is quite normal), it is extra-ordinary. It is not merely unique; for it is not hard to be unique. It is extra-ordinary, precisely because it should be very © 2009 SAGE Publications 10.1177/1474474008097982</page><page sequence="2">cultural geographies 16(1) FIGURE 1 The Hundertwasser-Haus, Vienna. (Author's photograph.) ordinary. The Hundertwasser-Haus (Figure 1) is social housing masquerading as artwork, as tourist attraction, as ecological polemic, as architectural harbinger. More accurately, it relies on the simultaneous and juxtaposed presence of all of these properties in order that any one of them retains its meaning. This paper attends to the construction and negotiation of the Hundertwasser-Haus in Vienna as an avowedly extra-ordinary place. It critically examines how its characteristic prop- erties (artwork, tourist attraction, etcetera), must actively operate, collectively, and always-also in an everyday , practical sense, such that the house maintains its extra-ordinariness. Essentially, then, the paper is concerned with how a place gains significance, because of, and through, the practices that render it extra-ordinary in an active and ongoing sense. Moreover, it forwards the contention that a crucial way in which the extraordinary can be produced is in the mesh- ing of the spectacular with the mundane, rather than a separation of one from the other. 112</page><page sequence="3">Kraftl: Living in an artwork I Geographies of extraordinary places On odd occasions, I am reminded of a question I once heard about banality. It went some- thing like: 'by attending to the mundane and the banal, do we not therefore render it some- thing very different (and not mundane and banal)'? This seems an adjunct to the conditions of banality and everydayness which have concerned so many writers4 of late. Yet it presents a simple truism about academic research: our research has the power to imbue the simplest, daftest, most mundane practice, object or place with tremendous importance. We even do this when we try to flag up its very banality. As geographers, then, we are always-also geog- raphers of the extra-ordinary. We justify; we generalize; we painfully prove that our research is worthwhile and important; we often yearn to be useful.5 It might be, then, that a recent attention to banal materials, practices, bodies and places could be read as a backlash against neady represent-able, overdy politicized, unmistakably useful, morally controvertible, socio- culturally 'important' geographies.6 For, we are constandy reminded, those geographies are also and otherwise political, useful, morally controvertible, and spectacular.7 The above observation seems to sit rather oddly with my previous assertion that the Hundertwasser-Haus in Vienna is an extra-ordinary place. The difficulty, then, comes in iden- tifying the difference between that which of necessity becomes extra-ordinary in the course of academic research, and that which also is or becomes extra-ordinary, external to such inves- tigation. It should be helpful, then, to return to the extra-ordinary as a thematic and empir- ical focus for academic investigation. I argue that extra-ordinariness is a social and socialising condition which is shared between individuals, and can certainly be discerned beyond aca- deme. In the case of the Hundertwasser-Haus, the building has become a famous landmark through the interaction of press coverage, mass tourism, academic critique and ('even') its residents' practices. These have combinatively and actively imbued the Hundertwasser-Haus with its extra-ordinary status. My question is, then, of what the qualitative difference is between that which becomes extra- ordinary as a result of academic intervention, and that which is extra-ordinary in excess of such attention. In this paper, I consider the characteristics of the extra-ordinary as a shared, affective, material and practiced geographical phenomenon. I argue that it is desirable to explore extraordinariness in this way; if only as an extension of and departure from the pervasive and insistent banality - the near-'hyper-ordinariness' - of much recent research. Moreover, this might provide an additional opportunity to reflect upon banality and every- dayness, and to re-consider why and how places gain particular types of significance. I do not advocate ignoring the banal and everyday - indeed, the extra-ordinariness of the Hundertwasser-Haus is produced through tourists' and inhabitants' daily practices. Instead I argue that social scientists are now presented with an opportunity and methodology to build upon a focus on banality, in order to renew our efforts towards exploring the significance of extra-ordinariness at places like the Hundertwasser-Haus. The extra-ordinary geographies of the Hundertwasser-Haus in Vienna require further con- textualization in light of three themes apparent in recent cultural geographic research: extra- ordinariness as a socio-spatial phenomenon; (public) art, architectural symbolism and the spectacular; and, practical, engaged, everyday geographies of art and architecture. I consider each of these in turn. 113</page><page sequence="4">cultural geographies 16(1) 1 Extraordinariness as a socio-spatial phenomenon The variously spectacular spaces of modernity and capitalism have provided fertile ground for considering extraordinariness. For historical geographers and sociologists, rapidly urbanizing Victorian Britain has been associated with socio-spatial phenomena which varied from the spectacular to the terrifying. The chaotic Victorian city was becoming a site for bourgeois moral disgust - but this was a landscape which could simultaneously be re-imagined as a field of desire or a world of exciting voyeuristic opportunity for the aloof flaneur.8 Urban life had become a spectacle for those privileged enough to appreciate it as such. Simultaneously, related developments in science and literature conveyed experiences of modernity which were extraordinary, terrifying and haunting. These developments included: the 'discovery' of geo- logical deep time and the Great Devonian controversy;9 media panic in coverage of high- profile criminal cases such as that of 'Jack the Ripper'; and the emergence of gothic horror and ghostly haunting as a popular subject for contemporaneous novelists.10 Herein, historical geographers have charted the socio-spatial and aesthetic production of modernity via spec- tacularization. They have also attended to the spatial orderings and practices11 fundamental to the construction of modernity. In this paper, I seek to similarly focus upon such processes in considering extraordinariness more pointedly. During the 20th century, the spectacular spaces of modernity became increasingly associ- ated with the progression of capitalism. In particular, the democratization of consumption heralded new and socio-culturally pervasive forms of spectacle. Numerous World's Fairs and exhibitions promoted (nationalist) developments in art, technology and architecture, pres- enting complex 'dream-worlds' on a monumental scale.12 Simultaneously, globalizing consumer capitalism was becoming reified and critiqued as a 'society of the spectacle'. These develop- ments led Guy Debord, Jean Baudrillard and many others to interrogate the invasive con- sumption in and of everyday life, which they argued had been rendered spectacular via processes of technological and visual mediation.13 One can discern the continuation of this debate in contemporary understandings of globalization, terrorism and war,14 and the emer- gence of what John Hannigan terms 'fantasy cities' such as Las Vegas.15 Such ongoing critiques invoke powerful claims regarding the appropriation of the spectacle (and, indeed, the extraordinary) by capitalism. In light of the above, perhaps one motive for the current attentiveness to everydayness lies precisely within critical efforts to subvert or resist the spectacularization of society. Both despite and as a result of this move, however, I contend that a more expansive and nuanced interrogation of extraordinariness might now be feasible. It should be instructive to extend a consideration of extraordinariness beyond the knowingly global, technologically mediated, dream-worlds of capitalist spectacle. As I discussed above, this would involve a critical exam- ination of how particular 'everyday', 'ordinary' places become and sustain themselves as extraordinary, via the explicit combination of the mundane and the spectacular. In the case of this paper, this involves scrutiny of how an individual social housing block perpetuates itself as tourist attraction, architectural harbinger, ecological statement and artwork. For, as I demonstrate below, the combination of the mundane and spectacular in the ongoing production of the extraordinary is clearly important to the tourists, residents and commentators who engage with the house. 114</page><page sequence="5">Krafil: Living in an artwork 2 (Public) art, architectural symbolism and the spectacular For many commentators and visitors, the Hundertwasser-Haus presents itself as a combina- tion of (public) art and architectural exemplar: in fact, it is from this characterization that the building began to attract attention. Yet the Hundertwasser-Haus is not alone in combin- ing art and architecture. Nor is its mixture of art with a more banal function (social hous- ing) unique. In fact, geographers concerned with the iconography and symbolism of built forms have demonstrated how certain 'everyday' architectural spaces such as shopping malls, canals, reservoirs and city streets may become spectacularized through their symbolic-visual association with ideologies as diverse as consumerism, nationalism and modernism.16 Therein, architecture appears to be an ideal site at which to observe the becoming-extraordinary of everyday places through the assertion of symbolic meaning. Many architects have, of course, imbued their work with a sense of the aesthetically spec- tacular, whether for political signification or otherwise: architectural historians' accounts of forms as diverse as Renaissance villas and skyscrapers have exemplified this.17 Moreover, elem- ents of futurist, technological or Utopian fantasy can be discerned in many architectural styles - including Modernism, Expressionism, Situationism and postmodernism.18 As I discuss later, Friedensreich Hundertwasser, the main creative impetus behind the Hundertwasser-Haus, was similarly concerned with architecture's symbolic power. As Pierre Restany argues: the act of constructing a la Hundertwasser was to imprint the hallmark of his creativity on the fragment of urban fabric entrusted to him, on the physical and human scale of the human environment. In this precise case, spec- ulation on the power of art assumed the air of a bet on the poetic quality of inhabited space. And since this was a public housing operation, the political gesture was doubly meaningful.19 Hundertwasser was keen to imbue the house with his own colourful style. But, as Restany puts it, Hundertwasser was not merely concerned that his own 'creativity' endured. He qualified his style with the very 'human scale' of the house, and rendered it most meaningful through the building's status as public housing. In other words, Hundertwasser's style blends the implicit (utopian) sensationalism of spectacular architecture with the very ordinary demands of pub- lic housing and the 'human scale'. 3 Practical, engaged, everyday geographies of architecture When the resident moves in, his [sic.] creative building activity must begin; it must not be finished when he moves in.20 Hundertwasser was adamant that the moment the first residents moved into the Hundertwasser-Haus signalled the beginning of the true construction of the building and its meaning. Under the rather dour term 'user participation', his sensibility can be linked with a long line of architects who promote user participation in design.21 Furthermore, leaving meaning and function open to emerge through inhabitation has become increasingly 115</page><page sequence="6">cultural geographies 16(1) fashionable - what Lars Lerup has eruditely termed 'building the unfinished'.22 Similarly, a number of recent urban art projects have sought to obfuscate or defer any clear indication of meaning or function.23 Like Hundertwasser, the designers of such projects demonstrate a politicized commitment to engaging general publics in the ongoing production of mean- ing in and as urban space.24 Cultural geographers, post-structural architectural theorists and urban planners (notably Iain Borden, Jane Rendell and Leonie Sandercock) have also called for a greater acknowledgment of the radical open-ness of architectural space to human inhabitation.25 Drawing inspiration from Henri Lefebvre, they seek to emphasize the multiple, politicized roles played by fleshy human bodies in performing urban spaces and architectures.26 Loretta Lees' call for a 'critical' geography of architecture crystallizes a number of these debates. Her research at a public library in Vancouver combines symbolic and textual approaches to architectural geography27 with an attention to the daily practices and experiences of those who inhabit buildings: Traditionally, architectural geography has been practiced by putting architectural symbols into their social (and especially historical) contexts to tease out their meaning. But if we are to concern ourselves with the inhabitation of architectural space as much as its signification ... we must [also] engage . . . actively with the situated and every- day practices through which built environments are used. ... If the aim of a more critical geography of archi- tecture must be to engage with those... practices through which architecture is inhabited, its understandings cannot be produced through abstract and a priori theorising.28 Jane Jacobs' recent work on high-rise buildings enlists an even greater cast of actors to explore - via a socio-technical lens - the vast array of idea(l)s, practices, bodies, materials and discourses which allow a building to cohere (or not).29 Her key analytical motif of the 'Black Box' depicts the closing-off of the massive, impenetrable complexity of socio-tech- nical systems (for instance, decisions regarding building regulations). Once closed off, a deci- sion, artefact or technology becomes more-or-less immutable, ready to be taken as liard fact', or to be deployed elsewhere.30 Despite allowing for a range of 'non-human' actors in the construction of architectures, Jacobs' considered and insightful analyses retain a (now decentred) place for the human inhabitation of buildings. In fact, Jacobs' work is also placed within a burgeoning current interest in the spaces, cultures and politics of the home. Although multi- disciplinary studies of the home have taken a number of directions, the socio-technical frame adopted by Jacobs, Elizabeth Shove and others highlights how 'home' is a co-production which holds together diverse materials, meanings, policies and practices.31 Hence, home is an 'orchestrating concept'32 around which variant technologies and practices may do the work of housing. Through the working of such concepts we witness the 'socio-technical co- production of domesticity' - the 'things' which meld together to give a home its identity and more-or-less assured ontological status.33 A number of further recent studies have attended to the symbolic and more-than- representational practices and materials through which architectural spaces are imbued with sig- nificance.34 In this sense, this paper constitutes a further attempt to build on Lees' and Jacobs' very different approaches to explore both the multiple inhabitations of the Hundertwasser-Haus and the coproduction of an - albeit culturally significant - piece of architecture. I loosely adopt Lees' 'critical' perspective on architectural inhabitation to explore how everyday practices in and around the Hundertwasser-Haus are in part constitutive of its 116</page><page sequence="7">Kraftl: Living in an artwork production as an extraordinary place. I also develop Jacobs' (and my own35) attention to the coproduction of ideas or (f)acts such as 'big things' and 'extra-ordinary houses' through archi- tectural practice. Yet in so doing I extend this work by asking two questions which scram- ble some of Jacobs' analyses. First, I question what happens not in the constitution or coproduction of home, but when home becomes other ? In other words, what are the socio-techn- ical systems that operate when a home (the Hundertwasser-Haus) becomes more than a home, more than the everyday, affective, material site of dwelling; when the relations that co-pro- duce a home spill over or are scrambled to coproduce an artwork or tourist attraction? Second, I question what happens when a Black Box of controversy is not closed off? For the kinds of debates that have been foreclosed elsewhere (about technical, aesthetic or mate- rial unfitness for purpose), and perhaps only emerge when a building becomes a 'failure'36 - are at the Hundertwasser-Haus simply a part of the fun. In the case of the Hundertwasser- Haus, certain components of the Black Box have remained open since the mid-1980s. Those controversies and discrepancies have become parts of popular and media debate around the house, and have been complicit in producing and perpetuating its extra-ordinariness. In the rest of the paper, I want to follow how extraordinariness is produced through the everyday geographies of a Viennese social housing block, and how that extra-ordinariness comes to matter. For the pruposes of this paper, I view everydayness and extra-ordinariness as complexly implicated in one another, rather than divorced or oppositional. As Michael Gardiner37 states, recent theorists have suggested that a theoretical trend towards defamiliar- ization - deconstructing the habitual character of everyday life - cannot be contrasted with, or divorced from, the extraordinary. In essence one may only understand the very temporary stabilization of everydayness or extraordinariness in the ongoing, relational and em-placed production of meanings attached to either/both. Extraordinariness comes to matter not merely in place but always-also as place. This process is broadly recursive and reflexive; to produce something 'out-of-the-ordinary' - to invoke a specific differentiation between the everyday and the extraordinary - requires material-discursive work. It may be proper to suggest that 'routine and creativity, the trivial and the extraordinary, are viewed as productively intertwined'.38 According to Gardiner, 'the key is not to privilege either the mundane or the exceptional, linear or cyclical temporalities, but to grasp how they inter-relate on the terrain of the totality that constitutes everyday life'.39 Therefore, my chosen narrative in this paper represents one cross-section through this productive process, concentrating on one site where everyday life is specifically and repetitively iterated as extra- ordinary. In particular, I seek to understand how the constitution of the extraordinary mat- ters as an everyday material practice and an emotional, aesthetic and even political concern at the Hundertwasser-Haus in Vienna. II The Hundertwasser-Haus, Vienna: constructing and negotiating extraordinariness The Hundertwasser-Haus (Figure 1) is located in the 3rd Bezirk (district) of Vienna, around fifteen minutes' walk from the city centre. It is a social housing block, designed by the afore- mentioned anti-modern artist-architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser. As Figures 1 and 2 117</page><page sequence="8">cultural geographies 16(1) illustrate, the house comprises very few straight lines, with green terraces at all levels and trees on the roofs, and presents an eclectic mix of styles. The Hundertwasser-Haus was commissioned by the city of Vienna for its public housing supply, and completed in 1986. The house has 52 apartments,40 available to all potential social housing beneficiaries in Vienna. In Austria, social housing is more widespread than in post-1981 Britain, for exam- ple, and criteria for living in social housing are quite different. Hence, although social hous- ing remains the preserve of the 'working classes', a relatively large and diverse group is in fact eligible to live there.41 Following Lees and Jacobs, I used a variety of methods to construct a sense of the Hundertwasser-Haus' symbolic, discursive, material and practical importance in Vienna and beyond. I was granted access to the Hundertwasser archive in Vienna, where I was able to access original versions of Hundertwasser's writings on architecture. I also accessed English- and German-language media coverage of the house itself (largely in the form of Viennese news- paper articles). Over a period of four weeks in September 2002 and February, 2003, 1 spent time in the pedestrianized street directly outside the house, and the dedicated indoor tourist 'shopping village' directly opposite the house. There, I was able to observe the diversity of tourists' activ- ities outside the house in some detail (tourists are not permitted to enter the house), and to con- verse briefly with them about their experience of the house. Finally, I interviewed eleven residents of the house in conversations lasting between 20 minutes and two hours. Our interviews42 covered many themes pertaining to their lives at the house, including their relationship with tourists, and their strategies for coping with the more unusual elements of the house's design. In this paper, I concentrate on material that specifically and pointedly exemplifies three diverse but ongoing constituents in the construction and negotiation of extraordinariness at the Hundertwasser-Haus. I intentionally reiterate key moments and combinations to highlight how the recursive repetition of similar discourses and practices (especially the everyday/ spectacular) plays a key role in multiple productions of extraordinariness at the house. First, I discuss par- ticularly pertinent elements of Hundertwasser's life and work; this is followed by an analysis of press coverage of the house in the printed media; finally, I focus upon the activities of tourists at the house. Throughout the following sections, I draw significantly upon interview material with residents to balance the views of those 'outside' the house with the experiences of those living 'inside'. This also enables me to demonstrate how extraordinariness is co- produced by changing assemblages of actors, texts and practices. 1 Friedensreich Hundertwasser: an extraordinary architect The irresponsible vandalism of the constructive, functional architects is well known. They simply wanted to tear down the beautiful stucco-façade houses of the 1890s and Art Nouveau and put up their own empty structures. Take Le Corbusier, who wanted to level Paris completely in order to erect his straight-line, monstrous construc- tions. Now, in the name of justice, the constructions of Mies van der Rohe, Neutra, the Bauhaus, Gropius, Johnson, Le Corbusier, Loos etc. should be torn down, as they have been outdated for a generation and have become morally unbearable.43 118</page><page sequence="9">Kraftl: Living in an artwork FIGURE 2 The Hundertwasser-Haus in comparison with its surroundings. Photo by author. Friedensreich Hundertwasser was born in Vienna in 1928 and died in 2000. He is perhaps best known as an artist, producing organic and colourful paintings which depict his passion for environmentalism. The 'primitivism' of Hundertwasser's paintings - which should be familiar to some human geographers and spatial theorists44 - betrays his admiration for Klimt, Schiele - and Klee.45 The spiralling forms of his primitivism have been related to Hundertwasser's dual identity - a child-like, regressive introspection combined with an extrovert and vehemently politicized public persona.46 Many commentators acknowledge the broader artistic trends of the 20th century upon Hundertwasser's entire oeuvre, including his architecture: Jugendstil and Seccesionstil - the Germanic attempt to come to terms with French Art Nouveau; con- nections to the surrealists, through Gaudi and other Modernist(a)s; the Vienna School of Fantastic Realism; and the Paris and Vienna art scenes of the 1950s onwards.47 From the late-1950s onwards, Hundertwasser dedicated increasing energy to a critique of Modern architecture.48 He was particularly concerned with the moral and medical effects of 119</page><page sequence="10">cultural geographies 16(1) functional, box-like buildings upon their inhabitants. He was similarly critical of the disjuncture between art, humanity and nature that he believed was manifest in Modern design philosophy. Although beginning rather modestly by painting over photographs of modern buildings to sym- bolically interrupt their 'rational' straight lines, Hundertwasser's architectural interventions became progressively more involved. The Hamburg Line (1959), drawn at the Lerchenfeld Art Institute by Hundertwasser and two poets (Bazon Brock and Harald Schult), was one of his first properly 'architectural' expressions. The line, drawn continuously over two days, ran spiral- ing around a room at the Institute. Intended to interrupt the smooth lines of Modern architec- ture, the spiral and the wavy line became emblematic of Hundertwasser's building designs. Hundertwasser's stinging (and high profile) attacks on Modern architecture were also orien- tated towards a particular re-imagination of an ecoloģcal architecture that would be symbolically attuned to the needs of an aestheticized 'nature' in addition to the haptic and visual require- ments of a building's residents. Other performances (some of which were televised in Austria) included his speeches Mould Manifesto' (1958), 'Speech in the Nude for the Right to a Third Skin' (1967) and 'Loose from Loos' (1968). 49 Herein, Hundertwasser began to outline his phil- osophy that individuals should be able to change their architectural surroundings as they wished: The architect should be subordinate to the occupant (tenant, owner, lodger) or at least to the occupant's wishes. All occupants must be free to create their 'outer skins' - they must be free to determine and transform the out- ward shell of their domicile facing the street.50 For him, this represented a radical departure from the hegemony of pre-set design and form to a more process-based aesthetics (and practice). From the 1960s onwards, Hundertwasser produced over 50 detailed models to demonstrate his vision for 'a more human architecture in harmony with nature'.51 Apart from the Hundertwasser-Haus, Hundertwasser realized roughly half of these projects, including the Rupertinum gallery in Salzburg, a Church and Thermal Pool Complex in Styria (Austria), a motorway service station in Lower Austria, the Spittelau district heating plant in Vienna, the KunstHausWienn near the Hundertwasser-Haus, a winery in California, a school in Frankfurt (Germany), and a public toilet in New Zealand. All of these projects have received considerable attention in their host countries; Hundertwasser is particularly well-known in Austria, Germany, the USA, New Zealand and Japan. During this time, through his speeches, television appearances and projects, Hundertwasser also succeeded in making a distinct name for himself. In 1977, Hundertwasser was asked by the City of Vienna to re-design a house on the cor- ner of Loewengasse and Kegelgasse in the 3. Bezirk (district) of Vienna. The city's Federal Chancellor provided Hundertwasser with an opportunity to demonstrate how a house built along 'aesthetic-creative' principles had 'the chance to combat sterile uniformity'.52 From the start, then, the difference that the house would engender in Vienna's architectural landscape was paramount. Hundertwasser described the house thus: So it is imperative that we must break with a whole series of regulations. These regulations . . . created at another time, under different conditions ... are now, in the light of new requirements... directed against the environment and man [sic.]. . . . Everyone will be glad to return home. For the house sparkles in the sunshine and in the moon- light. It has fountains, and you can sit amidst the trees. And you look at the living walls and recognÌ2e the living windows with pleasure, the ones you can reshape yourself, behind which you are at home.53 120</page><page sequence="11">Kraß/: Living in an artwork Hundertwasser is relatively explicit in stressing both the radical "break' that the house proposes (including with post-modernism) whilst and because it is more sensitively geared to people's need to be at home, to dwell amongst an aestheticized and pleasing nature. It is therefore this combination of the house as symbolically radical, ecological polemic, with its self- evident, vernacular, homely logic that renders the effect most powerful. It is important to highlight that it is from the (self-)presentation of Hundertwasser's own work as an extraordinary architect, that the house began to take on elements of extraordi- nariness. In fact, this occurred before a brick was laid on the corner of Kegelgasse and Loewengasse. Whether knowingly or not, through his speeches, television appearances and architectural interventions, Hundertwasser was in the process of producing a cult of himself. As Wieland Schmied points out: '[h]e wants to reveal himself to the world. He wants to be noticed'.54 As much for his artistic talent, then, it could be argued that Hundertwasser was commissioned by the city of Vienna for his personality. His personality would, associated with his strongly principled ecological and aesthetic ideology, provide an ideal springboard for launching Vienna onto the contemporary architectural map. As Restany comments: [s]ensitive as much to his painting as to his theoretical statements, the local councillors offered Hundertwasser the opportunity to realise his utopia. Political power was addressed to Hundertwasser because it was determined to take up the challenge concerning the power of art. [...] (T]he Vienna City Council did not turn to an architect but to a dealer in happiness, passing him an order for a complex of happy spaces.55 The furore surrounding Hundertwasser was brought to the fore by the Hundertwasser-Haus. The house itself was merely the symbolic and material capitulation of Hundertwasser's rise to fame. As 70,000 visitors and reporters queued up for an opportunity to see the house on its first open day in 1985, a simple sense of extraordinariness surrounding the building was already assured. If the house was an expression of Hundertwasser's Utopian vision, it had simultaneously become the climax of a tremendous amount of knowingly controversial work undertaken by Hundertwasser and his allies in the thirty years before-hand. Symbolically, the house continues to perform this work on Hundertwasser's behalf: the clear aesthetic differ- entiation of the building from those surrounding it is obvious (Figure 2). However, the con- struction of extraordinariness is culturally and politically far more complex than this initial narrative suggests. For it was (and is) in the continuous discursive and performative negoti- ation of the Hundertwasser-Haus by the press, tourists and inhabitants that it achieves an ongoing capacity to demand attention. 2 Critiquing the extraordinary, producing the extraordinary: press coverage of the Hundertwasser-Haus Hundertwasser's incendiary comments regarding Modern architecture ensured high levels of attention in the written media before, during and after the construction of the Hundertwasser- Haus. In this section, I explore press coverage of the house before turning to residents' inter- pretations of that coverage and their direct dealings with journalists. Austrian and German architectural critics (upon whose writings I focus in the main here56) responded to the Hundertwasser-Haus with a mixture of bemusement, satire, ridicule, anger 121</page><page sequence="12">cultural geographies 16(1) and disdain. Although the majority of their writings about the house has been negative, the effect thereof upon the popularity of the house amongst lay* visitors has been quite the reverse. Architectural critics and their texts have ensured the further popularization of the house as both an artwork, and as a rather extraordinary element of Vienna's cultural, touristic landscape. In this section, I explore a selection of these critiques, bearing in mind how the house is constructed as through a mixture of sensationalism and everyday normality. Even before the house was built, it began to receive press attention. Although the status of the house as a (kitsch) 'sensation' was already being articulated by some critics, others questioned the depth of the building's meaning, wondering to what extent its 'beautified façade' represented a significant departure from Modern design: An architecture-sensation has been planned, the eighth wonder of the world, so to speak. ... Has any artist in the whole world ever had the chance to build such a large and expensive monument?57 The 'Bio-Burg' [eco-casde] runs the risk of diminishing into just a completely normal housing project, with a beautified façade and a couple of trees on the roof.58 Significantly, however, after the Hundertwasser-Haus was opened, critics began to turn to this very meshing of sensation and normality, as the Black Box of architectural (especially aes- thetic) controversy was kept open. For them, this meshing provided the critical-aesthetic mater- ial with which to highlight the importance of Utopian fantasy (usually framed in a derisory sense59) to the house. Their critiques obtained an odd circular logic. They complained about the popularity of the house with the very tourists whose appearance their coverage had encour- aged, and whose visits to the house continuously intensify the attention that the house receives. At the beginning of the 1980s, Hundertwasser. . .was given the chance to realise his dreams. ... There now stands a Neuschwanstein60 for consumers ... No ecological design... so that the mad thing stays up, it needs an extra thick dose of concrete. ... It is not architecture but a provocation.61 It is an architectural wow-experience, for all the tourists who come to the 3rd district all year as pilgrims, to see how life can be otherwise.62 Living with the plants - art or utopia, absurdity or utopia? Hundertwasser's 'Eco-house' is nearly finished, is stir- ring emotions, and is above all - no eco-house.63 ...the younger generation passionately praises the building's defiance of postmodern ornamentation. ...But the [house] is a city-owned apartment building of fantastical shapes and delirious effects... the structure seems a delightful prank... and is a splashy addition to Vienna's staid third district. ...To recapture the magic, one need only turn left (or is it right?) and follow the undulating line to the weedy terrace and breathe the daffy fresh air blowing across the architectural scene.64 Now framed as a joint artwork and tourist experience, and whatever the origin of this ever- complexifying phenomenon, the house clearly makes a big impression, whether positive or negative, whether ecological or not, whether architecture or (most likely) provocation. Although this latter provocation is linked negatively by Santner and Khittl to the illusory utopianism of consumerism, it is the social impact of this phenomenon in which the Hundertwasser-Haus' real, more positive value is seen to lie. In the intimate relationship between Hundertwasser's life-art and his architectural practice is located an extraordinary capacity for an odd kind of success in the face of adversity: 122</page><page sequence="13">Kraftl: Living in an artwork He set about transforming the Hundertwasser-Haus to create a brighter and more harmonious environment for its inhabitants... . Controversial architect Friedensreich Hundertwasser has confounded his critics to become one of Austria's leading lights.65 The world of architecture has always boasted mavericks, who produce buildings utterly outside the reigning aes- thetic, barely complying with regulations, yet escaping ridicule or suppression through their childlike authenticity, embellishment and logic. ... From the outset, he ridiculed and rejected rationalist and functionalist architectural theory... [and] sought to create buildings that were giant versions of his own artworks. ... The result was an architectural anthropomorphism that never succeeded in transferring convincingly to full, built form. ... Hundertwasser was an artist who relied on attack and inspiration, and neither ever let him down.66 For a few years now, the tourist topography of Vienna has become more colourful. With the building in Loewengasse, the Viennese painter Friedensreich Hundertwasser has changed his paintings into three dimensions. Then the nearby KunstHausWien followed, and - opposite the house - the Kalke Village, a pilgrim's shop the size of an average shopping mall... . With their shrill colourfiilness...his buildings affect the body and make no effort to correspond with their architectural surroundings.67 Although greeted with a little reluctance, perhaps, it seems that Hundertwasser's earlier status as an 'extraordinary' architect was somehow - inexplicably - assured in the translation of his maverick designs to architectural forms. In an extraordinary sense, then, the house seems to be unerringly appropriate for its multiple functions, despite its aesthetic and symbolic disjuncture from surrounding buildings. The house's extraordinary status is rendered still more complex by the agency of its inhab- itants, who are keenly aware of its exposure in the media. As the quotation from Jean that began this paper suggested, residents have a keen sense of the contestable (social) function that the house plays. Rob: Yeah, well, it is really an artwork? Yeah, it's got kitsch elements... but I wouldn't be a preterite and say whether it's art or not... it's just how it's received, what is artistically rich, and insofar as that, it's an artwork (res- ident since 1986). Caroline. It [the house] is splendid, yeah? Actually it lives, it is alive, and it is so welcome, it is actually a State project, [almost] where the thought was, like in a museum, that it will hopefully be entertaining too. So it's liv- ing, and the tourists downstairs who look at it... that's normal, I'd do it (Female, 1986). PK: Why does it [the house] feel Viennese? Michael: Well, because it looks exciting - why it's Viennese . ..? Kater. Yeah, it's simply well marketed, well known, I mean, you see it on every postcard. . . Michael. Thus it is Viennese but it's, it's, not Viennese, so I would rather identify a Viennese element, that it's, the grand façade and very litde behind. It is... like, the Viennese attempt to shield themselves a bit. And with the more Modern style, yeah? The Viennese have always been very grey, in other words very used to their grey heart (Married couple, residents since 1986). As long-term residents of the city, these tenants had difficulty assessing the 'place' of the Hundertwasser-Haus in Vienna's urban landscape. The house seemed to occupy an unstable position: both 'Viennese', and not; perhaps an artwork, perhaps not. The key thing for most residents was that they felt the house had been 'marketed' in a forceful way, or that the 'house-as-social-housing' was merely one part of a larger 'State' project to entertain via archi- tecture. Ironically, being a social housing project, the house is not marketed as a tourist 123</page><page sequence="14">cultural geographies 16(1) attraction in any official sense,68 nor is it open to the public (like a museum). It appears in Viennese tour guides, postcards and posters, but all of these are geared either to the promo- tion of Vienna as a whole, or to providing mementos of the house once tourists have vis- ited. The point is, then, that as a result of the quantity and type of attention the house receives - in the active production of extraordinariness by the press-tourist inter-action - the pervading feeling of most residents is that the house is vigorously marketed. Beyond reading about the house, at least two residents had experienced direct dealings with journalists themselves. These meetings - characterized by their banality - resulted in markedly different encounters: PK Have you had much contact with the press? Anna. Yeah. There was more at one stage. At the beginning, there was always something. .. [journalists] taken on tours through the house. And then a report, in some fashion magazine, and so on. . . But I had a nasty expe- rience. What happened was - there was this woman, and she asked me questions about the house, perfectly nor- mally, but she simply had a closed opinion about the house. And she was really unpleasant, somehow she changed everything I said into something negative. And I had invited her in, with my baby here, and she was really unpleas- ant (resident since 1986). Daniella. Not many [journalists], but . . . sometimes with ORF,69 when they want to film? And I did, well house- work, looked after the children . . . sort of short films, and then I played with the children, and they filmed it. PK : What sort of programmes? Daniellď. That was for an evening programme, 'Kultur Heute' [ť Culture Today] or something, about the house (Female, 1999). It transpired that residents were figured by journalists as more-or-less passive 'actors' for their newspaper or television reports. In fact, since the visit of the unpleasant reporter, Anna had felt so angry and disillusioned that I was the first Visitor' to whom she had spoken about the house since that episode. Daniella was more ambivalent - and a little bemused - at the banality of the tasks the ORF reporters had filmed her doing. In her case, it seemed that the highlight of her appearance was (once again) to contrast the banal, material everydayness of the house with its sensationalized, aestheticized legend. Although concerned in the most part with their own lives and not the extraordinariness of the house, the residents are all too (critically) aware of both the house's place in the city, and their own relatively passive roles with regard to the formal representation of the house. They problematized the mediatised rep- resentation of the house-as-extraordinary for the expectations and limitations this image occa- sionally wrought upon their daily lives. However, when we explored the activities of tourists at the house it emerged that residents were far more powerful and active in the production of more complex and ephemeral forms of extraordinariness. 3 Experiencing the extraordinary: (informal) tourism at the Hundertwasser-Haus Since 70,000 people queued to visit the Hundertwasser-Haus on its first open day, it has attracted steady streams of visitors. Informally, as many residents told me, it is perceived to be the third most important tourist attraction in Vienna. However, as there seemed to be no 124</page><page sequence="15">Kraftl: Living in an artwork official count - and as most tourists ostensibly spend fifteen minutes staring at the outside of the house before going into the dedicated Hundertwasser shopping village opposite - it would be impossible to substantiate or deny this claim. I spent four weeks outside the house (in the cold) in February 2003: even at this time, during the day, the pedestrianized street outside the house was always busy with families and tour groups. In this section, drawing on interview material and excerpts from my field observation notebook, I explore the complex and partial role that tourists play in the production and negotiation of extraordinariness at the house. Most tourists followed a similar pattern of activity around the outside of the house: stop- ping to stand back and stare; taking photographs; walking around the landscaped pedestrian- ized area, with its Hundertwasser-style undulations and trees; pausing to look at (even photograph) the postcards outside one shop; and, finally, into the shopping village to browse the merchandise on offer. In terms of tourist behaviour, I could discern litde of interest: yet, as I observed such repetitive behaviour, I was constandy reminded that this was not (supposed to be) a tourist attraction - it was a house. In some senses, then, the very banality and un- assuming repetitiveness of tourists' activity was extraordinary. It is worth re-iterating the point that the house has recursively become a tourist attraction both as a function of its mediated exposure, and the presence of tourists outside, and the exposure of that presence in the media. Despite the extraordinariness of such banality (or vice-versa), specific moments outside the house caught my attention70. I am staring up at the side of the house with a group of tourists. Suddenly, a window opens above us, a man leans out and starts placing pots and pans on the outer windowsill. Along with the other tourists, I whip my cam- era out and start taking photographs. But why? A man walks across from the 'phone box and almost stumbles into me by one of the hills. He has walked from the 'phone box without looking up, peering into the lens of his video camera which is firmly pointed downwards, tracing the spiraling patterns of the cobbles. He is video-ing the pavement. Hardly anyone is outside at the moment, although it is now sunny. An English-speaking couple hang around for over twenty minutes, hugging ... I don't hear what they are saying, but they run up and down the hills, and she jumps off the top of one, into his arms. They are both laughing all the time... These small-scale events assumed a greater degree of significance for two reasons. First, I was reminded again of the ways in which the Hundertwasser-Haus was being produced as an extraordinary place via the intersection of the spectacular and the mundane. This was a house whose pavements were worth video-recording, and whose residents' pots and pans were worth photographing in the same frame as the house's façade. Here, the material banal- ities constitutive of home/house in Jacobs' analyses71 were being constandy scrambled, exceeded and co-opted into the co-production of extra-ordinariness at the Hundertwasser- Haus. Indeed, in addition to the hundreds of similar press images and television programmes, many thousands of images of the house and its residents were and are now circulating between friends and families in holiday mementos. Most residents consider this a rather amusing part of life at the house, and seem to be quite complicit in this form of representing the house: Martin: It is sometimes quite funny. I wake up in summer, open the curtains, and then Flash! Flash! Flash! ( gestures as if taking pictures , a big grin on his face) 125</page><page sequence="16">cultural geographies 16(1) PK : So it's like you're famous? Martin: A bit like the scene in [the film] Notting Hill, you know, when Julia Roberts opens the door, and [press pho- tographers stand outside taking photographs] ...? (resident since 1986). John: What I always find funny are the stories, they tell, there are these absurd stories. But iťs something that's always funny. And the other funny point are these household daily things, like when I shake the bed clothes out of the window, and then I'm on twenty photographs. But sometimes, it's really nice, if there are only a couple of people down there, we really like inviting people in to have a look around (resident since 1999). Second, and in addition to the more active and knowing role of residents in these infor- mal images of the house, it seemed that some tourists' reactions during their time at the house extended beyond that of a 'normal' tourist destination. The young couple hugging (above) demonstrate what for some commentators is the strongly emotional bond that cer- tain types of visitors feel for the house: The statements made by visitors72 . . . simply document how emotionally people react to this house.73 Alex :74 There must be something about this place. . .if you don't like a picture, you walk past it with your eyes shut If you don't like music, you turn it off. . . . But you always have to live with architecture. Hundertwasser knew that, [he] knew how you must feel well there. It's not psychological, or psychoanalytical, but psychosomatic It's usually women who come into my café. They tend to come here on their own, or drag their men in here. They are the ones who want to spend longer here, and leave comments in my guestbook. You can see the [Hundertwasser] house has an effect on them, they start hugging their boyfriends, some of them even start crying. But the men don't seem to notice. I would say it is a building for females. There is not space here to consider the gendered nature of reactions to the house,75 or its potentially gendered symbolism. The critical point is that reactions to the house vary from the short-term partial and repetitive, to the strongly emotional, engaged and longer- term. On the one hand, visitors who follow the short-term, repetitive paths taken by most tourists create one kind of extraordinariness (through their very presence, and their thou- sands of un-traceable photographs). On the other hand, those who are invited into the house by residents, or forge a deep emotional bond with the house, create more particu- lar instances of extraordinariness. They do so for themselves, undoubtedly, but also for those who observe and interact with them, and who are therein reminded of the almost magical, affective qualities of the house to create quite extraordinary effects. Once again, recursively, their actions affect and infuse other representations of the house (such as the description of the visitors' books, above); at the same time, those representations might initiate or constitute part of similar responses to the house by other tourists; those responses may also be deeply affected by Hundertwasser's own writings about architecture (of which many ťpilgrims' are very aware); whilst all three may be qualified by residents' everyday pot-and-pan-wielding escapades and other actions. And so on; the recursive, repeti- tive coproduction of the extra-ordinary geographies of the Hundertwasser-Haus is - for the moment - assured. Finally, it is crucial to consider tourists' impact upon residents, which has a significant bearing upon the ways in which they experience the Hundertwasser-Haus as their extra/ ordinary home. Three quotations illustrate the diversity of responses to tourists' activities: 126</page><page sequence="17">Kraftl: Living in an artwork Sarah. It's so wonderful. It's a lovely feeling when you come in here. And part of that is - I really like it that the tourists are down there, lots of people are really annoyed that there are so many tourists. But like I said, for example I always have the feeling that I'm constandy on holiday? There are Japanese, English, it's super! (resident since 1995). Jane: [Tourists broke in] over the washing room, through the window when we were airing it, then in front by the chil- dren's playroom - the playroom at the front is like a cage, like a zoo - and that's got something to do with the fact that Hundertwasser wanted the playroom as an exhibition room for his things - yeah? ...If Hundertwasser had really thought about people, then the playroom would have been properly inside the house, perhaps in the cellar. And the difficulty was, that when the children were playing down there, and when there were no curtains, the tourists, like in Schoenbrunn with the apes - knocked on the windows and frightened the children terribly. Yeah, my oldest child, they didn't go down to play. Or, tourists would try to tear the door out of your hand [to get in]. The children couldn't go in alone (resident since 1986). Elizabeth. Does tourism have an effect on my daily life? No, of course it doesn't (slight laugh over answer) (res- ident since 1986). It goes without saying, at this stage, that the types of interactions Sarah and Jane have experienced with tourists at the house are at the least odd (for a social housing block), and in the terms of this paper, approaching extraordinary. Jane - whose comments about the house began this paper - continues her ardent critique of the practical limitations of Hundertwasser's exhibitionist architecture (which, as she re-iterates, includes residents in that exhibitionism). On the other hand, whilst Elizabeth is ambivalent about tourists, Sarah is constandy affected by the repetitive nature of their actions in a far more positive way. Therefore, the extraordin- ary impact of the house upon its visitors reflects back onto the residents who - predictably - also help to constitute the uncanny overall effect of the house which has become homely in a rather odd way. One final quotation demonstrates the overall effect of the complex, recur- sive interactions of artwork- tourism-press-residents (etcetera). Echoing the reaction Alex described earlier, John articulates neady the other-worldly extraordinariness of the house as social houńng. Johrr. Well, for example, when I come home on Fridays, then I go into another world. It's like my casde [mein S eh loss]. And I probably wouldn't see that in another social housing block. I mean, the others [are] also practically furnished, and you've got distance heating, and warm water. You must feel it, here it's just like young love, right? You can only love this house. It was noticeable for at least one and a half years, and it's still like that really (resident since 1999). Ill Conclusion: extraordinary constructions or constructing the extraordinary? In opening out some of the manifold discourses, practices and materials constitutive of life at the Hundertwasser-Haus, this paper has demonstrated a diverse range of ways in which extra- ordinariness may be produced through an architectural space. In particular, I have sought to highlight the recursive and sometimes selective combination of both everyday and spectaculariņed practices and discourses. The deliberately multiple and repetitive nature of this analysis - lay- ering and co-implicating Hundertwasser's biography and beliefs, press attention, inhabitants' 127</page><page sequence="18">cultural geographies 16(1) experiences, and observations of tourists - demonstrates the multiple and repetitive ways in which the house's extra-ordinariness (as artwork, tourist attraction and social housing) has proceeded. In concluding, I do not wish to revisit recent debates which have already - and in my view satisfactorily - delineated the complex relationship between the everyday and the extraordinary.76 Suffice it to say that the coproduction and mutual involvement of the every- day/extraordinary at the Hundertwasser-Haus is in many ways illustrative of the conceptual dynamism of Gardiner's and Lefebvre's understandings of the irruption of Utopian (or oth- erwise exceptional) moments in the course of everyday life. Instead, I conclude with five reflec- tions upon the wider relevance of the Hundertwasser-Haus case study to cultural geographers and architectural theorists. I focus in particular upon the significance of 'extra-ordinariness' as a frame of reference for examining architectural geographies and histories. First, this paper adds a further case study to geographers' now long-standing engagement with the malls, World's Fairs, global events and monumental architectures which are deemed in large part to be some of the ultimate expressions of consumer capitalism. Running both against and from a flow of social-scientific inquiry concerning the geographies of the every- day, this paper has sought to re-emphasize the significance of the spectacular and extraordi- nary. In so doing - and in combining materials taken from interviews, observations, media analysis and archive material - it has expanded the methodological toolkit available for attend- ing to the complex work involved in producing the extra-ordinary. Through interviews with residents of the Hundertwasser-Haus (in stories as diverse as feeling at home, or bad experi- ences with journalists), the paper also demonstrated how extra-ordinariness matters to the peo- ple who experience it and produce it, if only temporarily. In my mind, these methodological and substantive concerns signal a need for renewed attention to the becoming-extra-ordinary of diverse places around the world. Second, and related, it is worth remembering that the Hundertwasser-Haus was intended as a counter- capitalist (or at least weakly ecological) statement, albeit following some of the trajec- tories and imageries associated with monumental expressions of consumer capitalism. Although not explicitly the concern of this paper, the Hundertwasser-Haus signals the increasingly impor- tant role played by (often media-tized) extra-ordinary places, people and practices in struggles within and against consumer capitalism. Amongst the nitty-gritty practices entailed in protest, activism or counter-cultural lifestyles, the figure of the extra-ordinary (a street party, a publicity stunt, an art installation) proffers one political tool among many. The extra-ordinary - whether or not understood via the 'architectural' frame of reference propounded in this paper - offers a key hook for understanding the production of knowingly different places and practices. Third, the Hundertwasser-Haus as a case study is very different from the many other spec- tacular sites explored by cultural theorists and historians. For, the Hundertwasser-Haus was not simply designed as a statement, or a monumental icon. Instead, however one reads Hundertwasser's intentions, its primary function was of a social housing block, housing some of Vienna's thousands of social housing beneficiaries. The multiple, intermingling 'lives' of the Hundertwasser-Haus are part of its unique attractiveness. Yet the Hundertwasser-Haus is not unique in combining an ostensibly domestic building with other functions or imaginaries. Many other buildings and artefacts hold a similar combination of the domestic and/or ordinary with the somehow spectacular - from Gaudi's apartment blocks in Barcelona to National Trust-owned properties in the UK, and from the ruins of ancient settlements 128</page><page sequence="19">Kraft/: Living in an artwork to a unique prehistoric hand tool. It is precisely this combination of ordinary and spectacu- lar (however either of these is formulated, with whatever level of impact) which sends a shiver of twisted recognition, of uncanny resemblance, even of unsettling euphoria. As Steven Pile and others have pointed out, the irruption of the unknown within the known - the procession of the uncanny, or of the extraordinary - may produced a deeply affecting, perhaps Utopian mix of fear and desire.77 In my reading, the Hundertwasser-Haus would be one of many more or less mutable buildings, places, objects - even experiences - which pro- duces this extra-ordinary scrambling of the domestic everyday with something other. Beyond their touristic import, the house and other buildings like it are thus crucially important places for understanding and questioning the familiar.78 Fourth, the case of the Hundertwasser-Haus reminds us that as much as architectural forms like 'home' are the more-or-less immutable products of socio-technical systems (as per Jane Jacobs' suggestion), the figuring of a building as a home may, in some circumstances (as those in the previous point) not be the end of things. It would be a truism to state that almost all buildings resembling homes are not merely homes. Yet, in the case of the Hundertwasser-Haus, the building is laid out for all to see as more-than a home. The 'fact' of home is in turn entrained in further networks of discourses, materials and practices (around art and tourism) which entail their own socio-technical systems, and of which the Hundertwasser-Haus is merely a constituent part. Yet - lest we stray into the role of the Hundertwasser-Haus within Vienna's tourist economy, or the art world - the point holds that in this obvious (read media-tized, well-visited, 'famous') going-beyond the usual, the Hundertwasser-Haus obtains its own peculiar brand of extra-ordinariness. The extra-ordinary geographies of buildings like the Hundertwasser-Haus proceed through not only their con- stitution by socio-technical networks, but their very notable situation within multiple networks: ironically, perhaps, it is this multiple situatedness in what are more commonly termed Every- day' networks which is what, above all, sets those buildings apart. Fifth, and in closing, I would offer a point which perhaps runs against the grain of con- temporary avant-garde work in cultural geography specifically (including my own). Despite the affective impact of the Hundertwasser-Haus upon its tourists and residents, and the sig- nificance of diverse, banal everyday practices to the production of extra-ordinariness at the site itself, one must return to the representational practices at play at the Hundertwasser-Haus to fully understand its widespread fame. So, as much as both Lees and Jacobs allow for rep- resentational strategies involved in policy-making, media debate and architectural design in their case studies, I close this paper by more explicidy urging architectural geographers (and architectural theorists more generally) not to ignore the representational devices which may be key to the buildings or forms they study. It may be out of the fashion of nonrepresen- tational thinking79 to say this, but for the Hundertwasser-Haus to obtain its extra-ordinary fame, a massive array of newspaper articles, architectural plans, postcards and speeches has been circulated. And it is not merely the quantity or presence but the content of these repre- sentations - the controversies, mixing of familiar and unfamiliar, of home and artwork - which has more often than not dictated the status of the Hundertwasser-Haus, whatever the importance of the daily practices of inhabitation and tourism which are embroiled with them. Like utopias, those places where the ongoing socio-spatial construction of extraordinariness occurs, offer critical sites at which to reflect upon and otherwise qualify the homes, tourist 129</page><page sequence="20">cultural geographies 16(1) attractions and artworks we take for granted. Greater critical attention to the ongoing, every- day production of extraordinariness is not merely significant in the conceptual terms of a deconstruction of everdayness vis-à-vis extraordinariness. Extraordinariness matters in many and diverse ways to everyday life - as demonstrated by the various concerns of residents at the Hundertwasser-Haus. Extraordinary places do not merely warrant our attention: they demand it.

In 2003, a legal process over the creative ownership of the house was in process. It was argued that Josef Krawina, the original architect assigned to work with Hundertwasser, should be recognized in the name of the house. Although this case was upheld, at the time of my research, the building was known as the Hundertwasser-Haus, so I use this terminology for simplicity. 2 Quotation from interview with respondent.

The maximum income limits for eligibility are as follows for 2004: for a one person household, 25,000 Euros/year (£17,000); for a four person household, 48,000 Euros/year (£33,000). Rent in the house varies by size of apartment. However, the standard Viennese rates are €2,08 per square metre per week for a category 'B' (large- to medium-sized) flat, which works out at around €50 per week.

Schmied points out that Hundertwasser's upbringing as the son of a Jewish mother, in 1930s Vienna, may explain his introversion. 47 Restany, The power of art'; for a full collection of Hundertwasser's work, see W. Schmied and A. Fuerst, Hundertwasser's complete works: collector's edition (Koeln, Taschen, 2003); for critical essays on Hundertwasser's life and his architectural practice, see R. Schediwy, Hundertwassers Haeuser : Dokumente einer Kontroverse ueber ņitgemaesse Architektur (Wien, Edition Tusch, 1999). 48 The precise aesthetic, technological and social definitions of architecture were and are contested: see K. Frampton, Modern architecture : a critical history (London, Thames &amp; Hudson, 2000). However, it is clear that Hundertwasser was especially critical of Adolf Loos' attack on ornamentation, of the straight line, and of box-like, 'system-built' housing blocks such as the many social housing flats that are scattered nearby the Hundertwasser-Haus, and which were built between 1930 and 1960. 49 These speeches are re-printed in Hundertwasser, 'Hundertwasser architecture'. 50 Ibid., p. 49. 51 Ibid. 52 B.

However, many Utopian theorists argue that this representation is grossly unfair, and in fact masks an implicit, 'logical' utopi- anism which justifies (amongst other things), the 'war on terror' begun by the USA and its allies following the attacks in New York and Washington on 11 September 2001.
