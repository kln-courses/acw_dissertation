The longer lists of important variant readings he pushes to the rear of the volume, immediately following the explan- atory notes, and facilitates reference to both appendices by marginal line numbering of his text. Prefacing the notes for each novel is a brief dis- cussion of the bases for settling on the particular text and a list of the later seventeenth-century and modern reprints available. To understand the full sweep of Professor Lawlis's study ofDeloney's prose fiction, the scholar must consult his companion monograph Apol- ogyfor the Middle Class (Indiana University Press, I960). The rich find- ings of his literary study give substance to the explanatory notes of this edition and form the basis for the knowledgeable critical introduction. This introduction, the author explains, was written after the mono- graph and contains some material not heretofore set forth: the recogni- tion of Deloney as an early historical novelist, Deloney's probable use of Proverbs xxxI as the ideal for the characterization of the middle-class Elizabethan wife, and a reassessment of the facts known about Deloney's life. TEMPLE UNIVERSITY C. William Miller John Peter. A Critique of Paradise Lost. New York: Columbia Univer- sity Press, 1960. ix+I72 pp. $3.50. Mr. Peter professes to examine the characters, action, and ideas of Paradise Lost as an objective critic attending to what actually seems present in the lines. His eight chapters challenge Milton's presentation of the supernatural beings, the war in Heaven, Adam and Eve, the fall and its consequences. His conclusions are as spectacular as his method, and as preposterous. He finds God and his angels aesthetic and social fail- ures, Christ and Michael almost accidental successes, and Satan the vic- tim of malicious and gratuitous abuse. As for the human principals, Eve's inclination to work separately is regarded a commendable prac- ticality for which she has been unjustly censured; her conduct in tempta- tion is defended and somehow to Milton's personal discredit. Adam's fall, 'far from seeming a defection, must strike us as a necessary and courageous action' (p. 131) to be condemned only by a reader sub- missive to 'inhumanity or rigid preconceptions' (p. 13 I). Nearly every- thing touched is inspected with devoted hostility, and no objection is too small or irrelevant to be brought against Milton's art and his attitude. [200 ]</page><page sequence="2">We are warned against substituting Milton's intention for his perform- ance, but many of the critical strictures are supported by discrepancies between the supposed effect and the critic's wayward inference of in- tention. The prevailing tone of the book is one of aggressive and ex- travagant dissatisfaction, not only with the poem but with Christianity as Mr. Peter conceives it. No student repines at informed adverse criticism of Paradise Lost for what it is, a late Renaissance Christian epic. In the past thirty years Milton has endured both reformed antagonists like Knight and Eliot, and unreformed like Cecil and Leavis; their attacks have enlivened Mil- ton studies even when in error because they bore some relation to sound scholarship and genuine critical responsibility. The appalling feature of this Critique is not merely that Mr. Peter denies Milton his donnee, which is Christianity and the Christian tradition, but also that he is him- self apparently unaware of the first principles of that theology and its theodicy. The question is not whether a modern reader can or should subscribe to Milton's form of Christianity, but what its doctrines are and how they enter the poem. Mr. Peter excludes or disregards or rep- resents imperfectly such complex seventeenth-century assumptions as those involving felix culpa, the theories of grace, of permitted evil, of foreknowledge and foreordination, and the privacy of God's motives in theJudaeo-Christian legacy. In view of the many allusions by Mr. Peter to the theological situation, such naivete seems incredible. Yet how else is one to explain the query: 'Wrath is one of the Seven Deadly Sins; ought God to be endowed with an infirmity he has forbidden man:' (p. 12). Or the complaint that God does nothing to hinder Satan's attack on Adam and Eve (p. I8)? Or the conclusion 'sometimes we suspect him [Raphael] of "editing" his tale so as to make it more admonitory' (p. 28) This substitution of the critic's attitude for what is actually present in the lines belies Mr. Peter's announced intention and points up his flab- bergasting treatment of epic characterization. Sometimes he proceeds as if the persons in the poem got away from Milton and invented their own speeches and sometimes as if he expects them to conform to the demands of psychological and narrative realism made by modern fic- tion and drama. In effect, he disapproves of characters on selective moral and ethical grounds for acting and speaking as the poet determined. To say that as the Son speaks 'God's silence takes on an air of brooding [ 20I ]</page><page sequence="3">petulance' (p. 12) is simply indefensible as serious criticism. It is invent- ing lines, not reading between them. God is silent because the Son is speaking, that's all. To complain that 'the speed of Abdiel's first blow is so emphasized as to suggest that he struck unfairly' (p. 76) is to assume some obligation of Milton to treat evil impartially, or at least submit dubious cases to a board of arbitration. The literary fact is that Milton regarded Satan as evil and God as good. He is guilty of neither moral relativism nor artistic incompetence when he depicts Satan as not hav- ing lost all his original brightness. Furthermore, the persons of the poem are not only compounds or composites, as Mr. Peter seems to recog- nize. They exist on several planes at once. Adam, for example, is a his- torical character formed out of the Biblical story, hexameral commen- tary, and imaginative literature, as well as an epic character broadly sketched, not a dramatic character whose thoughts and actions must be consistent with the principles of modern theatrical representation. Adam is also a religious and theological position defined and modified by cen- turies of exegesis and argument and a figure in a narrative, the implica- tions and symbolic extensions of which are rooted in Christian dogma. Sometimes one level is emphasized, sometimes another. So with God and the Son, whose very order of existence in the poem differs from man's, just as divine or cosmic time and space differ from earthly. The criteria invoked in this book are those of a sentimental existen- tialist whose values are committed to the relations of human beings to each other, instead of to each other and their Creator; and whose criti- cism limits them and their Creator to a single moral and social standard. In this construction, apparently, God is not only anthropomorphic; he must act like a man too and bejudged by standards derived from man's imperfect behavior. The critical method is that of a fluent but unin- formed school debater, violently enforcing what case he can by the most reckless interpretation of evidence. One infers that Milton chose unwisely to write a complex epic-rendering of the central Christian tradition and not to anticipate the modes of a twentieth-century natu- ralistic novel existing on a single level. If one is to judge other mythic poetry by the criteria of psychological and narrative realism sternly ap- plied to Milton's angels and deities, he must disallow the story of Atlas because it is illogical to suppose that any giant able to hold up the sky would be accessible to human sight. A further disabling feature of this critique is the author's failure or [202]</page><page sequence="4">refusal to assimilate the literature of his subject, an omission which per- haps accounts for some of the howlers already noted. To be sure, Lewis and Hanford and Hughes are cited, and there are pot shots at Williams, Stein, Bush, and one or two others. Yet many of the particulars dis- paraged here have already been canvassed by authors unknown to Mr. Peter or ignored. To mention only a few, one might recommend Gil- bert on the narrative inconsistencies of the poem, Whaler and Lerner on the similes, Wimsatt and Beardsley on the intentional fallacy, Schultz on the temptation, McColley on the time-scheme, Bush on the term enancel'd (p. 87), and the Nelv E1iglish Dictionary (to which one reference is made) on the seventeenth-century senses of Heaven (p. 85), sublime (p. SI), and contdescention (p. 27). Nearly every page produces errors which a thorough grounding in the commentary might have avoided. Raphael's discourse on cosmology in Book viii is perfectly lucid to any- one who has taken the trouble to recover its vocabulary; and Raphael does not conclude it by 'throwing up the subject with a moral rider to hide his bewilderment and ineffectuality' (p. 28). Similarly, in the ele- vation of the Son, God is not 'deliberately seeking to precipitate a re- bellion by rudely challenging their [the angels'] legitimate self-esteem' (p. 67). In the Christian view and in Milton's presentation, He is testing their obedience. Milton's claim that the Son's condemnation of the ser- pent was justified is scarcely 'astounding' (p. 114) to one who recog- nizes that the serpent is matter perverted by evil and therefore willy- nilly evil. The serpent is not an angel or a man with a divine soul; and only misplaced sentimentalism could describe as 'grossly unfair' the sentence passed upon 'the serpent for the deeds which it performs un- wittingly' (p. II5). Enough has been exhibited to indicate that the book is at best a wrong-headed and irresponsible reading of the poem and at worst a kind of film scenario based on Paradise Lost. So little is left of the epic after these omissions, mistakes, and judgments of Zoilus that a prospec- tive reader may wonder why Mr. Peter took the trouble. The preface explains. In the most extraordinary declaration since Bentley, he recog- nizes a special debt to A. J. A. Waldock's Paradise Lost and Its Critics, which seems to him 'second only to the text itself for a true understand- ing of the critical problems posed by the poem.' With this example to admire, and uninstructed by its reception, Mr. Peter has been moved to write a book against Paradise Lost, not about it.
