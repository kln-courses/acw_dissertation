<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Paintings in the Zhwa lu sGo gsum lha khang and bSe sgo ma lha khang: Stylistic Differences Franco Ricca &amp; Lionel Fournier Historical Premises Despite the dilapidated state of its structure, partially remedied after 1985 by several campaigns of restoration work, the monastery of Zhwa lu survived the looting and the destruction of the Cultural Revolution, which nevertheless led to the loss of its large statues and to the scattering of its precious books. The monastery appears as a neat unit, its compactness enhanced by the encircling wall girding it closely on all sides. The Chinese styled roofs of the highest pavilions endowed Zhwa lu with its unmistakable appearance, contributing with their regular orientation, constant elevation and uniform style to give the building complex a unity of character. The actual articulated layout of the monastery in various temples, chapels and residences is disguised by the orderly arrangement of these buildings around the nucleus represented by the 'du khang (assembly hall) in a particularly organic complex, such as was rarely the case in monasteries of that period. The history of Zhwa lu is tied to that of the ICe family, which claimed a super- natural origin and included among its ancestors the minister ICe Ye shes dngos grub who, having set himself to ensure the coming to Tibet of Guru Rin po che, had been rewarded by king Khri srong Ide btsan with the region known as Nyang ro,1 in southern-central Tibet. Thus, since very early times the ICe clan had owned the ter- ritory in which the temple of Zhwa lu would be erected. With the downfall of the Tibetan empire, the vicissitudes of this clan became mingled with the structural-political changes of the country and with the complex transforma- tions Buddhist institutions went through as a result of the persecution started by Glang dar ma. During the crisis that followed Glang dar ma's death (842) the ICe clan, like other aristocratic families, had also achieved a virtual independence within its own territory.2 The history of the Zhwa lu monastery borne out of a tragic outcome of an upheaval that almost totally exterminated the family of ICe g.Yu 'bum, the chief of one branch of the clan. Barely aged six, his son ICe btsun Shes rab 'byung gnas, born in 997, was forced to flee and seek refuge with Lo ston rDo rje dbang phyug (one of the dbus gtsang mi bcu' who took him as disciple. ICe btsun Shes rab 'byung gnas became his main assistant in the construction of the temple at rGyan gong and, in 1 026, he ob- tained his full ordination. In 1027 he founded Zhwa lu,3 building the two western chapels (lHa khang lho ma and lHa khang byang ma) and the eastern unit which included the sgo khang and the Yum chen mo lha khang above it. Towards the end of the 1030s, eager to receive a "more perfect" ordination, he temporarily entrusted the duties of the abbotship to mGo ba Ye shes g.yung drung, who had been his teacher along with Lo ston rDo rje dbang phyug, and travelled to India where he studied the</page><page sequence="2">1 04 THE TIBET JOURNAL Vinaya and received many other teachings from the ãcãrya of Bodhgaya, Abhayä- karagupta. During his return trip to Tibet, he won for his monastery the patronage of the king of Nepal, which implied the direct presence of Newar artists and craftsmen at Zhwa lu. ICe btsun Shes rab 'byung gnas is portrayed on a wall mural in the sGo gsum lha khang (Fig. 1). Upon his death, the date of which is unknown, the Abbatial See of Zhwa lu first went to his younger brother ICe btsun Shes rab ye shes and then to his step-brother g.Yu thog sGra gser bzang. The latter renounced his religious vows in order to establish a descendency of lay regents at Zhwa lu ensuring the family a conti- nuity of power. From then on two distinct lineages co-existed at Zhwa lu: one for the lay regents (dpon po) of the region, the other for the abbots (mkhan pó) of the monas- tery. g.Yu thog sGra gser bzang's successors in lay power were in chronological sequence ICe 'Bum pa, ICe A mes 'Bum 'dar, A mes 'Bum bstan, A mes chen po Sangs rgyas ye shes. The good relations of the ICe clan with the powerful 'Khon family had existed ever since the lords of Zhwa lu had patronized the foundation of the monastery of Sa skya in 1073 and were further strengthened by important matrimonial links. When A mes Sangs rgyas ye shes gave his daughter mKha' 'gro 'bum in marriage to 'Gro mgon Phyag na rdo ije (nephew of Sa skya Paņdita and brother of Phags pa) he received the title of sku zhang4 (respected uncle) which was subsequently kept by his successors replacing the old title a mes (forefather) in the lineage. The permanent alliance with Sa skya made the ICe family even more powerful, thus benefiting from the yon mchocf relationship established between the Sa skya pas and the Mongol court. In this new situation the lords of Zhwa lu, who had introduced the Mongol law in their dominions, became feudal lords of the Mongol emperor as khri spon (regents of a myriarchy) and at the same time subjects of the lords of Sa skya, the spiritual and temporal regents of Tibet. Upon sKu zhang Sangs rgyas ye shes's death, his first-born son sKu zhang rNga sgra received the decree and patent through which, by order of the emperor Se chen rgyal po (Qubilai Khan), he was entrusted with the rule of the Zhwa lu myriarchy and its religious communities. In 1290 the rule was transferred to his second son sKu zhang mGon po dpal whose titles were confirmed in the same year by a decree of the ti shih (Imperial Preceptor) Ye shes rin chen. A second confirmation came in 1296 with a decree issued by the new Imperial Preceptor Grags pa 'od zer, on behalf of the emperor Temiir Öljetü,6 and a new matrimonial link further reinforced his good rela- tions with Sa skya.7 mGon po dpal built the chapel called sGo gsum lha khang in the north wing of the temple, in which he had a Buddha statue with throne and halo erected, dedicated to his father. mGon po dpal was succeeded by his son rDo ije dbang phyug, who received the decree and appointment patent on the myriarchy of Zhwa lu and reigned for three years, probably in the period 1303-1305.8 rDo ije dbang phyug was succeeded in 1306 by sNga sgra's son, Grags pa rgyal mtshan, the greatest of the Zhwa lu sku zhangs. He travelled to China and received directly from the emperor Temür Öljetü the edict and</page><page sequence="3">THE PAINTINGS IN THE ZHWA LU. . . 105 patent, which made him lord of the lay and religious communities of the Zhwa lu myriarchy along with all the offices and dignities that had belonged to his father. The emperor was particularly benevolent with him, conferring on him the title gu shih (Im- perial Counsellor), entrusting him with the double role of commander in chief of the region (du dben sha ) and of judge of the three chol khas.9 He also gave him substantial funds for the renovation and expansion of the monastery. After his return from China, Grags pa rgyal mtshan further consolidated his political position by establishing new matrimonial links with both the Sa skya pas and the Tshal pas, launched important activities of reconstruction and refurbishment of the Zhwa lu temple, and in 1320 called the Dharmasvāmin Bu ston Rin po che to the Abbatial See.10 In 1333 he was succeeded as sku zhang by his son Kun dga' don grub, to whom the authority on the myriarchy of Zhwa lu was promptly confirmed by imperial decree and to whom all the titles and offices that had belonged to his father were trans- ferred. Kun dga' don grub found the means necessary for decorating the walls of the four pavilions built on the upper storey, and Bu ston laid down the scheme and provided the necessary explanations for the mandala to be painted inside. In 1335 the volumes of the bsTan 'gyur edition prepared by Bu ston were placed in the east- ern pavilion (bsTan 'gyur lha khang) with a great ceremony. Kun dga' don grub's successor, Ye shes kun dga', went on to restore the dilapidated paintings, decorated the external galleries with new paintings and built the large cloister, thus virtually terminating the reconstruction phase of the Zhwa lu monastery.11 The Monastery Structure The present structure of Zhwa lu is shown in the plan of Fig.2, which refers to the ground floor.12 The eastern half of the area covered by the monastery consists of a large courtyard enclosed by an open porch behind which the small living quarters of the monks are arranged along the two sides. Between this cloister and the temple com- plex is a projection of the monastery (eastern dbu rise or glo ' bur ), a square-plan block originally intended as a communication between the two parts (sgo khang) and later turned into a chapel dedicated to the wrathful protector gods of the temple ( mgon khang). On top of this hall or vestibule is the chapel dedicated to Prajnāpāramitā (Yum chen mo lha khang). A massive wall made of stone at least as far up as the first storey encircles this pro- jecting part on three sides, forming at the front a wide corridor perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the monastery and continuing on the two sides to embrace the rest of the complex and forming the great skor lam's outer wall. Encircled by this skor lam , on the west side of the ' du khang are the two chapels built by ICe btsun Shes rab 'byung gnas and, on its north and south sides respectively, the two chapels known as sGo gsum lha khang and bSe sgo ma lha khang which are the object of the present study. At the four comers of the building are four smaller rooms, mainly used for stor- age. On the upper floor are the four pavilions with the Chinese-style roofs. Three of these are aligned with the ground-floor chapels: the gNas brtan lha khang to the south,</page><page sequence="4">1 06 THE TIBET JOURNAL the Nang po'i bDe ldan lha khang to the west, the Tshe dpag med lha khang to the north; the fourth pavilion, the bsTan 'gyur lha khang, is situated to the east, above the Yum chen mo lha khang.13 Referring to the plan of Fig.2 and bearing in mind the historical outline drawn above, we can distinguish in the construction of Zhwa lu the following main phases: 1) foundation of the monastery in 1027 by ICe btsun Shes rab 'byung gnas (997-?) with the erection of the two west chapels (lHa khang lho ma and lHa khang byang ma), of the sgo khang and of the Yum chen mo lha khang; 2) construction of the north chapel (sGo gsum lha khang) by mGon po dpal (sku zhang of Žhwa lu from 1290 to 1303); 3) construction of the south chapel (bSe sgo ma lha khang) at an unknown date in the period between the rule of mGon po dpal and the initial phase of Grags pa rgyal mtshan's rule; 4) great renovation of the monastery by Grags pa gyal mtshan (sku zhang from 1 306 to 1333) which resulted in the creation of the present 'du khang and the decoration of the south chapel, the erection of the encircling wall with the crea- tion of the big skor lam on the ground floor, construction and decoration of the skor lam on the intermediate floor around the Yum chen mo lha khang, creation of the top-floor pavilions meant to illustrate the mandala, s of the yogatantra and to house the bsTan 'gyur edited by Bu ston; 5) completion of the roof covers and creation of the inner wall paintings of the new pavilions by Kun dga' don grub (sku zhang from 1333 to 1355). The partially dark area in this scheme is the one relative to the construction and decoration of the sGo gsum lha khang and bSe sgo ma lha khang, for the sources are not exhaustive in this respect, which forces us to turn our attention to the structural and stylistic aspects that can best complement them The Bu ston rnam thar 14 while listing the content of the various chapels forming the Zhwa lu gtsug lag khang, refers to them only with two brief remarks: byang gi gtso bo la thub pa chen po (the main cult object to the north is Mahāmuni) and lho gtso bo la dus gsum sangs rgyas (the main statues to the south are the Buddhas of the Three Times). The Myang chung more explicitly states that the sGo gsum lha khang was built by mGon po dpal, who succeeded rNga sgra as dpon of Zhwa lu, and fürther indi- cates that a statue of Mahāmuni, with throne, halo, and various decorations, was dedicated to his father A mes chen po Sangs rgyas ye shes; it then goes on to say that a Prajnāpāramitā was written for this chapel in the three redactions, long, medium and short (gsung rab rgyas ' brin bsdus mams bzhengs so).X5 Concerning the second chapel, the Myang chung , describing the work of Grags pa rgyal mtshan, states: "of this temple of Zhwa lu he made the south extension called bSe sgo ma and, in the east sgo khang , the mgon khang"16 When listing the content of the chapels it then adds: khyad par bSe sgo ma na dus gsum sangs rgyas dang/gser las bzhengs pa 'i bKa ' 'gyur brgyad ston brgya rìsa brgyad (in particular in the bSe sgo ma lha khang are the Buddhas of the Three Times, one bKa' 'gyur written in gold letters and 108 copies of the Asfasãhasrikã Prajnāpāramitā ).17</page><page sequence="5">THE PAINTINGS IN THE ZHWA LU. . . 107 Although the description of the north chapel in the Myang chung matches with that of the Zhwa lu dgon gyi lo rgyusx% and also, apart from the mention of the Prajnāpāra- mitã , with that of the "Genealogies of Zhwa lu" in Tucci's translation,19 the same cannot be said of the south chapel. The Zhwa lu dgon gyi lo rgyus , referring to the work of Grags pa rgyal mtshan, says:20 glo ' bur lho ma 7 gser sgo mar dus gsum sangs rgyas kyi gser sku dang/ 'dzam bu chu gser gyis bris pa 7 bka ' 'gyur dang brgyad stong pa brgya rtsa brgyad rams bzhengs (he made for the gSer sgo ma21 of the south wing the gilded statues of the Buddhas of the Three Times, one bKa' 'gyur written with the gold of the Jāmbū river, and 108 copies of the Asíasãhasrikã). From the "Genealogies of Zhwa lu" Tucci trans- lates : "Later he made the leather door on the Southern wing... and particularly on the leather door 108 Buddhas of the three times."23 From these two texts it would thus ap- pear that Grags pa rgyal mtshan was not so much involved in the construction of the chapel, but rather in the provision of the door lining (with leather or gold sheet), of the paintings, statues, and holy texts for an existing chapel, possibly left incomplete during the short rule of the sku zhang rDo ije dbang phyug (1303-1305). As far as we can gather from the architectural-structural evidence, we must observe that the two chapels are not perfectly symmetrical (as could appear from simplified plans published in the past) and that their present perfect integration in the monastic building complex is the result of a conscious harmonization and normalization plan. The sGo gsum lha khang is in fact larger than the bSe sgo ma lha khang (it has four pillars instead of two) and its greater width implied that the distance between the pillars and the 'du khang north wall is smaller than the module adopted for the inter- columnar space and also smaller than the distance between the pillars and the south wall. On the other hand its greater length did not allow the front wall of the gtsang lha khang (the shrine constituted by the two western chapels) to directly blend into the side wall also on the north side, as it was possible in the case of the bSe sgo ma lha khang. The structural differences between the two chapels support the idea of different times of construction, even if the construction of the bSe sgo ma lha khang was pro- bably earlier than the more general refurbishment carried out by Grags pa rgyal mtshan, in the course of which its decoration and the provision of statues and holy books took place. Whilst the agreement of the sources quoted suggests that the construction of the sGo gsum lha khang was most likely set in the last decade of the 13th century (mGon po dpal reigned from 1290 to probably 1303), it is possible that the bSe sgo ma lha khang was built by the sku zhang rDo ije dbang phyug and that the short duration of his government was the cause of its unfinished state, then brought to completion by Grags pa rgyal mtshan. Supporting this hypothesis are both similarities and differences in the dimensions and structural aspects of the two chapels (for instance the similarities and the differences in the entrance doors) and the considerable stylistic changes that can be detected in the paintings inside. The Wooden Structures in the Two Chapels The three doors opening on the north side of the 'du khang which lend their name to the sGo gsum lha khang (Fig.3) have a special symbolic significance in Buddhist</page><page sequence="6">108 THE TIBET JOURNAL thought, as a visible representation of the 'Three Doors to Liberation" (rnam tharsgo gsum): realization of the insubstantial nature of all things, renunciation of dis- criminating conceptual knowledge, and extinction of all desire. The double wings of each door, provided with large iron bosses, hinge on sturdy wooden jambs placed one next to the other and framed by a large tripartite structure surmounted by a single long lintel. The lintel is composite, with two rows of transverse blocks separating a double series of wooden plates (two series of three on each door). The panels in the lower series are carved and gilded with Buddhist symbols, heraldic animals, mythical beings of various sorts and an exuberance of feathers and vegetal scrolls (Figs.4a and 4b). On the wall above the doors traces of painting reveal ranks of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas probably dating from the foundation of the chapel. On the inner side of this front wall a large shelf is closely integrated with the structure of the three doors and still holds a large number of books (Fig.5). The door which from the south side of the 'du khang gives access to the bSe sgo ma lha khang has a similar structure: the same square framing with sturdy posts preserving the cylindrical shape of the trees from which they were cut, die same set of rectangular frames gradually sticking out towards the outside, the same twin lintel resting on two rows of square-section orthogonal blocks which separate a double series of carved panels (Fig.6). The two doors also reveal identical surfaces, strengthened (or decorated) by the same triple row of large iron bosses (three rows of three bosses on each door leaf). This similarity between the two chapels' doors obviously supports the idea that they were both built within a very short time span.24 It thus remains unclear how the embossed and painted leather door mentioned in the texts (from which the chapel would derive the name bSe sgo ma lha khang) could have been added by Grags pa Shes rab rgyal mtshan, since no trace remains of it. It seems likely that it may have been a leather curtain hanging from the upper beam, not unlike the heavy iron chain mail that can be seen today.25 Figures 7a and 7b show the carvings which, as in the entrance doors of the sGo gsum lha khang, decorated the blocks and the panels attached to the lintel, but reveal a less vigorous élan in the curvilinear motifs and a shallower carving, pointing to a different artisan and possibly also a partially different period for their execution.26 The symbols and motifs are similar to those of the wooden covers of the big bKa ' 'gyur volumes that were kept in this chapel, and which gave it the alternative name of bKa' 'gyur lha khang.27 Among them are the triratna , the Buddha Sâkyamuni preaching the Doctrine upon a lotus flower, the lion whose mighty roar is the standard metaphor for the Buddha's voice ( simhanãda ), the precious vase from which the dharmacakra emerges and the waves of his immortal teachings gush out.28 Clear traces remain of the gilding which made these carvings shiny, and of the vermilion background on which they stood out, giving the complex of these doors the superb appearance of a gilded frame through which one could access the precious texts and images contained in the chapel. Placed against the two lateral walls are two large wooden structures with five shelves meant to hold the volumes of the Buddhist Canon (Figs.8a and 8b). These structures differ from the usual ones in Tibetan monasteries in their higher quality (uprights</page><page sequence="7">THE PAINTINGS IN THE ZHWA LU. . . 109 and horizontal shelves are slightly moulded and painted) and are topped by three projecting rows of corbelling and struts, almost providing a separate shelter for the sacred texts they contain. The evident Chinese inspiration of these shelves29 (remi- niscent of the bracketing of the pavilions on the upper floor) allows us to date them to the time when the innovations ordered by Grags pa rgyal mtshan were introduced, while the fact that they are not directly integrated in the chapel structure might point to some time lag between its creation and the addition of its set of volumes, statues and paintings. ICONOGRAPHIC AND STYLISTIC DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TWO CHAPELS The visual and conceptual centre of gravity of the sGo gsum lha khang and bSe sgo ma lha khang are the Jinas painted in both chapels on the wall opposite the entrance (Figs.9-10). In both cases the centre of the series of Five Cosmic Buddhas is occupied by the white figure of Vairocana (rNampar snang mdzad), whose bodhyagrimudroř0 identifies him as that peculiar form of Buddha around whom the Vajradhātumaņdala unfolds, the principal mandala of the Tattvasamgraha .31 To Vairocana's right are in sequence Aksobhya and Ratnasambhava, to his left Amitābha and Amoghasiddhi, each of them painted in the characteristic colour of the space region he governs, adorned with the jewels typical of the manifestations of the samboghakãya and dis- playing his appropriate mudrã. All the Jinas sit in vajrãsana on "lunar seats" placed upon twin lotus corollas, on thrones whose bases, partially covered at the centre by drapes bearing the symbols of the various Families, are decorated on the sides by the corresponding heraldic animals or mythical beings (Hons, elephants, peacocks, horses and kinnaras). Each of the large Buddha figures is inscribed in a rectangular space delimited laterally by thin yellow strips, within which are arranged the figures of the relevant parivãra and those of masters and monks who, with a devoted attitude, look towards the Tathāgata. Under- neath the bases of the various thrones a double register runs across the images of the five Jinas; it displays the goddesses of the offerings or minor deities of the raksacakra , clearly indicating that the painting has the nature of a mandala , albeit unfolding in a linear sequence rather than in the centro-symmetrical arrangement that normally characterizes it. Notwithstanding the identity of theme and spatial arrangement of the various components of the mandala , these large paintings in the two chapels display marked iconographie and stylistic differences, providing valuable evidence of the artistic evolution reached at Zhwa lu between the 13th and 14th century.32 No doubt the changes we see are largely due to the arrival of new craftsmen and to new cultural contributions made possible by the advent of Grags pa rgyal mtshan, but they also reflect the growing autonomy of Tibetan disciples who, while still working under the guidance of Newar masters, were in the process of maturing their specific interpretation of the iconographie rules and of the dominating stylistic conventions in painting.33 Discernible iconographie differences do not concern the figures and attitudes of the Jinas; they are limited to the secondary figures around them and to the decorative</page><page sequence="8">1 10 THE TIBET JOURNAL frames. The lotus flowers at the base of the thrones in the sGo gsum lha khang feature twin corollas of large petals shown fřontally, while in the bSe sgo ma lha khang they have simple corollas, with smaller and more numerous petals that wrap the seat later- ally in an attempt to provide a sense of perspective. This attempt leads to the creation of an empty space between the lower end of the seat and the Buddha's legs poised in the vajrãsana stance, without otherwise affecting the frontal representation of the deities. In both paintings the base of the thrones is partially covered at the centre by embroidered drapes with floral motifs bearing the symbols of the Five Families,34 but only in the bSe sgo ma lha khang are these drapes flanked by the two deers evocating the dharmacakrapravartana in the park of Sarnath (Figs. 1 la and 1 lb). In the sGo gsum lha khang the space between the throne bases is filled by the group of krodhas normally placed as guardians at the mandala 's portals, while in the bSe sgo ma lha khang the same space is filled with sumptuous and diminutive floral motifs. The lower frame of the painting consists in both cases of two distinct registers. In the sGo gsum lha khang the two registers have the same height and contain figures of devas , Bodhi- sattvas and nãgarãjas all of the same size (Fig. 12). These figures are surrounded by simple, adjacent red halos against a grey-blue background decorated with the dimi- nutive flowers typical of the curtains painted on the wooden covers of contemporary Nepalese manuscripts. In the bSe sgo ma lha khang the two registers have different heights (the lower one being larger) and the decoration is constituted by scrolling tendrils running along the whole length of the frame (Fig. 13) and issuing from a centre in which two stylized hamsas are ingenuously addorsed against each other to form the shape of a vase (Fig. 14). Inside the series of circles formed by these ranks, skilfully stylized lotus flowers alternate with images of peaceful and wrathful deities (in the upper register) or with those of goddesses of the offerings (in the lower register). This decoration inspired by the vegetal world, which stands out against the dark back- ground, seems to privilege the chromatic-visual impact of the lotus flowers of various sorts and colours rather than the images of the deities, elegant and lively though they may be. The backrests of the thrones have a similar shape in the two paintings, but the gold bars marking their upper ends are more lavish and elaborate in the sGo gsum lha khang. In both cases the small toraņas surrounding the heads of the Jinas are formed by the lush, jagged tails of the mäkaras and by the coils of two nãgas firmly gripped by a garuda placed on top of the arch. However, the nāgas and the garufa are de- picted in different ways. In the sGo gsum lha khang the garuçh just shows its horned head, its large beak clutching the heads of the two snakes and arms holding them in their claws. In the bSe sgo ma lha khang a complete semi-human figure of a crouching garuda appears, with raised arms spreading out the wings and with the lower limbs gripping two therio-anthropomorphic nãgarãjas?5 The Jinas in the two chapels have the same horseshoe-shaped aureole around the head and the same small halo closely following the body shape placed like a cushion against the backrest of the throne. There are, however, considerable differences in the colours: whilst all the bSe sgo ma lha khang backrests are white and the aureole, the</page><page sequence="9">THE PAINTINGS IN THE ZHWA LU. . . 1 1 1 halo and the background inside the toraņas are consistently red,36 these same elements in the sGo gsum lha khang are presented in various combinations of red, white, green and light blue. The secondary figures, arranged around the Buddhas within individual frames with small variations in number and spatial distribution between the two paintings, reveal conspicuous differences in the two chapels. In the bSe sgo ma lha khang these figures sit on more garish, multicoloured thrones, with painstakingly defined backrests and cushions and with halos embracing the whole figure, including the aureole. In the sGo gsum lha khang they fill more fully the available space and are surrounded by small halos only reaching to their shoulders, leaving out completely the head and aureole, but also the arms in various postures and sometimes even the legs poised in different ãsanas. The relatively bigger size (two figures instead of three are stacked on either side of the throne) and the greater freedom in the display of the various postures in this case produce less stereotyped results, while the lighter colour of the figures allows a better appreciation of the drawing quality. The differences are particularly marked in the figures distributed in the corners formed by the toraņa at the top of the frame. In fact, the painting in the bSe sgo ma lha khang is closed at the top by a series of green-red festoons in trompe l'œil technique which are not present in the other chapel and which conpress the figurines in the top register into more rigidly defined spaces. The figures at the top of the sGo gsum lha khang are also different due to the presence of arhats and pratyekabuddhas clad in monastic robes, in attitudes of devoted concentration and gazing at the Jinas. The trunk tilting towards the centre, with the head stretched forward and sometimes with a partial overlap of the figures, lends this group a high degree of naturalism. The decorative strips running the whole length of the wall with the five Jinas of the Vajradhātumaņdala differ from each other not just in the relatively simple conception of the former (Fig. 12) as opposed to the elaborately rich structure of the latter (Fig. 13), but also in the profound stylistic differences characterizing the figures of the deities painted in the two registers. The devas and nãgarãjas in the sGo gsum lha khang are beautifully outlined with simple black lines and with summarily drawn shading (Figs. 15a and 15b) reminiscent of the drawings in the iconographie sketchbooks the Newar painters often took with them in their wanderings from one monastery to the other.37 The goddesses of the offerings in the bSe sgo ma lha khang (Figs. 16 a and b), in- scribed in floral scrolls which in many respects recall to our mind the decorated initial letters of ancient western manuscripts, are in fact accurate illuminations inspired to the life and costumes of the Nepalese courts.38 In the flexuousness of the bodies and in the conscious elegance of the postures they reflect an open sensuousness that is not to be found in the symbolic sexual unions of the devas in the other chapel. But the more significant stylistic differences are in the figures of the Jinas, notably their faces, the curve of their shoulders, the shape and length of the arms, the rendering of the volumes. These differences can easily be seen by direct comparison of the various Buddhas in the two versions of the sGo gsum lha khang and of the bSe sgo ma lha khang. A comparison of the two figures of Vairocana (Figs.17-18) reveals how, although in both cases the dimensions of the upper arms are exaggerated,39 in the bSe</page><page sequence="10">112 THE TIBET JOURNAL sgo ma lha khang image the arms join the armpit at a lower point,40 with the forearm tapering abruptly, thus unbalancing the proportions of the whole deity. Clearly dif- ferent proportions can also be seen in the legs which, still in the latter case, are more slender and longer, with thinner ankles and a more pointed curve of the bent knees, whilst also the hourglass shape of the trunk is more marked. Conversely, in the former case the neck rises more clearly above the line of the shoulders, while in the latter it is more inset in the chest, despite the fact that this effect is compensated by moving the curves of the three conventional beauty folds to a lower position. On the whole we can state that the Vairocana figure in the sGo gsum lha khang is bulkier and at the same time more naturally elegant, while the one in the bSe sgo ma lha khang is more slender but not so beautifully proportioned. Quite similar considerations can be made by comparing the figures of Ratnasam- bhava (Figs. 19-20) and Aksobhya (Figs.21-22) in the two paintings. For these two Tathāgatas the differences are even more accentuated by the fact that their mudrās (varadamudrā and bhūmisparšamudrā respectively) make even more apparent the above-mentioned disproportion of the arms in the images of the bSe sgo ma lha khang. The distance introduced by the partially prospectic view of the seat between Buddha's knees and the rim reached by the hand extended in the mudrã adds in these cases to the already mentioned frailty of the forearm, and generates the impression that the arm is too long. The palm of the hand, too, remarkably narrower, contributes to enhance this disproportion. The Ratnasambhava figure in the bSe sgo ma lha khang also displays, much more clearly than in the figure of Vairocana, a decidedly elliptical shape of the shoulders, a new and original trait quite rightly noted by Vitali as a characteristic aspect of many paintings at Zhwa lu.41 This elliptical curve at the top of the torso further accentuates the already mentioned tendency for the neck to be inset, leading to a more evident use of folds now well below the shoulder line. Equally conspicuous stylistic differences distinguish the paintings of the two chapels as far as the faces are concerned. The fundamental difference is represented here by the opposition between the shorter, wider and square faces of Figs.23-25 in the sGo gsum lha khang and the more elongated, oval ones of Figs.26-28 in the bSe sgo ma lha khang 42 The different contours determine different relative positions of the internal features, endowing the faces with different expressions. The curve of the chin, open and touching the contours in the former figures, is more closed and slightly detached from the contour of the latter.43 Associated with the pointed chin is in this case a mouth which, albeit traced following the same scheme (upper lip fully outlined at both upper and lower ends, lower lip just hinted by a short open curve forming a cuspid at the centre) is narrower and more arched, and its ends tend to wrap the nostrils. As a consequence of the higher forehead, all the other facial features, clustered around the centre by the oval contour of the face, are moved to a lower position, and the nose, although of the same shape and length in the two paintings,44 consequently appears almost slightly hooked (see especially Aksobhya's face in Fig.28). The eyes, thin and elongated towards the temples, are horizontal in the figures of the sGo gsum lha khang, while they are slightly slanting in those of the bSe sgo ma</page><page sequence="11">THE PAINTINGS IN THE ZHWA LU. . . 1 13 lha khang. The eyebrows, drawn with clear lines converging at the root of the nose and inverting their curvature at the ends, are similar in the two cases, but in the bSe sgo ma • lha khang paintings they reveal more marked convexities allowing a greater extension of the upper eyelid and of the eye socket. The treatment of the Jiñas' hair employs similar solutions in the two sets of figures. In both cases the hair comes out onto the forehead from beneath the crown with a cuspidate shape (interrupted at the centre by the parting of the hair) and with the same tidy series of locks which fall from both sides of the head following the profile of the large earrings and framing the shoulders. The jagged and wavy tufts falling on the front part of the torso are longer, freer and thinner in Figs.26-28, shorter and curlier in Figs.23-25. Small differences can also be noticed in other details, like for instance the shape of the ear (which in the figures of the sGo gsum lha khang has a freer and larger cavity) and the "drop" shape of the ūrņā (which in the same figures seems to more explicitly hint at the transcendent vision of the third eye). Quite remarkable differences can be seen in the use of colours and shadings em- ployed to render the relief of faces and limbs. While in the case of the white Vairocana a certain sense of volume is achieved in essentially the same way in both paintings with a light pink-grey shading that delicately marks the eye sockets, the structure of the chin and the anatomy of the torso, the figures of the other Jinas (notably Aksobhya and Amitābha) display radically different treatments. In the sGo gsum lha khang the dark colour required by the iconographie conven- tions for these Tathāgatas and the relative poorness of the pigments used have in fact constrained the artist to use very sombre tones of shading (almost black in the case of Aksobhya) which, generally starting from the contours, sometimes define the areas in relief in a very crude way, in sharp contrast with the colour of the background (Fig.2 1 ). Despite this harshness of treatment the torsos appear nevertheless modelled with a compelling effectiveness, very well emphasizing the anatomical structure outlined by the sternum, the chest muscles and the abdomen, while the relief of arms and shoulders appears less realistic. In the bSe sgo ma lha khang the availability of different and more refined pig- ments (apparent also in the affectation of the sumptuous decoration discussed earlier) allowed a rendition of relief with a smoother transition of intensity within the same colour tone, obtaining shading effects only partly heightened at the outlines by the addition of black and ochre. But this more delicate treatment resulted in flatter images, which the painter compensated in the figure of Aksobhya by introducing white "spots of light" on the shoulders and on the raised parts of the abdomen (Fig.22). In the analysis of the stylistic evolution at Zhwa-lu the opportunity offered by the two large paintings representing the basic iconographie scenario of the sGo gsum lha khang and bSe sgo ma lha khang has been preferred, for these paintings do not pre- sent the difficulties of interpretation which in other cases would be added by the differences in themes and subjects. But two brief remarks suggested by other paintings in these chapels may be appropriate. The first one concerns the representation of wrathful manifestations of deities of the Tibetan pantheon. In the figure of Trailokyavijaya at the east end of the north wall in the sGo gsum lha khang (Fig.29) and in that of Sitācala on the south wall of the bSe</page><page sequence="12">1 14 THE TIBET JOURNAL sgo ma lha khang (Fig.30) the fundamental identity of the solutions adopted to express their force and terrific qualities is striking. In these two figures, although different and in different stances, we find the same mighty body, the same swollen abdomen, the same bulging eyes and the same angry expression with which they bite their lower lip. The stylistic differences, mostly confined to relatively accessory aspects like the flut- tering stole and the flaming halo surrounding Sitãcala, or Trailokyavijaya's radiating nimbus, do not affect the structure of these images. It is surprising how this structure is constantly encountered in the sKu 'bum of Gyantse and in all Tibetan temples of the 15th century. It would seem that, as early as the end of the 13th century, the icono- graphie and stylistic conventions used for wrathful deities (resulting from an earlier elaboration of the figure of Bhairava-Šiva in the Indo-Nepalese tradition) show the achieved fixation in a code that was to continue without any significant changes for the centuries to come. The second remark refers to the large figure of Sâkyamuni painted on the south wall of the bSe sgo ma lha khang (Fig.31). In a painting in which the real or imaginary beings framing the throne backrest (elephant, lion, kinnara , vyãlaká) closely follow the schemes of the Pãla-Sena tradition of north-east India, stylistic new solutions were put forward. The tendency towards an elegant geometrization is here manifested in the elliptical curve of the shoulders, in the heart-shaped head of the Buddha, and in the regular design of the folds of the robe falling from the shoulder or flowing over the bent knees. These are solutions which, whether they be due to local painters or to Newar masters operating in the Land of Snows, characterize original tendencies of Tibetan painting. Conclusions The analysis of the two versions of the Vajradhātumaņdala painted on the main walls of the sGo gsum lha khang and bSe sgo ma lha khang has evidenced considerable stylistic differences between two works equally fundamental for the ritual charac- terization of the two chapels, conceived following an identical iconographie plan and having the same dimensions, but separated by some 15 years. In the main, these dif- ferences are most likely attributable to changes that took place in the team of painters working in these chapels, but no doubt they also reflect changes in the economic conditions which allowed the use of finer and better-quality pigments that helped the blooming growth of the ornamental and decorative elements. The painting in the sGo gsum lha khang, executed during the rule of sku zhang mGon po dpal, provides evidence for the presence of painters active at Zhwa lu before new artists and craftsmen were summoned following Grags pa rgyal mtshan's trip to Peking in 1306. Many iconographie elements and stylistic peculiarities of their work reveal that the creators of this first painting were the bearers of a Nepalese version of the Pāla-Sena painting tradition: their style can be defined Šakya-Newar, similarly to what was done for the painters of the thang kas which were made in that period for the patriarchs of the Sa skya pa school. However, it is not unreasonable to think that under the guidance of Newar masters there were already Tibetan assistants who were thus acquiring iconographie rules and painting techniques, at the same time maturing their specific bents and tendencies.45</page><page sequence="13">THE PAINTINGS IN THE ZHWA LU. . . 1 1 5 The changes introduced with the new painting in the bSe sgo ma lha khang reveal a refined painting technique and a great attention to detail, particularly in the deco- rative strips of the bottom frame. Typically Nepalese motifs and figures are treated here with exceptional care and precision, and with a wealth of colours and shadings that suscitate pleasure and wonder in the observer: one is literally seduced by the lavishness and perfection of the details, by the affectation of plant and floral motifs, by the elegance and grace with which the goddesses of the ritual offerings are portrayed. However, on the whole this second depiction of the group of Jinas, excep- tionally charming though it may be, betrays on closer scrutiny a somewhat rigid and scholastic interpretation. Rather than the vigorous artistic conception transpiring in the figures of the sGo gsum lha khang, an exceptional craftsmanship seems to be at work here. Maybe exactly because of this masterly execution Vitali was led to think that all the paintings in the Zhwa lu monastery were due to the return to Tibet of the mythical group of painters that Aniko had taken with him to Peking 50 years earlier. The funda- mental improbability of this conjecture and its contradictions with the variety of styles and schools attested in the paintings of the skor lam (and in particular the existence of a considerable number of masterpieces proudly signed by the Tibetan painter Chims pa bSod nams 'bum) does not rule out the possibility that, among the many artists and artisans hired from all places by Grags pa rgyal mtshan, there may also have been Nepalese painters coming from the imperial workshops. Put in a highly varied context and in contact with an already established Newar tradition and with a Tibetan school that had been forming for quite some time, it might be just these painters who were responsible for the fine achievements of the Vajradhātumaņdala in the bSe sgo ma lha khang. The comparison of the two paintings examined here in detail and the analysis of the other works promoted by the fervent initiative of Grags pa rgyal mtshan shows how, between the 13th and 14th century, in spite of countless political and cultural restraints and through the exchange and circulation of models and painters coming from dif- ferent schools, Zhwa lu enjoyed a time of extraordinary growth and ripening of the Tibetan painting tradition. Notes 1 . In Tibetan literature there is a continuous alternation between the homophonous forms Nyang, used for instance in Bu ston 's rnarn thar , and Myang, as can be found for instance in the title of the historical work known as Myang chung. 2. The fragmentation of the old state structure was codified at the time of bstan pa phyi dar , when the territories of dBus and gTsang were subdivided into new entities called tsho , governed by religious masters originating from the old clans which often already held the authority over those lands. In practice the dbus gtsang mi bcu , the "ten men of dBus gTsang" introduced this subdivision of the land and the corresponding tax system ( khral tsho): thus, from the very beginning, the role of the new abbots and that of the noble families from which they came was somewhat blurred. 3. Vitali, 1990, p.92.</page><page sequence="14">1 1 6 THE TIBET JOURNAL 4. The term zhang already appears in royal times in zhang blon , the title of a minister. Probably it already had the meaning of "maternal uncle", for ministers were often chosen from the mother's clan of the btsan po. 5. The expression yon mchod properly indicates the relationship originally established between noble Tibetan locals and abbots of individual monasteries. The lay patron en- sured safety and material support, while the religious institution ensured "protection from heaven" and observance of the doctrine by the subjects. This definition was subse- quently extended to the relationship between Mongol princes and the grand lamas of the main Buddhist schools, then to the relationship between Buddhist Church and Chinese Empire. The subjective Tibetan interpretation of this relationship as a mutual and equal one may be at the origin of an ambiguity that would continue in time and affect, in the following centuries, the complex situation of relations between Tibet and China. 6. The two decrees are included in the "Documents of Zhwa lu" published in Tibetan Painted Scrolls (Tucci, 1949, p.747, 1 and II). These documents include, among others, eight decrees issued in favour of the myriarchs of Zhwa lu by the various ti shihs who were in office in Peking, from Shar pa Ye shes rin chen (1286-1291) to Kun dga' rgyal mtshan dPal bzang po (1331-1358) (Ibid. pp. 670-72 and pp. 747-50). The "Documents of Zhwa lu," together with the documents later published by the Cultural Relics Publish- ing House in Lhasa (sGrol dkar et al. 1994, Nos. 1-22), constitute an invaluable help to understanding the way in which the imperial administration operated in Tibet, and in particular to understand the true nature of the relationship between the Sa skya pa hierarchs and the Emperor. 7. sKu zhang mGon po dpal's daughter, Ma gcig gZhon nu 'bum, became married to the bdag nyid chen po (mahātma) bZang po dpal (1262-1323), nephew of 'Phags pa and only remaining son and heir of the 'Khon family. 8. One of the "Documents of Zhwa lu," issued in 1 304 by the ti shih 'Jam dbyangs Rin chen rgyal mtshan, restates a series of exemptions and privileges accorded to lay and religious communities of territories subject to this sku zhangs (Tucci 1949, p.747, III). Also the famous Mongol text, written in phags pa characters, issued in 1305 by Hay-shan, prince of Houai-ning (who then became emperor in 1307 with the Mongol name Külük Khagan), confirms the exemptions and privileges for the clergy under the jurisdiction of the monas- tery of Zhwa lu, belonging to the sku zhang rDo ije dbang phyug and Grags pa rgyal mtshan. The text in question, translated and commented by Paul Pelliot and included in Tibetan Painted Scrolls (Tucci 1949, pp.62 1-24), now appears in the collection of the Archives of the Yuan Dynasty published by the Autonomous Region of Tibet (sGrol dkar, 1994, No. 14). 9. The three regions indicated by the term chol kha were Thu-fan, corresponding to present-day Amdo and part of northern Kham, Hsi-fan, that is most of present-day Kham, and Wu-ssu-tsang, that is Central and Western Tibet. 10. Bu ston held this position until 1356, under three sku zhangs in sequence (Grags pa rgyal mtshan, Kun dga' don grub, Ye shes kun dga'): from him originated the Bu lugs pa or Zhwa lu pa school. 11. In actual fact the cloister was then repeatedly modified/reorganized in the following centuries. 12. The plan shown here derives from the surveys made by Wang Yi (Wang Yi 1960, pp.52- 65 and Fig.24 on p.59), by Chen Yaodong (Chen Yaodong 1994, pp.4-36 and Figs. 1-3 on p. 6) and by Philip Denwood (Denwood, 1997, pp.220-29, Fig.257 on p.222 and Fig.263 on p.227), but it has been corrected and partially integrated on the basis of onsite</page><page sequence="15">THE PAINTINGS IN THE ZHWA LU. . . 1 17 surveys. Although a complete and precise dimensioned architectural survey is not available at present, we can take this as a faithful description of the real structure. 13. Therefore in the east dbu rtse the mgon khang , the Yum chen mo lha khang, and the bsTan 'gyur lha khang are placed one on top of the other. 14.

A short mention is then very synthetically taken up further on in the list of the content of the various chapels: byang du Thub pa chen po (to the north is Mahãmuni). 19. Tucci, 1949, pp.656-62. The colophon of this text also provides a summary list of the sources it is based upon: All these things, according to what can be found in the guidebook of the very holy Thugs ije chen po, taking as a basis the list of the abbots, the popular tales, the philo- logical works of Don grub rgyal mgon, written according to Bu ston' s method, the all- knowing master of the Kalvyuga , and above all taking the information from the biogra- phies which are usefully consulted on this subject, like those of the two oldest sku zhangs and that of sku zhang Rin chen mKhyen rab mchog grub dpal bzang po and those of that vajra of our corrupt times who was dGe 'phel from sNye mo. [This information] has been truthfully committed to writing by bKra shis don grub (he who is called Mangalāmoghasiddhi) to preserve an indestructible memory of it, and this was done for the benefit of all posterity and to the advantage of the great progeny of the sku zhangs , the lama lords of the glorious Zhwa lu gSer khang, which is the Bodhgayâ of Tibet. The list given in this colophon ends with the 1 1th abbot lHa'i btsun Bio bzang bstan pa who came to the seat in the year 1537. The truncation of the list at that point and the lack of the date on which he left the abbatial throne (1543) means that the "Genealogies" were composed in the span of time from 1537 to 1543. Despite the fairly late date of redaction, this text is thus supposed to faithfully reflect the tradition transmitted within the lineage of Zhwa lu. 20. sKal bzang and rGyal po, 1987, pp. 19-20. 21 . It is interesting that in this text the name changes from bSe sgo ma to gSer sgo ma, hence from "Chapel with the leather door" to "Chapel with the golden door." 22. The gold of the Jāmbū river, the river of the golden sand ( jāmbūnadasuvarņa ), was con- sidered the finest, the gold used by the Cakravartin. 23. It seems likely that the text Tucci obtained incorrectly mixed up in this passage the three statues of the Buddhas with the 108 copies of the Prajftāpāramitā and that it mistakenly transferred everything from the chapel (bSe sgo ma lha khang) to the leather door (bSe sgo ma). 24. In this connection one should take account of the fact that in Tibetan architecture, as in Nepal, the frames are not added after completion of the building, but are part of the construction process of the walls with specific structural functions. 25. Considering that some texts mention the decoration of this door with a myriad of small figures of the Buddha and bearing in mind the alternative form gSer sgo ma lha khang</page><page sequence="16">1 1 8 THE TIBET JOURNAL adopted by the Zhwa lu dgon gyi lo rgyus, the hypothesis could be made that this was in fact a lining of the door with embossed and gilded copper sheet. 26. One should not forget that, in either case, the carving is not made on the lintel itself, but on panels applied to it. 27. Some of these volumes, removed to the Ri phug hermitage, were saved from the destruction operated by the Red Guards during the years of the Cultural Revolution, and were later recovered by the Zhwa lu monastery. 28. The parallel with the Indian prototype of the kalaša containing the elixir of immortality ( amfta ) is obvious. 29. Miniature versions of the wooden buildings for the sūtra shelves were made in the Tat'ung library under the Liao (916-1 125) and the Northern Sung (960-1 127) (Bussagli, 1981, p.80). 30. In this mudrā the forefinger of the left hand, with the open palm facing outwards, is enclosed by the right hand with thumb and middlefinger joined in a ring and with fore- finger and little finger stretched in a gesture reminiscent of the tarjanīmudrā. In Japanese Buddhism and in the Shingon school in particular, essentially based on the two great mandala* of the Vajradhātu and Dharmadhätu (Yamasaki, 1988, pp.23-55; Lokesh Chandra, 1986, pp.54- 127), the corresponding mudrā of Dainichi Nyoray (chi ken-in) is made by holding the forefinger of the left hand with the right fist with the back facing outside (Saunders 1985, pp. 102-7). The bodhyagrimudrã expresses full control of supreme transcendent knowledge and the fullest realization of Buddhahood. It does not refer to the propagation or illustration of the Doctrine, like the dharmacakramudrā and vitarkamudrā with which it could at first sight be confused, but it symbolizes that aspect of knowledge which is typical of Vairocana as the supreme deity combining in himself the knowledge of all Buddhas. 31. In addition to its enormous influence in the development of Tantric Buddhism, the Tattvasamgraha exercised a crucial influence on Buddhist art, notably on Tibetan Bud- dhist art, through the visual representation of its mançlalas in sculptures and paintings. Also the five Jinas in the two chapels at Zhwa lu can be seen as a representation of the Vajradhātumaņ&amp;la restricted to the fundamental nucleus of the five Cosmic Buddhas in the glorious form of samboghakäya in which they manifest themselves in the Pure Lands. 32. The interest presented by the comparison of the two paintings has been pointed out by Hugo Kreijger in his communication at the London conference of 1994, but the com- parison itself does not seem to have received the attention it deserves. It is the purpose of this note to provide new and more diverse material. 33. The independent role gradually assumed by Tibetan painters is evidenced at Zhwa lu by the series of beautiful paintings in the skor lam of the Yum chen mo lha khang, contem- poraneous with those of the bSe sgo ma lha khang and proudly signed by mChims pa bSod nams 'bum. 34. As far as Amoghasiddhi is concerned, while in the sGo gsum lha khang the usual višva- vajra is shown, in the bSe sgo ma lha khang the symbol is a sword. 35. The human figures of a nāgarāja and a nāgarājnī , both with the heads protected by small serpents in a conch-shell arrangement and with their bodies enclosed by a small flaming halo, are painted as fleeing away from the big garufa who clutches their thighs, while the snake-like element is limited to the long coiling tails. 36. An exception is the image of Amitābha, whose red colour dictates the use of different colours (green aureole and light blue halo) in order to provide the necessary contrast against the background.</page><page sequence="17">THE PAINTINGS IN THE ZHWA LU. . . 1 19 37. Although much later, Jivarama's sketchbook (Lowry, 1977, pp. 107-9) can provide a basis for comparison. 38. In this respect it is useful to compare the goddess of the dance in Fig. 16b with the court dancer painted in the great skor lam on the ground floor of the same monastery (Vitali, 1990, pl. 58). 39. The exaggerated breadth of the shoulders is a common feature in the iconography of the Buddha, meant to underline his power and unshakeability. 40. In both paintings the attaching point of the arms is drawn with cuspidate curves culmi- nating in the armpit and then descending to define the breast lines. 41. Vitali, 1990, pp. 107-8. 42. In this ovalization of the faces we can possibly recognize the beginning of an evolution that would eventually lead to the "heart-shape" we can see in the figure of Buddha Sâkya- muni painted on the south wall of the same chapel. This peculiar stylistic outcome is at- tested in more or less accentuated forms in various paintings of the skor lam of the Yum chen mo lha khang, on the intermediate floor of the east dbu rtse. The same convention will be used a few years later in the paintings of the Lori stūpa (Neumann, 1 994, Figs.27 and 29). 43. Also in the faces, as we could observe for the full figure, the differences are not so marked in the case of Vairocana, almost as if his objective central position and signi- ficance had induced a closer retention of the initial model in the reproduction of the mandala in the second chapel. One could even surmise that this central figure might have been painted by a different artist. 44. The rendering of the nose is obtained in both paintings by two short lines defining its root at the inner end of the eyes, by a clear outline of the nostrils and by the shading de- scending from the eyebrows. Furthermore, in the Akçobhya figure the crest of the nose is defined by a thin white line (in the same figure touches of white are used to underline the curves of the chin, the lower lip, and the folds of the neck). 45. Traces of these might be constituted for instance by a certain anomaly of Amogha- siddhi's face which, less rigidly square, seems in a way to anticipate the evolution to- wards the "heart-shape" that will later become manifest in some paintings of the bSe sgo ma lha khang and of the skor lam on the intermediate floor.
