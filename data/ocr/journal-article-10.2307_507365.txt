<plain_text><page sequence="1">Archaeology in Turkey: The Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, 1997-1999 ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING* The four years since this newsletter last appeared have been momentous ones in the history of Tur- key and also in the archaeology of that country. In the terrible earthquakes of 1999 that took so many lives, some ancient monuments were damaged and work on some projects was cut short. Also in 1999, the visit of former U.S. president Bill Clinton to Ephesos raised public awareness of Turkish archae- ology worldwide at a time when tourist numbers were threatening to flounder following a period of unrest and natural disasters. The completion of several large dam projects, which flooded large ar- eas of Turkey, also brought about many new excava- tions and surveys aimed at recording and recover- ing as much archaeology as possible before the fi- nal inundation and, in some cases, also making news headlines worldwide. Since 1998, these dam construction projects on the Euphrates and Tigris rivers have triggered a new round of international rescue work in the Karkamish and Ilisu Dam areas, which is, for the first time, accompanied by intense public debate. The impending flooding of the exceptional Ro- man site of Zeugma-Apamea was watched critically by both the Turkish and foreign press. It is thanks to this publicity that generous funding and a large international emergency team was set up to rescue the threatened mosaics. The situation at Zeugma is, of course, extraordinary and does not apply to most of the rescue excavations. Archaeological research in Turkey greatly profit- ed from earlier dam construction projects, exem- plified by the Keban Dam Project on the Upper Euphrates (see figs. 1-3). Prior to its construction in 1968, eastern Anatolia had been an almost com- *The authors are enormously indebted to the previous au- thor, Marie-Henriette Gates, without whose sage advice this undertaking would not have been possible. The majority of this article is based on notes taken at the 22nd International Symposium of Excavations, Surveys andArchaeometryin Izmir (22-26 May 2000) and from published works. Where the pri- mary excavators have been so kind to provide us with reports or illustrations themselves, we have gratefully included these, al- beit sometimes in an abridged or translated form. Patient assis- tance has also been provided by the staff of the British Insti- plete blank on the archaeological map. A survey of the Keban Dam lake zone recorded 67 archaeolog- ical sites, 19 of which were investigated further. Of these 19 mounds, seven were excavated on a larger scale, and the remaining ones were tested by sound- ings. The information collected during seven years of rescue excavation still forms the core of what we understand of the cultural history of the Upper Euphrates. At the same time, these numbers illus- trate well the problem that archaeology encoun- ters when faced with such an ambitious project. In the Keban Dam area, a minimum of 48 sites have been submerged without any possibility of further investigation. These sites were recorded during the survey and therefore represent only the visible sites in the affected area. A certain number of sites must have remained undetected, about which we know nothing. The true extent of the loss in terms of human history can only be imagined. A site such as Nevalh Cori, which today symbolizes the importance of Turkey's southeast as one of the main stages of the "Neolithic Revolution" and which was flooded in 1992 by the Ataturk Dam, had not even been detected by the preliminary survey. As with earlier projects, the new salvage projects are being coordinated and evaluated by the Mid- dle East Technical University (METU) Centre for Research and Assessment of the Historic Environ- ment (TA(DAM). A total of 250 sites have so far been recorded in the Karkamish and Ilisu Dam zones, and excavations by Turkish and internation- al teams have begun. Hasankeyf is the most famous site of those currently under threat, but there are others of equal historical importance. The initial results are exciting and promise to fill blanks in tute of Archaeology at Ankara, J. Robert Travis of Liverpool University, and most of all by Sfiheyla Gedik of Hacettepe Uni- versity. To all of the above the authors extend their very deep- est gratitude. It is the very nature of any article of this kind that there will inevitably be mistakes and oversights in the material present- ed, especially given the extended duration since M.-H. Gates's last installment. We trust that our readers will be kind to our mistakes and hope that the revival of this series will encourage more excavators to submit reports for inclusion next year. 463 American Journal of Archaeology 105 (2001) 463-511</page><page sequence="2">z 0 Cr pzc t-Li ttl z 0~ Fig. 1.

The Karkemish Dam area (Map: Archeographics) our understanding of Turkey's archaeological her- itage, but even this cannot disguise the impending loss of two more historical landscapes. It can only be hoped that the feverish salvage activities taking place over the coming two years in the Karkamish reservoir and the next seven years in the Illsu Dam lake zone will allow for the documentation of as much archaeological information as possible. In the last four years, research in other areas has also created a flood of new data on all periods of Anatolian archaeology. Our understanding of the transition from hunter-gatherer to sedentary life- styles has undergone rapid changes as a result of the impact of two new excavations in the Urfa area, at Gobekli Tepe and Gurcutepe. Here, complex hunter-gatherer communities appear to have been responsible for the erection of megalithic monu- ments and for the creation of a fascinating rock art style long before farming began to seriously trans- form human lifestyles. G6bekli Tepe pushes back the chronological starting point of art in south- east Anatolia and must add further doubts to the Levantine primacy model of Neolithization. On the other hand, relations between central Anato- lia, Syria, and the Levant show up more clearly now thanks to excavations at the obsidian quarry and workshop site of K6mufrcii/Kaletepe. Stylistic dif- ferences between the lithic assemblages of the workshop and those of the local settlements hint at a level of organization behind the obsidian ex- ploitation that was even more complex than was previously thought. Central Anatolian Neolithic chronology can now be set on its own feet: data from the new Musular exca- vations bridge the chronological gap between late Asikli and earliest (atalh6yuik, and radiocarbon dates are now available for all these sites. Other missing links reportedly have been found on the Euphrates: rescue excavations in the Karkamish Dam area at the two new sites of Akarcay and Mezraa Teleilat revealed cultural sequences that cross the poorly understood transition from aceramic to ceramic Neolithic. The Chalcolithic period has, as usual, also been a focus of academic attention in recent years. Late Chalcolithic-Uruk interaction has been a favorite research topic, reflected both in excavations and in conferences, making the results from the new Cap- padocian site Giivercinkayasl all the more welcome. A seal and some pottery hint at relations with the north Syrian Ubaid culture and push the border of Ubaid contacts even further toward the northwest. A real highlight has been the discovery of an Early Bronze Age (EB I) "princely tomb" in a kurgan-like structure at Arslantepe. Together with the prince, new questions about Caucasian-Euphrates relations have been unearthed. The metal assemblage from this tomb held several unusual alloys previously vir- tually unknown at such an early time. New dots can be added to the map of third mil- lennium B.C. urban centers. The urbanization boom at the end of EB II, well illustrated at Titris H6yfik, is now also visible at Kazane H6yiik and Tilbeshar. For the Hittite Middle and Late Bronze Age, ex- cavations continued at major central Anatolian sites such as Kfiltepe, Acemhoyuk, Kusakli, and Bogazk6y, but research on the periphery of Hittite Anatolia has also brought to light many new discov- eries. Archaeological surveys of (ankir/Paphlago- nia and $anllurfa have also shed new light on these Hittite border regions, and at Kinet Hoyuk excava- tions have revealed an important Hittite presence in the Hatay region. In western Anatolia, at Troy, the excavation of a spring cavern is related to the deity dKASKAL.KUR, mentioned in a Hittite treaty with Wilusa, which appears to strengthen the iden- tification of (W)Ilios (i.e., Troy) with Wilusa.

The Ilisu Dam area (Map: Archeographics) tion by David Hawkinsl has advanced our under- standing of the historical geography of western Anatolia in the Late Bronze Age. In light of this new research and new archaeological discoveries, Recip Meri? has identified the site of Torbali- Bademgedigi Ho6yfuii with Puranda, the castle of the king of Arzawa, Tapalazunawalis. The continuing excavations at Miletos, now iden- tified by an increasing number of scholars with the site of Millawanda, destroyed by Mursili II, uncov- ered more evidence for Mycenaean occupation at the site, especially in the 1999 season. Mycenaean pottery has also been found at G6okeada, Torball, and Kilise Tepe, and two important new articles on the subject have recently appeared.2 In September 1999, a conference held at Gfizel?aml to celebrate 100 years of excavations at Miletos included a day of papers on Ionia in the Bronze Age, and the pub- lication of these is expected to further our under- standing of this period and region. All these sites and regions are discussed in more detail below. A brief outline of recent developments at major Iron Age sites in Turkey is included here, although this is by no means exhaustive, and a summary of the archaeology of Iron Age and Classical Anato- lia is in preparation. In the meantime, for recent developments in classical archaeology in Turkey, Stephen Mitchell has compiled a survey article 1 Hawkins 1998. 2I.e., Penelope Mountjoy's (1998) studyof the eastAegean- west Anatolian interface, and Christopher Mee's (1998) up- date of his 1978 article on Anatolia and the Aegean. 3Mitchell 1998-1999, table, 125. with a particularly useful table3 that gives concor- dance, from 1988 to 1996, between the major re- port formats for new archaeological information in Turkey: KST, Ara4ST, MKK, and this AJA news- letter.

In combination with those resources, this article is a forum in which the results of work by smaller excavation and survey teams based in Turkey can be put alongside the household names of world prehistory, such as Troy and (atalhoyfik (figs. 1-3). BIBLIOGRAPHIC REVIEW Conferences. Progress reports on all archaeo- logical projects in Turkey are presented each year at the annual International Symposium of Excava- tions, Surveys and Archaeometry, which tradition- ally has been held in the last week of May in Anka- ra. In 1997 (26-30 May) it was hosted by Ankara University; in 1998 (25-30 May) it was held in the Tarsus Cultural Centre; in 1999 (24-28 May) it was at the National Library in Ankara; and in 2000 it convened in Izmir at the Buyuk Efes Centre.4 The third INQUA meeting was held under the title of "Third Symposium on the Late Quaternary of the Eastern Mediterranean" at M.T.A. in Anka- ra on 1-4 April 1997.

Preliminary results from ongoing research at the Late Chalcolithic site Hacinebi Tepesi were pre- sented at the SAA meeting at Seattle in March 1998. The urgent necessity of rethinking current approaches to the so-called Uruk expansion was reflected in all the papers, which are now pub- lished, with additional comments, in Paleorient 25 (2000). For the prehistory of western Anatolia, two im- portant conferences were "The Aegean in the Neolithic, Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age," held in Urla/Izmir on 13-19 October 1997 and "Early Ionia: the state of research," held in Gu- zelcamli from 27 September to 1 October 1999. Both of these conferences await publication. At the "Uluslararasi Kilikia Arkeolojisi Sem- pozyumu," held in Mersin on 1-4 June 1998, vari- ous aspects of Cilician archaeology from the Bronze Age to the Medieval period were present- ed and were published as volume two of the new journal OLBA. In May 1999, there was also a round- table discussion hosted by the French Institute in Istanbul, "La Cilicie: Espace et pouvoirs locaux (2eme millenaire avJ.-C.-4eme siecle ap.J.-C.)," which awaits publication. The chronology of the fourth and third millen- nia from the Caucasus to northern Syria was dis- cussed at a roundtable symposium in Istanbul in December 1998.5 A symposium was held in Ankara in May andJune 1999 to celebrate 50 years of exca- vataions at Kultepe-Kanis, and has once again fo- cused attention on this important site. Although only marginally related to Turkey, the publication of the Karanovo conference includes several contributions important for Neolithic re- seach in western Turkey.6 Also, a conference on the Tishreen rescue project on the Syrian Euph- rates, held at Barcelona in 1998, has yielded re- sults equally important for current research in the area immediately to its north. The results have been published as a supplement volume of the Aula Orientalis series. Museums.

After a pre-Festschrift published by her colleagues and students in 1995 as "Readings in Prehistory: Studies presented to Halet (ambel," Halet Cambel also received a seri- ous Festschrift with a rich variety of articles by friends, colleagues, and students.7 The untimely death of Sandor Bokonyi was commemorated with a memorial volume including articles on many of his favorite topics, written by the scholars with whom he had worked.8 The 50th anniversary of the Brit- ish Institute of Archaeology at Ankara was celebrat- ed with the edition of a volume summarizing all the excavation projects for which the Institute has been responsible during the last half century.9 The 100th anniversary of the German Archaeo- logical Institute in 1999 was honored with an exhi- bition and a bilingual catalogue reviewing the In- stitute's engagement in Turkey.10 Journals and selected publications. Anatolian Stud- ies (AnatSt), the journal of the British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara, has received a makeover. It still appears annually and publishes articles, large- ly in English, on the archaeology and related sub- jects of Turkey and the surrounding areas. These continue to be of a high standard but the journal itself now has a new format and cover. The first is- sue in this new format, volume 48 (1998), contains a number of important articles as well as shorter notes, whereas volume 49 (1999) is given over to the publication of the proceedings of the Anato- lian Iron Ages Four colloquium, held in Mersin, 19-23 May 1997. Another rebaptized journal is Ancient Near East- ern Studies (ANES), published by the University of Melbourne, which continues the series formerly known as Abr-Nahrain. The journal has received a complete update in format and style but will keep to its existing focus on the Near East and border- ing areas. In his new role as editor, A. Sagona re- ports that the supplement series for the publica- tion of substantial monographic studies will also continue. Two new journal series have been introduced since 1997, the University of Mersin's Cilicia Ar- chaeological Research Centre has published Mers- in Universitesi Kilikia Arkeolojisini Arastzrma Merkezi Yayznlarz (OLBA), which is dedicated to archaeolog- ical and epigraphic research in Cilicia and adja- 9Matthews 1998. lo Kayip Zamalarzn Peinde.

This enormous effort was honored with first place in the national Turk- ish competition for the Henry Ford European Con- servation Award 1996-1997, given to volume 2. The ambitious Tiibinger Atlas des Vorderen Orients (TAVO) has recently been completed after more than two decades of study of the ancient Near East. A total of 296 maps, 130 supplement volumes, and 3 register volumes has been prepared, with 23 map sheets on geography and cultural anthropology, and 28 historical maps devoted wholly or partly to Asia Minor. A useful collection of geographically arranged chapters by various scholars and excavators on the status of research on the Neolithic in Tur- key has been assembled by editors M. Ozdogan and N. Basgelen.12 An overview on Anatolia-Bal- kan relations has also been recently published by S. Steadman.'3 In addition to these overviews, several topical studies also have appeared recently.

MIOCENE Pa,alar. Between 1996 and 1999 Berna Alpagut, in association with British and American colleagues, continued excavations at the important middle Miocene fossil deposit of Pa?alar southwest of Bur- sa. At 15 million years old, it is one of the oldest miocene deposits discovered in Turkey. The site revealed evidence for a mixed tropical and steppe environment providing for a variety of animals, in- cluding primates, classified as Sivanthropus. In the last few years, excavations have extended both north and east from those areas excavated previously and where the greatest thickness of fossil layers was reached, before fading out towards the northeast, causing a sharp decrease in the number of fossils.

Hominoids were represented mainly by teeth and fragments of the postcranial skeleton. Anchithe- ria, small mammals, rhinoceros, hippopotamus, and remains of two different elephant species are rep- resented in smaller numbers. Since 1996, a selec- tion of representative faunal specimens have been placed on display in the Bursa museum.20 (anklrl/Corakyerler. From 1997 to 1999 the Canklrl Museum, supported by a team from Ankara University led by Ayla Sevim, carried out rescue excavations at the upper Miocene site Gorakyerler. The fossil-bearing sediments cut during the con- struction of the Qankrli-Yaprakll road had earlier been observed and reported by the Candlr excava- tion team. Excavations revealed remains of a rich late Miocene fauna dating to 10 mya, one of the less well known periods in Turkey. The species repre- sented include giraffes, bovids, suids, cervids, two types of rhinoceros, equids, and elephants.2" Gandir. Excavations at the rich middle Miocene fossil beds of Candlr continued under the direction of E. Gulec. During 1996 and 1997, research focused on two slope sites, sites one and three, from the 1950s investigations by MTA. Both sites had originally been located in a different ecological niche, which was also reflected in the faunal assemblages. Site three, located on a steep slope, originally lay in a wooded environment close to a lake. Here, the majority of animal bones belonged to lacustrine species, espe- cially artiodactyls. In contrast, site one had fewer ar- tiodactyls but more carnivores and cervidae. Much attention was paid to the complete discov- ery of fossils from the earlier MTA excavation dump from site three, and the use of continous water- screening helped to add many smaller fossil re- mains to the collection.22 Sinap Formation. Salvage excavations in the Si- nap Formation continued in 1996-1997, sponsored by the Museum of Anatolian Civilisations in Anka- ra and under the guidance of Berna Alpagut, work- ing with an international group of specialists. More than 100 fossil localities, identified in the past sev- en years by a systematic survey of northern Ankara province, now provide a unique biochronostratig- raphy ranging from 15 to 1 million years ago. Re- 2 Reports by B. Alpagut have appeared in KST19 (1998) 1- 15; KST21 (2000) 1-10. 21 A first report has appeared in KST21 (2000) 51-4. 22Annual reports appeared in KST19 (1998) 73-85 (season 1996); KST20 (1999) 55-62; KST21 (2000) 11-13. 23 For a brief summary of the results, see http:// cent investigations concentrated on site 12, where a second primate skull, identified as Ankara pithe- cus and uncovered in 1995, has now been dated to 9.8 mya. Continuous fieldwork recovered more Mi- ocene faunal remains comparable with the less well- preserved Pasalar material, but there were no fur- ther primate remains. The erection of official sign- posts around this large area will be very important for the future of this rich site by discouraging un- authorized digging. Conservation and restoration of the Ankara pithecus skull was completed in 1996, prior to being displayed in the Museum of Anato- lian Civilisations. The researchers noted that its teeth had different characteristics to those of the original Ankara pithecus, the Sinap primate skull found in the 1950s. A second focus for research was the Kavakdere area northwest of Yassi6ren. Here Neogene strata on top of the cliffs showed an increase in equidae, especially when compared to the slightly older site 12.23 Ozliice (Mugla). The Miocene fossil deposit Ozluce was once again investigated by B. Alpagut during 1995-1996. The excellent preservation of the faunal remains below a thick layer of mud makes this site an outstanding archaeological feature of the Aegean region. After clearing a slope of its for- est cover, a deep sounding was sunk to reveal the geostratigraphy of the site. Among the finds, an in- tact mammoth skull, complete with tusk, is particu- larly noteworthy. The immediate area around the fossil beds has already been declared a national park (Turolian Park), and a traveling exhibition will be sent to tour neighboring regions. PALEOLITHIC SakVagozii (Gaziantep) Regional Project. The regional survey of Paleolithic and Neolithic sites conducted by A. Garrad and his team in this crucial northern border of the Great Rift Valley continued. As was already evident following the first season's work, this region was extensively used during the Lower and Middle Paleolithic but seems to have been much less densely occupied during the Up- per Paleolithic.

GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING Karkamish Palaeolithic Survey. This survey, which focused on the Paleolithic occupation in the Karka- mish Dam rescue area and its immediate vicinity, was carried out over two seasons, in 1998 and 1999, on the eastern bank of the Euphrates.25 H. Tasklran and his team were able to document 35 findspots. Most of them were flat sites-workshops, stations, shelters-located on the higher old Euphrates ter- races, on the slopes of the eastern hills, or on hill- tops overlooking the valley. No Paleolithic sites were found on the lower river terraces. Only three sites were mound or slope sites. The majority of the finds date to the Lower and Middle Paleolithic, with a workshop area producing Levallois cores identified at Almuso Tepe. Upper Paleolithic sites could not be identified positively. Four sites might belong to the very end of the Upper Paleolithic or the Epipa- leolithic period. Birecik Palaeolithic Survey. A similar situation to that described above was encountered further upstream on the western side of the Euphrates. Here, three Paleolithic sites were located on the upper terraces between Horum Hyuik and Belkis, which have been described in detail by L. Bourgui- gnon and C. Kuzucuoglu.26 Ucaglzll Magarasl. Excavations in the important Upper Paleolithic cave site of Uc;agizll Magarasl on the southern slope of the Samandagl were resumed in 1998 as part of a larger Samandagi research project, under the codirection of E. Gulec and S.L. Kuhn and in cooperation with Hatay Museum. The new investigations began in the northern part of the cave, where the partly collapsed roof left only limited space for excavation. Here, previous re- search had focused on the southern area. Three cultural layers could be distinguished. On top, only remaining along the sides of the cave, badly pre- served Epipaleolithic remains were found. The in- ventory of this layer included evidence for early Epipaleolithic industry with micro Gravette points and shell ornaments. Fish and shellfish, in addi- tion to landliving mammals, were found. The sec- ond cultural layer contained a stone wall surround- ing an ashy area, which might have been a grass- covered resting place. The early Upper Paleolithic material (35000-31000 B.P. cal.) shows an eastern Gravette component and is dominated by blades and bidirectional cores, with endscrapers and points comparable to Ksar Akil 17-16 and to the so- 25 For a preliminary report on the 1998 season, see H.

More than 500 shell beads were recovered from this deposit, and grinding and pounding stones bear traces of ochre and reflect an interest in decorative materials. The lowermost layer reached belonged to the begin- ning of the Upper Paleolithic (41000-39000 B.P. cal.) and was characterized by a flake industry with endscrapers on flakes, large points, and unidirec- tional blade cores based on Levallois technology. This is comparable to the early Aurignacian from Ksar Akil 21-20. Only few shell ornaments were found. A human premolar from the same level was also recorded. Karain and Okuzini. Excavations in Karain cave continued into their second decade under the di- rectorship of I. Yalclnkaya, who plays host to an in- ternational team of prehistorians and archaeome- try specialists. Investigations continued in the un- excavated parts of the main chamber E ("K6kten Hall") and, since 1997, in chamber B. Archaeometric analysis of stalagmites from the Middle Paleolithic geological layer II indicated that a humid and warm climate had existed, and this layer could be dated to 120,000-110,000 B.C. The underlying geological layer III revealed a sequence of superimposed living floors and hearths. Several Neanderthal bone fragments, a lower jaw, a broken femur and finger bones, and parts of a mammoth skeleton were retrieved from this layer. Faunal re- mains of hippopotamus were sampled for electron spin resonance (ESR) analysis, and these gave a date for layer III of 200,000 B.C. The lithic industry shows the well-known characteristics of the Karain Mousterian, with emphasis on Levallois technolo- gy and denticulated pieces. Excavations in chamber B revealed two distinct Epipaleolithic and one Middle Paleolithic layer, under a thin cover of Holocene disturbance. Par- ticularly noteworthy from the epipaleolithic level is an accumulation of debitage and a concentra- tion of butchering debris with cutmarks on the bones. The lithics include a variety of endscrapers, points, and prismatic cores. Besides bone awls, beads made from shell and dentalium were abun- dant. Radiocarbon dates for these Epipaleolithic layers fall into the 17th to 19th millennium B.P. (uncal.) range.27 The same team continued excavations at Okiuzi- ni where Epipaleolithic stratigraphy fills the chro- 26 In Anatolia Antiqua 7 (1999) 265-83. 27 For recent summaries, see KST18 (1997) 1-10; KST 19 (1998) 17-45; KST20 (1999) 23-37; KST21 (2000) 15-28. 470 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY nological gap between the Epipaleolithic layers at Karain and the beginning of the Holocene. The lithics here revealed examples of monopolar pris- matic cores and nongeometric microliths of distinc- tive types, which may be related to the Zagros Epi- paleolithic. Intrusive graves from the Chalcolithic and Roman periods are concentrated next to the cave's entrance and disturb its upper layers.28 Yarlmburgaz Magarasi. G.

In 1997, Michael Rosenberg embarked on a new research project on the aceram- ic site of Demirk6y in the lower Batman drainage. Preliminary results from the four soundings conduct- ed so far confirmed the hypothesis that Demirk6y would fill the chronological gap between the upper layers at Hallan Cemi and the basal occupation at (ay6nii. Two trenches revealed clusters of material but no features. It seems that this lowland site can be understood to be the relocation of the original Hallan Cemi population since these two sites are the only aceramic ones to be recorded in the Bat- man drainage. Similarities in the material culture of the two sites might indicate continuity, but there are also strong dissimilarities between the two. The most striking difference is a sharp drop in the use of obsidian, which shows that Demirk6y was appar- ently cut off from the obsidian distribution network that supplied Hallan Cemi. A major innovation was the use of sickle blades and of plastic material, both clay and bitumen, for the production of small ob- jects and probably for vessels and figurines. Intra- mural burials were another new feature, and these included one adult, one child, and one dog.30 C(ayonii. Several contributions on Cay6nii ap- peared in Light on Top of the Black Hill:31 E.

After preliminary soundings in 1995, Harald Hauptmann of the Ger- man Archaeological Institute in Istanbul and his field director Klaus Schmidt, in association with $anllurfa Archaeological Museum, began systemat- ic excavations at the stunning early Neolithic site Gobekli Tepe and the complementary site of Giircutepe. The ca. 15 m high tell of G6bekli Tepe marks one of the highest points of the Germis Daglarl, on the northern border of the Harran plain. A topo- graphic survey of the surrounding limestone pla- teau revealed many traces of Neolithic quarrying and unfinished or broken pieces, such as column bases, found in situ within 1 km of the site. Most remarkable is a 7 m long T-pillar with a 3 m wide head, which had been left in the quarry. Excavations concentrated on two areas of the tell. In the southern depression, the uppermost layer consisted of a building with six rectangular rooms, each room containing a pair of T-shaped pillars. This so-called Doppelpfeilergebdude (Double Pillar building) lay over an older building complex with curved dry stone walls. This had two building phas- es and relief pillars. This complex is called the Schlangenpfeilergebdude (Snake Pillar building), af- ter the relief on pillar one. A second pillar bears a relief of superimposed animals and another one of a jumping fox. Radiocarbon dates of 9200 b.p. for the Schlangenpfeilergebaude confirm that it is dated to the early aceramic Neolithic, therefore predating Nevali (ori. Parts of a later building adjacent to the Schlan- genpfeilergebaude were uncovered in 1999. One wall was formed by a semicircular row of relief pillars arranged around two central pillars, one of which has a pair of foxes in relief. The other pillars show a group of partridges, in front of which is probably a net and a boar. A terrazzo floor partly covers the fox reliefs, demonstrating that 3A summary on the 1997 season appeared in KST20 (1999) 249-57 and in Anatolica 24 (1998) 195-201. 31 Arsebiuk et al. 1999. 32 See TUBA-AR 2 (1999) 139-53.

GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING the relief pillar must belong to an earlier phase of the building, which will be excavated in the next season. Another building excavated on the southeastern summit is younger and represents the latest build- ing layer on the site. It consists of a rectangular room with dry stone walls, in parts preserved up to the roof, and two pairs of T-head pillars arranged symmetrically inside. Within the walls, numerous earlier pillar fragments had been reused. Two of the central pillars bear reliefs of a jumping lion, and therefore the building is dubbed the Lowen- pfeilergebdude (Lion Pillar building). Its floor was made from a terrazzo plaster. A picture of a wom- an-the only female representation found so far- incised on the sill between two pillars is thought to be secondary. Lithics are characterized by PPNA (Khiam, Helwan, and Aswad points) and early PPNB (Nemrik, Byblos, and Nevali Cori points) forms. Ground stone tools include incised stone vessels and pestles, double-hole spacer beads, and buttons with a diagonally pierced handle. Faunal remains derive entirely from wild animals such as aurochs, gazelles, wild pigs, foxes, and onagers. So far, no botanical remains could be retrieved. An important step toward the protection of these important Neolithic remains in situ was taken in 1999 when the moveable roofs were constructed. These now cover a total area of 300 m2. On the Harran plain, Gurcutepe I-IV is a cluster of four shallow mounds lined up along a perennial watercourse. All four mounds were tested with soundings, revealing evidence for an extensive late PPNB settlement on all four mounds with no indi- cations of earlier or later occupation, except for intrusive late Roman tombs on mound II. Investi- gations focused on the highest of these mounds, mound II, which stands 6 m above the level of the plain. Two layers of rectangular buildings with in- ternal subdivisions built from pis6 walls, some of which have stone foundations, were unearthed. One massive building stood out from the others because of the use of orthostats. Soundings on mound III also revealed traces of rectangular build- ings. On mound I, a clay platform with central hearth and roasting pits was uncovered. The lithic inventory comprises Cay6nii tools and sickle blades as well as Byblos and Palmyra points, therefore suggesting a date later than G6bekli Tepe, 33 Initial preliminary reports appeared in MDOG 130 (1998) 17-49 and IstMitt 48 (1998) 5-78. A catalogue of the sculp- tures is published in IstMitt49 (1999) 5-21 and a further dis- somewhere in the late aceramic Neolithic period. The spectrum of faunal remains is much more re- stricted than that of G6bekli Tepe, and domesticat- ed sheep and goat occur. Therefore, the two sites illustrate two different stages in the evolution of ag- riculture: G6bekli Tepe is an early Neolithic site used by a complex hunter-gatherer society with a strong religious belief system. Gurciitepe, in contrast, seems to have belonged to a fully sedentary Neolithic com- munity that was familiar with all aspects of early agri- culture and animal husbandry.33 Akarcay. Akarcay Tepe is a shallow Neolithic set- tlement mound on an alluvial terrace on the east- ern side of the Euphrates within the Karkamish Dam rescue area. Salvage excavations by a Turkish- Spanish-Japanese team began in 1998 under the scientific coordination of Istanbul University, to- gether with the Universities of Barcelona and Tsukuba, and revealed a long Neolithic cultural sequence. Today, Akarcay Tepe appears as a single elongat- ed mound rising 6 m above the level of the alluvial terrace. Apparently, the site consists of two mounds, with an older aceramic occupation in the east, from where the settlement later expanded toward the west, where a second mound formed. Excavations on the eastern mound have revealed three layers of aceramic architecture. The oldest building, build- ing G, was a rectangular mudbrick building with internal buttress walls that had been completely emptied at the time of its abandonment. The next stage was represented by a circular wall fragment that runs under the foundations of building B in the upper layer. The upper phase consisted of two rectangular single-roomed buildings (B and C) with stone walls and a third small single-roomed build- ing (E) that had massive walls. In the fill of build- ings E and C, and over the open area, flat limestone fragments with incised patterns were found. On the western mound, the oldest pottery Neolithic occupation phases are represented by hardened surfaces, pits and postholes, and open- air working areas found in the stratigraphic sound- ing. The preserved architecture of the upper layer of the larger squares consists of two multiroom build- ings (A and F), each of which had cell-like internal divisions, separated by a corridor. The walls are made from mudbrick, with stone foundations lim- ited to the outer walls only. A combined chrono- cussion of the art is found in TUBA-AR 3 (2000) 1-14. For a general assessment of the Neolithic in the Urfa region, see Hauptmann 1999. 472 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY stratigraphy of the site has now defined six settle- ment phases. The earliest phases (VI to IV) corre- spond to the middle to late PPNB and are charac- terized by bipolar blades and Byblos points made from local flint. These types decrease in number towards the end of the PPNB, when pottery is intro- duced gradually with the characteristic "Black se- ries" in phase III. Probably following a gap in the sequence, the full PN is represented by series of coarse ware and thick-walled fine ware in phase II. Phase I shows a variety of fine wares with paint and incised/impressed decoration and a coarse ware with heavy chaff temper that includes husking trays.34 Mezraa Teleilat. The shallow mound of Mezraa Teleilat is located 5 km south of Birecik on the left bank of the Euphrates within the Karkamish res- cue area. Since rescue excavations under the di- rection of M. Ozdogan began in 1998, the site has produced a long stratigraphic sequence for the Neolithic period. The topography of the site underwent massive alterations when its northern part was leveled for irrigation. Consequently, excavations concentrated on the southern part of the mound, where an area of 1600 m2 was exposed over 10 trenches and 2 soundings. The unexpected results from these trenches once again show how misleading surface data can be. Even though no Iron Age material had been recorded during the systematic surface col- lection in 1998, the upper building level proved to be a monumental Iron Age building with three building phases that had been completely emptied before its abandonment. Below the Iron Age layers (cultural layer I), a thick deposit of Pottery Neolith- ic debris layers (cultural layer IIA1-4) without any architectural remains was encountered. Late Neolithic buildings might, however, have existed in the area still covered by the Iron Age building or might have been cut away when the area was lev- eled off for the construction of that building. The four phases distinguished within the 2 m of Pottery Neolithic deposit provide a comprehensive picture of the pottery development from the beginning to the late Neolithic-Halaf transition. The pottery com- bines impressed and painted decoration and can be compared with both Mediterranean and Anato- lian sites. The lowermost PN layer, IIA4, is charac- terized by coarse chaff-tempered fabrics, to which finer fabrics are added in the later layers. Layer 34For a summary of the 1998 season, see N. Balkan-Atli, A. Erim-Ozdogan, and M.

In layer IIA2b/a, an emphasis on red paint used for linear and simple geometric pattern re- placed the earlier impresso-dominated assemblage. Dark monochrome vessels with burnished surfac- es form a second group characteristic for this layer. Husking trays and incised Hassuna-related frag- ments occur in IIA2a. Layer IIAl's orange colored pottery with shiny red paint is thought to represent the transition to Halaf. Below this deposit of PN debris layers, the pre- ceeding occupation (layer IIB, considered PPN- PN transitional) was represented by four rectangu- lar multiroomed buildings. The walls, built in the dry stone technique, were preserved up to 1 m high. The upper part, which was not preserved, might have consisted of mudbrick. The interior of the houses was divided into small cells probably form- ing a substructure for an upper living floor, which has not survived. Open courtyards were used as open-air working areas, and knapping workshops were recorded between the houses. A group of stone vessels was found in one room. True PPN layers (layer IIC) could only be inves- tigated in two limited soundings. The architecture uncovered in these layers had the same orienta- tion as that in the succeeding layer, but it is con- structed from larger stones probably as a result of a different layout with larger rooms.35 Central Anatolia Kaletepe/Komurcii. After several seasons of sur- vey work on obsidian sources in Cappadocia had allowed the identification of several Neolithic work- shop areas, N. Balkan-Atli and M.-C1. Cauvin togeth- er with a Turkish-French team set off in 1996 to systematically survey and excavate one of these work- shops at K6mircu-Kaletepe, high on a slope north of G6lludagl. Work began with the cleaning of a river-cut sec- tion where more than 6 m of stratified deposits con- taining obsidian debitage could be traced. Radio- carbon samples from this section suggest a date of 4800-4600 B.C. (cal.) for the uppermost and of 8000 B.C. (cal.) for the lowermost layer. Therefore, the earliest Neolithic use of the place can be dated to the middle PPNB. Soundings on the slope above revealed different Neolithic knapping areas dis- ica Antiqua 8 (2000) 227-55. 35 For a summary of the 1998 investigations, see M. Ozdogan, A. Ayhan, and A. Demirta5 in Tuna and Ozturk 1999, 11-9. A 1999 season report is planned for vol. 2 of this series. 473 2001]</page><page sequence="12">ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING tributed over a wider area. Since 1998, work has concentrated on the section of a former earth quar- ry and adjacent trenches close to a rock outcrop further south. Here, knapping workshops of mid- dle and late PPNB date were found stratigraphical- ly superposed on one another. A row of stones aligned north-south in the top part of the trench might have been a wall for a shelter, erected around a knapping place. The lower levels produced pale- olithic finds directly on bedrock. Interestingly, the Neolithic obsidian industry, which was based on naviform cores and bipolar technology, differs com- pletely from contemporary production at Asikli H6yiik. According to Balkan-Atli, Kaletepe shows relations with the technological traditions of east- ern sites such as Mureybit, Halula, and Dja'de, rath- er than with Asikli H6yuk.36 AMlkl Hoyiik. U. Esin from Istanbul University completed a decade of salvage excavations at the outstanding aceramic site Aikli H6yfik, on the east bank of the Melendiz River. A large exposed area of more than 4000 m2 has given insight into the settlement layout of the upper layer 2, which is ra- diocarbon dated to 8000 B.C. Work continued in the step trench on the north- eastern edge of the mound, where a sequence of 10 rebuilding phases from layer 2 and three fur- ther phases for layer 3 could be distinguished be- fore virgin soil was reached. A silt layer between layers 2 and 3 indicates flooding between these two phases. The architecture seems to follow the same principles from the beginning of the settlement, without major changes. On the northeastern side of the mound, the continuation of the huge enclo- sure wall, made from tufa, and a probable gate was unearthened; however, no traces of an enclosure wall were found in the southeastern part of the site. One building in the southwestern quarter, which was remarkable for its extraordinary layout, has now been fully exposed. In it, extremely broad walls were constructed from dry stone in a casemate tech- nique, surrounding a large square courtyard. Its floor was carefully paved and traces of red and yel- low paint were preserved. This building is believed to have had a religious function. 36Annual reports appeared in KST20 (1999) 1-21; KST21 (2000) 41-50.

The raw material was brought to the site as complete blocks and all further knapping was carried out at Aikli it- self. A major difference between layers 2 and 3 is the significant number of microliths in the lower layer.7 To further protect the site, an open-air museum is being planned, in which the excavated areas on the top part of the mound will be conserved in situ and open to visitors. Musular. Since 1996, Aksaray Museum, with the scientific assistance of M. (zbasaran from Istanbul University, has conducted excavations at the flat Neolithic site Musular. The settlement is located opposite Ailkh Hoyiik on the west bank of the Me- lendiz River on a slightly sloping tufa outcrop, which was partly terraced to provide a secure base for the settlement. Two phases of occupation and a third mixed surface layer have been distinguished. In the northern part of the settlement, only aceramic Neolithic layers have been exposed. In the central part, aceramic Neolithic remains are overlain by substantial late Neolithic architecture. The aceram- ic Neolithic settlement took advantage of pits and depressions in the bedrock and is therefore much better preserved than the later Neolithic layers. In the central area of the settlement, rectangular buildings of the aceramic phase could be traced by their carefully prepared red painted and burnished plaster floors. The upper walls were probably con- structed from mudbrick. In the northern part of the settlement, no complete buildings were preserved, but fragmentary surfaces and carefully set pebble con- centrations are found. These might have been pit floors or roasting pits. The obsidian industry was based on bipolar blades and had two different traditions, one related to Kaletepe, the other one to Aikll. Dom- inant types are scrapers and leaf-shaped projectiles made by pressure flaking. Few specimens of Byblos points were found. The lithics analysis points to a date that is contemporary with the late occupation at Aiklh, or slightly later, and which is now confirmed by a se- ries of four radiocarbon dates falling into the range 8420 + 110 to 7980 + 220 B.P.

Faunal and paleobotanic remains in- dicate a fully developed village economy with sheep, goat, and cattle husbandry in which a variety of cere- als, pulses, and fruits were exploited. The architecture of the upper layer consists of a massive stone building with several rooms and a massive wall to the east, constructed from extraor- dinarily large limestone blocks. Gaps between these blocks were filled with smaller limestone pieces and tufa fragments. A long stone wall with a careful- ly built outer surface and an irregular inner sur- face was exposed on the slope east of the building. Two burials lay on the western side of this wall. Finds from this layer consist of monochrome burnished pottery vessels in simple shapes, straight sided open bowls, and short necked globular jars with almost no decoration. Ozbasaran compares them to mate- rial from K6ok H6yuk, Can Hasan I, Guvercinkayasl, and Gelveri, thereby indicating a date toward the end of the Neolithic or the beginning of the Chal- colithic period.38 Catalh6yiik. Continuous work at (atalh6yiik came to an apogee in a six-month season from April to October 1999. The intensive agricultural irrigation of the Cumra plain had caused a major drop of the groundwater table, thereby threatening the earli- est cultural deposits at the site with dehydration. Archaeological research was therefore concentrat- ed on the site's earliest settlement layers. Conser- vation measures to prevent further dehydration include the construction of an irrigation trench surrounding the site that is expected to stabilize the groundwater level in this area. North of the mound a bulldozer trench ("Kopal area") was cut to reveal traces of the earliest off-site occupation. The lowermost level revealed an irreg- ular lake marl surface with pits created by systemat- ic quarrying of the lake marl. A layer of rubbish deposits overlay these quarry pits. Surprising results were obtained from a restrict- ed part of the southern "Mellaart area": below the lowest level reached by Mellaart, which is now ra- diocarbon dated to 7500 B.C., the earliest occupa- 38 For a summary on the 1996 season, see Ara4ST 15 (1998) 199-217; on the skeletons, ArkST13 (1998) 161-73; a report on the 1998 season appeared in KST21 (2000) 81-92.

For a flash on the 1999 season results, see Science tion layers were reached at a much higher level than had been expected. Therefore the beginning of the Neolithic settlement at Catalh6yfik must be dated later than was previously thought. The low- est occupation layers had traces of occasional fires and traces of lime preparation directly above the lake marl. As in the Kopal area, the lake marl had been quarried. These areas were periodically flood- ed by the Carsamba River. According to S. Farid, the lithics from the lowest occupation are comparable with the microlithic assemblage from Aikli. No pot- tery is found in these layers. In the upper layers of the Mellaart area more build- ings of the pottery Neolithic levels VII and VI were exposed. A fragment of a wall painting with a dia- mond pattern-the first wall painting to be found since the excavations were resumed in 1995-was preserved in building 2. The same building also yield- ed small obsidian hoards next to the oven area. From the superimposed buildings 6 and 17, a number of child burials in baskets woven from wild grass were reported. Grass pollen from the basket residues ap- pears to indicate a time of death in late spring. On the northern summit of the mound, excava- tions in the "Bach area" continued with further work on building 3. This is a two room building with one big and one small room and a total of seven platforms. Directly on the floor two human skulls and a bucrani- um were found. Traces of red wall paint were pre- served in a corner. A great deal of emphasis was placed on conserva- tion and protection measures. The wall painting frag- ment and one of the child burials were conserved for display at the Konya museum. On the summit, a moveable tent and a visitor's gallery were erected over the remains of house 5. This allows visitors to see an open trench year-round and it can be moved to another position in future, if necessary.39 LATE NEOLITHIC AND CHALCOLITHIC Southeastern Anatolia and Cilicia Ziyaret Tepe.

During the 1996 to 1999 sea- sons, excavations at Arslantepe, directed by M. Fran- gipane, focused on the Chalcolithic periods VIII- VIA and on an EB I chamber tomb that belongs to early period VIB (see figs. 4-7). Most importantly, buildings that illustrate the transition from VII to VIA through their successive building stages have been uncovered. Modest domestic houses of period VIII with some in situ material were unearthed on the lower ter- race on the northwest part of the mound. Under the floors, two intramural child burials had been deposited in jars. One room stands out because of its thicker walls, which included a niche. Traces of wall painting are preserved on the plaster. Period VIII diagnostic pottery is characterized by a large amount of bowls with scraped outer surfaces, which appear to be related to the well-known Coba Hoyiuk type, and by a special variety of incised pottery. Ra- diocarbon dates obtained from the buildings place them between 4300 and 4000 B.C. (cal.), that is, at the end of the Ubaid period or the transition to the late Chalcolithic period. Architectural remains of period VII/VIA have been uncovered in two areas of the western mound. On the upper terrace, three long rectangular rooms have been unearthed. All were in use over a considerable period of time as the floors of the buildings were renewed. The pottery assemblag- es found on the succeeding floors clearly illus- trate the transition from VII to VIA. Red-black bur- nished ware with transcaucasian traits makes its first appearance on the upper floors, thereby firm- ly dating the first transcaucasian contacts at Ar- slantepe to the end of VII or the very beginning of VIA. Small finds from this area include obsidian arrowheads, steatite pestles, and numerous beads, probably from a workshop context. More evidence for the VII-VIA transition comes from an area fur- ther to the west, where a monumental building of the well-known two-room type, so far the oldest public building found in Arslantepe, has been un- covered. Pottery on the floor consisted of hun- dreds of string cut base bowls that had been turned over and piled in huge stacks, together with a few red-slipped vessels.

Wattenmaker in cooperation with $anhurfa Museum, concentrated mainly on the third-millennium B.C. urban expansion layers, sum- marized below. The wide distribution of Halaf pot- tery over large areas of the lower town had already been noticed during earlier survey work, and the site has since been listed as one of the major Halaf centers. In 1996-1997, four soundings in the south- eastern part of the third-millennium B.C. lower town and a fifth sounding toward the southwest were dug in order to test this assumption. The later sounding revealed evidence for a late Neolithic occupation apparently located next to an ancient watercourse.

The four soundings in the southeast- ern quarter of the outer town revealed a partially preserved tholos of late Halaf date and a series of paved pebble floors. Wall fragments and unconnect- ed surfaces were also encountered. Drill samples taken from the bottom of one sounding indicate that there are another 3.5 m of cultural deposits, sug- gesting a considerable length of occupation.42 Tilbes Hoyiik. This Spanish-Turkish project be- gan in 1996 under the direction ofJ.G. Fuensanta of Alicante University and Adnan Misir of Urfa Muse- um. J.G. Fuensanta reports on the 1996 season: Tilbes is the largest mound to be flooded on the Urfa bank of the Euphrates River and has remains that are critical to explaining a number of interest- ing cultural-historical issues. The Tilbes Salvage Project is focused on the fourth and third millennia B.C., and this research emphasizes the Ubaid/pre- Late Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age periods. One intensive survey was performed on the high mound and the area surrounding it. The 1996 trenches and soundings were focused on two different areas of the mound: the west area (sector A) and the south area (sector E). The proposed goals of the season were to get stratigraphic and chronological contexts from the Tilbes occupation. Any Ubaid occupation was revealed during the 1996 work but a long fourth- millennium occupation is also in evidence. The ear- liest Early Bronze Age appears to be one of the most important settlement periods at Tilbes. The late Early Bronze Age and beginning of the Middle Bronze Age could be one of the larger periods rep- resented at Tilbes and the surrounding area. After the 1996 work, a mid first-millennium B.C. occupa- tion (presumed Achaemenid/Hellenistic) appears to be of particular interest. The Spanish-Turkish team was joined in 1997 by M. Rothman and continued with excavations at Tilbes and soundings at the neighboring mounds of Tilvez, Tilobuir, and Tilmusa until 1999, prior to the area becoming flooded in the spring of 2000. The combined results point to a massive Early and Middle Bronze Age occupation at Tilbes, preced- ed by Halaf and late Chalcolithic layers. Much later, most of these mounds were resettled during the later Iron Age and used until the Roman period.43 42Annual reports appeared in KST18 (1997) 81-91.

Salvage excavations at Horum Hoyfik, located in the Birecik Dam rescue area, were completed in 1999, and the site was flooded in the spring of 2000. C. Marro and A. Tibet from the French Research Institute in cooperation with R. Ergec and F. Bulgan from Gaziantep Museum con- centrated on the excavation of Early and Middle Bronze Age remains on the eastern slope (discussed below). On the upper part of the mound, considerable Medieval remains were found and excavated. These had, unfortunately, disturbed some of the underly- ing stratigraphy, but at the base of the mound, on the eastern side, it was possible to make a sounding that included a deep feature (probably a large well) that was cut through the original alluvial terracing. Here, Chalcolithic remains were encountered in and next to the presumed well that had been dug down to the water table, a total depth of 6.6 m. Ap- parently, all earlier (pre-third millennium) occu- pation in this part of the Euphrates valley had been destroyed by river erosion when the Euphrates changed its course sometime during the Holocene. The well is therefore the only remaining vestige of a pre-Bronze Age occupation at Horum Hoyuk. Lat- er, during the fourth millennium, it became filled with tell soil, possibly because it was no longer in use because of a change in the Euphrates. Chaff- tempered pottery and painted pottery of Amuq D- F type as well as late Halaf painted pottery and stamp seals were collected from this fill. The pottery was a mixture of chaff-tempered and painted wares. The painted wares tended to be thinner (Halaf and northern Ubaid). The chaff-tempered wares were coarser and possibly ranged across the Ubaid into the Ubaid/Uruk transition. There was no chrono- logical order to the pit filling, and all the pottery was mixed within the different time periods.44 Hacmebi Tepesi. Rescue excavations carried out by G. Stein at the late Chalcolithic site of Hacinebi Tepesi were completed in 1997 after six seasons of fieldwork. A long indigenous development of the late Chalcolithic settlement ("precontact" phases A- B1) has become clear, whereas contact with the Uruk world only occurs towards the very end of the late Chalcolithic occupation ("contact phase" B2).

Apparently, many structures associated with the lifestyle of a complex society were already well developed by the earlier part of the site's occupation. An enclosure wall, in parts preserved up to a height of 3 m, must have encircled the settlement from the early phases of its occupation. Adjacent workshop areas with evidence of copper processing were uncovered in the south- east trench. A sequence of huge platforms that also date to the early phase of occupation were exposed in the northern trench. During phase B2, small mudbrick houses with Uruk material were erected next to the platform. The western trench revealed three adjacent mudbrick buildings next to a large courtyard. The mound was abandoned at the end of the Middle Uruk period but was reused as a burial ground during the EB I period. Four stone cist graves exposed in the northern trench had the characteris- tic "champagne cups" known from other cemeteries in the Birecik-Karkamish area.45 Fistdkl Hoyiik. S. Pollock and R. Bembeck from the State University of New York at Binghamton report: Fistikli H6yik is located on the eastern edge of the Euphrates River floodplain, approximately 4 km south of the modern town of Birecik. It is small, low mound of approximately 0.5 ha and a maximum height of some 4 m. Work at Flstikll H6yuik is being conducted as part of the Karkamish Dam salvage project, coordinated by N. Tuna of METU. The site was occupied principally in the earlier part of the Halaf period and was again used in Late Hellenis- tic/Roman times. The 1999 excavations revealed portions of four tholoi, two small round buildings, and part of a cell- plan building. All of the structures were construct- ed of pis6, mostly built atop substantial stone foun- dations. The small round buildings had very hard, baked clay floors, whereas the tholoi seem mostly to have had more ephemeral, compact silt surfaces. Exterior surfaces were frequently littered with arti- facts and animal bones, a striking contrast to the generally clean interiors of buildings. In several cases, there was evidence of repairs of walls, indicated by small sections that consisted of pis6 of a different texture or color than the remain- der of the wall. These indications of repair, along with the presence of superimposed floors in some 45 Annual reports appeared in KST18 (1997) 93-120; KST 19 (1998) 179-207; KST20 (1999) 183-213.

An SAA conference session buildings, suggest that these structures were used for some time. On the other hand, there is evidence for only one major building level in almost all of the excavated units, indicating a relatively brief duration of use for the site as a whole. In addition to architecture and exterior surfaces, our excava- tions encountered two large, deep middens in dif- ferent parts of the site. Both date to the Halaf occu- pation of the settlement. Halaf pottery from Fistikli includes both thick- walled, vegetal-tempered, unpainted wares that are frequently burnished in a casual manner and thin- walled, mineral-tempered, painted wares. On the basis of preliminary analysis, we see the best paral- lels for the painted assemblage in Sabi Abyad level 3. The chipped stone industry seems to be primari- ly flake-based, although blades are also present. The majority of the raw material used is locally available chert; obsidian contributes only a tiny proportion. In addition to a full range of chert debitage, the chipped stone assemblage includes retouched flakes and blades, borers/piercing tools, scrapers, denticulated and notched tools, transverse arrow- heads, and a very small number of sickle blades and burins. There is a large corpus of stone imple- ments used for grinding, pounding, and rubbing. Some were shaped deliberately, whereas others are river pebbles that were used with little or no fur- ther modification. Three complete and one bro- ken stone seals were recovered, along with a frag- ment of a sealing that bears a motif similar but not identical to one of the seals. Plant and animal remains are under study. The faunal remains include domesticated cattle, pigs, sheep, and goats, and wild species that include red deer and gazelle. Plant remains include einkorn wheat (Triticum monococcum), emmer wheat (Triti- cum dicoccum), and barley (Hordeum sativum). The site seems to have been abandoned some- time in the early part of the Halaf period and was not reoccupied for many millennia. When it was once again used, in Late Hellenistic to Roman times, it was mostly as a burial ground.46 Zeytinli Bahve Hoyuk. The first season of rescue excavations conducted by M. Frangipane and the Arslantepe team in 1999 revealed an unexpected- ly long occupation sequence for the late Chalcolith- ic to EB I periods and a conical monument of later focusing on Haclnebi is published in Paleorient 25 (1999). 46A report on the first season has appeared in Tuna and Oztirk 1999, 81-90; season 1999 will appear in vol. 2 of this series.

GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING date located on the northern part of the mound (see below). Zeytinli Bahce Hoyuk is the largest mound with- in the Karkamish Dam salvage area, located 4 km south of Birecik on the left bank of the Euphrates. It covers an area of ca. 2.6 ha and has an elongated oval shape. The western side slopes steeply over more than 14 m to the present level of the alluvial plain, indicating severe erosion caused by the Eu- phrates river, which today is located 700 m away to the west. The lower of the two trenches placed on this eroded section revealed a long sequence of building layers that seem to date to the late Chal- colithic-EB I transition, followed by three layers of EB I occupation. Another 6 m of EB I deposit sepa- rate the lower trench from the upper one where five layers of substantial EB I architecture have been uncovered over a larger area. Parallel to the excavation, an intensive survey, intended to support further research strategies, revealed evidence for noncontinuous occupation of the site in the Halaf period, the late Chalcolithic to Early Bronze Age, the Iron Age, and then later in Parthian-Roman to Medieval times.47 Yarlm Hoyuk. M. Rothman, in cooperation with Gaziantep Museum, carried out one season of res- cue excavations at the small, half-eroded site Yarlm H6yik, located within the Karkamish Dam salvage area on the western bank of the Euphrates. The site had been recorded during Algaze's 1993 survey as a Late Uruk-EB I settlement. Excavations proved the existence of at least two layers of scanty building, the remains of which were badly damaged by founda- tions and pits dug for a Hellenistic farmstead. Roth- man compares the material found in the upper pre- historic building phase to the Kurban V assemblage and dates the lower layer to the Late Uruk period.48 Tilbeshar. Late Chalcolithic remains from Til- beshar are mentioned below. Oylum Hoyuk. Engin Ozgen and his team from Hacettepe University have, since 1995, been joined by Barbara Helwing on behalf of the Ger- man Archaeological Institute in Istanbul. During the 1996 to 1999 seasons, Chalcolithic and Bronze Age remains were exposed in two different areas of the mound. 47A report on preliminary surveys has been published by A. Deveci and Y. Mergen in Tuna and Ozturk 1999, 97-112; the report on the 1999 season is scheduled to appear in the sec- ond volume of this series. 48A report appeared in KST 19 (1998) 277-90. For a full report, see Anatolica 24 (1998) 65-99. 49An extensive preliminary report on the work carried out On the eastern slope, directly below the step trench at the base of the mound, two soundings have been opened revealing evidence for a middle Chalcolithic-Amuq E occupation. Architectural remains were badly preserved and most of the de- posits consisted of slope wash. Much better results came from three small sound- ings at the western base of the tell, which revealed architectural remains of LCH 1 and LCH 2 date separated by a thick erosion layer. The lowermost layer exposed consists of a massive wall standing five courses high with a backfill of stones and worn Ubaid pottery sherds probably deriving from an old- er tell. The purpose of this structure remains enig- matic. It might have been part of a terracing against occasional floods from the nearby Akpinar Suyu riv- er, or it might be part of a large platform construc- tion. The most characterstic pottery form in the occupation layers is the coba bowl. The upper lay- ers of the LCH 1 occupation include an open court- yard used as a domestic workshop, on the floor of which several inverted coba bowls, pestles with red pigment traces, and small flint cores were found. After an occupation gap, represented by massive slope erosion layers, a domestic house was con- structed during LCH 2. Its inventory includes cas- seroles and hammerhead profile bowls. Under the floor, a total of five burials have been found: three simple hocker burials, one extreme hocker, and a pithos burial.49 Domuztepe. Excavations at this amazing Halaf "megasite" continued as a joint project directed by S. Campbell and E. Carter until 1999. Four major areas (operations I to IV) were investigated with the main exposure in operation I. So far, three cul- tural phases have been distinguished by excavation, one of Late Halaf date and two that postdate the Halaf period. These latter are currently termed "Post-Halaf." The pottery from these phases resem- bles Halaf material in fabric and style but the deco- ration appears to borrow certain Ubaid traits. The earliest levels were uncovered in the sound- ing, operation II, where a bulldozer cut the south- eastern slope, exposing five layers. A building con- sisting of a rectangular room inside a round struc- ture forms one of the excavated layers. Later, this up to 1996 has been published in IstMitt47 (1997) 39-90. The Amuq E occupation below the step trench has also been re- corded in TAY 3-Chalcolithic.

The com- bination of tholos buildings with rectangular struc- tures can also be seen in the lowermost layer. Late Halaf pottery and stamp seals are among the arti- facts recovered (fig. 8). Operations III and IV on the northwestern slope revealed only fragmentary prehistoric architectural remains. Animal bones were found scattered between fragmentary walls in operation III. A tholos with a well preserved hearth was found and recorded in operation IV. The material from the fill slightly postdates the Late Halaf period. The latest phase was encoun- tered in operation I on the central mound, which is now the largest area to have been exposed. The uppermost phase here consists of a Medieval cem- etery. The uppermost prehistoric layer had two rectangular rooms with pis6 walls on stone foun- dations, adjacent to a central open area. East of this structure, a compound of four small tholoi was located (fig. 9). Below this building phase, a small tholos and parts of other structures were exposed. A pit with fine pure clay deposits is in- terpreted as a specialized structure for the leviga- tion of potter's clay. Below this, a burial pit con- taining the skulls of at least 30 individuals togeth- er with scattered long bones was found. The fill of this pit consists of ashy soil that may derive from a funeral ceremony that included a fire, even though the bones themselves do not show any signs of burning. Finally, another sounding, operation V, on the eastern side revealed plastered surfaces next to a rock concretion. Another project of the 1997 season was a control survey of areas where systematic surface collection had already taken place in 1995. This was carried out in order to better understand the erosion pro- cesses and artifact densities found on a tell site that is under constant cultivation.50 Amuq Valley Regional Project. Following in the footsteps of Braidwood's famous Amuq Project, the Oriental Institute's mission headed by A. Yener took on several projects in the region. T. Wilkinson and T. Harrison continued their systematic survey projects of the Amuq plain, iden- tifying both previously known sites as well as new ones. A total of 237 sites have been recorded, an increase of 50 new sites on the number recognized by Braidwood. The discovery of previously unknown third-millennium B.C. sites on the limestone pla- teaux east of the plain was one important outcome of the survey. New information on the environmen- tal history of the area now allows us to recognize shifts in the course of the ancient river and subse- quent changes in settlement locations.

A visit was paid by members of MTA and Bogazlcl University to third-millennium B.C. mining areas in the Amanus mountains where arsenopyrite and chalcopyrite veins were documented at one of the Kisecik mines. Tell Kurdu. After some test soundings in 1996, excavations at the huge Chalcolithic double mound Tell Kurdu were resumed in 1998 in response to massive bulldozing of the site. A magnetometer sur- vey carried out on the larger parts of the site has revealed evidence for large building structures on the northern slope and pottery kilns on the eastern slope. On the northern mound, soundings were dug in 1998 where several burials from an Ubaid peri- od cemetery and the remains of a multiroomed building were uncovered. During the following season, two trenches were sunk into the western part of a building that had been located by magne- tometry. A series of rooms bordering a large court- yard were uncovered. Three of the walls were ex- tremely thick; they had been constructed from pise, and some of them had an outer mudbrick shell and an interior white plaster finish. Installa- tions such as ovens and benches were found in the building. Material associated with this build- ing consists of Dark Burnished Wares and the lo- cal, Halaf-related Amuq C material. A sounding on the eastern edge of the mound revealed a building with storage bins that overlay a partly uncovered round building with internal but- tresses. Pottery on the floor dated from the Ubaid/ Amuq E period. A step trench on the eastern side of the southern mound revealed a sequence of slop- ing ash and trash deposits running up against a partly preserved building. A rich harvest of seal- ings, tokens, figurine fragments, and beads was obtained from these trash deposits, which must be dated to the Amuq E period. Also on the eastern slope, an industrial area with pottery kilns was also located by the magnetometer survey. The excavations that followed, across a 20 x 20 m trench, unearthed a series of kilns and wast- ers around an open courtyard. Three square and one round kiln were excavated, but more kilns are preserved in this area. The number of kilns and the amount of ceramic slag and wasters points to pottery production on a large scale, clearly out- stretching production on a household level. Stone pestles and mortars with iron ore staining are prob- ably related to the production of pigments used for painting the pottery. On the southern summit, a large pis6 building, with storage rooms that had a raised floor on a "grill- 482 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY like" arrangement of walls, and an adjacent platform were uncovered. Administrative items such as tokens, stamp seals, and sealings were found on the floor. Soundings dug on the northern saddle and in selected areas at the base of the southern mound helped to clarify the topography of the site, which turned out to be smaller than was previously thought. The size of the Amuq E settlement is now estimated to be only 2-3 ha, and it seems that Braidwood's orig- inal estimate based on the depth of deposit on his trench I was greatly exaggerated by large amounts of slope wash. No Amuq E is found on the northern mound where Amuq D remains were encountered directly under the surface of the mound. T.J. Wilkinson and A. Yener point out the possi- bility that Tell Kurdu, together with the roughly contemporary 24 ha site Tell 'Imar, 2 km further south, might once have formed one large center on both banks of the Afrin river.51 Kinet Hoyuk. Halaf sherds were collected from Medieval pits on the eastern terrace. The finds, which were subsequently redeposited in the Medi- eval pits, are thought to belong to a prehistoric oc- cupation on the eastern terrace.52 For later periods at this site, see below. Mersin/Yumuktepe. Investigations of the joint Turkish-Italian mission codirected by V. Sevin and I. Caneva at Yumuktepe/Mersin achieved new re- sults that further our understanding of the site's topography. Using satellite images, important Ho- locene geomorphological changes could be traced, and the ancient course of the Efrenk river east of the settlement could be established. It seems that neotectonic movements in this tectonically active area were responsible for the shift in the course of the river. The altered site topography has important con- sequences for understanding the settlement lay- out. Access to the prehistoric site was probably from the plain toward the west, from where the mound rose gently toward the east. Tracing the overlap- ping late Neolithic and middle Chalcolithic ter- races in trench A on the western slope and in trench K on the south confirmed this hypothesis. This al- lowed the ancient contours of the prehistoric mound, which had apparently been small and shal- '1 The annual field reports that appear in the Oriental Insti- tute News and Notes are now available online at http://www- oi.uchicago.edu/OI/PROJ/AMU/Kurdu.html.

Also, the orientation of the Chalcolithic defenses uncovered by Garstang made use of the natural protection provided by the river to the east. Excavations continued in three major areas. On the western slope, the new trenches south of Garstang's trench A produced further architectural remains of middle and late Neolithic date. The multiroomed building dating to phase XXVI or slightly earlier, which had already been excavated in the 1995 season, could now be completely exposed. It consisted of several rectangular rooms connected by a corridor. A previously uncovered cell structure might belong to the same phase and may be inter- preted as an annex, possibly for storage purposes. Two large conglomerate blocks flanked the entrance of the building. A button-shaped seal with geomet- ric incisions found in these layers recalls similar ex- amples from Sabi Abyad. The late Neolithic layers are now distinguished into two subphases. In the lower subphase the architecture consists of massive stone walls with rounded corners. The second sub- phase revealed stone walls and a pebble platform with mudbricks on top, which is interpreted as a for- tification building dating to ca. 5800 B.C. Approxi- mately 800 years later, the foundation trenches of the middle Chalcolithic terrace wall cut these lay- ers. This terrace wall was partly eroded by the river. Adjacent to the terrace wall, house floors with in situ cooking pots and andirons were found. On top of the mound, Garstang's trench X was relocated and connected with the plans of the new trenches. Further excavation of the Chalcolithic "for- tress" in layer XVI uncovered another massive gate facing west. One new house unit adjacent to those previously exposed was unearthed. The tripartite house on the citadel now continues further to the west. The newly exposed room is a domestic unit. The Medieval fortification wall in area Z is now proven to have stood on top of an older mudbrick wall, which is now dated, according to pottery com- parisons with central Anatolia, to the late Hittite period. Outside this fortification wall was located a terraced settlement. Below this, further Middle Bronze Age levels were found.3 18/4-5 (1999) 555-71. 52 See KST20 (1999) 259-81. 53Annual reports appeared in KST 18 (1997) 23-41.

After systematically surveying the Nigde-Nevsehir-Aksaray triangle for several seasons, Sevil Gulcur set out to excavate at Gfivercinkayasl in 1996. The Chalcolithic settlement at Giivercinka- yasl is located on top of a basalt ridge overlooking the right border of the Melendiz Suyu and Karasu confluence. Since the construction of the Mama- sun Dam, the lower parts of the settlement are reg- ularly submerged in springtime by the high waters of the Mamasun Dam. The settlement falls into two parts, a shallow mound on top of the rock that forms an acropolis, and a flat part extending like a fan toward the north and east of the acropolis. At first, excavations fo- cused on the lower terraces to the north and the east and later expanded toward the central settle- ment on the acropolis. The architecture of the northern and southern terraces consists of radially arranged agglutinative subrectangular rooms made from dry stone walls set directly on bedrock. Circular holes inside the rooms are interpreted as postholes. Floors and walls are plastered with mud.

The arrangement of rooms into long rows with an outer wall constructed from extremely large stones evokes the impression of a closed, for- tified settlement only accessible through two nar- row passageways opening into the center of the set- tlement. The doorways to these corridors could be blocked with stones. In this outer part, no doorways giving access to the interior of the houses could be observed. In the 1999 season, another row of hous- es was exposed in the central settlement running along a road paved with gravel. Here, doorways in the houses opened directly onto the road. In a lat- er phase, these doorways were again blocked with stones. One room held a remarkable amount of slag next to a large domed oven. The bulk of the pottery collected from Gfiver- cinkayasi is a monochrome handmade, well-bur- nished fabric of black, brown, or grey-beige color. Decoration includes incised herringbone patterns and incised fields filled with densely arranged im- pressed dots. Relief decoration is rare. Gulcur com- pares this material to the early Chalcolithic layers of nearby K6sk Hoyuk, to Alishar, and to the materi- al from Gelveri-Gfizelyurt. A second group of pot- tery is a light-colored coarse fabric with a brushed or flint-scraped surface that is mainly used for con- ical bowls and that can be connected to the eastern Anatolian "coba bowl" tradition. Rare specimens of painted pottery hint at Ubaid influences. Two bichrome painted vessels were reported in 1999. A stamp seal might also be another indication of con- nections with the southeast.55 Kosk Hoyiik. Aliye Oztan continued work at K6ok Hoyuk with an excavation season in 1996 and with restoration work in 1997. The early Chalcolithic kiln and copper working area exposed in layer 1, in the northeastern area, was further investigated and proved to have a sequence of six pebble floors. Next to it, ajar burial was dug into remains of the Neolithic period level 3. Radiocarbon dates now available for layer 1 (the early Chalcolithic period) fall in the first quarter of the fifth millennium B.C. In area 2, a large burnt building with beautifully preserved walls was completely uncovered.

Excavations at (3adir H6oyuk were resumed in 1998 by members of the Alishar Re- gional Project because of the impending flooding of the area by the Gelingfillfi Dam. A limited deep sounding on the southern slope allowed three Chalcolithic strata to be distinguished. The lower stratum, stratum III, revealed traces of two walls and a plaster floor. Stratum II had no architectural re- mains in the limited area exposed, but a previously excavated stone wall and the Chalcolithic enclo- sure wall are tentatively linked to this stratum. Stra- tum I had plaster basins and two child burials in jars. Domestic architecture and further burials from stratum I were exposed on a larger scale in two squares on the southern slope, under a thick accu- mulation of rock debris derived from the construc- tion of a late Classical terrace wall. The entire se- quence is characterized by black burnished pottery. Incised and dot-impressed ware was found in up- per stratum I and is compared by R. Gorny to Al- ishar levels 17-12.56 Bogazkoy. Chalcolithic ovens from recent exca- vations at Buyiikkaya are mentioned below. Western and Coastal Anatolia including Thrace Kemalpa!a-Ulucak Hoyiik. Here, the excavations carried out by Izmir Archaeological Museum, un- der the direction of A. (ilingiroglu, continued on top of the mound in trenches 0 11, N 11, and N 12 where late Neolithic/early Chalcolithic remains were found below the Bronze Age levels (about which, see below). A. Qilingiroglu reports: A total of 10 houses were documented. This build- ing level was apparently destroyed in a conflagra- tion; therefore, both in situ finds and architectural evidence are available for this period. The houses were made using two different techniques. Most of the walls were of mudbrick, although another small- er group made use of pise. Two buildings of late Neolithic/early Chalcolith- ic date were uncovered in trench N 11. One of these had a 50 cm wide door in its north wall and two platforms inside. A second building located to the north of the first was found immediately below the topsoil and was therefore in a bad state of preserva- tion. This house appeared to be a domestic unit with installations associated with everyday activities. A 70 x 120 cm oval platform made from fired clay was located inside the house. Next to this, a flat basalt stone used as a grinding stone was set with plaster into a boat-shaped compartment. Several pestle stones were found on top of the grinding stone and in a corner next to it. Two complete buildings of late Neolithic/early Chalcolithic date were unearthed in trench N 12. Inside one of these houses were two platforms, one along the south wall and one along the west wall. Pottery vessels and flint tools were found in situ on the west platform. Loom weights were lying next to the platform. In front of the south platform, a mor- tar and a pestle stone were found. A second flat stone, obviously used for the same work, was found further east, and round clay balls of unknown func- tion were also found. An oven with slag inside and around it was located south of the house. Work- shop areas and domestic structures were apparent- ly located side by side in this area, and an interest- ing detail of the architecture is the use of wood and wooden branches as building materials. Small finds and pottery from the buildings and workshops confirm their date as being in the late Neolithic to early Chalcolithic period. The pottery was made from brown, reddish-brown, and cream colored clay with fine sand, small stones, and or- ganic temper, and had a light brown, reddish- brown, or brown slip. The vessels are usually well fired. Only a few pieces have any decoration, and two distinct decorative techniques can be distin- guished. Either the vessels are painted, or they bear impressions of fingernails and notches. Painted decoration was applied with brown or reddish-brown color onto a cream-colored slipped surface. One anthropomorphic vessel with reddish- brown paint on cream slip was reported from trench O 11. When compared to Hacilar I pottery, the paint- ed decoration here uses simpler and less sophisti- cated patterns. The shapes include bowls with S- profiles, globular jars and deep bowls, bowls and plates with rounded rims, simple jars and high- necked jars, and jars with oval bases. Vertically pierced lugs and loop handles are abundant. Many vessels have oval bases, one of the characteristics of the late Neolithic pottery. A second group of decorated pottery was found on the house floors; this group has surfaces rough- ened by either fingernail impressions or notches. 56 For a preliminary report, see Anatolica 25 (1999) 149-83. 2001] 485</page><page sequence="24">ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING Compared to the Chalcolithic pottery found during previous seasons, the impressions on the Neolithic pottery are coarser and less well organized. Among the lithic finds, blades and borers made from flint are abundant, while only a few obsidian tools are recorded. Everyday objects such as mor- tars and pestles, polished work stones, and axes are found inside the buildings. Terra-cotta loom weights and bone awls, which were probably used for leatherworking, complete the picture. Bademagacl Hoyuk. Excavations at Bademagaci H6yuk, conducted by R. Duru, continued in the northeastern area where seven early Neolithic building layers were exposed over the last four sea- sons. While the lowermost three layers (EN 7-5) consist of only a sequence of plaster floors, the up- per four layers (EN 4-1) revealed significant archi- tectural remains. Major attention was paid to layer EN 3, where five buildings have been uncovered. Houses were freestanding rectangular single- roomed structures with rounded corners, built from mudbrick with freestanding posts as roof support. A door in the center of one long wall gave access to the interior, and a hearth was attached to the wall opposite the entrance. One building revealed trac- es of red paint. One small rectangular building with six compartments seems to be a freestanding stor- age structure. Monochrome burnished, hole mouth jars with vertical spool handles and vessels with hor- izontally cut rims were the most characteristic pot- tery forms. Pintaderas and pressure flaked obsid- ian points occur. Based on these finds, Duru pro- poses a comparison with Catalh6yuk levels VII/VI for Bademagacl Hoyik EN 4-3.57 Bakla Tepe. In anticipation of flooding due to be caused by the Tahtali Dam, Bakla Tepe in the Cuma Plain south of Izmir was subject to a joint rescue project from 1996 to 1998 by Ankara Univer- sity and Izmir Museum under the direction of H. Erkanal. Below a Bronze Age settlement (see be- low), remains of an exceptionally large Chalcolith- ic settlement were brought to light. Clustered behind a terrace wall, late Chalcolith- ic apsidal buildings with a grill-like internal struc- ture were excavated. These grills apparently served 57Annual reports appeared in KST18 (1997) 43-8; KST19 (1998) 113-21; KST20 (1999) 115-29; KST21 (2000) 109- 16.

Infant burials in jars were placed under the housefloors. Adults were buried in an extra- mural cemetery east of the settlement. The oldest layer reached dates to the early Chalcolithic and consists of round silos and platforms with cobbled floors. Inside a building with a curved wall, cylin- drical stone objects, tools, and metal slag were found. According to Erkanal, the Chalcolithic occupation at Baklatepe can be divided into four phases, which mirror the development seen at Kumtepe and which show ample evidence for Aegean relations.58 Latmos Survey. Survey of this important moun- tain region continued under the direction of An- neliese Peschlow-Bindokat.59 Be,ik-Sivritepe (Troia). During the 1998-1999 season, the Troia team investigated the so-called Achilles' Tomb at Besik-Sivritepe. M. Korfmann of Tubingen University reports: The mound was built up uniformly in layers of stone, clay, and rubble from the Neolithic settle- ment. The old Neolithic surface from the fifth mil- lennium, as it was before the mound was built up, was also investigated. The remains of a settlement with sherds, traces of burning, etc., may have been the reason why a monument was erected on this spot.60 Ilipinar. At Ilipinar, J. Roodenberg completed work on the northern and central parts of the mound, where a long stratigraphic sequence for the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods has been established. During the latter years of the project, attention shifted toward the southwestern part of the site, where architectural remains of the previ- ously only poorly documented period V levels could be uncovered and the stratigraphic link between periods VI and V firmly established. A major change in the chronological terminology of the site is that the upper part of phase VI has been renamed VA, and phase V is now called VB. In the western part of the mound, a phase VI building complex consisting of three rectangular on metal and slag analysis. 59Annual survey reports are published in AramST15 (1998) 373-84; Ara~ST17 (1999) 279-86; for a summary, see Arkeoloji ve Sanat 20/84 13-22.

The remains of a collapsed gable roof had sealed the contents of a two-story house and had preserved pottery, clay bins, and mud-lined baskets on the wooden plank floor. Apparently, the ground floor had been used as a storage area, whereas the upper floor was used for processing food. Four successive phase V buildings, each of rectangular outline with internal compart- ments, were uncovered in the western area. With phase VB (6000-5400 B.C. cal.), heavier walls, a new type of fireplace, and black burnished pottery types were introduced. An open-air food processing area from phase VB, with four horseshoe-shaped burnt ovens, pise bins, mud-lined wicker baskets, and ped- estals for grinding stones, was uncovered over an 80 m2 area.61 Mente!e Hoyiik. The shallow prehistoric mound Mentese Hoyuk, on the fringes of the Yenisehir plain, was investigated in three short seasons (1995- 1997) by J. Roodenberg and the Ilipinar team in cooperation with the Iznlk Museum. In addition to severe destruction caused by a road-cutting and continuous plowing, the site also proved to be heavi- ly disturbed by field voles; therefore, significant architectectural remains could only be recovered below the rodents' activity zone. Below a late Ro- man occupation, from which came pottery frag- ments in the upper part of stratum 1 and a burial, three prehistoric strata could be distinguished in main trench SSK 15, close to the center of the mound. Stratum 1 consisted of a thick deposit of open-air occupation levels in the center of the pre- historic village marked by concentrations of arti- facts and pottery. Several ditches had been dug for drainage purposes. The burials of three children and five adults had been dug from stratum 1, with the skeletons lying in flexed position on their right side. In one burial, traces of decayed wood were observed under the skull. Small vessels were placed in two of the burials. Grey and beige burnished pottery in carinated bowl forms recalls Illplnar VA examples. Stratum 2 was only ca. 30 cm deep and consisted of ash lenses that probably relate to a pe- riod when the mound was not in use as a settle- ment. Stratum 3 is the only layer with architectural remains. The western part of one house with mud slab walls interlaced with wooden stacks was exca- vated in the main trench SSK 15.

The southern boundaries of two further buildings with mud slab walls measuring 5.5 m and 6.5 m in length were uncovered in the western extension trench. A paved courtyard adjacent to the eastern building held several mud-lined baskets and square basins. According to cores taken in the center of the mound, another 3 m of deposits await excava- tion below stratum 3.62 Klrklareli-A!agl Pmar. The joint Turkish-German Eastern Thrace Project codirected by Mehmet Ozdogan and Hermann Parzinger continued with excavations at the Neolithic-Chalcolithic site Aaiag Pmnar. Soundings northeast of the central area have helped greatly in understanding the topography of the site. At the bottom of these soundings, build- ing levels predating AP 5 were uncovered. Appar- ently the original early Neolithic settlement was located northeast of the central excavation area, and only later did the settlement expand toward the southwest. Excavations in the central area, where only the later layers AP 2-5 exist, were completed, and several new large excavation trenches were opened in the northeast. The new trenches in the northeastern area have so far revealed extraordinarily well-preserved re- mains of burnt postwall houses of AP 2-6 date. Ex- cavations have not yet extended into the oldest lay- ers. One of the most striking features of the site is a malachite bead workshop in an AP 3 house uncov- ered in 1999. In this house, malachite pieces at every stage of the process from raw material to fin- ished bead were found next to an oven, as well as a hoard of broken beads and a collier on which the same type of beads was used. The hoard and the collier were probably deposited together in order to have the collier repaired. Among the tools used in this workshop were bone handles and flint bor- ers. Apparently the malachite was used only as a decorative stone, not as a possible metal ore. The lowest level reached so far is in the north- eastern area and dates to the end of the early Neolithic (AP 6 = Karanovo II). Here, a large burnt rectangular building with four rooms was uncov- ered. Parts of the collapsed walls and well-preserved interior features could be seen. Its extraordinary state of preservation makes it one of the best pre- served early Neolithic buildings in southeast Eu- 62 For a preliminary report on the excavation, see Anatolica 25 (1999) 21-36; see 37-51 on the skeletons.

Helwing) reports: Work in the step trench on the eastern slope continued, with emphasis on the large-scale ex- posure of Bronze Age remains in the main step trench and a northern extension trench. An im- portant result of this exposure was to prove a ma- jor gap in occupation on the eastern slope between EB IV and MB II. The MB II buildings form a ter- raced construction, which leans against the west- ern slope of an older EB tell with floor elevations of a single house unit sometimes varying by more than one meter.

In the northern extension trench, two courtyards, partly paved with un- trimmed basalt stones, and a kitchen floor yielded pottery characteristic of Alalakh IX-VII such as "black ware" and broad rim kettles. The larger of the courtyards was apparently used as an area for the processing of agricultural products: a large fireplace, a flat stone with a round depression, and a limestone tub were found (see fig. 10). In the step trench itself, the rooms were badly affected by slope erosion. West of the street, two rooms not yet stratigraphically connected to the main build- ing so far have been exposed. One was a burnt room, only partially within the step trench, that held eight large pithoi and a small jar of Alalakh VII type (see fig. 11). Another small rectangular room was used to dispose of burials: thrown onto a heap within the room, the largely disarticulated remains of 14 adults were found. Further burials of children in jars and some simple inhumations of adults were located below the floors. Among the most remarkable finds from the MB II layers is a limestone stele fragment found on the street and depicting a warrior god. Immediately beneath the MB II building, further EB III-IV tombs have been exposed: one chamber inger and M.

Kepinski-Lecomte in collabo- ration with the Gaziantep Museum have added an- other place to the map of third-millennium B.C. urban centers in southeastern Turkey and reveal evidence of earlier occupation on the high mound. A stratigraphic sounding on the high mound and several larger areas exposed in the lower town now allow us to sketch the occupation history of the site. The step trench on the slope of the citadel ("chantier E") revealed a stratigraphic sequence reaching down into late Chalcolithic layers. These consist of a massive mudbrick wall interpreted as an enclosure wall. Reserved slip pottery and chaff- tempered ware of Amuq F tradition place this lay- er at the end of the fourth millennium B.C. The wall was covered with a fill of mudbrick debris, above which two fragmentary rooms with mudbrick walls were documented. Material associated with these rooms contains reserved slip ware and band rim bowls and indicates an EB I date. The next phase consisted of a massive stepped mudbrick terrace of the EB II period. This terrace or plat- form represents the first massive construction measures undertaken during the later EB II and immediately predates the massive expansion of the town. This expansion was documented in several trenches in the northern and southeastern sec- tors of the lower town. Houses erected on virgin soil were documented both in the northern sec- tor ("chantier D") and the southeastern sector ("chantier J"). Metallic ware and other pottery types from a floor in the northern sector and from a tomb in the southeastern sector indicate a date toward the end of EB II for the first settlement of the lower town. A second occupation phase in the southeastern trench was exposed on a larger scale with four buildings grouped next to a street. A bronze tool hoard was found in one of the rooms. Syrian bottles and a depas fragment place this assemblage towards the end of the EB, con- firmed by radiocarbon dates. The next occupa- tion phase exposed in chantierJ belongs to a large multiroom building of the MB period. Numer- ous burials of the same age or slightly later were recorded in this area. The oldest occupation excavated so far dates to the late fourth millennium B.C. This settlement was restricted to the main mound and was appar- ently encircled by a massive mudbrick wall. It was followed by badly preserved EB I remains that were again sealed by the first massive construction of the EB II, the high terrace. Late in the EB II peri- od, a sudden extension of the settlement into sev- eral sectors of the lower town can be seen.

Rescue excavations had to be taken up by the Gaziantep Museum when grav- el quarrying for the construction of the Birecik Dam in 1996 hit upon a large Early Bronze Age cemetery. In four seasons between 1996 and 1999, 261 tombs were documented. They consist mainly of stone cist tombs constructed of slabs of the local limestone. Skeletons were almost never preserved because of the acidic conditions in the graves. Be- tween the graves, fireplaces and the remains of flimsy structures were observed. The grave goods consist of an enormous amount of pottery vessels in forms such as fruitstands, band rim bowls, and four-legged jars that are all well known from other EB I cemeteries in the area. Among the extraordi- nary metal finds, a cylinder seal surmounted by a caprid and a variety of pins with figural heads are noteworthy.66 Kinet Hoyiik.

On the mound's east terrace, the burnt MBII (Kinet V) building discovered in 1995 was extend- ed to a 200 m2 area. The exposed sector consists of two parallel, but noncommunicating, service wings belonging to a large-scale structure. The building underwent two phases, original construction and a careless repair after the original version was dam- aged by fire. Investigations of the later phase, de- scribed here, were completed by the 1999 season. In the east wing, connected storerooms were filled with large jars, cooking equipment, and tableware. Jars in the five northern rooms contained cereals and oil, the southern rooms' many containers- preserved, however, for the building's original phase only-were reserved for liquids and perish- able goods. The west wing, in contrast, was occu- pied by a large open court, flanked by two or three smaller units, probably also open-air. It was devoted to industrial activities, indicated by pise ovens (some resembling furnaces), a well, a bench with grinding equipment, and a stone mold for casting metal tools. A nude terra-cotta female figurine of MB Syrian type was found beside a hearth and oth- er heating installations in the southern court.

Calibrated radiocarbon dates for the two building phases span the late 18th to mid 15th centuries B.C., supporting the later ce- ramic evidence. The building was destroyed by earthquake and buried in water-land gravel and marine shell deposits. The east terrace was not oc- cupied until the Hellenistic and Medieval periods. Three LB II architectural levels were exposed in a 130 m2 operation on the mound's west slope, where excavations for this period had begun in 1994. They illustrate Kinet's integration into the Hittite empire of the 14th-13th centuries B.C. The earliest level excavated in 1999 and designated period 15 (Kinet IV.2) is represented by the stone foundations of an impressive building (fig. 13). Three separate stages from original construction until abandonment involved annexing a now erod- ed structure to the west, reworking room partitions, and raising the foundations to a final height of 1.25 m. Finds recovered from stratified fills includ- ed an exceptional number of metal pins and wire, a copper bun ingot, and crucible fragments con- taining cuprous residue. Pottery conformed to the central Anatolian tradition of the early empire (14th century B.C.) highly burnished tan- or red- brown pitchers and bowls, and coarser plates and platters with occasional potmarks. Storage jars, however, were Mediterranean "Caanite" type. Af- ter this building went out of use, its brick super- structure was razed and sealed by two levels of do- mestic housing, dating to the 13th century B.C. (periods 14 and 13/Kinet IV:1). The plans of these two single house units, which were doubled dur- ing the 1997 and 1998 seasons, involved courtyards and rooms for cooking and storage. Both were destroyed in violent fires: spearheads and other weapons in the western rooms of period 14 indi- cate an outright attack. In situ pottery from both periods maintained Hittite fabrics and shapes, supplemented by collared and collarless Caanite jars, and occasional Cypriot imports (White Slip II, Base Ring II). From the period 14 house, an elephant ivory cylinder seal was carved with deco- rative panels using LB Levantine motifs and fram- ing a pseudo-inscription (fig. 14). The abrupt end of Kinet's LB occupation, marked in the west slope operation by the burning of the period 13 house, was followed by radical changes in the next, early Iron Age phase (period 12/kinet 2001] 491</page><page sequence="30">ALAN M.

Other 1997-1999 operations recovered kilns of the eighth and sixth centuries B.C. in the residen- tial district on the mound's east slope, portions of a massive fortification wall and garrison built ca. 400 B.C. during the Persian period (fig. 15), and an extended view of the Medieval citadel and its planned lower town (12th-early 14th centuries A.D.). In addition, a geomorphological team car- ried out surveys to study Kinet's diachronic envi- ronmental context, with particular attention to hy- drological patterns and soundings in the area north of the mound to determine the coastline's ancient configuration. Together with a geophysical (mag- netometer) survey in the same area during the 2000 campaign, the soundings reflect the settlement sequence known from the mound proper. The dis- covery of early LB deposits 100 m northwest of the mound and close to the modern surface, without later overlay, would provide a first index to recon- structing the history of its harbors.67 67Annual excavation reports can be found in KST20 (1999) 259-81; KST21 (2000) 193-208. Topical reports have appeared on Achaemenid Persian and Hellenistic periods of the site, by $araga Hoyiik. Fikri Kulakoglu, Ankara Universi- ty, and Kemal Sertok, Gaziantep Museum, report: The site of $araga H6yiik, which lies on the west bank of the Euphrates, 5 km north of Karkamish, was investigated in 1998 and excavated in 1999 as part of the Illsu and Karkamish Dam project, and was one of the first victims of the water. The mound, which measured 200 m north-south and 150 m east-west, was chosen on the basis of an earlier sur- vey by Prof. Algaze. The mound must originally have been round in form, but was cut on the west side for cultivation and was eroded on the east side by the Euphrates. In 1999, excavations were carried out in the south and north sectors and uncovered Late Uruk; Early, Middle, and Late Bronze Age; and Iron Age and Medieval material, with a particular con- centration on the second-millennium B.C. levels. The Late Uruk levels could not be explored be- cause of the high water table, although some bev- elled rim bowls were found. The finds were not sufficient to determine the place of this site in the Uruk system, but it was probably within the so-called colonization chain, in consideration of Sadi Tepe, 5 km to the south. Early Bronze Age material was found only in trench K, under the monumental Middle Bronze Age building level. The first (lat- est) Early Bronze Age building phase had a two- roomed structure. The second building phase had a building with a room with a circular hearth in it. A coarseware kitchen pot and a fine paste storage ves- sel with a flat base were found in situ. In the earliest level of the Early Bronze Age, a layer of stamped earth that covered the whole trench and two paral- lel walls were found. The pithos-burial of an infant was excavated in the northern part of the trench. Wheelmade mass production wares such as globu- lar vases, the so-called Hama goblets, and tripod jars were the characteristic pottery of the Early Bronze Age layer in trench K. Terra-cotta bull figu- rines, Canaanean blades, and other small artifacts were also found. In the first phase of the Middle Bronze Age, re- mains of a monumental building were found in both the north and south trenches. It measured 45 m north-south, and several storage jars for provisions suggest that the excavated area was the building's depots. The architecture of the building was re- newed several times, with old walls being thickened by new support walls, without any change in the C.

The same was true of the defensive wall, which survived up to a height of 1.2 m in places. In trench A in the south sector, there was a cist grave in which multiple burials were ob- served. The later phase of the Middle Bronze Age was represented by several pot and inhumation graves, above the monumental building of the first phase, but the architectural plan could be well traced. Typical Middle Bronze Age pottery includes large storage jars with grooved rims and incised combed pattern decoration, similar to examples from Haradum, Hadidi, Kara Kuzak, Hamman et- Turkman, and other Middle Euphrates sites. A pil- grim flask found in the cist grave has parallels at Karkamish, Mari Harardum, Kurban Hyuiik, and Kfiltepe. Syrian bottles also show close connections with the north Syrian sites and neighboring settle- ments. The importance of $araga Hoyuk in this period is not in the first degree, because of the neighboring site of Karkamish, but the existence of this palatial building shows that it was another important settlement at this time. In the Late Bronze Age, there was a level of sim- ple planned houses. A Mitannian seal, found in one of these buildings, and sherds of Late Habur wares with painted rows of bird motifs help to date this level. Traces of Iron Age cultural phases, in- cluding a kiln with parallels in Nuzi and Tel Jigan, were found under the surface soil. To the west of the kiln was an inhumation grave with rich gifts including a bronze kohl, a bronze mirror, silver and agate necklace beads, a copper ring, and earrings. Seven amphorae were lined up vertically on the west side of the deceased. Terra-cotta horse and female figurines date this to the late Iron Age, that is, the fifth to fourth centuries B.C. Konya-Karaman Survey. Hasan Bahar of Selcuk Universitesi, Konya, reports on progress in this on- going survey project, which began in 1994 and will continue next year: In 1999, our area survey began 35 km north of Konya at Dogu Gfivenc Hoyuk and worked east, vis- iting sites such as Asagi Pinarb5i, T6mek, and T6mek-Gevre. In this area, material dating from the Chalcolithic to the Classical period was found. At T6mek there were rich surface finds, including 10 round loom weights made of grey clay; it is there- fore a potential site for future research. Eighty km between Konya and Karaplnar, at Akkuyu and Sirnik H6yfik, Early Bronze Age and Hittite Imperial peri- od pottery was found. On the other side, to the west of Konya, research was carried out in the Derbent and H6yfik districts and at Cavus Kale and H6yufk, finds of the second millennium B.C. and early first millennium B.C. were made. Cavu? Kale is in the district of Hoyuk in the town of Cavus 2001] 493</page><page sequence="32">ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING East of Konya, in the Karadag and Klzlldag region, the tell sites of Kasoba, Kissecik, Islihisar I and II, Sileyman Haci, and Mezeltepe I were visited. Islihisar II was especially important for the second millenni- um B.C. and early Iron Age periods. This is a very historic area and these new finds provide additional information about the Kizildag-Hartapus monument. This is an inscription, high on the rock face, with the seated figure of the late Hittite king Hartapus. A step- altar, stone ramparts, and a single rock-cut tomb were also found here. At Siileyman Haci a decorated stone lintel was found. Ziyaret Tepe. In 1997 a new intensive survey project was begun at this Late Bronze Age to Iron Age (Mid- dle and Neo-Assyrian) urban center by Timothy Mat- ney, who reports: Ziyaret Tepe is a large multiperiod mounded site located on the south bank of the Tigris River, east of Tepe and 20 km west of the confluence of the Tigris and Batman Rivers. With a commanding view, it is sit- uated atop a broad, low terrace overlooking the wide Tigris floodplain. The site consists of a high mound and a surrounding lower town. The high mound, to the north, rises 22 m above the terrain and is approx- imately 3 ha in extent. A depression on the north edge of the high mound marks the probable location of an important gate leading onto the citadel. The lower town spreads over 32 ha to the west, south, and east of the high mound, and this area is generally flat, although a slight rise at the southern edge marks the line of the ancient city wall. The objectives of the Ziy- aret Tepe project are to document the Upper Tigris region that will be flooded by the Ilisu Dam, to study town planning at the site in the Assyrian phase, and to reconstruct the ancient natural and human resourc- es and land-use patterns in order trace the environ- mental impact of Assyrian urbanization. Surface and subsurface exploration of the set- tlement in 1997 and 1998 generated a topograph- ic plan of the site, a series of pottery distribution maps, a settlement history, and preliminary subsur- face magnetic field gradient survey maps for por- tions of the high mound and lower town. In 1999, the initiation of cotton farming in the southeast corner of the site prompted us to concentrate work in that area, and an area of 5.12 ha of the lower town was mapped using magnetometers. The surface survey provided evidence for an oc- cupational history of the site from the late Neolith- 68 In order to positively identify some of these features, excavations are planned for 2000. A preliminary report on the 1997 survey has now appeared in Ara4ST 16:255-66. ic/early Chalcolithic period to the early Islamic period (ca. 5500 B.C. to A.D. 800). The largest con- centration of material was in the Late Bronze Age and Iron Age. In the Middle Bronze Age the site grew, and the entire high mound appears to have been occupied. In the second half of the second millennium B.C., with the expansion of the Mid- dle Assyrian empire into the Upper Tigris basin in the late Bronze Age, there was considerable change. For the first time, large portions of the lower town were occupied, creating a small urban center of approximately 32 ha. There are very few early Iron Age sherds but in the late Iron Age (Late or Neo- Assyrian) period there was rapid reurbanization. Late Assyrian pottery was found across the high mound and all of the lower town area. Presumably, this occupation stopped in the late seventh centu- ry B.C. with the collapse of the Late Assyrian em- pire. Ziyaret Tepe may be one of a series of garrison towns on the Tigris known to have existed from Assyrian historical sources, perhaps the regional capital of Tushan. The magnetometer survey has identified a num- ber of interesting anomalies including the proba- ble line of the city walls with some possible gates or towers. A large circular positive magnetic feature in the southern half of the site may be a kiln, and a series of linear features, at approximately 25 m in- tervals across the lower town, may prove to be terrac- es, defensive walls, or field boundaries.68 Hatay. A study of dolmens in the Hatay region has been carried out by Bakiye Yukmen. A consid- erable number of these interesting monuments have been located by this survey. Although they are presumed to be Bronze Age in date, their absolute date cannot be confirmed by survey methods alone.69 Horum Hoyuk. Despite extensive Medieval dis- turbance in trench B, high up on the mound, two modest Bronze Age buildings were identified, bor- dered to the south by what is probably a corridor. The walls appear to have had stone foundations that followed the orientation of the preceding struc- ture. This building tradition was used throughout the third millennium B.C. The pottery associated with these foundations includes Banded-Rim Ware bowls and cups of the Early Bronze Age I period, with parallels at Kurban H6yiik V, Tell Qara Quzak V, and Birecik cemetery. Here, detailed study of the pottery and stratigraphy has shown stylistic de- 69An article on this work appeared in Arkeoloji ve Sanat 96 (2000) 18-21. 494 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY velopment over time in the material and suggests that the Early Bronze Age I period (ca. 2200-1900 B.C.) was a long period of occupation at this site. In trenches F and J at the eastern base of the mound, where it was heavily eroded by the Euph- rates, the objective was to expose as large an area of architectural remains as possible. Here, there were numerous walls of the Middle Bronze Age (EB IV) period. From these an understanding of the archi- tectural practices of the Early Bronze IV period can be obtained, such as the use and frequent reuse of stone foundations. This period is dated by incised decorated pottery similar to that from Kurban H6yfik III and Tell Banat/Kabir. In all three trenches (B, F, andJ), typical third- millennium intramural infant burials in jars were found. There was also one adult burial in trench F, of Middle Bronze Age date (ca. 1600 B.C.) ac- companied by pottery comparable with that of Ladar Hoyuik 4 and 5.

Here Nejat Bilgen has been exca- vating a Middle Bronze Age extramural necropo- lis, which parallels to the early Hittite Royal Period, and has uncovered a large number of pithos buri- als. The graveyard is now under a plowed field, and the upper part of most of the burials has been dam- aged by the plow; in some cases few bones have survived. In several examples there are two skele- tons in a single burial in a contracted (fetal) posi- tion. In one case a cremation and an inhumation were buried together. In one very large (60 x 110 cm) pithos, sealed with a stone slab (85 x 65 cm), there were the skeletons of three infants and one young adult, who was perhaps 18 years of age. Grave goods included earrings (in some cases found in situ), shell beads, and pins. Hakkairl. Thirteen carved stone stele were found here on the north slope of Hakkari Castle. They varied in height from 90 cm to 3.1 m and usually had a single naked man as the central motif. These figures usually have a belt, dagger and litus, axe, spear, and tent. One example depicts two animals fighting. There is great difficulty in dating these stele. Parallels may exist in Iran, Scythia, and even Iberia, and although the iconography appears to be Late Bronze Age, no definite comparisons or dating can be made. Two different styles can be distin- guished-the earlier ones are in high relief and the later ones are incised. Parallels can be seen in similar stele across a wide area from northern Rus- sia to Portugal, with a variety of dates being suggest- ed for them. The Hakkarl examples were excavat- ed, but there are no graves associated with them and only a little monochrome pottery has been found. The excavator, Veli Sevin, dates them to about 1200 B.C. Twenty meters to the east, a chamber tomb was found and excavated. Inside this were the remains of 50 human skeletons, two bronze daggers that had been deliberately bent, and some silver earrings. A quantity of painted pottery was found including a rhyton of "Van Urmia" (Aras Painted) ware and two pots of Habur ware dating to the first half of the second millennium B.C.70 Zeytinli Bah:e Hoyuk. For the Early Bronze Age occupation, see above. The 15 m high steep conical elevation sitting on the northern end of Zeytinli Bahce H6yiik proved to be an artificial construction.

GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING buildings were constructed using mudbricks mea- suring 60 x 70 cm and were founded on step terrac- es with retaining walls made of mudbrick. The walls had stone foundations eight or nine courses high, with doorways, and occasionally plaster was found covering the mudbrick. In one building the west wall was a high stone wall, and the other walls were of mudbrick, so two construction techniques were in use in the same building. In situ finds included nine jars, six bowls, a ba- salt saddle quern, the head of a mace, and a burnt limestone model of a house. Typical Early Bronze Age 4 bell-shaped pottery was found as well as a Jemdet Nasr style cylinder seal. During excavation of the leveled mudbrick sur- face upon which the buildings partly rested, infant pithos burials were found as was a single shaft grave. The shaft grave was sealed with a flat stone, and when it was opened it was very richly furnished with a total of 46 small finds. Interred in the grave were two infants, side by side, and a third infant in a square larnax-type terra-cotta coffin that had a draining hole in it. This may originally have been a bath. The finds included four pins, five beads, two quadrafoil kantharoi, and a bird-shaped rattle. A survey was made and the source of the basalt used for building foundations at Gre-Virike was found nearby at Karadag. Recording was also car- ried out at the nearby site of Mezraa H6yuik, where recent activity has cut into the hill, exposing a clean profile through the tell. The Beylik (Medieval), Ro- man, Hellenistic, early Middle Bronze Age, and all phases of the Early Bronze Age were represented in this section. Hiiseyindede. In 1998 excavation of a large rectangular formal building at this site began. Work continued in 1999, and a total area of 500 m2 has now been opened up. The base and walls of the building are constructed using stone, with no evidence so far for the use of mudbrick or wooden columns. The north wall was 1 m thick, and large rectangular blocks were used for the base of walls, with smaller stones being used for the upper walls. This wall technique parallels Old Hittite architecture. In places, the bases of the walls sit directly on the bedrock. In 1998, thick plaster was found in the cult room, but in 1999, none was found. The building was partly floored with compact earth and partly with stone slabs. In 1999, a new area was opened to the north- west of the mound and here also stone floors were Fig. 16.

A bronze dagger that parallels Alaca H6yfik 3 a and b types was found, and pottery including kitch- en wares, pitchers, and pithoi was found. A large amphora with relief decoration of a type and sub- ject similar to that found at Inandlk was also found and restored. This important cult artifact, together with the cult room and storage rooms that have been found, have led the excavators, T. Yildirim, T. Sipa- hi, and I. Ediz, to interpret the site as a cult center for the weather god.71 Kiilliioba. Turan Efe has been working on this site to the southeast of Eskisehir. Six building lev- els have been identified, the earliest of which dates to the final late Chalcolithic period. There are two Early Bronze Age stratigraphic levels. At the start of the Early Bronze Age, on the north side of the tell, a zigzag mudbrick wall was built. This was probably a rampart wall and was plastered on the outside. Houses with simple red earthen floors were built up against the inside of this ram- part wall. The fortifications were made on an earth embankment similar to Semayfik-Karatas. The ar- chitecture of this period is mudbrick, with mega- ron buildings. Pottery of the Demircihoyiik D, E, and F, and Beycesultan barbotine types, dating to the end of the EB I period, was found. In the second Early Bronze Age level (EB II-III period), there was an upper and a lower town. The ruins of the lower town are situated on the east slope of the hill. A 21 m long megaron was found here. The area in front of this megaron was paved with stones and there was a storage area under the floor, which was divided in two by a wall. In the ante- chamber there was a hearth. A tankard-style pot 71 For a preliminary report, see KST21 (2000). [AJA 105 496</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY Fig. 17.

From the fourth phase of the site came some depas cups, some of which were large (ca. 50 cm high) and some of which had incised decoration (fig. 16). Red pol- ished pottery of the early Troy II type was also found. Two marble idols, snapped off at the neck, were found. These resembled Karata? types.72 Acemhoyiik. From 1997 to 1999, Aliye Oztan exca- vated the area between the Sarikaya palace and the Hatipler palace, following on from geophysical sur- vey carried out in previous years. In this area, a trench 50 x 50 m was opened and three levels were found. The first (upper) level was very heavily destroyed. In the second (middle) level, square and trapezoidal houses were found built on top of the heavily burnt third (lower) level. The third level dates to the Assyrian trade colony 1 and 2 periods and had a single large building, of which 14 rooms were excavated. The architecture of this building consisted of mudbrick walls, made us- ing two sizes of mudbricks, and wooden posts. Two types of plaster were used, first a fine clay and then a whitewash. This building had thick, high walls, and this may indicate that it was originally two stories high. In room 3 remains of a doorframe were found. In room 5 there were wooden remains in the upper lay- ers and in room 6 there was also evidence to suggest the existence of a second story. Room 7 was an L- shaped corridor in which a lidded vase and mug were found. In room 8 in the upper layer were further wood remains and a bulla, with a "Master of Animals," resem- bling one found in the Sarlkaya palace. In another room of the third level building a bench was found parallel to the wall. This building is contemporary with the adjacent palaces. A total of 48 artifacts were found, including and- irons, lidded vases, stands, mugs, and Alisar III pot- tery in secondary use. A unique find is a hematite duck weighing 2,534 grams. (anklrl/Paphlagonia. A five year program of multi- period survey commenced in 1997, directed by Rog- er Matthews, British Institute of Archaeology at Anka- ra, who reports: In this research the emphasis is on the nature of interactions between people and landscapes over very long time periods, the study of human ecody- namics. The Romano-Byzantine province of Paphlag- onia lies in northern Anatolia, spanning the transi- tion between the Anatolian plateau and the Pontic mountains of the Black Sea region. In archaeologi- cal terms the area is scarcely investigated. During the first three seasons of fieldwork the aim has been to build up a general chronological framework for settlement history before proceeding with more in- tensive work in 2000-2001. Major features of the settlement history so far discerned include a marked absence of early pre- historic occupation, and the location of sizeable Early Bronze Age sites adjacent to natural resourc- es such as obsidian, flint, and rock-salt. During the Late Bronze Age, the time of the Hittite em- pire, this region was an important border zone between the Hittites, with their capital close by to the southeast, and the troublesome Kashka peo- ple of the adjacent mountains. We have located numerous medium- to large-sized Late Bronze Age mounds, many of them with stone fortifications and access ramps, all strategically distributed across the landscape and clearly functioning as nodes of con- trol in a centuries-long military conflict between 72For reports, see KST20 (1999) and KST21 (2000). 2001] 497</page><page sequence="36">ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING the Hittites and their neighbors. One such site is at Dumanli, where Late Bronze Age fortifications were found (see fig. 17). In the Iron Age we find new types of sites, includ- ing burial tumuli, rock-cut tombs and hilltop forts. The Roman and early Byzantine settlement pattern shows a dispersal of settlement, ranging from ham- let to large town over the entire landscape of south- ern Paphlagonia, which in subsequent centuries up to the present, shows substantial fluctuations in set- tlement density and distribution. Ongoing studies include the extraction of lake sediment cores for environmental analysis, pottery studies, and work on the Ottoman tax records of the 16th century A.D.73 Sos Hoyuk-Erzurum. The excavators (A. Sagona, M. Erkman, C. Sagona, and I. McNiven) report: In 1997, an early Trans-Caucasian or Kura-Arax- es burial was found. The grave was a simple sub- ovoid pit, measuring 1.8 x 1.8 m. The skeleton was in a flexed position, oriented approximately east- west and accompanied by a black burnished bowl placed under the right hip and two rings made from shell. The human bones produced a calibrated date range of 2560-2525 B.C. and 2500-2195 B.C. This grave was partially cut through by later graves, exca- vated in 1996-1997, which were accompanied by grave goods of the Trialeti tradition. In one of these graves the bones were disarticulated, except for the lower arms, which were crossed and in their correct anatomical position, deliberately placed to the east of the body and giving the impression that they had been severed at the elbows. This burial was accom- panied by a black jar with a crude incised design of hanging triangles filled with white paste and a shell ring. The human bone was dated to 2575-2300 B.C.74 On the general stratigraphy and early occu- pation of the mound, see above. Sivas. Survey of goldworking installations was car- ried out by Ergun Kaptan at Sivas Kangal Cetinkaya. Remnants of mining activity were found on the north slopes of Bakirtepe, including rubble and large stone mortars. The mortars were made from large stones with a depression on one or occasionally both sides, in which the ore was broken and crushed before being washed and processed. Inside some of the mortars, traces of gold were found. In the surround- ing area were hundreds of pestle-stones, with which the ore had been crushed. E.

Excavations on Tepe III by Onder Bilgi have been carried out since 1993 and have now un- covered 11 architectural levels at this hilltop prom- ontory site to the east of the delta of the Kizilrmak (ancient Halys) River. These levels date to the Early and Middle Bronze Ages, Late Iron Age, and Helle- nistic period, although many of them have been damaged by modern agricultural activity at the site. The most important finds in recent seasons were recovered from the Bronze Age levels. The site does not appear to have been planned in any way, with an irregular arrangement of single rectangular build- ings. The Early Bonze Age pottery is handmade, and an interesting find from 1997 was a terra-cotta mod- el of a snake, found in level six. An Early Bronze Age cemetery had previously been found on Tepe I at Ikiztepe, and the excava- tions at Tepe III in 1999 appear to have found an industrial quarter of some description (presumably for working or processing metals). Several hard- backed clay ovens of oval or subrectangular shape have been found here, some of which had a working area in front of them. One of the ovens had a wood- en structure built around it and appears to have been repaired on three occasions, and another may have been equipped with bellows. Finds from levels two, three, and four included terra-cotta figurines, a whet- stone, a bronze pin, and a spoon, arrowhead, and cutter all crafted from bone. An infant burial was also found this year. A survey of the surrounding region was made to try to locate sources of ores in the vicinity. On the western side of the Emir (ayl valley, a source of ar- senic was located, and analysis has confirmed that arsenic was also being used at Ikiztepe. Evidence of arsenic copperworking from Kozlu dates to 2800 B.C. There was also Hellenistic period slag at the site.

For 50 years, excavations at Kuilte- pe-Kanis have provided an unrivaled amount of in- formation that illuminates not only the history of Ana- tolia and Assyria but also the roots of Hittite art. Re- cent excavations, under the direction of Tahsin Ozgfic, have concentrated in the karum of the lower town, where a street flanked by rectilinear multi- roomed houses has been uncovered, dating the pe- riod of the Assyrian trade colony (Kiltepe-Kanis II and Ib). Typical pottery includes high spouted pitch- ers, kantharoi with quadrafoil mouths, animal rhyta, and vessels stamped with the signe royal. One jug has a horse's head protome at the point where the handle adjoins the lip of the vessel, a type that is known in later Hittite times but is seen here in an earlier con- text. A terra-cotta plaque with a scene of a family of gods also prefigures Hittite art in its depiction of the clothes and heads of the figures. Two forms of "cark" (terra-cotta models of shoes with pointed, upturned toes) can be identified. The earlier form had careful painted decoration, and the second had relief decoration. More stamp seals of local Anato- lian type and cylinder seals of Assyrian type have also been found.76 Kaman-Kalehoyiik. Excavations here are now in their 14th year and, under the direction of Sachihi- ro Omura, they are currently concentrated on the large northern trench, with the objective of further clarifying the stratigraphy of this large, 280 m diam- eter, 16 m high mound, set in rich agricultural land. Five levels have now been identified, dating from the Early Bronze Age to the Ottoman period. The most important results of the last few years are as follows. All the pottery of the lowest level (Kaman V), which is handmade, is finely-produced and dates to the final phase of the Early Bronze Age. This period has modest houses with many pits. The next level (Ka- man IV) also has handmade pottery and dates to the Middle Bronze Age with parallels to the Alisar three or Kiltepe-Kanis third and fourth periods. 7A newbookby T. Ozgiuc has also appeared (1999). Anoth- er important publication from this site is Michel and Garelli 1997.

One bulla has a bird motif that resembles one from Karum-Kanis level Ib. This destruction is dated by the excavator to the 18th century, at a date some- where before 1745 B.C. Excavation continued in the 15 m diam. stone-lined pit of the Old Hittite (Ka- man IIIb) period, the function of which is still not clear. The pit is fully 4.5 m deep, and after digging down 4 m, a layer of ash was encountered in which were many bullae. These may not necessarily have been in situ, and S. Omura suggests that the site may have been unoccupied at this time. Other than the pit, a wide (1.5 m) 10 m long stretch of wall was un- covered that had been built on the Kaman IIIc de- struction level. From the Hittite empire period (Ka- man IIIa), finds included a biface stone stamp seal with a tree-of-life flanked by goats motif on one side and a hieroglyphic inscription on the reverse. Levels IIc and IId are distinguished by their ar- chitecture and date to the second half of the eighth and start of the seventh centuries B.C. The houses of period IIc are single-roomed pit dwellings and those of IId are the same but with the addition of postholes. A cellar of level IIb, of the early seventh century B.C., contained a faience scarab, a Phry- gian fibula, and a Scythian arrowhead. The archi- tecture of level IIa, which dates from the second half of the seventh century to the fourth century B.C., is typically built on a single line of large stone blocks, and the buildings have small rooms. In one room the floor appears to have been relaid two or three times, and here a faience cylinder seal of the late eighth/early seventh century B.C. and a faience stamp seal in the shape of a lion were found. Also found in this level were a scarab, a bronze plaque, an iron blade, and a very attractive, although sadly fragmentary, animal's head carved in transparent rock crystal. S. Omura's general survey in Anatolia, begun in 1986, has continued to identify and document a large number of sites and objects from surface col- lection, dating from the Neolithic period onward, in a broad region around Kaman-Kaleh6yfik.77 kasa 1998).

Jurgen Seeher, German Archaeologi- cal Institute in Istanbul, reports on recent excava- tions on Biuyukkaya, which constitutes the north- eastern part of the site of Hattusa: The earliest settlement of Biyuikkaya, and of the area as a whole, dates from the sixth millen- nium B.C. in the Chalcolithic period. After a long pause in occupation, there were two phases of settlement in the late Early Bronze Age, which disturbed the earlier Chalcolithic layer. Although there is much interesting early Bronze Age mate- rial, including ovens and stone casting molds, these levels were themselves in turn disturbed. Settlement remains of the Hittite Old Kingdom period were encountered on all three of the site's plateaux, but no clear picture of activity in the period is possible because of the later activity. The east wall was the earliest defensive wall, dat- ing to the turn of the 15th-14th centuries B.C. at the latest. This wall continued in a northerly di- rection, surrounding the northern and western part of the lower city and united with the so-called postern wall at the southwestern side of the old city. On the southern spur of the upper plateau on Bfuyukkaya is a large building complex of the Hittite Imperial period that presumably had some official function. In the developed Hittite Imperial period, the east wall was built over by a new wall that no longer continued in the direction of the northern town, but rather bent from the northeast spur towards the west, and Buyiikkaya became a citadel. On the lower and middle plateaux, large square-shaped pits, from 6 x 6 m to 12 x 18 m in size, were dug to serve as underground silos for the storage of cere- als under airtight conditions. Eleven silos have been identified but there were probably several more. The new excavations have not confirmed the pri- or assumption that Buyuikkaya was first fortified in the 13th century B.C.; in fact it has been shown to have been enclosed much earlier than the town area. Any connection between the contemporary activities on Buyiikkaya and the graveyards at Os- mankayasl and Baglarbaglkayasl and the rock sanc- tuary at Yazilikaya could not be made. Buyuikkaya was being heavily fortified in this period in order to keep stored cereals safe here. In the lower city, behind the postern wall, halfway between Kizlar Kaya and Bfiyiikkale, a building com- 78 Recent developments in the Iron Age at Bogazk6y are mentioned below, under "Iron Age: Central and Western Ana- tolia." Interim reports on the 1997 and 1998 seasons have now appeared, in German, in AA 1998, 215-41 and AA 1999, 317- 44, respectively. The latter report includes a new topographic map of the site. A new guidebook byJirgen Seeher, Hattusha: plex of the early Hittite empire period was reinvesti- gated. This structure had been tested in the 1960s, and in 1998 and 1999 it was identified as grain stor- age facility. The silo complex was built in the same period as the postern wall, or earlier. The complex is 118 m long and between 35 and 40 m wide, orient- ed northwest-southeast and with two rows of 16 cham- bers each. Each chamber is 6 m wide, 13-16 m long, and with a floor made of broken stones. The 1.5 m thick walls stand on sockels of broken stone and sur- vive up to 2 m in height. The silo chambers were stepped into the slope of the land, and the differ- ence in height between one end of the complex and the other is about 15 m. Clay packing used as insulation on the outer walls shows that, for the most part, the building lay underground. Twelve silo chambers were destroyed by fire, their mudbrick walls having been burnt, with impressions of wood- en planks and beams at 30-40 cm intervals preserved. The upper part of the mudbrick dividing walls col- lapsed into the chambers below. In one place the height of one of these walls could be reconstructed: it must originally have stood at least 3.8 m high on its uphill face and 4.5 m high on its downhill face. The chambers contained a massive quantity of carbonized grain. The grain was not totally inciner- ated because of the principle on which these stor- age silos worked: that is, they were airtight. Directly on top of the grain a thick layer of straw was laid as insulation, and on top of that was a 1 m thick layer of clayey earth. This worked to ensure that when the silo complex was burnt, the grain became car- bonized but was not totally destroyed. Botanical re- search by Reinder Neef has shown that barley was the most common grain, with one silo chamber con- taining einkorn. Also of interest were seeds from other crops and weeds found together with the grain in the silos. There are several hundred tons of carbonized grain here, which seems to be the largest find of its kind in the ancient Near East. The size of the silo complex, however, which is long- er than a football (soccer) pitch and more than half as wide, is even more unusual. This could have stored up to 7000-9000 m2 of grain, enough for the annual requirements of 20,000-30,000 people. This clearly shows that this was not just supplies for the city of Hattusa-for here was stored a part of the state's treasure and the power base of the Hittite Great King.78 A Day in the Hittite Capital (1999), is now available in English, German, and Turkish versions.

In 1997 and 1998 the work of Aykut Cinaroglu was concentrated on the cleaning of stat- uary, including the famous Sphinx Gate, to remove a red microfungus that had started to erode the stonework. The stone had to be laboriously cleaned by hand with water and a brush before a fungicide was applied. This work allowed some of the previ- ously excavated blocks to be reexamined and occa- sionally new in situ pottery was found. Geophysical prospection work was also carried out. In 1999, excavation was begun under the Phry- gian houses to the east of the Mabet Saray. Sections of two walls were uncovered-one made of mud- brick and one of stone. By means of careful excava- tion, the surface of the mudbrick wall was cleaned to reveal the imprint of reeds that had originally been against the wall, possibly to create a pocket of stationary air against the wall for insulation. Finds included early and late painted Phrygian pottery. The curved stone wall was made of close fitting po- lygonal blocks. The fill of the wall was packed with stones and earth, the exterior side is missing, and only the interior face survives. This may have been the wall of a temenos enclosure. The finds includ- ed seal impressions, a small stone idol, obsidian, a fragment of the foot of a rhyton, and second-millen- nium pottery including high spouted jars.79 Ortak6y-(:orum. Aygfil Suel has continued to excavate in the two Imperial Hittite buildings, A and B. Recent work on the west wing of building A has shown that it was 27 m long and constructed of fine masonry. There may have been some kind of ramp here, but it was damaged by later burials. The area around the building was cobbled. Approxi- mately 3,500 tablets and fragments of tablets have now been found in this one building. It is dated by dendrochronology to 1365 B.C. At building B, excavations of the huge depot con- tinued, with 40 pithoi having been found across several rooms. This area was also disturbed by later tombs. The archive of this building also now ap- pears to have been found, and a number of tablets, including oracle texts and letters similar to those from building A have been found, although they are heavily burnt.80 Ku?aki. Excavations at this important Hittite site, the ancient name of which was Sarissa and which has close parallels to Bogazk6y, continued under the direction of A. Mfiller-Karpe. Work was carried 79For a preliminary report, see KST21 (2000). '8Annual reports have been published in KST 19 (1998) 515-28; KST20 (1999) 433-44; KST21 (2000) 321 if.

A total of 83 rooms have been found, forming a single building com- plex around a central courtyard, which may have been a temple for the weather god. The building had two entrances, each 3 m wide, one of which had a guard's chamber. On the west slope, three building layers were iden- tified, the lowest of which dates to the Hittite Old Kingdom period. From the Hittite Imperial period, nine houses, the plans of which parallel Alisar, have been identified. Faunal analysis revealed a large percentage of sheep, goat, and hunted animals (in- cluding wild goat), but relatively few cattle. At the City Gate, excavations were carried out following a geophysical survey. Uprights for door- jambs with a door socket as part of the same block were found. These are known at Bogazk6y, as are drilled orthostats, some of which were filled with burnt wood. However, the gate was of a Syrian-Le- vantine type that is unknown from Bogazk6y. Geo- physical survey beyond the city wall suggests the existence of a viaduct leading up to the gate.8' Kilise Tepe. In his final seasons in 1996 and 1997, J. Nicholas Postgate, working in association with Silifke Museum, excavated Bronze Age and Iron Age layers on the northwest side of the mound. Although this was originally planned as a rescue excavation, changes in the level of the Kayraktepe Dam mean that this site will not now be destroyed. In a deep sounding, Early Bronze Age layers were found and were divided by the excavators into sev- en phases from the EB 2 (phases h, I,j, and k) to EB 3 (phases e, f, and g) periods. These layers were found above the conglomerate bedrock and repre- sent the earliest occupation of the site. From phase j came in situ EB 2 pottery, including handmade painted jugs with painted red "net" patterns, and a "champagne cup," found in the debris of a mud- brick room that had been destroyed by fire. Excava- tions of the EB 3 phases (e, f, g, and h) added great- ly to the understanding of ceramics and architec- ture, as well as numerous flints and spindlewhorls. In phase g was a building, the floor of one room of which had been repeatedly relaid with layers of fine yellow plaster. In phase e there were no architec- tural remains, and in this period the area appears to have been an open area used for large storage 81 For reports, see MDOG 129 (1997) 103-42; 130 (1998) 93-174; 131 (1999) 57-113.

GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING pits. Also from the Early Bronze Age layers came the skeleton of a child, the only burial to be found at the site, outside of the Byzantine church. The Middle and Late Bronze Age layers (levels IV and III) included pottery lids of type known from Tarsus and a large numbers of carbonized figs. Layer III, which on the basis of late Hittite pottery found in it, was presumed to date from the Late Bronze Age was dated by dendrochronology samples taken from some carbonized logs to 1381 B.C. Further samples have also been taken from building timbers in level IIc. Beneath the Iron Age levels were some sherds of Mycenaean LH IIIC bowls and cups from level IId, demonstrating links to the Mediterranean. This pottery also provides a link to the precise chronolo- gy of the Aegean, which is particularly important, given the dendrochronology results from the site. The most intriguing building on the site is the "Stele Building" from level II. It had solid founda- tions of four or five layers of stone and measured about 18 x 14 m. In phase IIc, this building was destroyed by fire. Finds from this building includ- ed a hoard of astragali from different species of animals. This building had a central hearth and probably an open courtyard. In the area around it carbonized grain and burnt olives were found in jars, sunken pits, and a semi-basement room. To the east of the "Stele Building" was another build- ing with two parallel rooms, reached from an L-shaped open space, paved with irregular slabs. Pottery from this building included pilgrim flasks and a trefoil- mouthed jug. This building had also been destroyed in a fierce fire, and both buildings appear to have been burnt, reoccupied, and then burnt again.82 Kiilhoyuk. After a two year break, rescue excava- tions at Kfilhyuik were resumed by the Museum of Anatolian Civilizations. Excavations both on the summit and on the slopes revealed Bronze Age ar- chitecture and a series of ovens probably dating to the Early Bronze Age.83 Western and Coastal Anatolia Gok:eada. Excavations were carried out on this north Aegean island by Halime Huryllmaz, and five architectural levels were identified.

In the third level there was a small wall that was partly obscured by the later fortification wall. Single handled cups from this level appear to parallel those of the Troy If period. There were no architectural remains from the fourth level, al- though a fragment of a clay hook of typical north Aegean Early Bronze Age (Troy 1) type, which is also found in Macedonia, was found. There were also no architectural remains from level five. Archaeobotanic research identified remains of wheat, pulses, grape pips, and barley. Faunal analy- sis identified sheep, goat, wolf/dog, rat, and pig bones, as well as mussel shells.84 Bademagacl. The excavations of Refik Duru have now identified five Early Bronze Age architectural levels at this site. One-fifth of the total area of the third Early Bronze Age period town has now been excavated, and a radial settlement plan with mega- ron buildings built side-by-side has been revealed. One of these buildings had two antechambers, and it therefore is not a true megaron. The reason for this is not known and it may have been a gateway or other unique structure. The slope of the hill was covered using small stones and above this was a wall, probably a defensive wall or rampart. The pottery is typical of the Early Bronze Age in western Anatolia and includes high-spouted pitchers, two-handled pitchers, and tripod forms. Many seals and idols were also found. Near the defensive wall, over 300 tear-shaped artifacts, made of limestone a few milli- meters thick, were found. In a later period, a church was built on top of the hill.

Manfred Korfmann, Tiibingen University, reports on the last three years of excava- tions at Bronze Age Troy: A reinvestigation inside the citadel to the east of the well-known Troy II Megaron buildings was made in order to find evidence of earlier build- ings. In 1997, in an area of just 125 m2 and 2.5 m deep, 11 construction phases marked by massive stone foundations were identified. In 1998, fur- ther stratigraphic investigation confirmed the ex- istence of seven layers, previously unnoticed, be- tween Late Troy I and Troy IIc, created by repeat- ed leveling and rebuilding. The orientation of these buildings was generally unchanging, and the ceramics showed a smooth transition from Troy I to Troy II; thus no clear division of the two periods should be drawn. Excavations on the citadel wall near the Troy II Citadel Gate FO in 1997 confirmed architectural continuity between Troy II and III. Therefore, cul- tural continuity can now be shown between Troy I, II, and III, which were previously thought to be dis- crete periods. Widespread along the Sea of Mar- mara and the northern Aegean, we call this entity the "Maritime Troia Culture." In the closing days of the 1998 season a well-preserved megaron build- ing, with plaster walls standing more than 1.5 m high, was found. This had the typical features of a megaron, including a central room and porch, a circular central hearth, and an altar. Radiocarbon dating of some carbonized barley puts the destruc- tion of this megaron at between ca. 2290 and 2200 B.C. In 1999, work continued on the anteroom of the megaron, and the stratigraphy of this area was further clarified. An earlier floor showed that this building had been in use for some time until the building was destroyed by a fire, one of three such sweeping fires that now appear to have affected this part of the site. In my (M.K.'s) opinion, "treasures" came to light from each of these three fire destruc- tion deposits in the old excavations. After the de- struction of Megara IIA and IIB, the main build- ings in the citadel moved to the area east of the (old) gate FO, and smaller buildings were con- structed here. This is neither "impoverishment" nor "a fundamental social change in social struc- ture" as has been previously suggested, and finds from 1999 show continuing wealth. Excavations at the south gate and tower VIi showed that the citadel's most important tower was not built until the end of Troy VI or early Troy VIIa (i.e., ca. 1200 B.C.) Finds relating to cult here and stele found near all of the gates of Troy suggest that cult activities took place at the gates. In the lower town, a number of excavation projects uncovered Bronze Age material. The most impor- tant outcomes were the considerable increase in our understanding of the lower city in the Troy VI period and water supply of ancient Troy. South of the citadel, near the later Odeion, a 5 m wide area of stone paving, dating to Troy VII or VI was found, but its full extent could not be ascer- tained. A massive house of the Late Troy VI period was found, however, and this is firm evidence that such buildings existed in the lower town in this pe- riod. In 1997, in the area to the west of the citadel, burnt layers towards the end of both Troy VI and VlIa period were found; the former destruction was prob- ably caused by an earthquake, and the latter by war. In 1998, three buildings with lime and stone flag flooring, also of Troy VI date, were exposed. Traces of metalworking in Troy VI were found at edge of the lower city area, and 10 kg of Murex shells are evidence of purple dying as part of a sophisti- cated textile industry at the site. In the 14th-12th centuries B.C., large houses with stone foundations were built here and covered a large part of western lower city. Other finds of interest from the Troy VI period included a large rectangular floor paved with stone flags, an infant burial, a clay stamp, faience beads, and a trefoil bone arrowhead. A 20.5 m long east-west trial trench was excavated on the west slope, but no trace of the Troy VI lower city wall could be found in this area. The Troy VI city wall was probably cut away when the Hellenistic city walls were built. Despite this disappointing outcome, a great deal has been learned about the extent and plan of the Troy VI lower city in the period 1997-1999. In 1998 a palisade wall was found in association with mid third millennium B.C. Troy I/II pottery (i.e., Maritime Troia Culture) on the eastern side of the city, identified by means of rock-cut "nega- tive architecture" features. The limits of the lower city can be ascertained because of this bulwark. Only after hundreds of years after removal of this ram- part did new Troy VI occupation begin over this area, including wooden buildings, stone paving, a burnt house with clay walls, and pits with burnt re- mains of wattle walls. There was no further occupa- tion in this area until the Hellenistic period. In 1997-1998, excavations near the northeast- ern bastion reexamined a Late Bronze Age well (4.25 m to a side and over 8 m deep) that had supplied the citadel with its water until about 1100 B.C. The sides of the well had burnt wood cladding, and it had been filled with stones, earth, 2001] 503</page><page sequence="42">ALAN M. GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING charcoal animal bones, and pottery (Troy VIIb2). Although another 3.3 m of deposits remain to be excavated here, for safety reasons, excavation could not be continued. In 1997-1999 excavations were carried out at the 36 m deep Spring Cave and the structures and rock cut basins in front of it, on the western side of the lower city. This consists of a passage, with several branches, that was cut into the rock and into which water seeps. In June to mid Au- gust, ca. 500-1400 It of water a day seeped into the cave from the surface above, and this must have been a vital part of the water supply to the ancient city of Troy for a very long period. These are dated to the third millennium B.C., see below under "Archaeometry." In 1280 B.C., a treaty made between the Hittite king and Wilusa, believed by many to be Troy, in- voked the name of the deity dKASKAL.KUR. This word, KASKAL meaning "path" or "tunnel" associ- ated with KUR meaning "the underworld" or "un- der the ground," obviously refers to this tunnel complex. This may also be the origin of the "beau- tifully" flowing springs and "depressions" in the rock mentioned in Homer, if one assumes that these springs could still be seen in Homer's time (about 720 B.C.). For this and other reasons it is suggested that Homer or his informants were "eyewitnesses" of a ruined site in these days and years. In addition to these Bronze Age works, consider- able excavation of the later periods was made as well as surveys, restoration, and archaeometry (see below, under "Archaeometry"). The identification of the Spring Caves with the dKASKAL.KUR men- tioned in the Wilusa/Hittite treaty of 1280 may strengthen the Wilusa= (W)Ilios (i.e., Troy) equa- tion and further our understanding of the histori- cal geography of western Anatolian in the Hittite period.87 Panaztepe. A. Erkanal's excavations at this impor- tant Bronze Age cemetery site have continued to produce impressive and important results. The site was apparently once an island but is now connected to the mainland as a result of silting.

Interim reports in Turkish appeared in KST19 (1998) 427-53; KST20 (1999) 357-70; KST21 (2000) 287-98. A new guidebook, Troia: A Guide to Troia (1997), by the director and staff of the excavations, is also material has also been found. The Middle Bronze Age graves were organized in rows and had a square base of stones with a raised circle of stones in the middle. Inhumations in jars were placed in the cen- ter. Although grave goods have not been found in all the graves, where they do exist they are of great in- terest. For example, in grave CF, in addition to bone fragments, bronze items and gold and carnelian beads were found. Other finds include pottery, spin- dlewhorls, mussel shells, and a sealstone.88 Ulucak Hoyuk-Kemalpa4a. Altan (ilingiroglu, Zafer Derin, and Esref Abay report: The Early Bronze Age is the second cultural lev- el found in the middle of the mound. In the 1999 excavation season the irregular remains of stone foundations were found and removed in areas O11 and N12. Beneath the topsoil in area N11, in the west of squares a and b, a 5 x 0.6 m stretch of stone foundation, belonging to a square Early Bronze Age building, was found. Inside and outside of the Early Bronze Age build- ing, sherds of dark-faced slipped and burnished pottery with colors ranging from brown to black came to light. Small finds included slingstones and carefully made stone axes. Liman Tepe. Excavations under the direction of H. Erkanal continued at the important Early Bronze Age to Middle Bronze Age transitional site of Liman Tepe. In recent years, work has concentrated on the southern area of the site, where a section of a mas- sive defensive structure was excavated in previous seasons. The new excavations have now extended this structure, which proved to be a massive bastion tower, approximately 20 m wide. This was built of slightly battered (inclined) stonework made of small and medium-sized stones and may have had a stairwell in it. A continuation of this very impressive defensive wall and bastion system was identified, by means of aerial photography and underwater surveying, in the sea to the north of the site. These defenses appear to have used the same construction tech- nique as those on land and at other contemporary sites. A new program of underwater research and excavation is due to start on this part of the site in the near future. available in German.

Excavations in previous seasons had uncovered a 20 m long Early Bronze Age corri- dor house, which would appear to be an important part of the central function of this community, pos- sibly being the seat of political, religious, or eco- nomic authority. The scale of the remains and social organization seen at Liman Tepe is quite unlike any- thing so far identified in the western Aegean. South of the Early Bronze Age bastion, Middle Bronze Age deposits were found, including an egg- shaped amphora or jar. This area, to the south of the EB walled settlement, appears to have been the site of a Middle Bronze Age lower town. Some disturbed Late Bronze Age deposits were also found, including a child buried in a pot of Troy VIIb type. This was the first time that such material had been found at Liman Tepe, and this period will be investigated further in future campaigns.89 Bakla Tepe. Beneath Byzantine tombs, Early Bronze Age levels were found. These included pithos burials and a cist burial, lined with large stones blocks and with a pithos set upright beside it. There were also flexed inhumations, wearing silver ornaments and accompanied by pottery and bronze weapons and pins. These date to the EB 2- 3 periods.

Excavations and research have contin- ued here under the general directorship of V. von Graeve. Of most relevance to this article are the continuing excavations at the Temple of Athena site, which have yielded important new discoveries from the late Chalcolithic and Bronze Age periods. W.-D. Niemeier reports on the major outcomes of the work carried out by himself and Barbara Niemei- er, Heidelberg University, and their team (includ- ing the author, A.G.): Since 1995, the excavations in the area of the Temple of Athena at Miletos have shown that the so-called first building period of the earlier exca- vations was not the earliest phase of human set- tlement here, but the fourth. Thanks to an effec- tive pump system, the following settlement se- quence could be established. Miletos I: Late Chal- colithic (second half of the fourth millennium B.C.); Miletos II: Early Bronze Age (third millen- nium B.C.); Miletos III: Middle Bronze Age (ca. 1900-ca. 1750/20 B.C.); Miletos IV (end of Mid- 89Interim reports have appeared in KST19 (1998) 379-98; KST20 (1999) 325-36; KST21 (2000) 251-62. A report on metallurgical analysis of objects from the site is presented by dle Bronze Age to beginning of Late Bronze Age, ca. 1750/20 B.C.-second half of 15th century B.C.); Miletos V (middle Late Bronze Age, sec- ond half of 15th century-ca. 13th century B.C.). Miletos VI (late Late Bronze Age, ca. 1300 B.C.- ca. 1100 B.C.). (Absolute dates according to the Aegean high chronology.) There is evidence that Miletos, which is situated at the mouth of the Maeander/Biuyuk Menderes valley, formed from the very beginning an impor- tant gateway in the trade between Anatolia and the Aegean. Finds of obsidian in the levels of Miletos I and in Late Chalcolithic Aphrodisias appear to in- dicate that Melian obsidian was traded through Miletos into Anatolia. Miletos II had contact with the Cyclades as imports of Cycladic pottery and the head of an early Cycladic II figurine of the Dokathis- mata variety indicate. Most probably, Cycladic trad- ers came to Miletos to acquire the metals in which Anatolia is so rich. The finds from the levels of Miletos III demon- strate that contacts between Miletos and Crete and a Minoan presence at Miletos started as early as the 19th century B.C., indicated by imports of Kamares pottery of the MM IB-IIB periods, locally produced Minoan domestic pottery, and two seals and a clay sealing. Finds of local southwest Anatolian pottery appear to indicate that a considerable proportion of the population of Miletos III was formed by na- tive people, but the seals and the sealing suggest an important role for the Minoans in Miletos III, which was probably a center for trade in metals be- tween Anatolia and Crete. Miletos IV was almost completely Minoan. More than 95% of the pottery is Minoan. There are frag- ments of countless Minoan-type conical cups. Many more fragments of fresco with Minoan ico- nography, style, and technique have been found. Linear A inscriptions incised on locally produced vessels demonstrate the active use of Linear A at Miletos IV. The most interesting find from Mile- tos IV is a sanctuary that had a mudbrick altar with four phases, three Minoan seals, and fragments of Minoan-type cult vessels of clay and stone. Mi- letos IV had two subphases. The first one ended in a destruction that happened in connection with the Thera eruption, as tephra was found in the destruction level. The second destruction in LMII/LHIIB was probably warlike and caused by conquering Mycenaeans, because Miletos V had an almost completely Mycenaean character. E. Kaptan in ArkST8(1998) 83-102.

GREAVES AND BARBARA HELWING Miletos V-VI is most probably the Millawanda of Hittite sources. The most interesting finds of Mi- letos V were three potters' kilns. The destruction of Miletos V is dated by Mycenaean pottery to the end of LHIIIA:2 which corresponds to the histor- ical date of the destruction of Millawanda by the troops of Hittite Great King Mursili II ca. 1315 B.C. of Miletos VI and the "Dark Ages" unfortu- nately no undisturbed levels have as yet been found.90 Torball-Bademgedigi Hoyiigii. Here rescue ex- cavations were carried out on the north side of the hill in advance of the construction of the Izmir-Ay- din motorway by Recep Meric; of Dokuz Eylil Uni- versity in Izmir. R. Meric is the excavator at the clas- sical site of Metropolis, nearby and to the south, and a brief report on his excavations here was in- cluded in the Metropolis Bulletin for 2000. A 750 m long section of a broad (4 m) Late Bronze Age wall of "Cyclopean" stone construction was found. A sondage was made near the north gate and five levels were distinguished. Late Bronze Age material was found, including pottery from the 12th-14th centuries B.C., arrowheads, and stone axes. Many sherds of "Local Mycenaean" pottery were also found and, in the third level, several sherds of Mycenaean Late Helladic IIIc (early) pottery. In the deepest, fifth level were some fragments of red Middle Bronze Age pottery. The Mycenaean pottery was identified by Pene- lope Mountjoy, whose article on the Mycenaeans in western Anatolia Turkey in the first edition of the new-look Anatolian Studies is discussed above. On the basis of Hawkin's article presented in the same journal, Meric has identified Bademgedigi Hoyiig with the "Puranda" of the Hittite texts. IRON AGE Eastern Anatolia $anllurfa. Since 1998, Fikri Kulakoglu, Ankara University, has carried out a surface survey of first- millennium B.C. sites in this region, and reports here on the most important new discoveries: Late Hittite cultural remains have previously been found at several sites in the $anllurfa region; these were visited again as part of our new survey. For example, in the small village of G6lplnan, two basalt relief stele bearing a figures standing on a 90An interim report on the 1994-1995 seasons appeared in AA (1997) 189-248 and another is expected in a forthcoming issue of the same journal.

Kulakoglu) bull and a stag had been found previously and are now on display in $anllurfa Museum. During the survey we found other sculptures in a different style from this village. The first one is a piece from a statue of a royal figure, measuring 22 x 34 cm. Only the nape of the neck is preserved, although it is clear that it has Assyrian style of hairdressing (see fig. 18). The second piece that we discov- ered during the survey is a part of an orthostat, 50 x 57 cm in size, bearing a lion and an inscription in West Semitic language carved on a basalt slab. Although important sculptures had previously been found at Kabahaydar village, including a dou- ble bull-shaped basalt base, no new sculptural re- mains were found here. At Mehmedihan of Viransehir, where another double bull-shaped base had also been found previously, several new fragments of carved stones and traces of settlement were found. A piece of a statue and almost half of a stele were found in secondary use built into walls. In the center of the village some traces of walls were found, built into which can be seen the hind part of a bull. It is not very clear if this is in situ or not, although a test trench may prove this in the future. Another village that we visited was Aslanli, 19 km west of Siverek. During construction work on the mound a colossal sculpture was found (see fig. 19). The sculpture, which is 2.05 m long, 45 cm wide, and 90 cm in preserved height, reminds us of the colossal gate sculptures of Assyria. One kilometer south of Aclgoz, traces of settle- ment and unfinished or prepared stones for carv- eral themed articles have now appeared, e.g., Niemeier 1997, 1998; Niemeier and Niemeier 1999.

It is clear that strong evidence of Late Hittite culture was present in the $anlurfa region, with the evidence from Kabahaydar and G6lpinarl tak- ing this line of attestations far eastward. Assyrian influence can be seen in the Aslanli colossal sculp- ture and other sculptures found in the area, and further investigations will shed light on the histor- ical geography of the region.9' Mezraa Teleilat. A large group of Iron Age figu- rines were found here this year. These were mold- ed and painted and include female figurines, hors- es, and riders. One female figurine is holding a baby, and another unique example shows a god- dess on the back of a horse. The context of these figurines is not clear as they are not in situ, but it is suggested by the excavator, M. Ozdogan, that there may have been a sacred building here that has yet to be found or has since been destroyed. Central and Western Anatolia Bogazkoy. Jiirgen Seeher reports on the Iron Age phase of the former Hittite capital: New settlers came to the site of Bogazk6y shortly after the abandonment of the Hittite settlement, in the 12th century B.C. at the start of the "Dark Ages." The material culture of their small settlement, which lay on the ridge of Bliyukkaya in the northeastern part of the Hittite city, is completely different to that 91 For a preliminary report on the 1998 season, see AST 17 (2000) 1-10 (in Turkish), and a study of the Late Hittite sculp- of Hittite Imperial culture. The pottery of this peri- od is handmade and has a completely different range of forms; nevertheless, in the oldest levels there is still some wheelmade pottery and some shapes that are connected to earlier Hittite forms. The Iron Age at Bfiyiikkaya is divided into five levels. The first two levels represent the Dark Age or Early Iron Age and are dated by radiocarbon to the 12th-10th centuries B.C. Many elements of the "Dark Age" local tradition pottery maintain elements of the Early and Middle Bronze Age central Anatolian repertoire, and the site was occupied by squatters rather than conquer- ors in this period. In the third, a large settlement of small, often single-roomed, mudbrick buildings on stone foundations, which were often semisubterra- nean, was built on the Biiyikkaya ridge. With radio- carbon dates belonging to the 10th to ninth centu- ries B.C., this is the earliest Middle Iron Age settle- ment at Bogazkoy. The fourth Biyfikkaya Iron Age level continued seamlessly from the fourth and is contemporary with the first half of the Biiyfikkale II ("Older Phrygian") period. Noteworthy is a small fortress on the upper plateau, whereas most of the remaining areas of Bfiyfikkaya were left out in this period, and settlers most likely moved to join with those in the lower city and Bfiyikkale area. The fifth Iron Age level, contemporaneous with Biiyfikkale IIa and I, is only represented by stray finds. Recent finds of Iron Age artifacts from Bogazk6y include crucible fragments, metal tools, and a fine bull figurine, although this may be from a Hittite ture of $anhurfa has appeared in Mikasa 1999, 167-81 (in English, with color illustrations). 507 2001 ]</page><page sequence="46">ALAN M.

The Iron Age/Phrygian lev- els of this site are described above, under "Bronze Age: Eastern, Northern, and Central Anatolia." Kerkenes Dag. Dr. Geoffrey D. Summers and Francoise Summers, Middle East Technical Univer- sity (ODTU), Ankara, report on the 1997 to 1999 seasons: In the seasons up to 1999, the plan of the city was greatly extended by nonintrusive remote sensing techniques, such as aerial photography and a sophis- ticated global positioning system (GPS) to make a highly detailed map that now covers 80% of the city. A fluxgate gradiometer survey, now extending over one-third of the city, revealed subsurface features in remarkable detail. Computer generated simulations are produced by combining the different data sets in a geographical information system (GIS). The 7 km defensive circuit was pierced by a total of seven gates. The city was planned, urban space being divided into blocks that contain discrete sets of buildings. Zoning within the city is also becom- ing evident, as is the scale and complexity of water management. In 1999, work began to clear fallen stones from around the area of the Cappadocia Gate and from the eastern facade of a palatial complex. The Cappa- docia Gate was singled out for this clearance opera- tion because of its proximity to the exceptional com- plexes in the southern area of the city, and because it was the only gate with a well-preserved side cham- ber. The gate, which is flanked by a double tower on the southeast and a single tower on the northwest, has great visual impact. Clearance work to the west of the gate uncovered a 32 m long section of stone gla- cis (sloping defensive bank), 4 m high and angled at 60?. To the east of the gate, a 6 m long section was cleared. Here the glacis was also 4 m high, but was more steeply inclined, at 80?. The gate passage it- self was 6.2 m wide. These defenses were erected on a natural bed of red gritty clay that had probably been leveled to form a base. The facing stones of the glacis were unusual- ly large (up to 1.5 m in height), but they were never- theless skillfully arranged in a kind of cyclopean stonework. There are no true courses, and the fac- ing stones retain a rubble core. Dry stone construc- tion was used throughout and the interstices between the neatly fitted large stones are finely chinked with small- to medium-sized stones. At the topmost level it is assumed that the glacis face extended for anoth- er meter before meeting the vertical face of a now missing structure. A huge amount of stone had fall- en from the top of the walls and this almost certainly confirms that the upper wall was built of stone. Signs of burning from the conflagration that destroyed the Iron Age city could be seen in several locations. The upper stone wall appears to have been deliberately pushed over shortly after the destructive fire. Clearance work was also carried out on the east- ern side of the facade of the so-called palace com- plex (fig. 20). Here again the stone glacis stood 4 m high and showed signs of burning. Future work will be needed to confirm the location of the main entrance to the palace complex, which does not now appear to have been in the deep central niche of the glacis facade on this side. 508 [AJA 105</page><page sequence="47">ARCHAEOLOGY IN TURKEY Also in 1999, a program of geomorphological research was initiated, aimed at documenting the evolution of the Kanak Su Basin and the impact that the construction of this massive 250 ha site on Kerkenes Dag must have had on the environment.92 Gordion. There were no new archaeological ex- cavations at Gordion in recent years, and activities have been concentrated on the continuation of the regional survey, architectural conservation works, and the preparation and opening of the new site museum. Despite the great depth of allu- vium in some parts of the survey region (in places up to 12 m of alluvium has accumulated since an- tiquity), three new sites were identified to the east of Gordion: one early Bronze Age and Chalcolith- ic, one Phrygian, and one Hellenistic-Roman. Restoration focused on the terrace building four, which is an eighth-century building that had been used for food and cloth production. A previous experimental method of wall-capping, the "raised core procedure," had proven to be so successful that the unsightly cement capping originally used to protect the other half of one of the terrace house buildings from degradation was removed and re- placed with this new wall-capping method. The new museum has displays that trace the history of Gordion from the Early Bronze Age through to the Roman period and includes a single large dis- play of the typical contents of one of the Phrygian period terrace houses.93 Daskyleion. On the southeastern slope of the Hisartepe mound, a 100 m long section of a 5 m wide x 4.5 m high section of rampart wall was found. Although the building method employed on this wall bears some similarities to the walls at Troy VI and Liman Tepe (see above, under "Bronze Age: Western and Coastal Turkey") the excavator, Tom- ris Bakir, suggests a Phrygian date for this site based on the number of Phrygian artifacts found in the immediate vicinity of the wall. These included frag- ments of Phrygian inscription, grey pottery with Phrygian graffiti, and painted, black-burnished and greyware Phrygian pottery. A 5 m wide projec- tion from the wall is probably a bastion, although it may also have been a gate. Later, this area was leveled off with a layer of soil and an Achaemenid period wall was built. 92Annual reports have appeared in KST19 (1998) 627-59 (which has a detailed bibliography of other publications at the end) and Ara4ST 14:331-58. A Web site exists for Kerkenes Dag at http://www.edu.tr/home/wwwkerk, and a magazine, Kerkenes News, reporting on recent developments at the site, is published annually. Boztepe. Excavations were carried out here by Bradley Parker as part of the Upper Tigris Ilisu rescue area. In a sounding, Hellenistic pits were found cut into earlier Iron Age building levels. Domestic equipment was recovered, including loomweights, five small bowls and pedestals, and an elaborate stand. Other discoveries at the site are discussed above under "Neolithic." ARCHAEOMETRY As mentioned above in the introduction and "Bronze Age: Western and Coastal Anatolia," a com- plex series of caves and water basin was excavated at Troy from 1997 to 1999. These caves were in effect a "mine for water" that must have been an important element of the city's water supply. The caves appear to have been ancient in origin, but no prehistoric finds were made, probably as a result of washing ac- tivity in the Roman period. It was, however, possible to date the sinter (a calcareous deposit formed by springs) that had accumulated slowly on the ex- posed bedrock in microfine layers since it was first excavated and water began to flow through it (fig. 2). The sinter was dated by the Radiometry Research Station at the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences, with the earliest date being in the first half of the third millennium B.C., that is, the time of the "Maritime Troia Culture" (fig. 3) and ending in Roman times. DENDROCHRONOLOGY At Kiltepe-Kani5, dendrochronology samples have already provided a date of 1810 B.C. for the Palace of Warsama in the Karum Ib period. New dendrochronology samples have now been taken from oak timbers in the Old Palace of the Karum II period. As yet, the sequence from these sam- ples cannot be matched with any others from the site. However, a 627-year continuous chronology for the Early to Middle Bronze Age from 2660 to 2033 B.C. has now been formed using samples of juniper wood from the Old Palace and connect- ing them with similar samples from the northwest trench at Acemh6yiik. There is also the potential for this connection to finally be connected with existing chronologies that extend as far as the Iron Age. Dendrochronology was also used at Kilise Tepe, see above.94 93A short report on excavations at the site in 1997 appeared in KST20 (1998) 559-76. 94A report on the results of the Aegean Dendrochronology Project from 1996 to 1997 is presented by P.I.
