<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sacramental Language for Love's Warrant in Browning's "Saul" Joseph A. Diupras David's burgeoning spiritual perception and experience in Browning's "Saul" alters his artistic consciousness and occasions a new consenting language of the heart. While consoling Saul, he mystically apprehends God's incarnate love and instinctively elevates his craft to a sacramental form of artistic utterance. Simply describing this past divine-human en- counter disturbs him further because he has to understand its manifold, haunting implications. Conscious reflection on prior events and on bril- liant mystical enlightenment leads David to "gather the fragments" (I. 201)1 of his experience temporally. He precisely recalls meeting Abner outside Saul's tent, his humble entrance into the tent, the sequence and types of songs he sang, then his intense personal sensation of human and divine love, and finally his departure. He impresses on these past inci- dents a definite structure to enforce his sense of the world in the process of revealing itself. This narrative precision indicates David's calculative comprehension and ordering of what were originally automatic or spon- taneous responses to circumstances. Such a discursive or coercive tech- nique, however, contrasts with his dis-closing or dis-covering the eternal act of creation. His efforts to organize experience and schematize time cannot nullify even stronger impulses to unfold his being-in-the-world, his ongoing temporal participation and potential in that which he inter- prets. Not only does David mark the before unapprehended relations of things in his religious rapture, but also he desires to perpetuate and reflect his continuing care for all reality as the outward and visible sign of God's immanent re-creative love. To signify the inward and spiritual grace seen as sanctifying all existence, he replaces a medium that merely identifies affinities between man and nature with one that actively par- ticipates in their concert. David's impression of nature's strange, anthropomorphic quality when he left Saul affects his subsequent story to a degree that he sacramental- izes events only later understood as religiously connected. His rendition 124</page><page sequence="2">Browning's " 'Saul" 125 may seem objective and reportorial, yet the composition also has com- plementary sacerdotal and figural qualities. By "gather[ing] the frag- ments" (thereby foreshadowing the activities of Christ's disciples in John 6:12 to retrieve scraps of bread and fish), he points up the conse- crated temper of his reminiscence; and by seeking to extend an earlier enthusiasm to his present account of atonement ("In that act where my soul was thy servant, thy word was my word,-/ Still be with me," 11. 194-195), he adds an evangelical dimension to his narration. As a way of representing his new attitude toward reality, David draws analogies between phenomena and his musically conditioning the king to rejoin humanity. He identifies natural rebirths (a serpent sloughing its skin, and a mountain in spring) with the promise and culmination of his role as savior and with Saul's physical condition and spiritual prospects. He also subtly underscores the "sign" that man and creatures are "one family here" (1. 48): first by delineating the lonely isolation of the ser- pent, "Far away from his kind, in the pine, till deliverance come" (I. 32); and then by illustrating the way a loving relationship between spring "And some mountain, the last to withstand her" (1. 105), is consum- mated "in the ardours of summer" (1. 115) with new vitality. This view of the natural world as a symbolic extension of valuable human experi- ence forwards David's awareness of the love binding him to Saul: Then first I was 'ware That he sat. as I say, with my head just above his vast knees Which were thrust out on each side around me, like oak-roots which please To encircle a lamb when it slumbers. (11. 222-225) These figurative comparisons of the meeting to a world seemingly per- meated with love and purpose display David's new religious and artistic maturity; in the words of Nathan Scott, Jr. about sacramental vision, he has begun "a relationship to all the things and creatures of the earth that is grounded in a dialectic of reciprocity, of exchange, of love . . . . "2 David did not draw these analogies between man and nature specifically for Saul; they represent a later transformation of inchoate impressions into poetic, sacramental figures. He understands what he only experi- enced earlier. The charms of music and of "mere living" (1. 78) do not remove Saul from the limbo between a death-like trance and meaningful, vital pur- suits. Having quickened Saul's sensitivity to earthly existence on only an aesthetic plane, the troubled David wonders "what spell or what charm" can "sustain" Saul "where song had restored him" (11. 127- 129). Since song restores Saul's awareness of only physical joys, David needs to point him toward a goal which will make actions publicly, if not yet spiritually, rewarding and meaningful. But David's anxiety also</page><page sequence="3">126 The Journal of Narrative Technique stems from the difficulty of finding a medium which does more than describe life's "mere fruitage, the strength and the beauty" (1. 131). When once again David's "harp made response to [his] spirit" (1. 147), he can suggest metaphorically the secular honor he envisions for Saul. He reveals that the king's life may be not only self-satisfying but also socially beneficial. For the first time in section 13, nature is seen as providing more than simple enjoyment to man (as represented in stanzas five, six, and nine); it now becomes a sign of human maturation. David's trope about the development of a palm tree accents the evolution and climax of Saul's social sensibilities beyond life's physical pleasures. This analogy begins David's turning from a mediate language, sufficiently forceful to convey rational thought, to an immediate or sacramentalizing language, which discloses the spiritual communion of creation and Creator. Nathan Scott's study of sacred reality, as it is perceived by the spiritual imagina- tion and artistically expressed, again proves illuminating: " . . . this imagination of reality as a vast antiphony rests . . . upon a lively intu- ition that both the human and the nonhuman modes of existence are animated and empowered by some primal reality, which may be denomi- nated simply as Being itself" (p. 85). Because conscious and unconsci- ous forms of life alike celebrate inward and spiritual grace, David freely crosses their boundaries to emphasize the radical identity between Saul and all being. Saul needs assurance that his destiny and primordial na- ture are essentially coextensive, c6operant to an end, before he can hope to realize that a sacred force drives his soul as well as all other finite existence. Through stanza 13, by way of "tunes" and a "charm," David does "the best [he] could do" (1. 226) to console Saul; he re-energizes the monarch's genial spirits by "touch[ing] on the praise/ [He] foresaw from all men in all time, to the man patient there" (11. 220-221). Having achieved all he can musically, David can dispose of his harp (1. 222). This marks a turning point in "Saul" in that David recognizes his psy- chotherapy only partly represents the exchange of grace possible among men. The music from the harp cannot adequately accommodate the mystical experience which is soon to refine his apprehension of the Mysterium Tremendum. On one hand, then, his allowing the harp to fall forward may only imply a completed task; on the other hand, the act may also signal his emerging from disinterestedness about Saul's plight to enter an authentic reciprocity with all experience (including his deep- est sentient self). The harp has to be replaced by an artistry owning a care-ful, hermeneutic potential for de-constructing life's variegated covering and, hence, un-covering Being. As David reveals in stanzas 14 and 15, there was more to his "adven- ture" (1. 193) than foreseeing Saul's societal eminence. Saul's tactile sign of tenderness physically complements the divine aid for David's</page><page sequence="4">Browning's ''Saul" 127 own hopelessness (1. 196). In order to return this affection, David de- sires for Saul a spiritually satisfying "new life," a provision of David's love but not yet fully seen as a token of divine love: And oh, all my heart how it loved him! but where was the sign? I yearned-"Could I help thee, my father, inventing a bliss, "I would add, to that life of the past, both the future and this; "I would give thee new life altogether, as good, ages hence, "As this moment,-had love but the warrant, love's heart to dis- pence!" (11. 232-236) David's very words about longing to give Saul a "new life" beyond man's physical existence constitute just such a verbal "sign" of his new love. They do not disclose, however, the "marvels" (1. 200) and "the terrible glory" (1. 202) which made the "adventure" so provocative; not until he envisages divine love does David's human love fully emerge. The exchange of love between the two men is still a prelude to David's consciousness of this "new life" as a sign or "warrant" of God's love for man. David elliptically formulates the sudden, mystical cognition of union between what he lovingly would do for Saul and what he believes God warrants for all men. This epiphanic moment in stanza 16 radically trans- forms David's style as well as his experience: "Then the truth came upon me. No harp more-no song more! outbroke-." David's new status in the course of events he describes thus suits his substituting entertainment (restricted to holding Saul's attention on human experi- ence between youth and old age, i.e., delighting or refreshing only his aesthetic and social sensibilities) with visionary and sacramentalizing artistry. The eternal "truth" experienced seems to strain against the compressed, paratactic phrasing. The moment of divine revelation in- spires him to find a more suitable medium for speaking and spelling religious "truth." Forceful religious insight generates the four full stops of the line, the intense repetition, and the concurrence of impression ("came upon") and expression ("outbroke"). Apprehending the "truth" about the Incarnation and its fellowship with a "new life" beyond the grave propels him into another, sacred dimension of reality, into the "impenetrable obscurity"3 of his own feelings, and into a new world of sacramental language. Composing his mental and emotional participation in the strange truth of a "new life" with God after death, David does not directly address Saul again until both his reason and intuition are satisfied about the significance and value of that "truth." Introspection and reverence ini- tially cause him to talk about his monarch ("this man," "this Saul," and "the King") instead of to him-an indication that the "truth" is now immediate and affective rather than a precept susceptible to direct trans-</page><page sequence="5">128 The Journal of Narrative Technique mission. This same interplay between reflection and theopathy deter- mines David's catechetic and incantatory style. He tests the intuited affinities between his and God's love for Saul logically, yet his utter- ances in stanzas 17 and 18 attain what Carlyle calls "musical thought." The limitations of his "knowledge" and "forethought" (i.e., reflective consciousness) have prevented David heretofore from doing much more than pronouncing "approval or censure" on "God's work" (11. 241, 242). When the "truth," however, activates a "faculty highest" (1. 247), he can see and convey God's presence "In the star, in the stone, in the flesh, in the soul and the clod" (1. 250). This repeated construction of preposition, article, and substantive rhythmically embodies besides merely denoting David's "musical thought," his penetration into the inmost heart and the inmost mystery of a pantheistic world. This mysti- cal intuition of God, although restricted to a "deity known" in nature, moves David toward proving the significance of His willing "this abounding experience" (1. 255) as sacramentation-the "warrant" of divine love. In the ensuing analogical reasoning from his human love to "God's own speed in the one way of love" (1. 262), he emphatically affirms God's help beyond his own "impotent yearning" (1. 269). David emotionally charges his language with rhetorical questions and chant- like cadences (11. 273 ff.): "such a soul,/ Such a body, and then such an earth," "to save and redeem and restore," "Saul the mistake,/ Saul the failure, the ruin," "the dream, the probation, the prelude," "new light and new life,-a new harmony yet/ To be run, and continued, and ended." These graceful lines (stylistically similar to line 250, quoted above) demonstrate his reunited sensibilities, a totally coordinated effort of reason, imagination, and sensation to capture and sustain in words the open Secret divined in a mystical infinite moment. The Incarnation acquits sacred love's "warrant" of "new life" both religiously and verbally. Experiencing an incarnate, loving God resolves David's sympathies with Saul's material needs, but not at the expense of spirit. Physical existence links man in this life with nature, yet this corporeality is as much subject to redemption (becoming, according to St. Paul in I Corinthians 15:44, "a spiritual body") as the soul. David's transvaluation of man's flesh climaxes in the Incarnation: ' 'T is the weakness in strength, that I cry for! my flesh, that I seek "In the Godhead! I seek and I find it. O Saul, it shall be "'A Face like my face that receives thee: a Man like to me, "Thou shalt love and be loved by, for ever: a Hand like this hand "Shall throw open the gates of new life to Thee! See the Christ stand!" (11. 308-312) This section particularly illustrates the way, according to W. David Shaw, "the poet's words must become a study of the Word."4" The</page><page sequence="6">Browiining's Saul'' 129 above lines echo II Corinthians 12:9: "And he said unto me, my grace is sufficient for thee: for my strength is made perfect in weakness." David "seeks and finds" a loving God Who can "open the gates of new life." This, too, has a scriptural basis and fulfills Christ's promise in Matthew 7:7-8: "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be op- ened." Christ's words also answer David's questions about the affinity of his own human "faculty" to divine love; since David "is faithful in that which is least [and] is faithful also in much" (Luke 16: 10), he finally has both the faith that looks through death and the love that opens the door to "new life" beyond the grave: -xWhat, my soul? see thus far and no farther? when doors, great and small. "Nine-and-ninety flew ope at our touch, should the hundredth appal? "In the least things have faith, yet distrust in the greatest of all? 'Do I find love so full in my nature. God's ultimate gift. "That I doubt his own love can compete with it?" (11. 263-267) Biblical resonances compose David's new awareness of the relation be- tween man's love (bound by the flesh) and God's incarnate love (which transfigures and redeems the flesh). He discovers his own flesh "in the Godhead"; he finds his words in the Word of God. By coupling David's orphic glimpse of divine love with God's revealed "truth," Browning evokes his persona's spiritual zeal ("grace . . . sufficient") and new poetical expertise (God-spell, sacramental expression). The substantives used to identify "the Christ" are not unique to sec- tion 18. The manner of refining the word "Face" contributes in large part to the poem's verbal density and comprehensiveness. Its meaning dilates from merely physical attractiveness-David's "beautiful counte- nance, and goodly to look to" (I Samuel 16:12). A face, according to G. M. Hopkins, "deals out that being indoors each one dwells"; that is, it signifies inward grace. David's face seems to disclose to Saul the essen- tial, natural innocence which has been the subject of David's "tunes" and his "charm." Ultimately it becomes a "warrant" of God's temporal and eternal love for His creations, in Hopkins' words again, that sacred "play in ten thousand places . . . through the features of men's faces." This "Face" is discovered, like the one identified in the conclusion to "An Epistle . . . of Karshish," by a leap of imagination from God's "image" in man to His creative power and loving, redemptive presence in human history. David's climactic reference to God's "Hand" in sec- tion 18 shares the same pattern of repetition (or verbal "gesture") bind- ing phenomenal and supernatural existence. When God's "Hand" helps David to envision "God's throne from man's grave" (1. 198), and when</page><page sequence="7">130 The Journal of Narrative Technique Saul extends his hand to David (both physically and spiritually uniting them), David is granted a private revelation with universal, religious significance. At this point David's mystical perception includes not only "God's hand thro' a lifetime" (1. 85) but also that "hand" in time-that is, both God's spiritual grace in all men's lives and His physical pres- ence as an incarnate Savior among them. Leaving the tent and entering a world already "troubled" by the "new law" which (as a singer-turned- priest) he has engaged, David feels the influence of this "Hand" on his own present life (11. 321-323). These narrative motifs help focus David's sensations of human brotherhood and the spiritual marriage be- tween creature and Creator. David's sacramentalizing imagination, per- ceiving "the Christ" besides Christ of the Gospels, thus sees the Incar- nation not simply as a historical event in the distant future but as a proleptic warrant that telescopes the temporal process. He replaces song with prophecy and a religious aesthetic, which immediately confirm the ubiquitous grace presently and continually dwelling in finitude and tem- porality. The climax to "Saul" unfolds David's sensitivity to the growth of spiritual consciousness and his reflective-yet passionate-re-cognition of the sacred congress between revelation and reality. His depiction of natural phenomena in stanza 19 sacramentalizes "the terrible glory" which heretofore has been only latent in the registering of his impres- sions. Retrospection blends with total consciousness of an experience (and its fruition) when David resolves the sensation of an environment charged with new life, a "new law." He understands that the "rapture," which absorbed him privately, is also embodied universally in the day's tender birth; In the gathered intensity brought to the grey of the hills; In the shuddering forests' held breath; in the sudden windthrills; In the startled wild beasts that bore off, each with eye sidling still Though averted with wonder and dread .... (11. 325-329) The burden of his message is not only a "salvation [that] joins issue with death" (1. 304) but also a "whole earth" (1. 318) conditioned by "the Christ" being in time. He finds, in Scott's words, " 'the speech of God' in some way articulated in the world in which we live and move and have our being" (p. 48). David does prophesy the Incarnation, but the vision is promptly momentous because he appears to have caused this spiritual event anachronistically-as if language could will the "new law" into being; ironically, the Word is the "new law." His mystical and aesthetic experience is seeing the ever completing world symboli- cally, that is, as sacrament. The "new law" is not enacted by David; rather, this universal Here, everlasting Now, literally dis-covers itself to him for the first time. Reflectively and poetically recapturing (i.e., re-</page><page sequence="8">Browning's "Saul" 131 membering) his previous sensations of spiritual design, he raids the inar- ticulate and sacramentalizes it-"the unuttered" (1. 315), the "quiet" (1. 322), the birds "made stupid with awe" (1. 330), and the "all but hushed voices" (1. 335) of the brooks bespeaking the real, temporal being of the sacred, " 'E'en so, it is so!' " David's mission is to commu- nicate a "new law" which preeminently affects the spiritual "life or death" of mankind. Hence, he narrates his experience thoughtfully, suc- cumbing neither to barren, reductive concepts nor to a prolonged mysti- cal intoxication of the kind disturbing Browning's Lazarus. An "adventure" that begins as a psychotherapeutic effort to relieve Saul's weltschmerz eventually brings David to "God's throne" (1. 198) and to a keener perception of love as the inward and spiritual grace common to and uniting nature, man, and God. Recollecting the "ad- venture" inside and outside Saul's tent, David reveals the temporal, experiential process wherein the separate incidents happened; he also suggests that each occurrence was a broken arc revealing "the Christ." The idea of God's infinite love within a finite human form is both the foremost "fragment" and the animating principle of David's narrative; the "new law" of "new life" begins and informs his renovated lan- guage of love. Furthermore, since "the terrible glory" of God's re- deeming love for all creation is both "past event and present reality" (as William Whitla has commented),5 it saturates and colors David's eidetic memory and evaluation of the entire episode, finally seeming almost to nullify time altogether. A prefigurement of Saul's entry into a "new life" beyond the grave initiates a heightened consciousness of an immediate, revitalizing spiritual presence. Consequently, the symbolic figures David later uses to retrieve, sustain, and sacramentalize numi- nous experience coalesce with the incantatory language whereby he formerly conveyed to Saul man's love for nature, man's love for man, and God's love for man. David progressively refines language to signify a divine-human en- counter which "instresses" the burden of finitude and which also mo- mentously sanctifies him with "new life." Only expressions charged with both perspicacity and enthusiasm allow Browning's perceptive speaker in "Saul" to revive a quickened, multiplied consciousness of the "new law" moving his life and fusing his spiritual and aesthetic faculties. He embraces a congenial tension between aesthetic encounter with the world and rare, intensely spiritual demands to master moments when it gathers to a greatness. His words strive to redeem from decay the visitation of divinity in man. "Saul" displays the sacramental artist- ry that consecrates words with "natural and acquired richness . . . ma- terial color and spiritual transparency" (An Essay on Shelley) to capture the sacred "new law" enlivening both experience and expression.
