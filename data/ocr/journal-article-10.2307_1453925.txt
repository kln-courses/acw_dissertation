After brief introductory remarks (including the prudent observation that what is called "Rabbinic Judaism" was far from a single uniform system), Dr. Schliiter turns to M. AZ 3.3, which prohibits the use of objects carrying "a representation of the sun, a representation of the moon, a representation of a drqwn." It is customary to understand these terms as alternatives and suppose that any one of the three representations made the objects that bore it unusable. Since the context is concerned with avoidance of objects connected with pagan cults, this leads to the question, what was the cultic connection of the drqwn? Therefore Chapters 2 and 3 investigate the use of the word's cognates in classical, Jewish, Christian, and "gnostic" Greek and Latin texts. Of course the common meaning "snake" appears in all, but cultic connections are often found. In search of ties with these, the Rabbinic texts using the word are studied in Chapters 4 and 5, and many are found to be not reflections of historical events but literary constructions. This leaves the question of the cultic relationship open, so Chapter 6 tries to determine what actual pagan cult was the cause of the word's importance. Conclusion: certainty on this question is impossible, but the reference was most likely to the Isis-Serapis cults or to some "gnostic" system in which the serpent functioned as creator of this lower world and could therefore be represented together with the sun and the moon (although such joint representation was not implied). Finally an excursus deals with RaMBaM, the drqwn, and the moon-tly. Twenty-two pages of bibliog- raphy, thirteen of sources cited, and five of general index are welcome additions. The conclusions, although admittedly inconclusive, are not unreasonable, but the argument is the least part of the work, which is really a mini-survey of ancient Mediterranean references to snakes-a snake-pit of irrelevant examples which make the text both dull and hard to follow. The investigation would have been simpler and the results more probable if the authoress had carefully considered the purpose of the ruling in M. AZ 3.3: to prevent Jews from keeping around their houses valuable objects that they were likely to find and that bore any representa- * Margarete Schliiter, 'Deraqo6n' und Gotzendienst: Studien zur antiken jiidischen Religionsgeschichte, ausgehend von einem griechischen Lehnwort in Mishnah Avodah Zarah 111.3 (Judentum und Umwelt, 4).

(Anthropomorphic figures are here passed over as obvious). Since the provision that the offending objects are to be taken to the Dead Sea probably antedates the shift of the Jewish center to Galilee (ca. 135), and certainly supposes objects that are transportable, the proper initial question should have been one for archaeology and not for philology, viz., what portable objects with representations of sun, or moon, or serpent, hence suspect of connection with idolatry, would a Jew have been likely to find in south Palestine before 132 C.E.? Here archaeology is not well informed. Most objects in gold and silver have been lost, many doubtless melted down. Terracottas with figural representations are also rare (after 1200 years of orthodox Jewish and Muslim breakage). Many small statues of local limestone most likely went into the kilns. That leaves coinage and gems as our main bodies of iconographic evidence. On Palestinian coinage serpents never appear as types, and almost never at all (Hill, Greek Coins... B.M., Palestine, Caesarea, p. 21 and pl. III.8; Raphia, pl. XVIII.10 probably shows Nemesis' wheel; Meshorer, Sylloge Numm. gr., A.N.S., Caesarea, pl. 24, nos. 771- 75). This settles it; there was no important official worship of a serpent god. Gems show us the gods of private devotion. The gems of southern Palestine are not collected, but we have Dr. A. Hamburger's Gemsfrom Caesarea Maritima, CAtiqot, vol. 8 (Jerusalem, 1968). Photos 110, 111, 125 show the serpent god Chnoubis haloed and radiant (a fourth example, 112, is not illustrated). He was famous for cures; his lion-head would explain the use of drqwn rather than the common word for "snake"; his rays, which often run down his neck, would explain the later ruling that the prohibited type of drqwn has whiskers (sisit). Another gem (120) shows the famous "ouroboros"-the circular snake with his tail in his mouth-probably representing Time or Aion. (C. Bonner's attempt to demythologize him-Studies in Magical Amulets [Ann Arbor, 1950], p. 250-was an eccentricity; Schltiter should not have trusted it). Other collections show that the ouroboros was a favorite on gems, and he, too, often had whiskers. Here he circles three magical signs, and the reverse of the gem reads IAO, the Greek rendering of YHWH. I think it most likely that the Rabbis' prohibition of objects with snakes on them had, among other things, such gems in mind. Schliiter mentions the role of serpents in magic, and even their appearance (with sun and moon!) on magical rings. However, she dismisses these as merely magical, and gallops off in pursuit of major deities, primaeval monsters, fallen creators, etc., of which, except for the deities, no representations on portable objects are known. And the appearances of the deities on small objects were often on magical gems. Were they then merely magical, too, in spite of the fact that we know from the papyri that such gems were often used in rites of magical worship? In spite of all this, Schltiter's book is by no means useless. It is a fine example of how not to explain a mishnah, and it is a fine collection (though admittedly far from complete) of ancient passages on serpentine monsters with cultic connections. Anyone in search of data on such repulsive divinities should consult it. Columbia University MORTON SMITH</page></plain_text>
