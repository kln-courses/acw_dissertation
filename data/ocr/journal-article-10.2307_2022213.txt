Wien: Springer-Verlag, 1958. iv, 320 pp. $6.20 (DM 26.-). This is a brilliant and illuminating study by Professor Topitsch, of the University of Vienna, which shows that the traditions of the Vienna Circle are not entirely dead in their place of origin despite the changed picture of the times. The author was in this country (1954-55) on a Rockefeller fellowship at Harvard University where he collected material for the completion of this book, which was preceded by a number of articles on the subject in German philosophical journals. The book may be considered as one of the most important philosophical writings of the last decades in Ger- man. Professor Philipp Frank, who is not given to rash state- ments, said in a communication to the author that the book con- tituted the first progress over the ideas of the Vienna Circle in the last two or three decades. While the book is written within the traditions or spirit of the Vienna Circle, it is independent of it in the sense that Topitsch is a worker in humanities while the main representatives of the Circle worked within the bounds of logic, mathematics, physics, and the philosophy of science. Professor Topitsch mentioned in a letter addressed to this reviewer that while the Vienna Circle would describe metaphysics as senseless (which might be correct from a purely logical standpoint), he tries to understand its import from an historical and genetic standpoint, from the point of view of sociology of culture. A few people of the original Vienna Circle like Zilsel and Neurath tried something similar but did not proceed very far with it owing to a lack of training in the humanities. (Topitsch was originally a classic scholar who wrote on Latin literature.) Topitsch says that his work fulfills an old desideratum of the Vienna Circle which got into a backwater because of the prevalence of the purely logistic and semantical viewpoints of the school of Carnap. Professor Frank, of course being familiar with the origins of the movement, knows better and made his remark in such a vein. Topitsch tries to show the mythological origin of metaphysical thought-i.e., to show that the models of thought prevalent in mythology continued to predominate in metaphysics. His sociology of world views, his criticism of ideologies have on German soil such predecessors as Wilhelm Dilthey and Max Weber. The models of mythological thought, Topitsch holds, were worked out on similar lines in many cultures-in the Orient, in the Middle East,</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 623 in pre-Columbian America, etc.; but mythological thought had its greatest flowering in the ancient empires of Egypt, Mesopotamia, and Greece. The main features of mythological thought appear in a more refined and rationalized form in Greek philosophical speculation, in the pre-Socraties, in Plato and Aristotle, to some extent in the Atomists, in the Stoics, and in the important Graeco-Roman popu- lar philosophy of the Hellenistic world, in the speculations of Philo and the Neo-Platonists. The basic pattern was not changed even in Christian philosophy, in the metaphysics of the Renaissance, of the Enlightenment, and in German metaphysics (from Kant to Hegel). The basic structure of metaphysical thought retained its main features as they were worked out in Greece. It may be added here that the analysis of Greek philosophy in this sense is the most fascinating part of the study, its real core. The author thinks that it was the transformation of our society, the industrial revolution, and the age of science that destroyed the productivity of metaphysical thought. This mythologico-metaphysical thought has three basic models: biomorphous, sociomorphous and technomorphous. Types of meta- physics are in the main reducible to these three types (except mysticism). The attribution of biological processes to the universe, i.e., the biomorphous model, is the most primitive one (as, for in- stance, when it is said that the world is born of an egg). But this model reappears, for instance, in Neoplatonism to some extent. The main models are, however, sociomorphous and technomorphous, and these models are called here the "intentional world view," a view derived from planned willing and acting, with its norms, objects, and products, proceeding on the assumption that the world is ruled by some plan of action, by a blueprint of purpose. Such "intention" is then imputed to the cosmos. If the laws of the cosmos are abstracted from social relations (family, state), they are sociomorphous; if from familiar craftsmanship or artistic ac- tivity, they are technomorphous. Thus the famous Aristotelian theory of causality with its multiplicity of causes may be under- stood from the standpoint of a craftsman working with the ma- terials of his craft. Plato's models are mainly sociomorphous. Intentional models are of the essence in the Jewish and Chris- tian religions. It is from such a viewpoint that the creation of the world is described here, while biomorphous models of creation are rejected. When Greek speculation entered the Jewish and the Christian world, the patterns of religious thought met only with another phase of the same intentional world view, so that neither Philo nor the Christian thinkers, from Origenes and Augustine,</page><page sequence="3">624 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY changed the inherited patterns of Greek philosophy. In the Renaissance there was only a shift from Aristotelianism to other ancient sources such as Platonism, Neoplatonism, and Stoicism. In the Orphic and Pythagorean speculations, biomorphous models were of great weight. If speculation becomes mystical, it tries not to explain or to justify but to transcend the world; thus mysticism (in Neoplatonic or medieval forms) tries to transcend the intentional world view, but this trend never had the importance of the latter in the Western world. The intentional world had originally not a theo- retical but a pragmatic import. Man wanted to know whether the universe was friendly or inimical, how to behave in the face of it, etc. Metaphysics, mythology, religion mirror the struggle for an answer to these questions and are a sort of explanation or apotheosis, i.e., justification, of the world. As Heinrich Rickert said, metaphysics is basically a valuational world view. Ontologi- cal speculation would be uninteresting without such a valuational background and this is what the intentional world view is: a pre- conceived system of value superimposed on the world so that it becomes "familiar." The last flowering of this view was the Enlightenment, as it stressed natural religion, natural law, natural morals, natural order, etc. The idea of an all-embracing world law-the natural or cosmic law-that rules the cosmos and trans- forms it into a valuationally rational (i.e., satisfactory) structure is the basic feature of the intentional world view. Of course, this structure may often be at variance with reality as experienced by man, which is often valuationally irrational, i.e., unjust, cruel in a human sense. (The study of natural law is at the source of this study by Topitsch.) Cosmodicies, logodicies, theodicies are con- strued to solve the contradiction between this imagined supreme law of the universe-which is supremely good-and the obvious fact of existing evil, as well as the antinomy between the postulate of human freedom and an all-powerful world law. The natural law is nothing else than a projection of social con- ditions on the cosmos, whereby a second cosmical "scheme of action'" is superimposed on the human action pattern. This second scheme is then said to be the eternally valid divine source of all human laws, to which they ought to conform. But the valuational contents of a metaphysics are always presupposed, so that a circularity of proof must always arise in this respect. If natural law has any contents at all, i.e., if a determinate value is there, it is presupposed; but it is often merely an empty formula (Leerformel) or a tautology-for instance "suum cuique, " the categorical imperative, etc., which may be filled in with any</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 625 content. As a result of this construction of a second "scheme of ac- tion," pseudo-problems arise. Thus the supreme law requires that the cosmocrator-whatever form he assumes-should be all powerful; but then he becomes the author of all human actions, the good and the bad ones alike. Also, to be responsible the hu- man agent should have a degree of autonomy; otherwise, ethics becomes impossible. Thus the problem of the freedom of the will is an internal problem of interference within the intentional world view. Heinrich Gomperz showed that we invest the relation of causality with the anthropomorphic features of coercing and forc- ing, so that human actions become forced or coerced if their causality is assumed. But without such anthropomorphic connota- tions and their reprojection from general causality upon human action, the problem would not arise at all. The intentional view assumes a world plan. In Bossuet, his- torical development realizes a world plan of salvation. This idea seems secularized in Voltaire, so that the world plan describes the progress of the human spirit toward an age of reason. Neverthe- less, it is the same world plan in another form, and the intentional structure is identical, therefore, even in the Enlightenment, only its tendency is different. But the Enlightenment is Janus-like; it also turns away from the intentional world view and introduces the age of science. Hegel's philosophy is within the framework of the intentional world view; it describes a planned evolution of the world spirit, its self-realization. This intentional structure re- mained intact in Marxism, although it was reversed materialisti- cally. Marxism also assumes a definite tendency in evolution, with its characteristic of a planned necessity, but it is, like the En- lightenment, a phenomenon of transition; it is an ideology within the structure of the intentional world view, but it denies this fact and claims purely scientific validity. The intentional world view-i.e., metaphysics-had to disappear with the disappearance of the social order which fostered it, when the states ceased to be monarchies in the old sense, when the human family lost its original coherence, when even birth and death ceased to be a living experience, when production ceased to be handicraft, when the models from which the intentional world view drew its inspiration became obsolete and lost their explanatory power. Thus the metaphysical stronghold of the intentional world view in philosophy had to crumble. Topitsch builds his synthesis on the basis of an enormous literature which he quotes. That Greek philosophy continued the models of Greek religion was previously expressed by Karl Joel and F. M. Cornford. The theory of the emptiness of natural-law</page><page sequence="5">626 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY formulas and of Kant 's imperative was worked out by Hans Kelsen. Topitsch acknowledges their contribution, but gives high- est praise to Heinrich Gomperz as the one who really grasped all the main features of the intentional world view. Gomperz published in this country articles on this subject, but died before being able to organize his insight into a book. While mentioning Cornford, Topitsch does not mention the lat- ter's main study, From Religion to Philosophy, where Cornford, who adopted the views of the French sociological school (Durk- heim, MLvy-Bruhl, etc.), said that there was "an inward and substantial affinity" between religion and philosophy and that "if we now call it 'metaphysical' instead of 'Supernatural' the thing itself has not essentially changed its character." "Behind Philosophy," Cornford stresses, "lay religion, behind religion . . . lies social custom-the structure and institutions of the hu- man group." "The eternal laws, of which Antigone said that no one knew from whence they were proclaimed, can now be seen to have been projected, as a sort of Brocken spectre, from those very laws of state with which she contrasts them." Topitsch 's book has an importance in the German-speaking world transcending that of a technical study in philosophy. He intends it to be understood as a document to the eff3ect that Europe has not only "existentialist mannerism" (as Walter Cerf called it in this JOURNAL) or Christian restoration. He is, of course, in accord with the Vienna Circle in the struggle against what could be called "neo-obscurantism." His book means a strengthening of the enlightened liberal forces in the German- speaking world. It shows that the original fire of the Vienna Circle has not spent itself.
