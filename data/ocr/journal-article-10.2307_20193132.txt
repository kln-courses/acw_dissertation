<plain_text><page sequence="1">A decade of sexism in readers DIANNE BENNETT GRAEBNER Former newspaper reporter Dianne Bennett Graebner is a writer for the Office of College Relations, State University College, Fredonia, New York. She has taught English and journalism at secondary and college levels. In this article NOW member Graebner examines school reading texts and their adjustment (or lack of it) to changing life styles. "1VTY FRIEND Ernest would be * "* my copilot. Linda could be the stewardess." "In the house there was a shop where the little old man made shoes. The little old woman helped him." 'Ted likes to hike. Jill sits with Nan. Bill rides a bike. What can Ben hit?"1 In these excerpts from ele mentary readers, the female is portrayed as being in a typical oc cupation, subordinate to a male, and in a relatively passive state. That these quotations are all from the newest editions of school read ers is indicative of the conclusion of this study: school readers have not kept pace with a changing so ciety. The role of woman, as drawn in elementary readers, has changed very little over the past decade. To examine the question of whether school readers reflect a changing female role, 554 stories in elementary reading books were studied. The series used were Scott, Foresman and Co., 1962-63 and 1971 editions, and Ginn and Co., 1961 and 1969 editions. (In future references, the 1961-63 readers are referred to as "old" editions; the 1969 and 1971 ones as "new" editions. Scott, Foresman is abbreviated as SF.) The study shows that boys dominate the story texts and pictures in the new editions as well as the old (see Figures 1 and 2). The boys out number the girls as major charac ters in stories (old 71.1 percent; new 75 percent) and in illustra 52 The Reading Teacher October 1972</page><page sequence="2">tions (old 58.1 percent; new 67.5 percent). The statistics compiled covered various characteristics common to each sex ? types of clothing as well as psychological traits. Care ful attention was given to border line cases. In the new editions, boys are shown slightly more often in passive roles; at the same time girls have lost ground in per centage of active roles. Boys are also slightly more dependent in the new versions. There is also a slight tendency toward more sex stereotyping in the new readers (Figure 3). Even allowing for dif ferences in judgment in evaluat ing the old and new books, there has apparently been no effort to make the activities of males and females any less typed by sex. Changes old to new One of the major changes from the old to new versions is that mother wears an apron or carries a dishtowel less often: 42 percent in the old versions, 12.8 percent in the new ones. More girls are shown in casual wear or slacks in the newer books (33 percent of the time compared to 26.7 per cent of the time in the old books).2 These changes, while they are superficial, are nonethe less important in reflecting the changing role of women. The greatest difference between the old and new editions is in the number of occupations for fe males. In all editions, women are underemployed compared to their rate of employment in the labor market.3 Nonetheless, there is a shift to more varied and frequent employment in the new books. Women are shown in only five oc cupations in the old books and in twenty-six in the new ones, an in crease of more than 400 percent (Figure 4). Men are shown in thirty-eight jobs in the old books, in seventy-three in the new ones, an increase of almost 200 per cent. A woman's job, however, is usually portrayed only once (queens, princesses and unmar ried teachers excepted), whereas male occupations appear repeated ly (policemen, barbers, business men, firemen, etc.). It is seldom, also, that women's occupations are at all unusual. Those that might qualify as atypical include a policewoman, a hat store owner, and a writer. Unfortunately the policewoman is portrayed with a dog driving a car, implying both are fantasies (Ginn, The Dog Next Door and Other Stories, 1969, pp. 52-53). The writer is the author of stories in the book and does not figure in a story herself (SF, level 10, 1971, p. 95); and the hat store owner is a character who is pic tured as humorous (Ginn, The Dog Next Door, p. 34). Definitions Active character: one who is en gaged in a mental or physical enterprise during the story. Passive character: one who stands by or looks on while others participate. Main Character: the protagonist in the story. "Neither" was marked for an impersonal poem, nonhuman fantasy, or animal tale. "Boy" and "Girl" Activity: the established stereotype of what a male or female should do. A girl playing baseball and a boy cooking are ex amples of a female in a boy activity and a male in a girl activity. Many activities were characterized as "Neutral" to counter the impulse to "read in" stereotypes. GRAEBNER: A decade of sexism 53</page><page sequence="3">Much of the variety in women's occupations in the new editions appears in the photographs in Scott, Foresman's edition. On the other hand, the biographies used in the same series are exclusively male. Using photographs, one story shows five sculptures being presented to a school: five blacks, five men. A feature on Mount Rushmore follows: four whites, four men. Thumbnail sketches then are given of these "Nine Americans": nine men (SF, level 8, 1971, pp. 50-51, 52-53, 54-64). Unrealistic portrayals of female functions, such as birth, also ap pear in old and new editions. The story of an unexpected arrival of a baby occurs in both (Ginn, We Are Neighbors, 1961, p. 29, and SF, level 6, 1971, "The Story of Little-Big," pp. 5-28). The female encumbered by stereotypical cloth ing appears in both sets of books. Mother wears a skirt camping in 1961 (Ginn, We Are Neighbors, p. 204) and hiking down the Grand Canyon in 1969 (Ginn, The Dog Next Door, p. 235). Women ap pear to be passive characters when they are pictured in stories but have nothing to say, a situa tion that occurs in both versions. Males are rarely if ever pictured prominently but given no dia logue. In "Mr. Joe's Rabbits" (Ginn, We Are Neighbors, 1961, pp. 37-42) and in "Boomerang" (SF, level 7, 1971, pp. 65-74), the silent characters are smiling fe male onlookers. Girls gain interest Some of the girls pictured as leading characters are interesting. In one story in the old books, Jane wins a prize by throwing a ring around the toy duck at the carni val, after her father and brother fail. But she's the only spunky Figure 1 Sex Characteristics in Elementary Readers Over a Decade (100) Percent of total: 0 Children pictured 50 (0) 100 'Main HI characters Passive Active Dependent Independent "Boy" Activities "Girl" Activities i 80.7 74.0 88.1 89.7 MALE FEMALE 'Computed only for stories about males or females.

There are more girls who are in teresting in the new editions, al though they do not appear in great numbers, as the statistics show. The "little sister" in one story helps out her brother. A Spanish speaking girl finds her way home on her own, although she's sup posed to get male help. And Judy, a black girl, befriends a cat against peer group pressure to do otherwise. In very unstereotypical fashion she says her motto is, Tm Judy. . . . You can take me or leave me." (Ginn, How It Is Nowadays, 1969, pp. 108, 79, 170.) Credit also should be given to the animal illustrations and photo graphs in the new editions. The problem of animal sexuality is a complex one. Animals in the read ers are usually anthropomorphic. In order to show an animal as boy, girl, mother, or father, the artist resorts to stereotypical be havior or apparel ? a dress here, an apron there. Admittedly one can't help but enjoy the sheep who carries a purse in her front paw to denote that she's a girl (SF, level 3, 1971, p. 4). But this in cident illustrates how difficult it is to show variety or atypical ani mal characters. For that reason, the asexual, unclothed animals in the new editions are a relief, even though the change doesn't show up in the statistics.4 Stories in both new and old edi tions show men outnumber wom en by a 3:2 margin; in reality females are a majority of 51 per cent.

Of the authors listed in both editions, 77 percent are female (88.9 old; 66 new). The opposite is true of illustrators: of the illustrators listed in both editions, 71 percent are male (64.5 old; 72.2 new). Conclusions The conclusions to this study are clear. Men and boys continue to dominate both illustrations and story texts in the new editions of elementary readers. Boys are shown slightly more often as pas sive and dependent, but girls are shown slightly less often as active and independent, and there is a tendency toward more sex stereo typing of activities in the new books. Casual clothing and fewer aprons appear in the new texts. The major difference between the two versions is that more occupa tions for women appear in the new editions.

Ani mal illustrations are less typed by sex in the more recent books. In other words, the school readers are changing slightly with societal changes, but they still do not approach reality and are in some ways further from it. It is not always desirable to portray life as it really is, but that these books are less than lifelike where women are concerned is unhealthy. There are some who believe that boys' stories must outnumber girls' because boys won't read stories about females. Perhaps this and many other recent studies on sexism in school books5 may show that the reason boys don't read girls' stories is that girl char acters are consistently dull ? not simply because the stories are about girls. Equally important as the values assigned to girls in these readers are those assigned to boys. Perhaps males do not want or should not have the steady diet of attributes they dis play in these books. As one male columnist states, "I discovered, at a relatively early age, that I was not a prince. ... It is nice for boys to know that it is possible to be a sea captain, a sheepherder or a sheriff, but what is he to think when he takes an office or factory job, rents an apartment and enters battle with urban dirt and cockroaches. . . .

GRAEBNER: ? decade of sexism 57</page><page sequence="7">3In Buford Stefnre's study, "Run, Mama, Run : Women Workers in Ele mentary Readers" (Vocational Gui dance Quarterly, December 1969, pp. 99-102), he classified each woman in the texts by occupation and com pared them to the women described as a whole. He compared these per centages with the figures for Ameri can society in 1969. Women were employed an average of 19 percent of the time in the six series he stud ied (including the old Ginn and SF) compared to the U.S. average of 40 percent of adult women employed (p. 100). Some discrepancy here may be attributed to the preponderance of home settings in children's stories and the number of women with small children (who work less often than the average). Almost 90 percent of the men were identified with jobs in these readers. Steiflre also found that of the women who worked, the per centage of women holding jobs at the professional level was four times greater in the readers than in reality. Women working at factory type jobs and at clerical and sales jobs were shown seven times and three times less than in reality (p. 101). A com parative study of new editions to Stefflre's conclusions would be of merit. 4Good examples of the "new" ani mal are the ten little bears (SF, level 2) and the three pigs (SF, level 3). 5The most complete study to date was conducted at about the same time as this one. A Central New Jer sey section of the National Organiza tion for Women, Women on Words and Images, studied 134 elementary school readers (15 publishers, not including the 1969 Ginn) in Dick &amp; Jane as Victims: Sex Stereotyping in Children s Readers (Princeton, 1972). A bibliography on studies of sexism in schools is available in Mary Ritch ie Key's article, 'The Role of Male and Female in Children's Books?Dis pelling All Doubt," Wilson Library Bulletin, October 1971, pp. 167-76. Slightly more up to date is the biblio graphy being distributed by Feminists on Children's Media, P.O. Box 4315, Grand Central Station, New York, New York 10017. They also publish "Little Miss Muffet Fights Back," recommended nonsexist books about girls for young readers. Although there has been a flood of these stud ies in the past two years, as far back as 1946 Irwin L. Child et al in "Chil dren's Textbooks and Personality Development" (Psychological Mono graphs. LX, iii 1946, 54) concluded that "the female characters do simply tend to be neglected." 6Thomas Hine, "Education and You," Philadelphia Inquirer, Febru ary 6, 1972.
