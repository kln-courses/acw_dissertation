The small and little-known site of Bolonkin is located to the northwest of Chilon, in Chiapas, Mexico. This heavily looted site is composed of at least two mounds surrounding raised terraces. Pierre Becquelin visited it in 1977 during his survey of the Chilon-Bachajon region, in the wake of the Tonina project (Becquelin andBaudez 1982:595). He reported noting some Late Preclassic as well as some Early Postclassic sherds, and published a sketch map (Fig. 1). Standing architecture at the site indicates a Late Classic occupation (Bassie Sweet et al. 2011), but Bolonkin has never been excavated and very little is known about its occupation, or political importance, during that period. This important aspect would help to understand its relation to, and the extent of, the Tonina polity, whose western limit remains unknown (Taladoire 2011). The discov ery of mural paintings in a substructure of the main pyramidal structure provides more information about the possible re gional importance of this site. In April 2003, during a casual visit for the Mayan Esteem Project, Robert Tamba and Chloe Andrieu found a 2-metre deep looters' pit at the top of the main pyramidal structure that uncovered a sandstone stela, found face-down and partially Fig. 1. Bolonkin, sketch plan (adapted from Becquelin and concealed by construction debris. In front of this stela, the Baudez 1981: 595) looters had opened a perpendicular trench into a room (des ignated Room 1) of a substructure of the same pyramidal structure. .

The first is the presence of the quadrilobular form of the K'lN logogram and the four circles that are set in each of the lobes. Palaeographic analyses of this particular variant of the logogram have found that it can be dated to between A.D. 320 and 677 (Lacadena 1995: 298; Helmke andNielsen 2011). The T-shaped form of the counter weight of the earspool assemblage, which resembles the syllabogram la, also sheds light on the dating of the murals. Later examples of this syllabogram render it as in a circular outline, but here the more archaic form is retained. T-shaped la syllabograms are found in securely dated texts between A. D. 378 and 652 (Helmke and Nielsen 2011). The other notable palaeographic feature is the absence of a U-shaped element that is otherwise commonly present in writing and imagery of the Early Classic. Had this element been represented in the murals of Bolonkin, one would expect to find it as the central element of the earspools, but here it is already supplanted by a circular element. According to the palaeographic analyses of Alfonso Lacadena (1995: 209-219), this U-shaped element falls out of the scribal inventory between A.D. 554 and 692. The earlier date of this range provides a lower-end threshold, or post quem date for the murals. The final three features are the presence of circular nose beads, the form of the AK'AB sign and the curved vegetal element that are characteristically early and do not as yet confonn to pure Late Classic examples. The vegetal element is intriguing since it matches, among other examples, those found on Manik ceramics from Tikal (Culbert 1993: Fig. 31 a) and T eotihuacan (T aube 2003:290-291, Figs. 11.1 Oe-g). However, these three features appear to be deliber ate archaisms. Cumulatively, given the dates for the various features found in the panels, A.D. 554 to 652 is the narrowest possible stylistic date to which we can assign the Bolonkin murals. This is to say that the murals of Bolonkin appear to have been executed during the early facet of the Late C lassic (corresponding to the Ik ceramic complex at Tikal, or the Otolum complex at Palenque). We hope that further analyses of the murals and excavations at the site can corroborate this preliminary dating. No ceramic sherds were found during the site's more recent prospection that could have helped to specify the dating of the paintings. However, most of the visible architecture ofthe site appears to be Late Classic. Other hints of a Late Classic occupation at Bolonkin come from looted artefacts. The Mayan Esteem Project registered in a private collection at Chilón, a brown sandstone monument from Bolonkin, measuring ap proximately 125 cm x 50 cm that could be Late Classic in attribution (Mayan Esteem Report 2001). Shesefia and Lee (2004) also report the existence of three yokes, in a private collection, which are said to have a Bolonkin provenance. One of them bore shell glyphs inlays for which they provided tentative readings. Based on the extant glyphs it is clear that the glyphic text recorded a dedication and attributed the ownership of the yoke to an ajk'uhuun (lit. 'worshipper'; see Zender 2004) of Tonina's ruler K'inich Baaknal Chahk (A.D. 688-715) (see Martin and Grube 2000: 181-184). Whereas it remains unclear who this ajk'uhuun was, it might have made reference to K'el Ne Hix, who assisted K' inich Baaknal Chahk in a raid against Palenque in A.D. 771, which culminated in the capture of Palenque's king, K'an Joy Chitam (see Stuart 2003). While tentative, this may well sug gest that the site of Bolonkin was under the control of Tonina at that time, but this would need further investigation to be confirmed.
