<plain_text><page sequence="1">of adolescence: was the adolescence of the late nineteenth century simply the youth culture of the seventeenth re-stated? The changes in children's economic roles wrought by industrialization are fully considered, but other aspects of socialization are relatively neglected. The rise of formal schooling is one of the most striking and least well understood phenomena of the same period. In launching his discussion of the nineteenth-century 'child-saving' move- ments, Professor Cunningham claims significant autonomy for the romantic view of the child, 'a concern to save children for the enjoyment of childhood', and again in his conclusion refers to its 'remarkable tenacity' in western societies. Yet much of the intervening discussion suggests the use of such ideas for propaganda and cosmetic purposes by those pursuing more long- standing and familiar agendas from soul saving to state building. Finally, Professor Cunningham airs the idea that in the late twentieth century the distinctiveness and separateness of children and of childhood is diminishing, while yet the period of the child's economic dependence on the parent con- tinues to lengthen. It would have been good to have both of these discussions developed much more fully. They will generate lively debate among those already decently well-read in the field. But the students for whom the book is intended may come away somewhat bemused. Newnham College, Cambridge GILLIAN SUTHERLAND Brian Bond's The Pursuit of Victory. From Napoleon to Saddam Hussein (Oxford: U.P., I996; pp. ix + 240. ?I7.99) addresses an important question, of which modern societies have become increasingly conscious and by which they appear to be ever more baffled: what is the meaning of military victory, how is it achieved, and how is it translated into endurable political gains? Professor Bond approaches this question by reviewing the history of great power wars from the eighteenth century to the present, with their many abortive victories and paradoxical results. Drawing on existing historical scholarship, he offers a sensible and readable summary of this history, covering on the whole a well-trodden ground and familiar themes, including: 'Frederick the Great and the Era of Limited War', 'Napoleon and the Decisive Battle', 'The Influence of Jomini and Clausewitz', 'Moltke and the Wars of German Unification', 'The Schlieffen Era', the World Wars, and the nuclear age. Perhaps in a book of such nature the author would have been better advised to cut some of the military narrative of wars and campaigns and devote more to analysis. He reviews the political and diplomatic factor, rightly pointing out, for example, that it was Napoleon's unlimited drive for European hegemony and Bismarck's restraint and isolation of his enemies that led to the former's ultimate defeat and the latter's success. However, the profound economic, social and intellectual changes that have transformed the West, and the world, in the period concerned (and whose bearing on the question tackled by the book seems self-evident), are not accorded the attention they deserve. Moreover, one may ask if the 'problem of victory' is new in human his- tory, and in what way. The book might have benefited from a longer time span, covering the pre-modern as well as the modern world, and thus placing the developments of the past centuries in a better perspective. As one example of the wider questions and observations that might have suggested themselves: EHR Feb. 98 I998 263 SHORTER NOTICES</page><page sequence="2">in a period that has been characterized by the spread of nationalism, by indus- trialization, and by a growing world economy is it the case that the wars which have ended with endurable changes to the international arena have almost solely been those fought for self-determination and independence? Tel Aviv University AZAR GAT Two gems culled from The Good Reviewer's Guide to the Universe: 'what audience is the book aimed at?'; 'what are the basic assumptions of the writer(s)?' Modern Times. Reflections on a Century of English Modernity, ed. Mica Nava and Alan O'Shea (London: Routledge, 1996; pp. 272. ?45; pb. ?14.99), is intended for those 'studying and teaching in the fields of cultural history and cultural theory'. The assumptions are that theories are realities, not merely tools of analysis, that 'modernity' has an actual, indisputable, existence, and that a secure framework for studying 'cultural history' (in the limited and highly technical sense in which that phrase is used here) is provided by certain privileged texts, the products of such authors as Walter Benjamin, Theodor Adorno and Marshall Berman. As early as page 17 we learn that 'one of the features of modernity has been its global aspiration', and, as late as page 200, that after adopting a more generous spirit towards race relations in the g 5os, 'modernity took to the streets once more'. This is not merely 'nat- uralization' (as people who write this sort of stuff like to say of the behaviour of those they oppose), it is good old-fashioned anthropomorphism. One at least of the editors may wish to challenge me on this. Nava's own chapter, 'Modernity's Disavowal: Women, the City and the Department Store' sounds about as anthropomorphic as they come, but then on the second page of this chapter (p. 39), we are casually informed that 'modernity of course is a constructed narrative'. But 'narrative' as used in this kind of discourse is always represented as having materiality. Who, or what, is the subject of that glibly over-used verb, 'to construct', is never made very clear, though if one steeps oneself in the theory, it begins to emerge that whatever 'constructing' is being done is being done by wicked old bourgeois society. This book, then, is not written in accordance with the principles which underlie articles published in The English Historical Review. That made clear - and it must be made clear because there is so much obfuscating waffle about the need for interdisciplinarity and an end to over-specialization (let me never fly in a jet which has not been built by specialists) - I heartily commend this book to all historians. The metaphysical tradition in which it is securely placed has always depended upon rhetorical brilliance rather than the citation of evidence, so that everything in Modern Times, even when utterly unconvincing, is at least a joy to read. And even if 'modernity' doesn't actually exist, it really is quite exciting to have fine minds grappling with what it might be. Two chapters particularly caught my imagination. The first is Sally Alexander on 'The Mysteries and Secrets of Women's Bodies: Sexual Knowledge in the First Half of the Twentieth Century'. Using autobiographies, a certain amount of oral testimony and the famous collection of letters addressed to Marie Stopes, edited by Ruth Hall, the author presents an appalling picture of sexual ignorance and fear among young women in the 1920S and I930S. This, if I have understood aright, was 'pre-modern', sexual knowledge becoming 'modern' when it was 'embodied EHR Feb. 98 264 February SHORTER NOTICES</page></plain_text>
