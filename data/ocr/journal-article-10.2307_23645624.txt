<plain_text><page sequence="1">COPPER PIGMENT-MAKING IN THE ATACAMA DESERT (NORTHERN CHILE) Marcela Sepúlveda R., Valentina Figueroa L., and Sandrine Pagés-Camagna Results of physico-chemical analysis of samples of rock paintings and blue and green pigments from the Atacama Desert (northern Chile) allow us to incorporate a new technology, pigment production, to processes of mining and copper pro duction, which until now have been related only to lapidary and metal working. Archaeological contexts associated with paints and pigments, as well as information available from historical times, allow us to suggest hypotheses about their importance in sharing networks of late prehispanic times (A.D. 900-1550) and after Spanish contact. In these times, the production and circulation of pigments would have closely connected the Upper Loa region to the Lipez region in south western Bolivia and other regions of the Atacama Desert. Los resultados de análisis físico-químicos de muestras de pinturas rupestres y pigmentos azules y verdes del desierto de Ata cama (norte de Chile) nos permiten incorporar una nueva tecnología, la producción de pigmento, a la minería y proceso de producción del cobre relacionada, hasta ahora, solamente con la lapidaria y la metalurgia. Los contextos arqueológicos aso ciados a las pinturas y los pigmentos, así como información disponible para tiempos históricos, nos permiten sugerir hipóte sis sobre su importancia en las redes de intercambio de tiemposprehispánicos tardíos (900-1550d.C.)y post-contacto hispano. En estos tiempos, la producción y circulación de pigmentos habrían conectado estrechamente la región del Loa Superior con la región de Lípez en el sudoeste de Bolivia y otras regiones del Desierto de Atacama.

The vibrations around 815,906, and 970 cm"1 correspond to the hydroxy 1 group and at 672 cm" ', with the FI20 group. Stretching vibrations5 of the hydroxyl group are around 3480 and 3580; additional bands around 3380 and 3480 are attrib utable to water OH-stretching. The Cu-Cl stretch ing vibration is around 510 cm"1. On eriochalcite, the strongest bands are observed at 405 and 215 cm"1, assigned to Cu-Cl stretching and Cl-Cu-Cl bending modes,6 with water units at 1620 and 3365 cm"1. The most important band for atacamite is around 511 cm"1, with three others around 974, 912, and 819 cm"1. For clinoatacamite, hydroxyl deformation modes are observed at 969,927,892, 866, and 799 cm"1, and strongbands at 367,420, and 445 cm"1 (Frost 2003). The SO symmetric stretch ing vibration is at 974, with overlapping bands at 911 and 982 cm'1 for langite. Gypsum is characterized by vibrations at 415, 490, 621, 670, 1010, 1135, and 3408 cm1. Gyp sum is found only on the paint samples, so it is a secondary mineral. The Atacama Desert has a wide variety of sources of copper mineral ore. The bandy lite (paint from Confluencia site) and eriochalcite (paint form Santa Bárbara) are two minerals found only in Toki copper deposits of the Quetena mines (Calama, Antofagasta region, El Loa province). Bandylite occurs in Calama with antofagastite and atacamite as a crust on rock joints (Palache and Foshag 1938). Chrysocolla (raw fragments from Incahuasi site) exists also in many mines of Calama and especially in Quetena mines (Antofagasta region, El Loa province). Malachite is identified in Quetena deposits or Chuquicamata mines. Chrysocolla is rare in the southeastern section of the deposit, confined to the "low acid" areas (Bandy 1938). Clinoatacamite is localized in Chuquicamata mines, 15km north of Calama. Ata camite, bandylite, and eriochalcite all seem to be extracted from Quetena mines. These sources of raw mineral ores could most easily have been exploited in prehispanic times. According to the initial results from the rock art painting samples, the mixtures are based on cop per ore that clearly originated in the same region, where it is abundant. Chlorides, however, are abun dant in the region, so it is difficult to distinguish among their sources. Sulfates could come from mineral deposits in the region, but we cannot for get the presence in samples from rock art paintings of gypsum (Table 1), which is commonly found as a translucent surface patina. Most interesting is the heterogeneity of compounds, selected for their color, as demonstrated in the results of the Inc ahuasi samples, green for the atacamite, and blue for the clinoatacamite (Figures 6 and 7; Table 2).</page><page sequence="8">474 LATIN AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 24, No. 4, 2013] 3 £ .T1 ^ 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 3000 3500 Wavenumber (cm-1) Figure 6.

Continued research will increase our understand ing of how pigment-making technology fit into interactions that occurred in the Atacama Desert's ancient past. Acknowledgments.

Now conserved in the American Museum of Natural History, New York, 2. Samples were analyzed at Centre de Recherche et de Restauration des Musées de France laboratory (C2RMF) in Paris. 3. The size is relative. The grain size refers to the large size of the grains that make up the mixture compared to other samples analyzed, in which the different elements measured less than 10 /&lt;m. 4. All samples were observed under ultraviolet light dur ing microscopic observation. 5. Stretching band indicates that the energy level refers to a normal mode of vibration. 6. Bending modes refer to one of the peculiar modes of vibration between bonded atoms. 7. Today these objects are conserved in the Museo de Iquique.
