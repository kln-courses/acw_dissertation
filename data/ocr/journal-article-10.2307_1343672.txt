<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Security of the Obvious: On John Cage's Musical Radicalism Daniel A. Herwitz In those rare cases when a composer, such as John Cage in his more extreme moments,... allow[s] music to unfold in time totally without restriction, the results seem peculiarly "unmusical." Indeed, in Cage's most consequential experiments in this direction, a performer is simply provided with a unit of time within which anything-or nothing-can be done: musical time then becomes indistinguishable from ordinary time. But if that is so, in what sense can this time be said to be musical at all? -ROBERT P. MORGAN, "Musical Time/Musical Space" There is no doubt that John Cage is one of the most important figures in twentieth-century music. His intelligence, humanity, and above all his compositional inventiveness have made him perhaps the most influential and eloquent spokesperson for the musical avant-garde. As a writer and maker of sounds, he has in many ways defined the musical avant-garde. His contributions to music have included the vast extension of percussive means (most notably the invention of the prepared piano as we know it today), the development of new rhythmic configurations in composition, the early use of electronically processed sounds, and the early use of Much of this paper has been inspired by countless conversations with my teacher, also friend, Ted Cohen. I have also benefited from discussions with others-teachers or friends- especially Stephen Toulmin, Robert Morgan, and Nancy Burke.

He has reworked the Dadaist event into an occasion specifically for and about music, which produced the musical happening. In an age when many composers write music as if they are about to die-even if they are under the age of twenty-five-Cage's music is warm and wonderful. His writings combine everything from technical discussions of electronic instruments to disquisitions on Arnold Schonberg and Erik Satie, Indian philosophy, mushrooms, abstract paint- ers, Zen monks, and Southern California. They are incisive, devastating, and charming. Yet if Cage is one of the most important figures in twentieth-century music, he is also one of the least understood and perhaps one of the hardest to understand. He means for his work to be easy but it is in fact as difficult as that of his teacher and friend, Marcel Duchamp. Part of its difficulty lies in its complexity. Cage is at once musician, destroyer of music, rhetorician, theorist, and mystic. He is a man of many voices, some of which are radical while others are not. Sometimes he is set to revamp everything we think of as music while other times he confines his attack to the high modernism of Schonberg and Anton von Webern. Sometimes he seems to be saying utterly ordinary things while other times his voice is as mysterious and incomprehensible as that of a Zen master. These voices both-coagulate and contradict, leaving one unsure as to what one is hearing and thus how one should respond. Furthermore, Cage isn't simply a man of many selves; he specifically intends to conflate and confuse. Like his modernist compatriot Duchamp, he aims to speak in a plethora of voices so as to produce in us, his audience, an overall response that fails to cohere in ways that we want, thus throwing into relief or undercutting some pattern of our ordinary beliefs and responses to works of art. That Cage's challenge to our musical beliefs, attitudes, and practices is posed from the difficult perspective of a Zen master has often been discussed. What has been neglected both by Cage himself and by others is another equally potent challenge to the ordinary which Cage formulates in a related but distinct voice: that of the philosopher. Through his relentless inquiry into new music, Cage has defined certain radical pos- sibilities for musical change. What is in effect his skepticism about music as we know it contains a cogent analysis of our musical concepts and practices: of what it is for us ordinarily to believe that something is music as opposed to not music, and of how those beliefs about music connect with styles of feeling and treating what we hear when we hear it as music. Indeed it is Cage's genius to have established the topic of skepticism Daniel A. Herwitz is an assistant professor of philosophy at California State University, Los Angeles. He is currently at work on a book exploring philosophical tendencies in twentieth-century music, art, and architecture.</page><page sequence="3">786 Daniel A. Herwitz The Security of the Obvious about music as an issue for philosophy and cultural criticism. Cage's radical perspective on our musical beliefs allows us to consider both what those beliefs are and whether and how they might be justified. This invitation to philosophical response is an important feature of the avant- garde which Cage shares with Duchamp in plastic art, Gordon Matta- Clarke in architecture, and others. I wish to give it its due by outlining and addressing Cage's skepticism about music. 1 Cage's challenge is addressed to the very core of our concepts of music, namely to our commitment to the idea of drawing distinctions between musical and nonmusical sound concatenations, distinctions rooted in our most basic styles of hearing. Distinctions we draw between music and nonmusic may be less than precise, but they lie so much at the foundation of our musical practices that it strikes us as bizarre that someone might care to challenge them. Given reasonably normal listening conditions, reasonably normal listeners, and reasonably nondefective performances, it is our cultural tendency to believe that everything from "Three Blind Mice" to "I Want to Hold Your Hand" to the "Finale" of Swan Lake can be heard as music, whereas the sounds of airplanes taking off from runways or the scraping of plastic forks in certain fast-food restaurants, however intriguing and revelatory of the contemporary world, are not in any ordinary sense music.' Many such concatenations of sound which we do not in any straightforward sense call "music" we acknowledge to have their musical aspects, from the sounds of birds and the howling of the wind on late October nights to the sounds of rush-hour New York when, for example, the wailing of a passing train syncronizes with the soft murmuring of pedestrians highlighted by a blurring of motorcycles to strange effect. However, the kind of criteria we rely on in deciding not to call these various sound concatenations "music" is that either they lack the kind of overall coherence, development, closure, and elabora- tion characteristic of works of music or they lack the element of human intention-the compositional hand-that distinguishes art from nature or from the purely fortuitous. Cage impugns with gentle audacity our commitments to such criteria and to such distinctions, saying to those of us who take it as obvious that the sounds of elevators, however pleasing or profound, fail to constitute music: 1. See Ted Cohen, "A Critique of the Institutional Theory of Art: The Possibility of Art," in Aesthetics: A Critical Anthology, ed. George Dickie and R. J. Sclafani (New York, 1977), pp. 183-95.</page><page sequence="4">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 787 For instance, people getting in and out of elevators and the elevators moving from one floor to another: this "information" can activate circuits that bring to our ears a concatenation of sounds (music). Perhaps you wouldn't agree that what you heard was music. But in that case another transformation had intervened: what you heard had set your mind to repeating the definitions of art and music found in out-of-date dictionaries.2 Cage might appear to be saying merely that old fogies should open up their ears so that a world of contemporary sounds can strike them with interest-a kind of irresistible plea for openness in hearing. However, he is emphatically stating something much stronger. He is saying that any concatenation of sounds is music, already dispensing both with the musical criterion of compositionality (elevator sounds are not composed, they simply happen to happen), and with our ordinary notions of musical form-of coherence, closure, development, and the like. Indeed Cage goes further. His is really the claim that it is the mediation of dictionaries per se that we should do without, and by dictionaries he does not have in mind merely the kind of excessively rigid musical categories one found in post-Webern libraries of the 1940s and 1950s. We do not need a more up-to-date, more relaxed and fluid (call it postmodern) dictionary; we need to do away with dictionaries entirely. We need neither a new language for talking about music, nor a new set of distinctions between what is and what is not music, nor a new set of criteria for drawing such distinctions. What we must learn to do is to approach sound concatenations in ways unmediated by anything like our criteria or concepts.3 This is Cage in his radical as opposed to his more moderate voice. Cage believes that when we approach sound with ears informed by our concepts we are precluding a deep and immediate acknowledgment of both sound and the world, opting instead for a kind of distorted attempt at control. Indeed he believes that the very attempt to order sound in the mind's ear as coherent, complete, resolving, elaborative, formal is an act of manipulation or possession. In projecting through the ear our criteria of the musical, we are doing to sound what we do to other people when we try to remake them in our own images as opposed to letting them freely be themselves. To acknowledge sound, like acknowledging people, is for Cage to just let it be. Such a view goes beyond any mere plea for tolerance in music (or in ethics) for it identifies 2.

I should remark that I am reconstructing Cage's position on the basis of his writings and performances, and that the position I ascribe to him is asserted nowhere in a totally direct way. I will try to quote passages which make the reconstruction plausible.</page><page sequence="5">788 Daniel A. Herwitz The Security of the Obvious respect with noninterference. So long as we don't interfere, sound and life are fine. Cage says: This play [music], however, is an affirmation of life-not an attempt to bring order out of chaos nor to suggest improvements in creation, but simply to wake up to the very life we're living, which is so excellent once one gets one's mind and one's desires out of its way and lets it act of its own accord.4 Why the mere act of organizing sound, or the mere interference with life, constitute acts of distortion-much less how one is supposed to get one's mind and desires out of the way and why life is so excellent when one does-these are things to be explained. The rosiness of such remarks might appear outrageous in the light of everything we know of the terrors of music, much less of life, in our painful twentieth century. But Cage means his remarks to be serious just as he means for them to be outrageous, because for Cage the liberation from one's mind and desires is the invocation of an attitude toward sound and the world in which the discovery of the world's beauty is revealed. Cage states, "To accept whatever comes, re- gardless of the consequences, is to be unafraid or to be full of that love which comes from a sense of at-oneness with whatever."5 Cage is not unlike St. Francis of Assisi, for whom the entire natural world is an occasion for interest, profundity, and gentleness. Such "at-oneness" is marked by the sense that nothing about any particular thing will cause us to treat it differently from any other thing. Each piece of the acoustical world is then equally an occasion for immersion, and equally a piece of the rest of the world. Music is at peace with life, and one is free to feel that at every moment the entire world resonates with the same capac- ities-as if the world were but one enormous chord or family. Projecting our musical categories onto sound inherently spells out differences in how we treat sounds (just as projecting our beliefs, attitudes, and expectations onto people inherently involves treating some people differently from others). When, for example, we projectively hear through a sound concatenation in such a way that we end up describing it as a performance of a work by Beethoven, we are identifying that sound concatenation in a way that makes it matter differently to us than noise, bird calls, or silence matter to us (however wonderful these might be in their ways). Cage believes that because our projective identifications of sounds involve us in such evaluative differentiations between sounds, they should be castigated. For Cage all there is to identify in sound is whatever makes us treat it no differently from any other sound. That can only be sound apart 4.

Cage, "Juilliard Lecture," A Year From Monday, p. 105.</page><page sequence="6">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 789 from our entire mode of projection, identification, and treatment of it-call it a thing in itself, a thing divorced from mind, desires, dictionaries, and whatever else distorts the issue of at-oneness. This idea that sound is a thing identifiable independently from our projective ears, a thing which is miraculously acknowledgeable through the state of at-oneness, brands Cage's claim as skeptical about our projective modes of knowing music. To twist Kant, Cage's skepticism is about whether the world of sound conforms to our projection of it. The first question to be raised by this invitation to philosophy concerns what he construes our modes of projection onto sound (our conception) to consist in. This he encapsulates in his slogan that sounds are sounds and not people. He says in his famous Juilliard lecture that before studying music, men are men and sounds are sounds. While studying music things aren't clear. After studying music men are men and sounds are sounds. That is to say: at the beginning, one can hear a sound and tell immediately that it isn't a human being or something to look at.... While studying music things get a little confused. Sounds are no longer just sounds, but are letters.... Sharps and flats.... The privileged tones that remain are arranged in modes or scales or nowadays [twelve tone] rows, and an abstract process begins called composition. That is, a composer uses the sounds to express an idea or a feeling or an integration of these. In the case of a musical idea, one is told that the sounds themselves are no longer of consequence; what 'count' are their re-lation- ships.... In the case of a musical feeling, a-gain the sounds are unimportant, what counts is expression. ... If anyone wants to get a feeling of how emotional a composer proved himself to be, he has to ... imagine that sounds are not sounds at all but are Bee- thoven.6 We pass beyond treating sounds as themselves both when we project formal or structural relationships onto them and when we hear them as expressive of human emotions. When we hear ninth chords as part of a tonal system resonating with the dying, unresolved weariness of the late Romantics (who were especially fond of such chords) or with the offbeat whimsy of Thelonious Monk (who is also fond of them), we are hearing more in them than is there and than we ought to. It is this projection of structure and expression into our hearing that Cage rightly has understood to underlie our distinctions between what is and is not music. When we hear sounds we listen for structure and emotionality in the sounds, and it is in virtue of what we hear or fail to hear in sounds, along with what we know of their origins as composed 6.

I have not reproduced that graphic presentation here, which I think does not seriously affect the understanding of his ideas.</page><page sequence="7">790 Daniel A. Herwitz The Security of the Obvious or natural, that we decide to call individual sound concatenations "mu- sic" or not. Even if we do not fully conflate music and people (unlike the often-mentioned yokel who actually tries to cheer the music up), it is not so clear where our mode of feeling ends and the music begins. It is this practice of projecting something into sound that for Cage is an act of failing to respect the thing itself. To glean the radical power of Cage's pronouncements it is worth pointing out how deep such acts of projective hearing lie in our practices, how natural it is for us to associate sounds and people.7 We respond to musical structure as expressive, hearing melodies as whimsical or sad, chord patterns as anguished and counterpoint as intensely driven. Whatever analysis best fits the description, we do find it irresistible to say that the sadness is "in" the music like it is in people. We describe the kinds of affective states music causes in us using language originally employed to describe causal relations between persons. The music "calms" us (Brahms' lulling melodies), it "seduces" us (Wagner or, even more, Mozart), it "forcefully energizes" us (Schumann). The point is not merely that music makes us think and feel in the ways people can make us think and feel (drugs and alchohol can also do that), but that the music causes our affective and conceptual states by generating in us the attitude that it is like a person in doing what it is doing to us. We see the music as gesturing to us like people gesture to us, as speaking to us like they speak to us, and generally as doing things to or for us like people do-whether good, pleasant, and wonderful or irritating, irresponsible, and bad. Brahms' melodies calm us down through our sense that they gesture gently and sweetly like a mother or friend. Mozart's famous aria "Batti, batti, o bel Masetto, la tua povera Zerlina," sung by Zerlina to disarm Masetto in the first act of Don Giovanni, cannot but melt all listeners with its softly pulsing and caressing cellos, reinforcing a perfectly proportioned melodic line that falls accented on the word "bel" ("lovely"). It seduces us as much by its causing us to see it as charming, warm, and softly stirring as it causes us to see it as charming through its already operative powers of sweet seduction. For many, the music of Wagner by contrast is perceived as a bombastic and grandiose attempt at seductive manipulation--like the kind of person whose advances they would be angered by and refuse. Related to our perception of music as gestural is our sense of it as resembling human action or human activity. We employ a great variety of action descriptions in speaking about music. Themes return "effortlessly" or "heroically," or fade into "sleep." Musical counterpoint is "dialogue." Modulations "establish" new keys and musical lines move "up" and "down." The very place where all this happens is a kind of musical "space"-not 7. Ted Cohen helped me to glean the important associations between works of art and persons for our acts of construing things as works of art. For a discussion specifically directed to how expression in music is related to expression by people, I have been stimulated by Peter Kivy's The Corded Shell: Reflections on Musical Expression (Princeton, N.J., 1980).</page><page sequence="8">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 791 merely the complex theoretical construct of Heinrich Schenker and other theorists but also the ordinary pretheoretical place where listeners see sounds as happening.8 Hence the very projection of simple formal and structural qualities into sound concatenations is closely allied with our seeing such sounds as persons, since the projection of form and structure involves the projection of a space in which music is seen to unfold and act. And onto whole musical "movements" or works we impute larger forms of activity. Paradigmatically, Beethoven is heard as setting forth musical goals, modifying these in the course of complex musical elabo- rations, and finally achieving closure in a compressed and forthright manner. Even works such as late Schubert songs in which chromatic and rhythmic disjunctions can fail to fully resolve are heard as being like actions -incomplete and inconclusive journeys or acts of gradual dis- appearance. Furthermore, compositionality is a mark of the musical because we construe music to be a piece of communication between composer and audience. We do not treat music merely as like persons and actions; we treat it as intended by the compositional hand to communicate and invoke that content. The composer is taken to intend that we treat the work as the product of his or her intention.9 Music is not merely heard as like persons and actions, it is heard as a human product-as the product of a hand committed to what it has wrought.'0 8. In thinking about the importance of a concept of musical space, I have relied on the work of Robert Morgan, whose quotation begins this essay. See Morgan, "Musical Time/ Musical Space," Critical Inquiry 6 (Spring 1980): 527-38, especially the opening sections. 9. See H. P. Grice's account of "meaning" in terms of the notion of reflexive intention in his essay, "Utterer's Meaning, Sentence-Meaning, and Word-Meaning," in The Philosophy of Language, ed. J. R. Searle (Oxford, 1971), pp. 54-70. 10. While the issue of the identity of music, specifically of how anthropomorphic in quality music is, has represented an ongoing debate since the late eighteenth century, even formalism has viewed music as inherently symbolic of people. The debate has been about the way in which best to construe this symbolic capacity of music. Like Cage, formalists from Eduard Hanslick to Leonard Meyer have declared that most of what we ordinarily think of as the expression of emotion in music is not part of the music itself. Formalism's restricted conception of what the music itself is is defended on the basis of a theory of beauty which identifies uniquely musical beauty with the disinterested contemplation of musical form. But according to formalism, form consists in structural relationships between sounds (harmonic, contrapuntal, elaborative, and so on), and musical structure matters to us by virtue of its symbolic likeness to persons. To focus on the free play of formal ideas in sound is to acknowledge symbolically a specific and essential human capacity: the productive faculty of human imagination (call it genius). The idea, a Kantian protoromantic idea, is that such a capacity lies concealed by ordinary life, and thus needs a symbolic entity-call it an art form-in which we can recognize it and take delight in it. Since that capacity is for Kant essential to our moral and rational nature, taking delight in its representation is our way of taking delight in ourselves. Indeed, the formalist's reason for resisting our ordinary notion that expression is part of the music is that, for him or her, to project ordinary expression onto music is simply to conceal that symbolic representation yet once again. Hence formalism is argued for on the basis of what people are like. See Eduard</page><page sequence="9">792 Daniel A. Herwitz The Security of the Obvious Cage is opposed to the hearing of any shred of symbolic content in sound. His radical experiments in musical form in the 1950s can best be understood in terms of his desire to completely pry apart our hearing of sounds from our urge to project structure and people into the sounds. In these experiments Cage uses form as a kind of necessary evil, as a way of simply blocking out a segment of time while trying to impose as little organization on it as possible. He structures the time segment alea- torically (using chance methods) or by simply choosing an obviously artificial pattern such as that found in the I Ching as a way of getting started. His performances have gone even further. The most illustrious, 4'33", first performed by David Tudor in Maverick Hall, Woodstock, New York in 1952, consists of four minutes and thirty-three seconds of "silence." The performer sits down at the piano, opens the "tri-partite score," turns its pages, closes it, and-if of a dramatic flair-bows to the audience. Nothing is played by the performer: no harmonies, no "Tristan chord," nothing. The performer goes through the ritual of performing music without performing anything. This founding example of the hap- pening is meant to challenge us to accept it as music. The challenge is ingenious. If there is no sound, how could the issue of whether music has been performed ever arise? But there are sounds there-random sounds of the pages being turned and the audience giggling and the rustling of the trees outside and of birds. Cage intends that we attend to sounds which are not the product of any compositional intention of his and are by extension not conveyed by the performer. His aim is to obliterate his own expected presence in sound. Freed from our fixation on the composer's hand, mind, and desires, we can "wake up" to the "excellence" of that hitherto dormant world of sound which is nothing other than happening to happen. The work is a rhetorical instrument to lead us from the composer's instrumentation to the sounds of the present. And since according to Cage sound is everywhere, this is to lead us from music to the doors of the world. And to the doors of philosophy." 2 4'33", Cage's radical exemplar, occasions philosophy through its in- vitation to hear sounds as liberated from structure and anthropomorphism. As Cage says, "A time that's just time will let sounds be just sounds and if they are folk tunes, unresolved ninth chords, or knives and forks, just Hanslick, The Beautiful in Music, ed. Morriz Weitz, trans. Gustav Cohen (New York, 1957), and Leonard B. Meyer, "Some Remarks on Value and Greatness in Music," in Aesthetics Today, ed. Morris Philipson (Cleveland, 1961), pp. 169-87. 11. In thinking about "musical acts" like speech acts with respect to rhetorical capacities, I have been helped by conversations with Stephen Toulmin.</page><page sequence="10">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 793 folk tunes, unresolved ninth chords, or knives and forks."'2 What is left for us to hear in a ninth chord or a folk tune once we have given up hearing structure or the resonances of persons? Can we hear a ninth chord as a chord without hearing it as part of a structural system called tonality or perhaps some other system in some other context? It seems easier to imagine this when one imagines simply hearing the chord by itself and harder when one imagines hearing it as part of some clearly tonal or other work. Can we hear a folk tune without imagining hearing in it some sort of human statement or feeling? What then does it mean to call these sounds "ninth chord" or "folk tune"? What is a folk tune after all but some concatenation of sounds conceptualized as that human sort of thing produced in a certain sort of community by a certain sort of person in a certain sort of style? The very use of language scrapes here. The terms "ninth chord" and "folk tune" are reduced to simple indexical markers by Cagian nonconceptualizing ears-indices marking that and that where what that is is what our ears tell us, and our ears are supposed to impute no ordinary structure to either of these things. Cage's invitation is, as I have said, for us to hear sounds as what Kant would call things in themselves, things apart from any projections of our categories-here our modes of imputing to sounds structure and an- thropomorphism. Cage wants to abolish all dictionaries because he wants to abolish all modes of mediation between us and sound, as if sound is there for us to hear coherently apart from our projections of structure and the rest onto it. Cage's is a transcendental claim: we can relate to sound in itself. As such it invites a Kantian kind of question about whether sound is coherently available to us apart from our ear's projective schemes. Put another way, Cage is skeptical about the necessity of our hearing sounds in a structured (mediated) way, and since our concepts of music depend on such styles of hearing, his is skepticism about our ways of con- ceptualizing music, of knowing what music is. His challenge is addressed to the security of what we take as obvious-our musical practices. This skepticism about the necessity of conceptualizing sound is ultimately motivated by a kind of moral argument about its desirability to the effect that the urge to hear structure in sound is a fixation we will be a lot happier without. But since ought implies can, if we cannot do without conceptualization, if we find in our ears no possibility of hearing sound in an unmediated way, then there is no issue for us about whether we would be happier otherwise. Cage is to my knowledge the first to have in effect occasioned such a Kantian, skeptical question in the sphere of music. And he has done so in a way that makes the question one of direct cultural relevance for contemporary music. That in itself seems to me to represent a philosophical contribution. Nor ought one write it off as hopelessly trivial, even if one's 12. Cage, "Erik Satie," Silence: Lectures and Writing (Middletown, Conn., 1961), p. 81.</page><page sequence="11">794 Daniel A. Herwitz The Security of the Obvious initial response is to say that there is of course no such thing as sound for us to hear independently of our modes of projection, and that therefore Cage is crazy and wasting our time. His point is precisely to cause us to explore the power in such remarks, to cause us to doubt their power, and thus to take seriously that we don't know ourselves (our own ears). Such doubts can lead us, if nothing else, to understand how and whether we can prove or otherwise know that we do know ourselves as music makers and listeners. 4'33" is successful in its raising of another, related philosophical question. What Cage has done by that performance is to have succeeded in producing an object about which we cannot simply say, without further explanation, either that it is or that it is not music. ("The Situation must be Yes-and-No not either-or. Avoid a polar situation.")13 Such an object invites skepticism through the sense that it has undercut our concepts of music by dislodging the clearly felt borders between what is and what is not music. It is as if we can no longer tell where music ends and the rest of the world begins, with the result that we no longer know what music is. The importance of borderline or otherwise exceptional cases for testing and revealing our concepts is something philosophers in this century, especially the later Wittgenstein, have focused on. Wittgenstein says in the Philosophical Investigations: A main source of our failure to understand is that we do not command a clear view of the use of our words.-Our grammar is lacking in this sort of perspicuity. A perspicuous representation produces just that understanding which consists in 'seeing connex- ions'. Hence the importance of finding and inventing intermediate cases. 14 Wittgenstein's concern with intermediate cases is related to his anti-es- sentialist themes. He impugns the traditional philosophical search for essences as hopeless, replacing that search with a conception of things as being known and defined by the families of complex, related roles they play in the web of our language games and form of life. Philosophers of art have often stressed this Wittgensteinian perspective in approaching art. They have been captivated by the notion that there exist at most only strands of similarities or family resemblances between the various objects we call works of art. I myself hold such a bias about music. My own view is that there exists no nonnormative, nonquestion-begging way to establish once and for all which features of musical works are essential and which are not. There is no essence to music; rather there are a family of related things we call "music" and a family of related ways of treating 13.

Nor is there any way to settle similarly the question of which objects are music and which are not. Amidst the barrage of purportedly musical objects that have been produced throughout history, across cultures and in this modernist century, listeners whom we trust can and do disagree about whether to consider individual examples "music" or not. For example, the contemporary composer La Monte Young (a former student of Cage) has produced a purportedly musical work consisting of solely one pitch sounded with varying timbre and dynamics. Some will refuse to call it music because they don't believe it can be taken seriously in any way. Others will take it seriously but not as a work of music. These might hear it as a meditative exercise distinct from music. Still others will take it to be music, hearing it as a meditative extension of what music is. All these alternatives are rational. We lack, in my view, a neutral vantage point from which to arbitrate this and other such disputes, since what we rely on in arbitrating are our own norms and preferences, and these can be contested by others. Our obsession with deciding every such case seems to me to represent an inability to acknowledge that what makes something music is nothing other than how people treat it (hear it and react to what they hear), and that no one can expect that his or her own ears-like his or her own self-can be brought into complete harmony with those of others. The recognition that within and between music communities listeners irrevocably diverge in mind and ear can engender the disturbing thought that there is nothing to prevent such unresolvable divergences from extending to the core of music-to the core of what we claim to know and feel music is. It is this thought, the thought that there is nothing solid to our concepts of music, that is occasioned both by Cagian skepticism and by the anti-essentialist position of Wittgenstein. Indeed Michael Dummett and others have ascribed to Wittgenstein a kind of radical conventionalist position tailor-made to substantiate this doubt.'5 On their reading of Wittgenstein our concepts are radically arbitrary in the sense of resting on nothing further than convention (as opposed to nature, necessity, or some other further thing). Since neither nature nor necessity backs up our ears, there is nothing in principle to prevent us from radically disagreeing about the basic facts and criteria of music or of radically altering our concepts-or our mind's ear-if we want to. Cag- ian radicalism is a legitimate possibility to be accepted or refused simply on the basis of its desirability. We can do nothing further to prove or otherwise establish the legitimacy of our styles of hearing and our musical concepts. I bring up Wittgenstein because the more critical, Kantian reading of Wittgenstein that I prefer to Dummett's is of relevance for the diffusing 15.

Herwitz The Security of the Obvious of Cagian skepticism. To see this, a brief Wittgenstein excursus is in order. Wittgenstein says that our concepts and language inextricably depend on what he refers to as our form of life (an elusive but crucial notion), and that our form of life is not merely conventional, thus linking our form of life to what he calls "facts of nature" and these to what he calls our "natural history" (PI, p. 230). Our natural history is not inde- pendent of convention, since everything from our language to our social life is part of that history; yet it also outruns mere convention, involving everything from our biology and psychology to our environment. Our form of life is the web of our attitudes, beliefs, desires, interests, behavior, reactions, and practices. The notion is an organicist one, a way of getting us to see that we cannot ultimately pry apart how we conceptualize and mean a language from how we are disposed to feel and respond, and these from our physical and psychic needs as well as from how we are socialized, civilized, and otherwise trained into a community. Our form of life is what Wittgenstein would call "bedrock." As Stanley Cavell remarks: Nothing insures that we will make, and understand, the same projections. ... [other than] all the whirl of organism Wittgenstein calls "forms of life." Human speech and activity, sanity and com- munity, rest on nothing more, but nothing less, than this.16 Whatever resources one can muster in addressing skepticism are for Wittgenstein to be marshaled through appeal to the notion of forms of life. The tenor of Wittgenstein's appeal has to do with his claim that language is only meaningful against the background of a form of life which the words are somehow about and in which they play a role. (Wittgenstein: "And to imagine a language means to imagine a form of life" [PI, p. 8].) The words "I am in pain" or "slab" are comprehensible to us only if we can imagine a context in which certain beings with certain conceptual and emotional resources employ them for certain ends in certain practices. Just how much of the context must be seen or imagined in order to find the words comprehensible is unclear and probably debatable-probably as debatable as the notion of comprehensibility itself-but if little or nothing of context is gleaned by the speaker, then his or her words will mean little to him or her, and if we cannot similarly glean the relevant contextual factors the words will strike us as intellectually defective, pointless, or incoherent. On this approach, for a skeptical claim to be coherent, we must be able to imagine a context in which people enough like ourselves to be coherently called people at all might actually live that skepticism.17 Spe- 16. Stanley Cavell, "The Availability of Wittgenstein's Later Philosophy," Must We Mean What We Say? A Book of Essays (Cambridge, 1976), p. 52. 17. In order to mean something by one's words when one speaks of a human possibility (a possibility for persons), one's words must be about beings who share our form of life in broad contours and sufficient numbers of details. The idea is that speaking of a being</page><page sequence="14">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 797 cifically for Cage's claim that our ears ought to project neither structure nor anthropomorphic qualities into sound to be comprehensible to us, we must be able to imagine in sufficiently robust detail what it would be for a person to live with ears like that. Skeptical doubt must be given flesh. Cage has of course invited such a context, but in order to pursue his skeptical doubts we need to have a reason to believe that beings sufficiently like ourselves to be called persons could hear sound tran- scendentally (and with what degree of likeliness if they could), which means we need to understand what such perception would be like. Cage's claim seems hard enough to imagine, but one might worry about how much our powers of imagination really tell us about anything. History is replete with examples of things that no one seemed to be able to imagine yet which turned out to happen and hence were clearly human possibilities--possibilities for beings we call "persons" (if not for every person at every time). Hence it might be thought that what we can or cannot imagine proves nothing about what people can and cannot do.'s In fact what we can or cannot imagine does fail to prove anything about what is or is not possible, if what we demand of proof is self-evident certainty. We can never once and for all prove that our inability to coherent- ly represent to ourselves a human possibility is not our current lack- something others might later correct. Neither Cagian nor any other radicalism can be in this Cartesian sense disproved. Therefore we cannot expect to know with the crystalline necessity deriving from Cartesian proof that our concepts of music must be true. However, it was Witt- genstein's aim to show us that the absence of a proof to insure the infallibility of our appeals to the imagination does not warrant that we always have cause to doubt our powers of imagination. This would be, in Wittgenstein's example, like the person who always doubted "before he opened his front door whether an abyss did not yawn behind it" (PI, p. 39). The inability to prove before opening the door that there is not an abyss outside fails to warrant the doubt that there may be one unless one imagines to live out a skeptical situation as a person involves being prepared to treat that being in a certain kind of serious way and to expect the possibility of similarly serious response from it: "My attitude towards him is an attitude towards a soul. I am not of the opinion that he has a soul" (Wittgenstein, PI, p. 178). When we call a being a person, we are disposing ourselves to deploy a web of beliefs, desires, feelings, interests, and practices toward the being, and that only makes sense under the presupposition that the being bears the possibility of by and large responding to our deployment of sensibility in the ways we expect, which in turn means that the being is more or less like us in conceptual and emotional resources. Indeed, what could it mean to say that some tribe has thoughts, practices, feelings, beliefs, and attachments, and views the physical environment in a way totally different from us, and that its members are persons? Why not simply say they are some other beings related to the lion or the martian? What more than that does the use of the word person mean in such a context? 18. Moreover, Wittgenstein's own anti-essentialism and in general the cultural variety and plasticity of resources to our form of life preclude our ever outlining in a completely definitive way what the resources and possibilities of our own form of life are.</page><page sequence="15">798 Daniel A. Herwitz The Security of the Obvious one has a special reason to think otherwise (there is construction going on outside, or war, or the building is dilapidated). The telling questions with respect to skeptical doubt such as Cage's are first that of the degree of conviction with which we can show that the doubt cannot be coherently rendered as an imaginative possibility, and second whether we have some special reason to distrust our appeal to the imagination in the specific case. Put the other way, concerning Cage, the question is of the degree of necessity or security with which we can attain conviction that our claims to know our own ears are true. 3 The analogy between Cage and St. Francis is helpful for determining what strength of argument one can marshal against Cagian skepticism. Certain monks (perhaps more radical than St. Francis himself) desire (like Cage) total detachment from a kind of mind and desire. Like Cage, their strongest view of themselves is that through their acts of detachment they will become more fully people, or better people, not lesser. The question is how disengaged they can coherently be thought to become. These monks can obviously achieve partial disengagement from their ambitions, appetites, and worldly goals. What of utter, total detachment? One might suppose that one can perform the thought experiment of imagining a totally detached monk, but when fleshed out, what one has imagined is never more than relatively pervasive (if equally impressive) partial detachment. One imagines a man engaged in a difficult life task, whose relation to his worldly self is profound, alienated, worked out, deluded, or otherwise problematical. The monk's passions appear in dreams or nightmares, in unnoticed behavior or acknowledged strug- gles-in some way or other. Perhaps the most vivid representation of the monk's project is Dostoyevski's: Father Zossima of The Brothers Kar- amazov lucidly acknowledges his flesh and demands that Alyosha do the same by forcing him out of the monastery and into the world. That Father Zossima is made of flesh is made clear to all by the extraordinary stench of his decomposing body (Dostoyevski's metaphor for expressing the intuition that purity is inseparable from flesh). The thought experiment of imagining a totally detached monk is one we do not know how to begin because it asks us to imagine a person who is not a person. The monk can be called a person only if he continues to embody our form of life with its broad contours of appetite, desire, reaction, and the rest. We are asked to represent a being whom we call a person yet who ceases to embody that web of life, and this we cannot do. Human detachment only makes sense as partial. If a monk really wanted to cease to be a person, he would have to chose more radical techniques than life in a monastery (lobotomy or suicide).</page><page sequence="16">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 799 Cage's project of disengaging the ear from its fixations of mind and desire is similarly problematical. Again, there is no question that partial detachment is possible. We can learn to attend less to the subtleties of musical form and expression and more to the washes of sound in music, just as we can try to hear a language we already know as a rhythm of noise. We can try to listen to works of music as purely natural objects. It is such plasticities of aural capacity which Cage has done more than any other twentieth-century composer to cultivate in arid and arrogant modernist ears. But what of total detachment? Cage asks us to imagine hearing sound as neither structured nor expressive, and we need to imagine what that would be like. Perception is inherently structure-imputing: the eye or ear descries surfaces, seeking coherent patterns. With Cage's proposal that perception cease to do this we seem to lose all grip on the concept of perception. Clearly we need Cage, or somebody, to give the concept of nonstructural perception flesh, to get us to see what it would be like. What Cage does is to provide examples of partially dis-structured perceptual states as metaphors for total loss of structure, and to suggest further that such states, if intensified or generalized, would lead to totally nonstructural hearing. One such example is this: Cage does say that perception of sound should consist in attention to the structure of individual sounds (to their duration, loudness, and so on). Sounds should be presented as merely happening-as sounds unrelated to any other sound except by spatio- temporal location. This proposal preserves a minimal notion of perception as imputing some properties to sound while avoiding any notion of perception as imputing structural relations to sounds. The proposal, gleaned from meditation, works in those instances where sounds come discretely--hence Young's exercise in the cultivation of such discrete hearing (which bears a difficult relation to what we would call music). But in general sound arrives in continuous groups which we must parse into individual sound units on the basis of larger structural principles of phrasing, phonology, music. One cannot imagine how sounds could be otherwise parsed, except by artificial stipulation. It is because Cage knows this that he creates artificial forms for his works to provide us with a kind of parsing which we need not take seriously. But underneath such artificial forms the ear is still beholden to its natural and naturalized principles of parsing. Perception is hard-wired to do this, and its hard- wiring is educated through culture and habit. Another example is this: One imagines a kind of interuterine acoustical environment in which sounds are absorbed in a fluid, unparsed way. This dream of ourselves in such a state of ambiance is beautiful. But it is also a dream in which parsing of sounds still occurs in a more toned- down way. When we dream ourselves in altered states we must somehow hold onto the thread of ourselves: an actual invitation through dream or drug to a totally unparsed, uninterpreted acoustical environment would</page><page sequence="17">800 Daniel A. Herwitz The Security of the Obvious be an invitation to the terror of madness in which that thread of self were lost-not to the beauty of relaxed and unusual perception. Indeed, if consistently applied, Cage's proposal would invite the further terror of nearly complete dislocation from the ordinary; for not only would music be dis-structured, but with it noise and nonmusic generally. Not only would Bach, Beethoven, and what we hear in concert halls be dis-structured, but also the sounds of bird calls, rush-hour New York, and indeed the phonological structure and resonances defining the speaking human voice. After all, the nonmusical is also typically perceived as "musically" structured as well. We hear bird calls and human voices as phrased, rush-hour New York as contrapuntal, airplanes as Wagnerian in musical line. Such perceptions do not only occur at those moments when things which are not music ring beautiful; such perceptions are the norm. These things simply lack the overall coherence or compositional hand of Bach, Beethoven, or a folk tune. Yet the fabric of such noises and other nonmusical events is key to our sense that the world is com- prehensible and familiar, recognizable and a place to live. Indeed, our attachments to the world and to its people are totally intertwined with our sense of sound. Those who are deaf find other routes for cultivating such interconnections. Those who can hear and have developed these connections cannot easily fathom their unraveling. Yet to imagine the loss of this aural fabric not through deafness but simply through ceasing to project structure and inflection onto it is not to imagine the loss of a capacity to hear what one knows the world sounds like. Rather, it is to invite a loss of the inscription of people and of the world in oneself in terms of which the world and others can be known and lived with-as if people and things were staring you in the face but no longer recognizable. That is the condition of lobotomy. Once pressed, each of Cage's suggestions for what totally nonstructural hearing might be like turns out to be incoherent (or the invitation to nothing less than psychological lobotomy). Conspiring to produce the illusion that we can imagine totally nonstructural perception are thoughts about a variety of unusual perceptual states, all of which turn out to be states of merely partially nonstructural hearing. Cage, like the monk, is asking us to imagine a person who is not a person, and this we cannot do. His is a collection of mirages. As a philosopher, Cage's contribution is to have raised certain skeptical questions, but these questions can be given strong antiskeptical response. Cage's radicalism does not represent a coherent human possibility. Although we cannot in a Cartesian sense further prove with absolute certainty that our inability to imagine Cagian radicalism as coherent entails that no person of some other place, time, and resources might not show us to have been wrong about what is imaginable, we have no reason whatever to actually take that doubt seriously. Cagian doubt can be in a strong if non-Cartesian sense disproven. Hence we know the capacities and possibilities of our ears. Our concepts</page><page sequence="18">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 801 of music must in their general contours be true, and it is a condition of rationality that we cannot fail to know this. We have no alternative to our form of life.19 4 What is crucial is that Cage's musical experiments depend on this impossibility for their power, and that in another of his voices Cage knows this. Like Duchamp's Fountain or Matta-Clarke's house split exactly down the middle, Cage's 4'33" is not merely a rhetorical instrument; it is an object transfigured, a modernist epiphany dependent on our ability to do something with it which we cannot do with people.20 4'33" is music destroyed and yet still strangely itself, an object constructed to be an intermediate case: it is too close to music to ignore that connection (through its employment of the form of our performance practices), and too far from music to ignore that connection either (because it issues nothing composed or improvised from the performer). Similarly, we cannot con- struct, even in the imagination, a kind of half-person who both is like us and embodies the Cagian perceptual position. Yet 4'33", once con- structed, takes on the aura of being iconic precisely of that person we cannot imagine. Rhetorically it is meant to deliver us from our fixations on performance to the ordinary sounds of the ordinary world, but poetically it does nothing less than transfigure those ordinary sounds into the extraordinary. Its silence (lack of performed sounds) becomes a metaphor for dis-structuring the ordinary, for producing a hearing of it in a way more immediate than the way we ordinarily hear-as if the sounds now heard were suddenly heard prior to mediation. The work's delivery of compositional structure into the silent immediacy of the Cagian position becomes a mirror of us. We are the ones whom it seems to deliver. In it performer and audience appear joined in silent, nonstructural hearing as sound and silence seem to merge-call that the state of at-oneness with whatever. Such epiphany is no less enthralling and no less close to illusion than the idea that Tristan and Isolde become one in death. It is this sense of transcendence which gives the art its power and makes the performance art.21 19. See Jonathan Lear, "Leaving the World Alone," Journal of Philosophy 79 (July 1982): 382-403. I have found Lear's critical, Kantian approach to Wittgenstein very useful. 20. I have been helped here by the words of Arthur C. Danto, especially by his word "transfiguration" as he discusses it in his book, The Transfiguration of the Commonplace: A Philosophy of Art (Cambridge, Mass., 1981). 21. For the idea of thinking about nonlinguistic objects as part of the figurative analogues of metaphor (what I gloss as a kind of metaphor), I am indebted to Ted Cohen's paper, "Figurative Speech and Figurative Acts," Journal of Philosophy 72 (6 Nov. 1975): 669-84.</page><page sequence="19">802 Daniel A. Herwitz The Security of the Obvious The irony in this is that 4'33" derives this power from its personification. Cage's complaint against ordinary music is that in it "things aren't so clear," that it is treated like we treat a person, heard as a bearer of human feelings, impulses, and intent. But neither are things so clear about 4'33", for in claiming that it reaches out to us with its epiphanic character we are projecting a character onto it, treating it as a mirror of a person transfigured in a way we cannot understand. The work turns silence into an image of our form of life transfigured and aims to lead us or allow us to lead ourselves into that state of transfiguration. As such its persona, like that of Christ, is unavoidably anthropomorphic because it is a delivering image of our form of life delivered. That Cage's art itself depends on personification can be called the exception proving the rule, or what Wittgenstein would refer to as the importance of intermediate cases for our concepts. Cage's Zen voice, I think, knows this. In such a voice Cage believes his radical claims no more than the Zen master believes that one can answer the question of what the sound of one hand clapping is. The Zen master asks his question in full view of its incoherence. It is at best a kind of problematical question, meant to throw the act of questioning and answering into relief. The disciple's frustrated attempts to formulate the sense in such a question are meant to lead him or her to let go of the need to take words as having sense and import. Such letting go need not depend on any belief that one can let go of everything. It is a kind of training (like meditation or riding a bicycle), cultivating a way of seeing. Call this the training of knowing how to act at-one with whatever. In it belief and philosophy need play little role, because one is not being trained to believe anything but rather simply to let go of certain beliefs and attitudes. Cage in his Zen voice offers 4'33" as a way of musically posing such Zen "questions" in the context of Zen training, with the work throwing our acts of music making and hearing into relief, so as to cause us to try to let go of them. However, these Zen practices only make sense against the backdrop of our ordinary concepts and practices remaining in place. The Zen question or Cagian assertion takes its intrigue from its ability to look like (be taken as like) an ordinary question. Remove the ordinary question and the force of its extraordinary cousin would be deflated. In his more moderate voice, Cage acknowledges this: ... Actually when you drop something, it's still with you, wouldn't you say? ... Where would you drop something to get it completely away? ... Why do you not do as I do, letting go of each thought as though it were void?22 22. Cage, "Composition as Process," Silence, p. 47.</page><page sequence="20">Critical Inquiry Summer 1988 803 Cage is speaking of having "dropped" our musical practices. His ac- knowledgement that "it's still with you" casts his claim as being at best about partial detachment. We are never fully detached, so we must "let go" of each thought. This less-than-radical idea corresponding to hi's Zen practice is reflected in Cage's less-than-radical works. Credo in US represents his way of coming to terms with our musical practices by "letting go" of the hold that classical music has on him. In that work he incorporates snatches of classical music into a larger framework of buzzers, prepared piano, and paint jars to be hit, thus diffusing its effect in a Robert Rauschen- berg-like collage. (He also does this through the wit in his writings, as when he says of Beethoven: "It's a shame that artists advertise. However, Beethoven was not clumsy in his publicity. That's how he became known, I believe.")23 This is Cage in his more moderate as opposed to his more radical voice.24 It is worth remarking that what we admire about Cage's project also depends on our conception of it as cast in imperfect, human terms. Such 23. Cage, "Erik Satie," Silence, p. 81. 24. At his moderate best, Cage's performances do no less than invent a musical space in which one really does feel as if any sound that might happen to happen is beautiful in its own right. This heightening of our ears occurs though Cage's skillful blending of structure and chance, and his equally skillful sense of scale. He imposes enough of a score on his musicians to allow for the audience gradually to become familiar with certain repeated sound structures, but also allows his musicians enough freedom in what and when to play so as to make us realize that whatever happens happens in part freely and spon- taneously. Scale is crucial in the design of these performances. Usually for the first forty- five minutes or so everything sounds chaotic, but then, almost suddenly, if audience and work successfully comingle, a shift in perspective occurs. Each sound that happens becomes an adventure in its own right, as interesting as it seems inexplicable. One feels ready for any sound whatever-call that the feeling of at-oneness with whatever. However, only by virtue of the right blending of sounds by a composer with the subtlety of Cage's ears (the sounds of ambulances, too much percussion: these might disturb the growing effect) and the right amount of repetition in terms of which sounds are familiarized does the ear sufficiently internalize an acoustical background in order to open up these powers of focus. Elements of repetition, sound choice, and familiarity define a kind of musical structure internal to the Cage work. Thus the state of at-oneness is a state of partial structure. Furthermore, the work's magical effects are also dependent on a dimension of per- sonification. It is the integration of structure and chance which procures these effects. It is because one knows that each sound is being in part freely offered by a musician (or because each is there for no other reason than that it happens to be there as opposed to its being intentionally placed there by some composer) that each becomes identified with that musician's freedom or with its own freedom. Because each is perceived as free, each becomes worthy of respect in its own right. It is as if a community of sounds is being created like that of a community of persons-a community in which sounds are related to each other-as independent but simultaneously existing, as related and in mutual conversation, each being capable of dropping out if it wants. Music is, to use Cage's term, "identified with life" by becoming the likeness of persons. As in 4'33", the line between sounds and people remains magnificently obscure. It takes what Sch6nberg called an "inventor of genius" to dream up such a situation and to make such a situation work. For an especially effective example of this, see/hear Cage's Soundspace, created for the Cage celebration as part of the Los Angeles Festival of the Arts, September 1987.</page><page sequence="21">804 Daniel A. Herwitz The Security of the Obvious projects as Cage's are appraised in terms set by their masters. Cage, Mozart, St. Francis, and other such masters actually define for us our expectations of what it is possible to do within a discipline. We measure its difficulty, interest, and profundity against what they have done. Man is the measure of man. Cage's virtue is to have mastered a task, set its terms. His virtuosity is to make it appear so natural and easy when we know it to be difficult. We admire that just as we might admire his natural serenity. These qualities of character set the terms of his project in that it is the prospect of achieving them (of relating to the world with that ease and generosity) that makes the project of achieving Cagian ears desirable (call that "waking up to the excellence of life"). Ironically, once we take seriously the idea that total detachment is possible, his terms seem no longer to be the terms. Human mastery becomes little or nothing, comparatively speaking. Cage's work, like Duchamp's, represents the convergence of a rhetorical gesture addressed to the art world to take new sounds or objects seriously, a philosophical questioning with an underlying radical philosophical po- sition, and a kind of metaphor invoking the prospect of transcendence. It is work in many voices, whose richness and relevance encapsulate much twentieth-century cultural ground. Ironically, the power in its metaphor depends on the incoherence of its radical philosophy. What we submit to when we are captured by Cagian epiphany is the sense that we are being detached incomprehensibly from our modes of perception and restored to the totally ordinary, which is now transfigured into the totally extraordinary. To believe in the power of Cage's metaphor is to take his work seriously as art; perhaps seriously entertaining the philosophy behind the metaphor is part of that act of submission. But actually to believe his philosophical voice is to submit not to art but to illusion. That the world can appear extraordinary is possible only because the obvious is secure.</page></plain_text>
