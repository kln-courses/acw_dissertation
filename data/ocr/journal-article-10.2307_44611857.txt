John Jay Gordon GMH Engineering, Inc. ABSTRACT Field accident data suggest that a significant number of occupants involved in rear impacts may be positioned at impact other than in the "Normal Seated Position" - the optimum restraint configuration that has been used almost exclusively in published seat testing. Pre-impact vehicle acceleration from braking, swerving, or a prior frontal impact could cause an occupant to be leaning forward at the instant of the collision, creating a situation where the vehicle "ride-up" potential would be limited. No rear impact tests involving yielding, production-type seats with forward-leaning dummies are found in the literature. Thirty rear-impact sled tests with a forward-leaning, "Out-of-Position" Hybrid III dummy are presented. Tests were performed with a calibrated seat set in either the rigidified or yielding configuration and with the dummy either unbelted or restrained by a production three- point belt system. Test speeds ranged from 5 to 20 mph. The available Hybrid III neck and lumbar instrumentation were used for comparative purposes. Lower injury measures were recorded with the seat in the yielding configuration at all test speeds and for both belted and unbelted dummies. INTRODUCTION In 1987, Collision Safety Engineering (CSE) presented a paper summarizing experimental and analytical research efforts in rear impact protection [Strother/James, 1987]. Specifically, technical papers dealing with the effect of seat back strength on occupant safety were reviewed in an effort to compare the merits of yielding and rigidified seat back design philosophies. Among the conclusions reached in conjunction with that literature review were: (1) yielding seats generally produce lower dummy injury measures as compared to rigid seats tested under the same or similar conditions, and (2) the response of occupants in yielding seats seems to be less sensitive to variations in occupant pre-impact seating position when compared to the response of occupants in rigidified seats. In 1991, another paper discussed the role of seat back deformation on injury reduction in rear impacts [Warner et al, 1991]. It was noted that rigid seats may be appropriate for belted occupants who are sitting in the "Normal Seating Position" (NSP), i.e., with their shoulder blades pressed firmly into the seat back and with their heads close to the head restraint. However, rigid seats may increase the injury potential for occupants in other seating postures. Accident data from the National Accident Sampling System (NASS) files suggested that a significant percentage of rear impact accident victims are not in the NSP at the instant of impact. These data indicated that many occupants who normally sit in the NSP might experience pre-impact decelerations which would alter their position. For example, pre-impact braking could cause the occupant to lean forward and abrupt pre- impact steering could cause the occupant to be displaced laterally. Almost all rear impact experiments reported in the literature have been conducted with dummies in the NSP. Several "inadvertent" or unintentional Out-of-Position (OOP) rear impact experiments were conducted during a series of sled tests using anthropomorphic dummies seated in the rigidified "Integrated Safety Seat" built by researchers at the University of Michigan [Melvin, 1971] [Hilyard,1973]. Comparison of the response of these OOP dummies, having their upper body pitched forward, with the response of the NSP dummies revealed several important differences: (1) Although the sled buck was confined to simple one- dimensional motion (i.e. no pitching motion was simulated), the OOP dummies encountered the seat backs relatively high when compared with their NSP counterparts. Consequently, the head of the OOP dummies overrode the head restraint. (2) Probably as a result of overriding the head restraint, the OOP dummies experienced significantly more ramping than did the NSP dummies. 1501</page><page sequence="2">(3) As an additional consequence of having missed the head restraint, the OOP dummies experienced significant hyperextension. The severity of the hyperextension was aggravated by the fact that there was minimal energy absorption by the rigidified seat back employed in these tests. (4) A significant portion of the energy stored in the ISS seat back was returned to the dummy occupant in the form of a forward and upward rebound velocity. These rebound velocities were significantly greater than those experienced in the corresponding NSP tests. While these " inadvertent " OOP tests are important because they demonstrate significant differences between OOP and NSP responses, they are limited to a narrow range of test speeds and seat designs. Further, the tests were conducted at extreme impact severities: the delta-V's were in the range of 30 to 40 miles per hour. The data from the National Crash Severity Study (NCSS), by contrast, indicates that such impacts represent 98-99th percentile tow-away rear collisions, see Figure 1 [Ricci, 1979]. In addition, no tests of any production-like seats are reported in the literature. OOP tests with typical car seats are virtually non-existent. rear impact injuries [Data Link, 1989]. These weighting factors are presented in the Appendix of this paper. The results of this analysis are shown in Figure 2, which is a graph of the cumulative distribution of rear-impact Harm with accident severity. As can be seen in this Figure, nearly 70 percent of the total rear impact Harm is associated with delta- V's of 20 mph or less, and less than 8 percent of the total rear impact Harm occurs at delta-V's of 5 mph or less. It was decided that the subject experimental program would concentrate on rear impacts in the 5-20 mph delta-V range. TEST METHODOLOGY The Sled Buck The sled tests were conducted at the CSE crash test facility. A moving barrier, with the modifications described in this section, was used as the sled buck. The "sled" is thus an acceleration-deceleration type, i.e., the buck is relatively slowly accelerated up to the impact speed and is then decelerated by impacting the fixed barrier. The deceleration of the buck was controlled by crushing a set of metal drums attached to the face of the moving barrier, see Figure 3. The configuration of metal drums was designed to provide a deceleration profile typical of a passenger car undergoing a rear impact involving the entire rear end of the vehicle. Figure 4 is a graph of the buck deceleration profile from the highest (21.7 mph) impact speed test. The buck decelertion levels were approximately 10 g's. The geometry of the array of barrels relative to the center of gravity of the moving barrier produced little pitching motion during impact. Vents were designed in the barrel end panels to eliminate buildup of pneumatic pressure, minimizing rebound and making the barrier deceleration relatively insensitive to impact velocity. The actual buck deceleration profile is not a critical factor in this type of testing since most of the vehicle deceleration has occurred before the OOP occupant encounters the seat back. For tests involving the "yielding" calibrated seat, the buck configuration included a rear seat back as shown in Figure 5a. For tests involving the "rigidified" calibrated seat, the rear seat back was removed (since no interaction with the rear seat 1502 A sled test program was developed to investigate the differences between OOP and NSP dummy responses in rear impact at more reasonable tests speeds, and with production- like seats. It was decided to conduct tests in the accident severity range of most interest, i.e. in that range where a significant portion of the societal losses due to rear-impact injuries is observed. Data from the NASS accident files, years 1980 to 1986 were used to establish a reasonable impact severity range. All injuries to front seat occupants of vehicles undergoing a Principal Direction of Force of 5 to 7 o'clock were examined. Injuries were first categorized using the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) for each 5 mph accident severity (delta-V) range. The injuries were then combined into a single number using the concept of "Harm" [Malliaris, 1985]. The weighting factors used for each AIS level were those given in the appendix, Subtable B. in the 1989 Data Link Inc. study of FIGURE 1 - CUMULATIVE DISTRIBUTION OF OCCUPANTS INVOLVED IN TOWAWAY REAR IMPACTS (NASS DATA) FIGURE 2 - THE DISTRIBUTION OF HARM TO FRONT-SEAT OCCUPANTS OF REAR-IMPACTED VEHICLES BY DELTA-V - NASS DATA 1 980-1 986-</page><page sequence="3">FIGURE 3 - THE SLED BUCK DECELERATION BARRELS 1503</page><page sequence="4">area was anticipated) to make room for the rigidifying elements. Figure 5b shows the three-point seat belt assembly adapted from a 1985 Chevrolet Cavalier 2-door Hatchback. The Cavalier belt is a continuous loop design incorporating a vehicle-sensitive locking retractor mechanism. Test Instrumentation and Documentation A speed trap was used to measure the sled impact velocity. A single axis accelerometer was also mounted to the moving barrier to document the crash pulse. Each test was documented photographically via video and high-speed cameras as depicted schematically in Figure 6Ä£ After each test, the amount of barrel crush and the final seat back angles were recorded. Dummy instrumentation is described in a subsequent subsection. The Calibrated Test Seat A specially-designed "calibrated" seat was developed for use in this sled test series to minimize the time and expense between the individual sled tests. The calibrated seat was designed to be capable of producing a predetermined torque about the seated reference point by deforming replaceable elements. This allowed the seat to be quickly refurbished between tests, while assuring repeatable deformation characteristics. Two configurations of the calibrated seat were used in this test series: The "yielding" configuration and the "rigid" configuration. Figure 7 shows the calibrated seat in the "yielding" configuration. Figure 7(a) is an overall view of the seat and Figure 7(b) is a close-up of the energy absorbing elements (A) that link the seat cushion frame to the seat back structure. The seat back torque in this configuration is solely determined by the geometry of the two yielding elements (A). These elements were designed to produce an ultimate seat back strength typical of a production seat. Figure 8 shows the static force-versus-angle-change characteristic of the "yielding" calibrated seat. The calibrated seat was designed using parts from a production seat. Modifications that would increase the mass of the seat back were kept to an absolute minimum because an unrealistically high seat back mass could affect the dummy response. As configured, the seat back weight for the yielding seat was approximately 18 pounds, a weight not atypical of production seat backs. The calibrated seat has a 30 1/4 inch high integral head restraint. The early testing indicated the OOP dummy would sometimes deform the head restraint when it encountered the seat back structure. In tests 1 through 7, the head restraint was merely straightened between experiments. This yielding and subsequent straightening logically resulted in a head restraint that was softer as the testing progressed. To ensure that test results were not being affected by the changing compliance of the head restraint portion of the seat back frame, the upper portion of the seat back frame was subsequently modified to allow the replacement of the head restraint after each test. This modification was made after Test 7. Figure 9 shows the calibrated seat in the "rigid" configuration. Figure 9a is an overall view and Figure 9b is a close-up of the elements (B) which were used to give the seat back the necessary additional strength. The maximum torque capability for this seat configuration was set at 56, (XX) in-lbfs. In addition, the seat back was given a high initial stiffness to ensure that it would be essentially rigid under the tested conditions. In order to simplify the construction of the rigid seat, the added strength of the seat back was provided via a pair of force-limiting elements Ð attached to the seat back at about the level of the upper body center of gravity. The piston element, which is pinned to the seat back frame deforms a metal strap of prescribed width and thickness which is attached to the sled buck portion of the apparatus. The static force-versus-angle-change characteristic for the "rigidified" calibrated seat is shown in Figure 10. The effective weight of the seat back in the "rigid" configuration (i.e. the weight of the seat back plus the weight of the moving portion of the rigidifying elements) was 33 pounds. This is greater than that of the "yielding" calibated seat, but probably not inappropriate. The weight of the "rigid" Figure 4 - Sled Buck Deceleration Profile ANGLE CHANGE - DEG.'S FIGURE 8 - CALIBRATED SEAT BACK CHARACTERISTIC - "YIELDING" CONFIGURATION 1504</page><page sequence="5">(a) THE "UNRESTRAINED OOP" (YIELDING SEAT CONFIGURATION) (b) THE "RESTRAINED OOP" (RIGID SEAT CONFIGURATION) FIGURE 5 - ATD PRE-IMPACT POSITIONS 1505</page><page sequence="6">CL ZD I h- Ð¨ (/) I- Ð¡/) Ñ I- _l Ñ CJ I - I CL &gt;- I - I 4Ã Ld CL ID I D i - i Lu 1506</page><page sequence="7">(a) OVERALL VIEW (b) CLOSE-UP OF EA UNITS (A) FIGURE 7 - CALIBRATED SEAT IN THE "YIELDING" CONFIGURATION 1507</page><page sequence="8">(a) OVERALL VIEW (b) CLOSE-UP OF EA UNITS (B) FIGURE 9 - CALIBRATED SEAT IN THE "RIGIDIFIED" CONFIGURATION 1508</page><page sequence="9">seat back is not as critical a factor as it is in the "yielding" configuration, since, seat back movement in the tests involving the rigidified seat was nil. FIGURE 1 0 - CALIBRATED SEAT BACK CHARACTERISTIC - "RIGIDIFIED" CONFIGURATION The objective of these sled tests was to compare the response of an OOP occupant with and without seat back yield. Therefore, the "rigidified" calibrated seat was designed so that it possessed both a high initial stiffness and a high moment capacity, typical of a seat back which is supported at a high elevation relative to the seat pivot. The authors recognize that there may be other seat designs proposed that would not fit the two categories of seats tested in this program. Additional OOP testing of these proposed seat designs may be appropriate in the future. Test Dummy. Associated Instrumentation and Iniurv Criteria The anthropomorphic test device (ATD) used was the Hybrid III 50th percentile male dummy. This ATD was selected primarily because of its neck and lumbar instrumentation. While the response of the Hybrid III neck is not ideal, it is generally agreed that it has the greatest biofidelity of any test dummy presently available. Evaluating injury potential from the Hybrid III neck instrumentation has not been well developed; however, a set of Hybrid III neck injury criteria have been issued by the International Standards Organization (ISO)[Mertz,1984], These criteria are summarized below: 1. The torque at the juncture of the head and neck In extension: 504 in-lbfs. (57 Newton-meters) In flexion: 1681 in-lbfs. (190 Newton-meters) 2. Neck force at the juncture of the head and neck In shear: 247-692 lbfs.(1100 to 3100 Newtons) , depending on duration, see Figure 11. In compression: 247-900 lbfs.,(1100 to 4000 Newtons), depending on duration, see Figure 12. In tension: 247-742.5 lbfs.(1100 to 3300 Newtons) , depending on duration, see Figure 13. The above criteria were used in this program to provide some guidelines regarding the magnitudes of the neck forces and FIGURE 1 1 - INJURY ASSESSMENT CRITERION DUE TO FORE/AFT NECK WITH RESPECT TO HEAD SHEAR FORCE FIGURE 1 2 - INJURY ASSESSMENT CRITERION FOR AXIAL NECK COMPRESSION LOADING FIGURE 1 3 - INJURY ASSESSMENT CRITERION FOR AXIAL NECK TENSION LOADING moments recorded during testing. In addition to determining whether the neck loads are higher or lower for the two seat configurations, it is also useful to determine whether the neck loads represent any potential for injury. While the ISO criteria may not be well enough established to make predictions of specific injury, they do represent the best data available and can be used to suggest the potential for injury. 1509</page><page sequence="10">The ATD instrumentation package is summarized in Figure 14. Since the response of the ATD in these tests was essentially confined to motion in the mid-sagittal or vertical longitudinal plane, a number of channels of dummy data that would otherwise have been necessary were eliminated, simplifying the data collection process. Dummy Pre-impact Positioning Films of human subjects involved in emergency braking demonstrations were reviewed for insights into what would constitute reasonable "pitched forward" dummy pre-impact positions. These films came from two sources. The first was a set of demonstrations done by the Ford Motor Company in the mid-70's during their investigation into likely positions of unbelted passengers during air cushion deployments. These tests involved human volunteers [Ford, 197x]. The second set of data was generated in a limited series of experiments conducted by the authors, in which an unbelted Hybrid III dummy was placed in the passenger seat of a late model sedan in the NSP, and motion of the dummy during emergency stops was videotaped and analyzed. The dummy positions depicted in Figure 5 were selected for use in this program. The position depicted in Figure 5a represents the impact position of an unrestrained passenger either caught unawares by pre-impact emergency braking or thrown forward by a prior, minor frontal impact. Figure 5b represents the same situation for a belt-restrained occupant. It is recognized that these positions are somewhat arbitrary - there are an infinite number of positions that occupants can assume at the moment of impact. For example, sideways occupant motion would be expected in a vehicle which experiences lateral deceleration, such as during a spinout or pre-impact swerving. There was no attempt to simulate these motions in the present test series. Templates were constructed so that the dummy positions could be reproduced with suitable precision during testing. The construction of the Hybrid III is such that he "wants" to sit upright. Also, the sled buck undergoes a low-level acceleration prior to impact. Therefore, a cable and break-away strap, shown in Figure 15 were used as a tether for the ATD. The tether separated with minimal force; it did not alter the occupant motion. TEST RESULTS A total of 32 tests were conducted, however instrumentation problems on tests 2 and 4 reduced the number of useful tests to 30. Twenty of the tests used the "rigidified" calibrated seat, the remaining ten employed the "yielding" calibrated seat. The tests with the "rigidified" seat can be further subdivided into 12 tests with the "unrestrained OOP" dummy and 8 tests with the "restrained OOP" dummy. Similarly, 6 of the tests with the "yielding" seat were with the unrestrained OOP dummy and 4 tests were with the "restrained OOP" dummy. Tables 1-4 summarize the injury measures for these four test groupings. Unrestrained OOP dummy with the "rigidified" seat - Figure 16 is a series of photographs taken from the high speed camera coverage of Test 14, conducted at an impact speed of 12 mph. This figure illustrates dummy kinematics in a typical test of this configuration. Similar figures will be presented in the three subsequent subsections to illustrate dummy kinematics in tests conducted in the other three test configurations, also at an impact speed of about 12 mph. Figure 16a is at the moment of impact. The tethering system has kept the ATD in the intended OOP configuration. Figure 16b was taken 86 milliseconds into the event. The shoulder area of the dummy is coming into contact with the rigidified seat back. During these 86 milliseconds the vehicle (and seat back) have decelerated so that a significant relative velocity between the ATD upper body and the seat back has developed prior to the dummy contact. This is in contrast to the NSP situation where the initial close proximity between the ATD upper body and the seat back allows very little relative velocity to build up. This is why the minimal energy absorption capability of a rigid seat might be adequate for NSP occupants. In the OOP case, however, the minimal energy absorption of the rigidified seat combined with the larger relative velocity results in increased ATD accelerations and internal forces. Also, note that during the period of dummy torso rotation into the seat back, the head orientation with respect to the inertial reference system has not changed appreciably. Therefore, when the dummy strikes the rigidized seat back with the shoulders, the head is in a flexed position with respect to the torso. Figure 16c was taken 128 milliseconds into the event, when the impact between the ATD upper body and the seat back is at its maximum. The head has rotated from its flexed position in Figure 16b to a position of slight extension. Also note that the torso has ramped several inches up the seat back (compare the elevation of the torso in 16b with that in 16c using the background for reference). At this speed, the ramping did not result in the Hybrid III head getting over the head restraint. Figure 16d shows the dummy rebounding out of the rigidified seat, attaining a maximum head elevation at about 300 milliseconds into the event. It is important to note that the method of rigidifying the seat (by attaching the force pods midway up the seat back) minimizes the amount of stored energy relative to a more customary, cantilevered seat structure. In a cantilevered design, the seat back structure would elastically deform to develop the required moment capacity and store significant energy which would be imparted to the dummy during rebound. The sled buck does not have a roof structure, however, it appears that, had a roof structure been present, the ATD would have rebounded "forehead first" into it. Although the velocity of this rebound is not great (estimated from the film to be about 3 mph), the potential for significant neck loading due to body augmentation cannot be ignored. Figures 17 and 18 are graphs of the Hybrid III neck and lumbar response maxima for the unrestrained, rigid seat tests. 1510</page><page sequence="11">z â¡ Å- I Ñ- &lt; I- z Ñ z ZD X I - (/&gt; Z i - i i- Â» ÐÐ§ i- t Ð Å-H QÄ m &gt;~ X I I LxJ o&gt; : Z) ID HH U- 1511</page><page sequence="12">s Ñ g &gt;* &gt;* vi i H 13 0 1 li) ÑÐ i E 1512</page><page sequence="13">TABLE 1 - UNRESTRAINED OOP DUMMY TESTS WITH 56,000 IN.LBF.

Where appropriate, the neck response graphs also contain information concerning the ISO injury criteria. In the case of neck forces, the criteria are time dependent, so only the highest "tolerable" force, namely that at a zero time duration, is shown on the graph. The notations on Figures 17 concerning questionable data refer to issue of the yielding and straightening of the head restraint referred to earlier in the paper. Unrestrained OOP tests with the Yielding Seat - Figure 19 is a series of photographs taken from the high speed camera coverage of Test 25, a nominally 12 mph impact (actual speed 11.3 mph) involving an unrestrained OOP Hybrid III in the "yielding" calibrated seat. Comparison of these photographs with those of Figure 16 indicate several interesting differences which arise when the seat yields and absorbs energy. Figure 19a shows the moment of impact. Again, the tethering system has successfully retained the ATD in the desired OOP during the ride up. Figure 19b is at about 64 milliseconds into the impact. The seat back has deflected from its pre-impact position even though the shoulder area of the dummy has not yet made contact with it. There was sufficient torque applied to the lower region of the seat back by the thoracic/lumbar area of the dummy's back to have initiated seat back yield 42 milliseconds into the event. By the time depicted in Figure 19b, this initial period of seat back deflection is over. Figure 19c shows the event at about 92 milliseconds. The shoulders are just beginning to get involved with the seat back. Again notice that during the first 90 milliseconds, the head orientation has stayed at its pre-impact attitude relative to the ground so that at dummy shoulder contact with the seat back, the head is in flexion relative to the torso. In Figure 19d, about 112 milliseconds into the event, the head has rotated into a basically neutral position. At this time, the second phase of seat back yielding is initiated. In Figure 19e (t = 144 msecs), this second yielding period comes to an end as the rearward motion of the dummy is arrested by the seat energy absorbing process. Rebound is about to begin. Figure 19f shows the dummy in the process of rebounding forward. This photo shows the point where the vertical excursion of the head has reached a maximum (t = 280 msecs). Comparison of Figures 16d and 19f reveal that rebound from the yielding seat is at a much lower velocity, and it does not result in the vertical elevation seen in the rigidified seat test. The ATD in this test came to a final rest position in the seat while the dummy in the rigidified seat test rebounded out of the seat. Figures 20 and 21 summarize the dummy response data obtained during the 6 tests conducted in this series. The corresponding plots from the rigidified seat (Figures 17 and 18) can be compared to these figures to discern the potential of seat back yield in lowering dummy injury measures in the unrestrained OOP situation. The linear regression equations, indicate the following reduction factors for the different dummy response maxima: Neck Forces Tension - 46 percent reduction Shear - 53 " Neck Moments Extension - 41 percent reduction Flexion - 56 " " Lumbar Forces Tension - 35 percent reduction Shear - 22 " Lumbar Moments Extension - 25 percent reduction Flexion - 93 " Restrained OOP tests with the Rigidified Seat - Figure 22 is a series of photographs depicting the dummy kinematics during Test 18, a nominally 12 mph impact (actual speed 12.2 mph) involving a restrained OOP Hybrid III in the rigidified calibrated seat. The kinematics depicted in Figure 22 are generally similar to those of the unrestrained occupant in the rigidized seat, with the following differences. The restrained dummy is initially closer to the seat back, and hence the impact of the ATD upper body with the seat back occurs earlier in the event and with lesser velocity. Also, the seat belt system is effective in limiting the rebound excursions both vertically and forward. Figures 23 and 24 contain plots of the dummy response maxima as a function of sled velocity for the tests in this third series. Comparisons between these results and the earlier results from the unrestrained dummy indicate generally lower dummy injury measures when the dummy is restrained. This reduction appears to be a consequence of the closer proximity of the ATD to the rigidified seat back at the moment of impact. Restrained OOP tests with the Yielding Seat - Figure 25 is the series of photographs from the high speed camera coverage of Test 26, a nominally 12 mph impact (actual speed 12.7 mph) involving a restrained OOP dummy sitting in the yielding calibrated seat. Comparison of these photographs with those of Figure 22 (restrained dummy in the rigid seat) yield conclusions similar to those found when comparing rigid vs. yielding seat kinematics with the unrestrained occupant, (i.e., both the dummy reaction force and the rebound velocity are lower in the yielding seat tests.) Similar to the unrestrained yielding seat tests, seat yield was found to occur in two phases - an initial phase associated with the loading of the seat back by the lower torso, followed (after a short period of no seat yield) by a second period of seat deformation that accompanied the involvement of the upper torso and head with the seat back. The seat belt was effective controlling rebound motion, even though the rebound, as expected, was significantly less than that seen in the rigid seat tests. 1518</page><page sequence="19">FIGURE 19 - UNRESTRAINED OOP DUMMY KINEMATICS (YIELDING SEAT) DURING A NOMINALLY 12 MPH REAR IMPACT (TEST 25) 1519</page><page sequence="20">FIGURE 20 - MAXIMUM HYBRID Ð¨ NECK FORCES &amp; MOMENTS, TESTS IN UNRESTRAINED OOP, YIELDING SEAT 1520</page><page sequence="21">FIGURE 21 - MAXIMUM HYBRID Ð¨ LUMBAR FORCES &amp; MOMENTS, TESTS IN UNRESTRAINED OOP, YIELDING SEAT 1521</page><page sequence="22">FIGURE 22 - RESTRAINED OOP DUMMY KINEMATICS (RIGIDIFIED SEAT) DURING 12 MPH REAR IMPACT (TEST 18) 1522</page><page sequence="23">FIGURE 23 - MAXIMUM HYBRID Ð¨ NECK FORCES &amp; MOMENTS, TESTS IN RESTRAINED OOP, RIGIDIFIED SEAT 1523</page><page sequence="24">FIGURE 24 - MAXIMUM HYBRID Ð¨ LUMBAR FORCES &amp; MOMENTS, TESTS IN UNRESTRAINED OOP, RIGIDIFIED SEAT 1524</page><page sequence="25">FIGURE 25 - RESTRAINED OOP DUMMY KINEMATICS (YIELDING SEAT) DURING 12 MPH REAR IMPACT (TEST 26) 1525</page><page sequence="26">Figures 26 and 27 contain the plots of the restrained dummy response maxima which can be compared to the corresponding Figures 23 and 24 to investigate the mitigating potential of seat back yield for the restrained dummy. Again using the linear regression fits to determine the overall reduction in injury parameters, the following percentage reductions are found: Neck Forces Tension - 61 percent reduction Shear - 51 " Neck Moments Extension - 18 percent increase Flexion - 49 percent reduction Lumbar Forces Tension - 46 percent reduction Shear - 80 " Lumbar Moments Extension - 3 percent reduction Flexion -100 H " (elimination) SUMMARY Four series of rear impact sled tests, totalling 30 impacts are presented. All of these tests were conducted with the dummy Out-of-Position (leaning forward). A calibrated seat was set into either the "rigid" or the "yielding" configuration. The rigid seat was designed to have a high initial stiffness and moment capacity, the yielding seat had a peak moment capacity typical of a production bucket seat. Tests were performed with both restrained or unrestrained dummies. The highest overall dummy neck and lumbar injury measures were observed during tests in the unrestrained mode with the rigid seat. Corresponding tests using the yielding seat back showed reductions in neck forces of on the order of 50 percent and reductions of lumbar forces of approximately 25 percent or more. Tests conducted in the restrained mode resulted in higher forces with the rigid seat compared to the yielding seat and showed the benefit of seat belt use in controlling both the occupant pre-impact position and post-impact excursions. Injury measures observed in the restrained mode were uniformly lower than those evidenced in the unrestrained mode due to the reduction in the severity of the impact with the seat back that accompanied the more proximate position of the dummy. Comparison between tests with the yielding and rigid seat backs revealed that the neck and lumbar forces were, with the exception of neck and lumbar extension moments, reduced by a factor of about 50 percent or more. The lumbar extension moments were increased by only about 3 percent which, in the absence of an injury criterion, may not be of any real significance. Seat back yield in the restrained OOP tests resulted in neck extension moments about 1 8 percent higher than those in the rigid seat tests. At the highest impact severities tested, this increase results in the moments just exceeding the ISO criteria. In view of the fact that the rigid seat dramatically increased neck tension forces under these same conditions ( to the point where the ISO criterion is exceeded by about one hundred percent), the authors feel that the yielding seat back probably results in a net safety advantage. However until the biomechanics community has a better understanding of the mechanism of neck injury and human tolerance in rear impacts, an assessment of the percent reduction in the probability of neck injury accompanying seat back yield would not be warranted.
