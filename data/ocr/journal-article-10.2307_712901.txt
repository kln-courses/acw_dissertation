<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 197 APPROACHES TO LATIN POETRY TONY WOODMAN and DAVID WEST: Quality and Pleasure in Latin Poetry. Pp. vii + 166. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1974. Cloth, ?3.90. The editors of this collection provide an epilogue in which they 'sketch the actual state of literary criticism in Latin poetry as it is represented by this selection of contributors', a self-consciousness of approach characteristic of some of the individual essays. In one sense the concern with method is salutary, particularly for undergraduates, who seem intended as the book's principal audience. Exempla are provided of the manifold approaches desirable in reading ancient poetry. But there are drawbacks. Self-consciousness over method can reach the level of self-indulgence, especially in terms of expensive space on the printed page. Professor Cairns devotes eight sections to the artistry underlying Catullus 31, of which that on poetic craftsmanship is particularly useful. He relates the poem's learning to Hellenistic practice, allowing its humorous possibilities, but it seems excessive to refer 'uterque Neptunus' to the divine partition of the universe and the cultic syncretism of antiquarian mythology. Metonymy and a humorous distinction between salt and fresh water would suffice. He sees the poem as a ring composition: A1 B1 C1 B2 C2 B3 A2, where A concerns praise of Sirmio, B pleasure at returning, and C the journey home from abroad. A2 may be more complex than he suggests, with elements from B and C. He rejects the personification of Sirmio as a slave, justifying this in the section on genre, but might dismiss less cavalierly the notion that the relationship implied is erotic. Professor Kenney's examination of Lucretius 1.62-101 is particularly striking on the use of imagery: Epicurus has exposed 'religio', a monster lowering from the heavens as a folly of man's own creation, and is himself c)Xebcaoso?, a mortal Heracles fighting in the lists of the human mind. Kenney compares the proem to Book 5, but may slightly underestimate the religious ambiguities of both passages, for just as in 5 Epicurus deserves divine honours as euper7??, so here he has some of the attributes of an Orpheus: man's proper study is shown to be himself, and Epicurus his prophet. Kenney contrasts the mythologizing of the historical Epicurus with the presentation in contemporary terms of Iphige- neia's tragic myth. The sacrifice is a ghastly parody of the wedding ceremony as the poet refutes accusations of blasphemy by exposing the evils of 'religio'. Professor Williams expands his treatment of Eclogue 4 in Tradition and Originality, with more stress on the mixture of different levels of poetry. The difficulty of 'magnus. . .ordo' (5) seems underplayed in an attempt to reach a solution. Apollo's role in extending the Sibyl's prophecy and guaranteeing its validity receives an apt Tibullan parallel. The child and the Golden Age develop in three parallel stages. We miss the earlier more extensive treatment of Virgil's use of Catullus 64 although the salient points remain. The remarks on the child's identity are sensible. Virgil is no political innocent and uses ambiguity to back both horses. Dr. Lyne sketches the poetic world of the Georgics, a combination of the Golden Age and the Roman identification of rural and moral life, centred on the</page><page sequence="2">198 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW figure of the 'colonus'. From his admirable analysis of 1.463-514 emerges a picture of nature's violent reaction to the rape of 'terra' by the 'impius Mars' of civil war. Man's true 'arma' had earlier been shown to be agricultural. Now the land fattens on human blood. Farmers will return to reap the rusted helmets, but the cost is great and God's purpose obscure. Hope centres on the young Caesar, but future optimism is hedged by present doubt and the book ends with the chariot of state still a runaway. The argument that the battles of 489-92 are those of Philippi carries conviction, but the interpretation of the Cyclopes is doubtful. As in Aeneid 8 they would stand more naturally for violence contained than for the escape of symbolic monsters. For Professor David West, investigating what sets Horace's town and country mice in a different class from those of Aesop and Babrius, the wit resides in three aspects of the 'anthropomorphic fallacy', dietetic (82-9, 102-11), philo- sophical (90-7), and epic (97-105). Detailed examination of mousy menus and hospitality proves amusing and rewarding. The town mouse appears as a pseudo-Epicurean with a dash of the Platonic preference for the town and a passionate love of jargon. Epic dominates from 97 to 105, culminating in the murine Odysseus and Diomedes' nocturnal raid ('subrepere'). But West neglects the 'pater ipse' of 88, the periphrases of 91, and the Molossian hounds of 111-15 in this respect. Dr. Bramble sets Propertius' Hylas elegy in the Theocritean rather than the Apollonian camp. Here, youth is endangered by an innocence more seeming than real as well as by its own beauty, and this suits the predicament of Proper- tius' addressee. Details are important: the 'fashionable' river names, emotive use of landscape, the addition of the homosexual advances of the Boreads, and the dreamy and erotic artificiality of the waterside vignette. Hylas' curiosity at his own reflection verges on narcissism. I am not convinced of the erotic undertones suggested in the uncultivated fruit trees, but this is a welcome analysis of the poem. Mr. Lee argues that Tibullus' first elegy is more closely integrated than at first appears. He parallels praise of 'otium' from Cicero and Horace but is oddly chary of acknowledging the Georgics. The transition at 41-50 is seen to be crucial, returning to the opening themes as the poet rejects the perils of travel and warfare for gain in favour of love and poverty. A military twist to the paraclausithyron is one of several plays that rejuvenate the cliche of the 'militia amoris', although doubts are cast on the seriousness of a love-poet who was himself a soldier. Dr. Woodman dwells on the sepulchral metaphor in 'exegi monumentum': Horace's pride in the tombstone that is his poetry may be unepicurean but is transparent. We grasp the ambiguity in 'impotens' (3) only at the 'potens' of 12. I am less sure that the 'regali situ' of the pyramids refers to decay as well as altitude. To suggest that Daunus' water shortage is not purely material and that Horace's ability to draw on the springs of native inspiration sets him above the eponymous hero, carries appropriate literary implications. But if we do so inter- pret we must ignore Woodman's plea for ambiguity and take 'qua. . .qua' with 'deduxisse'. Later, 'deduxisse' and the crowning by the Muse suggest the triumph metaphor, but Woodman would also allow the verb the associations of the phrase 'deductum carmen', thus giving 'ex humili potens' a sharper, albeit paradoxical, focus that hints at Horace's frequent claim that both his life and his poetry are 'tenuis'.
