<plain_text><page sequence="1">Murray Code Interpreting 'The Raw Universe5: Meaning and Metaphysical Imaginaries I. On the Problem of Meaning "We are missing," says Annie Dillard, "a whole class of investigators: those who interpret the raw universe in terms of meaning."1 By "the raw uni- verse" she means human experience in all its breadth - "all things cultural and natural." While such a broad definition might seem at first glance useless, since it leaves out nothing, it is nonetheless an excellent place to start an inquiry into meaning in the world. This is because the concepts of culture and nature are used to delimit, as Dillard puts it, "the boundaries of interpretation which the West has accepted since the Enlightenment: man makes sense; nature does not" (LF, 141). This observation goes to the heart of a good many of the diffi- culties. Apart from the perennial puzzle of how to make sense of 'making sense', it has become increasingly doubtful whether nature can be clearly distin- guished from culture. Every rationalistic story about the world must presup- pose, at any rate, the adequacy of the linguistic resources of a particular culture. Furthermore, it must base itself on certain privileged, very general (but not necessarily universal) concepts, or categories. The extreme, and as I argue else- where, ineradicable vagueness of some of our most fundamental concepts indi- cates that the rational investigator of anything whatever can never be more than an adventurer in a labyrinth of ideas.2 Or rather a wanderer in a permanently foggy region best called nature- culture, where the hyphen signifies an intimate reciprocity. For most, if not all, fundamental concepts come in the form of complementary contrasts, or indis- sociable polarities, such as subject-object, body-mind, abstract-concrete. What- ever else Post-Cartesian philosophy has achieved, it has shown in a number of ways that it is not possible to grasp one pole without at the same time picking up the other. That nature-culture needs to be placed high on any list of funda- mental bi-polar contrasts is, in effect, a principal theme in contemporary cri- tiques of modernity. Bruno Latour, for instance, argues that the moderns can be characterized by a concerted effort to totally separate nature and culture.3 However, after following the practitioners of Western technoscience into their laboratories, Latour reports that scientists, those exemplars of modernity, are Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society Fall, 1999, Vol. XXXV, No. 4</page><page sequence="2">699 Murray Code really pursuing two sets of conflicting practices. One set creates mixtures or "hybrids" of nature, culture, and discourse while the other strives to 'purify' them. The implication is that technoscience, widely regarded as the flagship of rationality, is engaged in a self-contradictory project that is underwritten by a hidden Constitution which at once allows what it disallows.4 Latour's investigations thus lend support to the suspicion that, contrary to the popular belief that this enlightened technoscientific civilization is steadily advancing human understanding, modernity has actually helped subvert West- ern ideas and ideals of reason. Under the control and direction of a privileged few, technoscience is proliferating globe-smothering networks of "quasi- objects" or "hybrids" that tend to efface whatever cannot be connected to the webs. Indeed, the near invisibility of the self-contradictory modern Constitu- tion recalls a certain type of controlling myth which Roland Barthes aptly calls the "falsely obvious."5 In other words, modern thought reflects and sustains the power of a grand myth, which might be called the myth of scientific super- rationality, which revolves about the notion that science represents the epitome of rationality.6 Hence the poignancy of Dillard's observation that the class of investigators into meaning in the world contains very few metaphysicians. Despite the fre- quently reiterated claim that scientists and their apologists are ruthless and scrupulous critics of theories and explanations of worldly events, their behavior testifies to a deep-seated reluctance to turn their critical gazes onto their most fundamental metaphysical presuppositions. When coupled with refusals to rec- ognize the profound difficulties inherent in interpretation, a willful ignorance is given license. The doing of metaphysics is conflated with the doing of science and 'naturalisms' are spawned that effectively 'denature' nature. Thus an inter- pretive language has become standardized that both reflects a commitment to and reinforces the nihilistic assumptions of mechanistic interpretations of "the raw universe."7 So it is not too surprising that Dillard believes that what might be called her 'almost empty class of investigators' consists mainly of artists. This type of investigator is at any rate far more likely than the modern metaphysician to re- turn to nature over and over again for a fresh look. Among artists, lyric poets make the best interpreters of "the raw universe," Dillard thinks, just because they are least likely to indulge in pure fancy. Such a concern, one might have thought, should at least be evident in the writings of the more adventuresome interpreters of the Cosmos. But consider those influential mathematical physi- cists who maintain that the universe can be interpreted on the basis of a set of mathematical equations. Some proponents of the Big Bang theory even main- tain that the beginning of all beginnings can be traced to a mathematical "singularity."8 It is as if Something, if not Everything, can in principle be de- rived from Nothing - i.e., a mathematical point-instant which lacks not only extension but also the capacity to interact with anything else. While efforts are</page><page sequence="3">Interpreting the cThe Raw Universe* 700 made to get around the technical anomalies involved in deriving the world from an abstract nonentity, proposals tend to grow ever more bizarre.9 Yet one need only reflect a little on the very aim to derive Everything from a system of mathematical equations, an aim that must surely take in the desire to make the derivation. What else but pure fancy could envisage a deduction of desire, or any other feeling for that matter, from a set of mathematical abstractions? The fact that the neglect of feelings is characteristic of current rationalistic accounts of the world is thus reason enough to think that a good many inter- preters of "the raw universe" indulge in pure fancy. While it is true, as Dillard points out, that many scientific interpretations are manifestly less interpretative than others, the plain truth about rational explanations will never go away: 'hard facts' are nothing but disconnected baubles unless and until they are united in some coherent conceptual framework. Metaphysicians, scientists, and artists are therefore all in the same boat when they sail into the stormy intersec- tion of nature-culture, or better, nature-cultures (for the indissolubility of na- ture-culture, and the manifest differences between cultures, implies that if there is one nature-culture there must be a plurality of them). Since the seaworthi- ness of any metaphysical boat is dependent on how well its fundamental con- cepts hold it together, metaphysical criticism has an affinity with literary (textual) criticism, or at any rate with that besieged school of literary criticism where the meaningfulness of talk about reality and meaning is still upheld.10 Likewise, creative/critical metaphysicians who claim to be engaged in serious work are tacitly committed to the view that some interpretations of "the raw universe" are superior to others; that is, that some articulations actually help throw more or better light on nature and/or the human condition. Yet in view of the complete lack of systematic means for choosing just the right concepts and principles to frame one's metaphysical discourse, the metaphysician inevita- bly comes up against the question of what might justify, if not guarantee, the insightfulness of his/her insights. Briefly, then, the real difficulty in coming to grips with Dillard's problem- atic turns out to be how to locate insights, and their close relatives intuition and imagination, in would-be rational discourse (that is, story-telling that aims to tell something right about how things are in this world). So it is worth stressing that any tendency of scientific interpreters of "the raw universe" to indulge in pure fancy does not necessarily render all their deliverances suspect or misleading. Quite the contrary, since the manifest successes, as well as the inherently speculative (or, to follow C. S. Peirce, abductive), nature of scientific inquiries indicates that there are probably many moments in science that illus- trate what Dillard suggests can be found in the musings of some lyric poets and artists - insights, or 'real seeings-into', nature. On the other hand, if every act of interpretation depends at bottom (as I want to argue) on a happy pooling of a variety of forms of imagination (e.g., mathematical, physical, metaphysical, socio-political, mythopoetical), it is incumbent on any interpreter of "the raw</page><page sequence="4">701 Murray Code universe" to begin by addressing the relation between imagination and reason. This requires, among other things, an engagement with the influential writings of Immanuel Kant whose principal aim in the The Critique of Pure Reason is to reform metaphysics, once and for all. This project depends, he thinks, on taming imagination by subordinating it to explicit rules and regula- tions. Kant's failure to achieve this preliminary goal not only puts into question his conception of rationality, which seems a good illustration of the modernist belief that scientific reasoning is the epitome of good reasoning. He helps dramatize the question of whether, and if so what, science actually contributes to metaphysics. More specifically, the collapse of Kant's science-modelled proj- ect to map the domain of rationality precisely invites a reconstrual of one of his principal insights, that a faculty of imagination is indispensable to both experi- ence and reason. At this point another of Dillard's observations become pertinent: cultural (textual) criticism is on firmer ground than physics ("because cultural phenom- ena occur on an accessible middle ground, and human fabrications fit human understanding" LF, 130). Indeed, a rational explanation that could not be couched in familiar human terms is a dubious candidate for advancing human understanding. Since nothing is more familiar to embodied human beings than their feelings and/or emotions, imaginative anthropomorphic explanations may lie close to the center of rational understanding. This view is consonant with Dillard's claim that artists are particularly well qualified to interpret "the raw universe." Not only are such interpreters unlikely to ignore imagination, they continually bear witness to the fact that feelings, far from being mere epi- phenoma, are foremost among our most concrete experiences.11 But to suggest that feelings or emotions should be counted on a par with, if not before, scientific system in formulating stories about "the raw universe" is to run directly up against the myth of scientific superrationality. Apart from denying the importance of the affective and aesthetic sides of theory-making, this myth anathematizes anthropomorphic explanations tout court. Yet it is not the precision of dispassionate logical or scientific methods, I shall maintain, but rather the 'rightness' of the feelings that accompany the crucial insights which underwrite any metaphysics that ought to be the focus of concern. Or to put this another way, the ultimate worth of an interpretive substructure depends on the quality of the metaphorics, or metaphysical imaginary, that guides the movements of reason. To illustrate these claims I propose to draw upon certain philosophical in- sights of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Sanders Peirce - two highly adventurous philosophers who could never be accused of a lack of respect for logic, system, and science. Yet they help show that an anthropomorphic meta- physical imaginary based on the primacy of feelings can open a window onto the world with a perspective wide enough to take in both science and the full range of human experiencing. In helping to frame a genuinely naturalistic story</page><page sequence="5">Interpreting the 'The Raw Universe' 702 (that is, one in which nature is taken just as seriously as the creatures who study it) of "the raw universe," they even promise to liberate meaning from the nihil- istic constraints of materialism. But since the specter of pure fancy haunts at present the very idea of speculative metaphysics, never mind the legitimacy of anthropomorphic imagery, it is first necessary to clarify the relation between reason, imagination, and metaphysics. II. On the Immortality of Metaphysics Wittgenstein in his Philosophical Investigations depicts the philosopher as conceptual therapist concerned above all with the use and abuse of language. If any examples were needed, one has only to point to the persistence of positivis- tic modes of thought that promote formal meanings on the assumption that meanings that have proved their worth in scientific investigations are self- evidently superior to ordinary meanings (a view taken to its extreme by logical positivists who sought to dispense with metaphysics altogether by establishing an ahistorical, culturally-neutral language based on exact empirical facts se- curely welded together by precise, logico-mathematical symbolisms). On the other hand, the widely acknowledged failures of a variety of positivistic pro- grammes in philosophy of science and mathematics in this century provide good reason to think that good philosophy is utterly dependent on what Rudolph Carnap aptly, albeit dismissively, called 'concept-poets'. The tricky question is, in short, how to balance the creative with the critical side of philo- sophical poetizing. But to start off on the right foot would seem to require a prior socio-cultural critique (perhaps on the model of psycho-therapy, as Nietzsche seems to suggest in the proposed title of a book that he never actu- ally wrote: 'The Philosopher as Cultural Therapist'12). That this is more than a mere intellectual exercise is indicated by pronouncements that sound at first like a death-knell: that 'metaphysics has come to an end'. What is partly at issue is the meaning of the ambiguous word 'end', one of whose meanings is the impossibility of making sense of a traditional, but thor- oughly misguided, form of philosophical inquiry. On the other hand, 'end' could mean closure in the sense of a final recovery from a debilitating "sickness of the understanding" (to adopt a phrase of Wittgenstein's) concerning the na- ture of metaphysics - a sickness that could prove fatal in the long run since the ecological health of the whole planet is at stake. For metaphysical assumptions are at the bottom of predominant conceptions of rational behavior and hence our attitudes toward nature and each other. That the second meaning is the more appropriate one is indicated by the peculiar dynamics of the relations be- tween reason and imagination in Western metaphysics. When this dynamics is examined in a historical light, what stands out, according to John Sallis, is a "massive repression of imagination."13 Traditionally viewed as a high-minded quest for a secure ground where reason will once and for all be protected from imagination, metaphysics exhibits instead furtive tendencies to at once embrace</page><page sequence="6">703 Murray Code imagination while appearing to hold it at arm's length. The implication is that the celebrated rationality of Western thought is based on an appropriation and rejection of that which provides it with its mo- mentum. As Sallis remarks, beginning with the Platonic texts, where "imagination both empowers and inhibits the metaphysical drive to pres- ence" (Del, p. 7), metaphysics has striven to realize a contradictory telos.14 The consequent repression of imagination is perhaps most in evidence in Kant's Critique of Pure Reason which appears to be "a pivot on which modern thought turns ... most decisively" (Del, 4). This work, as Kant makes clear in the preface to the second edition of the Critique^ aims primarily to rescue metaphysics from being a mere battleground of opinions based upon "random gropings." He aspires in fact to nothing less than the articulation of a "thoroughly grounded metaphysics" capable of acquiring "an exhaustive knowledge of its entire field."15 So it is not merely ironic that Kant's project to set metaphysics on "the secure path of science" relies at certain crucial points on metaphors which, in the light of his overriding desire for apodeictic cer- tainty, ought to be among the first of the "fancied possessions" of speculative reason to be jettisoned. Kant speaks, for instance, of the need to repair and level a ground that has been deformed by the mole-tunnelings of previous warring metaphysicians. Such 'metaphorings' cannot be brushed aside as mere literary embellishments since they raise a fundamental question: "how can critique explore the ground all the way down to the bedrock except by tunneling down to it in a way not unlike that very mole-tunneling whose effects critique would expunge?" (Spc, 7). Yet Kant's treatment of this ur-question undermines his whole project (which depends on his being able to map the domain of rationality exactly) since it raises an even more fundamental question: how could one resolve the problem of "reason's route to itself," a problem that, as Sallis aptly notes, "threatens to produce an utter rout of reason" (Spc, 71)? A critique of Kant's Critique must therefore immediately concern itself with the adequacy of his conception of rationality . This is not a straightforward matter, according to Sallis, since "the critical reason traced in the Critique of Pure Reason harbour[s] a metaphorics...[and hence] a reading of that text re- quires not only a hermeneutics but also a poetics." Yet he also notes that "the outbreak of metaphor that occurs near the end of the Transcendental Analytic is without parallel elsewhere in the Critique of Pure Reason" (Spc, 69). It is thus highly significant that here we encounter the image of a sparse and iso- lated northern island (a "land of truth") that is surrounded by foggy, deceptive seas in which speculative reason is forever tempted to roam and get itself lost.17 That this image of rationality is central to Kant's project is evident in his confi- dent assertion that we are "under compulsion to be satisfied [with what this 'island of truth' contains] inasmuch as there may be no other territory upon which we can settle" (CPR, 257: A236/B295). Yet this compulsion appears to</page><page sequence="7">Interpreting the The Raw Universe' 704 owe much, if not everything, to a prejudgment concerning rationality itself. For the island imagery has, as Sallis notes, "a certain priority over the text and to that extent governs it - [it expresses] in short, a prearticulation" (Spc, 70). In view of the powerful influence of the Galilean-Newtonian interpretation of science on Kant's conception of rationality, one may therefore ask whether Kant's use of the island imagery is an especially important illustration of the power of the myth of scientific superrationality. What else but such a myth could legitimize a refusal to allow imagination to enter the front door of Rea- son even as it is being covertly let in at the back? Granting the pivotal influence of Kant's first Critique, perhaps only the combined efforts of psycho-social ana- lysts, cultural anthropologists, and metaphysical concept-therapists are capable of treating the sicknesses of understanding brought on by the repression of imagination in Western metaphysics. For Kant's imagery fosters an 'islanded consciousness' whose exclusionary and coercive tendencies appear closely bound up with what Michèle LeDoeuff calls "the shameful face of philoso- phy."18 This face is frequently worn by modern philosophers who introduce, at certain critical junctures, a purportedly decorative metaphorics that silently serves a more serious purpose. Such moments mark important points of tension in philosophical texts, says LeDoeuff, since the images "sustain something which the system cannot itself justify, but which is nevertheless needed for its proper working."19 Yet the monumental stature of the Critique of Pure Reason also demon- strates that the lasting worth of any great text in philosophy is due not so much to the sweep and cogency of its arguments as to the depth of its insights. And it seems hard to overestimate the importance of Kant's principal insight: that ex- perience can only be explained in terms of imaginative syntheses of the sensible and the conceptual. In the first edition of the Critique Kant explicitly evokes a faculty of imagination which he calls "a blind but indispensable function of the soul, without which we should have no knowledge whatsoever" (CPR, 112: A78/B103). However, in the second edition he strives to subordinate this "function of the soul" to the rules of understanding, an aim that surfaces in the text in close association with the island imagery. Thus Kant's treatment of imagination suggests an overweening desire to protect at all costs his precon- ception of rationality from a potentially anarchic and mysterious creative imagi- nation.20 Be this as it may, Kant's inability to tame imagination, and thus to live up to his promise to reform metaphysics once and for all, invites a return to his original insight - that there is an originary (or to use Coleridge's term) pri- mary imagination involved in the very constitution of experience. Indeed, a productive, or creative, faculty of imagination may be involved not only in the production of the unities precipitated in perception, it may prefigure the work- ing of more secondary forms of imagination involved in knowledge-making. For individual acts of experiencing are always embedded in historical, cultural,</page><page sequence="8">705 Murray Code biological, and geographical contexts and thus possess idiosyncrasies that re- flect, for instance, the workings of a socio-cultural imagination. In so far as such 'local', non-scientific cognitionary factors are relevant, a neo-Kantian ap- proach to imagination is not only inadequate, it is seriously misleading. That is to say, rather than trying to emulate (as Kant puts it) "the example set by the geometers and physicists," it would be wiser for metaphysicians to try to emulate the work of certain poets. Such a conclusion is implicit in Sallis's summing of his account of the dynamics of reason and imagination: the am- biguous phrase 'the end of metaphysics' actually heralds "the release of imagi- nation into the entire field, the return of the repressed" (Del, 15). Finally liber- ated from its modernist strait-jacket, metaphysics no longer need pretend to be a 'drive to pure presence' (or a Kantian drive to discover reason's one true self). If any sort of drive is involved, it is that which Aristotle originally linked to a desire for understanding, a word that suggests a yearning to become ever more present. But relinquishing forever the futile hope of achieving a state of perfect presence, in which the world will appear with perfect transparency, the meta- physician may nonetheless believe that his/her efforts to 'see' are, pace Kant, no more or less like "random groping" than the efforts of lyric poets. The latter at least know that the object of their desires has to be approached indirectly, over and over again. Thus if a metaphysician senses the approach of an 'end', he/she is really only perched on the verge of yet another beginning; indeed, of an endless series of beginnings, for Kant is quite right to insist that "there has always existed in the world, and there will always continue to exist, some kind of metaphys- ics" (CPR, 30). Except that no metaphysics can ever be a science modeled on the work of "the geometers and physicists." It is essentially an art involving the creation-criticism of open-ended systems of privileged, very general concepts whose worth is ultimately dependent on happy choices of imagery.21 Kant's own efforts, as it happens, nicely illustrate this crucial point. His appeal to the image of an isolated, ascetic island of rationality at a critical juncture in his rea- soning demonstrates that few choices in metaphysics are more important than those that guide the movements of reason itself. Yet his island imagery appears adequate in one respect only. Speculative reason is only partially free since it is constrained by the 'local' circumstances ordained by history, culture, and na- ture. Furthermore, before it can begin to move in any measured way, it is obliged to decide how to enter a thicket whose openings are marked only by blurry sign-posts. The inescapable vagueness of fundamental insights is not, however, a reason for epistemological despair, as some neo-Kantian rationalists would have it. An ineradicable vagueness indicates rather an everlasting need for creative-critical metaphysicians. Reason informed by imagination can always hope to discover new and more promising routes through the labyrinths of ex- perience. Far from being like a firmly anchored and bounded Kantian island of truth, then, a domain of rationality is more like a sensitive organism floating in</page><page sequence="9">Interpreting the "The Raw Universe' 706 a vast sea and trailing tentacles in every direction. III. On Anthropomorphic Imagery Doubting the adequacy, let alone the 'rightness', of neo-Kantian 'islanded' imaginaries, the metaphysician can only cast off in search of a better, or better imagined, metaphysical imaginary. If metaphysics is really akin to poetry, he/she should expect to encounter en route poet-philosophers with similar concerns and interests, although many might at first glance appear to be in- dulging in pure fancy. A case in point is the fantasist Italo Calvino who explic- itly attaches a metaphysical significance to his writings. He remarks, for in- stance, that "I wish my picture of things to be valid not only for today but also for tomorrow."22 Interestingly, he also holds that this essentially metaphysical desire can be satisfied by means of imagination; that it is possible to acquire "a knowledge that is outside the individual, outside the subjective" by means of a well-chosen imagery. Just as pertinent is Calvino's claim that "although science interests me just because of its efforts to escape from anthropomorphic knowl- edge, I am nonetheless convinced that our imagination cannot be anything but anthropomorphic . "23 Calvino thus proffers a challenge to philosophy: to produce, if it can, a metaphysical 'concept-poet' whose use of anthropomorphic imagery is capable of linking reason to feelings, knowledge to desire, and perhaps even meaning to chaos and disorder. Whitehead is foremost among the few contemporary philosophers who are able to respond to such a challenge. Apart from explicitly stating (in the preface to Modes of Thought) that philosophy is akin to poetry,24 he suggests that a good metaphorics is the secret to a good metaphysics. In one of his Harvard lectures, for instance, he observes that "any metaphysics is a good metaphysics which takes you a good long way without its metaphors breaking down."25 Furthermore, he unapologetically invests anthropomorphic metaphors with primary metaphysical significance.26 Thus the first question that needs to be addressed is whether there is any reason to believe that Whitehead's choice of an anthropomorphic metaphorics, in which feelings (and related notions such as desire, appetite, and satisfaction) play an important role, is an offense against minimal standards of rational dis- course. Or whether he is merely guilty of violating arbitrary taboos imposed by dominant interpretations of rationality. Given the oft-noted connection be- tween the coercive, even violent and tyrannical, modernist view of the function of reason and mechanistic metaphysical imaginaries,27 it is worth stressing that Whitehead's interpretation of the fiinction of reason is informed by a deep con- cern to overcome the divisive tendencies of Western philosophical thought. In- deed, he succinctly sums up the problem by noting a general willingness to see both ends of a stick while refusing to see the stick itself.28 Now no experiences can be more familiar to embodied warm-blooded, sentient human beings than the flux of interacting feelings and thoughts which</page><page sequence="10">707 Murray Code permeates both conscious and unconscious (e.g., dreaming) existence. Fusing and dissolving in transient emotions, these representatives of the categories of objectivity and subjectivity respectively (for thoughts belong to the domain of the public and feelings to the private) are surely foremost among the aspects of experience needing to be saved by any metaphysics. Or at least any metaphysics intent on grasping the whole stick of experience. How to do this is surely Plato's bequest to Western philosophy: the challenge of writing a footnote that shows how to bridge the chasm that he opened wide between the sensible and the intelligible. That a metaphoric imagination might be indispensable to this project is evidenced by the blurry relationship between subject and object. Another indi- cation is the ineradicable and (to use Peirce's words) especial vagueness of the "acritical indubitable beliefs" that ground would-be rational discourse. In so far as vagueness and generality go hand in hand, metaphysics (which is chiefly concerned with 'large' generalities) cannot avoid being, first and foremost, a search for appropriate metaphors.29 Yet a good metaphorics is just that, only a more or less satisfying means of carrying meanings across gaps that cannot be spanned by literal or dictionary meanings. Thus a metaphysical imaginary stands or falls on the wisdom of its privileged imagery. Here philosophers dis- play their kinship with lyric poets. Both types of interpreters of "the raw uni- verse" must rely on 'feelings of Tightness' in their search for 'true' metaphors to link hitherto unarticulated meanings into the unified wholes that understand- ing demands. The trouble is that such feelings are unreliable, or likely to be swamped or denied by dullness, custom, and habit, which is hardly surprising given that this activity must take place in a blurry region where the sensible and the intelligible meet and mingle, sometimes promiscuously, sometimes fruit- fully. That 'true' metaphors cannot easily be distinguished from 'false' ones is thus no argument against the existence of 'real' insights. Whether or not an insight represents a genuine 'seeing-into' reality can thus be said to be the burning question behind every metaphysical impulse. And there is no avoiding bringing feelings (or better, emotions) into this problematic since there is nothing else except feelings that could recognize something as an insight in an area of inquiry where pragmatic testing and controlled experimentation are not possible. Briefly, then, the indispensability of feelings in the creation/criticism of metaphysical imaginaries bears witness to the total arbitrariness of bans on an- thropomorphic imagery. This conclusion can also be reached, interestingly enough, by way of Peirce's investigations into the nature of scientific discovery. Maintaining that abduction is behind every introduction of novelty in science, he observes that such moments are also common in ordinary perception where abductive inference shades into perceptual judgment</page><page sequence="11">Interpreting the "The Raw Universe' 708 without any sharp line of demarcation between them; or, in other words, our first premisses, the perceptual judgments, are to be regarded as an extreme case of abductive inferences, from which they differ in being absolutely beyond criticism. The abductive suggestion comes to us like a flash. It is an act of insight^ although of extremely fallible insight. (CP 5.181) The term 'inference' is somewhat misleading, however, since abduction is not so much a form of reasoning as a type of guessing that frequently issues in fruitful hypotheses. Indeed, Peirce holds that abduction cannot be mere guess- ing on account of the number of occasions when only a few guesses are needed before the right one is hit upon. The manifest successes of abduction therefore show that "the human mind is akin to truth,"30 a conclusion that suggests in turn that abductive insights must be 'real seeings-into' reality. It is thus signifi- cant that abductive movements of mind, and hence uncriticizable insights, are implicated in Peirce's defences of anthropomorphic explanations. Objecting to the narrowness of the idea that anthropomorphic explanations are unscientific, he remarks that 'Anthropomorphic' is what pretty much all conceptions are at bottom; otherwise other roots for the words in which to ex- press them than the old Aryan roots would have to be found. And in regard to any preference for one kind of theory over another, it is well to remember that every single truth of sci- ence is due to the affinity of the human soul to the soul of the universe, imperfect as that affinity no doubt is. (CP 5.47) Or again, every scientific explanation of a natural phenomenon is a hy- pothesis that there is something in nature to which the human reason is analogous; and that it really is so all the successes of science in its applications to human convenience are witnesses. They proclaim that truth over the length and breadth of the modern world. (CP 1.316) If one grants, then, the centrality of abduction in rational inquiry, and that some perceptions are in a sense needing elucidation real 'seeings-into' reality, the feelings of 'rightness' that accompany such 'seeings' must be accorded a kind of 'firstness'. In other words, the 'feelings of Tightness' associated with genuine insights are bound up with the sort of feelings that Peirce speaks about in connection with Firstness (the first of his three principal metaphysical cate- gories, in which feelings are sui generis). Since I shall return to this topic later,</page><page sequence="12">709 Murray Code it must suffice at the moment to note that in so far as feelings are 'first' in any sense of the word, anthropomorphic metaphysical imaginaries that include them are not only legitimate, they may also be inescapable. But given the current intellectual climate, it is necessary to add that there is no reason to fear on this account a sudden onset of anarchy or chaos. To take insights seriously at least precludes an extreme relativism. On the other hand, if uncriticizable moments of inspiration are intrinsic to the abductive movements of mind which produce genuine novelty in scientific theorizing, the develop- ment of mathematics in this century (which has produced a good many highly abstract structures that appear to have no direct bearing on concrete events) indicates that it would be better to speak of imagination, or imaginative intui- tions, instead of 'insights' or 'seeings-into'. In other words, a very large space (encompassing both the highly abstract and the fully concrete) has been opened up for "the return of the repressed." But this is far from proclaiming a complete freedom of imagination. Despite the profound difficulties which this occult notion spawns, some headway in understanding the insightful and/or the intuitive/imaginative side of knowledge-making is still possible provided one can show whether, and if so how, imagination can be fitted into an ac- count of "the raw universe" that saves something of the traditional meaning of objective truth about nature without sacrificing the socio-cultural element in knowledge-making. This can only be done, I earlier suggested, by renouncing the modernist temptation to dichotomize key conceptual contrasts, or polarities (such as sub- jectivity-objectivity, feeling-thought, private-public, and nature-culture). In what follows, then, I shall attempt to illustrate what I take to be a fundamental metaphysical principle: always and everywhere "the raw universe" exemplifies the dynamic tensions exemplifed by polar conceptual contrasts. That it is a fatal error in philosophy to divide what can only be distinguished (to use the words of Coleridge) is in fact one of the chief merits of Whitehead's approach to metaphysics.31 An explicit intention to reconcile subjectivity and objectivity un- derwrites his choice of a metaphorics based on the notion of organism. At the same time he invests the whole world with various grades and degrees of sen- tience, from bottom to top, since not only embodied, conscious human beings illustrate the intimate interplay of subjectivity and objectivity. Every organism is a sentient actor in nature in so far as it is at once an engaged participant in and a restless maker and re-maker of its environment. Beginning from such elementary observations ("Here we are\ We don't go behind that, we begin with it"), Whitehead aims to show that the world framed by the metaphor of Process can be elucidated by an analysis based on the meta- phor of organism. Yet the latter trope allows for a stretching of the core mean- ing of 'life' to apply to all sub-processes within Process, in accordance with the method of "imaginative generalization."32 Such a heretical move is an affront to the materialistic point of view, although it does not conflict with precise sci-</page><page sequence="13">Interpreting the The Raw Universe' 710 entific investigations of elementary physical processes, as I will argue below. Indeed, Whitehead is generally in agreement with modern science on a good many crucial points, yet he could hardly have launched a metaphysics more likely to provoke the charge of indulging in pure fancy. To take him seriously is to come face to face with the possibility that 'matter' not only evolves, it has an imaginative core to its 'insides'. It would therefore be useful to try to sketch a metaphysical imaginary in which these claims make sense. IV. An Anthropomorphic Interpretation of The Raw Universe* To back up my suggestion that only an anthropomorphic metaphorics based on the most salient aspects of public and private experiencing can do proper justice to an undualized nature-culture, I propose to amalgamate what I take to be major insights of both Peirce and Whitehead. For there is no other way to begin a rationalistic story about "the raw universe" except on a basis of privileged insights and intuitions.33 The Peircean-Whiteheadian imaginary I shall sketch does not play down the achievements of modern science. Quite the contrary: it is in accord with some of the more remarkable deliverances of mod- ern physics which have, as it happens, undermined some basic assumptions of mechanistic metaphysical imaginaries. These derive from the practical successes of the "scientific revolution" of the 17th century which encouraged assumptions about matter that still govern much so-called naturalistic philosophy. For the early modern naturalists dethroned an organicistic view of matter as essentially active and substituted a conception of passive matter that permitted explana- tions of physical phenomena in terms of mechanical metaphors (e.g., as the consequence of 'blind' impingements of inert bits of 'stuff moving in a pre- existent space-time container). But rather than being comprised of inactive, immutable entities subject only to the laws of locomotion, the more primitive elements of matter, such as the 'elementary particles' of modern physics, turn out to be only more or less localized structures of incessant activity. As such they are akin to sentient organic bodies with their own internal sources of mo- tion since they owe their existence as enduring entities not to an underlying substance but rather to periodic repetitions. Their 'beings', in short, cannot be divorced from their 'becomings'. Thus science tells us (very vaguely) that at or near the ground of primitive physical existence there exist intrinsically mutable entities whose apparent 'solidity' reflects the stability of complexes of internal and external relation- ships, just as Whitehead maintains.34 Furthermore, in so far as the characters of fundamental physical entities qua 'natural beings' must ultimately be inferred from their interactions with other such beings, their constitutive relationships are amenable to analysis in terms of communications, or 'exchanges of bits of significant information'. Modern physics, in short, suggests the need for a genuine naturalism based not on scientific abstractions but rather on a meta- phorics of signs and organisms, since the former are the sine qua non for any</page><page sequence="14">711 Murray Code type of communication. Organisms are natural candidates for both the sources and termini of communicative interactions since an organism that is incapable of reacting to any sign whatever is, or is soon to be, a collection of bits of dead matter; that is, a corpse. A sign-organism metaphorics is also conducive to an undualized nature-culture which is, in the first instance, comprised of inter- twined, only more or less localized, enduring, and independent organic bodies 'here' in various semiotic relationships with other bodies 'there'. Now one of the great merits of Peirce's interpretation of semiotics is that, in accordance with modern physics, a semiosis (or sign-transaction) is inher- ently non-deterministic since every such event involves three factors: an object, a sign, and an interpretanti A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to some- body for something in some respect or capacity. It addresses somebody, that is, creates in the mind of that person an equivalent sign, or perhaps a more developed sign.... [which is called] the interpretant of the first sign. (CP, 2.228) This factor of indeterminacy is, in other words, part and parcel of the indis- pensable interpretive dimension, a consideration that becomes especially sig- nificant, from an ontological point of view, when Peirce ventures beyond the sphere of human communications and cryptically observes that "the entire uni- verse ...is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs" (CP, 5.448n). He thereby points to a picture of "the raw universe" that draws a good deal from the wisdom implanted in the metaphor of sign. At the same time, however, the factor of indeterminacy raises the problem of how to inter- pret the interpretative activities in the semioses themselves, especially at levels of existence 'lower' than those occupied by creative human beings. A possible counterpart to Peirce's insight is Whitehead's heralding of his account of Process with a quotation from Sir Francis Bacon: "It is certain that all bodies whatsoever, though they have no sense, yet they have percep- tion..." (SMW, 41-42). For modern science points to the need for an organi- cistic view of matter as essentially active and analyzable into primitive 'bodies', or organisms, in communicative relationships. These fundamental actualities, or "actual entities," constitute (according to the Ontological Principle as offi- cially spelled out in the categoreal scheme of Process and Reality) the terminus of every quest for reasons and understanding. Whether or not an ultimate level of organic activity exists, every actual en- tity illustrates a character common to all organisms - a dynamic interpenetra- tion of being and becoming. This character Whitehead believes can best be un- derstood in terms of human perception. Consider, then, a visual perception. Such a dynamic event presupposes an embodied perceiver possessing special- ized organs capable of responding to certain kinds of stimuli and of mustering</page><page sequence="15">Interpreting the The Raw Universe' 712 whole complexes or co-operative groups of specialized cells into a collective project - making sense out of floods of information. While such a rough de- scription only touches on a few of the difficulties involved, which include an imaginative activity in the higher stages of integration, it is at least a useful re- minder that it is no more possible to isolate any stage of such an event than it is possible to isolate a functioning cell in the society of cells that constitute a par- ticular organ (i.e., society of societies of cells) in a living body. It also helps bring out the central mystery of consciousness, which is emergence. In materi- alistic accounts of sentience the emergence of consciousness is sometimes held to be analogous to the emergence of special biological functions in evolving organisms. More often than not it is assumed that the pivotal notion of emer- gence is amenable to neo-Darwinistic interpretations of evolution based on the principles of random mutation and Natural Selection (interpretations that pre- suppose in turn the adequacy of mechanistic materialistic imaginaries). But to assume that consciousness can be reduced to chemical and/or electro-magnetic interactions involving neural networks, or whatever, is to ignore the negotia- tions implicit in the emergence of unities whose constructions frequently de- pend on interpretations of mere possibilities. That is to say, acts of perception usually involve a synthesis of factors aris- ing from two different sources: what has already come to be and what is not yet but could come to be. It is thus highly significant that the generic form of expe- riencing that Whitehead attributes to primitive organisms both conforms to and accords cosmic significance to what I take to be Kant's principal insight: that experience generally presupposes a synthesis of the sensible and the con- ceptual.35 In Whitehead's philosophy, this synthesis involves 'real potentialities' arising from the external or 'sensible' side of organic experiencing; that is, the abstract forms of order exemplified by what has already become. He also refers to this 'sensible' (or perceptual) component as a kind of grasping (or prehen- sion) of 'physical feelings', which are actively synthesized with conceptual feel- ings that arise from the "internal" side of becoming. Feelings are thus 'first' in every sense of the word in Whitehead's account of Process, which implies that consciousness is always secondary and derivative from more primitive forms of sentience.36 In Whitehead's 'large' picture of Process, then, the 'perceptual' side of physical existence is bound up with negotiations. The backward looking face of every becoming (which is concerned with the peculiar abstract "forms of definiteness" manifested by what has already become) exists in dynamic tension with the forward-looking face which sometimes finds itself entertaining pure possibilities - that which might be relevant to whatever end is presupposed by the act of becoming (since every act must have a goal, however vague). But in so far as the becomings of certain human acts of perception depend on insights, this activity elicits another type of metaphor - imaginative participation. The point is, to speak intelligibly, comprehensively, and rationally (in the sense of</page><page sequence="16">713 Murray Code getting something right about reality) requires an interwoven complex of many types of metaphors, some of which are anthropomorphic. Both conscious and unconscious mental activity point to fleeting private-public negotiations involv- ing countless integrations and decisions, not to mention imaginative interpreta- tions arising from selections, gradations as to relevance, and so on, of pure pos- sibilities as well as 'real' potentialities. Conceived as an evolving order of orders of convoluted semi-autonomous constructive activities (since there is no reason not to think that the sub- processes of Process are all comprised, to greater or lesser degree, of 'inner' processings stimulated by 'outer' influencings) a picture of the "raw universe" emerges which is anything but simple. Individual 'bodies' in evolving societies of societies of organisms appear to be no more amenable to analysis in isolation from their 'local' conditions of emergence than the development of macro- biological organisms can be separated from their geographical environments. It is thus somewhat ironical that simplicity is upheld as the chief merit of neo- Darwinian interpretations of evolution based on the two principles of random mutation and natural selection. Mechanistic materialism makes a fetish of sim- plicity, when viewed in this light, a device to ward off the possibility that crea- tivity is intrinsic to a thoroughly evolutionary world. Yet creativity can no more be directly grasped than dismissed out of hand. If one grants that the chief characteristics of ordinary perception reflect the ba- sic characteristics of Process, the factor of creativity in the interpretative dimen- sion of human perception suggests that the how of the communicative nexus of organisms holds the key to making any further headway. Recall Whitehead's insistence that becoming is in principle always underdetermined inasmuch as new possibilities can enter through the conceptual side of experiencing. His interpretation of Process thus implies that an element of self-determination is present, at least in principle, in every act of becoming. In accordance with the method of "philosophic generalization", then, the notion of imagination can be "stretched" to apply to all forms of worldly organization, from the 'percipient events' of 'higher' organisms down to those of elementary physical becomings where habit (e.g., sheer repetition) is virtually, although not abso- lutely, sovereign. This is because "self-determination is always imaginative in its origin" (PR, p. 245). With this extraordinarily bold (or, as I am suggesting, remarkably insight- ful) observation, Whitehead rescues Kant's principal insight, that a faculty of (productive) imagination is required to explain experiencing tout court. Inas- much as the theory of organism is essentially a theory of experiencing, in which every act of becoming is a form of experiencing, there must be a factor of self- determination, and hence creative imagination, woven into the very fabric of Process. That is to say, the activity inherent in the actualizations of matter, which involve an interplay between conceptual feelings and physical feelings in the becomings of actual entities, requires a (usually unconscious) creative, or</page><page sequence="17">Interpreting the cThe Raw Universe* 714 productive, imagination to account for whatever creativity is manifested by na- tura naturans}7 My claim is that Peircean semiotics is especially helpful in elucidating this highly unorthodox (to the modern mind) interpretation of order and organiza- tion. Treating the notion of sign as a natural complement to Whitehead's key metaphor of organism, and following through with Peirce's aper$u that the whole world is perfused with signs, one is led to an undualized conception of experience-reality in which habit exists in dynamic tension with creative imagi- nation. For whatever orderliness there exists in a world perfused with signs must derive from a tendency in semiosis to form stable habits of sign- interpretation. That the anthropomorphic metaphor of habit is superior to the 'classical' metaphor of (transcendental, immutable) law for describing the order in nature follows from the fact of emergence of new forms of order. This notion implies that, far from being a static given, the order of nature is akin to the organiza- tion exhibited by more or less rigid forms of communication, or stable net- works of semiotic habits. Furthermore, unlike an immutable law of nature, an existing habit of semiosic organization can always be broken to make way for a new habit.38 This latitude is guaranteed by the triadic nature of semiosis. Ex- cept where rigid habit (or blind instinct) predominates, which may very well be the norm even in the majority of cases of human semioses, changes in semiosic habits are always possible through the entertainment of new signs, or by novel interpretations of old signs. That is to say, the triadic nature of semiosis indi- cates that the power of signs to communicate meanings must be distributed across objects, signs, and interpretants. Objects have the power to signify their presence by means of signs and interpretants have the power to interpret signs. Thus a sign only harbours a potential meaning - it cannot be pinned down to a definite meaning. Put yet another way, every semiosis is the scene of real po- tency, of interactive powers conducive to various interpretations. Briefly, then, the interpretive dimension of semiosis indicates that the power to make meanings belongs as much to interpretants as to the signs. The upshot is that Peirce's principled denial that semiosis is dyadic, and his ac- knowledgment of an interpretative dimension in every semiosis, points to the existence of a primordial imaginative activity. In so far as interpretants have the power to make interpretations, they have a capacity to make 'internal' decisions in respect to the potential significance of 'external' signs. In other words, 'matter' possesses intrinsic creative powers, at least wherever and whenever in- terpretations are not completely determined. Hence there must be an element of self-determination, and thus an imaginative activity, inherent in world- semiosis. Thus Peirce's and Whitehead's insights converge in a thoroughly evolu- tionary interpretation of "the raw universe" in which communicative habits keep the incipient anarchy of creative imagination in check. One of the chief</page><page sequence="18">715 Murray Code limitations of the materialistic view is overcome, since it is unable to deal with emergence which generally refers to the specific ways in which the creativity inherent in the world becomes qualified in the particular forms of order mani- fested by its organic creatures. And some of the wisdom in the original mean- ing of organization is recovered, for this term applies not only to individual cells and their enveloping organs but also to the living 'bodies' of whole cul- tures and indeed to the whole world, just as the premoderns believed. A qualifi- cation is necessary, however, in order to take into account the 'deadness' of what Whitehead calls "material societies," like stones, etc., where an overarch- ing principle of order is missing and statistical averages predominate. For order is essentially a social product: there can be no order without some nexus of in- dividuals in more or less stable and meaningful communicative relationships.39 At this point, the question whether there is meaning in "the raw universe" can now be delicately raised. For it is small wonder that the topic of meaning is so controversial and shunned by modern (and even post-modern) philosophers who have been weaned in a climate of repression of imagination and who are consequently inclined to treat ontology and epistemology as if they were two distinct domains of philosophical inquiry. Even to begin to tackle the question of whether there is meaning in the world is immediately to become enmeshed in the imaginative give and take between possibility and actuality. It is probably fatal for understanding meaning, or anything else for that matter, to allow one- self to be pulled too far to one or the other side. That a conjoined Whiteheadian-Peircean metaphysical imaginary is espe- cially suited to maintaining a balanced approach to the problematic of meaning is partly indicated by Peirce's answer to the question of what actually is com- municated in a primitive semiosis. This can only be a certain possibility, or complex of possibilities. Signs are the sine qua non for conveying messages, yet there is no such thing as a message that does not presuppose a receiver capable of responding to it. Peirce describes an interpretant as "the first proper signifi- cate effect of a sign" and this, he says, is "a feeling produced by it" (CP, 5.475). He thereby links the interpretation of a sign qua possibility (or mere potentiality) to a peculiar quality of feeling - that is, to what is simply felt. In other words, whenever a certain sign is entertained as a 'something' that may possibly be significant, its first meaning-effect (if it has any effect at all) is the feeling of a certain quality.40 Thus the triadicity of sign-action ultimately re- quires an embodied, sympathetic interpreter actually capable of responding to and feeling the peculiar qualities of signs. Whitehead's description of his theory of organism as a "cell theory of actu- ality" is therefore particularly apt. A cell is first and foremost a body and with- out bodies there can be no feeling of feelings. This elementary observation ac- cords with Peirce's assignment of feelings to the metaphysical category of Firstness. That is to say, the peculiar feeling associated with a sign-quality, or possibility, is, as he insists, simply sui generis*1 But if this is so, the connectivi-</page><page sequence="19">Interpreting the The Raw Universe' 716 ties manifested in a world perfused with signs must be inherently affective in nature, an idea that Whitehead makes explicit in his interpretation of causality as sympathetic responses to feelings felt by others. For in so far as causality is relevant to the analysis of order, it is always secondary to affective considera- tions that pertain to the potentiality of signs to convey^ rather than determine, meanings. But it is important to stress that feelings can only be 'conveyed' indirectly; that is, through the transmission of signs: it makes no sense to speak of an ac- tual transmission of feelings. There can only be reenactments of feelings by (organic embodied) interpreters of signs. As the metaphor of habit reminds us, coherent reenactments of feelings are conditioned, often automatic, responses to 'external' influences. Such repetitions are not mechanical, however, since 'internal' responses can evolve new ways of being through an imaginative en- tertainment of new possibilities for feeling. Peirce's insight that the entire uni- verse is perfused with signs thus leads (after a few Whiteheadian leaps of imagi- nation) to the view that the order of nature exemplifies a principle of creativity that exists in constant tension with the inertia of habits. Life and death are, in a word, locked in an unbreakable embrace. Or better perhaps, dance, for White- head's frequent references to "the creative advance of nature" need qualifica- tion since imagination appears to be as conducive to evil as to good. The over- all picture is at any rate consonant with the image of Process as an only more or less harmonious dance led by the mythopoeic figure of Eros - a plurality of societies of societies, sometimes co-operating, sometimes competing, but inex- tricably enmeshed in a working out of a cosmic desire. As for the satisfaction envisaged by such a desire, this can perhaps only emerge during the dance, since there appears to be no sense to 'before' or 'after' the dance. If there is a point to this restless activity it must be found in the deepening and strengthen- ing of the broad range, varieties, and intensities of organic experiencings. Such experiencings testify to a universal appetite for life, or meaning-making, which is lured ever onward by the possibility of new, hitherto unrealized ways of be- coming-being.43 V. Conclusion: Where Is Fancy Bred the Least? This crucial question, I suggested at the outset, lies at the heart of every rationalistic story about this world. It cannot be answered without at the same time raising the question of the adequacy of one's chosen (or silently adopted) metaphysical imaginary. If you happen to feel that certain accounts of 'the raw universe' (such as those proffered by contemporary cosmologists or neo- Darwinian naturalists) are inadequate, perhaps even inimical to a healthy un- derstanding of the world, you may actually be right. But there is no definitive rebuttal for the standard objection that feelings are notoriously untrustworthy guides to good judgement. Whatever 'rightness' I attach to my own, it can be objected, merely reflects my personal preference for a certain organicistic</page><page sequence="20">717 Murray Code imaginary. For have I not argued that reason can only ever move inside some chosen imaginary? I have also argued that the degree of Tightness of one's preferred imaginary ultimately depends on the quality of the imaginative insights that it incarnates. But since feelings of Tightness are implied by the very idea of an insight, this circumstance only confirms that feelings are 'first' in both choosing and evalu- ating metaphysical imaginaries. Either one feels the need for a metaphysical imaginary that acknowledges the primacy of feelings or one doesn't. Yet if it is granted that feelings (or their more complicated offsprings, emotions) are among the most concrete and undeniable facts of experience, the imaginary I have sketched can at least claim to have passed a major test of adequacy. Unless feelings are included in the warp of a metaphysical imaginary, it is hard to see how they can be woven in later, let alone deduced from a set of mathematical abstractions. The absurdity of a deduction of desire is evident in the interpretive dimen- sion of rationalistic story-telling, assuming that serious inquiry begins and ends with a desire to get something right. But as the example of Kant shows, to sat- isfy such a desire requires a prior, happy choice of fundamental guiding im- agery, an activity that is inescapably uncertain and unscientific since it must be made under the guidance of 'hybridized' feelings of rightness. The adjective is necessary in the light of the imaginary I have sketched because pure feelings belong, if they exist at all, to the most primitive level of individual prehensions of pure possibilities. But if the constitution of order in the world is indeed so- cial, it is doubtful whether organisms, except perhaps the absolutely primitive (assuming there are any), have unmediated access to pure possibilities. To attempt to articulate an adequate imaginary is thus to strive for a 'right- enough' metaphorics that will, it can only be hoped, help speed the recovery from modernist tendencies to divide the world into conscious mentality on the one hand and insentient or 'dead' matter on the other. With the metaphysical stage thus set for a philosophy of nature-culture(s) capable of doing justice to both concrete experience and scientific achievements, not to mention the in- sights of 'other' cultures (which in the West tend to be dismissed as 'lesser') there is some hope of countering predominant nihilistic interpretations of the world. But in order to get behind the deliverances of sense experience to deeper meanings, it is necessary to strike a delicate balance between a host of competing factors - a feat that requires a minimum of interferences from dis- tracting or disruptive emotional conflicts. Hence the aptness of Whitehead's definition of philosophical understanding: when thought has done its best, what results is not a final and complete solution to specific problems but rather "some grasp of the immensity of things, some purification of emotion by un- derstanding."44 As everyday existence constantly reminds us, emotional con- flicts are unavoidable, so there is probably nothing more valuable to would-be rational inquirers than a broad training in a whole spectrum of imaginative in-</page><page sequence="21">Interpreting the The Raw Universe' 718 quiry ranging from mathematics through metaphysics to poetry. Except for trivial cases, to perform in philosophy what Dillard calls the "trick of reason"45 elicits such a range of competing interests, extending from private insights to public imperatives (many of which belong to the order of myths) that it is unreasonable to ask for explicit criteria for promising meta- physical imaginaries. My final claim for the anthropomorphic imaginary I have sketched is therefore of the order of a promise. It ¿possible to imagine a much better fit than we now have between the meanings established in dominant in- terpretations of the natural and the meanings that "the raw universe" provides in potentia. It is even possible to restore to nature, long since eviscerated by nihilistic materialist imaginaries, its own 'insides'. Hence Dillard need not worry that one of her pet notions - that "imaginative acts carry real weight in the universe" - is "a crackpot notion" (LF, 173-75). This idea is just what is needed to advance understanding of the intimate connection between knowers and known, and between cultures and natures. It is an idea that, as Dillard says, gives the artist "real work." And the philosopher too, I would add. University of Guelph NOTES 1 .

Peirce can also be read as upholding the importance of metaphor in metaphysics. He remarks, for instance, that "if metaphor be taken literally to mean an expression of a similitude when the sign of predication is employed instead of the sign of likeness - as when we say this man is a fox instead of this man is like a fox, - I deny entirely that metaphysicians are given to metaphor; on the contrary, no other writers can compare with them for precision of language; but if ... metaphor [means a] broad comparison on the ground of characters of a formal and highly abstract kind, - then, indeed, metaphysics professes to be metaphor..."

References to the Collected Papers will be given in the usual manner; thus: CP 8.125. 1 shall argue below that if the notion of sign is treated as a key philosophical metaphor, it is a natural complement to Whitehead's metaphor of organism. 27. Kant explicitly endorses in his first Critique a coercive (Baconian) interpretation of reason. In the Preface to the second edition he maintains that reason needs to take the lead in the study of nature "with principles of judgment based upon</page><page sequence="24">721 Murray Code fixed laws, constraining nature to give answers to questions of reason's own determining.... [thus acting like] an appointed judge who compels witnesses to answer questions which he himself formulated" (CPR, 20). 28. As reported by A. H. Johnson, Whitehead and His Philosophy (New York: University Press of America, 1983), p. 6 from a lecture in which Whitehead stresses the need to return to Descartes to begin a new kind of analysis of experience by looking at life in all its stages. 29. The intimate relation between generality and vagueness is implicit in Peirce's description of these characteristics of signs as "antithetical analogues" (CP, 5.506). I explore this idea in Chapter 6 of Myths of Reason. 30. CP 7.220. 31. The relevance of Coleridge (who Whitehead unaccountably brushes aside) to this discussion cannot, for reasons of space, be pursued further, except to note that he upholds a "law of polarity" which "reigns through all Nature," a 'law' which proclaims that nature is the manifestation of a dynamic "living and generative inter- penetration" of opposite forces. See, e.g., Owen Barfield, What Coleridge Thought (Middletown, Conn.: Wesleyan University Press, 1971), esp. Chapter 3. 32. See Chapter 1 of Process and Reality: An Essay in Cosmology, corrected edition, ed. David Ray Griffin and Donald W. Sherburne (New York: The Free Press, 1978), hereafter referred to as PR, and my Myths of Reason, esp. Chapter 4.. 33. Cf. Johnson (op. cit., 15 Iff.) who maintains that Whitehead's categories are based on the general structure of experience, but that the categoreal structure itself is not the central part of his philosophy. Indeed, Johnson explicitly describes his account of Whitehead as an attempt to correct a crucial general error, "the widespread neglect of the fact that the basis of Whitehead's philosophy is a series of insights (intuitions)..." (p. ix). Likewise, although Peirce is often read as lending support to modern Anglo-American analytic philosophy, I believe he is more profitably read as an astute and insightful adventurer in the realm of ideas, and therefore an ideal companion for Whitehead. 34. For a detailed account of the historico-philosophical background of the problematic of matter, see Ivor Ledere ( The Philosophy of Nature, Washington, D.C.: The Catholic University Press of America, 1986). Arguing for the need for a revived philosophy of nature, Ledere recounts how the philosophy of the modern era came to completely reject the Aristotelian idea of ousia, or natural being, as one integral whole (e.g. a human being, animal, or plant). But while modern thought tends to view physical existents as compounds reducible to certain primary or elementary constituents, developments in 20th century physics increasingly support the Aristotelian view, that compounds are actual entities in their own right in so far as they can sustain a character (see esp. Chapter 9). Moreover, if physical entities are "essentially active," this entails a principle of relativity since "these entities are necessarily by their acting in relation with one another" (ibid., 141, my italics). 35. A Kantian influence is evident in Whitehead's remark that "consciousness is what arises in some process of synthesis of physical and mental operations," or again, "consciousness arises when a synthetic feeling integrates physical and conceptual feelings" (PR, 242-43). 36. "A simple physical feeling," says Whitehead, "is the most primitive type of an act of perception, devoid of consciousness" (PR, 236). 37. Whitehead suggests an indispensable imaginative dimension to</page><page sequence="25">Interpreting the "The Raw Universe' 722 generic 'minding' when he observes that the "germ of mind" is "the lure for feeling" where "the how of feeling, though it is germane to the data, is not fully determined by the data" (PR, 85). 38. Peirce puts his finger on a major weakness of mechanistic imaginaries that stress the immutability of universal laws of nature when he notes that "it is not of the nature of uniformity to originate variation, nor of law to beget circumstance" (CP, 6.553). 39. "This doctrine, that order is a social product, appears in modern science as the statistical theory of the laws of nature ..." (PR, 92). 40. Cf. CP 5.289: "...as something present, feelings are all alike and require no explanation, since they contain only what is universal." 41. Cf. CP, 6.201: "Whatever is First is ipso facto sentient," where the category of First refers to that which is or exists independent of anything else (CP, 6.32). 42. Stressing that qualities or possibilities must be taken just as seriously as the particulars they qualify, both Peirce and Whitehead insist on the reality of some possibilities. Peirce also usefully distinguishes between reality and existence, reserving 'existence' for what is capable of acting and being acted upon and 'reality' for generals, or possibilities, which he calls "cognitionary entities." 43. Not even God, who is an actual entity in Whitehead's philosophy, is free from 'appetite': "appetition is immediate matter of fact including in itself a principle of unrest, involving realization of what is not and may be" (PR, 32). This idea appears to have close affinities with Peirce's notion of "evolutionary love" - see, e.g., CP 6.287-317 where Peirce distinguishes three kinds of evolution: evolution by fortuitous variation, evolution by mechanical necessity, and evolution by creative love. The last kind he calls agapism, in which "advance takes place by virtue of a positive sympathy among the created springing from continuity of mind" (CP 6.304). 44. Modes of Thought, 168-69. 45. "The trick of reason is to get the imagination to seize the actual world - if only from time to time." Annie Dillard, An American Childhood (New York: Harper &amp; Row Pub. Inc., 1987), 19.</page></plain_text>
