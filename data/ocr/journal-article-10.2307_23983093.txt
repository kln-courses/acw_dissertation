Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 2001. Simon Jarvis: Adorno: A Critical Introduction. New York: Routledge, 1998). Shierry Weber Nicholsen: Exact Imagination, Late Work: On Adomo's Aesthetics. Cambridge: MIT P, 1999. Introduction The three volumes that this review essay comprises mark some of the most in teresting and lucid work in recent Adorno scholarship. For those seeking an introduction to Adorno's work, of the group, Jarvis's volume Adorno fulfills this function best, proving as useful for the newcomer as it is for the Adorno scholar. The other two volumes take up discrete elements of Adorno's think ing. Bernstein's Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics is the first study in Adorno scholarship devoted exclusively to the topic of ethics in his writings. Nicholsen's Exact Imagination, Late Work explores Adorno's aesthetics, which his works both explicitly address in their content and implicitly stage in their form. When seeking an introduction to Adorno, a number of very cogent intro ductions come to mind: Gillian Rose's The Melancholy Science: An Introduc tion to the Thought of Theodor W. Adorno (1978); Martin Jay's Adorno (1984); and Fredric Jameson's Late Marxism: Adorno, or, The Persistence of the Dialectics (1990). Yet over a decade has elapsed since the last of these stud ies. Jarvis's study Adorno: A Critical Introduction aims «to explain why Adorno's work still matters today» (1). Although Adorno's writings address an astonishing variety of disciplines - philosophy and sociology, psychology and social research, aesthetics, literary and music criticism, the philosophy and sociology of music - there is a re markable inner coherence to his thought. For example, he consistently at tends to systems of power, while scrutinizing the details of aesthetics - punc</page><page sequence="2">164 Christina Gerhardt tuation and syntax in poetry, the use of foreign words in essays, the structure of a musical composition. For Adorno, aesthetic objects are ciphers of human experience. In other words, not only the explicit statement of the sentence gives us meaning, but also the very form. Therefore, bypassing some aspect of his work - for example, his negotiation with Hegelian idealism - might make it difficult to understand apparently unrelated aspects of his work, such as so cial theory or music criticism. Jarvis opens his study of Adorno by introducing Adorno's key concepts - e.g. immanent critique, Utopian negativity, metacritique, instrumental reason, the double character of language, negative dialectic and the truth content of art - and the point at which they entered Adorno's thought. This movement simultaneously introduces Adorno's writings and their primary concerns, and places them into a historical and biographical context. Adorno's Critical Theory of Society Against this background, Jarvis presents Adorno's critical theory of society, examining Dialectic of Enlightenment and Adorno's sociological criticism. It makes a certain amount sense to use Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment as an introduction to Adorno's thinking. Bernstein does the same in his volume. Dialectic of Enlightenment simultaneously contains a po litical, an economic, a literary, a sociological, and a philosophical critique. It is also more accessible than some of Adorno's other works that span a similar array of disciplines. And it sits at an important transition in Adorno's think ing: its argument contains much that comes out of his early lectures on philos ophy, and points in the direction of preoccupations that re-appear in his two long late works Negative Dialectics and Aesthetic Theory. Lastly, the work was written from the standpoint of exile. As it moves from Homer's Odyssey to De Sade's Juliette, touching on the culture industry and winding up at an analysis of anti-Semitism, it pinpoints the treacherous and nefarious conse quences of an allegedly enlightened thinking, which rests on a less than en lightened attempt to suppress and eradicate perceived difference. Showing the relationship between the political and economic thinking of Adorno and a number of his contemporaries and precursors, Jarvis examines Adorno's critical theory of society. Jarvis locates Adorno somewhere be tween the stance of Weber and of Dürkheim. According to Jarvis, «Weber ar gued that social institutions and processes had to be understood through the subjective self-understanding of individuals participating in them, without whom these processes would be nothing at all» (45). Inversely, Dürkheim fo</page><page sequence="3">Review Essay 165 cused more on the historical phenomena and neglected the individuals that made them happen: «The merit of his approach is that it testifies to the real preponderance of petrified social relations over individuals» (46). Somewhere between the subject-focused and the historically or object-focused approach, Jarvis argues, lies Adorno's preferred method. Jarvis then considers Marx's political economy, bringing Adorno's concept of the non-identity of identity together with the section of Marx's Capital en titled «The Fetishism of the Commodity and its Secret.» Marx's theory of commodity exchange builds on Hegel's theory of the non-identity of identity put forth in his Logic, but shifts the emphasis. Exchange value, Marx argues, comes to appear as though it were not the result of human labor, but an inher ent property of the commodity itself. This displacement, whereby power is instilled in an inanimate object that it does not inherently have, Marx called commodity fetishism. It bears affinity to the identification and misidentifica tion in Hegel's theory of the non-identity of identity. Marx lingers on the economic consequences, paying less attention to the social, cultural and intel lectual consequences. Lukacs addresses these consequences in his chapter on «Reification and the Consciousness of the Proletariat» in History and Class Consciousness. As Su san Buck-Morss has argued elsewhere, the problem with Lukacs's account, which claimed that the proletariat was «entrusted by history», is that it sug gested a progressive account of history. As Jarvis states, «In Adorno's work, by contrast, the revolutionary consciousness of the proletariat has no special epistemological status. This is not simply because Adorno's assessment of the chances for successful proletarian revolution is less optimistic than Lukacs's but, more fundamentally, because of his doubts about granting a privileged epistemological role to any kind of practice» (54). Jarvis closes this chapter on Adorno's critical theory of society with the ques tion «What can a social theory, which is so closely if complicatedly related to Marx, have to tell us today?» (67). Perhaps surprisingly for some, Jarvis refers to Derrida's Specters of Marx here, and particularly to the distinction Derrida makes in this work between the living and the non-living. In this Jarvis sees an affinity to Adorno's work and furthermore to Marx's - all three, he argues, are invested in understanding the human's socio-economic predicament as one that takes her relationship to her life away from her. «The more thoroughly devel oped the means of production and its associated division of labour, the less liv ing labour can set its own goals: the less, indeed, living labour is living» (71). In essence, the modern division of labor renders the laborer lifeless. Adorno's cultural critique also sheds light on his societal critique. Jarvis opens the chapter, appropriately enough, with a discussion of Adorno's al</page><page sequence="4">166 Christina Gerhardt leged cultural elitism. Although Adorno's dismissive statements about popu lar culture have often been discussed, Jarvis argues that his stance vis-à-vis high culture is similar. That is, it is not necessarily the artwork itself that has diminished, but our relationship to it. Generally, our relationship to art is rather repetitive and mechanical. We relate to art the way that we relate to work: in the technological era, our participation in either is mechanical and therefore distanced. Here, Jarvis makes his argument drawing on Benjamin's artwork essay. Bernstein, too, claims that our experience of the artwork itself has dimin ished. He argues that «Erfahrung» is withering into «Erlebnis.» He states that «Erlebnis» means to have or to live through the experience, and «Erfahrung» «is the cognitive mode through which we have that apprehension of unique ness» (113) or the weight of an experience. Modernist art provides us with the experience of the withering of experience, of a world without experience. Adorno characterizes how this plays itself out in Proust as follows: «Undam aged experience is produced only in memory, far beyond immediacy [...] To tal remembrance is the response to total transience, and hope lies only in the strength to become aware of transience and preserve it in writing» (Notes to Literature 317). And according to Benjamin, experience is destroyed in modernity for the following reasons: «For never has experience been contradicted more thoroughly than strategic experience by tactical warfare, economic experience by inflation, moral experience by those in power» (Illu minations 84). For Bernstein, the withering of experience is part of the disen chantment of nature and the rationalization of reason. Adorno's Aesthetic Theory The second part of Jarvis's volume focuses on aesthetics. Jarvis examines, first, Kant's Critique of Judgment and then Hegel's Aesthetics. Certainly, they are the most pivotal works on which Adorno theory of aesthetics rests. However, as Jarvis states in the introduction, Adorno's works, particularly his major late two works, Negative Dialectics and Aesthetic Theory «have not always been well understood in the Anglophone world. This is partly because of the inadequacy of the existing translating [...]. But it is also because of the relative unfamiliarity, especially amongst social theorists, musicologists and literary critics - but also even amongst philosophers - of the tradition of clas sical German philosophy whose language and idiom forms the very element of Adorno's thought. Unfortunately, there is no short-cut through this ob stacle. To introduce Adorno's thought is also to introduce the philosophical</page><page sequence="5">Review Essay 167 tradition in which he writes» (17). Certainly, there is some truth to this asser tion. Jarvis does not shy away from the German philosophical tradition that he mentions here, when presenting Adorno's work. As we shall see below, Nicholsen has a radically different approach to Adorno's aesthetics. Jarvis's discussion of Adorno's aesthetic theory draws on Kant's third critique, the Critique ofJudgment. Pivotal to Kant's critique of judgment is, according to Jarvis, «the suspension of a bad choice between empiricist and rationalist aesthetics. Rationalist aesthetics presents beauty as though it were a quality of the object itself [...] without any reference to subjective experi ence. [...] Yet equally, against empiricist theories of taste, he insists that beau ty is not reducible to subjective gratification» (93). There has been much de bate about whether or not Kant's critique of judgment and his theory of aesthetics is subjectivist. Yet as Jarvis explains, «Adorno recognizes that it is not sufficient to complain that Kant's aesthetics is subjectivist» (95). In fact, according to Adorno, «Kant would like, analogously to the critique of rea son, to ground aesthetic objectivity through the subject, not to replace the former with the latter» (Aesthetic Theory 245). But Jarvis continues, «None the less, the fact that Kant considers works of art only in relation to the con templating or producing subject leaves him unable to interpret the cognitive element in works of art themselves» (96-7). The relationship between the subject and art, then, becomes central to Adorno's engagement with aes thetics. It is also the focal point of Nicholsen's analysis, Exact Imagination, Late Work on Adorno's Aesthetics, whose term «exact imagination» marks precisely the conjunction of knowledge, subjective experience and aesthetic form. Jarvis proceeds with his analysis of Hegel's aesthetics. Hegel is interested in Kant's Critique of Judgment «because of the way in which, he thinks, it at tempts to reconcile some of the governing oppositions of Kant's thought: be tween freedom and nature, spontaneity and receptivity, the noumenal and the phenomenal» (98). These reconciliations are, according to Hegel, unsuccess ful because they are not fully carried through. Hegel also attempts to over come Kant's failure to reconcile subject and object: «Yet Adorno believes that Hegel's subject-object is, in aesthetics as elsewhere, a disguised subject; that is, that Hegel's aesthetics remains idealist. Adorno attempts to provide a ma terialist critique of this idealist aesthetics. Adorno wishes [...] to articulate a priority of the object in art» (99). For this reason, in Aesthetic Theory Adorno works out and proposes a theory of the primacy of the object. According to Jarvis: «Many of the central features of Adorno's aesthetics, then, are already present in Hegel's thought: an insistence on the cognitive element of works of art; a refusal to resign the historicality of works of art to an extra-philosophi</page><page sequence="6">168 Christina. Gerhardt cal realm of contingency; a criticism of subjectivist theories of art and aesthet ic experience» (99). Nicholsen's study Exact Imagination: Late Work on Adorno's Aesthetics focuses specifically on aesthetics but has a very different approach. Not only does she not take recourse to Kant and Hegel, she also focuses explicitly on the relationship between subjective experience and aesthetic form. For while Adorno offers «a criticism of subjectivist theories of art and aesthetic experi ence» as Jarvis points out, Adorno does not argue that one should do away with an analysis of it in favor of the primacy of the object. In fact, it would be impossible to do so. The two terms are interdependent. The primacy of the object [Vorrang des Objekts] offers an alternative to the dominating, system atizing rationality that is the counterpart of an administered world. But in or der to understand the aesthetics of Adorno's work and how the primacy of the object is to achieve its goal, we must focus on the role for the subject and sub jective experience. In other words, Adorno wants to the use the subject to dis pel the illusion of constitutive subjectivity {Negative Dialectics xx). Therefore, Nicholsen's study, perhaps surprisingly, returns our attention to the subject. The title term of her volume, «exact imagination» [exakte Phantasie], she tells us, spans the whole of Adorno's oeuvre, from the very early to the very late work. When it first appears in the «The Actuality of Philosophy», it des ignates aconceptual or nondiscursive rationality. It also appears in Adorno's late work, a radio talk of 1965 entitled «Schöne Stellen» and justifies the pri macy of attention given to detail. Here, Adorno argues that one must be able to experience and interpret music from the details to the whole as well as from the whole to the details. Because «exact imagination» spans the philosophical and the aesthetic, the dimension of form and the dimension of experience, Nicholsen turns to it as the guiding principle for her study. It shows that the primacy of the object is inseparable from the reliance on genuine subjective experience, and that configuration is an activity of the subject as well as a fea ture of form. Nicholsen's acute ability to recognize the imbrication of Adorno's aesthet ics and politics, and the inseparability of his form from its argument makes her work welcome. As she herself points out early on, one must look at Adorno's work stereoscopically, focusing at times on Adorno's conceptual statement and at times on the figurative language. One must examine what Adorno says about language, experience and textual form, while simultane ously keeping an eye on his writing, on what he actually does in his writing. As Adorno indicates in his «The Essay as Form,» in the kind of configura tional presentation he is concerned with, the rhetorical elements - the «acon ceptual transitions» of rhetoric with their verbal ambiguities and equivoca</page><page sequence="7">Review Essay 169 tions - become a primary carrier of the presentation and are thus fused with the truth content. Cross-referencing is one of the central formal qualities of Adorno's work. Nicholsen explicitly takes up this topic and the challenges it presents in dis cussing Adorno's work. (Most Adorno critics feel the need to address this is sue at some point, usually early on in the introduction to their volume.) Quo tations and images from Adorno's work appear and reappear in shifting contexts. It is difficult to avoid repetition. Nicholsen, therefore, suggests thinking of her chapters as a constellation or a group of ideas that reinforce one another, rather than exclusively a linearly progressing argument. The concepts that prove to be central to Adorno's thinking - mimesis, aura, con stellation - emanate from Benjamin's work. Nicholsen opens her discussion of the subjective experience of aesthetics by presenting when and how the subject appears. For Adorno, subjectivity emerges as the correlate of the primacy of the object. However, Nicholsen ar gues that the reception of Adorno has so heavily emphasized the primacy of the object «in such a way as to obscure the nonconstitutive subjectivity - and the emphasis on experience - that is its correlate within Adorno's aesthetic work» (15). Therefore, she first returns to the question of experience, specifi cally aesthetic experience. Aesthetic experience is based on a mimetic activity: «If works of art imitate nothing but themselves, then the only person who can understand them is the one who imitates them» (.Aesthetic Theory 190). In other words, the experience follows the tensions and contours of the work of art. Adorno's term for this form of imitation is, variously, «mitvollziehen,» or «nachvollziehen,» or «nachfahren» (17). This mimetic activity moves between and shapes the dialectic of subjectivi ty and objectivity. «The mimetic activity that moves between these poles is both passive and active, both an immersion and active effort. As such, it is nei ther an activity of sensuous perception nor an activity of logical understand ing but rather a kind of intermediary, quasi-sensuous and quasi-logical activi ty. &lt;Art is the most drastic argument against the epistemological separation of sensuousness and understanding) (AT 260/249)» (18). As Nicholsen points out, the formulation that art is the most drastic argument against the episte mological separation of sensuousness and understanding is clearly Kantian, as are Adorno's formulations of the nature of aesthetic experience generally. Adorno's Aesthetic Theory reframes Kantian and Hegelian aesthetics: Kant provides the experiential structure and Hegel the perspective on the end of art. On the one hand, then, the subject must give itself over in mimetic activity to the work of art. For example, Adorno proposes the concept of immanent</page><page sequence="8">170 Christina Gerhardt critiques, whereby one follows the movement of an argument when offering a critique of it, or the concept of immanent movement. In the essay «Presuppo sitions» Adorno describes the mimetic activity of «Nachfahren» or «Mitwol lzug» as follows: «One does not understand a work of art when one translates it into concepts [...] but rather when one is immersed in its immanent move ment; I should almost say, when it is recomposed by the ear in accordance with its own logic, repainted by the eye, when the linguistic sensorium speaks along with it» (Notes to Literature 97). On the other hand, however, the sub jective response determines the aesthetic experience. In other words, as Nicholsen says, «subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetic experience, then, are completely interdependent» (21). Nicholsen argues that «the correlated terms &lt;exact imagination&gt; and &lt;the speculative ear&gt; [...] indicate how, for Adorno, aesthetic experience is both rigorously determined by the primacy of the object and wholly dependent on a genuine, spontaneous subjective response» (19). The term «exact imagina tion designates the experiencing subject's ability to follow the quasi-logical relationships in the artwork with accuracy and precision» (19), while the «speculative ear», a Kierkegaardian phrase, evokes the associative activity of the subject. Adorno also speaks of a «spontaneous receptivity» (a term he borrows from phenomenology) and of a «productive imagination.» «The subject fantasizes and speculates, producing associations from the subject's own experience, which are then matched against what is perceived of the ob ject. The observer contributes» (20). From this vantage-point, Nicholsen continues by reading through some of Adorno's early, middle and late works, paying careful attention to what they might reveal about what she calls «the historical trajectory of subjectivity in art» (31). Nicholsen defines mimesis in light of the dialectic between subjec tivity and objectivity: Imitation here does not consist of the art work's ability to imitate the «reality» of the world, as Aristotle defined mimesis, but rather consists of the subject's ability to retrace the steps of the artwork, which in volves subjectivity and objectivity. Chapter two considers Adorno's conceptualization of language. It opens with a discussion of Adorno's use of «rauschen.» While earlier works, such as «The Essay as Form» or «On Lyric Poetry and Society,» contain explicit for mulations of Adorno's relationship to language, in Adorno's later works this relationship must be excavated. Nicholsen examines how it appears in Adorno's essay on Borchardt's poetry. Exploring «rauschen», we do come to learn not what it is, but rather what it is not. It is «not human speech [...] nor nature [...] nor communication or meaning» (62). Instead it is «language in its autonomy» (62).</page><page sequence="9">Review Essay 171 Nicholsen then focuses on the name and what it expresses about language. «The coincidence of word and thing in the Name is the impossible ideal that language strives for and fails to attain» (68). However, «since language's movement toward authenticity [...] is premised on and constrained by nega tivity, both as negation and as the inherent dividedness of language» (79), Adorno is drawn to the lacuna, the structure of parataxis, the blank spots. For example, in his essay «Titles» Adorno lingers on the original name Kafka gave his novel Amerika: Der Verschollene, the one who was never heard of, or from, again, calling it the «blank space for a name that cannot be found» (7). As Nicholsen says, «The name that cannot be found is that of the émigré who disappears into the other land - disappears from the memory» (80). Nicholsen also calls to mind Beckett's The Unnamed. The Unnamed and Der Verschollene are in a way the negative foil to the name: they say the un sayable. Music, Nicholsen argues, seems to stand in for this impossible ideal for which language strives. This does not mean that the sensory aspect of music is what is important here. Rather «music and language stand in complementary relationships to that ideal, thus indeed forming part of a constellation, as Adorno's comments on the title Notes to Literature indicate» (70-71). «In deed, the title Notes to Literatur or Noten zur Literatur, which already con tains a reference to music that is much more obvious in the original German where «notes» as in «to take notes» is usually rendered with «Notizen» rather than «Noten» which is reserved for the musical, was originally intended to be Words Without Music, in a play on Mendelssohn's Songs without Words. It refers explicitly to the constellation of words and music&gt;» (70). According to Nicholsen, the difference between music and language is that in music the particulars are placed in a constellular relationship that cannot be subsumed under a larger abstract system. Adorno also analyzes punctuation marks or rhetorical techniques that hinder coherence in language. For example, in his essay on Hölderlin, «Parataxis,» Adorno examines how this rhetorical technique impedes syntac tical subordination. In «Wörter aus der Fremde» and in «Fremdwörter» he uses foreign words as a sign of the non-identity of identity or of alterity in language. In less familiar instances, such as his essay on «Mahler,» Adorno ex amines how isolated notes remain suspended, or in «George» he focuses on George's use of the particle «gar» to create a space of the absurd. As in the previous chapter, Nicholsen clearly and slowly introduces discrete concepts, and then provides close readings of them in Adorno's work. In this chapter on language, Nicholsen lastly examines how Adorno uses his theory of language in his writings about the language of philosophy and</page><page sequence="10">172 Christina Gerhardt criticism, rather than poetic or literary language. She finds these writings bear close affinity to what he argues in his writings about literary language. So, for example, Adorno claims that philosophical terminology cannot claim to be equivalent to historical truth, but instead bears traces of this truth. Hence, historical truths cannot be expressed directly, nor can new words express it. One can only attempt «to place the words around the new truth in such a way that their configuration yields the new truth» (91). Thus, when Adorno ex amines Hegel's philosophy in «Skoteinos, or How to Read Hegel» he under takes an immanent criticism, pulling apart Hegel's philosophy not only in content but also in form, and focusing on the linguistic structure of his argu ment. As Nicholsen reminds us, the title of the essay «Skoteinos», from the Greek word «skoteinos» means obscure. Nicholsen closes this chapter about language with an analysis of how Adorno uses these techniques in his own writing. In the third chapter, Nicholsen discusses Adorno's Aesthetic Theory, which, at the time of her writing, had just recently appeared in its new transla tion by Robert Hullot-Kentor. Nicholsen hopes to «shed light on the way its form has helped to make it difficult of access» (103). The very form of Aes thetic Theory highlights Adorno's claim that form is inseparable from its sub stance. The book thus poses the question of the relation between philosophy and art, reason and the aesthetic. As Adorno himself said, the Aesthetic Theo ry was written «concentrically [...] in paratactic parts of equal weight arranged around a central point.» Useful for understanding the configura tional form of Aesthetic Theory, Nicholsen argues, is to compare its form to the form of his more accessible «aesthetic essays,» «meaning the essays whose subject matter is itself aesthetic: works of literature, art, or music» (105). She focuses in particular on «The Essay as Form» and «Titles.» Nicholsen argues that «in &lt;The Essay as Form,&gt; the structure of subjective aesthetic experience is reformulated in terms of the relationships among word, concept and object» (108). These fit together in a way that is not illogi cal, but which is also not discursive. Transitions are loose and some concepts are not subordinated to others. «In this combination of loose development and static, imagelike quality, the essay's mode of development is more akin to rhetoric [...] than to logic with its strict forward progression» (109). Not only does the configurational structure thwart logic, it also alters the relationship of subject and object. «In orienting itself toward the free play of the subject's faculties in the perception of the internal dynamics of the object, the essay redirects both logic and rhetoric away from power and domination» (109). And in this way, what happens at the level of language is akin to what Adorno argued for about the artwork: «The aconceptual thinking of particulars ere</page><page sequence="11">Review Essay 173 ates a unique amalgam of subject and object, the conceptual and the aconcep tual, which resembles the artwork in its autonomy but nevertheless puts forth a claim to truth through its use of the medium of concepts» (110). In Nicholsen's work, which is in some ways also structured as a constellation, her major concern reemerges periodically: the subject and object are interde pendent Lastly, Nicholsen, like Jarvis, notices the relevance of natural beauty, which has been overlooked, for Adorno's aesthetic theory. Adorno argues that «art does not imitate nature, nor even individual natural beauty, but rather natural beauty as such» (113). The concept of natural beauty as it ap pears in Adorno's Aesthetic Theory is relevant to Nicholsen's concern with the relationship between the primacy of the object and subjective experience as well: «Natural beauty testifies to the primacy of the object in subjective ex perience» (111). As Nicholsen notes in a footnote: «it may well be that Adorno's aesthetics will prove influential in the developing field of environ mental aesthetics» (242, fn 13). Jarvis, too, examines the concept of natural beauty in his discussion of aes thetics: «For Hegel natural beauty was the lowest and least significant form of aesthetic experience, and his aesthetics moves quickly past it to the beautiful in art. Adorno reads Hegel's premature dismissal of natural beauty as symp tomatic of the idealism latent in Hegel's aesthetics» (99). By privileging cul tural beauty over natural beauty, Hegel inadvertently repeats the mistakes of idealism that he'd sought to avoid.1 That is, natural beauty is of less signifi cance for Hegel than the beautiful in art because it is less thoroughly mediated by spirit. According to Jarvis, «This account of natural beauty is not taken to be a simple mistake on Hegel's part. It registers a historical truth: the intensi fication of the domination of nature discussed in the Dialectic of Enlighten ment» (99). Hegel's premature dismissal of nature falls into a larger paradigm, accord ing to Adorno, one that he had been mulling over as early as his 1932 lecture «On the Idea of Natural History» and had elaborated and worked out as the basis of his and Horkheimer's critique in the Dialectic of Enlightenment. The attempted repression of nature in its various guises has damaging conse quences. In Negative Dialectics, Adorno points out that the dismissal of nat ural history in favor of human history attempts to smooth over an antago nism in history that cannot be done away with. In Aesthetic Theory, the attempt to dismiss natural beauty in favor of cultural beauty also shows traces of latent idealism in Hegel's thinking. The relationship between natural beau ty and cultural beauty bespeaks problems about mimesis. In chapter four of her study, Nicholsen focuses attention on the concept of</page><page sequence="12">174 Christina Gerhardt mimesis in Aesthetic Theory and brings it into conversation with Benjamin's work on mimesis. Benjamin addresses mimesis explicitly in «On the Mimetic Faculty» and its earlier version «Doctrine of the Similar,» both of which date from the 1930s. Nicholsen argues that Adorno, like Benjamin, «thinks of mimesis as an assimilation of the self to the other, thus a kind of enactment - mimetic behavior» (147). What concerns Nicholsen in mimesis is, on the one hand, its implications for language (152), and, on the other hand, how it ad dresses the relationship between subject and object. This transpires through an analysis of the role of the enigmatic and of the flash in Benjamin's writings. In the final chapter of her work, Nicholsen examines the debate between Adorno and Benjamin, which many critics have chosen to gloss over, by fo cusing on their essays on photography and their relationship to aura. This transpires, to some extent, through a discussion of a photograph of Kafka that Benjamin mentions. Arguing that there are three distinct positions one can invoke when discussing photographs - the position of photographed, of pho tographer, or of viewer of photograph - Nicholsen begins her discussion by remarking on the subtle distinction between the subject position with which Benjamin and Adorno identify photography. While Adorno concentrates on the photographer's stance, Benjamin focuses on the photographed. This has consequences for their subsequent reading of the medium. Adorno's Philosophy Jarvis discusses Adorno's philosophical works in the third part of his book, paying particular attention to Adorno's Negative Dialectics and the notes from Adorno's lecture courses, which have been appearing with pleasing reg ularity and which have inspired a number of interesting works. Here I'm thinking, for example, of Judith Butler's Kritik der ethischen Gewalt [Cri tique of Ethical Violence], a volume that just appeared last summer.2 The point of departure for Butler's study is Adorno's lectures on moral philoso phy, which also just recently appeared in English as Problems of Moral Phi losophy (2000). We are fortunate that these lectures were preserved, for Adorno was notoriously reluctant to have his lectures taped or transcribed. As Rolf Tiedemann says in his afterword to one volume of Adorno's pub lished lectures: «Adorno did not publish any of his lecture courses; and for the most part he refused to allow anyone who had missed a lecture, even close friends or students he knew well, to look at the transcript of the tapes. Adorno's intention in having tapes made was to make use of them subse quently when preparing writings for publication» (Kant's Critique of Pure</page><page sequence="13">Review Essay 175 Reason 282-83). He would not permit their publication during his lifetime. Realizing their value, however, Stanford University Press has published some of the most important, including Problems of Moral Philosophy (2000); Adorno's 1965 lectures on Metaphysics: Concepts and Problems (2001); and his 1959 lectures on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason (2001). The publication of Adorno's lectures in English has sparked new interest in his thoughts on Kant and Hegel, metaphysics, moral philosophy, and ethics. And Jarvis includes them in his analysis of Adorno's philosophical thinking as well. Jarvis is particularly interested in the question of materialism. In the last three chapters, Jarvis «offers an account and a defense of this materialism, drawing both on the most important sources published in Adorno's lifetime - the studies of Hegel, the &lt;metacritique of epistemololgy&gt; and above all, Nega tive Dialectics - but also on those lecture courses so far made available - in particular those on philosophical terminology, on moral philosophy and on epistemology» (148). Jarvis concentrates on how Adorno formulates his thinking as critical thinking without transcendental method, specifically, vis à-vis materialism. As he says, «Adorno's attempt to rethink materialism with out dogmatism addresses nothing other than the problem of &lt;givenness, or to use the Hegelian term, immediacy&gt;, which has proved of such continuing im portance [...] not only for phenomenology, [...] ontology and deconstruc tion, but also for much recent work in analytic philosophy» (148). Here, Jarvis refers to John McDowell's Mind and World. But how does one overcome idealist tendencies? Invoking both the early «The Actuality of Philosophy» essay (1931) and how it is picked up again in Negative Dialectics and other essays, Jarvis points out that, according to Adorno, one cannot simply start anew (151). Not acknowledging tradi tion, or worse, believing that one has overcome tradition as the enlightenment did, would be less than enlightened. Additionally, one cannot simply progress forward blithely asking questions. Instead one has to stop and over come idealist thinking, by reconsidering the types of questions that are intrin sic to it. Therefore, as in the previous section on aesthetics, Jarvis revisits the philos ophy first of Kant and then of Hegel. Drawing on Adorno's lecture notes for the course he taught in 1957/8 on Kant's Critique of Pure Reason, Jarvis ar gues that Adorno revises Kant's notion of experience in two substantive ways. «First, Adorno has argued that experience is both somatic and concep tual [...] not only in the sense that two elements must come together for expe rience to be possible, but also in the sense that these cannot be separated out as &lt;elements&gt; for analysis in isolation from each other. There can be no account of Experience without an account of experiences. Secondly, it has been sug</page><page sequence="14">176 Christina Gerhardt gested that the future of experience cannot be legislated for in the image of its past» (164). Jarvis's analysis of Hegel focuses on his concept of identity thinking, which Hegel presents in his Logic. Identity thinking in Hegel seeks to know its object by the sum total of correct classifications of it. The problem with this thinking for Adorno is that the object can then only say what something comes under. As Adorno says, «Dialectical thinking wants to say what something is, whilst identity thinking wants to say what something falls under, of what it is an ex ample or a representative - and what it therefore is not itself» (Negative Di alectics 152). Adorno's theory of the non-identity of identity relates in compli cates way to a variety of other concerns. Jarvis addresses them in tandem with Marx's theory of commodity fetishism, discussed earlier. While Adorno's the ory reworks strands of philosophy, it also revises our conception of language and our notion of adequation. As Jarvis states, «Dialectical thinking lies not in an attempt to purge thinking of all misidentification, but in the recognition of the insufficiency of any given identification. It is thus not a new and non-iden tificatory kind of thinking, but a demonstration of the insufficiency of identi fication» (167). In other words, dialectical thinking shows up the mutual im plicatedness of concepts and objects, thought and being. Yet as soon as it is wholly given up to thought (method) or to being (world-picture), it is no longer dialectic at all. Therefore, Adorno argues that dialectical thinking can not be regarded either as method or as a world-picture. Jarvis emphasizes that Adorno's appeal to the non-identical is not in simple opposition to Hegel (172); instead Adorno's thought aims from within Hegelian speculation itself. In the subsequent chapter, Jarvis discusses the relationship between Adorno's theory of non-identity and the double character of language, the constellation and mimesis. He does this by taking up the chapter of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason entitled «Schematism of the Pure Concepts» and lat er the section of Adorno's Negative Dialectics entitled «Metacritique of Prac tical Reason,» which focuses on the third antinomy of the Critique of Pure Reason. In Kant's estimation, we could only come to know things as they ap peared to consciousness. But this meant that objects were phenomena rather than things known as they were in themselves (181). For this reason, Adorno shifts the focus to the priority of the object (discussed earlier on with regard to aesthetics.) «Adorno agrees with post-Kantian idealists that it is more con sistent not to separate the thing in itself from the thing as it appears to con sciousness» (182). The idea of a thing as it is in itself bears witness to what Adorno himself has earlier called «the non-identical.» As will be discussed below, Bernstein examines the relationship between Adorno's theory of the non-identity of identity and ethics.</page><page sequence="15">Review Essay 177 Jarvis's final chapter about Adorno's philosophical writings focuses on his studies of Kierkegaard, Husserl and Heidegger in an attempt to understand how Adorno encounters the problem of metaphysics. Adorno's studies of Kierkegaard, Husserl and Heidegger are not only polemical interventions. Their significance lies in their relevance for Adorno's attempt to go beyond transcendental idealism. Jarvis examines Adorno's study of Kierkegaard, fo cusing on the subject; Adorno's study of Husserl, focusing on his anti-psy chologist stance; and his examination of Heidegger, comparing Heidegger's and Adorno's study of Kant's first critique. Jay Bernstein's study, Adorno: Disenchantment and Ethics, is remarkable for a variety of reasons. First, it is the only study in Adorno scholarship devot ed exclusively to the topic of ethics in his writings. Undoubtedly, this is helped by the publication of more of his materials in English, such as his lectures notes Problems of Moral Philosophy. Specifically, Bernstein's study focuses on the moral impulse of this admittedly abstract thinker, whose thoughts are of ten seen as so abstruse that they cannot possibly yield for ethics. Bernstein ar gues the opposite. Bernstein's thesis is that «although Adorno did not produce a work of moral philosophy, his oeuvre has a whole is driven by an ethical vi sion, and hence that in order to do justice to his philosophy it is necessary to disentangle and elaborate the always presupposed ethical contours of his thought» (2). Second, Bernstein, unusually and interestingly, brings Adorno's philosophy into conversation with Anglo-American philosophy. In his introduction, Bernstein lays out clearly some of the guiding princi ples of his argument. Because they determine much of the subsequent study, I quote from a paragraph that lays out central tenets at length: «To demonstrate the centrality of the modes of object-relation that constitute moral insight, Adorno will need to provide an account revealing the primacy of practical reason (moral insight) over theoretical reasoning (scientific insight). Only through so doing can an expanded conception of reason be achieved which would align justifying and motivating reasons. Following Kant, Adorno re gards the basic mental act to be the act of judgment, bringing intuition under concepts. We have already seen that disenchanted reason involves a systemat ic separation between universal and particular and that this separation best explains the diremption between truth conditions and acceptance conditions in ethical reasoning. Adorno avers that despite claims to the contrary, the Kantian distinction between concept and intuition typifies and exemplifies this diremption. Adorno conceives of the Kantian concept, what I term the ideal of the simple concept, as the exemplary product and vehicle of disen chantment» (32). There are a number of revisions that take place here and which will form the focus of Bernstein's work.</page><page sequence="16">178 Christina Gerhardt First, Bernstein lingers on Adorno use of Kant's act of judgment, particu larly as a vehicle of disenchantment. Bernstein tells us: «Disenchantment is demythologization, which is the systematic overcoming of anthropomor phism, the critical negation of projections of the indelibly human onto the world. In practice, the withdrawal from anthropomorphism became equiva lent to freeing reason and concept from their dependence on and submer gence within their &lt;others&gt;: object, image, language, social practice, and histo ry» (33). While an examination of disenchantment is central to Bernstein's study, as he mentioned, what he terms «the simple concept» is its vehicle. The simple concept can be understood as «the concept conceived as wholly inde pendent from its mediations» (33). «Both the ideal of the simple concept and the simple concept itself - the concept conceived as wholly independent from its mediations - are formed through the successful process of demythologiza tion. Because demythologization not only overturns beliefs and eliminates a certain range of objects, but equally destroys the forms which had mediated subject and object, then the disenchantment of nature is at the same time the rationalization of reason. This simple concept is the result of that process of rationalization; it is the bearer and medium of rationalization» (33). Lastly, Bernstein presents the complex concept, which consists of two ax es: a logical and a material axis. Through the logical axis thought identifies dif ferent particulars (individuals or properties of individuals) as belonging to the «same» concept, hence an axis that is equivalent to the ideal of the simple con cept itself. The material axis is composed of the mediating moments of object, image, language and tradition. Adorno argues that the mediations of the ma terial axis are not but mere factual conditions of the concept, but ingredients in it, ingredients, moreover, that do cognitive work. The two axes of the com plex concept are independent of and dependent on one another. In much of what follows, Bernstein lingers on disenchantment, our relationship to na ture, the simple concept, in which the concept is conceived as wholly inde pendent from its mediations and the complex concept, whereby we are re minded of the mediating moment of object, language. Bernstein's study begins with an exposition of Adorno's Minima Moralia both because of its topics and form, in order to lay out Adorno's ethical thought. It consists of 153 aphorisms and fragments, written during Adorno's time in exile. Each fragment offers an objective expression of the subjective experience of ethical life in late modernity. Specifically, Bernstein studies mo ments when Adorno focuses on private life - love, marriage, dwelling - in Minima Moralia and what they reveal about ethical reflection. Bernstein is in terested, too, in the interaction between private and public practices. So, for example, marriage could be measured by what individuals do in marriage,</page><page sequence="17">Review Essay 179 rather than by its relation to divorce, or how it is perceived through structur al inequalities. Or tact, which Adorno discusses in Minima Moralia aphorism 16 and which was religiously, metaphysically, and politically anchored, becomes mainly a form of action and perception. In other words, tact is a form of respecting and acknowledging others in contexts where no determi nate guidelines for respect are available. Bernstein wants to turn to a contem porary formulation of the debate concerning the relative merits of think ing about ethics in terms of ethical life (Sittlichkeit) as opposed to thinking about it in terms of abstract principles of moral rightness (Moralität), which implicitly lies behind the debate between internalism and externalism. Ethical life (Sittlichkeit) would refer to the private life and internalism, while moral rightness (Moralität) would refer to the more abstract morality and external ism. In chapter two, Bernstein explains the conundrum of Minima Moralia in terms of the disenchantment of nature and the rationalization of reason as purveyed in Horkheimer and Adorno's Dialectic of Enlightenment. Both Minima Moralia and Dialectic of Enlightenment were written while Adorno was exile. Historically, three pressures converged to make the search for ra tional foundations for morality necessary and intelligible: the explosive emer gence of natural science, which challenged the belief that ethical predicates could be descriptive (read, cruel); the privilege of reason-giving and theoreti cal justification; and religious, economic, and political individualism. So «dis enchantment (of the natural world), rationalism (the demand for theoretical justification) as the rationalization of reason, and universalism as the flip side of individualism converge to instigate the belief that morality could be sal vaged only by a priori argumentation since, clearly, no socially constituted or factual evidence could be mitigate these characterizations of the world and demands on reflection» (78). Bernstein concludes his chapter with the obser vation that «the relation of reason to authority is directly homologous with the relation of enlightenment to myth; in both cases the second term is de fined negatively, as that which is to be overcome, with the result that both first terms become frozen and deformed» (133). In other words, the attempt by the enlightenment to do away with myth culminates in it becoming myth and the attempt of reason to do away with authority culminates in an exclu sively authoritative reason. The third chapter offers a genealogical reconstruction of Kant's moral phi losophy, since Adorno construes Kantian idealism as the privileged object of philosophical critique. This is vital, since Adorno describes his project in Negative Dialectics as one that will try «by critical self-reflection to give [Kant's] Copernican revolution an axial turn» (ND xx). He also states his in</page><page sequence="18">180 Christina Gerhardt tention «to use the strength of the subject to break through the fallacy of con stitutive subjectivity» (ND xx). In chapter four, Bernstein focuses only on the negative argument of a list of dualisms that Adorno seeks to undo by focusing on the nature-culture dilem ma. (He focuses on the positive in chapter 6.) He states: «his [Adorno's] strat egy, [...] is best conceived through a two-step process. In the first, at a very high level of abstraction, Adorno provides a series of arguments that seek to directly align and interpret, the fundamental features of rationalized reason and its corollaries (constitutive subjectivity, etc.) with the misbegotten and self-defeating attempt to eliminate anthropomorphic nature. In the second step, having thus exposed rationalized reason as fundamentally a self-defeat ing process of abstraction from anthropomorphic nature, he returns to the purely conceptual issue of concept-intuition dualism as a way of attacking that abstraction at its micrological core. Negatively, the project is to demon strate how the rationalized concept indeed encapsulates a drive to indepen dence from the natural world. Positively, the goal is to undo the series of du alisms that constitute concept-intuition dualism» (198). He also argues that «a good deal of the theoretical and rhetorical energy of Dialectic of Enlighten ment derives from Horkheimer and Adorno's belief that the two stages of the argument could be immediately aligned, [...] whereas Negative Dialectics and Aesthetic Theory pursues only the second stage of the argument (199, fn 12). The instantiation of the «negative argument» that Bernstein discusses in chapter four is the self-defeating character of enlightened reason, which it de rives from its disenchantment of the natural world. As he puts it: «Progress involves abstraction from living nature [...] Because living nature is sup pressed in the emergence of rationalized modernity we experience it as dam aging, as hurting. [...] Hence, the whole problem of Adorno's philosophy be comes showing how the two sides of his thought, his account of instrumental or enlightened reason and its opposite (some notion of the complex concept and material inference) and his dependence on some notion of living or ani mal nature fit together» (37). Chapter five begins suturing these two sides of Adorno's thought together, while Bernstein interrogates the status of Adorno's naturalism. In this chap ter, Bernstein has three interrelated concerns that are constitute secular modernity: « 1. no belief (action, norm, etc) can be valid apart from our autho rizing of it [...]; 2. that we must be capable of viewing and comprehending hu man practices as practices of animals of a certain kind who belong to or are parts of the natural world; 3. that we must conceive of significant human val ues, practices, and institutions as emerging historically as the intended or un intended consequence of particular human activities» (236). After examining</page><page sequence="19">Review Essay 181 these concerns, Bernstein closes the chapter with an analysis Adorno's cri tique of Kant's account of freedom, showing that while the first two proposi tions are believed to result from his immanent critique, they are actually pre supposed by it. In chapter six, Bernstein focuses on the complex concept and material in ference. Bernstein contends that reason might emerge as much from «a con ception of ethical reasoning» as it might from «a cognitive awareness of states of affairs» (263). The latter believes that there might contain a moral remain der. In essence then a logical or rationalized reason emerges, and one that is governed by «some concept of material inference structures» (263). Much of the ensuing discussion is tailored to engage Robert Brandom's account of ma terial inference suggested in Making It Explicit. In chapter seven, he explores the complex concept in light of Adorno's the oretical philosophy. For Adorno who examines the world from the vantage point of the complex concept or the object, moral insight does come about as a result of taking up a moral point of view, but as a result «of the conceptual binding of the self to the world überhaupt» (330). However, Bernstein argues that Adorno does not suggest merely an inversion of the relations between self and world. It is, instead, precisely through their interaction or interde pendency that moral insight will come about. Yet the world has also suffered from its disenchantment, such that one can not simply turn to the objects, but must decipher its traces, in other words an absence or a non-identity. In the last two chapters, Bernstein focuses on the concluding section of Negative Dialectics, «Meditations on Metaphysics.» Chapter eight lingers on Adorno's claim that Auschwitz has given us a new categorical imperative: to organize our thoughts so that the like will never happen again. Chapter nine discusses the coldness that Adorno believes is the fallout of enlightened rea son and that characterizes the bourgeois subjectivity. Bernstein contrasts coldness with compassion. If Adorno's insistence that nihilistic despair is not final is correct, it's because we are in possession of what he terms «metaphys ical experience.» The prime example of this, according to Adorno and Bern stein, is modernist art. Conclusion Bernstein's study is a very important contribution to Adorno scholarship, for its focus on ethics and for bringing Adorno into conversation with analytic philosophy. It is the sharp focus of his study on this particular, previously ne glected, aspect of Adorno's writings that makes Bernstein's analysis so</page><page sequence="20">182 Christina Gerhardt worthwhile. Similarly, Nicholsen's study is remarkable: it scrutinizes Ador no's aesthetics through careful close readings of a variety of texts and shifts the emphasis from the object back onto the subject. Interesting about Ni cholsen's study, too, is how her engagement of Benjamin's critical writings and the debate between Adorno and Benjamin. Lastly, Jarvis's introduction lays out Adorno's key concepts, biography and critical works with an incred ible amount of clarity, and yet without oversimplifying or glossing over any of the challenges his work presents in form or content. These three volumes are each a very useful and welcome addition to Adorno scholarship.
