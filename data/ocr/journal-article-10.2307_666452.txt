This book is a timely, thorough, and carefully done re-appraisal of the work of one of the founders of American social science-certainly one of the most original figures which this country has produced. Anthropologists will find much that is useful in Riesman's study of this man, who was profoundly and intimately "Mid-Western" and who had at the same time a lively scholarly and personal interest in the literature and culture of many European countries. He drew heavily on the anthropological literature of his day, and the theoretical synthesis which he produced from the union of these streams of experience and knowledge has still an important role in current anthropological thinking. The beginning student will find Riesman's book a very use- ful introduction to Veblen's work. The mature student will welcome it as an attempt, on the whole successful, to gain new perspective, not only on Veblen, but also-neces- sarily-on ourselves. Riesman begins this work by telling us that it is "not a biography of Veblen, but an interpretation of his work." He relies principally on Veblen's published work and on Dorfman's well-known biography as sources, saying in effect that enough time has passed since Veblen's work to allow us the detachment necessary for an understanding of it as a whole (especially if time is measured in speed of social development). Riesman tells us early (p. xi) that he is no devotee of Veblen. He says, ". . . the call to read Veb len is a call to pleasure, to read him not so much because he has portentous things to say about the modern world but because of the recurrent charm of his intellect, the bite of his sarcasm, the period flavor of his hatreds and affections." For Riesman, Veblen is almost quaint. The book begins with a short psychological biography of Veblen. Riesman finds the structure of Veblen's family, with its strong, "successful," ascetic father, softer, whimsical, imaginative mother, a key to much of Veblen's later interests and imagery. "Like many bright boys, he seems to have been impressed by the male who had the power and authority in his home to give commands, while at the same time developing unexpressed resentments against power and command of any sort." Riesman says that much of Veblen's work may be read as "an internalized colloquy between his parents." He suggests that Veblen's later idealization of the hard-boiled, mechanically adept, no- nonsense engineer is in effect the return of the father-image. He also explores at length the strong schizoid trait in Veblen's personality. Riesman says strongly, however, that Veblen's work cannot be reduced to psychological explanations of this sort. Their real function is to suggest lines of explanation and connection which might otherwise escape us. He tells us suddenly (p. 51) that he cannot push further his speculations into the "tangle" of Veblen's motives, and that the rest of the discussion of Veblen's work will proceed without them. Riesman discusses the bulk of Veblen's work in terms of his concern with a sort of dialectic between the "instinct of workmanship" and the invidious arts of consumption developed by the predatory societies. He finds that the "basic entity" of Veblen's system is the "'instinct of workmanship': an assumed human propensity for activity tailored to the efficient achievement of a goal" (p. 51). It is a great merit of Riesman's book that he so clearly shows the importance of this notion as forming the base-line from which the whole theory of conspicuous waste takes its logical departure. It forms the basis of what anthropologists may find some of the most suggestive pages in Veblen, such as the discussion of anthropomorphism in terms of "the self-contamination of the instinct of workmanship" and the theory of the technological advantage of borrowing</page><page sequence="2">400 American Anthropologist [57, 1955] across ethnic lines. (The borrowed technological device is stripped of all or most of "its anthropomorphic or spiritual virtues and limitations" that have prevented its full use at home.) The last half of Riesman's book is a detailed and quite perceptive consideration of Veblen's doctrine of conspicuous consumption, not so much from a theoretical point of view as from the point of view of life in the mid-twentieth century. He agrees with Veblen that work with machines-and with the social organization of people engaged in machine production-does on the whole tend to make people more rational. He finds, however, that Veblen's picture of the tough-minded, clear-eyed, no-nonsense worker-engineer was romantic: these gentry have now gone in for conspicuous consump- tion in a big way, whereas the rich and the lawyers have read Veblen! Artful casualness and inconspicuous potlatches are now the order of the day, and one must go to Texas or to South America to see "the old splendiferous joy in conspicuous consumption" (p. 184). American emissaries of Point Four and other programs, "no longer welcome at home with their gospel of hard work and industrial progress, compete with Communist intellectuals in bringing Fordism to 'backward' countries. Meanwhile advertising men, sharing Veblen's belief that they belong to the kept classes and Ford's belief that cars aren't built with words, seek to expiate their guilts by government service, work with their hands on their country places, and the use of their media to sell intangible values like tolerance and the American Way" (p. 208). If Riesman finds that the particular meanings which Veblen saw in the various forms of consumption have changed, he by no means implies that the picture has changed in principle. Much of the conspicuous consumption of the present day is dis- placed on to the children. They are sent to ever more gorgeous high-schools and uni- versities, whose underpaid staffs "assure the avoidance of other forms of showier con- sumption . . . by the consumption of therapeutic intangibles . . . If Veblen were around now, his friends would almost certainly, with the best will in the world, urge him to consult a psychoanalyst" (p. 186). The really new and important form of mid-twentieth century emulative waste is, in Riesman's view, "conspicuous production," with the "socialization" of our abundant wealth by corporate display. This takes the form of ultra-fancy factories, with all the latest conveniences, of advertising itself, and finally of armaments. In the mid-twentieth century "by far the most important conspicuous production is that of armaments, in which a jet bomber becomes a symbol of national emulative propensity-and here, indeed, the sky is the limit" (p. 193).
