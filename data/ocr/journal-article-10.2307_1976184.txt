<plain_text><page sequence="1">In Important Thesis Dynamics of Learning, by Nathaniel Cantor. Buffalo, New York: Foster. and Stewart, 1946. x+282 pp. $3.00. If, as Lord Chesterfield wrote, style is the dress of thought, Cantor's is most wondrously arrayed. Thus in a keynote sentence we get a definition of the indi- vidual as "a system of dynamic,. over- lapping 'forces' which actively strive for adjustment to each other and to the en- vironment which affects them" (page 55). Here are brave words, trenchant meta- phor. Is the vigor of the expression matched by the clarity of the thought? What meaning is embodied in the phrase, '"overlapping forces"? Forces do not overlap; they compound. Nor do forces "strive, nor do they " either adjust, to each other, or to anything else. This is arrant anthropomorphism. This reviewer does not object to anthropomorphic expla- nations-of human beings. He does object to anthropomorphizing "forces" ? o even when the term is put in quotation marks. It is persons who strive to adjust, not forces. To personify the activities or "forces" within a person--which is a bas{c error in psychoanalysis also--is to deprive the person of his dignity as an actor and reduce him to a mere stage upon which the hypostasized activities strut. And finally there is that "blessed word," dynamic. May one ask how a dynamic force differs from one which is not dynamic? Or for that matter, how does "active striving" differ from inac- tive striving, if there be such? Here as elsewhere (compare the warning on page 48 against "sterile, impotent, lifeless abstraction"), we seem to have a piling up of vigorous and resounding adjectives, as if to compensate for vagueness of idea by violence of expression. When, however, one digs down into the pile of cliches, stereotyped ideas, and obiter dicta about the sad state of the world, one finds that Cantor has an im- portant, if oversimplified, thesis The chief problem in teaching is that of breaking down the pupils' resistance. "Students want to have their way, and the instructor wants to have his way" (page 86). Only as one gets rid of this resistance does one get "the only kind of genuine education there is: self-criticism, self-discipline, self, motivation, and a willingness to be responsible for one's own 'decisions" (page x). To break this resistance, Cantor offers the method of free discussion with a few trimmings reminiscent of Carl Rogers' non-directive counseling. The instructor must be careful not to initiate discussion,' must understand and accept the some- times thinly veiled hostility of the student, must neither approve nor dis- approve the student's attitude, indeed must avoid critical evaluation. Under such conditions students slowly arrive, we are told, at the point where they can genuinely examine their own prejudices. Certainly, students' resistance to the</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 335 change of ideas may be a serious prob- lem. Some of this resistance may stem, as Cantor says it does, from the rejection of the father image and the revolt against authority. A very great deal of resistance to change comes, however, from the acceptance of authority-other people's authority-and particularly the authority of what "everyone knows." Moreover, the worst resistance to learn- ing or self-change comes from more subtly concealed motives than those of resistance to authority, chiefly from motives of self-protection. (There are, in other words, many things it would be too uncomfortable to know.) Many a dispirited teacher, on the other hand, will be tempted to say that his greatest problem is not the resistance, but the supine submissiveness, of his students. And there are passages where Cantor would seem to agree. This, however, is to minimize the positive value of authority in learning and teaching. Learning is partly a matter of motiva- tion, but, despite Cantor's dictum to the contrary, it is not always, not even usu- ally, self-motivation. Perfectly good motivation can come from outside, from above. Those who hold that such learn- ing is impermanent must explain the fact that our most enduring, not to say stubborn, learnings are the prejudices gained early in life from parents and from the unchallenged authority of society. Authority-guided learning, more- over, is more economical of time, and it often leads the learner to formulate insights which he would never have been able to achieve unaided. The Progressive Movement has per- haps rightly stressed the necessity of the learner's own creative activity; let us not forget that this activity is often launched, guided, and sustained by creative author- ity. Authority thus has a role, a most important role, in the educative process. There are acute problems concerning the effectiveness of authority; and there are no less acute problems of ethical pro- priety. These problems are not solved by stressing chiefly, as Cantor does, the way in which authority and the resistance to authority block self-change. H. B.
