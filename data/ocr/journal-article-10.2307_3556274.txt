<plain_text><page sequence="1">TENES. FROM time to time the figure of Tenes or Tennes, the eponymous hero of Tenedos, intrudes itself into discussions of larger matters connected with Greek religion, usually in order to lend support to some imaginative theory. As one of the latest examples might be instanced Dr. A. B. Cook's Zeus II., pp. 654 sqq. It is as well, however, to be certain as to the precise evidential value which attaches to the stories about Tenes before employing them to buttress further hypotheses. A little intensive study of these traditions will therefore not be unprofitable, even if the result should be almost wholly negative. For in that event we may be spared the trouble of placing much reliance upon edifices erected upon sand. The story of Tenes1 falls naturally into three sections, which for the convenience of reference I will call (i.) The advent of Tenes ; (ii.) The further adventures of Kyknos; and (iii.) The death of Tenes. (i.) Kyknos, king of Kolonoi on the Anatolian coast, married Prokleia, a princess of the Trojan royal house,2 by whom he had two children, Tenes and Hemithea. In some versions Tenes, though supposedly the son of Kyknos, was really the son of Apollo. After the death of Prokleia Kyknos married a second wife, Philonome, the daughter of Tragasos, who is the eponym of Tragasai in the Troad. The wicked stepmother tried in vain to seduce the virtuous Tenes, and enraged at her failure, persuaded Kyknos that he had attempted to violate her. In this crime she was abetted by the false witness of a flute-player named Molpos or Eumolpos. Believing in his son's guilt, Kyknos exposed Tenes, together with his sister Hemithea, in a chest upon the sea. The chest was eventually cast up by the waves upon the shores of the island Leukophrys, the inhabitants of which immediately made Tenes their king. In consequence of this the name of the island was changed from Leukophrys to Tenedos. (ii.) Kyknos subsequently discovered the truth; he stoned the flute-player and buried Philonome alive. He then sailed for Tenedos in order to seek his son's forgiveness. Here two alternative versions divide : (A) Tenes with an axe cut the hawser which moored his father's boat to the shore, and hence arose the proverbial saying ' Tenedian axe' for hasty and drastic action; (B) Kyknos was reconciled with his children, settled with them on Tenedos, and with them was subsequently killed by Achilles. (iii.) Of the death of Tenes there are two alternative versions: X. The Greek fleet on its way to Troy put in at Tenedos, and Tenes endeavoured to keep them off with stones. Achilles landed and, though he had been warned by 1 Relevant to the discussion of the story are Lykophron, Alexandra 232 sqq. with Tzetzesand Scholia, Herakleides Ponticus VII. (Mueller, F.H.G.

I. 38), for Philonome have no importance for our purposes. Where they are not blunders they depend upon theoretical reconstruction of Homeric genealogies.</page><page sequence="2">38 W. R. HALLIDAY his mother Thetis not to kill a son of Apollo, or not to kill Tenes who was a son of or peculiarly dear to Apollo, for if he did Apollo would slay him, he slew Tenes as he defended his country. Y. Achilles landed on Tenedos and pursued Hemithea, who was very beautiful. Tenes was killed in defence of his sister's honour She, pursued by Achilles, was swallowed up by the earth. Now Thetis had given Achilles a squire, who was charged with the duty of reminding him of his mother's warning. Although present he had failed in his duty, and when Achilles realized that he had killed Tenes and recalled the warning, he cut down the inefficient slave. The story that Achilles killed Tenes was used as the aition of a taboo against mentioning the name of Achilles in the shrine of Tenes. The story of the flute- player explained the rule that no flute-player might enter the shrine. That a cult of Tenes existed in Tenedos, of course, is certain. Tenes serves as one of Cicero's examples of mortals who have become gods,' and the name perhaps occurred to him because the carrying off of the cult statue from the island had figured in his catalogue of Verres' enormities.2 But for all that Tenes is a purely fictitious eponym who has been invented primarily to explain the name Tenedos, oMovE Twvov'o&amp;o. Almost without exception the authorities who narrate the story of Tenes and Hemithea, to whom we may add Pliny, N.H. V. I40, explain that the island, previously named Leukophrys, was called from Tenes Tenedos. It may be noticed, however, in passing that the authority of Hecataeus, which is often claimed for the story of Tenes and Hemithea (e.g. by Giessen, Philologus, LX., p. 469, or by Dr. Cook, of. cit., p. 673) is not admissible. Steph. Byz. s.v. Tve&amp;80s (= Jacoby, Fr. Hist. Gr. I, F. 139) reads vrro-os 03v IrRopd'8ov, s 'EKaoTasO, Ev 'EXEXAr70Tv). Here the authority of Hecataeus would seem to end with the stop, nor can it be guaranteed for the following sentence, diWb TEvvov Kai 'A/k0tl6aa i 'H/s9uas K.r.X. In fact, the alternative names for Tenes' sister, a characteristic which is frequent but only in late authorities, makes it improbable that these words can be from Hecataeus. Actually the first literary authority for the existence of the story, which is known, was the lost pseudo-Euripidean play Tennes, which was written at the end of the fifth century possibly by Kritias.3 The words Tenes and Tenedos are undoubtedly related. But equally certainly Fick' must be right in supposing that Tenes is derived from Tenedos, not, as the Greeks thought, Tenedos from Tenes. This Dr. Cook rather surprisingly welcomes. That Tenedos is the pre-Greek name for the island which survived the attempts of early Greek voyagers to replace it by the Greek name Leukophrys can hardly be doubted. Fick quotes examples of the recurrence of the name in Lycia and Pamphylia. The first part of it, I venture to suggest, may perhaps be recognized in Tenages, the Rhodian name of the Heliad whom other Greeks called Phaethon, and the name also of a small island off the Troad.6 Of the cult of Tenes we know no further facts beyond the theft of the cult image and the two taboos mentioned above. It can hardly be questioned that Farnell is right in supposing that the taboo upon mentioning the name of Achilles could not be prior to the epic.6 If, as I am inclined to believe, the legend of Tenes is an artificial compilation of elements adapted from hints in the epics at a relatively late date, it will be very much later. Actually there is no known trace in any surviving epic source of any knowledge of Tenes, and the circumstances of his death 1 Cicero, de nat. deor. III. 39. 2 Cicero, in Verr. II.

A close parallel to the taboo is provided by the rule at the sanctuary of Asklepios at Pergamos. 'Though they begin the hymns with Telephos (the father of Eurypylos), they say not a word about Eurypylos in them; indeed, they will not even name him in the temple, because they know he was the murderer of Machaon.'1 The other taboo in general character resembles that which forbade the entry of a keryx into the shrine of Okridion at Rhodes.2 In both cases an official who was normally present at a Greek sacrifice 3 was not allowed to participate in a specific cult. Flute-playing, like the use of garlands, was normal in Greek cult, and the absence of the flute and garland was a sign of mourning.4 It is one of the peculiarities which struck the Greek observer as remarkable, that at Persian sacri- fices no flutes or garlands were used.5 But exceptions to the general rule existed: OVYTtc /AEv Yap d3X"povg Kat VcXVgXov L0(TEV, O1K L0(/IEV ' aLvOov o~8'levSj evSrTO'TW.6 In the cult of the Charites at Paros no flutes or garlands were used, because, it was said, Minos received the news of the death of Androgeos when sacrificing to them.7 The story of the flute-player accomplice of Philonome is first given by Lyko- phron, but its occurrence, together with a mention of the taboo in Herakleides, makes it probable that it was found in Aristotle, Constitution of the Tenedians. The taboo is also mentioned byPlutarch and Diodorus. In Apollodorus, Plutarch and the Scholion on Lykophron the villain is given a name, the form of which, however, Molpos or Eumolpos, is professional rather than individual. So much for the extent of our certain knowledge about the cult of Tenes. One negative point may be added. There is no traditional evidence whatever to connect Tenes either with Zeus or with Dionysos. The only possible link, a very weak one indeed, is that one of the hypothetical explanations of the Janiform head upon the coins of Tenedos suggests that it represents the bearded Dionysos and Ariadne, an identifica- tion which in turn rests solely upon the presence of the bunch of grapes and amphora in association with the double axe of the reverse upon coins minted after 420 B.C., and the known existence of a cult of Dionysos Pelekus in Thessaly.5 As against this very fragile link must be placed the absolute unanimity of tradition which associates Tenes with Apollo. He is the son of Kyknos, who took his name from Apollo's bird, the swan; Apollodorus and a number of the later authorities state that though nominally the son of Kyknos he was really the son of Apollo; the warning given by Thetis to Achilles was either to beware of slaying a son of Apollo, or to beware of slaying Tenes, who was a son of, or was especially dear to, Apollo. What value the statement of Aristeides of Miletus (af. Steph. Byz. loc. cit.) may have, that the cult statue of Apollo in Tenedos carried a double axe, is doubtful. The authority of the forerunner of Petronius and Apuleius is not conclusive for the exact- ness of a statement about a specific local cult. Indeed, it may possibly have arisen simply out of the knowledge that Tenes was traditionally associated with Apollo, for by the time of Aristeides Tenes had become associated with every Tenedian peculi- arity, including the double axe of the coins and of the proverb. It is not, therefore, good evidence, though the statement may possibly be true. An Apollo with a double axe occurs upon coins of Eumeneia, but the analogy does not much help us, for 1 Pausanias III. 26, o0. 2 Plutarch, Quaest. Graec. 27. 3 For the keryx as a normal official of sacri- fice see Athenaeus, XIV. 79, 66o, and the refer- ences in Stengel, Kultusaltertiimer, p. 50. 4 Stengel, op. cit., p.

HALLIDAY Eumeneia was a foundation of Attalus II. of Pergamum.1 But whether Aristeides' statement is true or false, in neither case is it discordant with the rest of tradition, which associates Tenes with Apollo and with no other god. Let us next consider Hemithea. Of a cult of Hemithea in Tenedos there is no direct evidence whatever. It may also be noticed that Dr. Cook's somewhat con- fident deductions as to her character as an underworld goddess 2 rest upon a detail in the story, which is in all probability a Hellenistic addition. It is not impossible, however, that a cult of Hemithea may have existed. Lykophron 229 attests a Tenedian cult of Palaimon, whom he calls #pebOKr6vos, because, as the Scholiast explains, infants were sacrificed to him. This epithet but adds to our difficulties. I should agree with Farnell that Moloch will not help us here. For though the evidence for Palaimon 6peorKTvos is not earlier than Lykophron, the ritual may probably be associated with a whole series of Ino-Palaimon legends, which were undoubtedly current in the Greek world at an early date. But the equation Meli- kertes= Melqart is at best a product of the theokyasia, and quite inadmissible for earlier than Hellenistic times. I am not altogether happy about Farnell's explana- tion of the ritual of apotheosis in the cauldron,3 but can suggest nothing better. But, however that may be, we have a cult of Palaimon attested for Tenedos. Now W eizsiicker's theory4 of the original independence of Ino-Leukothea and Melikertes-Palaimon is almost certainly wrong. The apparent worship of one of these figures alone in specific cults is probably due merely to the relative emphasis laid upon one or other of the pair in particular places. Wherever our knowledge of the detail is at all adequate, the figure of the other always appears in the background, as at the shrine of Palaimon at Corinth which contained a statue of Leukothea.' Ino-Leukothea and Melikertes-Palaimon seem in fact to be an inseparable divine pair.6 If, therefore, a Palaimon was worshipped at Tenedos, a Leukothea is likely to have had at least a subordinate place in the cult. But that Hemithea is a divine person of the same character as the heroine else- where known as Ino-Leukothea can hardly be doubted. It is not a question merely of stressing the alternative names Leukothea for Hemithea in the Tenes story as given by Schol. II. I. 38, and Eustathius, p. 33, 23. For Farnell is clearly right in detect- ing in this divine pair of mother and son, each with alternative names, one Greek and one un-Greek, the survival from pre-Hellenic religion of divinities whose worship the Greeks adopted.' Characteristic are the hieratic legends connected with the cult of a leap from the cliff into the sea, or the exposure of mother and son in a floating chest. To this category belongs the heroine worshipped as Hemithea in Carian Kastabos, a mantic healing cult operating by incubation which continued to enjoy a consider- able vogue in the Graeco-Roman world of late classical times.8 Its legend contains the leap from the cliff, as does that of the Rhodian Halia-Leukothea, who was made into a sister of the Telchines in the late reconstructed version of Rhodian pre- history.9 Similar figures in Crete, Delos, and the southern Sporades attest the distribution of this type of cult in the Aegean Islands and on the Carian coast. It may therefore well have existed in Tenedos before the Greeks came there. We cannot, therefore, deny the possibility of the existence in Tenedos of the worship of a heroine, who was named by the Greeks Hemithea, in association with Palaimon, though the evidence, as we have it, suggests that here, as at the Isthmus of Corinth, local interest centred upon the son and the mother was a secondary figure. 1 Head, op. cit. p 673 2 Cook, Zeus II., p. 670. 3 Farnell, Hero Cults, pp. 42 sqq. 4 Roscher, Lexikon III., 1257. 5 Pausanias II. 2, 1. 6 Farnell, ot. cit., pp. 39-40- 7 Farnell, of. cit., pp. 35-47. 8 Diodorus V. 63. 9 Diodorus V. 55.</page><page sequence="5">TENES 41 But this Hemithea, it will at once be observed, has nothing Per se to do with Tenes. Further, if we look at the first part of our story, we shall see that it presents some curious features. Tenes is believed by his father to have committed adultery with his stepmother, and is exposed in a chest. But why should Hemithea have been so treated merely because she believed in her brother's innocence ? Nor do I know of a parallel in legend where an adult brother and sister are similarly jointly exposed on account of the crime of one. Further, in Greek mythology exposure in the floating chest is elsewhere invariably the result of a father's anger at his unmarried daughter's bearing of a child to a god, and the typical persons of such legends are not two adults nor brother and sister, but mother and infant, Danae and Perseus, Auge and Tele- phos,1 Semele and Dionysos.2 I believe that Pfister3 is so far correct in thinking that the story of Tenes is a 'translation legend.' Tenes is really an abstraction, the eponym of Tenedos. But since, as we saw, the Greeks assumed that the Greek name Leukophrys was primary and had been changed to Tenedos, it was obviously necessary to bring Tenes, from whom, according to them, the new name was derived, to the island from outside. He is consequently given a suitably neighbouring origin upon the adjacent mainland, and to account for the motive of his arrival use is made of the Potiphar's Wife tale, which is one of the stock instruments of the storyteller for starting a young and virtuous hero upon his required travels.4 For the means of miraculous transport recourse is made to a rather clumsy adaptation of Hemithea's chest. I am inclined to think that the advent of Tenes, itself an artificial aition, is the original kernel to which the further adventures of Kyknos and the death of Tenes were later added. How early the advent of Tenes became received doctrine we have unfortunately no means of knowing, and hence we are not really in a position to form a sound opinion as to the precise relationship between the story and the mysterious Janiform heads on the Tenedian coinage, which begins about 550 B.c.5 In view of the wild theories which have been put forward about these coins, it may be as well to notice that ' such heads are not peculiar to Tenedos and their explanation is difficult.'6 In fact, we have no means of knowing what actually they represent. Guesses have been various-Dionysos and Ariadne, Zeus and Hera, Tenes and Hemithea. The last view, that of Eckhel, is not impossible, but there would be more to be said for it, if the evidence for the prominence of Hemithea in Tenedian cult were stronger than it is. As matters stand, it seems to me more probable that the remarkable but quite independent coin types were later brought into relation with the advent of the eponym and his sister Hemithea. The reverse of Tenedian coins bore an upright double axe, which in some of the series stands apparently between two pillars. In spite of Ridgeway's contention that the axes represent traces of a primitive axe currency, it is almost certain that the design points to a survival in Tenedian cult of the sacred double axe of the Bronze Age. Nor in view of the Carian analogy, the cult of the Zeus Labraundeus, is such a survival geographically improbable. The precise significance of the double axe in Aegean cult is a difficult matter, into which we need not here go at length. I confess that the bisexual axe of which the Janiform head is an anthropomorphic version seems to me an improbable flight of fancy which is not very helpful, and I may here record my complete agreement with Nilsson7 that the Cretan double axe more 1 Strabo XIII. 615 ; Pausanias VIII. 49. 2 Pausanias III. 24, 3. 3 Pfister, Reliquienkult, I., p. 215. 4 The incident is as old as the oldest known folktale, the Egyptian Two Brothers. For a recent note on its distribution see Penzer- Tawney, The Ocean of Story, II., pp. 120 sqq. 5 The series of designs is well illustrated by Dr. Cook, op. cit., Figs. 583-596, pp. 654-658. 6 Head, op. cit., p. 551. 7 Nilsson, History of Greek Religion, pp. 15-16.</page><page sequence="6">42 W. R. HALLIDAY probably acquired its religious significance from its original use as an instrument of sacrifice than as the weapon of a thunder god. The latter and current view rests solely upon deductions from analogies which are probably false, and derives little support from an unbiassed study of the cult scenes upon Aegean objects of art. But however that may be, I should agree with Dr. Cook and others that our coins may be held to testify to the existence of a sacred axe in Tenedos. The Tenedians used the axe as their badge, and their ancient dedications at Delphi took this form. 'Tenedian axe' became a proverb for hasty or dramatic action. Now I can find no trace of any original connexion between Tenes and the axe. There is none in the advent of Tenes. But there is a noticeable and very intelligible tendency as time went on to bring every Tenedian peculiarly into relation with the eponym. The view that as regards the axes this relation is secondary is supported by the fact that alternative aitia were current. Thus while Pausanias tells the story of Tenes in connexion with the Delphian dedication, Plutarch has quite a different explanation. The company in de Pyth. orac. 12, 399 F., admire the bronze palm with frogs and watersnakes round its roots, which was then still to be seen in the Treasury of the Corinthians, but the question arises as to its appropriateness; for Corinth is not in fact remarkable for palm-trees or frogs and is not marshy. The dedication, therefore, is not easily explicable like that of the canting parsley from Selinus or the axes dedicated by the men of Tenedos, ' because of the crabs found round the place which they call Asterion, the only ones, it appears, with the brand of an axe on the shell.' I have summarized the context to make it clear that in Plutarch there is no hint nor suggestion of any magical or religious character attach- ing to these crabs. In consequence the pertinence of the highly-speculative pages (663-667) which Dr. Cook devotes to Cabiric crabs, Seriphian lobsters and Zeus Osog6a may legitimately be questioned. As regards the coin types and the proverb ' Tenedian axe,' the explanation given in Aristotle's Constitution of the Tenedians can be recovered from Stephanus Byzan- tinus and Herakleides Ponticus. A certain king had once ruled Tenedos, who put his son to death under his own law that adulterers must be slain with an axe. This event was commemorated on the coins which represent the axe on one side and the king and his son on the other, the female head being here misinterpreted as that of a beardless youth. In Aristotle Tenes does not figure in the story, but in the lexicographers and paroemiographers on TEv8&amp;o to$vv5yopos 'a certain king' has become Tenes, thanks no doubt to the tendency, already noticed, to connect all Tenedian memorabilia with the eponym. Here again we may notice that the sugges- tion of Dr. Cook that some half-forgotten ritual of rending a member of the royal family in pieces may underlie ' the later rationalized and romanticized legend"' is a gratuitous flight of imagination. It is surely more probable that it is an artificial aition of the coin type and proverb, which belongs to the same genre as, if it is not directly adapted from, the story of Zaleukos and his son, who was convicted under his father's adultery law.2 An alternative aition made Tenes the king of Tenedos, who caused an execu- tioner with an uplifted axe to stand behind the parties pleading in order to exercise summary punishment upon those convicted of perjury. This story first occurs in the lexicographers on TEV;tos &amp;ivOponos and TEv~8tos $vvlyopos, but Robert3 may be right in detecting an allusion to it in the passage of Euripides' Telephos (Frag. 706) which is parodied in the Acharnians. 1 Cook, op. cit., p. 668. 2 Val.

If Euripides knew the story, it was evidently well established, though not necessarily with Tenes as the hero, in the fifth century; on the other hand, it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the passage in Euripides may have suggested the form of the story. The proverbial axe was also explained by the version of the further adventures of Kyknos, which I have labelled A. The alternative explanation of the axe given by Aristotle and the omission of any of the further adventures of Kyknos in Herakleides make it probable that the Constitution of the Tenedians contained only the advent of Tenes. The hewing of the hawser occurs in Pausanias and Konon and may have formed part of the plot of the pseudo-Euripidean play.' It is in any case a poor story in itself, and it supplies a most feeble explanation of the proverb. The variant B which carries Kyknos to Tenedos and reconciles him with his children occurs only in the Scholiast on Lykophron and, by implication, in the version followed in the text of Lykophron. Neither Apollodorus, Diodorus, nor Plutarch bring Kyknos to Tenedos, and the whole section has the appearance of a subsequent addition to the advent of Tenes. Coming finally to the death of Tenes at the hand of Achilles, we have two versions which I have called X and Y; both seem to be artificial additions. The version X occurs in Pausanias, Diodorus, and Apollodorus' Epitome, the last a fact which strengthens the view, which Bethe expressed before the Epitome had been published,' that Diodorus was here drawing upon Apollodorus. X evidently represents sound Peripatetic tradition, but, for all that, the story of how Tenes tried to keep off the Greeks with stones and was slain by Achilles in defence of the island must surely be modelled upon the killing of Kyknos by Achilles, a famous epic theme which Aeschylus used for tragedy.3 But if X is suspect, Y is patently a Hellenistic iPE'p0LKbV racWrna, as I had marked it down before I discovered the welcome confirmation of Robert's opinion.4 It occurs only in Plutarch and in the Scholia on Lykophron. The text of Lyko- phron is not explicit, beyond the statement that both children and their father were killed by Achilles. Robert further points out that our story is probably modelled upon the epic incident of the pursuit of Polyxena and the death of Troilos. The episode of the forgetful slave, which occurs first in the version of Lykophron, is again a stock cliche with those later writers who served up epic matter with fresh trimmings. &amp;68rro-av 8c KaL &amp;XLo~ rwV qP&amp;(OV wVj)(LOVeg. Thus Asklepiades Myrleanus told how Chalkon had been appointed mnemon to Antilochus by Nestor, Timolaos of Macedon how Achilles had attached Eudoros to Patroklos, Antipater of Akanthos how Dares failed Hector in this capacity, and Eresios how Protesilaos should have been warned by Thessalian Dardanos.5 My own view of the Tenes story is briefly this. The hero is merely an eponym, the story of his advent to Tenedos is an artificial invention ad hoc, and his association with Hemithea is an accident due to the way in which the exigencies of the required plot were met. When the story was invented there is no means of knowing. It is not necessarily older than the fifth century B.c. I suspect that the coin types existed 1 See Preller-Robert, of. cit., p. 387. 2 Bethe, 'Untersuchungen zu Diodor's Insel- buch,' Hermes XXIV.

It was the coins and the axe of cult, the existence of which they probably attest, which give rise to the connexion of Tenedos with axes. The association of Tenes with axes appears to me purely secondary and due to the desire to connect the eponym with the Tenedian badge. The 'cutting the hawser' story may date back to the end of the fifth century. At best it is a feeble and artificial aition. The Aristotelian Constitution of the Tenedians certainly contained the advent of Tenes, including the taboo on flute-players. That it carried the story further I doubt. Subsequently two main streams of tradition may possibly be distinguished. The one for which the channel may have been Apollodorus' Catalogue is represented by Pausanias, Diodorus, and Apollodorus' Epitome. Here Pausanias has the 'cutting the hawser' omitted by the other two, and Diodorus alone has the taboo on the name of Achilles. The other is represented by Plutarch and the Scholia on Lyko- phron. Here the Peripatetic tradition has been supplemented or adulterated from some romantic Hellenistic source. The Scholia on Lykophron contain version B of the further adventures of Kyknos which are omitted by Plutarch. Plutarch, like Diodorus, has both taboos. The details of this reconstruction of the history of the story are inevitably hypo- thetical and cannot pretend to finality, but the general character of the Tenes stories has, I hope, been sufficiently established. Unless I am mistaken, they have no evidential value whatever in the discussion of broad questions of Greek religious origins or of the nature of Greek religious beliefs. If that is so, it may save some futile discussion and wasted labour to establish the fact. W. R. HALLIDAY. THE UNIVERSITY, LIVERPOOL. - Robert (op. cit., p. 386) implies that the legend was invented to explain the coin type. It is at least possible that the female head pointed the convenience of Hemithea's chest, and assisted in the association of Tenes and Hemithea.</page></plain_text>
