<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE* ATHENS AND ATTICA National Museum. The Direction of the National Museum reports that the structural work has been completed for the new Mycenaean gallery which will hold the Shaft-grave treasures, and for the other prehistoric rooms (Fig. I). These will be the first rooms before the visitor on entering by the main door of the museum. Upstairs a third large gallery now open contains pottery from the Aegean islands and Cyprus, together with early-seventh-century vases and figurines from Boeotia. But the main feature of the gallery is the group of Attic vases from Tomb A at Vari, which gives a remarkable picture of Attic craftsmanship at the end of the seventh century before the time of Solon. Another newly opened room upstairs has archaic bronzes and terracottas, mostly from FIG. I.-NEw PREHISTORIC ROOM IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM, ATHENS. sanctuaries like the Argive Heraion, Perachora, and Artemis Orthia. A large number of the bronzes and ivories have been cleaned. Most of the sculpture brought to the Museum last year came from Attica. New bronzes include a fine mirror-handle in the shape of a woman wearing a peplos, Peloponnesian work of about 470- 460 B.C. A round mirror cover of the fourth century B.C. found in Athens has a unique relief which Karouzo interprets as Daidalos. He is represented as a naked man wearing a conical helmet, and making what appear to be wings. An archaic bronze belt from Kerastiri near Asda in Arcadia, apparently Argive work of about 600 B.C., has an interesting relief scene of chariots. One charioteer carries a Boeotian shield, while small figure-of-eight shields are held by two facing warriors between the chariots. The Epigraphical Museum is being entirely reconstructed, and all the inscriptions have for the moment been removed. Over Ioo inscriptions from the Acropolis are now incorporated in the collection. The Agora. Excavation in this twentieth season of work by the American School of Classical Studies was confined to the SE corner of the area. ' The ancient roadway which ran past the south side of the market square was here explored over a length of 80 m. This important thoroughfare, which followed a natural course from east to west at the foot of the Areopagus and Acropolis, came into prominence with the establishment of the Agora in the sixth century B.c. On its north side * ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS: I am very grateful to those whose names appear in the text for the reports and photographs of work done by them; also to Professor Orlandos for accounts of the many excavations conducted during the past year under the auspices of the Greek Archaeological Society (indicated in the text by A.S. in brackets), to the Director, Mr. Kh. Karouzo, for a description of new arrangements and fresh acquisitions in the National Museum, and to Mr. Mitsos for information about the Epigraphical Museum. To Professor H. Thompson I am indebted for an account of the American excavations in the Athenian Agora, and to Dr. N. Platon for permission to use his report on the year's work in Crete which will appear in Kretika Khronika, and to M. P. Courbin for making available a French translation. I am much obliged to Mr. Llewellyn Brown, who kindly read through the draft and suggested several useful improvements and corrections.</page><page sequence="2">4 M. S. F. HOOD the road was bordered by a row of public buildings of the sixth and fifth centuries, on the south by houses and small shops. Beneath the lowest road metal appeared the foundations of private houses dating from the seventh and early sixth centuries B.C., which had been demolished as the public square took shape and form. At a still lower level was encountered a thick deposit of the Late Helladic and Middle Helladic periods, the first actual deposit of the Bronze Age thus far found in the Agora proper or its immediate environs. ' Within the mass of accumulated road metal are two water conduits which served in turn the two principal fountain houses of the Agora. The earlier conduit consisted of round terracotta pipes approximately 0o60 m. long and 0.30 m. in outside diameter (presumably two and one ancient feet) (Fig. 2). The sections are carefully secured to one another in the usual archaic manner by tongue-and-groove joints, and each section is provided with a lidded, round aperture so placed as to permit the workman in laying the pipes to reach in and seal the joint. The pipes are glazed on the interior. Some have ligatures painted on the exterior; others, of slightly different fabric, have the name " Charon " incised in the clay while still soft. The date suggested by the letter forms and by the stratigraphy related to the conduit is the last quarter of the sixth century B.C. FIG. 2.-EARLY WATER CONDUIT IN THE AGORA. 'This early pipeline, which approached the Agora from the east, presumably drew its water from some source outside the city. Its destination was the so-called Southeast Fountain House discovered in 1952 at the SE corner of the market square (Hesperia XXII (1953), 29-35). The confirmation thus given for the early date and the abundant water supply of that structure increases the probability that it was the fountain house referred to by Pausanias (I, 14, I) as the Enneakrounos. ' About a century later, i.e. in the last quarter of the fifth century B.c., the terracotta conduit was replaced by a stone aqueduct with floor, side walls and roof of massive blocks of soft gray poros. Its interior measures ca. 0.45 m. in width and ca. 1.20 in height, i.e. 1i x 4 ancient feet. Since the new channel approaches from the same direction as the old, and at the same level, it presumably drew from the same source. After delivering some of its water to the Southeast Fountain House, the stone aqueduct continued to its principal destination, viz. the so-called Southwest Fountain House which came to light in 1934 at the S.W. corner of the market square (Hesperia XXIV (I955) 52-54). In view of the date and scale of this installation, it is tempting to recognize in it the aqueduct (agogj) of IG., 12, 54 with the financing of which the sons and nephews of Perikles were concerned. 'Of particular interest among a number of wells of various periods which served the private establishments along the south side of the ancient street is one which was in use throughout the first six centuries of the Christian era with the exception of a brief blank period after the Herulian destruc- tion of A.D. 267. The accumulated deposit in the well comprised great numbers of vases, especially</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 5 water containers, lamps, glass vessels, household utensils, etc., in chronological sequence. One of the water pitchers, a globular jug o'I 74 m. in height of a type common in the late fourth and early fifth centuries A.D., has incised on its shoulder the inscription TrS rTTapO~vou surmounted by the Christian monogram; it was presumably the property of some nearby shrine of the Virgin. ' Three other ancient wells were encountered and explored this season at various points beneath the south part of the Stoa of Attalos. All three date from the archaic period. Taken in conjunc- tion with several other wells of the same era cleared in previous years in this region, they point to intensive private habitation along the east border of the market square. The vast mass of pottery recovered from one of this group of wells in 1934 (Hesperia XXIV (i955) 62-66), and the presence of distinctive potter's clay in one of those explored in 1955, suggest that the wells had served a potters' quarter which would seem to have been wiped out in the Persian sack of 480-479 B.C. 'The earliest of the three archaic wells excavated in 1955 lay just off the SW corner of the Stoa, and beneath the underpinning for the Fountain House at the south end of the Stoa terrace. It was of exceptional size, 1'50 m. in diameter, with two sets of foot holes in the smoothly cut sides. The well seems never to have been used; at least there were no whole water jars at the bottom. It was filled in at one time when the project was abandoned. A considerable quantity of pottery, both fine and coarse, was recovered from this filling; the date of the deposit is the second quarter of the sixth century B.C., and there is nothing in it that need be later than the five-sixties. Of special FIG. 3.-FRAGMENT OF BLACK-FIGURE AMPHORA FROM ARCHAIC WELL IN THE AGORA. FIG. 4.-OINOCHOE WITH SATYR-HEADS FROM ARCHAIC WELL IN THE AGORA. interest are fragments of seven or eight large terracotta ovens, of the sort hitherto known only from representations in terracotta figurines (Arch. Eph. 1896, pl. II). Also remarkable are two wooden combs, apparently of olive wood; the larger, quite well preserved, is a double comb with 31 fine teeth at one end and 20 coarser teeth at the other. The central space on one side is decorated with a lightly incised double egg and dart pattern. A fragmentary amphora of the one-piece variety has a decorated panel on either side. On one side is a very striking bearded head to which an abbreviated body is attached at the lower left; perhaps a male siren (Fig. 3). The style is crisp and strong, and the subject unusual. Another pot with an effective scene is a small spherical oinochoe, decorated with a pair of grotesque satyr-heads glaring at each other across a floral orna- ment (Fig. 4). This vase recalls the amphora already noted in its vigorous style, its use of red for broad surfaces and its choice of subject.' There has been steady progress in the work of landscaping the Agora, and of reconstructing the Stoa of Attalos which is to serve as a museum (Figs. 5, 6). Athens. I. Meliades and G. Dontas (A.S.) are exploring the area south of the Acropolis, where the course of the boulevard of Dionysius the Areopagite, which used to run past the Odeion of Herodes Atticus, has been diverted down the slope to the south. Last year work was virtually confined to the strip of ground covered by the new boulevard. In the eastern part of this area by the modern church of Ayia Sofia an interesting series of houses came to light covering about I,ooo years of Attic history. A house of the fifth century B.C. underlay another of the fourth century with rooms grouped around a court containing a cistern. At the beginning of the first century B.C. this was destroyed by fire, perhaps during Sulla's attack on Athens. Above it was a large house of</page><page sequence="4">6 M. S. F. HOOD the late Roman period which was apparently destroyed before it was built during the sack by the Herulians in A.D. 267. About A.D. 400, shortly after the invasion of Alaric, when there appears to have been a great outburst of building activity at Athens, another house of exceptional size and magnificence was FIG. 5.-VIEW SHOWING LANDSCAPING OF THE AGORA WITH TIIE THESEION IN THE DISTANCE. constructed in this same area. This house continued in use throughout the fifth and into the sixth century A.D. Meliades cites a passage from the life of Proklos, the last of the Neoplatonist philo- sophers, which suggests that this might even be his house. Only a part has been excavated, but in it was a large hall convenient for lectures to audiences, having an apse at one end, with the floor at FIG. 6.-STOA OF ATTALOS IN COURSE OF RECONSTRUCTION AS MUSEUM FOR THE AGORA. a higher level and a railing of slabs dividing it from the rest of the hall. Both the hall and the apse were paved with fine decorative mosaics. A little room outside the apse appears to have been a shrine. It had a rectangular niche inserted into the back of the apse wall, containing an altar or bench for offerings, of which the front was adorned with a grave relief of the Classical period. Built into the wall of the niche above the altar was a relief of Cybele. In the western part of the excavated area, between Erechtheion and Propylaion Streets,</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 7 a fine Roman cistern came to light with a well beside it. South of this was a house built round a central court, with colonnades on each side about the same date as the Odeion of Herodes Atticus. In this area was found an interesting deposit which yielded some 2,000 fragments of fine black and red figure vases of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. Marriage Scenes predominate among the subjects represented, and the chief shape is the loutrophoros. More- over, on the rims of some of the vases are graffitos reading: ]os NuvpTE[, N]VCpqr~ tSEp etc. This material appears to come from some unknown Shrine of the Nymphs which may have been affected by the transformation of the area when the Odeion of Herodes Atticus was built. In the deposit together with these Classical sherds were lamps and other objects of the early second century A.D.; and under it a thick layer of marble chips, presumably from stone dressing during the construction of the Odeion. A section of the city wall with a new gate has come to light south of this area in Erechtheion Street. The wall and the gate in its original form date from the mid-fourth century B.C. The wall cannot therefore be that of Themistocles; but the gate may be the traditional Phaleron Gate. Tombs of the Geometric period found beneath and beside the gate prove that there was a road here leading out of the city from early times. Two of these tombs yielded eighty-six fine vases of the mature Geometric style; near by was a sub-Mycenaean grave with stirrup jars, and a Proto-geometric grave with signs of a funeral pyre above. About I m. south of this wall and gate was a secondary wall running roughly parallel to it. Outside this wall on the south and west a number of holes dug into the original ground surface contained Proto-geometric urns with cremation burials. It seems that the Athenians respected these early tombs when they came upon them in building their wall in the fourth century B.C., and surrounded them with an enclosure. Ph. Stavropoulos (A.S.) excavated on the property of P. Boutzeyias just north of the area of Plato's Academy following the discovery of an interesting Archaic well. Three more archaic wells were discovered containing pottery and other objects from the second half of the sixth to the end of the fifth century B.C. Decorated sherds found in this place over the past three years during commercial excavations appear to come from an ancient ground surface 6 or 7 m. below that today. Trial trenches in the area produced a quantity of prehistoric sherds, mostly Early Helladic, with traces of Middle Helladic and possible Neolithic. These no doubt belong with the known pre- historic settlement on the site of Plato's Academy to the south. Attica. I. Papademetriou (A.S.) excavated four more chamber-tombs in the Mycenaean cemetery at Votila near Aliki, recovering over 170 vases and many clay figurines. Burial niches in the sides of the dromoi of the tombs produced rich grave goods, including necklaces of glass-paste beads. All the tombs are assigned to L.H. III B-C. One remarkable vase has the shape of a shoe with upturned toe and what appear to be wings painted on the sides of the heel. An interesting figurine shows what is evidently a woman, perhaps a goddess, seated upon a throne and holding a child. S. Iakovidhis (A.S.) continued work in the Mycenaean cemetery at Perati on the north side of the harbour at P6rto Raifti (Fig. 7). Part of a Mycenaean road was cleared running along the edge of the torrent above which the tombs lie. The tombs are mostly quite small, with semi- circular or semi-elliptical chambers, and no distinct entrance or dromos. Besides the chamber tombs there were two small rectangular graves containing child burials. All the I 16 vases recovered last year belong to L.H. III. Notable are a bronze sword in a fine state of preservation, and an iron knife with bronze rivets in the handle, found in the same tomb. A mass of faience beads, some shaped like crocodiles and others anthropomorphic, are evidently of Egyptian origin. A fragment of glass, clearly imported, may also be Egyptian. Two more cremation burials, both of adults, make a total of four cremations that have been found in this cemetery to date. These were in tombs which also contained inhumation burials, some earlier and some later than the cremations. In one case a small jug contained the burnt bones; in the other they were found scattered among the burials in the tomb, together with a little burnt wood and fragments of a jug which had been burnt and twisted out of shape by the heat of the pyre. Papademetriou (A.S.) reports scanty traces of an earlier shrine of the beginning of the sixth century B.C. identified during the course of cleaning operations inside the temple at Brauron. From the little shrine to the east of the temple were recovered a number of fine decorated sherds of the sixth and fifth centuries B.c., together with many terracotta figurines, dedications to Artemis. Trials in the prehistoric settlement on the north slope of the hill overlooking the sanctuary revealed part of a massive wall which appears to be Middle Helladic. D. Theochares (A.S.) continued work in the important Early Helladic settlement on the height of Askitaridn by the sea south of Rafina. Three superimposed Early Helladic building levels are</page><page sequence="6">8 M. S. F. HOOD equated by Theochares with E.H. I, II, and III. Remains of Mycenaean houses overlie the latest Early Helladic structures. Only the buildings of the last Early Helladic phase (E.H. III) were extensively cleared. A section of the strong defence wall of the Early Helladic settlement was uncovered. The lower stone part of the wall is about 2.50 m. thick, and appears to have stood at least 3 m. high, with mud brick above. There was again a rich haul of pottery, including many complete vases with a variety of interesting shapes, notably of the latest Early Helladic phase. In Rafina itself Theochares examined an Early Helladic building near the Early Helladic bronze- smelting works by the shore. Finds here included many vases and a decorated clay hearth, with fragments of a stone mould and bronze slag. Eleusis. In the north-west corner of the area west of the Great Propylaia, containing the houses of the priests and other auxiliary buildings of the shrine, I. Travlos and M. Philinis (A.S.) have excavated a large Classical house which may be the Prytaneion. This house, measuring 1640o X o10-50o m., was in a remarkably good state of preservation considering all the repairs and alterations which it had undergone during the six and a half centuries of its existence. The outside walls consisted of high poros orthostats with mud brick above. The walls inside the building were  / AIA;K ()IT, A o 46 :110 for A ,, IQ 5" ArA$KA4P?VT?5 T A ;?O 0 9 so 23 40 o Ib FIG. 7.-PLAN OF THE MYCENAEAN CEMETERY AT PERATi NEAR PORTO RAFTI, ATTICA. coated with fine plaster, red or yellow in colour. The floors were strewn with small beach pebbles. The building resembles other Classical and Hellenistic houses in plan, except that it has two large halls which were evidently used as dining-rooms, where those serving at the sanctuary were fed at the public expense. The excavators suggest that the building may also have housed the staples for weights and measures, which are known to have been kept at Eleusis as well as at Athens. In fact, two or three of these were actually found in this region during the excavations. A long, narrow compartment down one side of the building with a large double door at the end leading on to the road just next to the gate to the town may have housed the sacred waggons in which the cult objects of Demeter and the statue of lacchos were carried to Athens during the Great Mysteries. G. Mylonas (A.S.) continued work in the cemeteries of Eleusis, uncovering in all 136 tombs of which twenty-nine were prehistoric. Some 400 vases were found of different periods and styles ranging from 18oo B.c. to A.D. 400. Most of the prehistoric tombs belonged to the latter part of the Middle Helladic period, and were cist-graves containing more than one body and only a few grave goods, usually vases and spindle whorls. Five bronze rings found in one such Middle Helladic grave Mylonas thinks may have been hair-rings. There were two Mycenaean tombs with vases, spindle whorls, and terracotta figurines. Mylonas notes that the figurines were found with child burials. The burials of the historic period were some in dug or built graves, others in stone or clay sarcophagi, amphorai, or pithoi. Many cremations came to light of the fifth and fourth centuries</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 9 B.c. But more interesting were the late Protogeometric and Geometric graves. The amphorai containing the ashes and the imperfectly burnt bones of the cremations were placed in holes in the ground. The mouths of the amphorai were closed with two-handled cups, and the different grave goods were put around them. In Protogeometric times adults appear to have been cremated, children being inhumed with many grave goods. One such child's grave produced about twenty Late Protogeometric vases. THE PELOPONNESE D. Pallas (A.S.) continued work on the large early Christian basilica church at Skoutila near Old Corinth. The width of the west side of the basilica complex has been ascertained as over 40 m. In the south aisle were found complete Corinthian capitals and fragments of columns. Pallas also examined a large Roman villa at Pdno Magotla about three kilometres along the road from Corinth to Argos. It is grouped round a square court which may have had porticos on three sides, and appears to date from a period after the middle of the third century A.D. Argos. The French School continued their important excavations on four distinct sites. (I) Deiras. Work in the Mycenaean cemetery here was prosecuted by J. Deshayes. In all fourteen FIG. 8.-MYCENAEAN JUG WITH A CHARGING BULL FROM ARGOS. FIG. 9.-EWER'FROM MYCENAEAN SHAFT-GRAVE AT ARGOS. chamber tombs and nineteen shaft-graves have been discovered. The finds confirm that Myce- naean Argos was at its zenith in Myc. III A 2-B. Three chamber tombs (XXI, XXIII, and XXIV) of Myc. III A 2 produced fine vases, including a stirrup vase decorated with a row of birds and a jug with a large boukranion. One most interesting tomb (XXIV) had an exceptionally large dromos prolonged by a kind of vaulted corridor. The chamber contained two skeletons enveloped in a whitish substance, which was also found in a heap on the floor, and inside some of the vases in the tomb. Finds from the tomb included bronze scale pans, a knife, and a mirror; a carved ivory plaque and an ivory comb; a sealstone, and stone spindle whorls and beads. Nearly a metre above the floor of the tomb was a two-handled jar, in shape already foreshadowing Protogeometric, with mysterious signs painted on it. From another chamber tomb (XXVI) came a Myc. III B jug with a picture of a charging bull (Fig. 8), and a lid which is thought to be Cretan. A beautiful ewer (Fig. 9) from one of the shaft-graves may also be an import from Crete. The shaft-graves yielded many vases of Myc. III A 2. (2) South quarter of Argos. P. Courbin and B. Groslier examined the stratigraphy here by means of a grid of thirty 4-m. squares dug down to an average depth of 3'50 m. (Fig. I o). Thirteen Middle Helladic tombs were excavated. Abundant fragments of Mycenaean pottery confirm that occupation during that period extended to this area. Five tombs contained Protogeometric vases; a Protogeometric bronze pin was found with remains of some textile round it. Two rich Geometric A2</page><page sequence="8">I o M. S. F. HOOD tombs produced between them thirty-two vases, including a large hydria and a handleless pyxis, shapes rare in the Argolid. Parts of a large decorated amphora a metre high were recovered from a well of the end of the Geometric period. A Late Geometric krater serving as a burial urn recalls those of Fusco in Sicily. Finds of the archaic and classical periods included a seventh-century FIG. I o.-ExcAVATIONS OF THE FRENCI SCHOOL IN THE SOUTH QUARTER OF ARGOS. FIG. I I.-RED-FIGURE KRATER FROM ARGOS SHOWING THESEUS AND THE MINOTAUR. krater; a fragment of a Protocorinthian pithos stamped with a lion, lioness, and bird; and parts of two fine Attic red-figure kraters, which recall the style of Hermonax, one showing a scene of Theseus with the Minotaur and Ariadne (Fig. i i). (3) Theatre and Odeion. In the theatre G. Roux cleared the lower part of the cavea, the orchestra, and the stage. In the central sector of the cavea the seats are cut in the rock; those in the wings partly consist of stone benches resting upon an artificial fill. At the beginning of the</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE II fourth century A.D. the orchestra was transformed into a pond for aquatic displays with a watertight wall round it. Nothing is now left of the Greek stage except some poros foundations. The actual stage which survives, with its brick proscenium adorned with niches, dates from the third century A.D., and was modified at the beginning of the fourth century. To the east of the stage are founda- tions of a Hellenistic portico running parallel to it, and therefore later than the original theatre. Inscriptions from the theatre include dedications to the Dioscuri and to Zeus Eubouleus, the signa- tures of three known Argive sculptors, three decrees of proxeny for the Arcadians, and a statue base. R. Ginouves worked on the Roman Odeion. The earliest Odeion dating from the first century A.D. was rectangular. It had at least thirty-five rows of benches curving round at the wings, with stairs in the centre and on the north and south sides. The whole of this first Odeion was contained inside the semicircle of the later Odeion, built in the third century A.D. (4) The interesting series of mosaics with pictures of the Months (Fig. I Ia), some of which had already been discovered by Vollgraff, were transported to the museum. The modern house above them had to be destroyed and afterwards rebuilt. The mosaics apparently belonged to a house of the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century A.D. Mycenae. I. Papademetriou (A.S.) has found traces of Middle Helladic houses in the new Royal Grave Circle by the Tomb of Clytemnestra. The houses clearly antedate the use of the area as a cemetery. Restoration work has been executed on a large scale during the last few years at FIG. I la.-LATE ROMAN MOSAIC OF TIIE MONTH AUGUST FROM ARGOS. Mycenae. A considerable part of the Cyclopean wall by the Lion Gate is now reconstructed. Last year work was done on the tholos Tomb of Aigisthos, Schliemann's Grave Circle, and the Palace. The unexcavated part of the deposit in the chamber of the Tomb of Aigisthos was cleared. Sherds of Palace Style vases include some which correspond with those found by Wace in 1922 (BSA XXV, plates XLVII-LII). In removing earth from the beginning of the dromos of Aigisthos a pavement of schist slabs set in strong white plaster was revealed. All the sherds beneath it were Middle Helladic, and Middle Helladic sherds were found in the fill at the beginning of the dromos and in a cutting made behind the dromos wall. South of the dromos part of a large house of the historic period was excavated. Pots were found lying in position beside a hearth, and from the fill came sherds of Corinthian ware of the late sixth century B.c., and part of a black-figure amphora with a picture of Dionysos, Silens, and Maenads on one side, and a chariot race on the other. Two small L.H. II shaft-graves came to light just outside the Cyclopean wall of the Acropolis. Part of the fill between 0-50 and 0o80 deep in the northern half of Schliemann's Grave Circle was excavated. Papademetriou reports an upper ashey layer with Middle Helladic, and a thick fill below it contain- ing Early Helladic with some possible Neolithic sherds. A Middle Helladic cist grave was found running under the Grave Circle enclosure wall. Most interesting was the discovery of a place for a throne with an altar and offering tables near it during restoration work in the porch of the great Megaron of the Palace. A slab of alabaster with a bowl-like hollow in the top was found by the south jamb of the porch; and between it and the south pillar of the porch were recovered pieces of what Papademetriou suggests may be an offering table, made of porphyry, o.85 m. square, with a raised circular piece in the middle, and four holes by which it had evidently been fixed to some base. A small excavation below the floor here</page><page sequence="10">12 M. S. F. HOOD brought to light by the south pillar a little circular structure, which Papademetriou thinks may be an altar near which the porphyry offering table had stood, and many fragments of round plaster offering tables painted with spirals and rosettes. A raised dais of plaster beside the alabaster slab on the south side of the porch is compared by Papademetriou with the place for a throne on the right of the entrance into the antechamber of the Megaron at Pylos. Lerna. A third season of excavations was completed by the American School under J. L. Caskey, with important results. In area D (Hesperia XXIV (I955) 27 and fig.. I) on the east side of the prehistoric settlement mound the water level was reached. Here in a depth of about 5'50 m. of deposit it was possible to distinguish fifteen different habitation levels, mostly Middle Helladic, but with L.H. III at the top and Early Helladic at the bottom. The earliest occupation deposits lie below the present water level. The whole of the impressive Early Helladic ' House of the Tiles ', over 25 m. long and nearly 12 m. wide, has now been cleared. This seems to have been only the latest, although no doubt the most elaborate, of a series of large buildings which had succeeded each other in this area. A room in an earlier building destroyed by fire produced a number of vases and lumps of clay with seal impressions, resembling in a general way those found two years ago in the ' House of the Tiles' (Hesperia XXIV (1955), plate 22 a-i), but with less variety in the patterns and FIG. 12.-JAR OF LATE PHASE OF EARLY HELLADIC FROM LERNA. less originality in the designs. Charred grains of wheat and a quantity of carbonised figs were recovered from some of the vases in this room. Below the Early Helladic levels was a great mass of debris, which had evidently been deposited in the course of extensive levelling operations; and under this again was Neolithic. The Neolithic houses seem to have been unpretentious structures with small rectangular rooms and walls of clay or mud brick on slight stone foundations. But the Neolithic pottery, by contrast, is of very fine quality, often entirely coated with, or bearing patterns in, orange-brown lustrous paint. The destruction of the ' House of the Tiles ' appears to have left a great heap of ruins on the site. It has now been established that a circle of rounded stones about 19 m. in diameter was set round this heap of ruins, forming a kind of peribolos to mark the spot where the building had stood. The site seems to have been respected and left unoccupied through several succeeding generations: but in the latest phases of the Early Helladic period houses began to encroach again upon it; many large bothroi or pits were dug at this time. Most of the pottery with characteristic Early Helladic painted decoration comes from these latest Early Helladic phases (Fig. 12). At Lerna Caskey emphasises there is no evidence for a sudden break or catastrophe separating the Early Helladic from the Middle Helladic periods. In the central part of the mound just to the east of the' House of the Tiles 'structures that may be assigned to the Middle Helladic period include a very large apsidal building with a central hearth. About twenty Middle Helladic burials, both</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE I3 cist graves and plain interments, were recovered. A second shaft-grave, similar to that found in 1954, came to light in the central area. The shaft measured fully 3 X 4 m. across, and was over 2 m. deep; the filling produced vast amounts of broken pottery of the end of Middle Helladic and the beginning of L.H. I. Near the SW corner of the grave at the bottom of the shaft were two vases, one a cup of the Vaphio shape with designs in black and red, the other a very fine rounded vessel decorated in dark matt paint with a delicate pattern of hatched diamonds. At the western end of the excavation area a built grave measuring about I-o x -8o m., with walls of rough stones and two huge cover slabs, was found about a metre below the surface. Above one of the cover slabs were resting a matt painted cup (Fig. 13) and a jug; and inside the grave were two other jugs of the same type. But the tomb had evidently been ransacked-the pebble floor had been disturbed -and apart from the jugs, some fragments of bronze and lead, and a few small bones, nothing was left in it. It seems improbable, Caskey notes, that ordinary robbers would deliberately remove skeletons, or replace cover slabs and fix them in position with small stones. He therefore speculates whether this large tomb, and perhaps the two shaft-graves as well, may not have been opened by descendants of the dead seeking not treasures but the bones themselves, as the Spartans later recovered the bones of Orestes and the Athenians those of Theseus. Cist graves and pithos burials of the FIG. I3.-CUP FOUND ON COVER SLAB OF MIDDLE HELLADIC GRAVE AT LERNA. Geometric period were investigated on the SE slope of Mount Pontinos. One small pithos contained the bones of a child or young person with three cups, a couple of jugs, two bronze rings, and a fibula. S. Charitonides (A.S.) continued work in the area of the Geometric and later cemetery in the district of Pr6noia at Nauplia. Remains of what appears to be a Geometric house were examined. To the west of this house successive layers of stones may represent a road. With one of the latest levels of this possible Geometric road was associated a peculiar tomb which had unfortunately been plundered. It was a circular pit, about 2 m. in diameter, with traces of a roof of wood or reeds covered by a layer of clay and large stone slabs above this. A cist grave was found containing two early Geometric vases with a semi-cremation burial-the skeleton partly preserved, but showing clear signs of burning as well. E. Stikas (A.S.) examined a large basilica church by the sea at Hermione following the discovery of a mosaic pavement with an inscription in front of the school there. The whole basilica complex is over 40 m. long and 17 m. wide. The church has a narthex and an apse, and an open court in front containing a large rectangular cistern. From the narthex five doors led into the church, one into the nave, and two into each of the aisles. The mosaics, which are unusually fine and varied, suggest a date in the sixth century A.D. That first discovered in the SW entrance porch lead- ing into the courtyard has attractive geometric designs forming octagonal panels, one with an eagle holding a partridge in its claws (Fig. I4), and another with a lamb; the inscription reads: 'Erri -ro Oeoth(?(?radrou) 'E-rrtiK6('rrov) f~'lv 'Evripavfiov &amp;vevEcO(rn) -r6 Epyov. The floor of the narthex</page><page sequence="12">14 M. S. F. HOOD was also paved with mosaics, having panels with pictures of animals and birds. Stikas examined other mosaic pavements which had come to light in courtyards of private houses in Hermione. Soundings by R. Ginouve's between the public buildings on the temple terrace at Gortys in Arcadia revealed two Roman (fourth century A.D.) and two Hellenistic levels. The materials used for the repairs and alterations to the bath building (see JHS LXXIII, I I7; LXXV Suppl. Io) were evidently taken from the poros foundations of the temple. It seems clear therefore that the construction of the temple never passed beyond the stage of laying the foundations. M. T. Reek- mans continued the excavation of the large house discovered in I954 on the northern edge of the second plateau south of the sanctuary. The house was of the type with a central court already well known at Gortys. The outside walls were composed of large blocks of polygonal masonry with very fine joints. Many coins of the second Arcadian League and pottery of the same period found in the occupation levels give a date for the house. FIG. 14.-MOSAIC WITH AN EAGLE HOLDING A PARTRIDGE IN EARLY CHRISTIAN CHURCH AT HERMIONE. Work was continued by K. Rhomaios (A.S.) in the town of the classical period on the Hill of the Ascension (Analipseos) by Vo~rvoura in Kynouria on the borders of ancient Tegea and Sparta (see JHS LXXV Suppl. io). The houses were of simple construction, with rough stone foundations supporting timber-framed clay walls, and tiled roofs. Some at any rate had evidently been des- troyed by fire. One building, 13'50 m. wide and the same length, with an apsidal back wall may be the Prytaneion or Bouleuterion. Inset along the front of this building was a row of four rough column bases looking like typical Mycenaean ones. Several of the houses had what appear to have been little domestic shrines in one corner. From these shrines came many dedicatory vessels, in- cluding a series of remarkable large red-figure vases which form the most impressive finds from the excavation. One of these, a large pelike, has a fine representation of Thetis riding a hippocamp and bearing the arms of Achilles. An exceptionally big jug, parts of which were found the previous year (see JHS LXXV Suppl. 10, there described as a krater), gives what Rhomaios suggests may be the most detailed picture yet known of the Birth of Helen. A fine Hydria has what appears to be the Judgement of Paris. This group of some six or seven large red-figure vases is assigned by Rho- maios to the last three or four decades of the fifth century B.c, He thinks that they may all be pro-</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE I5 ducts of the same great vase painter, a Lacedaimonian or Tegeatan working on the site and using local materials. Sparta. K. Khristou reports that part of the museum is now open. A Roman portrait head of a man dating perhaps from the end of the Republican period, and a small Latin tomb inscription, were recovered from a spot on the Tripolis road north of Sparta before the turning to the Sanctuary of Artemis Orthia. Excavations on the hill south of Krdkeai, where a large bronze bull's ear had been found, led to no results; but on the west slope of the hill a plundered Mycenaean chamber tomb produced traces of some four burials and two vases. A group of plundered tombs is reported from the neighbourhood of Kdmbos near Neipolis Vofon. A terracotta relief plaque depicting Artemis with a dog, fine local work of the mid-fifth century B.C. (Fig. 15), and fragments of terracotta figurines, were found at Dhaimdnies Moldon. At Mistrd N. Dhrandhakis (A.S.) examined Byzantine tombs round the church of Ayia Sofia. Two fine pins, a clay jug, and fragments of textiles were recovered. FIG. I5.-TERRACOTTA RELIEF PLAQUE OF ARTEMIS WITH A DOG FROM THE REGION OF SPARTA. FIG. I5a.-METOPE FROM THE TEMPLE OF ZEUS AT OLYMPIA WITH NEW FRAGMENTS ADDED. Pylos. C. W. Blegen continued the excavation of the Mycenaean palace at Epino Englianos (Old Pylos) (see ILN April 7th, 1956, p. 256-9, with plan and photos). The palace in its final phase consisted essentially of two major blocks or insulae separated by a court. The larger block to the NE, nearly 50 m. long and 32 m. wide, contained the principal royal apartments and the Megaron with its great Throne Room. The other south-western block included an open court, two hypostyle halls of considerable size, and many smaller rooms. Both blocks show evidence of stairways and were clearly two-storied. The excavation of the pottery store-room SW of the Propylon of the main entrance was com- pleted. Over 8oo vases, representing some twenty-three different shapes, have been recovered from this room. Farther to the NW one of the rooms entered from the Court of the Megaron was evidently a waiting room, with a white stuccoed bench and a pithos perhaps for wine set in a plaster- coated stand in an alcove. On the floor of the room adjoining this were scores of fallen goblets (kylikes), badly warped, and almost vitrified by the heat of the fire that destroyed the building. Two magazines immediately at the back of the Throne Room of the Megaron contained pithoi, provided with lids, and deeply set in stucco-coated benches or stands round the walls. On a bench</page><page sequence="14">16 M. S. F. HOOD in one of these magazines were two small jugs which had apparently been used as scoops or dippers. In the same magazine were found thirty-three tablets and fragments of tablets. In five instances Blegen reports the word E-LA-WO (kaitov) may be read, and the ideographic signs are those that have to do with olive oil. Flanking the Court of the Megaron on the NE was a two-columned stoa. A balcony above this may have offered ladies of the household a fine view of what took place in the court. NE of this stoa, and accessible through a doorway that opened into a long passage running down behind the east wall of the Megaron, five small rooms were cleared. The first of these appears to be a lobby, and was filled with fragments of pithoi, many bearing painted decoration, which had fallen from an upper story and suffered great damage from the effects of fire. Some fourteen tablets and fragments of tablets found with the pithoi offer evidence that they, too, had contained olive oil. From this lobby a door led south-eastwards into a bathroom. Here was a bathtub, consisting of a clay larnax with painted decoration, built into a brick and clay stand against the far wall. A low clay step rising above the stucco floor of the room made it easy to get into it. A goblet (kylix), broken but complete, lay on the bottom of the tub. Two large jars, set in a high stuccoed stand in one corner of the room, may have provided a supply of water for the bath. A channel conveyed waste water through the wall into a small court, where it fell into an underground drain. The frescoes recovered in preceding years have been studied, and P. de Jong has recognised and reconstructed several scenes in them. Griffins were evidently painted on the wall on each side of the throne in the Throne Room of the Megaron as in the Throne Room at Knossos. From the Throne Room also comes a representation of a man playing a five-stringed lyre. Griffins, per- haps several in a row, appear on a fresco from a large hypostyle hall in the SW block of the palace; and here was found part of a battle scene with a helmeted warrior surrounded by contorted and apparently falling human bodies. Hundreds of the clay vases from the palace have now been mended. Blegen reports that, so far as it is possible to judge, the great majority can be assigned to the typological category called Myc. III B, with an admixture of some elements of early III C. The excavations of Sp. Marinatos (A.S.) in the region of Old Pylos were attended with brilliant results. A cave known as ' Katav6thra' in the town of Khdra produced early prehistoric sherds, including perhaps Neolithic. Marinatos re-examined the tholos tomb already cleared by Kourou- niotis in I91 2 at Tragdna between the Palace of Nestor and the sea, and excavated another near it. From the hitherto unexcavated dromos of the former two heaps of bronze implements were recovered. Inside a large bronze amphora were two bronze spearheads with a dagger, two knives and a razor, and a mirror and cup. An amethyst sealstone has an interesting mythological scene: a bearded hero is attacking a helmeted warrior whom he has already killed, together with a young beardless man, evidently father and son. The other tholos tomb, although long ago plundered and occupied as a dwelling in the Hellenis- tic period, nevertheless produced a grave pit which had escaped intact. In it were the cremated remains of two princesses, the earliest perhaps and certainly the finest examples of Mycenaean crema- tions yet known. One princess had a necklace of amethyst beads, an ornament of glass paste, and a mirror with her; the other a necklace of gold nautilus-shaped beads and an engraved sealstone of rock crystal bound with gold, together with four others of agate and jasper. One of these gems has an interesting representation of a sacred tree flanked by two wild goats, which Marinatos sug- gests could be the emblem of the reigning dynasty of the area. The tree Marinatos thinks may be intended for a variety of cactus. Cactuses still flourish in Messenia, where they are cultivated by the peasants and give the region its peculiar sub-tropical appearance. The finds from this tomb are assigned by Marinatos to the period about 1400 B.c. Marinatos also completed the excavation of the unique Middle Helladic burial mound at Ayios Ioannis near Papoflia Pyllas. In the centre of the mound was a horseshoe-shaped structure which he would interpret as a house, evidently the common dwelling for all the dead buried inside large pithoi in the surface of the mound. Olympia. N. Yialouris reports that many of the bronzes and terracottas from the museum have been repaired and cleaned. These include pieces of archaic terracotta female statues found during the old excavations in the Altis. A number of fragments from the storerooms of the museum have been joined to the pediments and metopes of the Temple of Zeus (see Fig. I 5a). The iron dowels by which the metopes were fastened are being replaced with bronze. Yialouris (A.S.) did some supplementary investigations in the classical city on the heights of Bdmbes near Makrisia SW of Olympia. Fragments found during the excavations have been joined with others lurking in the storerooms of the museums at Olympia and Patras to form the pedestal of a large clay vase or perirrhanterion (stoup for holy water) assigned to the end of the seventh century B.C. It is decorated in relief with alternate rows of horsemen and rosettes. Bits of stone archaic statues and archaic capitals, together with bronze statuettes, including some of the Geo-</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE I7 metric period, have also been recovered. Near Dhidsella in the same region a late Mycenaean chamber tomb dug many years ago by the peasants produced a number of vases. There are signs of another unplundered tomb next to it. Near Rdmesi and Voudnargos not far from Pfrgos two slab- covered graves came to light with a few vases of the fifth and fourth centuries B.c. At a spot called Angdna on the right bank of the Alpheus three kilometres west of Olympia a well-preserved classical building was excavated by Yialouris. It seems to have stood by the Sacred Road (see AM XXXVIII (1913), pl. IV), and is interesting in plan and construction. Finds here include fragments of a painted sima, an inscribed bronze weight, and other bronze and iron objects, with pottery of the sixth and fifth centuries B.C. An interesting Mycenaean burial mound was discovered by peasants at the foot of a hill in a place called Klidhi by ancient Samikdn (Samia). The peasants in their ignorance had largely destroyed the mound; but Yialouris was able to examine the lower levels, and recover about 150 vases. The mound was 5 m. in diameter, composed entirely of the sand of that region, held in place round the edge by a wall of rough stones o60o m. high. The ten or more burials inside the mound were in three layers one above the other. Yialouris notes that not only is a burial mound of the Mycenaean period most unusual, but the vases found here are older than any other Mycenaean vases that have yet come to light in the western Peloponnese. Mycenaean sherds on the hill above the mound may indicate the site of the settlement. In the shallow lake near by it is possible to dis- tinguish the ruins of many buildings of the lower city of ancient Samik6n, together with part of the city walls running down from the acropolis to the sea. An Attic red-figure lekythos of the late fifth century B.c. was found at Samikdn, and three black glaze lekythoi at Anemokhdrio. What appears to be a deposit of classical and Hellenistic vases has been noted at Karnesi Krestdinon. Many coins of all periods are reported from the Kristaina area. Near Vresti between Z~akhos and Andhritsaina, Yialouris has recognised an unknown ancient city with the ruins of many buildings and defence walls; another ancient city lay near Modndriza. A hoard with thousands of small bronze coins, mostly Roman, was found in a pithos near Khdria Olinis. A tomb at Mdtesi near Andhritsaina produced a large Attic pyxis with a lid. At Kaldmai the new museum is being arranged with finds of all periods from the area. New inscriptions, mostly from graves, have been found in the region of Ithdme. The museum at Patras has been set in order. Yialouris examined a circular structure, evidently a tower of the ancient city wall, built with lime mortar and bits of tile in the joints between the stones, at the juncture of Pantanassa and Karaiskakis streets in Patras. From below the foundations fourth-century B.C. sherds were recovered. A tomb on Anemos hill in Ano Sikhaind outside Patras contained black-glaze vases of the late sixth century B.c. with an archaic terracotta statuette of a seated woman. Yialouris and others dug a late Mycenaean chamber tomb at Ayios Pandeleimon by Vrakhndika west of Patras. It contained two skeletons, with a couple of vases and a large number of glass paste beads from two necklaces. Other Mycenaean vases have already been found in this area. An inscribed slab and a marble sphinx of the Roman period came to light at a spot called Sarindiko near Drimds Vonitsa. A burial in a slab-covered grave here was accompanied by vases and terracotta figurines, together with a gold ring, and a bronze pin and part of a mirror. On the road from Kordndoi to Oiniadhoi a classical grave with an inscribed tombstone was uncovered. Work on the road from Kagddhito to Ridlo led to the discovery of a large Late Mycenaean ceme- tery consisting for the most part of little chamber tombs. These had a number of vases with an altogether peculiar style of decoration, bone beads from a necklace, and two bronze rings. One small intact tomb with two burials, one a woman and the other almost certainly a man, was dug by Yialouris and produced a necklace of gold and another of bone beads, a small glass plaque with plant decoration, a large bronze pin-head and spindle whorls, and an animal-shaped vase with several other vases. The inside of another larger tomb had been divided into compartments by means of stone walls. Yialouris also conducted excavations in the ancient city which may be Le6ntion or Tritaia (see Meyer, Pelopon. Wander. I I I) on the hill of Kastritsi Tis Vlasias, five kilometres along the road from Patras to Kalivrita. Outside one of the city gates were found interesting remains of the doors in the form of charred fragments of wood, together with sheets of iron plate and large heavy nails. At either side of the stone threshold were upwards of three notches for fastening the wooden door- frames, and the two bronze sockets in which the gateposts of the double doors had swung. The lower part of the gateposts had also been capped with bronze. Tower 9 (Meyer, op. cit., plan VI) of the city wall was cleared, and nine slab-covered Roman graves were uncovered. In the area of the Late Mycenaean cemetery excavated by IKyparissis outside Ldpesi two plun- dered chamber tombs were exposed by the rain. A third tomb, which had lain open for many years, was examined by Yialouris and produced a single skeleton with some vases. On a hill above As</page><page sequence="16">I8 M. S. F. HOOD the cemetery Yialouris reports traces of a Mycenaean settlement. He worked on the finds from his excavations of the previous year in Aigion, and put the collections there in order. These include Mycenaean vases and other objects, and classical sculpture, mostly from excavations before the War in this area. CENTRAL AND NORTHERN GREECE I. Threpsiades (A.S.) reports three inscribed grave stones, two of them with reliefs, from the region of the Megaili Krini at Plataia. At Orchomenos inscribed triangular bases of the Roman period were found covering later, probably Christian, graves when making a road between the Byzantine church and the archaeological area. Two Mycenaean tombs, one with very rich finds, including bronze daggers and a sword, came to light by the NE arm of the little harbour of Mikr6 Vathi near the cement works at Aulis. Threpsiades suggests that this may be the cemetery area of Mycenaean Aulis, since other Mycenaean tombs were found in this region some years ago when the cement works were built. Threpsiades examined the four entrance gates of the famous prehistoric citadel of Arne or Gla in the Copais basin. The west gate was almost entirely cleared, and the general plan was ascertained of the other gates on the north and south, and of the interesting double gate on the SE. Near one of the gates what may be the entrance of a tomb was identified, but has not yet been examined. Sherds, mostly of the L.H. III period, were recovered during the excavations, and should help in establishing a precise date for the city and its defences. Eretria. Miss I. Konstantinou (A.S.) continued the work begun three years ago on the temple of Apollo Daphephoros. A rectangular structure measuring 3-60 x 310o m. and built of large stones by the NE corner of the temple had a thick layer of ash with a few burnt animal bones and some Geometric sherds in the centre. Numbers of similar sherds were found by the east side of the struc- ture, and also an Egyptian statuette which apparently represents the god Nefer-toumou---and is assigned to the period ca. 600-550 B.C. This is evidently a structure which was already used in the Geometric period for sacred rites, and the altar of the first temple may have been built on top of it. About 90 m. south of the temple was a group of what appear to have been workshops. In one of these was found a quantity of potters' clay of the finest quality coloured different shades of yellow and red, together with a vase full of colouring materials. Another produced large lumps of slag from bronze smelting, and five bronze coins of the fourth or early third centuries B.C. Most of the sherds from this area belong to the same period. A building excavated many years ago east of the temple Miss Konstantinou suggests may be a fountain house. A small church, late Byzantine or early post-Byzantine, was cleared by Threpsiades at the foot of the castle on the site of the ancient city of Oreoi in North Euboia. A sarcophagus in the entry of the church produced a gold ring with a monogram which seems to read: 'Icw&amp;vvrS 'EiuKO'rro 2pE&amp;$v. The museum at Khalkis is being set in order. Aitolia and Akarnania. From the area of Skdla Napaktias Yialouris reports a stele with an inscrip- tion twelve lines long about the freeing of a slave which took place in the shrine of Asklepios at Krounoi. Near Khrisovitsa (ancient Koronta) in Akarnania were found two grave inscriptions and a group of tombs of the Hellenistic and Roman period with many vases. From the region of ancient Thyrrheion new inscriptions, mostly from graves, some built into walls in the village of Paliambela, others now in the school at Vonitsa. The work of cleaning and conserving the bronze and iron objects in the Collection at Agrinion has been taken in hand. The Collection has been enriched with many vases and terracottas, archaic and Hellenistic and later, from the district. Dodona. D. Evangelides (A.S.) excavated a small shrine running under the south side wall of the early Christian basilica church. Finds from this area included a small bronze lid with a dotted inscription round the rim, iron keys (L. o0 13 m.) of the Laconian type with four teeth, a small ox's head of green glass paste, and fragments of lead plaques with prayers inscribed on them. The most important objects recovered were a superb early archaic bronze figurine of a goat (L. 0o0o9 m.) with large horns, and an ornament in the shape of a lion (L. 0o0o33 m.) made of thin gold plate with the body and the face in relief, and the mane represented by little compartments (cloisons) filled with blue steatite. The lion appears to be Persian work of the sixth century B.c. At the back are small links, evidently for sewing it to some material. From two small and poorly built shrines in the SW part of the excavation area Evangelides recovered fragments of terracottas and lead plaques with oracular inscriptions. Other finds were a bronze handle terminating in a swan's head, a fragment of a small bronze head of Dionysos, and a piece of a bronze phiale with a dotted inscription. A limestone slab has an inscription about freeing a slave in the time of King Alexander. The finest object from here was a bronze statuette of a warrior (Ht. o I i m.) in pre-Daedalic style. He is wearing a triple ring girdle round his waist</page><page sequence="17">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE I9 and a conical helmet. In his left hand he carries a shield, while his right, which held a spear now missing, was raised above his head. Trials in the cavea of the theatre revealed that the central section of the bottom three rows of benches had been destroyed in the Roman period, and a plat- form about 2 m. high built to form an arena. Evangelides cleared part of the east gate of the acropolis. By the gate were traces of a stairway leading on to the wall. Another destroyed gate was identified in the southern section of the wall. Iodnnina. S. Dakares cleared two cist graves which may have belonged to the Byzantine town of Phreastana (modern Phrastani) west of Kdto Merdpi in the region of Pog6nion. An early Chris- tian basilica church 32 m. long and 24.50 m. wide with apse and side aisles was examined by Dakares an hour south of Kito Mer6pi at a spot known as Paliomondstiro on a ridge about ten degrees north of Lakhan6kastron. Arta. In Nikolios Blakhofitsis Street, Dakares reports, part of an ancient building came to light constructed of fine squared blocks with a pavement of large stone slabs. An edge tile of the FIG. 16.-GOLD EAR-RINGS FROM A FIFTH-CENTURY GRAVE AT KOUTSOMiTA NEAR ARTA. normal Corinthian type, with palmette and maeander decoration in the style of the first half of the fourth century B.c., apparently belonged to it. Near it was a little structure I- m. square containing about fifty miniature vases, lamps, jugs, and cups, etc., of fourth- and third-century types, evidently meant for toys or votives. Near the monastery of Kito Panayla at Arta a little temple-shaped tomb was uncovered by the stream of the Arakhthos. On the architrave was an inscription with the name of the dead man: HT7Warcov ETrEqaXvou Tl .... .io. The tomb dates from the fourth century B.C., to judge from the style of the lettering and the pair of red-glaze oinochoai found in it. Dakares excavated twenty-seven tombs, some with very rich finds, in the ancient cemetery at Koutsomita SE of Arta. The earliest of these were eight cist graves built of large slabs of limestone and nine ordinary earth graves, all dating from the first half of the fifth century B.C. One of the cist graves with the burial of a woman produced a pair of fine gold earrings with palmettes above and buds dangling from them on chains (Fig. 16), a couple of silver ornaments in the form of scarabs, with figures of a winged victory in repouss6, a sealstone of rock crystal in a setting of silver with a superb engraving of a bull, two bronze mirrors, and two bronze rings engraved with pictures of Eros stretching his bow, together with a black-figure lekythos and an alabastron: these are assigned to the second quarter of the fifth century B.C. Four cremation burials seem to be a little later in date; one in a plain amphora, another in an early-fourth-century pelike with a scene of a woman sitting on a bench and other women bearing water to her, and the remaining two in bronze hydriae. These ash containers had been placed in pits covered by very thin slabs of white stone. Traces of the funeral pyres were identified near them. The other graves excavated belonged to the Hellenistic period. Dakares continued excavations at Kassdpi. The last two rooms of the interesting inn building (see JHS LXXV Suppl. 13, etc.) were cleared. In one of them was found the upper part of a life-</page><page sequence="18">20 M. S. F. HOOD sized Hellenistic marble torso of a man wearing a thin chiton with a cloak of some thick material over his left shoulder. The east half of the great stoa, 63 m. long and over I m. wide, south of the inn has been uncovered. Its walls are built in the same way as those of the inn, but with less care: the lower part consists of polygonal masonry, the upper of burnt bricks with a frame-work of wooden beams. The stoa is double, with a row of twenty-seven Doric columns on the open south side, and thirteen square pilasters inside. The columns are made of poros stone coated with plaster. Many fragments of the capitals and of the entablature were recovered. It seems that there were three triglyphs and three metopes between the columns. The ornamental end-tiles found last year with representations of the rape of Ganymede evidently came from the roof of this stoa. The tiles are assigned by their style to the second half of the fourth century B.C., and the building of the stoa must date from this period or the very earliest Hellenistic times. At all events, it is later than the inn, which appears to have been constructed in the first half of the fourth century B.C. In front of the stoa was found a row of twelve bases, four of them bow-shaped semicircular apses, on which statues and inscriptions had once stood. A bronze coin from this area is apparently unique: it has a head of Dionysos and the name of an archon [I]JKPATHE on one side: on the other is inscribed i l J + 5 iP u. p. 15 FIG. I 7.-SHERDS FROM EARLY DEPOSIT AT PALAI6POLIs DATING FROM THE TIME OF THE COLONISATION OF KERKYRA. KAZZQ-TIAIIQN inside an oak wreath. A prehistoric sherd with relief decoration and a fragment of a perforated stone axe point to the occupation of the site long before the foundation of the classical city. Kerkyra. B. Kallipolitis (A.S.) continued excavations at Palaidpolis on the north side of the modern church which occupies the nave of the early Christian basilica. It appears that the basilica had double aisles each side of the nave. The foundations of an earlier wall, used as the stylobate for the row of columns dividing the two northern aisles, turned out to form the chord of a large semicircular apse about 40 m. in diameter. This curious apsidal building appears to date from the early Hellenistic period, and Kallipolitis suggests that it may have been a place of assembly, a Prytaneion or Bouleuterion. Various inscriptions previously found in the area confirm this view. A most important discovery was a pure undisturbed layer at a deeper level north of this Hellenistic building containing pottery of the late Geometric and early -Protocorinthian periods (Fig. 17), which may therefore date from the time of the traditional colonisation of Kerkyra by the Corinthians under Chersikrates in 734 B.C. (Strabo VI 269). Kallipolitis emphasises the significance of this find for its bearings on the related problems of the colonisation of Syracuse and Kerkyra, and the dating of late Geometric and early Protocorinthian wares. Thessaly. The museum at Vdlo was badly damaged during the earthquakes of April last year, but the antiquities in it have escaped harm. An inscription with an honorary decree of the fourth or third century B.c. drafted in the local dialect was recovered from ancient Krannon. G. Soteriou</page><page sequence="19">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 21 (A.S.) continued work at Christian Thebes (Nea Ankhialos) SW of V61o. Much of the main avenue of the ancient city cut by the modern V6los-Almir6 road has now been uncovered. It is nearly 3'50 m. wide, paved with large slabs of reddish stone. Two large houses were cleared on the north side of it, and a row of eight on the south side, some of which were clearly shops or work- shops: drains from them lead to the great slab-covered main drain of the city, which runs down to the sea. A short distance from the avenue were the public Baths of the city, which were evidently built during the Roman period, but continued to function into Christian times, although not all parts of them were still in use then. The stoa on the east side of the large Basilica (A) at the end of the avenue has been almost entirely cleared. The columns had fine Ionic capitals of fifth-century A.D. date. Part of an extensive cemetery outside the stoa was examined. It contained family graves contemporary with the Basilica, together with later slab-covered single graves dating from a period after its destruction in the eighth century A.D. The family graves provide an interesting illustration of the burial customs, including funeral feasts, practised at the time. At the west side of the graves was a stele about o085 m. high, with a large cross in relief and a rectangular hollow on its upper surface, in front of which was set a round marble basin o050 m. in diameter (Fig. 18). The many finds last year included early Christian clay lamps and sealstones, interesting iron implements and hunting weapons, and Christian grave and dedicatory inscriptions, together with others of the Hellenistic and Roman periods used as building material. N. Verdelis (A.S.) found three more large early built tombs east of the archaic Greek tholos tomb at Pharsala (JHS LXXIV 158). One 4 m. square originally had a roof which sloped upwards FIG. I8.-EARLY CHRISTIAN FAMILY GRAVES BY BASILICA (A) AT CHRISTIAN THEBES. on all four sides to a central point. The tomb contained a poros sarcophagus, plundered and empty except for scraps of bone; but a number of Attic kylikes and lekythoi of the second half of the fifth century B.c. found inside the tomb give the date of the burial. Ten metres farther east was a second tholos tomb 4 m. in diameter with a dromos I-8o m. long and between 1-6o and 1i85 m. wide on the north side. The tomb had been almost entirely destroyed, but in it were found ten square poros bone-cists, one of them with the name of the dead woman, AFATlA, engraved on its lid. The style of the letters points to a date at the beginning of the fifth century B.c., and many fragments of large Attic black-figure vases were recovered from the tholos and its dromos. It appears that the tomb was built at the end of the sixth or the beginning of the fifth century, and is therefore more or less contemporary with the other archaic tholos tomb. About 100 m. to the east was a second 4-m.-square tomb, also much destroyed, with nothing but a few vase fragments, some of the fifth century B.c. Beside it were found two marble door-jambs and a pediment, which may have be- longed to it. Part of a grave relief, good provincial work of the late fifth century B.c., shows an old man seated on a chair. Verdelis also made a small trial on the NE slope of the adjoining ridge of Fetih-Tzami to identify the site of the Mycenaean city, following the previous discovery of three Mycenaean tombs in the area. From Homer it appears that Pharsalos was the leading city of Phthia, and Stahlin long ago conjectured that the Mycenaean acropolis must lie upon this ridge. The trial indicated occupation here without interruption from the Neolithic B period onwards. At Ldrisa Verdelis (A.S.) made excavations at the junction of Papakiriazis and Roosevelt streets in the NW corner of the Post Office square after the discovery during building operations of architec- tural fragments and large poros drums from Doric columns. A row of bases for honorary statues was exposed along the east side of a massive foundation which continued under Roosevelt street</page><page sequence="20">22 M. S. F. HOOD and the houses west of it (Fig. I9). The building to which the foundation belonged, and which appears to date from the fourth or third centuries B.c., was clearly in the Agora of the ancient city, and may be the Temple of Kerdoan Apollo, before which stood honorary statues and decrees. The fragments of inscriptions recovered mostly come from the statue bases. A bronze horse's hoof evidently belonged to an equestrian statue. A trial excavation financed by the Town Council in Demeter Street on the east edge of the castle at LArisa brought to light a large fourth-century marble dedicatory stele (height 2-65 m.), inscribed TTOTEIAQNI KPANAIQI TIYAAIQI. The stele stood at the beginning of the road from Lirisa to Tempe. P. Milojcid excavated the settlement mound of Otzdki-Magodla near Lairisa for the German Archaeological Institute. The site was abandoned towards the end of Neolithic times. The latest deposits have suffered much from agriculture and erosion; but considerable relics of the latest periods of occupation were recovered, mostly from store pits dug into the earlier levels. Three groups of material belonging to these latest periods could be distinguished: (I) What seem to be the latest deposits of all produced encrusted ware (F1y and "Fi). (2) There are deposits in which a black-polished ware (Fica I, 2, 3) prevails, accompanied by a polychrome ware (B3y), a black on a whited slip-painted ware (B3a3), and a peculiar black on a red slip-painted ware. Milojvid notes that there is throughout these deposits a complete absence of spiral or maeander motives. (3) Pure Dhimini ware (B3c2), together with the accompanying polychrome ware (B33), came from a not altogether clear stratigraphic context outside the main area of the excavation. The pits Fri. 19.-Row or STATUE BASES OUTSIDE FOUNDATIONS OF POSSIBLE T'EMPLE OF APOLLO AT LARISA. in which encrusted ware predominated were dug into deposits containing pure Dhimini ware, those with the black-polished ware into the levels of the latest Sesklo culture. Three successive and clearly distinguished levels of the Sesklo culture produced much pottery of different A3 wares, together with remains of houses, including some with a framework of posts sunk upright in the earth. The houses of the latest Sesklo level were comparatively small rectangular mud-brick struc- tures. Below the houses of the earliest Sesklo culture were several metres depth of deposit in which no mud-brick walls could be detected. In this pre-Sesklo deposit a ware with ' cardium' shell and finger-nail incisions follows a ware with finger-tip impressions, pinches, and furrows; earliest of all appears to be a pottery assemblage with nothing but monochrome wares. The abundant idols from these pre-Sesklo levels have nothing at all in common with the well-modelled figurines of the Sesklo culture. Beneath these earliest pre-Sesklo deposits with unpainted pottery there appeared surprisingly enough levels which were again characterised by painted wares, cherry-red fabric with a white slip, or painted decoration immediately on a polished surface. The figurines also were of a different type; in place of the strongly stylised figurines of the pre-Sesklo levels, carefully made ' naturalistic ' figurines more like those of the Sesklo culture were found. Moreover, remains of mud-brick houses, as in the Sesklo culture, again came to light in these lowest levels. Milojqid notes that under these houses were traces of buildings constructed with posts, from which it appears that this type of building construction was in use throughout the Neolithic period in Greece. Besides the painted pottery there were bowls of' black-topped ' ware, with the whole of the inside and just the top of the rim on the outside black, while the rest of the outside below the rim is cream-coloured. The painted</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 23 pottery from these earliest levels is sharply distinguished in colour, fabric, and ornament, from Sesklo ware, and is reminiscent of the early pottery from Erimi in Cyprus and of other early painted wares of the Near East. MACEDONIA AND THRACE At Salonica trial excavations by Kh. Makaronas on the south side of the ' Octagon ' brought to light part of a large circular structure with a diameter of about 14 m. inside. This seems to have been built in early Christian times as a baptistery after the ' Octagon ' became a church. Later it was converted into a cistern. M. Andronikos reports a hoard of 380 Hellenistic silver coins from the region of Jigrita recovered by the police from an antique dealer and brought to Salonica museum. The coins include tetradrachms, didrachms, and drachms of Alexander, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Athens. In searching the house of the antique dealer the police came upon many bronze bow-fibulae of Geometric and post-Geometric times, all evidently from Macedonia. Ph. Petsas excavated two rock-cut chamber tombs which came to light in building new houses at Beroia. One had a dromos leading to a double chamber with recesses and niches. The entrance fagade was coated with plaster with traces of painted decoration in red, white, and blue. The tomb had evidently been plundered, perhaps in the Middle Ages, to judge from sherds of fourteenth- century Byzantine pottery found in it. But many of the original grave goods of the Hellenistic period remained: terracotta figurines (Figs. 2o, 21), clay pyxides, lamps, and tear bottles. The Fro. 20.-TERRACOTTAS FROM f-TEI,LENISTIC TOMB AT BEROIA. FiO. 21 .-TERRACOTTAS FROM HELLENISTIC TOMB AT BEROIA. other tomb had a single chamber and a short, steep dromos with the entrance fagade plastered and decorated as in the first tomb. Round the three sides of the chamber away from the entrance ran a bench, upon which the grave goods had been placed: a silver pin, pyxides with sphinx-shaped feet, and busts in relief on the lids, lamps, tear bottles, and other vases. A circular pit contained a small marble sarcophagus with the half-burnt bones of a child, a girl to judge from the gilded-clay ornaments found with her. Near by some architectural fragments with painted decoration from a tomb with a temple-like fagade of the ' Macedonian' type were recovered. This tomb, from the style of the architecture, Petsas suggests may be earlier than most if not all of the known tombs of this kind. Bits of the pediment from another ' Macedonian' tomb were found in the same area. The Archaeological Society has repaired the magnificent 'Macedonian' tomb excavated by Sotiriades in 1929 at Dion. Makaronas (A.S.) examined the ' Macedonian ' tomb found by chance some three years ago at Karitsi near Dion (Fig. 22). The tomb, dating from the end of the third or the beginning of the second century B.c., is really a small and simple version of the great ' Mace- donian' tombs with temple-like fagades. It had never been plundered, and contained the single burial of a girl about fourteen years old, accompanied by a plain gold ring, a bronze mirror, two bronze phialai, a glass kantharos-shaped vase, and a clay lamp. The plain pedimented fagade, just over 3 m. wide and not much higher, had a square door which opened directly into the burial chamber. The floor of the chamber was paved with a mhosaic of natural river pebbles, all yellowish except for a circle of black pebbles in the middle. At the end opposite the entrance was the couch for the dead built of stone coated with plaster in imitation of the marble couches of the great ' Mace- donian ' tombs like those at Dion and Pydna. The entrance of the tomb was blocked by four large stones, but there had been a wooden door inside these as well.

Hermes is looking back towards the warrior, while he moves to the right, where on the opposite side of the door of the tomb are depicted the judges of Hades, Aiakos and Rhada- manthys.

An interesting find, although not connected with the tomb, is part of an inscription on a fragment of marble recording the sale of properties and mentioning, apart from the buyers and sellers, priests, captains, judges, witnesses, and others. Some of the people cited are Skydraioi. D. Lazarides (A.S.) reports a fourth-century red-figure krater from the region of Oriskeia (Serrai). On one side is the protome of a horse with the head of a woman and a griffin, while two youths face each other across a stele on the other. Three Roman graves were found in making a road at Amphipolis. One had a pair of gold ear-rings with figures of flying Victories. A Roman tomb at Philippi yielded thirteen glass vases of different shapes and a number of tear bottles. The head of a statue of a youth from Philippi may be a portrait of Lucius Caesar. Treasure-seekers at</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 25 'Gaidhour6kastro ' near Karianis, the site of the Thasian colony Galepsos, came upon two cremation burials inside bronze urns. One was accompanied by a fine black-figure krater, with a picture of Dionysos waving a kantharos and mounting a chariot on one side, and dancing Nymphs and Silens on the other. With the other burial was an Attic fifth-century black-glazed kylix. Some fine fragments of red- and black-figure vases were found in building operations on the site of the ancient city of Neapolis at Kavala. Lazarides (A.S.) continued the work begun in 1950 at Abdera. Trials were made in the western part of the ancient city, where the year before layers of the classical and archaic periods came to light for the first time. Part of a building of the fourth century B.c. was uncovered. Another building, assigned to the Hellenistic period, may have been a shrine of Cybele, to judge from a relief and a clay bust of that goddess found in it. A third building produced an early mosaic pavement of unusual interest (Fig. 23). It is 3-60 m. long and 1.30 m. wide, with a central design consisting of pairs of facing dolphins with lily blooms rising between them. Each group of dolphins and a lily FIG. 24.-RESTORATION OF INTERIOR OF ARSINOEION IN SAMOTHRACE MUSEUM. is separated from the next by a large rosette with eight pointed petals. This unique mosaic floor Lazarides suggests may be a little older than the mosaics in the ' House of the Masks ' at Delos, and can therefore be assigned to the second half of the third century B.c. AEGEAN ISLANDS The excavations of the French School in Thasos were continued by G. Roux, F. Salviat, and Chr. Dunant. The stylobate and most of the back wall of the SW Portico in the Agora have now been cleared. An archaic ' eschara' composed of three orthostats was found at a depth of I m. below the 'Passage of the Theoroi'. A fragment of a stele with a letter of Rhodes refers to the honours decreed to the Thasian Dionysodoros, son of Pempides. In Samothrace K. Lehmann reports that the site of the Sanctuary of the Great Gods was set in order, and the Museum built by New York University was officially given to the Greek Government and opened to the public. The Museum houses the finds from the excavations, together with partial architectural reconstructions of the most important buildings (Fig. 24), and the sculpture from the A4</page><page sequence="24">26 M. S. F. HOOD Sanctuary sent by the Louvre in exchange for the hand and other fragments of the Winged Victory. Tombs were found in levelling the ground for the new Guest House on the site of a cemetery of the sixth to second centuries B.C., west of the ancient town. The burials here throughout the fifth century B.C. are all cremations; the Hellenistic all inhumations. In the fourth century both cremations and inhumations occur. Finds last year included terracotta figurines of a boy in a chlamys (Fig. 25), with Hellenistic pottery and lamps. At Kariotis, a few miles east of the ancient town, A. Vavritsas has identified a prehistoric settlement. Hand-made pottery of Early Bronze Age type was found on the surface here. Samos. E. Buschor continued the excavations of the German Institute at the Heraion. A sound- ing in depth north of the great temple beyond the temenos wall came upon the prehistoric settlement at a relatively high level. Clearing the foundations of the so-called Aphrodite Temple and the space in front of it brought to light prehistoric walls below a floor of the pre-Rhoikos period, which underlay the late archaic fill deposited in raising the level of the sanctuary when Rhoikos extended FIG. 25.-TERRACOTTA FIGURINES OF BOYs WEARING A CHLAMYS FROM THE CEMETERY AT SAMOTHRACE. it. An excavation in depth in the east part of the so-called South Building produced rich deposits of vases and objects, especially of the seventh century B.c. These included a wooden plate, an ivory cup, a fragment of an ornamented marble goblet, bronzes, notably a griffin and the upper part of an Egyptian mirror-bearer, and a large haul of complete vases, including an amphora with a plastic head. There were also imported Protocorinthian lekythoi and Laconian aryballoi. Excavations inside the sanctuary area yielded a deposit of Geometric and Cypriot terracottas and other objects of the period of the first temple. Yialouris has noted an enclosure wall with a building inside it assigned to the fourth century B.C. at a place called Kidhro six kilometres from Limin Vatheos on the way to Koukari in Samos. A fine inscribed marble grave relief of the late fourth century B.c., depicting a funeral feast, was also found here. Hellenistic terracotta figurines of Apollo with a lyre were recovered from Misdkambos. Built into a well-head at a place called Ai-LAri by the sea at Mis6kambos, Yialouris has noted a block of marble with a Stoichoidon inscription: FO. . OAQPI2 / KAEQNAIO.

Kondoleon discovered an acropolis with occupation at least as early as archaic times above the ancient city of Thermi (modern Th6rma) near Kataphi~ion (Figs. 26, 27). Kondo- leon notes that an interesting grave relief was found in this region some years ago. It dates from about 470 B.C., and the subject recalls the relief of Ino-Leukothea in the Villa Albani at Rome.</page><page sequence="26">28 M. S. F. HOOD On the lower border is an inscription in Parian characters with the signature of the artist: TTAAION [T-AP]ID2 EITITHIEEN. In the upper right-hand corner is another inscription with names. Tombs with mounds over them dating from the beginning of the fifth century onwards appear on each side of the road which leads from the acropolis to the north through Kataphiyion. In Tenos Kondoleon (A.S.) continued work in the city on the heights of Xdbourgo, which may be the main city of the island in early times, the polis as opposed to the astu. The astu, distinct from the polis according to inscriptions, would be the city by the sea near the modern town of Tenos, which was certainly the capital of the island from the fifth or fourth century B.C. onwards. More of the defence walls on the west of the city at X6bourgo were laid bare. Outside this section of the walls the ruins of many houses came to light. A cemetery of the fifth century B.C. was found at a place Vardhalakos. Here two pithos burials were exposed just above a retaining wall, at the foot of which were six stele bases and fragments of a grave relief of a man with a cloak. This relief, although incomplete, is a fine example of an island grave stele of the first half of the fifth century B.C. A fragment of a clay plaque from here has a picture in relief of a chariot drawn by a pair of winged beasts, and driven by a goddess who is wearing a polos crown (Fig. 28). Kondoleon notes that this plaque shows that the technique of relief decoration was not confined to vases. The head FIG. 28.-FRAGMENT OF CLAY RELIEF PLAQUE WITH GODDESS DRIVING A CHARIOT DRAWN BY WINGED BEASTS FROM TENOS. FIG. 29.-SLAB WITH RELIEF OF THE FORE-PART OF AN Ox FROM THE ARCHILOCHIEION IN PAROS. of a clay statue of a man is assigned to the end of the eighth century B.C. A miniature black-glaze clay shield has a copy of the head of the Athena Parthenos of Pheidias. Other finds from here include fragments of relief amphorai, and graffitos on sherds of the sixth century B.C. A slab in Pdros Museum with a relief of the fore-part of an ox has been recognised by Kondoleon as coming from the frieze of the Archilocheion (Fig. 29). The scene must refer to the ox which Archilochos gave the Muses in return for the lyre according to the story of the inscription (AE 1952, 32 f.). Archilochos and the Muses were no doubt represented on the adjoining slabs. From the style of the relief Kondoleon thinks it probable that this frieze was carved after the foundation of the building, and belongs to the period of its restoration by Sosthenes in the first century B.C. Behind the church of the Katapoliana in the city of Piros Kondoleon cleared the wall of a building con- structed with squared stones, and recovered Geometric and other sherds. A small figure of Victory with the head missing, work of the late fifth century, was rescued from a wall in Antiparos. In Kos A. Orlandos (A.S.) made investigations to complete the plan of the basilica church dug some years ago at Mastikhdri. The out-building along the south side of the church itself was found to consist of three compartments, one containing an altar supported on four legs. This and the compartment next to it had fine mosaic floors with dedicatory inscriptions. I.

Sacred caves by the Sanctuary were also investigated, but only the upper levels with late Roman remains were cleared. The work of restoring the bombed west portion of the Museum in the Hospital of the Knights has continued. The wall of the Knights and some of the gates have been repaired. CRETE It has been another year of rich developments in Crete. In the museum at Herakleion the Scientific Exhibition upstairs is now in order, as well as the Tourist Exhibition. The Ayia Triaidha sarcophagus has been cleaned, and some of the frescoes from Knossos and other sites cleaned and restored. A Guide to the museum in English is available.

FIG. 30.-SHRINE WITH ALTAR RESTING ON THREE SUPPORTS IN LATE MINOAN HOUSE AT KATSAMBA. At Katsambd east of Herakleion, S. Alexiou (A.S.) began systematic excavations on the site of the Minoan harbour town of Knossos. The rich and important group of Late Minoan tombs dug by Alexiou during the last few years lay on the southern edge of this town. (I) A Late Minoan house contained an interesting domestic shrine on the west side of a large hall paved with rectangular stone slabs. The shrine was a little triangular room with an altar composed of a stone slab resting on three stone supports (Fig. 30). On the floor in front of the altar lay two pipe-like objects with snakey handles, resembling those found in other Cretan sanctuaries (Gaizi, Gournia, Agia Triadha), and thought to be dwellings for the sacred house snake or vases for libations in some Chthonic cult. Beneath the altar was an incense burner with other vases and handleless cups. Pumice stones were strewn round the entrance to the shrine. North of the large hall was a bathroom with a pavement of schist slabs, and a strew of beach pebbles before. the door. The bath-tub was still in place; a slab-covered clay channel carried the waste water away into the courtyard of the house. South of the large hall was a storeroom containing four pithoi with relief rope decoration and other vases. This storeroom had two floor levels, an earlier of beach pebbles with a later of schist slabs above. From the pottery it appears that the house was built during L.M. III B and repaired in III C. (2) Part of a great house of the Middle Minoan period came to light in consequence of building operations near here. Finds of sealings and of sealstones at a spot formerly called 'Anemomilia' (Windmills) led Sir Arthur Evans to place the centre of the harbour town in this area. The house appears to have been destroyed towards the end of M.M. III B about 16oo B.C. The floor at a</page><page sequence="28">30 M. S. F. HOOD depth of 3"io m. below the modern surface was paved in places with large slabs of gypsum and schist. Above it were found many M.M. III vases, together with fragments of frescoes. On top of the house were L.M. III buildings with pottery of L.M. III B date. Between the Middle and Late Minoan levels Alexiou identified an intermediary horizon with fine ' Palace Style ' sherds. A large amount has been spent on consolidating the fabric of the Palace at Knossos. Additional parts of the building have been given concrete roofs, and floors of stone slabs or concrete have been restored. The yellow paint indicating wood is being replaced by a system of paint which shows wood grain. In the course of the restoration work many sherds and complete vases were recovered. From a wall on the NE side of the Palace came an interesting fragment of a miniature fresco, assigned to L.M. I A, with a representation of a chariot. The reins and the whip with the face and dress of the charioteer can be distinguished. Other pieces of fresco include a fragment from the miniature fresco of the Tripartite Shrine (PM III 46, Col. Pl. XVI), showing women seated on a veranda. Three deposits with M.M. I B sherds were cleared by the Theatral Area: one contained bell-shaped figures, some of them very large; another phallus-like objects. Below the floor in one of the maga- zines of the west wing were kaselles not dug by Evans containing pottery of the beginning of the Middle Minoan period. Restoration work continued at Tylissos (A.S.). The excavation of the newly discovered L.M. III stoa was completed, and its east end discovered. It is much larger than was at first supposed, with a bench along the back wall. S. Marinatos (A.S.) and H. Brunstig resumed work on the great Minoan villa at Vathipetron near Arkhinis, south of Knossos. More of the unique Minoan potters' kiln of the sixteenth century B.c. was cleared. Trials were also made in the extensive Minoan city at Kdnli Kastilli (ancient Lykastos) west of Vathipetron, and the ruins of a large palace there were examined. In a spot called Kimbos at Andpolis Pedhiddhos Platon reports a tholos tomb with sarcophagi, which has not yet been excavated. At Chersdnisos on the coast east of Herakleion A. Orlandos (A.S.) excavated a large early Christian church assigned to the sixth century A.D. on the site of the little chapel of Ayios Nikolaos. The church has two aisles, a narrow narthex, and a square courtyard in front. The whole complex forms a rectangle nearly 19 m. wide and over 50 m. long, without reckoning the large five-sided apse which projects at the east end of the nave. On each side of the apse are rectangular compart- ments which correspond to the pastophoria in early Syrian churches. The floors of the narthex and of the nave were paved with interesting mosaics having complicated geometric designs. Let into the floor of the north end of the narthex was a rectangular marble slab with a border composed of alternate white and dark-blue slabs, having a circular hole in the middle, which may perhaps be compared with the libation receptacle in the tomb of the early Christian martyrion at Knossos (see p. 35)- Orlandos also examined the basilica church at Olotinta, where interesting mosaics with symbolic fishes and elaborate geometric designs had once been uncovered. In the region of the Minoan city west of the palace at Mallia, Platon reports the most interesting discovery of a seal-maker's workshop with sealstones in various phases of manufacture, and lumps of raw material, mostly green steatite, but including some rock crystal, etc. At a place called Patdles near Mele'ses a L.M. III shaft-grave was found containing two sarcophagi. At the spot known as Kastellos near Gorgoldini a circular building with bones and fragments of vases, including one Early Minoan askos-shaped vase, may be an early tholos tomb like those of the MesarA. What seems to be a similar tholos tomb is reported NW of Rizikas Monophatsiou. Two narrow gold bands from the region of Sivas Monophatsiou may also come from a tholos tomb. In making a road from Pirgos to Rotdsi at a place called Pharmakara an extensive Geometric cemetery came to light with mostly pithos burials like those at Arkhadds. An interesting early archaic inscription from here gives the name: 'ApKsoiaS. At Patdla by the church of Panayia Monophatsiou fragments of early Middle Minoan clay figurines may indicate a Peak Sanctuary. A Greek statuette of a seated goddess and many coins also suggest the existence of an ancient Greek city here. Platon examined an interesting archaic house in the region of ancient Lyttos with relief pithoi of the late seventh or early sixth century B.c. in situ. The pictures in relief include human figures, one of them an archer; a lion wounded by an arrow, and sphinxes. At Gonids Malevizou Platon made soundings in the place where last year a large Neolithic vase and a stone axe were discovered. A building with thick walls here may be Neolithic; but a small bronze knife with two rivet holes is assigned to Early Minoan times. Platon examined other sites in the area, notably what may be a 'Fort ' of the Middle Minoan period on a spur of the neighbouring mountain at Skamni; at Armi toii Phofiski and A16ni toti Photiski an extensive settlement with Middle Minoan and Late Minoan sherds; Late Minoan buildings in the region of the Megaron of Sklav6kambos; traces of a settle- ment and a long stretch of wall at M6si toii K~imbou or Xidhi; near Gonids remains of a building with pithoi of the Late Minoan period. At Pldtanos in the spot by Tholos A, which two years ago</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 31 produced about twenty stone vases, Platon found a small chamber containing over 400 stone and clay vases assigned to early Middle Minoan times. Phaistos. The excavations of the Italian School under D. Levi have again been attended with brilliant results. The orthostat facade of the earliest Palace, facing on to a slab pavement, was traced towards the south. It is exactly similar in appearance to the fagade which, at a height of 6 m. above it, looks on to the West or Theatre Court, forming the front of what was hitherto regarded as the First Palace. At the most southerly point of the excavations a stairway leads to a paved rectangular room (LIX) with benches round it, clearly a hall or waiting-room for visitors. Cups and lamps of clay and alabaster were found in a cupboard let into its north wall. Levi notes that Late Mycenaean houses were built right on the edge of the calcestruzzo (cement) covering the remains of that part of the so-called First Palace after its destruction. The finds from these houses appear to belong to the period of transition from the latest Mycenaean or sub-Mycenaean to Proto- geometric. Some steps lead from Room LIX to another room (LX) which also had benches. On the benches, or by them on the floor, were vases of different kinds, among them one of the type regarded by Evans as bird-nesting-boxes (PM II 3o6, fig. 177), and one in the form of an open pipe with two projecting feet or horns, which he thought might be a wool container (PM II 3o8, fig. 179), but which Levi suggests is more likely to be a ritual vase. Vast numbers of fine vases with an extra- ordinary wealth and variety of decoration were recovered from other rooms of this earliest Palace. On the inside of one shallow bowl are painted two figures of women dancing by an image of the Serpent Goddess. Two soundings under the pavement of the Latest Palace, (i) in the Central Court, (2) in the spacious colonnade (25) leading to the Central Court from the Magazine Quarter, revealed the same succession of phases as the newly excavated wing, together with a large quantity of fine vases. A second slab pavement about o-i o m. below the latest pavement in Room 25 confirms the existence of two periods in the Late Minoan Palace as determined in 1950. But the most remarkable find of the season belongs again to the earliest phase of the First Palace. In association with characteristic pottery, including vases of polychrome Kamares ware, were several thousand lumps of burnt clay vase stoppers: about 2,000 of these preserved clear impressions of some 200 different seals, which display the most varied designs, including representations of animals, and a couple of pictures of human beings. Levi notes the interesting fact that among these impressions are types of the earliest primitive glyptic repertory, side by side with hieroglyphic signs of Middle Minoan, and types of a more advanced art which anticipates the naturalism of the beginning of the Second Palaces. With the sealings were found three button seals and a couple of dozen inscribed tablets bearing signs that are still largely hieroglyphic, although some of them already approximate to the style of the Linear A script. On the east slope of the acropolis at Gortyna the Italian School completed the excavation of the terrace with the altar. Many more interesting votive objects of various types were recovered. The lower part of a large limestone statue of a seated woman assigned to the seventh century B.c. pre- served traces of vivid red decoration on the dress and belt. Soundings on the north slope of the acropolis proved that occupation here goes back to Neolithic times. Platon (A.S.) continued work on the Minoan building found last year near Zod in the region of Siteia. This appears to be a large and important country villa of the M.M. III B period, and is therefore contemporary with the large house already excavated by Platon near Siteia at Piskok6falo. The villa had evidently been destroyed by some catastrophe, probably the earthquake of ca. i6oo B.C. The plan of the villa is complex, and in places superimposed walls indicate two different periods of construction. Near the ruined village of Sfakid, about 45 minutes from Zoti, Platon (A.S.) examined a small tholos tomb with a circular chamber containing L.M. III sarcophagi and vases. A fine jasper seal- stone has a picture of the Minoan goddess flanked by winged griffins. At a spot called Patdla in the same neighbourhood was another tholos tomb with a rectangular chamber containing at least fifteen burials of the Protogeometric period. This produced an interesting series of some thirty vases, pins, and necklaces, with beads of glass paste and sard. On the summit of the height im- mediately above the tomb were traces of a small building of the M.M. III period. Platon concludes that it may be a small Peak Sanctuary from the character of the finds, which include a couple of triton shells and fragments of plastic vases apparently in the shape of bulls. In connection with these Platon notes that the owner of the land is reported to have found some years ago ' a clay lion the size of a small cat '. At Pandrmos between Herakleion and Rethymno K. Kalokiris (A.S.) continued work on the large basilica church. The big cistern measuring 6.65 x 5.65 m. in the courtyard in front of the church was cleared, and subsidiary buildings on the north and west sides of the church were examined.</page><page sequence="30">32 M. S. F. HOOD Platon (A.S.) went on clearing the large archaic house (A) in the ancient city which may be Phalanna at Onithd Gouledhiandn near Rethymno. The house is over 38 m. long and 16 m. wide. An interest- ing feature was stone supports for posts or columns in three of the rooms, four in one, six in another, and three in a row down the length of the third. Many vases were recovered from the house. Other discoveries in West Crete include a fine marble head of (?) Artemis from a spot called Virdhia in the region of Dhramia (ancient Hydramia). From a spot called Kapodh6ki in Ano Palaidkastro (ancient Polyrrhenia) Platon reports an interesting grave stele, coming from a tomb built of squared poros blocks fastened with iron clamps and lead. The stele has a relief of a woman sitting on a chair with a footstool and receiving the farewell of a man. Above are inscribed the names: TYPOI ZQAMEN 0 2X AMENOX OINQ2. Below the relief is a very interesting elegiac poem. In making a road at Xenotaphi in Rhodhovdni Selinou (ancient Elyros) four tombs were discovered. One had rich contents, including a fine fourth-century B.c. gold ear-ring with the head of a woman like one from Crete in the British Museum, a gold spindle-shaped bead, a bronze ring and mirror, a marble pyxis with a lid, and many vases. BRITISH EXCAVATIONS-CRETE Excavations were continued by the British School at Knossos during eight weeks of August and September in three main areas. (I) Ailias. In the Middle Minoan cemetery of Ailias, high on the slopes east of the Kairatos overlooking the Palace, two further tombs (VIII and IX) noted in I953 were cleared. This makes FIG.

FIG. 2.-MIDDLE MINOAN III CLAY COFFIN FROM TOMB VIII ON AILIAS, KNOSSOS. six tombs in all excavated in the cemetery since 195o, and work there has now been discontinued. Both the new tombs seem to have been in use, mainly at any rate, during the Middle Minoan III period. Tomb VIII, a large tomb of irregular plan, contained a single pithos burial at the far end of the main chamber, and some eighteen clay coffins (larnakes), mostly of oval shape and many of them with lids (Fig. I). One of the larnakes is painted red and elaborately decorated in developed M.M. III style with bands of running spirals and leafy sprays in white, with some detail in crimson (Fig. 2). Tomb IX had a number of burials above the floor, with remains of three larnakes, and a large spouted pithos painted black with a striking formalised plant design in white (Fig. 3). A deposit of burnt bones in the top level of burials in Tomb IX appears to represent the remains of one or more cremations. As the tomb had gone out of use before the end of the M.M. III period, this would be by some centuries the earliest example of cremation yet recognised in Crete.

Finds from both tombs, apart from vases, include seven sealstones, signets with stalks and len- toids, one of ivory, the rest steatite; a fragment of gold with a foliate band in repouss6, gold sequins and gold leaf, bronze pins and earrings, and beads. The unique series of clay coffins and burial jars from these and the other tombs already excavated have been mended. Dr. J. Trevor of the Duckworth Laboratory, Cambridge, began the study of the important skeletal remains. After Tomb IX had gone out of use and collapsed, a massive terrace wall faced with great blocks of squared stones was built across its front. The wall is destroyed to the south, but can be traced for more than ioo m. to the north. In character the wall resembles the series of great walls running roughly parallel to it on the lower slopes of Ailias. Part of one of these walls exposed in a gully was examined and produced a number of' mason's marks'. The walls may conceivably represent road terraces. A narrow built stairway was cleared in a steep bank about Ioo m. south of tomb VIII. (2) Gypsades. In a field on the far slopes of Gypsades, about ten minutes' walk beyond the southern boundary of the Minoan city, a collapsed tomb appeared in making a new vineyard and FIG. 3.-MIDDLE MINOAN SPOUTED PITHOS WITH STYLISED PLANT DECORATION FROM TOMB IX ON AILIAs, KNOSSOS. FIG. 4.-LATE MINOAN III A JUG WITH STYLISED ARGONAUT DE- SIGNS FROM TOMB ON GYPSADES, KNossos. was explored by us at the request of the Ephor of Antiquities, Dr. N. Platon. Tombs and larnax fragments had already been found in this area before and since the War; the whole extent of the newly planted vineyard was therefore examined. The eighteen tombs discovered, mostly chamber tombs but including three shaft-graves, were all of Late Minoan III date, except for one Middle Minoan. Most of the Late Minoan tombs only contained one or two burials in position, although several had evidently been used more than once. In the re-used tombs the bones of the earlier burials were normally pushed into a hole dug in the floor. There were a number of clay coffins, mostly plain, but two of them elaborately painted with spirals and papyrus and other flower motives. Traces of several wooden coffins were identified, together with two small wooden boxes, one containing remains of an ivory comb. About forty complete or nearly complete vases were recovered. Five assignable to L.M. III A are exceptionally fine, including a rhyton, a jug with stylised argonaut and fish designs (Fig. 4), and a stirrup vase with elaborate spiral frieze decoration (Fig. 5); all three of these were found together in the original collapsed tomb. Bronzes include a mirror, several single- edged knives, and leaf-shaped and chopper-type razors. One late (L.M. III C) tomb produced a number of vases, an iron knife with bronze rivets, and some large bronze pins. Four sealstones, from the position in which they were found, were apparently being used as beads or for their amuletic power rather than as signets.

Other finds include earrings and finger rings of bronze and silver, a faience figure-of-eight shield amulet, and heart- and bracket-shaped ornaments of glass paste, together with beads of glass, faience, gold, crystal, carnelian, and amber. The two amber beads from separate tombs are interesting in view of the extreme rarity of finds of Bronze Age amber in Crete to date.

The solitary Middle Minoan tomb was different in type from those on Ailias. It seems to have had a sunk forecourt, apparently open to the sky, separated by a massive blocking wall from a kidney-shaped chamber which contained the nine burials. Several of the bodies had evidently been sitting upright in a squatting position with their backs to the tomb wall. A large amount of pottery came from the fill of the tomb chamber and forecourt. With the burials were four small clay vases, a pair of silver earrings, and a small lentoid sealstone of hammered silver or meteorite like one found on Ailias in 1951, engraved in a fine style with a Cretan wild goat sitting above rocks.</page><page sequence="38">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 35 (3) New Sanatorium. An area was cleared of the early Christian Martyrion which came to light in 1953 in the Roman cemetery on the site of the new Sanatorium. The building consists of a central room or ' nave ', originally paved with marble slabs, and long galleries on at least three sides. These outer galleries, paved with mosaics, were partly exposed in 1953 (Fig. 6). Under the floor of the central 'nave' was a network of tombs in two layers-graves with stone-walled sides above, and simple tile-covered graves beneath them. Last year only graves already opened and plundered in early times were cleared. But in the bottom of one of the later series of walled graves with the remains of a skeleton was a coin of Constantine II as Caesar (A.D. 328). The earlier tile- graves may go back well into the third or second centuries A.D. It seems clear that the later walled graves, at any rate, are Christian. In the ' nave ' there had been a third and still later series of tombs built above the level of the floor. One of these, preserved intact in a corner of the room, had sides faced with slabs of coloured marble and the top adorned with a mosaic of opus alexandrinum; in the top is set a stone receptacle with a hole leading down into the tomb for libations (Fig. 7). The building seems to date from the seventh century A.D., the time of Heraclius, or later. But there are possible traces of an earlier and simpler structure which had preceded it. A party of swimmers under the leadership of J. Leatham with the supervision of Dr. Platon worked in Crete for three weeks of August using the aqualung equipment given to the School by the Sunday Times Newspaper the previous year. The Roman harbour works at Chers6nisos west of Mallia were planned and studied. The waters round Mochlos and the island of Pseira in the Gulf of Mirabello were also examined, and several complete clay vases of Early and Middle Minoan types were recovered from the depths of the sea there (Fig. 8). An interesting discovery at Chers6nisos and Mochlos were rock-cut compartments, apparently fish tanks of the Roman period, corresponding to the description of such tanks given by the agricul- tural writers Columella (VIII. 16, I f.) and Varro (III. 17, 2 f.). At Mochlos there were two, at Chers6nisos three of these in a row, clearly to keep different kinds of fish separate. The sea had been admitted through channels, usually more than one to a tank, to promote a free circulation of water. From one of the tanks at Mochlos came a fragment of a stone slab perforated with small holes, evidently part of a grill for such a channel preventing the escape of the fish while allowing the sea to enter. A search was made for the ancient wreck noted before the War at Ayia Galini on the north edge of the Messara Gulf (AE 1948-49, 'ApXatlo2XoylK XpoVIK&amp; 1-6). A fragment of lead plate which might have come from the hull of the vessel was recovered. M. St. F. HOOD The British School at Athens. BRITISH EXCAVATIONS-CHIOS The excavations of the British School at Empori6 in south Chios were continued by M. S. F. Hood and J. Boardman during six weeks ofJune and July 1955. Work was completed in the Early Bronze Age trenches at the foot of the hill which carries the Late Roman fortress. The trenches opened last year inside the fortress were taken down through two levels of Late Bronze Age houses with Mycenaean type pottery into the Early Bronze Age levels beneath them. From the Mycenaean levels several complete vases, bronze pins, and a knife blade were recovered. A small area was cleared of the Mycenaean buildings discovered in 1954 outside the Roman fortress walls on the south slope of the hill. These buildings had been destroyed by fire. Study of the finds from the archaic Greek town on Mount Prophetes Elias has shown that the settlement was abandoned about 600 B.c. and that the town and acropolis plan is virtually that of a seventh-century community. A body of Danish and Swedish students under Dr. M. Krustrup explored another of the houses and its approaches. Apart from this, little supplementary digging was conducted on the hill. Beside the harbour trenches were opened in the area between the Basilica Church and the sea, where archaic pottery and the foundations of a classical building had been uncovered the year before. These revealed that since about 800 B.c. there had been a flourishing sanctuary site beside the harbour. Of the earliest cult buildings nothing is preserved, but the position of a series of terrace walls, which supported the platforms for the buildings, was determined. The earliest walls flanked a roadway leading from the harbour and are dated to the eighth century. Early in the seventh century one at least of these walls was converted to act as a retaining wall for a terrace, and the roadway became thus a sunken ramp leading to the higher ground away from the shore</page><page sequence="39">36 JOHN BOARDMAN where the sanctuary must have stood. Soon after the middle of the seventh century a new terrace wall raised the level of the platform still higher, and the line of the old roadway was preserved by a flight of stone steps mounting through the terrace (Fig. I). About 6oo00 B.C. yet another terrace wall was constructed outside its predecessors; and the main approach was then blocked, and replaced FIG. I.-STEPS MOUNTING THROUGH TERRACE WALL OF SANCTUARY AT EMPORI6, CHIOS. FIG. 2.-NECK OF ARCHAIC VASE IN FORM OF A BULL'S HEAD FROM SANCTUARY DEPOSIT AT EMPORI6. by a curving entrance-way farther to the east, on the line of the modern path. A local extension of this terrace, built about 550 B.C., came to light in the main excavation trench together with some traces of house walls upon it. Pits containing late-sixth-century pottery close the sequence of these archaic deposits. The practice of burying in the fill of each new terrace wall the discarded votives of the sanctuary which preceded it has afforded six distinct deposits ranging in date from the eighth</page><page sequence="40">ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE 37 to the sixth century; and the presence of Corinthian or Attic pottery in the last four of them gives valuable dating evidence for their contents. Pottery comprises the bulk of the votives. Much of it is decorated, and nearly all of it is of Chian manufacture. From the eighth and early seventh centuries kraters are the commonest vessels, and they are decorated in a loose Late Geometric manner. Skyphoi carrying a decoration derived from Protocorinthian, perhaps via the Cyclades, develop through the seventh century into the characteristic Chian chalice shape. High-walled mugs and kantharoi are the other most FIG. 3.-ARCHAIC IVORY FIGURINE OF A HORSEMAN FROM SANCTUARY DEPOSIT AT EMPORIO. FIG. 4.-BRONZE BELT HANDLES FROM SANCTUARY DEPOSIT AT EMPORI6.

The most important example of the Chian wild-goat style of the late seventh century is a spherical oenochoe with animal friezes on the body, of which barely one-third is preserved. The neck of the vase is fortunately nearly complete and takes the unusual form of a bull's head, though the customary rotelles appear by the handle at the back (Fig. 2). Inscriptions on the pottery show that the deities worshipped in the harbour sanctuary include Apollo, Artemis, Hera, and Aphrodite. Two more fragmentary inscriptions were found on vases by the potter Nikesermos, who signed a chalice recovered in the preceding season (JHS LXXV Suppl., pl. IIe). Votives in other materials include many bronze fibulae, ear- and hair-rings, and some arrow- heads. A number of ivory spectacle fibulae were found in the seventh-century deposits, as well as the fragmentary ivory figurine of a horseman carved in a fine miniature style (Fig. 3): it measures</page><page sequence="41">38 JOHN BOARDMAN barely one inch in length. An ivory seal in the form of a couchant lion is of a type often met on East Greek sites. Bronze handles, whose arches resemble elaborate fibulae, were found attached to bronze belts. Of the two which appear on Fig. 4 the one on the left has terminals in the form of lions' heads. The presence of bronze belts has not before been attested on Greek sites, though now that the function of handles of this type has been determined it can be shown that they were known at Phanai in Chios and at Ephesus. Another bronze handle, from a bowl, carries a blossom on a stalk in the manner of many similar handles found elsewhere. In this example, however, the central bud-like feature of the blossom is replaced by the bearded head of a man with decisively modelled features (Fig. 5). A number of terracotta figurines of both Cypriot and Chian type were recovered, including the solid torso of a small kouros of the late seventh century, and a wheel-made horse decorated in a Mycenaean or sub-Mycenaean style, which may be an intruder in the area of the deposits. More was cleared of the clamped apsidal foundations of a classical building which in 1954 was found abutting on to the apse of the Basilica Church. It stands behind the archaic terraces in the area which the earlier sanctuaries must also have occupied. More architectural features have been recovered from the later Basilica, and it is now possible to reconstruct on paper the outlines of the classical building. It had four Ionic columns prostyle, of which are preserved two capitals and the torus moulding of one base. The anta capitals were found built into the Basilica apse as well as one of the anta bases. The last is an unusual feature, as it takes the form of a lion's paw (Fig. 6), a motif more commonly met on smaller objects like furniture or tripods, but which seems to have been applied to monumental architecture in Chios. Similar lions' paws of later date have been noted in Chios Museum and town. Most of the temple was built of Chian blue-grey marble, but white marble members were inlaid in the capitals, and there are other richly carved white marble mouldings which can probably be attributed to the same building. The date of the temple seems to be about the second quarter of the fifth century, which accords well with the fragments of a marble Apolline figure found in the previous year, and which could be from the cult statue. The lower foundations of the temple proved that it had been preceded in the sixth century by a circular or apsidal building of local stone. Various other mouldings found in the area of the temple and Basilica are from Hellenistic and Early Roman buildings of which no more could be learnt. A corbelled cistern constructed of squared blocks, which include a Hellenistic geison, is probably of the Early Roman period, which is otherwise represented by the mouldings just mentioned and some coins and pottery.
