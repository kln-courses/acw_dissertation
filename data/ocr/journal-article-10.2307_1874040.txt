<plain_text><page sequence="1">Medieval 969 Desmond Seward has us all in his debt. He has given us popular readable accounts of a great variety of subjects on which good modern books at that level are simply not available. He does his best to be up- to-date without sacrificing his main goal, to give a lively narrative, as uncluttered as possible by argu- ment and apparatus. Narrative history has not been very highly regarded in recent years. Few scholars can write it or bring themselves to write it. So it is good that Seward and his kindred rescue the genre from the hands of mere journalists. Readers of the American Historical Review, howev- er, will wish for a more scholarly appraisal. In this regard, Seward has indeed ignored a rather consid- erable amount of academic research and debate. In trying to avoid analysis and qualifications, he resorts sometimes to "perhaps," or to very general observa- tions such as "some historians differ." An example or two will serve to convey the level at which he is writing. On the subject of gunpowder and cannon, he describes vividly how and when it was used without posing the problem, recently raised by M. Vale in a contribution to C. T. Allmand's War, Literature and Society (1978), of whether its use at Harfleur by Henry V can be taken as marking a revolutionary change in warfare. Yet one feels that he has looked at the writing on the subject with a keen eye. With regard to naval warfare, he must score well for his use of C. F. Richmond (writing for K. Fowler's The Hundred Years' War [1971]), but he could have improved his story with proper use of Timothy Runyan's publications. His account of armies and their recruitment unduly emphasizes the role of commissions of array (following my own error, I fear), but, more serious- ly, he has not absorbed the message of A. E. Prince on the subject of numbers. He does balk at the worst exaggerations but so did many earlier scholars. Numbers for the 1340 and 1341 campaigns, for example, remain inflated. Reader, beware! It is to be expected that the handling of diplomat- ic aspects of warfare is less skillful in such a book than is that of battle and siege. Although listed in his bibliography, for example, J. J. N. Palmer's account of Richard II's peace negotiations is not used with much care and is even rather flagrantly ignored at times (for example on the proposals regarding the papal schism at the time of Richard's wedding to Isabella of France). The bibliography is useful, if highly selective. The main weakness lies in the listing of sources, where a concentration on translated versions would have been preferable given his likely readership. It is useful to be reminded, however, how poor is our record in translating medieval French historical material. MICHAEL R.

(Symposion der Akademie der Wissenschaften und der Literatur, 1980; Abhandlungen der Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften Klasse, number 4.) Wies- baden: Franz Steiner. 1982. Pp. xii, 208. DM 63. To an American readership, with its residual orien- tation toward Anglo-Saxon roots and perspectives, the Carolingian author and educator Hrabanus Maurus is probably best introduced as a disciple of Alcuin and a Beda Venerabilis in Teutonic sheep's clothing. Curiously, this severe figure at the dawn of a distinct German cultural tradition, who deeply influenced German learning and letters, has often been denigrated as a ponderous schoolmaster and, in the unfortunate phrase of E. R. Curtius, as "a tiresome compiler." The work of a number of medievalists over the last twenty-five years, almost exclusively in Germany, has done much to define more accurately Hraban's goals and methods and consequently to assess more fairly his historical achievement. In the present selection of papers, given at a commemorative symposium in 1980, the introduc- tory and concluding essays, by Franz Brunholzl and Josef Fleckenstein respectively, summarize this re- vised picture of Hraban, as an important commen- tator on the Scriptures who wanted to offer not new interpretations but abundant information; an ency- clopedist in the manner of Isidore of Seville who adopted an original principle of organization and pursued his own peculiar objective, to arrive at the underlying meaning of things; a poet of consider- able technical virtuosity; a teaching abbot who made his monastery of Fulda a center for copying ancient and ecclesiastical texts and educated several impor- tant authors; a scholar whose life's work helped assure the survival of Carolingian learning when the political and administrative structures of the empire crumbled; and one of the essential links with the classical tradition for both scholastics and humanists. The remaining essays in this volume contribute at least in part to the foundations for such an assess- ment. Eckhard Freise and Franz Staab review the basic chronological data that are still in question: Hraban's year of birth (the evidence for 780, it is shown here, does not exist) and of his joining the community in Fulda, apparently 788. On the other hand, Karl Schmid is able to add to an understand- ing of Hraban's spirituality from an examination of the Fulda necrologies, whose edition and study he has initiated. And John M. McCulloh's analysis of Hraban's martyrology gives one a better grasp of Hraban's general scholarly methodology. Herrad Spilling makes clear the impulse Hraban provided for heightened activity in the Fulda scriptorium. The other contributors show us different aspects of</page><page sequence="2">970 Reviews of Books Hraban's work as well as the limitations of his range. According to Wolfgang Haubrichs, Otfried of Weissenburg, author of an influential gospel har- mony, took his cue from Hraban in biblical exegesis but not in choosing to translate the gospels into the vernacular. Gaugolf Schrimpf demonstrates con- vincingly (though others have made the point be- fore) that Hraban, who merits a footnote in the history of Christian doctrine because of his role in the controversy over predestination, misinterpreted Gottschalk's rather enlightened and socially useful position. Raymund Kottje examines Hraban's inter- est in problems and sources of the law and finds it inspired by pastoral concerns; though not a mere compiler, Hraban was not a great canonist. Howev- er, his own legislative activity as archbishop of Mainz, during the last eight years of his life, dis- cussed here by Wilfried Hartmann, reveals common sense as well as a determined will to reform his church. These essays reflect their origin as papers pre- sented by working specialists to others of the same kind. They vary in degree of significance for an understanding of the Carolingian scholar but collec- tively provide us with a clear notion of where scholarship on Hraban stands now and what prob- lems of his work and influence remain to be ex- plored. BERNHARD W. SCHOLZ Seton Hall University PAULINE MOFFITT WATTS. Nicolaus Cusanus: A Fif- teenth-Century Vision of Man. (Studies in the History of Christian Thought, number 30.) Leiden: E. J. Brill. 1982. Pp. 248, f 78. Until relatively recently Nicholaus Cusanus has been the Melchizedek of the history of Christian thought-without parentage and with only a few contested paternities. Giordano Bruno seems to have inherited the same blood type, but fatherhood of Kant's noumenal and phenomenal world seems a long shot, with many more likely sires. With Pauline Moffitt Watts's Nicholaus Cusanus: A Fifteenth-Century Vision of Man we have an attempt to see Cusanus resolutely in the context of the spiritual and intellectual problems of late medieval and Ren- aissance culture. More specifically, Watts attempts to trace his conception of human nature and its capaci- ties to his assimilation and transformation of the four great traditions of his age: scholasticism, hu- manism, Platonism, and mysticism. It is a task that cried out to be done, and it is done here with exemplary success. As examples of con- nections between Cusanus and these traditions the following, in particular, should be noted. Cusanus's principle that "there is no proportion between the finite and the infinite" paralleled the nominalist dialectics of the potentia Dei absoluta and the potentia Dei ordinata. But Cusanus went beyond the scholas- tics in setting up more radical grounds for the absolute freedom and transcendence of God. The study sparkles in its delineation of this Ger- man Hercules's connections with Italian humanists: Toscanelli, Cesarini, Bracciolini, Traversari, Lorenzo Valla, and others. Cusanus's significant humanist associations paid rich dividends in bring- ing to his learning and library the new fifteenth- century translations of Plato and the Platonic tradi- tion. He appropriated the Platonic dialectic of unity and plurality while rejecting the existence of inter- mediaries or agents between God and the creation. Here Watts gives due attention to Cusanus's twelfth- century Platonic sources, in particular Thierry of Chartres. The transmutation of mysticism is exam- ined in conjunction with Cusanus's application of images of light and sight in two later writings, the De visione Dei and the De Beryllo. The study represents a careful analysis of each of Nicholaus Cusanus's major works, beginning with the De docta ignorantia (1440) and ending with the De apice theoriae, written a few months before his death in 1464. Cusanus's vision of man, the universe, and God has most commonly been seen in terms of a funda- mental breakthrough or reorientation, attested by the author himself, achieved in the De docta ignoran- tia. Through her Gesamtwerk approach, tracing the major themes and developments in five main chap- ter-studies, Watts is able to show not only the formidable disjunction of man from creator and natural world but also the transcending principle Cusanus evolved from the four great traditions he transmuted: he found the ultimate creative force in the human mind itself, created in the image and likeness of the divine mind. So Watts traces an affirmative anthropomorphic principle, anchored in an exploration of Genesis 1: 26, which counteracted the impersonal disjunctive metaphysic that dominat- ed Cusanus's earlier thinking. Man in his unique cosmic freedom created a world of conjectures, a world of objects, and a world of play that proved his creation in God's image and likeness. Here the author is even able to trace a convincing link to Pico's affirmation of freedom and dignity. No dulce loquentem this, but a happy conjunction with Charles Trinkaus's In Our Image and Likeness, with the humanity and divinity in Italian humanist thought. ERNEST B.
