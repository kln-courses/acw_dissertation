<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Religion and Health, Vol. 24, No. 3, Fall 1985 "Morals," Medicine, and the AIDS Epidemic PHILIP M.KAYAL ABSTRACT: It is the assumption of this article that when the etiology of an illness is framed in a "moral" language and the illness in question affects religiously stigmatized and legally proscribed minorities, the victims of the illness will be blamed for their ill health. Evidence is given of the connection between moralizing about a medical issue and the response of the medical establishment. The role of religion in the definition and interpretation of AIDS is emphasized as well as its effects on gay people and gay life. A political analysis of AIDS and its assumed causes is also given. These homophobic explanations are viewed as attempts to disenfranchise and discredit gay life further. Responsibility for containing AIDS is discussed in the context of "brokenness" between and among gay people. "Healing" is given as a necessary solution. As a sociologist specializing in ethnicity, minority relations, and religion, I have a distinct vantage point in examining the relation of religion and morals to medicine. My association with the Gay Men's Health Crisis Inc.,1 has also helped me stay abreast of changing sociopolitical interpretations of what AIDS is and how it is perceived and reacted to. I have also come to appreciate more fully how everyday "knowledge," religious ideas, and sociological in formation helped to delay the responses of both the organized medical com munity and social service professions to the causes and control of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome and to people with AIDS (PWA). It will be the argument of this article that medical and health care are related to the per ceived causality of illness and to the social status of those who are ill. As noted by internationally known parasitologist Kevin Cahill: When a fatal infection had struck down veterans attending an American Legion convention, health professionals across the country joined in the search for a solution. When women using tampons become ill with toxic shock syndrome, medical societies and research centers immediately focused their enormous talents on that problem. But when the victims were drug addicts, and poor Haitian refugees and homosexual men, their plight did not, somehow, seem as significant to those expected to speak for the health professions. No major research programs were announced, and until it became clear that the disease Philip M. Kayal, Ph.D., is Associate Professor of Sociology at Seton Hall University in South Orange, New Jersey.

According to Dr. Allan L. Goldstein, a leading Washington-based thymosin researcher, "the political component of AIDS is a tragedy." He continues, "There are individuals in the health political arena that couldn't care less about what happens to people in the gay community. 'They're getting what they deserve' is a typical response."3 The consequences of characterizing a medical problem in a moral language colored and distorted our understandings of AIDS and our perception of people with AIDS.4 As a result, interest in AIDS ranges from the purely scientific5 to the sensational.6 Sociological interest has not yet even attended to the way this particular epidemic has been constructed, interpreted, and presented to the public. This is not surprising, given sociology's historical understanding of gays and gay Ufe and the unique moraUstic and scientific frame of reference that traditional sociology embodies.7 Sociology typically operates within the prevailing social categories estabUshed by reUgious beUefs.8 Consequently, gay people are seen as deviants primarily because their behavior is "sinful."9 They are then per ceived as exceptional beings or outsiders with defamed characters.10 While sociology has often been sympathetic to the very groups it unin tentionally helps to isolate, Uke blacks and Jews, it has not done so with gays, who become more salient and differentiated every time "they" are studied.11 For the most part, minority people cannot be seen as individuals or distinct personalities. Rather, their essential nature is assumed to be tied up with a group or social aggregate that explains who and what "they" are. By definition, then, the behavior of "sinners" is sinful. So we have, for example, blacks and "homosexuals" as ontological states rather than social creations and perceptions. These "facticities," of course, are present in the social world we Uve in, but it might be philosophically unsound to build systems of analysis out of categories that are politicaUy derived and inconsistent with the nature of what it means to be both a human and a person. Yet, in terms of the AIDS crisis, we have the unique problem of defining an illness in terms of the social category "homosexual,"12 rather than seeing it as a problem that is primarily attacking single men who also happen to be same sexers.13 The illness itself is often referred to as the "gay plague."14 There is an attribution of causality to a whole category of people whether they are sick or not. This is not to deny the reaUty of the greater frequency of infection among homosexually active men. Rather, we are simply noting that the cause of illness is being shifted from a biological source to a social one. Gay becomes synonymous with evil, sickness, and sin. AU gays should be avoided; gay life is unhealthy.15 Apparently, the very situation of being gay can make a person sick. AIDS, however, is not caused by homosexual behavior per se. It merely</page><page sequence="3">220 Journal of Religion and Health seems to be transmitted through intimate sexual contact in which body fluids are exchanged.16 Attributing causality of illness to a social category also interferes with scientific objectivity and the investigative process.17 Concentrating on sexual behavior, which is thought to be the totality or summation of gay life, has prevented medical researchers from pursuing a broader search for causality and susceptibility. AIDS is not just a biological problem, but a sociological one as well. It is rooted in sociopolitical arrangements that have encouraged the development of unhealthy social and sexual behaviors. Pre-existing socioenvironmental conditions allowed the recently identified (LAV/HTLV-3) retrovirus to enter and basically become lodged within the gay community. The specific biological or viral cause of AIDS is one thing. The conditions and behaviors that allow it to spread and take hold are altogether different.18 In this sense, AIDS as an illness has many causes.19 That this pathogen began to appear in a subgroup of homosexually active American men and then spread more generally has affected our perceptions of gay male sexual behaviors. While same-sexing does take place within a limited social universe, the frequency and nature of sexual contact vary over time and by individual. Moreover, as more and more heterosexual women are being in fected, it is rather obvious that some gay men are bisexual and some women enjoy or prefer sex with them. There are numerous cases of AIDS appearing in non-drug-using heterosexuals as well.20 When blood products were found to carry the virus, and women were also named as transmitters, the whole society became potentially victimized. Even though AIDS is not necessarily a "minority illness," its perception as a predominately "gay illness" remains. Since people are defined in our society in terms of their sexual orientation and since homosexual behavior is seen as an identity and master status that is inclusive, sinful, and deviant, AIDS had to become a function of being gay or homosexually active.21 Gay men became "special people" who can and perhaps will be isolated and discounted. Since the health needs and social life of same sexers are defined moralistically, gay people are rarely understood as in dividuals or as contributing members of society. Problems encountered by same-sexers throughout the life cycle, then, are rarely analyzed in either human or sociopolitical terms, because as "homosexuals" they are voluntary outsiders or simply "queers." Hence, they are dispensable. In an interview with Charles Ortleb,22 Ann Guidici Fettner, co-author of The Truth About AIDS23 says: "Before I got involved with AIDS, I never realized the depth of prejudice against gays, Haitians and junkies.... The lack of conscience on the part of this government has bothered me worse than anything, but it's just a crystallization of the lack of concern for the health of the population outside the politically or financially advantaged." This helps explain why sociologists have not yet appreciated and acknowledged the particular role that religious or "moral" stigma has played in the development of gay psychology, culture, and political expression. While the AIDS epidemic brings this problem to the forefront, few, if any, scholars have looked at the relationship between religious beliefs, homophobia, political</page><page sequence="4">Philip M. Kay al 221 disenfranchisement, and ?lness. Indeed, if reUgion was ever the handmaiden of society, it is this case or epidemic that proves the premise out of which this ar ticle is presented?that is, stigma created by reUgious ideas (which have become reinforced by social science categories and vocabularies of analysis) are harmful to the well-being of marginal social groups poUtically, socially, and now medically. Sociology, homosexuality, and religion Gays must be seen as "deviants" by sociologists because same-sexers do not fit the assumptions of an already established and "sanctified" social system. It is normaUy taken for granted that this society is consensuaUy derived and, therefore, acceptable to everyone as it is. However, it is this assumption that makes problems for the homosexually active, since "same-sexing" is neither supported nor recognized as just, decent, or good by the dominant poUtical majority. Frequently, "gay social behavior" as well as the behavior of other minorities is not institutionalized or presented in ways acceptable to those in power. This, too, colors perceptions and insights and leads to greater dif ferentiation, which is seen as deviation rather than as a normal, albeit alter native, Ufe-style.24 Despite this, we are told that there is a "value-free sociology" that is apoUtical. To be consistent with its own thesis that the phenomenological order (including God) is created by "man," draws its energy and purpose from men and ends with them, sociology has to reflect and sup port implicit value judgments. It must necessarily analyze social life within the prevailing social constructions of reaUty, even though they are politically and not neutrally derived. This is most evident in the sociology of reUgion, which can only be a sociology of "man's relationship to the sacred."25 It cannot be an under standing of God or of the sacred or of a "faith experience" as such. In a sense, sociology creates the phenomenon it studies. Its insights then have poUtical and personal consequences which sociology claims are not its responsib?ity. Ironically, however, by examining reUgious behavior within the assumptions of the dominant society, sociology actually supports those social un derstandings of what it means to be reUgious. ReUgion frequently becomes for sociology what it is for the society in general, that is, that which is demon strated in organized, institutional settings.26 People who are "reUgious" in nontraditional ways are excluded as "deviants" and characterized as "sec tarians" rather than as members of Uving reUgious communities. Others who are "irreligious" are seen as subversives or outsiders.27 The emphasis in sociological research simply reconfirms the reasonableness of organized reUgious behavior and the systems to which this behavior is at tached. Sociology, then, participates in the creation of ideas and "knowledge" about the world. This in turn affects how people come to think, know, and ex perience the world. In general, religion becomes that which individuals or groups do relative to God. Consequently, God is enclosed with poUtical</page><page sequence="5">222 Journal of Religion and Health definitions and purposes, so that faith, the sacred, and organized religion are thought of as the same thing. All sociology can do is study religion as defined in quantifiable, behavioral terms, since "faith" as an evolving relationship with a living God cannot be measured, much less understood. So faith as an ex perience becomes "religion," measured or tested by sociologists who have to change the intrinsic nature of the "faith experience" in order to study it. As a result, people get caught up in an irrelevant and inaccurate account and un derstanding of the religious experience. The problem becomes compounded when sexual activity, romantic love, and the sacred are intertwined. Mainline churches, especially Roman Catholicism,28 have again come to emphasize only the reproductive end or pur pose of sexual activity.29This means that sexual activity on its own and for its own sake is demeaned. Obviously, this view discriminates against same-sexing and same-sexers. Moreover, it elevates marital reproductive sexual behavior into a societal norm legitimated by "love," which becomes the motivating force for sexual and personal relations. Logically, if men could love one an other, they should be allowed to have sex with one another. But since they can not reproduce, which is both a societal imperative and the motivation and rationale for sexual activity, they can neither have sex nor love one another. Since it is assumed that same-sexers cannot love one another (probably because they cannot be reproductive), they cannot have sex. Homosexual ac tivity, moreover, becomes an even greater sociopolitical issue when it is presented as an "alternative" or something equal to heterosexuality and/or heterosexism?that is, when it is no longer private and guilt-ridden, but organized, self-defined, public, and part of self-identity. When this happens, God becomes part of the arsenal to discredit same-sexing and dissolve gay pride and political activity. Sexually active people who are single and/or gay become outsiders and sinners precisely because they are nonreproductive. This political use of God, sex, and religion has greatly affected the social, religious, and political life of the homosexually active and has interfered with the development of an understanding of life, hope, death, dying, and healing among same-sexers, especially now during the fulmination about the AIDS epidemic. Because a "fundamentalist" and moral interpretation of this illness as sin is closer to a political assertion and strategy than a reasoned theological argument,30 it distorts the nature of God and religion and our relationship with and understanding of what we can simply call "the sacred." If God and society are permitted to become synonymous with one another, social norms become "cosmic" in origin and in nature. As a result, religion and the prevailing religious ideas about God become ways of dividing people into insiders and outsiders. Being religiously stigmatized allows all others to be insiders. The life of the excluded as well as their problems becomes theirs and theirs alone. This marriage of religion to political ideals has influenced both the analysis of gay life in general and the perception and meaning of AIDS. It has com plicated and even called into question the legitimacy of the search for its causes and cures. It has become increasingly difficult to understand AIDS outside of the religious and political climate of the past three years. The</page><page sequence="6">Philip M. Kay al 223 prevailing understanding of American society is that the nation is going through some new rebirth to the right. President Reagan is assumed to have a "moral" mandate to preserve traditional mores and institutions. These goals would offend only marginal people Uke women, blacks, and gays, whose poten tial poUtical threat needs to be neutralized. Since gays could be the most vocal opponents to Reaganomics and "ethics," their potential for opposition could be limited by a moral and now a medical stigma. In no other period of American history have fundamentaUst reUgious ideas been embraced by right wing poUtical figures in order to preserve a way of Ufe that may be collapsing because of its own moral inertia. Moralizing about social and health issues as they pertain to the needs of gay people (the ever-available scapegoats in times of social and institutional uncertainty) is a convenient and efficient way to bolster the integration and strength of the threatened in-group. Given the present economic crisis this nation is undergoing, it is not unreasonable to speculate about the potential benefits to be derived by crippUng the com petitive capacity of gay people. This is done easily by discrediting gays morally and reUgiously and by condemning their Ufe-styles and culture. One other way to do this, of course, is to assure gay people that AIDS is un der control, everything is in order, the pathogen is found, and a vaccine wiU soon be made available. This is simply not the case and is a very dangerous im pression to give.31 However, it would weaken the momentum in gay com munity-building efforts. In terms of this article, these "strategies" can only lead to a deeper "brokenness" in the self-identity and self-esteem of gay people. Sexual dysfunctions?that is, sexual activities that are not healthy and that confirm and vaUdate negative self-feeUngs?are Ukely to increase under these circumstances. According to Wedin,32 if left unrecognized and untreated, sexual needs wiU often be "expressed as a desire for anonymous sex, which in turn is directly responsible for the spread of AIDS." Such sexual behavior also reflects and augments social and poUtical apathy and shame in being homosexually active. Indeed, it is becoming increasingly evident that the fear of AIDS in the general population and even among gays themselves is not so much the fear of death from a dreaded disease (which it certainly is), but the fear of being stigmatized as a homosexual. AIDS forces people out of their "closets." There is a current "AIDS joke" that claims that the biggest problem a person with AIDS has is "convincing his mother that he is Haitian." AIDS as an illness, then, will have to be responsible for the poUticization of gay people, because the interconnection between identity, consciousness, and survival can no longer be avoided. The Ufe and future of a discredited minority are on the line, and the solution to the problem has to take place in the pubUc domain through poUtical action. Likewise, the way a person "reacts" to AIDS is an indication of what he or she thinks or feels about homosexual behavior, gay Ufe, and gay rights. Identifying with AIDS makes one aware of homophobia both sociaUy and personaUy and of how hateful or indifferent "straight" society can be and how self-hating and apolitical so many gays themselves are.33 Understandably, the present "moral" climate has created an apprehension</page><page sequence="7">224 Journal of Religion and Health about living and being in this world as a gay person. It has become almost im possible for a gay male to exist as such, to get sick, and, if he has to die, to do so in relative peace. Indeed, to die is one thing. To die of AIDS while thinking or believing that God has willed this as punishment for sin only complicates and distorts the whole process of both living and dying. It affects the ability and desire to be political in the world. Moreover, it is theologically unsound and unjustifiable.34 God, it would seem, is not in the business of pitting certain human beings or classes of people against one another. While it is an old sociological truth that those who control God control society, in this case it is the control of God by those who control society which is significant. It has always been the fate of outsiders and minorities to have either the wrong gods or less effective gods to protect them. Gay people are among the few denied any God at all. The "insider-God" then becomes a vengeful and spiteful God who punishes. This vicious and self-righteous God is a social invention in consistent with the "God of love" found in the New Testament. This punishing God is an anthropomorphic creation setting the stage for the fur ther disenfranchisement of gay people. Obviously, we are not talking about personal beliefs and notions of God. In stead, we are talking about the sociopolitical consequences and functions of being "in or out" with God. After all, a standard unifying element in any society is "shared beliefs about what God or the ultimate is all about." Non believers or nonmembers are sinners, barbarians, and subject to special status and treatment. If you are unequal before God, you can be assured of social inequality. The major disenfranchised groups in America today are precisely those that lack religious justification and recognition. God, for example, is not available to women in their struggle for equality. The nature of American politics and society demands that social causes or movements be legitimated, especially by religion. There is no better explanation for the failure of the gay rights movement than the absence of public support by mainstream religious establishments. The consequences of this are manifold but most significantly affect political consciousness and behavior. To be seen with or to know or love gays is to be a deviant, or the modern-day equivalent of the "nigger lover." To be seen being with or helping a sick gay male is to break the taboo against seeing gays as human and individualized. Identifying with gay struggles is the ultimate test of homophobia. While many women have assisted in the struggle for gay social and health rights, the vast majority of support comes from within the gay male community. Resolving gay people's medical and health problems, however, cannot be done without changes in the overall social system. Nor can it be done without support from outside the gay community. This requires, at the very least, the dissemination of information on gay life and people with AIDS, in particular. This is being done mostly by gays with little support from government agencies, because AIDS is still not perceived as a national or international health issue except by the medical profession. What ultimately has to be altered, however, is institutional homophobia and heterosexism. This is why AIDS is the particular "problem" it is. It threatens and challenges all</page><page sequence="8">Philip M. Kayal 225 American institutions to acknowledge that gay people are, in fact, everywhere, fit no stereotype, and are part of the everyday world. People with AIDS come from aU walks of Ufe, occupations, and professions, and frequently become known as gay only after becoming ill. Like most people, gays and PWAs are connected to many others who are concerned about the health and welfare of their friends, yet remain detached because of homophobia. Morals, medicine, and gays AIDS has become the perfect poUtical-medical issue of the 1980s precisely because of the way homosexual behavior has been traditionaUy perceived and morally analyzed. It is the classic case of "blaming the victims." Blaming AIDS on gays is saying that sexual orientation is a uniform and a significant social category. It implies that since homosexual behavior is a freely chosen way of Ufe that is clearly immoral and antisocial, illness is the natural out come. One "illness" simply perpetuates another. However, are not there reaUy homosexuaUties35 and heterosexuaUties? Are people intrinsically nothing more than whom they sleep with? Is not this question possible only in a society with strict sex-role segregation? Are not "homosexual" and "heterosexual" social categories necessary in the logic and setting of a sexist society? Are not there different and personal meanings attached to sexual behavior that frequently become identities because of their social meanings and the sociopoUtical reac tion to them? Yet, if we do not speak and identify behavior and illness by the sexual behavior or orientation of the poUtical majority, why should we do so for the same-sexer or social minority? In short, there can be no "homosexual illness" as such, because there are no heterosexual illnesses.36 To believe the opposite is to fuse two categories that do not necessarily exist together. There is nothing implicit, for example, about being "a Haitian" that causes illness or AIDS. The same is true for and of homosexuality and heterosexuality. AIDS, in reality, is a medical problem frequently affecting individuals who have varying degrees of intimate social-sexual contact with people of the same sex. AIDS has created a crisis in pubUc health and social intercourse. It is not a "gay man's health crisis" per se, but a pubUc health issue affecting everyone and gay men in particular. It has consequences on every social institution since same-sexers are part of every institution in our society. That the problem and situation have not been seen this way is a function of the reUgious stigma placed on gay Ufe and people and the general lack of compassion for PWAs engendered by this. People are dying. Most are gay. To say gay people are dying is to make a true political observation; and it is this fact, which cannot be ignored, that turns this general health issue into a gay man's health problem. Ironically, it is this same fact that tempers the response of others, including the medical profession, to this health crisis. Ob viously, I am suggesting that making a medical issue into a moral issue has far-reaching impUcations in the way the problem is perceived, investigated, resolved, managed, and controUed. It sets up the frame of reference within</page><page sequence="9">226 Journal of Religion and Health which the search for both causality and cure takes place. It likewise affects people's identities, self-worth, community participation, and understanding of "healing." If one were to do a political analysis of AIDS, it would seem that the definition of the illness as something intrinsic to being a "homosexual" is clearly designed to undermine and discredit the whole phenomenon of homosexuality and to immobilize gay community life and culture. Because all "gay" life and culture is assumed to be reduced to homosexual interactions, that is, impersonal sex between men, it is no wonder that gays are seen as uniformally sexual in style and behavior. AIDS, then, became a function of what same-sexers did with one another, which, of course, was nothing more than sex, since it is believed that it is only sex that attracts gays to one another. Same-sexers were never thought to be drawn to one another by love, intellect, feelings, or similarities in expectations. In truth, however, not only are there different and many homosexualities, there are a lot of things that gay people do with one another that are not sexual in intent or purpose. Moreover, many things that characterize gay life or that affect gays are a function of being single rather than being same-sexers. For example, and by analogy, if there was an outbreak of Legionnaire's Disease at a convention of Dignity, an organization of gay and lesbian Catholics, would anyone have bothered to look in the air ducts for the cause? Maybe, but after everyone's sperm, anuses, and vaginas were examined. We are not speaking here of the likely mode of transmission but rather of causality. Obviously, men do have sex with one another and may do so for different reasons than opposite-sexers or lesbians. Many same-sexers, in reaction to the prevailing social definition and expectation, may even reduce the whole of life and even identity to being a sexual object. Could this not be seen as a form of false consciousness in which same-sexers internalize the outsiders' im pressions of them and think about themselves in the same terms? While most gays would not reduce all that gay means to constant genital contact, even if this were the case, there is no reason why single, healthy people cannot ex perience the pleasures of the flesh as frequently and diversely as they please without having guilt, shame, or illness attached. Gay people who get AIDS are also single people who get AIDS, and the lack of response to their medical needs is another reflection of American sexophobia,37 Likewise, it is within the contemporary understanding of morals and sexuality fostered by the social sciences that the medical establishment set its original agendas. Because of the prevailing notions about AIDS and homosexuality, every early explanation for the causes of AIDS was designed to undermine the legitimacy of being a same-sexer. The moralists almost succeeded in making it a punishment for sin. This lasted until a New York Times article by Dr. Kevin Cahill,38 a Jesuit-trained Irish Catholic physician, clearly indicated the dangers of mixing morals and medicine. So successful was his argument that he persuaded Terrence Cardinal Cooke of New York to read the invocation at an AIDS symposium held at Lenox Hill Hospital in the spring of 1983 in New York. This one public statement by only one leading American churchman did</page><page sequence="10">Philip M. Kay al 227 more to neutralize the issue and bring it into the medical domain than any other strategy. Unfortunately, mora?st doctors and scientists were slow to understand that gay Ufe, homosexuality, and AIDS were not necessarily interchangeable and similar phenomena. At first, AIDS was thought to be a function of what gays do as individuals or as group members to one another. Either way, gay people lost. If gays ceased to reach out to one another either sexuaUy or otherwise, the whole phenomenon of homosexuality would disappear. If homosexuals would disappear, AIDS would disappear. If AIDS does not disappear, homosexuals would most certainly disappear. Since our society has created insiders and outsiders, normals and deviants, cultures and countercultures, unassumed identities and self-conscious iden tities with political overtones, changing sexual behavior would change iden tity and the basis, nature, and content of community. Gays would cease to be a coUectivity, and that is exactly what would be acceptable to the political majority. The generalized and pubUc gay culture would disappear only to be replaced by private, nonsexual, and individualized "friendships." This has been the goal of religious institutions and the practical effect of legal proscrip tions. Now fear of illness is being used to frighten gays away from associating and identifying with one another. There is no escaping the argument that the way homosexuality is defined and constructed has affected the public's perceptions of PWAs, the response of the general public, and the Ufe and future of gay people themselves. Sexual activity is not the sum total of gayness. It is one of the activities that go on within and among people who are attracted to one another?for whatever reason or purpose. The "gay community" is the context within which certain "gay sensibiUties" are developed and nurtured. To take one dimension of social intercourse and make it the standard and thrust for the existence of a whole group of people is nothing less nor more than a necessary sociopoUtical imperative. It is legitimated by organized reUgion and then "substantiated" if not reified by social science theory and research. This happens to minorities aU the time: they become defined in terms of one attribute, which becomes a master status outweighing all others. This is not to suggest that gay people disavow their "homosexuaUty." Rather, it is to note that the significance of sexual activity for many gays is more Ukely a learned behavior created in response to the definition of gays as only homosexuals. The truth is that one can be gay and not necessarily be sexual. ActuaUy, that men may learn to "love one another" and to treat one another with respect and equality is a far greater threat to our social system than whether or not they have sex with one another. If these relationships or "affections" become sexual, however, they again would challenge the heterosexual estabUshment by changing the pur pose of sex and the context within which it is permitted. In other words, heterosexual society and culture (which are in the pubUc domain and synonymous with the "world taken-for-granted") are permitted to draw their raison d'?tre from the sexual energies and attractions of the heterosexually identified toward one another precisely because heterosexual</page><page sequence="11">228 Journal of Religion and Health activity can lead to reproduction. Indeed, it is often argued that if other op tions were available to the heterosexually committed, they may not choose to be reproductive and society would then suffer. Interpret this to mean that sex equals reproduction, which implies bonding and families as well. Same-sexers, however, also seek one another out. Their object is pleasure or love, which cer tainly is as valid a need for bonding as is reproduction. As male role players, however, permanent, equitable, and compatible relations are difficult. It is hard to change "scripted" male behavior. Multiple partering might be a result of conditioning and male psychology more than homosexuality as such. Again we have a structural condition producing a "life-style" and behavioral mode. The need to "re-socialize" men into new identities and behaviors cannot be stressed enough. Let us assume for a moment that gay men who are sexually active at the present time are engaging in a form of "collective suicide." They might be doing so because they do not know how to be gay without being sexual. If they have internalized the prevailing meaning of what it means to be gay, that is, to be homosexual, changing their sexual behavior would be very difficult. If they cease to be sexual, they will cease to be gay. Yet gays relate to one another in a multitude of ways that indicate there is an ethnocultural and political basis for being gay?not just a sexual one. While individuals have the right to live primarily as sexual beings, it would seem unwise to do so at the present time. Moreover, it shows a lack of respect and concern for the welfare of the community members who become exposed to even more "pathogen carriers" than would be necessary if people were either celibate or monogamous. In short, it is simply "maladaptive" to be sexually active in ways that have been determined to be unsafe.39 Gay life, sex, and AIDS As a result of the social control of sexuality and the meanings attached to dif ferent sexual behaviors, gays are being systematically destroyed and alienated from their emotions and needs. What is really killing sexually active, single men and women is the inability of a sexophobic society to allow them healthy, responsible sex and relationships that are more inclusive. They are not sup posed to be having any sex unless they are "bonded" (legally married); so the early explanations of AIDS started to attack the very life-style characteristics of adult single gay men, namely multiple partnering. One of the first explanations for AIDS was "sperm overload." What is it? What does it mean? Are homosexually active people digesting more sperm now than before? Is there a built-in biological limit to the number of sexual partners one can have? It means that theoretically the body cannot handle too many different sperms. How could this position be justified to the Romans, Greeks, and Latins and to the generations of women forced to earn a living by servicing men? Moreover, the assumption here is that sex should be a limited or "budgeted" activity rather than a free and readily acceptable gift. Then there was "promiscuity itself"?a difficult concept to define, a meaningless concept because of its moralistic overtones. What does it mean to</page><page sequence="12">Philip M. Kay al 229 sexually active and youthful men who are either straight or single and/or gay? What are American males supposed to do on Friday and Saturday nights? What does the dominant or popular culture teU everyone to do on those same nights? If you do not have to worry about pregnancy, or even a relationship and all the trimmings (love, marriage, family, responsib?ity) that go with heterosexual coitus, then of course many gay men have had "a lot of sex" with many different partners. But they never got deathly iU from it before. Multiple partnering does not cause illness per se. It merely increases the UkeUhood of exposure to someone who is sick or infected. Then it became analingus and manual anal penetration ("fisting"). The for mer is not terribly different from cunnilingus and normally should cause no problem between healthy individuals. Fisting, on the other hand, raises dif ferent questions both aesthetically and biologically. It appeals to only a smaU minority of sexuaUy active gay men who can physicaUy manage this form of acrobatic sexual encounter. If some gay men bought the secular notion that sex is aU that matters in Ufe and that the perfect orgasm means everything, people would be Ukely to experiment. Fisting, together with "water sports," should be put into this category. Now what else do these media-created "hedonistic" gays do besides have "esoteric sex"? They use drugs, especially "poppers." But so do countless others. Legal or Ulegal drugs are the norm in our drug-oriented society. Pop pers rarely harmed anyone.40 They heightened sexual pleasure and altered per ceptions of music and dance. Marijuana further enhanced pleasure regardless of the activity being experienced. Since all this made gays sick, it was now too many antibiotics that depressed the immune system. If so, why do doctors continue to supply them so randomly to the whole population?41 The problem with this explanation is that cancer patients take more im muno-suppressive drugs (chemotherapy) and antibiotics than any amount of tetracycline could match. The reason gays needed so many antibiotics, of course, was because they were contracting STDs (SexuaUy Transmitted Dis eases) at very high rates. The truth is, however, that a normal, sexually active male wiU probably contract syph?is, gonorrhea, and/or crabs, at least once or twice. To this Ust must be added herpes for straights and gays, and amoebiasis for gays. Once cured, however, you are cured, and your immune response retur ns to normal. As if aU this "?logic" were not enough, there are those who do not want gays gathering in groups or playing together. They do not want to work or live with gays. This would produce the ultimate in segregation and create a mood of self-aUenation and social annihilation among gays themselves. Indeed, this brings us to two other critical issues. There is reason to beUeve that there may in fact be both a sociological and psychobiological predisposition to acquire AIDS or, for that matter, any illness.42 The first issue refers to a segregated social world created by heterosexist societal institutions within which unhealthy social and sexual behaviors flourish. This affects the second issue, in that a homophobic moral climate has forced many gays to interna?ze a self hate that makes them more vulnerable to infection.</page><page sequence="13">230 Journal of Religion and Health While there are no psychological or political profiles of people with AIDS or people who are engaging in unhealthy sexual practices, it is quite possible that AIDS becomes a way out for already self-destructive personalities who either cannot or will not alter their behavior. On the other hand, only a very small number of people have contracted AIDS, and it is quite possible that sexually active people are not necessarily compulsive,43 but rather see themselves not at risk. Indeed, even the steady partners of many AIDS patients have not con tracted AIDS in the ratio that one would expect if merely a single exposure to only one pathogen were enough to cause infection. Acquiring an immune deficiency most probably is a phenomenon with many causes requiring the presence of many variables.44 These variables might be sociological in that they have something to do with the intersection of genetic makeup, personal health history, legal and illegal drug use with life-style, degree of social con nectedness, values, and the availability of social and sexual options.46 Despite the seriousness of the illness, however, there are people who insist on the right to play "Russian roulette" with their health and who are still well even though they have not curtailed their sexual activities. This would be maladaptive behavior precisely because so little is known about the genesis and operational mode of the AIDS pathogen and the conditions that allow it to become ef fective. This is partially the result of concentrating on AIDS causality within a homosexual context. What is needed is a centred theory of AIDS causality that covers its presence in all afflicted populations. This includes Haitians and Africans (Zaire), intravenous drug users, hemophiliacs, same-sexers, and children and spouses of PWAs.46 Given the newness of the LAV/HTLV-3 discovery, it would be wise simply to abstain, since becoming infected is so random. In other words, it is a random chance that a person may or may not be exposed to someone with AIDS (or carrying the AIDS virus) who does not even know it. The medical establishment has not publicly warned gays of the risks involved in having sex at this time. Apparently the doctors see sex as a personal right and responsibility?which it normally is and should be. In an epidemic, however, should not a more public education be undertaken? To date it has only been through the efforts of the Gay Men's Health Crisis, Inc., that gays have been warned of the dangers of multiple partnering. Little has been done, however, to re-socialize sexually maladaptive gay men to more holistic encounters with one another. Instead, dramatic public policy decisions have been made that only confuse the issue further. For example, sex in gay bath houses in San Francisco is now forbidden.47 This only shifts the location of sexual activity elsewhere and hardly cuts down on unsafe or maladaptive sexual behavior as such. What the medical establishment has done, however, is create a state of utter paranoia in the gay community by suggesting that the incubation period of this illness is somewhere between two months and four years or even more.48 The political consequences of this "idea" might be the desexualization of gay life and the practical end of homosexual relations. It is not the well-being of gays that is intended here, because celibacy has not been suggested. Rather, the suggested time span is more fodder to intimidate same-sexers</page><page sequence="14">Philip M. Kay al 231 psychologically and socially. We are talking here about creating retroactive paranoia, not the benefits of encouraging responsible sexual behavior during an epidemic. When is it AIDS? This brings us to the next point. It is not even certain how to define what AIDS is or when an illness should be defined as such. The Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, insists that a case be defined as AIDS only after an opportunistic disease such as Kaposi Sarcoma, for example, is evident. Yet "it has become relatively clear that AIDS represents a wide spectrum of disease processes rather than simply CDC-defined cases."49 Moreover, there is another class of people who may at present be symptom-free, since the in cubation period is unknown, who are at present sexually active. They may be transmitting the pathogen to countless others unknowingly. Another serious problem is the "numbers" game Math AIDS. At any given moment, the Center for Disease Control (CDC) claims the numbers are down. Translated, this means that it is not a real or growing menace, so no real urgen cy exists. When the numbers go up, it again becomes a "gay illness," which simply isolates it from general pubUc support. As of April 15, 1985, the CDC reported 9,608 cases of AIDS nationwide. This does suggest that the rate of in crease has slowed down. In reaUty, the statistical reporting process has been decentraUzed. Reporting is now done first on the local and state levels, so that it may take several more months before data are passed on to the CDC. Any statistics reported for the most recent calendar quarter are, therefore, unreUable. Moreover, if the rate of increase does not slow appreciably, the 20,000th case will be diagnosed by the beginning of spring 1986, bringing the real number of people with prodromal AIDS up to about 200,000! The early prediction of a growth rate that doubles every six months is also misleading because it deals only with rates of increase rather than accurate "raw numbers." The projec tion is derived only from the confirmed cases documented in 1981 when the phenomenon of erratic and unexpected gay illness and deaths was finaUy called AIDS. Before that, starting in the late 1970s, there had been hints that something was amiss in the gay community. There were extraordinarily high amounts of STDs, amoebiasis, mysterious "fatigues," and general enteric disorders in previously healthy gay men. There were lymphomas and other "opportunistic infections" that simply were not recognized as part of an emerging pattern or syndrome. There may have been many more AIDS deaths than anyone reaUzed long before 1981. The medical estabUshment as such, however, was not interested in diagnosing, treating* or preventing illness in the gay community, especiaUy if it was thought to be sexually transmitted in offensive ways as amoebiasis is.50 This now endemic parasitic infection is transmitted among same-sexers by analingus and exposure to minute amounts of fecal matter. Homosexual sex</page><page sequence="15">232 Journal of Religion and Health became "dirty sex," which simply made the community more isolated and suspect. Defending gays and gay health issues and needs thus became increasingly difficult with the end of the Carter administration. The current President's em phasis on family life and moralism has left the status of gay people more questionable than at any other time. It can be argued that AIDS is an ac ceptable form of genocide against unwanted minorities! The numbers can sup port this argument. The Reagan administration may be counting on homophobia to prevent the politicization of this health issue by gay people. To fight back, gays have to come out of the closet. AIDS can either scare gays back into submission or become the rallying point for community organization. The government must certainly recognize the gay potential to organize the gay community and all people who are not served adequately by the health delivery system of this country, that is, if homophobia can be over come. Since illness can be understood by everyone, it could become the rallying point for the development of a truly useful and comprehensive national health care program, something the Reagan administration opposes. The logic here is very simple. "Homosexuals are merely sexually active people interested in hedonistic consumption and pleasure. They are ashamed of who they are and what they do and will never publicly defend themselves even when confronted with death. Since they are only sexually attracted to one another, if they stop having sex with one another, they will cease to exist as a people or community. The same is true if they die. The easiest way of neutralizing the political potential of gays is to destroy the basis of their existence, their sexuality." The "probable" cause of AIDS On April 23, 1984, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Margaret Heckler, announced that "the probable cause of AIDS has been found."51 Rather than the result of the "triumph of science" over a dreaded illness, it is becoming apparent that over a year ago French researchers at the Pasteur In stitute isolated a similar virus called Lymphadenopathy-Associated Virus or LAV. In this country competition between CDC and the National Institutes of Health and between these agencies and their French counterpart prevented scientists from sharing their findings.52 What is more important for the pur poses of this article, however, is the meaning and consequences of this discovery for the lives of PWAs and gay people in general. For example, if the previously-suggested "medicalization of homophobia" is a real possibility, it would not be unreasonable to suggest that blood infections will be used as a basis for both social and political identification and discrimination. What the Heckler announcement has done is basically assure the nation that the blood supply would now be safe. There was now no need for the general or mainstream population to be concerned or fearful any longer. It has been con sistently noted53 that both gay people and PWAs have been defined as</page><page sequence="16">Phi?p M. Kayal 233 subgroups of Americans. This may or may not be true and is a function of how minority is defined and what criteria are used. As it pertains to gay people, for example, if class, education, income, and occupation are used as indices, then the vast majority of PWAs are basically in the mainstream. In other words, gay people in general are not different from "insiders" except for their sexual behavior if and when it is pubUcly acknowledged. What Heckler evidently meant was that "good, clean-Uving, family identified people" who are in need of blood can now rest in peace.54 But those who are stiU unmarried and sexual (promiscuous, by definition) stiU wiU be at risk, but that is no reason to care. The government can assume that its respon sibiUty is over. Science has solved a medical problem in a relatively short period of time. The medical and scientific estabUshment is operating ef ficiently and can respond effectively to future health emergencies. AIDS now might just become another "managed illness" Uke multiple sclerosis and no longer will remain a national priority. Likewise, gay people frequently have confused the discovery of the pathogen with scientific fact and assume a cure is in the immediate future. Actually, very Uttle is known about the retro-virus Human T-Lymphotropic Virus or HTLV-3, its mode of operation, its genesis, its viability, its selection of targets, and why it is so destructive. Testing for its presence wiU not shed any more Ught on its overall meaning to the body's immune function and future health. Whether the person now carrying the pathogen is immune, highly con tagious, stiU processing LAV/HTLV-3, or beginning to succumb wiU not be known from an antibody test for its presence.55 Consequently, resuming sexual activity now is probably maladaptive and counterproductive. That more and more people are doing so needs explanation and probably has something to do with perceived sense of risk as well as some cluster of psychosocial variables. The point is, however, that unless AIDS spreads further into the pubUc domain, concern and interest in AIDS wiU probably wane now that the "probable" causative agent has been identified.56 Given the known patterns of transmissibility, it can again become only a "gay problem," since gays have the capacity (and now the responsibility) to stop the spread of the epidemic by refusing to engage in unsafe sexual practices with highly suspect partners. "Whose responsibiUty is personal health" might become the new medical-poUtical response to the AIDS epidemic. Whether a cure is immediately found or not, gay people both individuaUy and coUectively do, in fact, have the obligation to have responsible social and sexual relations with one another. This is more easily done when a sense of communal responsibiUty is present. Ironically, AIDS has become a good in dicator of community consciousness and solidarity. On one hand, there are highly articulated, motivated, and concerned individuals and groups who are struggling for justice and recognition from the society in general. On the other hand, there is also evidence of a great deal of "brokenness" among and be tween gay men, which is manifested in self-destructive sociosexual behavior.57 Unhealthy sexual behavior during an epidemic must be indicative of something other than the importance of sex in human Ufe. It is a reflection of</page><page sequence="17">234 Journal of Religion and Health the traditional meaning of gay as "sex," the latent effects of religious ex clusion and minority status, the sexualization of American culture, and the presence of homophobia among gays. For survival's sake, this self-destruction and self-hate demand healing. Healing "Healing" as such is normally understood as a religious phenomenon. Because of its democratic nature, however, it is often overlooked and underplayed by established religious organizations.58 Nor is it made accessible to or sought af ter by people generally stigmatized by religious institutions. Given the specific constituencies that organized religion serves, this is not unreasonable. Single people, gay or lesbian people are not the mainstay of the religious establishment. As already suggested, liturgically and doctrinally, both chur ches and sects are hostile to the interests of single and sexual people. Healing, for many gays, then, is seen as just another religious activity or plot and rejec ted as such. Healing, however, is broader than just religious behavior as such. It is a way of perceiving and relating to self, others, and the "god factor." Glock tells us that the ways people relate to one another and themselves and God (however conceived) are intimately connected and determinative.59 The "healing" referred to in this article has more to do with the creation and rein forcement of a positive self-image and commitment to community than any dogmatic acceptance of an alienating and unaccepting God, which has been the "God-experience" of many gay men and lesbians. Presenting the "God-experience" as organized religion is only a sociological construction and perception and not necessary in and to faith and theology. Because so many gay people have been denied or have denied themselves ac cess to any potentially life-giving energy that comes from belief or faith in God or simple religious identification and behavior, a unique type of psychosocial victimization has occurred. Especially now, with the prevalence of AIDS and the suspicion that gay people are living inauthentic lives or even worse, dying in and because of "sin," gay people have been forced to evaluate and frequent ly alter their values and life-styles.60 AIDS has disrupted the very tempo of the social and personal lives of gay people just when self-affirmation as a gay per son was becoming easier and more possible.61 As a whole way of life becomes accused, gay people are again living in fear and doubt. Witness the increase in counseling groups, consciousness raising groups, and support networks that are dealing with gay self-esteem. They are all in response to the growing per ception of "brokenness" in and among gay people. There are relatively high levels of alcohol and drug abuse, depression, and suicide among gays and lesbians.62 There are people whose Uves have become immobile because of their fear of AIDS, and there are thousands of others who are addicted to sex and who cannot or will not change their behavior because they do not know how else to exist in the world as a gay person. Healing is a process through which a person can celebrate and accept</page><page sequence="18">Philip M. Kayal 235 sexuality as part of Ufe. Healing leads to self-affirmation and more holistic relations. This leads to pride and responsible social and sexual behavior in the context of a Ufe-giving culture and community. What is being hinted at here is the need to redefine what "gay" means and what Ufe-giving sexual practices are. If gay means loving men with aU the joy, freedom, expressiveness, and obUgation that this implies, then Ufe and Uving wiU and can continue. If it means only the sexuaUzation of others, then survival (physically, emotionaUy, and psychologically) becomes a dubious proposition. AIDS has affected the very fabric of gay relationships and the reason gays exist as a distinguishable population. AIDS has altered the natural flow of love and feelings that human beings can have for one another.63 Seeing AIDS as sin and punishment only compUcates the picture. It forces people to be ashamed and guilty. Being separated from God makes gays outsiders and deprives the community of legitimacy. It also makes gays poUticaUy im potent. As previously indicated, AIDS and the conditions that engender it con only be solved in the pubUc domain through concerted political action, and this means that AIDS must be embraced as an issue by everyone?especially by gay people. To do otherwise is to live with shame and to die without dignity, for people are being diagnosed with AIDS at the rate of three a day in New York City alone. Unless self-pride is present, gay people might run away from accepting, loving, and helping those with AIDS. With this in mind, "heaUng" can be seen as the challenge of restoration to oneself and of gay people to one another. For people with AIDS, the experience of healing should be seen as one that is Ufe-giving and supportive. After all, healing is the restoration of hope through reconciUation and includes the gifts of inner peace, self-acceptance, and optimism. This is especiaUy necessary since AIDS is frequently a death sentence which necessitates questioning the purpose and meaning of Ufe. Since God has been brought into the AIDS question, it would seem logical that a "reconciliation" with God, however he or she is conceived, would also be appropriate if not necessary. Fortunately, contemporary Christian theologians teU us that "the God who is" is essentially a "God of love." This is not a judgmental and capricious God who punishes and destroys life out of a sense of self-righteousness and anger. Rather, it is a God who encourages and demands a reconciliation to the "fact of unconditional love." This is what is meant by restoration and a "deeper healing of self." It is both a psychologicaly and philosophical truism that people must be self-accepting in order to be healthy. This is not easy if one is "out with God." It is in the acceptance of self, then, that one learns how to live and then how to die. A self-awareness that is enriching and "Ufe-giving" comes out of the experience of acceptance. It is simply human to be present to everyone, especially the sick, so that we all can be connected and integrated. It used to be caUed "giving witness to the truth." In fact, it is giving witness to the process of dying.64 Every time we overcome the world and confront our own mortaUty, we come to a recognition of resurrection. It is basicaUy the thesis of this article that people reconciled to themselves live every moment in the expectation of "deliverance" and resurrection, and it is this dynamic and</page><page sequence="19">236 Journal of Religion and Health dramatic promise of "renewal" that is being denied those suffering or living with AIDS. Quite unexpectedly, the suddenness and virulence of the AIDS epidemic has fostered a new maturity among gay people.65 It has helped the gay community to lay claim to its own symbols and rituals. Rather than being defined only in sexual terms or as a "sexual category," gays have created a growing in stitutional network. There are religious organizations, political clubs, health facilities, recreational groups, professional and academic associations, caucuses, lobbying groups, and entertainments, all contributing to a fuller un derstanding of gay life. AIDS has actually brought the best out of the gay community. It has added an incipient ethnogenesis for gays by providing a common focus and political issue touching on the very question of survival. It has brought gay people together in new and different ways. There is now a more inclusive and holistic way of relating and being in the world as a gay person. There is also a growing sense of a "shared history" developing that deserves to be known and examined as such. Finally, I believe that AIDS has brought to consciousness the realization that the symbols of this society, God included, are not owned by the "moral insiders" but belong in justice to everyone.

Many gay organizations, including the Gay Men's Health Crisis, Inc., have published what are commonly known as "safe sex guidelines." Basically, they encourage reduction of anonymous sexual contacts with many different partners. They also suggest that non mucosal sex become normative and that condoms be used to prevent the exchange of body fluids especially during anal intercourse. 40. The use of poppers (nitrates) during sex and while partying has been common among gays for several years. They have been suspected of causing some immune suppression but not permanently. Recently, a report appearing in The New England Journal of Medicine (May 24, 1984) suggests that certain kinds of inhaled agents like poppers do in fact reduce the number of helper (t-4) T cells required to fight infection. Their use by gays and others seems to have declined appreciably in the last few months. See also d'Eramo, J., "Poppers and AIDS: Let's Get Real," The New York Native, 1984,95, 16-17. 41. Antibiotics are generally recognized as immune suppressors. Whether or not they have a long-term negative effect on the body's own immune response system has yet to be clearly demonstrated.

There is a time lapse between date of infection, appearance of illness, and diagnosis. It is not yet known at what stage of development the pathogen is virulent and transmissible. It is possible that the overall physical health of the host over time is also a variable in either con taining or encouraging its growth. Most cases, however, do fall within a two-year period of exposure, awareness of illness, and diagnosis. 49. D'Eramo, J., "Is it AIDS yet?," The New York Native, 1984,91, 17. 50. Nimmons, op. cit. 51.
