<plain_text><page sequence="1">VI.-NEW BOOKS. The Problem of Evil in Plotinus. By B. A. E. FULLER. Cambridge: University Press, 1912. Pp. xx, 336. THE growing interest in the serious, study of the great Greek meta- physicians as philosophers who "count" even for our own times is strikingly evinced by the number of recent works dealing with the thought of Plotinus. Among these recent works, Mr. Fuller's book deserves a respectable place. I do not share his confidence in the ease with which he has proved the moral and religious speculations of so great a man to be incoherent, but I am glad that any fresh work should bring Plotinus and his philosophy before the attention of our " studious youth " even if by way of " refutation ". And I readily recognise that with whatever defects in exact scholarship and historical insight Mr. Fuller's statement of Plotinus' position on the ultimate issues is, in the main, clear and fair, and that thanks are especially due to him and the friends whose assistance he acknowledges for the very useful selection of texts from the Enneads printed at length in the notes to his book. There is a cortain doubleness of aim about his argument which makes criticism difficult. It is manifest that his purpose throughout is not merely to state and examine the teaching of the founder of Neo-Platonism on its own merits, but also to use his opportunity for the purposes of a general assault on modern Monistic theories which assert the perfection of the actual Universe. The consequence of this is that a great deal of his space is taken up with an argument which can hardly be said to be relevant as against the special view of Plotinus or of Platonism generally. The argument, which assumes several different forms, but is in principle the same at bottom, is that to teach the " perfection of the Universe " or the doctrine that evil is unreal leads directly to the denial of the worth of the ethical life. The only sense in which the world is perfect is a purely naturalistic one. Everything is perfect as it is, from the point of view of the whole, as just that expression of the nature of things which it is, and no one thing is, in this sense, more perfect than any other. Christ, for 'example, is no more perfect in this Spinozistic sense than Judas, since each contributes his special performance to the life of the one whole. But perfection, so understood, is not moral perfection. Hence the believer in moral perfection is bound, so Mr. Fuller seems to hold, to be metaphysically a dualist. Formally, to be sure, this reasoning is not applicable to Plotinus, who, like his master Plato, holds firmly to the view that evil is ineradic7able from the actual world. But, it seems to be meant, Plotinus, though he formally asserts only the " goodness,A' not the " perfection " of the actual, involves himself in a dilemma, partly by his agreement with Plato that evil is strictly " not-beings" partly by the fact that in arguing for the thesis " the world is good," he borrows Stoic arguments whicfi had been employed by the Stoics to prove the perfection -in the naturalistic sense-of the world. Now I am not at all clear that, on either of these grounds, Plotinus is really open to the charge of-by implication-relapsing into a merely naturalistic monism. This would be</page><page sequence="2">404 NEW BOOKS. a fair charge if, for example, the Stoic thought that "partial evil" is "universal good " were the whole or the principal part of his Theodicy. But that view, according to which evil is merely apparent, is, of course, not permissible to a Platonist. Hence it is only as a partial solution of the problem of evil, demonstrably valid for some cases, but quite inade- quate in others, that Plotinus admits the justification of seeming evil by a reference to the point of view of the " whole " into his Theodicy. I think Mr. Fuller would have done his author more justice on this head if he had been more alive to the dialectical character of Plotinus's method. Like Aristotle, Plotinus does not usually give his own fullest solution of difficult problems magisterially as soon as he has raised his questions. He proceeds by way of successive "1 aggressions " or approximations to a solution, usually beginning witb one based on previous philosophy and accepting it for the cases which it will fairly cover before he indicates where it breaks down and attempts a newer and profounder answer. This is why he can to a large 'extent adopt the Stoic formulw ; they do cover numerous cases, ince it is genuinely the fact that much in Nature that seems evil on a narrow and contracted view will be found on a wider survey to be positively beneficial. The recurrence to the thought of the standard of the " whole " is thus justifiable as adequate in dealing with much apparent " physical evil ". But it does not meet all the cases even of " physical evil," and fails completely in dealing with " moral evil ". Plotinus does not, as Mr. Fuller seems to think, simply adopt one theory or another ad arbitrium ; he works with a " first aggression " as far as it will carry him, and then proceeds methodically to look for a more exact solution, so that his real answer to the question ro0'v rdia KaKda only .emerges at the end of a series of dialectical "aggrxessions ". Nor is it true,,again, that the final identification of the source of evil with "not- being " amounts to naturalism. Mr. Fuller seems, by pressing language, to credit both Plato and Plotinus with meaning to identify evil in the end with the non-actual, and urges against them that, except on the purely naturalistic view according to which everything actual is perfect as it stands, and only seems imperfect to us when we judge it by some arbitrary standard of reference of our own, evil ought to have a positive character " opposed to the good ". But so much is already admitted by both philosophers, since both hold that evil is actual as much as good. What they mean when they deny its reality is that whereas there is a definite principle of good there is no definite principle of evil. I.e., the better a thing is, the more individual it is, and a " most perfect being," -or principle of perfection would be the same as an absolutely complete individual, but, since the source of the imperfection of ourselves and other imperfect things lies precisely in the incompleteness of our indi- viduality, the want of full inner unity in our lives, there can be no individual principle of imperfection or " absolutely-imperfect individual ". This seems to me to be the simple truth. Put in every-day language what it means is that God is at any rate conceivable, and that God's utter individuality is part of the concept of God (Deus est suum esse) but a Manicheean devil or evil God is the purest of pseudo-concepts. There are degrees of increasing badness, no less than of increasing goodness, but whereas we can conceive the existence of an upper limit to the series of increasingly good things, we cannot form the concept of a real lower limit, a thing "so bad that nothing can be worse," or "so incoherent that nothing can be more incoherent ". Or again, the element of indeter- minateness is actual enough as axn element in everything but the Highest (this concedes to the moralist all he needs in the way of recognition that evil and sin are positive facts), but nothing actual is purely and utterly indeterminate.</page><page sequence="3">NEW BOOKS. 405 Mr. Fuller has, however, a further argument by which he intends to show a priori that any Theodicy which does not assume a fundamental metaphysical Dualism must be fallacious. He argues that you can recog- nise differences in worth between individuals of the same kind, the standard of worth being the full and complete expression of the essentia of the kind. But when you come to assert that there is a similar hierarchy of kinds you commit an illegitimate process. One thing may be more perfect in its kind than another, but of two kinds we can only say that they are different. Thus the whole conception of the different kinds of things as forming a series with the ens realissimum as its upper limit is illogical. I confess I do not see the force of this contention. May I not admit that one horse is a better specimen of a horse than another, and yet hold that the most perfect horse is of less worth in the scheme of things than the most faulty man? Is it absurd to say that " even the finest of satires is only a specimen of the least truly poetical sort of poetry? It is at least commonly assumed that such comparisons are possible, and I cannot find any reasons adduced in Mr. Fuller's book to show that the assumption is illegitimate. So far as I can see he takes his central position to be simply " evident by the natural light ". This is all the odder because this position plainly assumes the existence of "real kinds," whereas a further argument which is meant to drive Plotinus finally into a corner turns upon acceptance of the nominalist view that only the particular is real. Plotinus, says Mr. Fuller quite correctly, holds that there is not only an e4ov of man but E18n1 of all the individual men in the Universe. Ergo, he ought to have seen that any given man is at any moment perfect as an expression of his individual ,E8OS in the mere act of being himself and not some one else. Ergo, in the system of Plotinus there ought to be no room for any ethical or other progress. - Now I do not see any force at all in this reasoning. No Platonist would admit that any bare particular, as we find it here and now, is a perfect expression of its ElgOv. It is not merely that e.g. Socrates here and now is not "the perfect man," he is not even, at any particular moment, " whole and perfect Socrates ". There is " more in " Socrates than is expressed by what he is saying or doing at any moment, and the true Platonist would add, more than comes out even in the whole course of his earthly life. And common language is full of phrases which express the same conviction. We speak of a man as being " more truly himself " at some times than at others, we say: " he has put more of him- self into this piece of work than into that other," we talk of a life of promise being cut short before the deceased had become " fully himself," and so on. Will Mr. Fuller say that all this language is meaningless, and that human selfhood is bare particularity devoid of any genuinely growing content? Unlems he is ready to say this, the very sinew of his syllogism is cut through. In matters of scholarship, I should add, Mr. Fuller is by no means above suspicion. This is a pity, as it lessens the value of his book to students who cannot check his renderings of Plotinus by comparison with the Greek at the foot of the page. Thus e.g., opening the book at random, I find on page 117 the statement that " one must not expect equal perforniance from unequal beings " (ov yap ra Y(ra a7rat-ELv TEirOLS -pv) 'ltot) strangely rendered " one cannot make equality from un- equal things " (unless " make " is here a printer's error). A worse case is the translation at page 86 of ov'&amp;v yap 8,EtOV ouv 7rore 7rEpL a-csarov lrpoOarot TOOr T'rov, " there is no danger that she (the soul) will be apprehensive for such a body " as " she can never experience fear about a body of this kind". (A very elementary knowledge of Greek should have taught Mr, Fuller what ov06v 8,Evov /.L means.) On the next page a serious error in doctrine is created by the mistaking of Za-rt for a tense of</page><page sequence="4">406 NEW BOOKS. Etvac (a blunder which is made in other places as well). Plotinus says that "there is no evil" among the gods and adds Ka' EL EvrTava E'0n7T, KaKoV OZ&amp;'V GV , " if things had stopped there (i.e. if the process of "emanation " had gone no farther) evil would never have existed at all Mr. Fuller perverts this into the extraordinary sentence: " Had it (sc. evil) been there, it would not be evil ". And there are not a few other errors of the same kind. What is perhaps more serious is that Mr. Fuller's reading is not sufficient to enable him to know accurately when Plotinus is simply quoting older thinkers. Thus in the very passage just referred to, Plotinus quotes verbatim the well-known " enigma " of Plato's Second Epistle which he, rightly or wrongly, believed with the rest of antiquity to be genuine. Mr. Fuller, apparently not knowing his Plato as he should, gravely tells us (p. 89) that " this is the Aristotelian doctrine, and Plotinus is consciously a good Peripatetic" in referring to it. Finally, I must protest as emphatically as I can against the reiterated rendering of X6yov in such phrases as -7rEp,MartKos X4oyos, E'vvXot )o6yot by the senseless " reason ". The true rendering is simply law or formula. (E.g. such a formula as H2SO4 is exactly an E'vvXos Xo'yos.) A. E. TAYLOR. The Philosophical Works of Descartes. By E. S. HALDANTE and G. R. T. Ross. Vol. ii. Cambridge: University Press, 1912. Pp. viii, 380. The translators have performed a work of real service to philosophy in giving us (I believe for the first time), a complete rendering of - the Objectiones made against the Meditations with Descartes' replies. Dr. Ross appears to be responsible for the whole of the volume except the translation of Descartes' letter of expostulation on the subject of the "seventh objections," addressed to Father Dinet, S.J., Provincial of the Province of Pavia, which is signed by the initials E. S. H. It has long been a defect of English, and even of some popular French, editions of the Meditations that criticisms so important as those of Hobbes, Gassendi, and Arnauld, with Descartes' attempts to meet them, have been repre- sented by mere brief summaries, often made without an adequate insight into the precise scope of the objections. Thanks to the industry of the present translators, the English reader can now study contemporary criticism of Descartes' Metaphysics for himself. I own that, had I been executing this work on my own account, I should have been sorely tempted to omit the whole of the stupid and vulgar effusion of Father Bourdin, S.J., which figures as the "seventh objections". Bourdin's work is, as Dr. Ross intimates, absolutely worthless, and Descartes' Notes on it ore merely one long protest against being stupidly misunder- stood. The suppression of the section would have inflicted no loss on the student of Descartes, and would have provided space for the in- clusion of much more valuable matter. However, Bourdin's nonsense has obtained a traditional place in editions of the Opera Philos6phica, and this may be regarded, perhaps, as an adequate reason for its in- clusion in a translation.- The full rendering of Gassendi's penetrating criticisms and Descartes' not always satisfactory or ingenuous replies, on the other hand, should by itself make the volume valuable to all students of the " new philosophy". The translation, as a whole, may be commended as a faithful, though not always an elegant, reproduction of the original. In point of accuracy I should place it far above the previously published first volume of the work. It has also the merit of being made consistently throughout from the Latin text, variants due to the first French version being carefully</page><page sequence="5">NEW BOOKS. 40O noted at the foot of the pages. As is natural in so lengthy a work there. are slips here and there, for most of which weariness may be pleaded iDi excuse, and, owing, no doubt, to difficulties in proof-correction, a number of tiresome typographical errors have been incurred, some of which should never have been passed by the Reader of a University Press so deservedly famous as that of Cambridge. It is in no spirit of deprecia- tion, but with a view to the issuing of a possible list of Corrigenda that. I proceed to note some of these. Page 4, last sentence but one, there- is a misapprehension, probably due to the erratic punctuation of the original. The sentence should run, " It is certain that the hot, if you will concede that there is such a thing, is hot and not cold in virtue of its own internal constitutional, principles," etc. 'Page 12, last line, ha# e been is apparently a printer's error for has been. Page 24, in the first, sentence of the "second objections," a clause has somehow fallen out. At page 27, and again in Descartes' reply on page 42, there is a most un- fortunate oversight by which the colloquial phrase "sole clarius," "as plain as daylight" is completely misrendered. On page 51 a strange misconception-apparently-of the meaning of tenebr as offundere has led to a hardly intelligible rendering of the last sentence of paragraph 1, as well as to a footnote suggesting an '' emendation " which, in fact, spoils the grammar of Descartes' phrase. Page 53, line 13, "neither do we have any idea ". The word " other " has fallen out. Read " any other idea ". The construction shows that this is what Dr. Ross meant to print. Page. 61, line , for " this is the mind " read, as is clearly meant, " that is, the- mind (exists)," or "that is, I am a mind ". Page 67, line 27, portion is a printer's error for position; with reference to note 2 on page 69 the omission of a necessary non in the first edition of the Latin text was a. mere printer's error which is corrected in later Elzevir editions (at least in that of 1678 which 1 have used myself for comparison with the transla- tion). Page 80, line 13, "St. Augustine, a man of . . . such note ". Such appears to be a printer's mistake for much (Latin, plane mirandus). I could wish that at page 121, where reference is made to legends of priests who have ac-tually seen the Corpus Christi in their hands after consecration, Dr. Ross had not made Descartes speak of these tales as history. "History tells us," etc. All that the text says is memoriax proditum est, "it has been related ". We may be sure that Descartes did not regard such relations as "history," nor, I should suppose, did Arnauld Page 125, in the title of Descartes' Letter to Clerselier, solution is a vexatious misprint for selection. Page 137, line 8. Something has gone wrong in the rendering of the words et nihitominus animadvertere saltem te esse, "and yet that you recognise at least that you exist ". I do not know how this comes to, appear in the translation as " and fail utterly to notice that you . . . exist ". On the next page, in lines 26-27, there is a little awkwardness, apparently due to failure to see that the verbs of the sentence are passive. Page 140, line 10, "the souls of the brutes are incorporeal, viz., those which think," read for the last four words " inasmuch as they think " (the usual sense of the relative with a subjunctive). Page 142, line 8 from below, "give up, I pray you, that extreme dis- tinctness with which you perceive your own nature ". Latin, renuincia, quaeso quam distincte naturam tuarn perceperis, i.e. "report, I pray you, how distinctly you have perceived your own nature ". Elsewhere re- nuntiare in its primary sense is rendered quite correctly. Page 143, line 3 from below. Dr. Ross has got the best sense that can be made out of the sentence as it stands, but I would suggest that in the words nisi sola incursione fiat, nisi may be a "primitive error" of</page><page sequence="6">408 NEW BOOKS. Gassendi or his printer for (non) nisi, the sense being " since knowledge only enters by a sort of invasion, though it is elaborated," etc. I think this more conformable to the known opinions of Gassendi as well as better Latin than the printed text, and the dropping of non is a mistake of which there are several instances in the early editions of the Objections. Page 155, line 4, a not has been omitted by oversight; read, "those Ideas nevertheless (do not) prove," etc. (non tamen arguere). Page 161, line 6, the words as long as should be deleted. What follows, "you decrease the image's reality," is the grammatical and logical conse- quent in the sentence. The meaning is that on any theory which denies that " ideas " are corporeal effluxes from things, the reality of the idea is of a lower degree than on the corporeal effluence theory of Epicurus-and Gassendi. Page 190, note 2. No " emendation" is called for. Sigillatim, which Descartes almost certainly wrote, is only a very common MSS. mis- spelling of singillatim, not a different word. Page 195, line 20. " But, how, 0 Mind," etc. Surely how is a printer's mistake for iow. The sentence also appears not to be meant as a ques- tion. Render, as Dr. Ross very possibly wrote, " But now . . . there is no difficulty ". Page 197, line "is that why," etc. Read simply, " have you a clear and distinct idea about this?" (idcirco, viz., a clear and distinct idea of what it is to be unextended). Page 200, note 1, the reference should be to Lucretius I., 305. Page 293, line , " each enjoys' his own sensation ". Rather " his own conviction" (L., suo sensu abundat), Gassendi, means that he is content to leave other men to be as partial as they like to their own favourite philosophies, so long as they will leave him to enjoy his own. Page 233, line 3. " I catch sight of the real Gassendi, and have ground for suspecting that he is a man of great philosophical eminence. Translation, " and look ul) to him as a man," etc., Dr. Ross forgets that suspicio rarely or never means "to suspect," except in the participle. Page 367, note . The note is uinfortunately worded. The Latin for Utrecht is not, of course, Ultrajectinae but Ultrajecttm; ultrajecti9ius is an adjective like Florentinus or Byzantinus. Moreover the case of the adjective to be supplied in the place of Descartes' asterisks is the genitive singular masculine (ludicium sub nomine Senatus Academbici [Ultr a- jectini] editum). It will be seen that the number of necessary emendations I have to submit is not large for a volume of nearly 400 large octavo pages, and that most of them deal with what are obviously typographical errors. A. E. TAYLOR. Pr oceedings of the Aristotelian Society, 1911-1912. Published by Williams &amp; Norgate. Pp. 345. The Pr-oceeditgs of this society for the past year are somewhat swollen hy the presence of two Symposia-one on " The Time Difficulty in Realist 'Theories of Perception " and the other on " Mechanism and Purpose ". In the first of these the question is whether the fact that we ' see a star' by light which it emitted some time before the moment of our perception is compatible with the view that we really become directly aware of the star itself. Mr. Carr, who opens the discussion, very unnecessarily drags in Einstein and the theory of relativity. He holds that the real question is</page><page sequence="7">NEW BOOKS. 409 'where our perceptions can be'. As he says that on the realist theory they must be where the astronomical star is, he apparently means percepts by perceptions. He further holds that the timne-interval makes it obvious that they cannot be at the astronomical star but must be in the perceiver. Otherwise they must exist before they are perceived, which he holds to be self-contradictory. But it is certainly not self-contradic- tory that a percept should exist unperceived, for the realist theory holds that precisely the same things exist sometimes perceived and somiietimes unperceived. Nor is it self-contradictory that a perception should exist unperceived; for, except when we deliberately introspect, all our percep: tions are in this state. The real point at issue is in fact a very simple one, and deals with time and not directly with space. It is just this: It seerns obvious that the existence of an object of direct awareness is con- temporary with the existence of the awareness of it. If the usual inter- pretation of physical thoories be right it would be possible to have a perception due to a distant source of light at a finite time after that source had ceased to exist. Hence the object of this perception cannot be identical with the source of light wlhich causes the perception. But naive realism asserts this identity. Mr. Carr's solution is based on Bergson, and, in common with the other participants in the Symposium. I am quite unable to follow it. I also subscribe most heartily to Dr. Dawes Hicks' criticisms of Bergson's apparent attempt to identify colours with vibrations. As far as I can see the crux of Mr. Canr's argument consists in the romark : 'If you object that the image }lo longer exists when you are perceiving it, you are bound to hold that no movement exists because the part accomplished has ceased to be and the part in progress is not yet'. If this be meant as an argument to show that we must assume that the past exists in some sense, I agree that it does : it still exists, but its existence which was present has become past. But this does not answer the question whetlher there can be a perception of an existent whose existence is not contemporary with that of the perception itself. And this is really the question at issue. If I had to defend naive realism I should take the line that a present perception can have a past existent for its object and then try to show how it is that we make an erroneous judgment as to their temporal relations. Prof. Jevons discusses the question on the lines that the star that sends out the light is a concept and that which is seen is a percept. This seem-s to me to amount to an admission that the difficulty is fatal to naive realism, for what is perceived is not the concept, whilst it is the concept that the realist wants us to perceive. The most exciting solution is that of Dr. Dawes Hicks, who holds that in all cases what we perceive is the sun as it is when we receive the light, though the stimulus comes from the sun as it was earlier. If in the meanwhile the sun has been annihilated we do not perceive anything in spite of the arrival of the stimulus from the past sun. I agree with Mr. Carr that this view makes the whole supposition that the past sun had has anything to do with the causation of our perception of the present one very arbitrary. Suppose that the sun exploded at a certain moment and that by the time the light sent out just before the explosion reached us pieces of it were widely distributed. Should we see them all in the positions they had reached ? If not, how little must the present sun differ from the past one in order that a stimulus from the past one may enable us to see it? And in general, if Dr. Hicks's account be true, I do not see what evidence remains that light has a velocity at all. The usual ground for supposing that it has a velocity is aberration; but I do not see that there would be aberration on Dr. Hick's view-or, rather, some</page><page sequence="8">410 NEW BOOKS. explanation would be needed for that phenomenon which would cease to, make it available as evidence for the finite velocity of light. Mr. Russell contributes an important paper on "Universals and. Particulars ". He investigates the question whether we can dispense- with universals or with particulars. He shows that at any rate we must assume universal relations on pain of a vicious infinite regress, and then there is no advantage in denying universal qualities. With regard to uni- versals he shows that even in perceptual space there exist relations (like 'inside') which imply diversity in their terms and yet can relate terms that, are conceptually identical. Hence you can have numerical difference with conceptual identity, and so you must distinguish betweein a universal and its particular instances. The paper contains much interesting discussion as. to the nature of purely sensible extension as distinct from the intellectu-- ally constructed space which synthesises the several sensible spaces, and is as such never directly perceived. There is a good article by Dr. Nunn on Animism and Energy. He traces the development of the conservation view from pure mechanics to physics and thence to metaphysics. He insists on -what seems to me to be the most important point, that it is of no use to save the Conservation of Energy in the interest of mechanics unless you also save the Conserva- tion of Momentum, a thing which all guidance theories ex hypothesi fail to do. Dr. Nunn holds that in the physical sense of Conservation- all that is needed is that two classes of events, e.g., one defined by the fact that i MV2 = K, and another defined by the fact that the heat, liberated is constant, shall be capable of correlation. If then we could get classes of naental events which would be correlated in this way with- physical classes Conservation would hold even if there were interaction. He thinks that the determining mark of such classes need not be the^ constance of some quantity, but he does not indicate how we are to form our psychical classes, and so the discussion is somewhat in the air. In the Symposium on Purpose and Mechanism, Profs. Sorley, Bosanquet and Ward, and Mr. Lindsay took part. It is not possible to summarise such a long discussion, which came to involve the question in what sense purpose can be applied to the whole universe. Profs. Ward and Bosanquet join issue as to whether finite purpose is enough and as to whether there is any genuine mechanism, but neither has. persuaded the other. What is curious is how very materialistically some of Prof. Bosanquet's pronouncements read. There are two papers on Logic, one on Memory and Imagery, a de- seription of Prof. Santayana's Life of Reason, and a long paper on ' The Experience of Power' in which Prof. Boyce Gibson introduces us to two French philosophers, Maine de Biran and De Tracy. On the- whole, a quit'e entertaining volume of Proceedings of which the Society has no cause to be ashamed. C. D. BROAD. The Psychotogy of Insanity. By BERNARD HART, M.D. Published in- Cambridge Science and Literature Series. In this little book the author gives an account of recent psychological theory of insanity, modified in certain respects by the results of his own. experience with the insane. The hypotheses of Freud form the basis of the theory advanced, though it is also indebted to Jung and Trotter, the author criticising freely where the facts seem to require it. An interest- ing feature of the result is that the consideration of physiological con- ditions obtaining in insanity is entirely elimiiinated. Attention is confined.</page><page sequence="9">NEW BOOKS. 411 to the " conscious processes " to be found in deranged minds, the aim being to "describe " these " conveniently and comprehensively". The most general characteristic of the very diverse phenomena which must be subsumed under the term " insanity " is " dissociation of con- sciousness ". By this is meant a " division of the mind into independent fragments, Which are not co-ordinated together to attain some common end " (p. 42). Slight dissociation is a frequent occurrence in normal life, as, for example, when one simultaneously plays the piano and worries over an ethical problem. In cases of lunacy the dissociation is frequently manifested as a complete break in the stream of consciousness. An in- sane person is at one moment a clergyman, at another a shopkeeper, the transition from -the one role to the other being instantaneous and com- plete. A more precise definition of dissociation of conscionsness is thus reached. " A system of ideas is said to be dissociated w hen it is divorced from the personality, and when its course and development are exempt from the control of the personality " (p. 52). "Systems of ideas," briefly termed " complexes," are then considered. A "complex" has an emotional tone and tends to produce a definite kind of action. Each complex is a centre of " force ". When complexes "con- flict " a variety of rcsults may follow, a particular result being dependent on the character and strength of the complexes involved. Sometimes an individual countenances a complex which conflicts with his personality by "1 glossing " or "rationalising" " its precise import. In the case of the logically minded or morally sensitive, or again when the conflicting com- plex is of considerable extent, "rationalisation" is impossible. The complex is then " repressed ". The author's thesis is that no complex is ever literally annihilated; and that, if of sufficient strength,it frequen- tly rises and takes complete control of consciousness. Hence are to be explained such phenomena as double personality, etc. Great emphasis is laid upon the conception of " repressed complexes," and it is held that a very large number of phenomena, superficially di- verse, may be explained by its application. It is usually supposed, for instance, that a lunatic is irrational. In answer to this it is pointed out, first, that normal rational conduct proceeds from complexes, of the exis- tence of which individuals may be ignorant, but which form the premisses which justify the conduct. If, then, a lunatic is impervious to logic, we are to suppose the existence of " re-pressed complexes," which for some reason it is not desired should be made public, but which yield a positive proof to the lunatic that the arguments stated to him are fallacious. That is to say, the lunatic is not really an irrational person; his apparent irrationality is due to the fact that we are ignorant of his premisses. Again: the hallucinations of the lunatic are supposed to be the " voice " of a "repressed complex". The interpretation of malicious intentioni which, in certain cases of insanity, the subjects put upon the conduct of certain persons, independent of the particular character of such conduct, finds a similar explanation. The subject is presented in a straightforward and vigorous style, which is very appropriate to the requirements of the layman,-as it was meant to be. The scope of the-book necessitates the omission of a number of questions, which are, nevertheless, of the first importance. For instance, practically nothing is said concerning the origin of com- plexes. This should be a very fruitful field for investigation. Dr. Hart begins from the fact that complexes, having certain relations to one an- other, do exist, and upon this basis explanation proceeds. A most im- portant question is: Is it possible to discover the factors in the production of a certain set of complexes, exercising contrary forces of differing strengths, in the one mind? Again, we may ask: Why is it that cer-</page><page sequence="10">412 NEW BOOKS. tain complexes in one mind do not conflict, while complexes essentially similar to them in another mind, do conflict? Are complexes themselves the source of their motor tendencies, or is this to be found in something which also leads to the production of the complexes? Again: What is the process which leads to the repression of a complex ? Such are some of the questions which naturally arise from the facts and from the theory which Dr. Hart puts forward. It need hardly be added that certain psychologists will disagree about the elimination of physiology; but this will p-obably be due to a difference in aim. Though intended as a popular exposition the book is an excellent intro- duction to a fuller study of the psychology of insanity. BERNEARD MUSOIO. Sociology in its Psychological Aspects. By CHARLES A. ElLwoOD, Ph.D., Professor of Sociology in the University of Missouri. New York and London: D. Appleton &amp; Co., 1912. Pp. xi, 417. Dr. Ellwood has set out to write an "Iintroduction to the psychological theory of society ". He holds that "t the development of sociology must de- pend upon the development of psychology ". But " hitherto psychologists have been more concerned with analysing the structure of human conscious- ness than with developing a psychology of human action. The latest developments in psychology are, however, developments towards such a psychology of human activities or behaviour; and it cannot be doubted that when such a psychology has been fully developed, that (sic) it will supply the missing key for the interpretation of social phenomena " (pp. 94- 95). "A society... is a group of individuals carrying on a collective life by means of mental interaction " (p. ix), and Dr. Ellwood somewhat dogmati- eally asserts that "' it is the interrelations thiemselves, not their products, which the sociologist is primarily interested in. What he investigates is not so much the organisations and institutions of society as the associational processes which lie back of these, the processes of individual interaction which constitute them " (p.15). Accordingly the greater part of sociology is simply social psychology, or " psychological sociology " as the author prefers to call it. This is not indeed the whole of sociology, " for sociology has also important biological aspects ". There are thus two divisions of sociology, biological and psychological. Dr. Ellwood concerns himself with the latter division, and his investigations into it lead him to discuss the r6les of instinct, feeling, and intellect respectively in the social life, the nature of social mind, the forms of association, the "' theory of social order," and in a concluding chapter the '" nature of society ". There is a great tangle to be straightened out here. (1) "The social," in Dr. Ellwood's own words, is that which involves the psychic interaction of two or more individuals " (p. 16). If so, what of the distinction between "biological" and " psychological sociology"? Biological factors would thus enter into account only as affecting the psychical interactions of social beings, and would in this respect be on a par with, say, geographical factors, which also affect the psychical interactions of men. But then biological as distinct from psychofogical sociology becomes meaningless. (2) It is extraordinarily difficult to see how, on his premises, Dr. Ellwood can distinguish between sociology and psychology proper. Here is his own account of the distinction: "The distinction then between sociology and psychology is the same as that between all other sciences-it is funda- mentally a distinction of problems. . The problems of the psychologist are those of consciousness, of the individual mind, as we commonly say; 1 Author's italics throughout.</page><page sequence="11">NEW BOOKS. 413 while the problems of the sociologist are those of the interaction of indi- viduals and the evolution of social organisation. To put it in other language, the distinction between sociology and psychology is one of point of view. The psychological point of view is the individual and his experi- ences; the sociological point of view is social organisation and its changes. Whatever, then, aims at explaining the psychical nature of the individual, is psychological; while whatever aims at explaining the nature of society is sociological " (p. 59). Nothing could well be more confusing in itself or more directly contradictory of the statement (already quoted) that the " primary interest " of the sociologist is not the organisations of society but rather "the processes of individual interaction which constitutes them ". Since nearly all the mental life of the individual is developed through and determined by social relations, we cannot possibly distinguish between " the processes of individual interaction," the concern of the soci- ologist, and " the experiences of the individual " (what experiences ?)-the concern of the psychologist. (3) Whatever be the primary interest of sociology, it must at all events have for one interest the results of the mental interactions of individuals, in the forms of social organisation, institutions of all kinds, systems of law and government, and so forth. These resultant social unities are not in any sense processes of psychical interaction. If the investigation of these facts is a psychological study, all sciences, the study of all human- activities whatever, must be counted psychology, and the distinction "psychological" loses its meaning. It will be evident that Dr. Ellwood has not devoted sufficient thought to an analysis of the foundation of his argument. Unfortunately the same hastiness characterises the book throughout. Psychological terms are used in a loose and unsatisfactory manner in passages where precision is essential. In the chapter on the " r6le of instinct in the social life" we have such naive statements as the following: "Just what beliefs in human society may be traced to an instinctive origin and what to other sources, psychologists as yet are hardly prepared to say " ! In the chapter on the " r68le of intellect "-as distinct from those of feeling and instinct -the author speaks of " the individual intellect in its forms of imagination, reason and ideals "! These are by no ineans isolated examples. Perhaps the most curious instance of loose thinking is the footnote to page 367: " The purpose of this chapter is, of course, not to show that social progress is ethically desirable, but, assuming that it is desirable, to analyse the conception of social progress," etc. I There is nothing in what follows to indicate that Dr. Ellwood is not using the expression " social progress.' in its proper ethical significance. It seems clear at all points that more rigorous thinking is essential before the author, who has certainly made an extensive and impartial study of sociological literature, can ever make any real coltribution to sociological science. R. M. MAcIVER. IntroductoryPhilosophy, a Text-book for Colleges and .High Schools. By CHARLES DUBRAY, Ph.D. Longman, 1912. Pp. 624. 10s. 6d. net., This is the work of a Catholic priest, professor in a Seminary at Wash- ington. It embraces Empirical Psychology, Logic, AEsthetics, Ethics, Rational Psychology, Theodicy, and Outlines of History of Philosophy. The treatment is comprehensive, without being shallow; faithful to the tradition of the Middle Ages, while mainly regarding modern thought. The author shows a laudable concern to stimulate thought in his youth- ful readers. What is wanted of them, before they go to listen to a Univer- sity lecturer on philosophy, is a generally accurate knowledge of the sub- ject in its various branches, along with some capacity of serious reading</page><page sequence="12">414 NEW BOOKS. and consecutive thinking. What is not wanted in them at any time, but -a thing they easily fall into, is an aptitude to reproduce the stock language of deep thinkers with little or no real appreciation of the meaning. This knowledge Dr. Dubray supplies, and against this danger he fortifies. He has produced therefore an excellent book for the hobbledehoy be- tween school and university. Neither is it a work for learners only. A university lecturer will find it an excellent book of reference. The mountain heights of Hegel are safer when the climber descends at times, and takes a walk on the level with the plain man, especially that sturdy tramp named Aristotle, whom Dr. Dubray chiefly follows. A book like this exposes so much surface as to be an easy field for criti- cism. Thus we read concerning the Platonic Idea: 'the highest idea -is God' (p. 552). So St. Augustine certainly: but if Plato thought so, he never wrote it. Again, is there not a contradiction in the following? ' Could not God have created a world in which there would be less evil, less suffering, and less sin? We do not know . . . the world is good -without being the best possible. . . . God chose the present order'. If this world is not the the best possible, God could have created a better; -and in a better world, presumably, there would have been less evil. The matter at least requires further elucidation. Writing from the camp of -the Dynamists, we avow ourselves wholly untouched by Dr. Dubray's mnissile against Dynamism: ' Dynamism cannot explain real extension, etc.' (p. 429). Not the extension of continuous matter, certainly; that is just -what the Dynamist declares an impossibility. Extension according to him is a property of space, marked by matter, matter being phenomenally con- tinuous, noumenally discontinuous, dotted up and down in space, and hav- ing its place there. The Aristotelian school, so the Dynamist will tell Dr. Dubray, confounds space with place, which is a confusion of infinite with finite. The universe as a whole has its place, which place is probably moving in space, a movement however impossible for any man to mark. As for actio in distans, that is largely a question of language. Instead of 'point-centre of force' say 'centered sphere of activity,' and the diffi- culty vanishes. Thus much to show that, as might have been anticipated, Dr. Dubray's comprehensive survey touches on themes of discussion mani- fold. That indeed is the beauty of philosophy. It will not go all into one book, no, not ten thousand volumes. The following is a favourable specimen of Dr. Dubray's manner, and what we may call the 'American shrewdness' which pervades him through- *out:- '(a) The agnostic attitude is attractive on account of its apparent hu- inrility. In reality it incltAdes a great presumption, that of determining 'exactly how far human reason can go. There is some humility in saying, "I- do not know, " but it is quite different to say: " It is unknowable ". '(b) In fact, how can one say of a thing that it is unknowable without ,having made a comparison of it with the capacity of the human mind, and therefore without having already some accurate knowledge, not only of the mind's power, but also of the object which is supposed to transcend -this power? ' (c) Can we know theexistence of a thing, and at the same time be -utterly ignorant of its nature ? " This, of course, does not end the matter. It is easy to frame a reply on the part of the agnostic. But Dr. Dubray's aim is not to close, but to -open discussion. JOSEPH RICKABY.</page><page sequence="13">NEW BOOKS. 415 The Beyond that is Within. By EMiLB BOUTROUX. Translated by Jonathan Nield. London: Duokworth &amp; Co., 1912. Pp. xiv, 138. 3s. 6d. net. This is an excellent volume. It consists of three essays, dealing respec- tively with the relations between science and human activity, morality and religion, science and philosophy; the result being to show intercon- nexion throughout. In the first essay, which gives the title to the book, M. Boutroux asks if there are evidences in us of something which is beyond, or not of one piece with, science. The result of the dis&amp;tssion is to vindicate the right of,art, morality and religion as against science, by showing, on Kantian lines, that-the scientific conceptions themselves rest on something deeper. What this something deeper is, is shown in the "veritable creation' which takes place in the adaptation of " hard" conceptions to intuition, which goes beyond them, and can never be completply exhausted by them. The power which thus joins conception with intuition is essentially the same as "life," the "free activity" of man, which is "creative," and finds its outlet in art and morality. We may perhaps interpret M. Bou- troux's position by a reference to Kant. - The central thesis set forth in the Subjective Deduction of the Categories is accepted as the starting point, and Kant's " blind but indispensable " faculty of imagination is shown to be that essentially creative power which we call life, and which, at its highest level, is reason conceived as the union of thought and action. What produces objectivity in the field of science, produces objectivity also in all its activities; and the result of its activity is not merely a phenomenal world over against a noumenal, but reality itself. This is developed in the two succeeding essays. Morality derives its precepts from something beyond scientific experience. But it cannot be regarded as self-contained. Morality not only implies a faith that its ideals are capable of being realised; it implies further the actual exist- ence of something corresponding to these ideals. We are thus led on from morality to religion; and M. Boutroux shows how the ideals of morality have indeed come from religion. Morality and religion are thus not an- tagonistic, but neither are they identical. " From religion proceed, as from a life-giving and creative principle, those ideal conceptions of human destiny, those generous enthusiasms, those impetuous yearnings after what is unknown, those strong and tireless energies in pursuit of a super- human perfection, which uplitt humanity, and urge it to endless strife with things and with itself. Morality constitutes the reflexion of reason 'on the manifestations of religious enthusiasm . . . " (p. 93). In the third essay the relation between philosophy and science is dis- cussed. There is not one science, but many; and each science rests on its own postulates, which are supplied by intuition. When we examine the postulates of the various sciences, these turn out to be just the postulates implied in all action. Thus the sciences and human action spring from a common root reason; and hence, though human action falls outside of science, science has no right to deny it value or reality. "That which characterises reason, that which constitutes truly its essence and its value, is its capacity of blending into an indis- soluble whole, the conditions of action and those of knowledge . . . . She represents, in herself, intellect in immediate contact with being, thought secretly one with action" (p. 127). And consequently, "If reason, thus understood, is justified in the eyes of a reflection which starts from consideration of the positive sciences, the speculations which express the life and the development of that reason are themselves legitimate. Now, these speculations are nothing else than what is called Philosophy " (p.</page><page sequence="14">416 NEW BOOKS. 128). An excellent discussion follows, of the search for a concept which shall express adequately the relation between philosophy and the sciences; we find it, it is suggested, in the notion of solidarity. Mr. Nield's translation is extremely good. It reproduces faithfully the spirit of M. Boutroux's writing, without any of the awkward constructions so often met with in a translation. May we suggest that the words " ex- ternal relations," on the last line of page 131, should be avoided, as having misleading associations? What M. Boutroux seems to be referring to is some such thing as " the relations which things appear at first sight to have ". LEONARD J. RUSSELL. The Meaning of Christianity. By FREDmicRI A. M. SPENcER, M.A. London: T. Fisher Unwin, 1912. Pp. 420. Price 7s. 6d. net. The modest name of this ambitious book is a sign of the times. N few generations ago it would have been entitled Snmma Theologic. It runs through the whole gamut of theological questions from the genesis of religion to eschatology.' It is essentially reconstructive. It' seeks to " correct and develop," with reference to modern scientific and psychical research, the views of the Gospels and the Fathers. It quotes with Catholic appreciation Origen and Oliver Lodge, St. John and Prof. James. On almost every page one discerns Mr. Spencer's efforts to blend the orientation of a scientist with the temperament of a prophet. The argument may be briefly stated. Religion is activity of souls which is manifested in the spiritual life. The spiritual life is a natural extension of the life which appears on different levels in animals and men. In man we find indications of the spiritual life which point to its complete realisation. Is the present dispensation favourable to the growth of the spiritual life ? The discussion' of this question leads through chapters on God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, Sin, Atonement, Grace, Institutions of Christianiity and the End of the World. The evolution of humanity will gradually lead to spiritual expansion. So far, Mr. Spencer's frank and undogmatic treatment has been illuminated by real religious enthusiasm. But in the remaining chapters that same enthusiasm leads him to promulgate strange views in a singularly dogmatic strain. Kant in his Anthropologie draws an interesting distinction between prophecy and soothsaying. We would fain class Mr. Spencer among the prophets, But Kant would not agree with us. A German librarian would have some difficulty in deciding whether to class the book as Theologie or Geheimwissenschaft. Mr. Spencer is quite familiar with the after-life. All souls attain immor- tality. It is "far more certain," than the universal validity o inatural laws that souls pass through many incarnations. These incarnations take place in the same globe, and the souls alternate between male and female bodies in order to develop male and female qualities. The book ends with an edifying vision of the Kingdom of God, realised on this globe, and tenanted by these hermaphroditic souls. If Mr. Spencer advanced even plausible grounds for the immortality of the soul (the keystone of his system) he would have a certain justification for erect- ing his own theories on that supra-Stygian arch. But the following arguments will show the quality of his reasoning: "If there were no experience for an Ego, at least there would be lack of experience for that Ego" (p. 358). "An Ego is indestructible. It remains as the eternal possibility of consciousness " (p. 359). " Were the self to suffer real annihilation, there would be nothing to occasion the sense of all not</page><page sequence="15">NEW BOOKS. 417 being well, when a soul had died" (p. 359). In every case, the fallacy is painfully obvious. The weakest strand in the book is its treatment of the Author of Christianity. In a long chapter on " The Resurrection," the reader will find not the slightest hint that the Gospels contain any suggestion that Christ rose from the dead. So, in the chapter on "The Atonement," we have an abundance of instances of conversion, from St. Paul to Pre- sident Finney, but only a cursory reference to Christ's own consciousness of the meaning of the atonement. A book which consistently minimises the fact of Christ can hardly hope to be an adequate exposition of the meaning of Christianity, even for the " modern mind ". G. A. JOEM.STOr. Psychology. A New System Based on the Study of the Fundamental Processes of the Human Mind. By ARTHuR LYNCH, M.A., C.E., I.R.C.P., M.R.C.S.E., M.P. London: Stephen Swift &amp; Co., Ltd. 2 vols. Pp. xxiv, 378; xv, 379-814. Price, 10s. 6d., net, each. About two such pretentious volumes as these a few words must be said, although one would prefer to lay them aside without comment. The Fundamental Processes are twelve in number: Immediate Presentation, Conception of Unit, Memory, Association, Agreement, Generalisation, Feeling of Effort, Impulse, Hedonic Sense, Sense of Negation, Con- ception of Time, Conception of Space. " It is impossible to refer to any one of the Fundamental Processes without reference to others. Nevertheless they are distinct." The first volume contains chapters on The Fundamental Process; The Conception' of Unit; Addition, Substraction, Multiplication, etc.; Operations with Spatial Rela- tions; The Axioms; New Views of Geometry; Problems of in- finity and Imaginaries; Examination of Fechner's Law; Memory and Reason. Volume ii. discusses Questions of Research, The ex- tended operation of reason in Scientific fields, Association, Externality, Ego and Will, Dreams, Physiology and Psychology, Reciprocal Inter- pretations of Physiology and Psychology, The Feeling of Effort, The' Development of Psychology, and Indications of Progress. The scientific standard of the book may be gathered from certain sentences, which appear amongst the copious notes to the text: " In the preceding account of memory I have relied as far as possible on my own observations and experiments, for beyond that lay a perilous sea of literature " (p. 305) ; " The references [to the literature concerning dreams] in standard works of general psychology are too numerous to admit of mention " (p. 618). Stilly one may admire the diligence the author has displayed in writing up the names of the writers and the titles of works dealing with so many subjects, in so many languages, from so many journals and years.

This book works over a number of the main topics connected with the general psychology of music, but it can hardly be said to add anything to 27</page><page sequence="16">418 NEW BOOKS. our knowledge of them or to make them more approachable. The con- fusingly reiterative design of the book detracts much from any intro- ductory value it might have. The psychology of rhythm upon which it is founded is both amateurish and vicious. "The dimensions of what can be grasped in one intuitive act of thought" is " the Unit of Thought ". That is the bar, although "it manifests an external instability which drives the musical sense to balance it by movement to a second bar". "There is only one simple metre, and all others are compounded of various arrangements and values of this. This basic metre is called Duple." " Triple metre is obtained by associating in regular sequence two duples of different value whose periods are in the proportion of two to one, or one to two." This "ttheoretical and abstract " Part I. is followed by Part II., Practical and Concrete, where we read that " the unit of speed must be understood as the dimension of the bar as thought by the Composer-not necessarily as written ". " All quick movements which have only one beat in the bar as written-such as most Scherzos, ~etc.-have a real bar made up of contrasted strong and weak beats, which is worth two or more of the bars as written. In a similar manner, in slow time the bar as written is often equivalent to two or more real bars." Prof. McEwen's efforts to indicate the real rhythmical effect of the Scherzo of Beethoven's Choral Symphony, of Mozart's Sonata in C Minor, and of Bach's 22nd fugue (vol. ii. of the well-tempered Olavier) will hardly meet with hearty acceptance. All cases where the unit of thought seems to be longer or smaller than two beats or bars are examples of augmentation or diminution of the unit of thought. The true rhythmic progression is, moreover, from weak to strong. It may seem not to be so in any particular example, such as the opening of Beethoven's Sonata Appassionata, but it really is so, and in performance this must be realised and displayed. The phrase, whose normal form is said to be four bars, is treated after the same methods. It may seem to be other- wise according to Beethoven, Schubert, Brahms, etc., but that is only because we see them through the clerical conventions which bound them. First Book in Psychology. By M.

New York: The Macmillan Co. 1912. Pp. xxvi, 577. Price'$2.50 net. The first edition of Prof. Calkin's Psychology was reviewed in MIND for October, 1911. The revision emphasises the essentially social nature of the conscious sell (the contents of the chapter formerly devoted to the ' social consciousness' have therefore been transferred to other portions of the book), accentuates the fact that the study of the self, as thus conceived, involves a study of behaviour, and does away with certain expressions that might be interpreted in terms of an atomistic psychology. The principal changes of doctrine occur in the discussions of attention, of the analysis of will, and of the time-consciousness. The Problems of Philosophy was reviewed in MINTD for July, 1907. The new edition relates the conclusions of the work to the more recent of contemporary philosophical writings, and in particular refers to the arguments against idealism urged by the 'Ineo-realists'. Attention is called to two points of terminology: the distinction between 'qualita- tively' and ' numerically' pluralistic or monistic systems, and the use of the term 'idealism' in the widest possible sense to mean 'the conception of reality as of the nature of consciousness'.</page><page sequence="17">NEW BOOKS. 419 Mind and Its Disorders. A Text-Book for Practitioners and Students. By W. H. B. STODDART, M.D., F.R.C.P. Second Edition with Illus- trations. London: H. K. Lewis, 1912. Pp. xvi and 518. This is the second edition of a work noticed in a former number of MIND. So rapid is the accumulation of material that, although the first edition appeared little more than three years ago, some additions have been found necessary. The chief additions are two chapters on Psycho-analysis-the psychopathology of the Freudian school. The author 4aso states that " Part III. has been re-arranged in such a way as to establish more clearly the similarity of the various toxic psychoses ". It may be said that, as compared with twenty years ago, the new notes of the study of morbid psychology are the methods of the Freudian school and the toxic psychoses. It is almost unnecessary to repeat that the volume is an excellent text-book of Insanity. W. L. M. La Vr aie I?ducation. By PAUL GAULTIER. Paris. Hachette &amp; Cie. Pp. 284. This is a well-written and refreshing book upon an old subject. In more ways than one the author recalls the wisdom of Plato. By education he means " la formation de l'esprit et du corps dans leur integralite et leur harmonie". This definition itself carries with it the fragrance of Hellas " en un temps ofu l'on confond volontiers l'6ducation avec l'instruction et l'instruction elle-meme avec un entassement de cornaissances, dans la majorite des cas purement verbales. " Two sentences in the introduction are worth quoting side by side: "L'education ne peut s'operer h vide, demeurer exclusivement formelle" "De m8me, on apprend A etre fort, A aimer et A vouloir le bien. VoilI l'essentiel." In four consecutive chapters M. Gaultier discusses The Education of the Body, the Education of the Feelings, the Education of Intelligence, and the Education of the Will. He makes clear, however, at the outset that " le corps n'est pas separe de l'ame . . . Il est cette ame meme incarnee rendue sensible A tous, apercue, pour ainsi dire, du dehors. Aussi bien l'esprit beneficie de ce qui profite A l'organisme, patit de ce qui 1'e6tiole." And in his concluding chapter he definitely asserts: "Le corps, la sensibilite, l'intelligence et la volontd doivent etre cultives ensemble. Nous n'avons traite separement de leur formation que pour les commo- dites de l'etude." The great end of education ought to be the formation of complete beings: " des femmes et des hommes de occur, robustes, intelligents et forts ". The educator must therefore utilise as much as possible the common elements in human nature to form men and women worthy of the name. Our author would on this,account simplify instruction: " L'enseignement qu'il soit litteraire ou scientifique, doit etre simplifie, reduit A l'essentiel, aux grandes lignes." At the same time he provides for the utilisation of individual excellencies. "A chacun son originalite. " JoN EDGAR.</page><page sequence="18">420 NEW BOOKS. Le Conflit de la Morale et de la Sociologie. Par SIMON DEPLOIGE, Pr6sident de l'Institut Superieur de Philosophie (Universite Catholique de Louvain). Second ed. Louvain and Paris, 1912. Pp. xvi, 424. This work aroused much interest in certain circles in France and Belgium when it first appeared early in 1911, and already a second edition has been published. The only addition consists in a preface in which the author takes the opportunity to reply to a critic of the Revue de Mgtaphysique et de Morale. Mgr. Deploige's book is essentiallyi a criticism of the sociological method and postulates of M. Durkheim and his school. This school holds, according to M. Deploige, that one must choose between ethics and sociology-as a matter of fact even the extremer members of the school, such as M. Levy-Brulhl, say only that the opposition lies between " theoretic " or a priori ethics and " scientific " ethics based on sociology. M. Deploige sets out to show that there is no such conflict; that there is only a factitious opposition due to one-sided systems both of ethics and sociology. To prove his pointhe analyses-very cogently and on the whole impartially-the system of M. Durkheim. He then proceeds to trace its source in German thought-though M..Durkheim, who ought perhaps to know, denies the paternity which M. Deploige provides. Finally the author points out that in the Thomist system there can be found the solution of all M. Durkheim's difficulties. It is a little curious to find Mgr. Deploige offering to MM. Durkheim, Levy Bruhl, and company the system of St. Thomas as a terrain de ralliement. It was hardly necessary to go to the Summa Theologica to prove that there is no essential opposition between ethics and sociology. But the work, given its presuppositions, is very well done. R. M. MAcIVER. La Sophistique Contemporaine: petit examen de' la philosophie de mon temps. Par GnORuGES DUMESNI. Paris: JBeauchesne et Cie., 1912. Pp. 116. M. Dumesnil begins by disclaiming any invidious implications which may cling to the word. "sophistique ". French philosophy appears to him to be in a similar position to Greek philosophy in the time of Socrates, and, he here presents II les notes d'un philosophe tout a fait hors de mode, fpuisqu'il est socratisant ". More than half the book is taken up by a criticism of Bergson, a few pages are given to Chide; they are the repre- sentatives of metaphysic. Next we find brief studies of H. Poincar6 and Milhaud as typical of the position of science ; then a somewhat longer criticism of the ethical views of Rauh and Levy-Bruhl. In the conclud- ing section on religion M. Dumesnil sets forth his aim, which is to vindicate the orthodox Roman Catholic position against the tendencies of anti-conceptualism. Modernism is set aside; the encyclical Pascendi has, it appears, settled that question. The science of religion is held to be based on the erroneous assumption that every religion is social by essence and by origin; its students aim at suppressing all religion. But M. Dumesnil holds that the Catholic Religion has a character which dis- tinguishes it radically from other religions: " la religion catholique est la seule qui parle; elle est la Religio sapiens As a piece of criticism this book is neither sufficiently exhaustive nor sufficiently radical. But it is pleasant reading, and M. Dumesnil is evidently not one of those who, like Johnson's friend Edwards, have</page><page sequence="19">NEW BOOKS. 421 been hindered from becoming philosophers because " cheerfulness would always keep breaking in ". ARTHUR ROBINSON. PTincipien dcer Metaphysik. Von Branislav Petronievics. Erster Band. Zweite Abteilung. Die realen Kategorien und die letzten Princi- pien. Heidelberg: Carl Winter's Universitatsbuchhandlung. Pp. xxxviii, 570. The first part of the first volume of this monumental work was reviewed some years ago in this journal. Its successor is divided into two sections, the first of which deals with metaphysical questions, the seco:nd with hypermetaphysical. By metaphysics, the author means a thorough in- quiry into the constitution of the actual universe; by hypermetaphysics the inquiry into the constitution of any conceivable universe. None can doubt the existence and importance of metaphysics but only a few are able to appreciate the necessity and the value of hypermetaphysics. This latter deals with the problems of the one and the many, the bounds of possible knowledge, the ultimate meaning of negation, and the like. The word ' Negations-akt' appears very frequently in the book, and, as was fully explained in the review of the first part, is used in a somewhat peculiar sense. That the book is interesting goes without saying. Consider what it promises. A deduction of the immortality of the soul; a proof of modified pessimism; a- refutation of naYf realism; a combination of Leibnizian- ism and Spinozism hight 'monopluralismus': the suggestion that the universe will probably attain a condition of complete equilibrium, that the death of the organism is thus infinitely probable, while, at the same time, it is possible that organisms shall arise which neither eat, nor grow, nor die: an acknowledgment of inspiration drawn from Lotze and Hegel coupled with a complete abjuration of Kant and all his works-what, metaphysically speaking, could be more exciting? Our excitement may abate somewhat when we learn that the author's rejection of Kant is due to his own belief in 'the absolute reality of direct experience, and the consequentiimpossibility of every kind of subjective idealism and illusion- ism'. His modified pessimism, again, is a very chastened doctrine in- deed. It is neither pessimism pur sang (which maintains that things are as bad as they could possibly be), nor even pejorism (which maintains that they are very bad indeed). Malismus, as Dr. Petronievics styles his theory, means only that the evil outweighs the good just a little, which is, being interpreted, that in the present state of affairs pain slightly out- weighs pleasure. There is another respect, also, in which the present work ought to delight the soul of the metaphysician. We are invited to consider, not conjecture only, but proof positive, and withal a double proof. The important doctrines of the book are proved both by reasoning which is 'analytical and empirical,' and by reasoning which is 'synthet- ical and deductive'. The author prefers the first method, but would not venture to publish unless he could carry conviction by the second method also. Both methods yield certainty and not merely probability'(which is the most that induction can do). It is impossible, in this place, to deal with the immense range of argu- ment whch the work contains. I shall content myself, therefore, by considering the reasoning of the fifth chapter which is, by the author's own admission, the most important in the first part, and illustrates the impor- tance of the ' analytisch-empirisch' method.</page><page sequence="20">422 NEW BOOKS. The theory of naif realism (as maintained by Avenarius, Mach and others) and the theory of immanent idealism (der absolute Bewusstseinsrealismns) fail because they are forced to admit directly or indirectly that there are selves in reality which have spatial relations while they cannot consistently account for this fact. To do so it is necessary to draw a distinction between the knower and the content of his consciousness. The knower must be an unconscious simple substance occupying position in space and his nature partakes of will since he is the productive cause of these contents of consciousness. This solves the problems of quantity and quality as formiog part of the structure of the world. These simple selves (die einfachen Einzeliche)must really be unextended points. An absolute, non- spatial, simple being is a contradiction, since simple means unextended, and the unextended, being the direct contrary of the extended, can only be a point. Is it really necessary to go farther? The ' analytisch-empilrisch method is demonstration, I suppose, because it gives the only possible analysis of the facts. But surely if the facts be that there are selves, which are dis- tinct from the objects (or contents) of consciousness and also have certain necessary relations to space, there are many possible analyses. Selves must be unities, but why must they be simple? Why, again, must the knower be unconscious iust because he is not the known. Surely one possible analysis is that he is directly conscious of the known. Selves again are unextended, but their relations to space might surely be stated in terms of relation to points or, for that matter, to parts of space without thereby implying that the selves were points of space. Nor do the author's previous or subsequent arguments shed light on the reasons for his arbitrary choice. The book contains a very large number of misprints. J. IJAIRD. Platons (/astmahl. 3te Auflage.

The elaborate Introduction with which Dr. Misch enriched his recent edition of Lotze's Logik enables him similarly to dispense with all prolego- mena to the reprint of the Metaphysik, which is enriched by the addition of Lotze's posthumously published essay on the Principles of Ethics and by an admirable index. The reprint of Herbart's Einleitung in die Philo- sophie should do great service in calling the attention of the younger students among us to the solid merit of a thinker who, in this country at least, has never been so widely studied, except by the professional "pedagogues," as he deserves to be. Even for those who may reject the fundamental propositions of Herbart's own system, the Binleitung must remain one of the most luminous and suggestive of all " fir'st books " in Philosophy. The present edition contains a very useful further " in- troduction" by the editor to the Herbartian system in general. The reprint of Kant's Anthropologie has profited by the generosity of Prof. Kulpe, who edited the work for the Berlin Academy's Kant, and conse- quently contains much valuable matter which has never been made ac- cessible before except to possessors of that monumental work. Students of Plato will welcome the versions of the Philebus and Symposium. No one has a better right to be heard on the many difficulties of the former dialogue than Dr. Apelt, and it is pure gain that he has seen fit to add to his version an Appendixc dealing with the knottiest problems of exegesis. His textual alterations, however, mostly fail to commend themselves to my own judgment, and I observe that he has actually passed over the worst puzzle of the whole text (that connected with 714v acl&amp;ov i1pfcr-Oat (sic B, Etpi1o-Oat qadov I)) without a word. Of the version of the Symposium it may be enough to say that the translation is, as it should be, fougueux, and the Introduction excellent as a study of- Hellenic "erotic " temperament, though the translator is, I think, certainly wrong in his curious theory that Plato intends anywhere in the dialogue to glorify himself as the Messias at the expense of his "precursor" Soc- rates.

Three essays of which the first consists of an analysis of Memorabilia, Book I., the second is a version, with interspersed comments, of Aristotle, Physics B, and the third deals with Euripides' conception of the world and the Grundgefuhl of later Hellenism and their significance for our- selves. I cannot myself find anything " new " in Prof. Baumann's essays, unless it is his curious view that the common-places of Xenophon's So- crates form the basis of-a model philosophy which retains its permanent value for ourselves and, apparently, for all time to come. The transla- tion of Physics B will no doubt be found useful by students who are beginning to approach the Aristotelian doctrine of the " Four Causes " for the first time, but the exegetical comments contain nothing which does not seem to me familiar enough. The third essay, which might have been made the most inteffesting of the group, results in little more than establishing the far from - "new" result, that Euripides and the writers of later Hellenism generally combine a not very well defined</page><page sequence="22">424 NEW BOOKS. belief in God and God's judgments with a recognition that the course of human affairs often turns out unexpectedly; it is therefore well not to reckon too much on permanent prosperity; one should trust in God, but not forget to keep one's powder dry, and should remember that even if God and the powder-flask both fail one, it is always possible to face destiny courageously. Naturally Prof. Baumann finds it easy to produce numerous illustrations of so widespread a theory of life from all sorts of modern sources, ranging from the hymns of Gerhard to the love-letters of Bismarck and the works of Oscax Wilde. As he admits that parallels are equally common in earlier Greek literature from Homer on, it is not easy to understand why he should regard this conviction that "God moves in a mysterious way " as specially characteristic of Euripides and later Hellenism. I note that he is muich too ready to draw inferences about the poet's beliefs from fragments of lost dramas, where the views expounded may be, for all we know, as far removed from those of the author, as they are dramatically apposite. E.g., one has no more right to infer anything about the moral beliefs of Euripides from the casuistry of his Macareus than one would have to deduce a theory of Shakespeare's personal convictions from the utterances of Hamlet. If Hamlet had only been known to us by citation in Anthologies we should certainly have possessed the monologue on suicide, and might have been tempted to draw the inference from its silences that Shakespeare rejected the current theological view of the act as an offence against God. Possess- ing, as we do, the whole play, we know that it puts the theological view into the mouth of Hamlet himself as a plain statement of acknow- ledged fact ("or that the Everlasting had not fixed His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! "). For so small a work the book is wonderfully full of misprints both in Greek and in German. A. E. TAYLOR. Wilhelm von Humboldt und Die Reform des Bildungswesens. By Dr. EDUARD SPRANGER. Berlin: Reuther &amp; Reichard. Pp. 256. THIS is the fourth volume of the series of " Die Grossen Erzieher," and its subject introduces us to one of the most interesting periods of modern educational, and political history-the Renaissance of Germany at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Of this revival of German great- ness through education Fichte was the prophet and apostle, Wilhelm von Humboldt the organising genius. The introductory pages provide a background by sketching the condi- tion and the currents of education in the eighteenuh century and the opening of bhe nineteenth century. There are four main sections of the book. The first deals with the life and personality of Humboldt, and with his theory of education and Neo- Humanism. The second traces the steps in the organisation of the national control of education. The third sets forth the marvellous progress of reform in different grades of schools from the elementary school to the University-and naturally devotes special attention to the Gymnasia which now entered upon the long career which has made them famous. The fourth section shows the later development of the influence and tendencies of Humboldt, and enables us to realise how his genius is still affecting the evolution of German education. The volume is worthy of the attention not only of the student of peda- gogy, but of all who believe that 6ducation " exalteth a nation ".

A work of such historical importance and so well known to all English- speaking students as Lotze's Logik could not, of course, be criticised in these pages, on its reissue, without impertinence. It will be enough to call the attention of our readers to the mere fact that an excellent edition of it can now be had in the Philosophische Bibliothek for the niodest price of 7 50 marks and that we are promised a companion volume to con- tain the Metaphysik. The present volume i-s enriched by a long and learned Introduction from the pen of Dr. Misch, dealing with the various stages in the development of Lotze's thought, and by a German version of the very interesting essay by Lotze in the Contemporary Review (1880), on " Philosophy in the Last Forty Years," which, on one side, is of some his- torical importance as heralding the revolt against that " Intellectualism " which Lotze was himself only prepared to defend with considerable con- cessions. The publishers have also added to the value of the reprint by including as frontispiece an admirable portrait of the philosopher, taken from an original of the year 1870. It greatly facilitates the use of the work that the pagination of Lotze's own second edition of 1880 has been carefully preserved..

It is not customary for the recipient to look a gift-horse in the mouth; and that a disinterested third person should offer to do so for the benefit of those concerned might be taken ill by one and all. It must suffice, then, to take stock of the very varied contents of this highly tasty and nutritious writers' pie. Seven of the essays are in English, six in Swedish, and one in German. "Public Opinion," by Th. Rein, deals with recent manifestations of the vox populi in Germany. "The Houses of New Guinea," by A. C. Haddon, provides copious notes on the various, types of dwelling to be met with in a region where migrations and the consequent transmissions of cultural elements constitute a lead- ing problem. "Wanderings of the Dead in the Folk-lore of the Kiwai- speaking Papuans," by Gunnar Landtrnan, presents some of the recent gleanings of a first-hand student of savages. " The Economic Aspect of the Intichiuma Ceremonies," by B. Malinowski, traverses Dr. Frazer's view that totemism has contributed little or nothing to the econornii progress of mankind. "The Disappearance of Useful Arts," by W. H. R. Rivers, demonstrates the possibility of advantages in the struggle for existence, such as are provided by the use of the bow, of the canoe, or of the potter's art, being as it were deliberately thrown away owing to superstition or other causes. "The Clan as a Local Unit in So- ciety," by Rud. Elander, shows that kinship organisation need not be at cross purposes with the principle of locality as a group-forming factor. "Some Superstitious Customs in Primitive Warfare," by R. Holsti, argues that primitive war brings about in most cases the survival of those who take magic most seriously. " The Conception of the Causal Relation in Sociological Science, " by G. C. Wheeler, seeks to prove that a sort of causality may serve as a methodological postulate in the science of history, though it be not precisely the causality of the physicist. This essay, in particular, is one likely to interest the pure philosopher. " On Some Kinds of Duel in the North," by Thure Svedlin, brings the duel- ling of the Sagas into line with other primitive forms of the same institution. " The Place of Anthropo-geographic Synthesis in Sociology and the Philosophy of History," by K. R. Brotherus, exhibits the limits within which the influence of the material environment may be invoked in sociological explanation. "Bernard Mandeville's Theory of Society," by Ola Castren, gives an account of the views of the author of the theory " that the moment Evil ceases, the Society must be spoiled ". " Plata on Woman's Rights" (if this be a fair rendering of Platons Kvinnopoli- tik), by Rolf Lagerborg, embodies a review and appreciation of the famous theories of The Republic.

Torino: Bocca* 1912. Pp. xv, 365. Price, L. 5.00. Signor Troilo has published many papers and several volunmes on the history of philosophy from the point of view of positivism; the present work seeks to justify his conception of positivism as not only the necessary attitude of science, but also the only philosophy which does full justice to the claims of the spirit. It is in two parts, with three chapters in each.</page><page sequence="25">NEW BOOKS. 427 Part I. shows that both monism and dualism are essential phases of philosophy, neither of which by itself gives a satisfactory account of the universe. Monism is necessary from the point of view of Being, dualism from that of Thought or Knowledge. In the first chapter, making good this argument, there is a criticism of various modern idealisms, from that of Berkeley to those of Hegel, Schuppe, and Bergson, the general con- clusion being that from every point of view and for every system the monistic point of view is unrealisable, and is in fact abandoned. Unity is the law of Being, duality that of the Spirit (p. 86). The second chapter discusses the transition, both in the individual life and in the 'history of philosophy, from the primitive objective attitude of the mind to the secondary, subjective attitude, with an analysis and criticism of the views of Baldwin, Avenarius and Wundt; while in the third it is argued that this transition, though it has meant an enormous enrichment and de- velopment of the spirit, does not imply that the later idealistic attitude should have any preference over the earlier positivist one (pp. 154-155). The development has been possible, or has been fruitful, only so far as the two tendencies have been kept in close touch with one another. The second part is " the philosophical justification of Positivism," with chapters on matter and form in positivism, positive methodology and theory of knowledge, and the rights and values of the spirit. Science is a kind of implicit philosophy, the most concise expression of its stand- point and outcome being the Renaissance formula, Natura sive Deus. It is true that the recent movements in science tend to the subjective view of the laws of Nature, i.e., that they are either merely subjective interpretations of man, or at best, instruments by which the manifold of nature may be classifled and conveniently dealt with. To this Troilo would add that we are able to create and to use these laws only so far as we ourselves, as subjective beings, as spirits, are the product of a continued adaptation to and contact with nature, i.e., only because there is a correla- tion, an underlying harmony between the two terms. It is a repetition, in the relation of consciousness to Nature, of the harmony already found in the psychological and logical spheres, between the subjective and objective aspects. " Thus, underlying the subjectivity of our concepts, our schemes, our formulse, our laws, there is a sort of nucleus, a root, of primary, essential and irreducible objectivity " (p. 266). This is, in brief, Troilo's philosophical justification of positivism. He rejects, entirely, however, the doctrine of relativity on which Spencer laid so great stress, and in fact attributes to it the subsequent victory of the idealist stand- point, especially in the theory of knowledge. The new positivism is based on the entire adequacy of thought to being, and it is only such a positivism which guarantees the full realisation of all the values of the spirit (p. 301). The development of this argument, however, is left for a subsequent work of the author, a " System of Neo-positivism ". The present work is ably written, from its critical and apologetic point of view. The sympathy of the writer with idealism is so great that all the harsher, and perhaps one should add, the stronger elements of the old positivism have been expelled, and the new positivism is difficult to dis- tinguish from idealism itself.

Under its somewhat fantastic title, The Exile of St. Augustine, this work is a defence of the idealism of Rosmini against the prevailing Neo- Scholasticism in present-day Catholic philosophy. It is a new and en-</page><page sequence="26">428 NEW BOOKS. larged edition of a volume published in 1899, and consisting mainly of a detailed criticism of a Belgian book by De Craene, on the " Snirituality of the Soul " (Louvain, 1897). Indeed, the greater part of its bulk con- sists of texts and quotations of considerable length both from ancient and from modern philosophers; and the author himself is by no means concise. The chief argument is that ideas, are not a product or creation of the human spirit, but a manifestation in us of the divine Intelligence and Will, which are the source alike of the existence and forms of Nature, and of the truth and certainty of human knowledge. St. Augustine, Male- branche and Rosmini are vigorously defended against Aristotle, Aquinas, and all the Neo-Thomists of to-day. Running through the whole work are the familiar ideas of Rosmini, not only in philosophy proper, but also in politics and in religion; the idea, for example, of a universal Church, which, while remaining Catholic, shall return to the purity of the Gospel teaching; a Church of the State, but with less priestcraft and ceremonial a nd greater liberty both of thought and of action. Some idea of the con- tents of the work may be gained from the titles of a few of the chapters, which, for some reason, the author calls Respiri: " The Thomist move- ment hostile to idealism, which it does not understand, and friendly to positivism;" "Idealism classified and defended from calumny;" "Sen- sation and Idea: Inadequacy of Taine's view; " "The Psycho-physics of Plato, of Malebranche, and of Rosmini " (three chapters); " Materialism of the Neo-scholastics." The eleventh and twelfth chapters are mainly reprints in French of a discussion with Count Domet de Vorges on the earlier edition of this work; and there are two appendices, reprints of two papers, in French and Italian respectively, on the theory of knowledge and on matter. Although the whole work is mercilessly diffuse, and curiously out of touch -with modern thought, it is an interesting document, representing a movement of which in England we have little experience.

In this volume the author has collected a series of essays bearing upon educational theory, and practical educational reform. The opening essay deals with the Science of Education and leads up to able discussions on the possibility of a distinction between philosophy of the spirit and peda- gogy, on the modes and limits of educative action on psychical develop- -ment, on social pedagogy and religious education. One essay dives a general outline of theoretical and practical reforms, and is followed by a series of papers specially devoted to the reform of the middle or secondary school. Among the subjects taken up in this series are Formal Culture, Classicism and the Cultural School, the reform of the programmes of the primary school both in relation to its own peculiar work, and in its relation to the middle school. The closing essay is an appreciation of the pedagogical achievements of Pasquale Villari. JOHN EDGAR. Pr olegomeni ad una Psicodinamica. Di C. Bivso.

Hitherto psychology has studied the soul or brain as a thing by itself, whereas in</page><page sequence="27">NEW BOOKS, 429 this world there is no such thing as solitude. The psychology of the future, to which this little book is intended to serve as Prolegomena, will rectify this mistake and will study the brain as a co-existent. It will investigate thoroughly the action of soul on other matter, whether cerebral or non-cerebral. In the meantime it is enough to point out that while most formns of this action, e.g. ' moral' influence, hypnotic influence, levitation, are to be explained as examples of 'contact at a distance,' this fact in no way distinguishes the human from the infra-human world. For ' contact at a distance' is a phenomenon of common occurrence in that, world too, witness the law of gravitation, molecular cohesion, geotropism, sensitive plants, metamorphic rocks, etc., etc. W.

THis volume serves a triple purpose: it gathers various essays- and notes together round a common theme, it is a biography of rather ill digested views and observations, and it serves as the occasion for a more or less explicit claim to priority. In the introductory pages, entitled "Anthropomorphic ,Esthetics," the reader is introduced to the common theme of the collected papers- "the central discovery of modern -esthetics "-" the projection of our inner experience into the forms which we see and realise ". With this discovery the names of Theodor Lipps and Karl Groos and their theories of ' Einfuhlung' and I Innere Nachahmung' are most closely associated. But in 1897 our authors published in the Contemporary Review an essay on " Beauty and Ugliness " and they draw the reader's attention to it by reprinting it here (pp. 156-239), showing the parts written by each of them, and adding, in notes dated 1911, indications of changes of bpinion and insight which have taken place since the previous date. They are much concerned to show that, in the original essay of 1897, " contem- poraneously with the speculations of Lipps and of Groos and in complete ignorance of both," they attempted " to carry the same ideas still further in the direction of psychophysical parallelism " (p. 25). A claim to priority is quite consistent with the generous recognition of the success and merits of other independent workers. Full of this spirit, Vernon Lee was glad to encounter and welcome Lipps's Raumaesthetik, inwhich, she-says, she "instantly recognised the clue to the whole sub- ject ". And she became forthwith an enthusiastic disciple of Lipps. But the master was strangely unsympathetic and failed to see the kin- ship of his ready allies. He denounced their false propbecy and poured out upon them the full vials of his scorn,-in the Archiv fiiu Systematische IPhilosophie, Band iv., 1900. "The cult of organic sensations has become a mania," he cried. " -It is impossible that I should in any sort know of the changes in my body, of muscle-tensions, so long as I contemplate a column and am sunk in the enjoyment of its beauty." " A genius like James may be pardoned for spinning out grotesque ideas at his ease once in a while; but it is time the endless spinning out of them were stopped." The effect of this criticism upon Vernon Lee and further notes and dis- cussions are to be found in the praper entitled " Esthetic Empathy and its Organic Accompaniments," translated from the French of the Revue</page><page sequence="28">430 NEW BOOKS. Philosophique, volume lxiv., -1907. This translation occupies pages 45 to 144 of the present book. The rest of the volume is filled with copious extracts from Lee's Gallery Diaries of the years 1901-1904 (pp; 41-350), under the heading "ABsthetic Responsiveness: its Variations and Accompaniments," and it ends with a 'Conclusion' of fifteen pages. Some idea of the incompatibility of the mind of 'T'heodor Lipps and that of these collaborators may be drawn from the following sentences, which express the insight they have gathered in the eleven or twelve interven- ing years: " Prof. Lipps's testy criticism on Beauty and Ugliness, to the effect that it is impossible to be aware of bodily sensations while absorbed in the joyful contemplation of a Doric column, therefore shrinks into mere evidence to an individual incapacity either for self-observation or for such complex impressions as associate in other folk's minds the visual image of the Parthenon columns with the smell of sunburnt herbs on the Acropolis and the tinkle and bleating of sheep that rise from the valley below " (p. 349). " Granted that this empathetically attributed move- ment and energy are, as Lipps long since pointed out, abstract, or as I [sc. V. Lee] have called it, residual of countless past experiences, there re- mains the question: Why should these ideas of movement, these abstrac- tions from innumerable memory-images of movement, be awakened in connexion with motionless shapes, and, what is more, awakened in a higher degree and in a very varied manner, by some shapes rather than others? In fact, must there not be in us some present movement, how- ever slight, to set going this chain of associations of movement," etc. ? (p. 354). " That this actually existing and suggestive movement is largely that of the eyes and of all the bodily parts instrumental in adjusting our sight or affected by such bodily adjustments, I feel more and more inclined to think." "The esthetic pleasantness and un- pleasantness of shapes," on the other hand, Lee believes to be "ex- plicable by the mental process of formal-dynamic empathy, by the interplay of forces suggested by those shapes, and by the pleasantness or unpleasantness of such inner dramas of abstract movement-and-energy- associations " (p. 355). In esthetic contemplation the impressions from the object, empathy and all it involves, actual and revived organic and other sensations of individually varying kinds, are undoubtedly present. But it is also true that in esthetic contemplation, we enjoy the cesthetic object; we do not know of, or enjoy, actual or revived or condensed organic sensations or the like. What is enjoyed must essentially constitute the aesthetic object. Experimental cesthetics undertakes the discovery and investiga- tion of all the experiences which enter into, or effect, the realisation of the vesthetic object and its enjoyment. Our authors admire, though they do n9t follow, this line of work; they prefer the task of wide, occasional, observation and of speculative theory. Lipps may not always have done justice to the claims of analytic, experimental work, but there can be no doubt that he appreciabed, as well as perhaps any one, the problem of the coherence of the esthetic object, the interdependence of all its parts, and the important functions exerted by the stimulative centre of the -estbetic object-the sensory data of impression. Surely our authors have failed to see this problem of coherence, its importance and its essential relation to the problem of empathy. Apart from this failure, the volume is so full of repetitions and of unnecessary and unprofitable talk that it can only have the value of a biographical document. HENRY J.

This work is an interpretation of experience from the activistic standpoint. It is therefore in line with a tendency which is fashionable in the ranks ,of present-day philosophers, and still more fashionable among the camp- followers. But Mr. Philip is more than a camp-follower. In 1887 and 1897 he published essays on the nature of matter and energy, in which he maintained that "the scientific concept of energy adequately explains the phenomena of nature, and that the inconsistent concept of material reality should be finally abandoned ". These conclusions are used in the present work as a basis for the interpretation of the choir of heaven and furniture ,of earth. The book falls naturally into four sections. After sketching his solu- tion of the problem of knowledge, the author reviews the history of meta- physical speculation, and indicates how his theory clears away the mists that hang about the peaks of metaphysics. He then briefly shows that his view is supported by physical science, and finally in a rapid survey explains what new light his doctrine will throw on various departments of knowledge. Mr. Philip starts with the constant mutation of the sensible world. It is not a world in which things are in constant change. It is itself con- stant change. In sensation we are aware not of that which changes but only and solely of the change. Matter is only a process of change and motion. In order to find the real and immutable it is therefore necessary to transcend the limits of the world of sense. Reality is " erected for us by an intellectual operation " (p. 10). This erection consists in the system of affirmative judgments actively made by the waking consciousness. Theoretically it is possible to doubt this reality. But practically we must act as if it were true. Thus on the one side we have the ' actual' world of sense. Beyond this phenomenal world the affirmative judgment postulates or erects Reaility, which consists solely in Power or Energy. Even from such a brief outline as this, it is evident to what lines of thougbt Mr. Philip is chiefly indebted for his eclectic doctrine. His theory does not escape the pitfalls into which every such view has a tendency to fall. In asserting the priority of activity to cognition, the author is involved in a common confusion, the confusion between uncon- scious power and conscious power. As unconscious power, activity may -be prior to cognition, but as conscious power it eo ipso involves cognition. In order to secure its priority, Mr. Philip drags in the notion of ' in- tuition '-the most slippery of all philosophical terms. Further, there is confusion in Mr. Philip's doctrine of the relation of my self and other selves to the fact of activity. Sometimes (e.g. pp. 26-27) the notion of my self and other selves is derived by inference from the data of sensible change, in which power is manifested. But, again (e.g. pp. 21-22) the postulate of power is erected as an inference from my own immediate awareness of activity. The Cartesian cogito ergo sum is replaced by ago ergo possum. Hence is derived the idea of power. On the former view my self and other selves are interrelated inferences from the fact of activity or energy. On the latter view the agency of other selves is postulated and inferred on the analogy of the activity of myself. Mr. Philip appears to be aware neither of this confusion nor of the fallacies of the ' analogical' view. It is difficult to see how the concept of power or energy effects the escape of the theory from a fatal dualism. Set up on one side a world of sense which is actual (but not real), and postulate on</page><page sequence="30">432 NEW BOOKS. the other a world of power which is real (but not actual ?), and even the concept of energy will fail to secure a real unity. In the survey of metaphysics which follows Mr. Philip's sketch of his position, he displays a far from reasoning knowledge of the history of philosophy. He starts so far back as Heraclitus, and takes uniformly peculiar views of the various links in the philosophical development. In general he gives no evidence for his statements. As an example of his methods we may refer to two points in his account of Plato. Plato, we are told, represented the real character of things by W&amp;a and the essence of knowledge by elos. For this view no evidence is adduced. Now any evidence that Plato did distinguish between elao and Laa tends rather to invalidate this view: i.e. If Plato did distinguish, el&amp;ov means the distinct. and definite kind, and 184a the notional form. But it is really impossible to draw any sharp line of demarcation. Again, Mr. Philip believes that Plato's failure to solve the problem of knowledge was due to the fact that he gave no place in his theory to the conception of Uvaptv. But this belief, though commonly held, is demonstrably false. The importance of the conception of va,utsv in Plato will be realised by anyone who cares to refer systematically to the passages in which the term occurs. After having displayed the adequacy of his own view as contrasted with the defects of previous philosophy, Mr. Philip proceeds to show that his theory is supported by modern science. The Real is an " active energetic kinesis " (p. 74). Everything in the world may be reduced to Energy and its manifestations. Reality is itself a constant process of transmuta- tion. To such a view the physico-chemical sciences are infinitely more friendly than they were twenty years ago. In particular, the discovery of radium as an element in which a process of transmutation is taking place bas suggested the possibility that the so-called ultimate elements of matter are all undergoing transmutation. But in so far as these sciences still maintain the independent existence of three ultimate forms of reality, matter, energy, and electricity, they certainly do not lend any support to Mr. Philip's theory. This scientific position may prove to be merely another instance of the dogmatism of modern science. But we may at least affirm that it does not seem probable that matter and electricity should be reduced to energy. This would mean that the Cosmos was to be reduced to one of its forms or elements. It is difficult to see how the ultimate unity of the universe should be found to be one of the elements within the universe. In the last section the author applies his general theory in various departments of knowledge. He ranges lightly over such wide and diverse fields as biology and esthetics, ethics and metrics, dynamics and sig- nifics, paedagogy and physiology, economics and geometry. With all respect for Mr. Philip's real synoptic ability, may we suggest that (in spite of Mr. Merz)'the days are past when Bacon took all knowledge for his province, and the Admirable Crichton challenged Paris to dispute de omni scibile?

In addition to the letters themselves, the volume contains a short preface, notices of Thoynard, Limborch and Clarke, and explanatory notes, which throw the necessary light upon the numerous references to persons and books. Its value is further enhanced by an index and bibliographies. Dr. de Boer's share of the work consists of the determination of the text of the letters to Lim- borch, the notes dealing with them and the account of the Remonstrant Theologian. For the remainder of the volume Prof. Ollion is responsible. Complete novelty cannot, indeed, be claimed for any of the three sets of letters now published. Of the letters to Limborch the more important were printed, with occasional omissions, among the ' Familiar Letters of Locke to Several of his Friends,' in 1708 ; while the letters to Thoynard and Clarke, preserved in the British Museum, have been drawn upon by Fox Bourne for biographical purposes. As now published in full the letters to Thoynard, which occupy more than half of the volume, serve to throw light on some sides of the intellectual life of Locke, and illus- trate the width and multifarious nature of his interests. The corre- spondence abounds in references to questions in all departments of the physical sciences, to the mechanical inventions of the day, to books of travel and to publications upon subjects which made a special appeal to Thoynard, such as chronology and biblical history. Among the subjects of common interest questions of a philosophical nature unfortunately found no place. Hence the correspondence fails to furnish us with infor- mation, either concerning Locke's reading in this direction, or concerning the development of his own thought upon the subjects dealt with in the Essay. Indeed, the chief result in this respect of the publication of the letters in full, is to show that the one important deduction drawn from them by Fox Bourne rests upon an obvious blunder. It was never possible to reconcile the statement that Locke regarded the Essay as ' completed' in 1679 with what we know of the progress of his thought at that date; with the clear evidence that large parts of it were written subsequently; with Locke's own account of the time at which it was ' brought into that order' in which it was given to the public ; or, with Lady Masham's more emphatic declaration that it was during his retire- ment in Holland from 1683 to 1689 that 'he had full leisure to prosecute his thoughts on the subject of Human Understanding; a work which in all probability he would never have finished had he continued in England'. Nevertheless the statement, given as a quotation from a letter by Locke, has been repeated by Fraser and others without question. The context, 'however, shows, as Prof. Ollion points out, that the book which was 'complete' in 1679 was not the Essay, but Locke's copy of some portion of Thoynard's Harnmony of the Gospels. As has been indicated already, the letters to Limborch here published are the completion of a correspondence already familiar. The most in- teresting new material consists of an argument for the unity of God drawn from his omnipresence as filling all space. The positions- implied are to be found in the Essay and elsewhere, but are nowhere else so fully or so emphatically stated. The letters to Clarke are almost entirely of a domestic character. In Them we see Locke acting as medical adviser on all questions affecting the bealth of the family, fighting his own brave battle with disease, and rarely failing to send his 'service' to little Betty Clarke, his child friend, always referred to as 'my wife'. Some slight erxors would appear to have been made in the deciphering of this set of letters. Apart from these the book has been produced with commendable care.

This book discusses, with great clearness and considerable charm of style, many of the subjects with which speculation is busy at the present time. The author agrees in the main with the views of M. H. Poincare and M. Bergson, but turns the edge of his weapon against M. Charles Lalo and M. Paulhan. " M. Charles Lalo prive, en effaet, l'oeuvre d'art de tout contenu psychologique.

By RICHARD MtLLER-FREIENFELS. In two vols. Leipzig, 1912. Students of %sthetics will welcome this attempt to give a systematic account of the psychological processes involved in easthetic enjoyment ajnd also in msthetic creation. The book is written in a style which is remarkably clear and easy for an English reader. The whole treatment shows a wide and sympathetic knowledge of the various arts and of the general history of art, and the author includes within his materials infor- mation gathered from experimental, ethnological and sociological sources. It is unfortunate, however, that he has not included in the first named some of the most recent important work done by American and English psychologists. The author asserts his general psychological standpoint to be represented broadly by such writers as James, Ebbinghaus and H6ffding, and we have usually found his discussions reasonable and sound from this point of view. The first volume includes a careful analysis of the various types of asthetic enjoyment and of its intellectual components, and of the part played by feeling and the emotions. A short book on artistic production follows. In the second volume various topics-music, poetry, painting, etc.-are dealt with in some detail. At the outset the author distinguishes the zesthetic, as that which has its end in itself, from the practical, in which we are concerned with some-</page><page sequence="33">NEW BOOKS. 435 thing beyond the mere activity itself, though he admits that the two are often mingled. Under the term ,Esthetic he would include Play, from which Art is distinguished in that this latter can be expressed and " fixed" in an objective form while that is not the case with Play. It would seem, however, that some forms of play are not distinguishable from, say, drama, by this criterion. One must surely introduce a refer- ence to the different mental attitudes. Herr Miiller-Freienfels shows good grounds for questioning whether the highest -esthetic enjoyment is experienced by those who are pre-emi- nently of -he reflective, analytic type. He doubts too the capacity for keen musical enjoyment of those who -find music full of " ideas," as represented, for example, in some descriptive programmes. Whilst maintaining that there is always pleasure in the true aesthetic experience the author fully admits the part played by intermingled pain in intensifying feeling. Only in the " successive " arts however, such as music and fiction, can the artist successfully introduce moments of almost unmixed pain for the sake of contrast. In the chapter upon music the author, in dealing with the origin and development of music, gives due weight to the influence of the ease or difficulty of production and of the structure of instruments in determining the evolution of music. But in dealing- with the origin of harmony he fails to consider Myers's suggestion as to the influence of the relations of successive notes. His observations upon the absence of specific effects of minor and major chords have been confirmed by some recent experi- ments of the reviewer, and in general the sections -on music seemn to provide a useful summary of this branch of cesthetics. The sections on colour would gain from some consideration of the work of E. Bullough in this country, while elsewhere the recent work of Prof. Lillien Martin and of Miss E. D. Puffer deserve fuller treatment. C. W. VALENTINE. Goethe. By GEORG SIMMEL. Leipzig: Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann. Pp. viii, 264. Philosophic interpretations of poetry are always largely matters of taste. Some people like them, and others do not, and it is to be feared that the former are usually themselves philosophers, and that they do not often appeal to lovers of poetry. At best the procedure is too suggestive of breaking a butterfly upon the wheel, and most of us do not like to see this any the better when the butterfly is big and beautiful. It seems radically utfair to make upon a poet the demands for consistency and system to which a philosopher naturally exposes himself, and profoundly unpsychological to press these demands without regard to the dates aud events of the poet's life. More especially does a philosophic contempla- tion sub specie ceternitatis seem inappropriate in the case of a poet like Goethe who lived an extraordinarily varied life, and almost openly flaunts the dependence of the feelings and opinions he expresses on his personal experiences. If such career is to be philosophised about at all, the most careful attention to dates and to the biographical background would seem to be demanded. In the whole of Prof. Simmel's book however there is hardly a date, and nowhere an exact reference, and hence it is quite im- possible to check his statements. If in addition it is noted that his -style is difficult and obscure, with paragraphs often extending over three or four pages, and his polemic agairnst unnamed views about Goethe obscurer still, while no hint is vouchsafed of the plan and purport of the book</page><page sequence="34">436 NEW BOOKS. beyond the statement of the preface that it asks 'What is the spiritual sense of Goethe's existence in general?' and the confession that an inter- pretation of Goethe must always also be a self-confession of his interpreter, it will not be hard to infer that the book is ' nicht Jeder mann's Sache'. F. C. S. SCHILLER. Scienza e Razionatismo. By FEDERIGO ENRIQUtES. Bologna: Nicola Zanichelli, 1912. Pp. xv, 302. Lire 5. This book contains the result of seven years' reflexion and criticism, and consists of articles whith have appeared in various Reviews,-notably Sciertia, of which periodical Prof. Enriques is one of the editors,-re- written and welded into an organic whole. The growing domain of influence of the scientific spirit-rationalism-has roused up an anti- scientific reaction originating from those whose interests are threatened or whose habits are disturbed. And yet it must be granted that the doubts from which this reaction started are not wholly unfounded in reason, since everybody can see the dangers to which an inadequate com- prehension of science and the narrow rationalism that accompanies it may give rise. But he who has once accepted the idea of the fundamental equality of men in the presence of reason, and has grasped, on the other hand, the irrevocableness in the extension of scientific ways of thinking, cannot bring himself to oppose vain obstacles to the progressive move- ment of our civilisation, but will try to help and direct it, and thereby bring about the advent of a wider rational view adapted to satisfy the needs of modern life. Such is the object of Prof. Enriques's book. The first Part is devoted to giving precision to and maintaining, against the claims of pragmatism, the value of science; and the artistic, moral, social, and political value of science is pointed out. The second Part is on Rationalism and Empiricism. The history of rationalism is traced from the Eleatic criticism of the Pythagorean doctrines, through the logic and metaphysics of the Eleatics, Plato's theory of ideas, the forms of Aristotle, and Galileo's conception of science, to the metaphysical rationalism of Descartes and Leibniz. Then the proofs of the existence of God with Anselm, Descartes, Spinoza, and. Hegel, their criticism by Kant, and the pragmatist value of the ontologi- cal proof are discussed, and a short section on judgments of existence in the recent critique of the principles of mathematics is added. The weak- ness in the position of those mathematicians, we read on page 76, who, like, G. Cantor, consider such conceptions as that of the " totality of enumer- able series " as given, is shown by the " paradoxes of the theory of aggre- gates," such as that of the concept of the class (S) of all those classes which are not members of themselves. " These paradoxes are sufficient to refute the admission of a logical existence based on the verbal definition of a totality of which the general term cannot be constructed inductively in thought." Then the use of the principle of sufficient reason in natural science and pure mathematics is shown; its position (p. 100) is not logi- cal but epistemological. -Finally, there is a discussion of the English empiricists, Kant's critique of knowledge, and the Kantian a priori and non-Euclidean geometry. Then a rational doctrine of the concept is founded, and the objections raised by the English empiricists against the process of mathematics dealt with; and, by the light of this doctrine, the critical problem concerning the possibility of a rational science receives a clear solution, which may be described as experimental rationalism.</page><page sequence="35">NEW BOOKS. 437 The third Part is concerned with the conflict between Rationalism and Historicism, the metaphysic of Hegel, and historical Rationalism and the theory of the social mind; the fourth Part deals with the theory of the State and the representative system; the fifth with philosophical par- ticularism and with positive philosophy and the classification of the sciences; and the sixth with science and religion and the problem of reality. Prof. Enriques rather frequently misspells names. in an irritating way: we read of "'Kirkhoff " on page 11, " Shopenhauer " in the index (although the name is correctly spelt on p. 82), "Russel" and "Zarmelo" on page 114, " Maimone " on page 159, and variations on du Bois-Reymond's name on pages 76, 113, 298. Further, Bacon seems hardly ancient' enough to be Italianised into "Bacone" (pp. 56, 251), even if "Duns Scoto " (p. 31) be passed. However, much may be forgiven to a man who does not fall into the traditional mistake of spelling Leibniz's name asri" Leibnitz "A However such mistakes or merits are, of course, of small importance; and we proceed to consider the doctrines of the book. It is impossible not to admire the broad and sane spirit of scientific. synthesis that pervades this book. But perhaps the perception of the great fundamental connexions of things necessitates a disregard of those details which seem so important to a specialist: Indeed, one must con- clude that Prof. Enriques himself, from what he says on page 25, re- cognises that, questions of utility or individual preference apart, there is no difference in value between truths. And, in the second Part, there appear to me, to be some loopholes for criticisms. On pages 4346 is given, apparently after P. Tannery,! the view that, in spite of their discovery of the incommensurability of the diagonal and side of a square, the Pythagoreans held an atomistic doctrine of space and time, which they considered to be protected from the profane by the above discovery, and Zeno's puzzles were directed against this atomistic doctrine. Prof. Enriques repeats the first two-the Dichotomy and the Achilles-of Zeno's four puzzles, and remarks that the reason why the evident objection that the series of spaces or times considered in these two arguments is a convergent geometrical progression falls to the ground is that we are to reflect that the Pythagorean hypothesis was that there is a least interval of time (for example), and that thus the sum of an infinity of instants must then always be infinitely great. If I am not mistaken, this account of things will be new to many, at least in England, besides being unsatisfactory. It has usually been supposed that the first three of Zeno's arguments were directed against infinite divisibility and the fourth against atomism.2 And it was against the'idea that Zeno denied motion because the moving object would have to pass through an infinity of positions that Aristotle directed his remark: "But the moving object does not count as it moves ". And, in comparatively modern times, the mathematician Leopold Kronecker was of the opinion that, "without the supposition of some discontinuity in the filling of space, no change of position in space-that is to say, motion-is thinkable". Kronecker, then, seems to have thought that Zeno's argument in the Achilles, for example, is valid if we suppose that space is infinitely divisible. That Kronecker denied the existence of irrational numbers is irrelevant in this case, for he knew that the " sum " of an infinite convergent geometrical pro-' I Pour- l'histoire de la science hellene, Paris, 1887. ' Cf. Russell, P_rinciples of Mlhthematics, Cambridge, 1903, pi 352.</page><page sequence="36">438 NEW BOOKS. gression with a rational base is rational. Many things seem to have escaped Kronecker's notice; but one simple fact-wbich would appear to contradict the thesis that the Achilles destroyed an atomism of space or time-he, of course, grasped: the "sum " of the terms, after a certain one, of the above convergent series ultimately, that is to say, as the term referred to is chosen later and later in the series, becomes less than any non-zero number, however small. Hence, all except a finite number of terms of the above series represent a total length less than one of the supposed atoms. Zeno, then, did not prove that there must be an infinity of atoms in a finite space. The treatment on pages 74-76 of existential judgments, culminating in the passage quoted above, ignores the distinction between Being and Existence. If there were an S (if S had Being), we could easily prove that it "I exists" . The puzzling thing is that the general term and the class S appears to be genuine things; and the attacks given by Prof. Enriques seem to miss the point. Every definition is verbal; it concerns symbolism only and serves as basis for nothing except the name. It is mere baptism, and not creation. No general term of a logical class is constructed inductively, and there is no reason for accepting only those defined by " mathematical induction ". To wha Paul du Bois-Reymond called "Iidealism," and which is, according to page 76, "realism " in the scholastic sense, is attributed, on page 114, the "'inextricable obscurities and contradictions" of such paradoxes as those of Burali-Forti and Russell, and such pseudo- demonstrations as that of Zermelo of the possibility of well-ordering the continuum. The epithets are now, fortunately, out of date ; and, though, of course, there may be a point of view from which the very different considerations of Burali-Forti and Zermelo result, no explanation is given of exactly what this point of view is. It is true, in a sense, that the paradoxes arise from the supposition of a "totality ". But that precision is needed results from the remark (p. 76) that the concept " Aleph-zero " I cannot be admitted. Page 110 would have been, it seems, a good place to point out that modern research into the logical principles of mathematics is, far more than non-Euclidean geometry, fatal to the Kantian thesis that our mathe- matical conceptions must be schematised in space or time. However it is probably true that accuracy on the points I have men- tioned would, as some people say, " displace the centre of gravity of the work ". PHILIP E. B. JOUItDAIMT. L'Infinito. By CosMo GUASTELLA. From vol. iii. of the "Annuario della Biblioteca Filosofica ". Palermo: Libreria Internazionale, Alberto Reber, 1912. Pp. 172. The object of this work is to show that the antinomies (in the Kantian sense) exist; in other words, that the actual infinite is impossible. The solution of the antinomies, says the author, will be, perhaps, the subject of another work (p. 3). The actual and the potential infinite are dis- tinguished, and the latter alone-a variable infinite-is logical (p. 5). 1 That this conception is " the totality of all enumerable series " is not that of Cantor. It is something like that of Russell.</page><page sequence="37">NEW BOOKS. 439 The "actual infinity" of the parts of a straight line is meaningless (pp. 9-10), the field of the potential infinite is the future (p. 8), and there is no totality with the potential infinite (p. 9). The idea of the actual infinite is that of a series which has no last term but in which beyond each term is given another (p. 16), and the author passes in review the various applications which the human mind has made of this idea to, e.g., the infinity of space, the infinite regress of causes, and the continuity of motion (pp. 17-22). The idea of actual infinity is a consequence of realism, and realism is a consequence of the laws of association of ideas (p. 22). The apparent cases of actual infinities are discussed singly (pp. 23-33); and a contradiction is discovered in that an infinite aggregate may have a one-one correspondence with a part of itself (p. 57). The author's layinag bare of the supposed contradiction in the actual infinite by the remark (p. 58) that such an infinite " is both equivalent and not equivalent to a proper part of itself," rests on a confusion between Can- torian " equivalence " (one-one correspondence) and equality (or identity). Of course, aided by this confusion, it is easy to prove that an actual infinite implies that a mile is a metre (p. 105). Against Bergson, who maintains that the discrete is an appearance, the author maintains (cf. pp. 121-123, 129) that reality is essentially discrete and continuity is only a metaphysical chimera. It appears that M. Bergson is in the unhappy position of disagreeing with both finitists and infinitists. Pages 133 to 172 are occupied with notes which contain fuller accounts of the views of some of the writers whom the author mentions in the body of the book, and others. It is relevant to mention that it has long been recognised that the idea of what is called, for the sake of analogy or picturesqueness, a " variable " finite' really assumes an actually infinite class of finite and not variable things. No number is variable: mathe- maticians, when they want to say something about any finite number (any member of the infinite class of finite numbers) speak, in this case as in some others, of a " variable finite number".
