PICKERILL Department of Geology, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton, New Brunswick, E3B 5A3, Canada PALAIOS, 2004, V. 19, p. 79-88 This study details occurrences of Teredolites ichnocoenoses from modern bay-margin settings in Willapa Bay, Wash- ington. In particular, the paper scrutinizes in situ log- grounds from two intertidal zones situated immediately seaward of low-lying, supratidal, forested marshlands that are fed by small streams. Vestiges of remnant marshes and streams are preserved on intertidal flats as in-situ roots, broken stumps, strewn logs, abundant organic detritus, and organic sandy mud. Xylic material and organic sedi- ment were deposited in the supratidal marshes: tide and wave processes truncated the swamps, exposing in situ tree- root networks and the lowermost supratidal sediments. Stream and swamp deposits overlie and incise older Pleis- tocene strata. Both units are overlain by discontinuous, modern intertidal deposits. The intertidally exposed stumps and logs support a di- verse community of animal and plant life. Boring organ- isms, encrusters, and refugium seekers are found on and within the xylic substrates. Some encrusting animals and all of the boring fauna produce traces that are comparable to ichnofossils reported by palichnologists. Wood-boring traces reported in this study are similar morphologically to the ichnogenera Caulostrepsis, Entobia, Meandropolydo- ra, Psilonichnus, Rogerella, Teredolites, Thalassinoides, and Trypanites. Most of these ichnogenera have not been re- ported from rock-record examples of the Teredolites ichno- facies. The stratigraphic and environmental significance of the reported (modern) locales is consistent with previous stud- ies that associate Teredolites ichnofacies with base-level rise in marginal-marine environments. At Willapa Bay, bored xylic media form a coeval surface with adjacent, bur- rowed firmgrounds as well as softgrounds. INTRODUCTION The Teredolites ichnofacies comprises borings that pen- etrate xylic substrates. The most common element of the ichnofacies is Teredolites longissimus, although typically, Teredolites clavatus Leymerie also is present. These ich- nofossils are normally considered to be indicators of mar- Copyright ? 2004, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology) ginal-marine or marine conditions (Bradshaw, 1980; Bromley et al., 1984; Urreta, 1987; Arua, 1991; Savrda, 1991; Mikulas, 1993; Savrda et al. 1993; Mikulas et al., 1995; Lavigne et al., 1998; Pirrie et al., 1998; Obata, 2000). Some researchers have linked Teredolites-bored wood- grounds to marine transgression (e.g., Panos and Skacel, 1966; Bromley et al., 1984; Savrda, 1991; Savrda et al., 1993). Two occurrences of in situ log-grounds at Willapa Bay, Washington, provide an ideal opportunity to assess the overall significance of the Teredolites ichnofacies. As de- tailed below, the in situ xylic media support diverse boring communities that thus far have not been accounted for in rock-record examples. Observations made at these loca- tions potentially can enhance our understanding of fossil occurrences of the Teredolites ichnofacies. STUDY AREA AND GEOLOGICAL CONTEXT Willapa Bay is a mesotidal estuary situated near the southwest corner of Washington, USA (Fig. 1). Outcrop- ping Pleistocene terraces, which have been the focus of in- tense scientific scrutiny, rim the bay on its east and north margins. The Pleistocene deposits represent ancient bay accumulations that reflect similar, but not identical, de- positional conditions. It is the similarity of the ancient strata to the modern bay sediments that has inspired much of the previous geological investigation (Clifton and Phillips, 1980; Smith, 1989; Gingras et al., 1999). Addi- tionally, Willapa Bay is reasonably well known because of its association with megathrust earthquake studies (At- water, 1987) and ecological studies pertaining to diatoms (Atwater and Hemphill-Haley, 1997), thalassinid shrimp, and various fisheries. Willapa Bay is considered to represent a relatively pris- tine west-coast embayment (Clifton and Phillips, 1980). However, anthropomorphic influences, including local log- ging since the late 1800s, a diverse and enduring oyster in- dustry, shrimp-bait harvesting, salmon and crab fishing, and bay invasion by exotic flora and fauna (i.e., Spartina (cord grass) and the Japanese littleneck clam, Tapes ja- ponica), have shaped the modern bay. Moreover, efforts to maintain the bay as a navigable waterway have led to re- peated dredging of active (inlet) tidal channels.

Goose Point and Pickernell Creek locations are easily accessed: Goose Point is accessed from Bay Center, while the Pickernell Creek location is best reached by walking (at low tide) from Pickernell Creek, on Highway 101, northwards along the outcrop. Rising tide inhibits exit from the Pickernell area approximately 3 hours before high water is reached. modern bay has maintained a state of sediment infilling. Although presently it is filling, the eastern and northern bay margins are clearly in a state of erosion. Bay widening is associated with wave- and tidal-ravinement processes that are disjointed from the initial lowstand and trans- gressive erosion that shaped the valley in which the bay now resides. Modern erosion is most evident on the east side of the bay near Goose Point and Pickernell Creek (Fig. 1). At these locations, Pleistocene strata form prominent bluffs that abruptly break slope into gently, bayward-dip- ping surfaces that coincide with the upper intertidal zone. The firm, ancient substrate extends tens of meters from the outcrop at Goose Point, and as much as 260 m at Pick- ernell Creek (Fig. 1). Locally, the eroded Pleistocene unit has a curiously stepped morphology that has been attri- buted to wave or tidal-creek erosion (Gingras et al., 2001), but may also be related to post-seismic subsidence (Gin- gras et al., 1999). The nature and form of these erosional surfaces are discussed in detail in Gingras et al. (2001). Modern creeks and swamp/wetlands occupy topograph- ic lows in the Pleistocene strata. Where the creeks and swamps meet the tidal flats, the wetlands generally have eroded back with the outcrop. Two excellent examples of this-an eroded swamp at Goose Point and an exhumed creek bed near Pickernell Creek (Figs. 1-3)-are present at Willapa Bay. At Goose Point, the truncated swamp is manifested by in situ stumps that are immersed during high tide and occupy an 80 x 100 m area. The logs are bored by a diverse marine fauna; the intensity of boring in- creases towards the bay. The occurrence of woodground at Pickernell Creek results from an eroded creek and marsh, the remains of which can be traced across the tidal flat for over 260 m. Trees, generally fir and cedar, once resided near the low-energy channel and are preserved as in situ stumps that follow a long meander of exhumed creek bed. As with the Goose Point locality, the Pickernell stumps provide a xylic substrate for marine organisms. This study concentrates on the ichnology and sedimentology of these two locations to generate perspectives on their applica- tions to the rock record. METHODS Key aspects of this study included: (1) observation and identification of borings in wood and burrows in soft- and firm-clastic sediment, (2) characterization of sediment dis- tribution, (3) documentation of the colonization patterns on the in situ tree stumps, and (4) mapping the distribu- tion of bored stumps. Borings in wood were observed, photographed, and doc- umented by sawing or breaking the wood and exposing the inner, bored portions. Several examples were cut by saw, photographed, and x-rayed. Wood x-ray slabs were cut to a thickness of 2.5 cm. X-ray exposures were 60MVp for 50 seconds at approximately 3.0 mA, using a Hewlett-Pack- ard Faxitron portable x-ray unit. Burrows in the sedimen- tary substrates were exposed by trenching, using box cores, and by x-raying slabbed sediment samples. Sedi- mentary slabs generally were 2 cm thick. X-ray parame- ters were approximately 75MVp for 110 seconds at about 2.9 mA.

Surveying of the areas was conducted with large tape measures, compass and pacing, and by a portable GPS system. OBSERVATIONS Distribution of Substrates The immediate study area consists of exhumed Pleisto- cene strata, discontinuously superposed by recent marsh and creek deposits and even younger tidal-flat sediments (Fig. 3). Thus, sediment parameters at the surface, such as cohesiveness, grain size, and organic content, are mark- edly heterogeneous. In the study areas, the tidal flats lie on, or comprise ex- humed Pleistocene strata. At both locales, the strata are interpreted to have accumulated between 100,000 and 200,000 years before present (Kvenvolden et al., 1979). The Pleistocene unit is eroded flat and dips at a low angle away from the upper intertidal edge. At this point, either the slope breaks upwards into steep bluffs that locally form the bay margin, or the intertidal flat grades into su- pratidal, marshy lowlands. The ancient sediment is very firm, indicating previous burial and dewatering (Gingras et al., 2000, 2001). Organic-rich, muddy, Recent sands locally overlie the firm Pleistocene strata. The organic deposit encompasses occurrences of in situ stumps, wood clasts, and logs. Wood fragments, seeds, fir cones, and flakes of terrestrial organ- ic debris are disseminated throughout the sediment. The contact between the firm and soft substrates is sharp and occurs on either side of the wood-rich deposit, suggesting the muddy sands have accumulated in an incised channel. This is particularly obvious at the Pickernell Creek loca- tion, where a channel meander can be traced for 260 m across the tidal flat. Marshy lowlands, fed by small creeks, back both localities. It is inferred that the organic sub- strate represents the remnants of the eroded marsh and creek that previously occupied the tidal flat, albeit in a su- pratidal location. Modern intertidal sediments are patchily distributed across both the firmground and the organic substrate. The thickness of this sediment is variable, up to 15 cm, and ranges texturally from muddy sand to sandy mud. The sediments become an even, overlying blanket that thick- ens significantly baywards. At Goose Point, the modern tidal-flat deposits exceed a meter in thickness approxi- mately 100 m from the bay margin. Pickernell Creek has a shallower grade adjacent to the outcrop; thus, sediment veneer does not exceed a meter in thickness until well past the 260 m mark from the pocket beach, where the eroded creek bed originates. Because there is a wide range of substrates presently available in the study areas, a variety of modern burrow- ing and boring behaviors are observed. In general, the trace assemblages are characteristic of particular sub- strates. The most important characteristics of wood- ground, firmground, and softground trace-making com- munities (ichnocoenoses) are outlined below.

Stumps and wood clasts primarily are found in firm, organic to sandy mud that overlies firmer Pleistocene substrates. Large, Y-shaped burrows of the mud shrimp, Upogebia pugettensis, are most abundant in the firm Pleistocene stratum at Goose Point. Locally, they penetrate the organic sediment and are undeterred by wood fragments. Psilonichnus-like borings, emplaced by Hemigrapsus oregonensis, also are present. Although these borings may reflect re-excavation of teredinid borings, their overall geometry is very similar to excavations made by the same animal in softer substrates. Xylic substrates host a diverse community of boring, encrusting, and squatting organisms. Borings of spionid polychaetes (Polydora sp.) are present as U-shaped to meandering borings near the surface of stumps and wood clasts. Locally, these smaller borings are cut by, or intersect larger teredinid borings. The most conspicuous organism in xylic substrates is Bankia setacia (Inset A). U-shaped burrows of polychaetes and isopods also penetrate xylic substrates (Inset B). nities (Figs. 2-4). Several encrusting organisms, including sponges (Halichondria panicea), mussels (Mytelus edulus), barnacles (Balanus glandula), small anemones (Halipla- nella luciae), oysters (Crassostrea gigas), and rock kelp (Fucuc dustichus), cover stumps, logs, and exposed roots. Encrusting animals are unevenly distributed about the stumps and root systems (Figs. 2B, C, 3). However, those organisms clearly prefer wood that is continuously ex- posed to standing water. In such instances, the surfaces of the wood substrates are completely covered by encrusting animals. Small anemones and sponges dominate these aqueous refugia. Boring activities in the woody substrates largely reflect the activities of three animals, namely shipworms (Bankia setacea), spionid polychaetes (Polydora probosci- dea =Boccardia proboscidea; henceforth Polydora), and boring isopods (Limnoria lignorum, also known as grib- bles). Shipworms emplace long, tubular, Teredolites-like borings in the wood that originate perpendicular to the wood surface and ultimately bend, becoming grain-paral- lel, and generally parallel to each other (Figs. 5, 6). Tere- dinid borings range between 3 and 16 mm in diameter, and are up to 28 cm in length. Tight turns are observed where available substrate is restricted (Fig. 5B, C). Inter- penetrations are rare. Boring activities can be so intense that up to 92% of the original xylic material is removed. Typically, a calcite tube surrounds the entire boring. Cal- cite linings are lacking in abandoned teredinid borings. The spionid, Polydora is the second most common borer in these woody substrates. Generally, it emplaces small- diameter (&lt; 2 mm), U-shaped tubes that have a decidedly Caulostrepsis-to Meandropolydora-like morphology. Poly- dora borings initiate perpendicular to the wood surface, and commonly veer parallel to the wood-grain where it is encountered. Notably, where Polydora boring densities are high, the borings develop into a complex antler-form</page><page sequence="5">MODERN PERSPECTIVES ON THE TEREDOLITES ICHNOFACIES 83 FIGURE 4-Conspicuous borings and encrusters from xylic substrates in the study areas.

(E) In slabbed samples, the wood grain-parallel nature of the teredinid borings is most obvious. Here, the borings radiate with wood grain. (Meandropolydora) (Figs. 4, 5B). As with teredinid bor- ings, ecospace utilization is locally very high, such that very little original substrate remains. Boring isopods (Limnoria lignorum) introduce 2-3 mm diameter tunnels into the woody substrate. The tunnels are long (up to 10 cm) and tend to be arranged en echelon. The borings loosely follow the grain of the wood either un- til another boring is encountered or until the tunnel re- turns to the wood-water or wood-air interface. The traces ultimately resemble Trypanites or Teredolites; however, the animal also constructs crude U-shaped forms that are better compared to broad Caulostrepsis. The overall form of these latter borings is not eurythmically proportioned as those induced by Polydora. It is also evident that the amphipod Corophium volutator Pallas squats in aban- doned Polydora borings. The isopod renovates the initial gracile structure by increasing its diameter and extending its length. Other borings observed more rarely in the wood sub- strates include Psilonichnus-like excavations of the inter- tidal crab, Hemigrapsus oregonensis, and large-diameter (24 mm), Thalassinoides-like borings emplaced by the</page><page sequence="6">84 GINGRAS ET AL.

These typically are associated with xylic substrates at the Goose Point locality. The sponge Halichondria panicea Pallas is rarely present. WVhere sponges have fastened to the wood, small Entobia-like traces are developed. Barnacles, al- though quite common, leave only shallow indentations that are not always discernible. These are most similar to the trace fossil Rogerella. Besides the array of encrusting and boring organisms occupying the woody substrates, a host of squatters and refugia seekers are present in the borings as well (Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5B). These include the Japanese littleneck clam (Tap- es japonica), mussels (Mytilus edulis), amphipods (Coro- phium volutator), polychaetes (Neries virens = Neanthes virens), ligiad isopods, Pacific whelks ( Urosalpinx sp.), and periwinkles (Nucella sp. and Littorina keenae). Based on the 68 logs and stumps described from both lo- cations, the distribution of boring, encrusting, and squat- ting organisms is variable.

Sponges are present only in the middle-intertidal zone, where standing water remains around the wood. Stumps present in the upper-intertidal portions of the exposure (submerged for 2-4 hours every flood tide) have lower maximum boring densities, but about the same quantity of encrusting organisms. Here, the teredinid bi- valve, Bankia is generally absent. Occurrences of Polydora and Corophium range between 0 and 40 individuals/100 cm2. However, unbored wood is most common. Anemones,</page><page sequence="7">MODERN PERSPECTIVES ON THE TEREDOLITES ICHNOFACIES 85 oysters, mussels, snails, and kelp holdfasts approach 4, 3, 5, 37, and 22 individuals/100 cm2, respectively. Firmground Ichnocoenose Three distinctive biological associations are recognized in the firmground substrates at Willapa Bay: the Polydo- ra, the Petricola, and the Upogebia associations. Each as- sociation exhibits a strong preference for substrate firm- ness, substrate texture, and bathymetric zonation. Animal responses to these substrate parameters are detailed in Gingras et al. (2001). Polydora and Petricola associations characterize the study area (Fig. 5C). Polydora-dominated assemblages primarily consist of small Diplocraterion-like traces, which are produced by the spionid worm Polydora, and Arenicol- ites-like traces emplaced by Corophium. The traces consist of 1 mm diameter, 3-4 mm wide U-shaped tubes that de- scend 1 to 6 cm below the surface of the firmground. Bur- row densities range locally between 0 and 128 individuals/ 100 cm2. Population densities plotted along the intertidal zone also show a sporadic distribution pattern. Intertidal data are somewhat variable, due to the sporadic presence of a veneer of tidal flat sediment that correlates to a reduc- tion of Polydora burrow density (Gingras et al., 2001). Along with Polydora, burrows of the amphipod Coro- phium volutator are common. These traces have Arenicol- ites- and Diplocraterion-like geometries (Fig. 5C), and are broader than the burrows generated by Polydora. Larger burrows of the crab Hemigrapsus oregonensis and the bi- valve Petricola pholadiformis, whose burrows are Psiloni- chnus- and Gastrochaenolites-like, respectively (Fig. 3), are rare. In contrast, Petricola-dominated assemblages comprise clavate burrows produced by the bivalve Petricola pholad- iformis (Fig. 3). These burrows normally measure 10 to 25 mm in diameter near the base, taper to approximately 10 mm at the aperture, and range between 5 and 14 cm in length. Burrow densities range from &lt;10 to 87 burrows/ mi2. This ichnocoenosis is observed more commonly in the lower to middle intertidal zone, and is inundated at least 4 hours per tidal cycle. Other trace fossils include rare, Thalassinoides-like burrows excavated by the mud shrimp Upogebiapugetten- sis. These traces have a Y-shaped architecture (Figs. 3, 5C). Burrow cross-sections are circular and their diame- ters vary between 9 and 21 mm. Depths of penetration are between 40 and 60 cm. Locally, these traces are observed to translate from firmground to softground, and then into xylic media, without any perturbation of the burrow mor- phology. Softground Ichnocoenose Generally, soft sediments host several tracemakers that do not burrow into the firmgrounds. In sediment veneers overlying the firmgrounds, notable burrowers include the worms Nereis, Saccoglossus, Heteromastus, Cirriformis, and Nephtys, and the amphipod Corophium. These ani- mals generate, respectively, Arenicolites-, Planolites-, Pa- laeophycus-, Gyrolithes-, Rosselia-, and Diplocraterion-like trace fossils. Most of these traces veer from and parallel the firmer substrate where they encounter the firm- ground. Soft, organic-rich substrates that contain the bored stumps and wood clasts host an entirely different ichno- coenosis. In these sediments, the redox discontinuities are at, or very near the sediment-water interface. Thus, ani- mals that live within the anaerobic media irrigate their burrows with open connections to the surface. The bur- rows themselves also are maintained as open structures. The burrowing community is sparse and sporadically dis- tributed. In general, it only includes the polychaete Neries, which persists in branching Palaeophycus-like burrows, and the threadworm, Heteromastus, which constructs small-diameter, incipient Skolithos, Trichichnus, and even small Gyrolithes. INTERPRETATIONS AND DISCUSSION Woodground Boring Assemblage Perhaps the most striking feature of these present-day woodground ichnocoenoses is the high diversity of boring and encrusting organisms comprising the faunal and flo- ral community. In contrast, most rock-record occurrences of woodgrounds display a low diversity of trace fossils (Bromley et al., 1984; Plint and Pickerill, 1985; Savrda et al., 1993; Mikulas et al., 1995; Pirrie et al., 1998). Al- though these low-diversity suites are dominated by the ichnofossil Teredolites longissimus, Bromley et al. (1984) presented an excellent example of a woodground dominat- ed by Teredolites clavatus. Woodground trace assemblages commonly are monospecific, however, size-class variations have been observed in some of the boring assemblages. For example, several Teredolites clavatus detailed by Bromley et al. (1984) appear to represent animals at dif- ferent stages of maturity. This is more evident with ex- amples figured in Savrda et al. (1993), where two sizes of Teredolites longissimus are present. This bimodal size dis- tribution is best attributed to successive colonization events or the presence of different species of boring ship- worms (see Singh and Sasekumar, 1996). Notably, the diversity of traces observed in this study has not yet been recognized in the rock record. Although Teredolites is the common boring observed in xylic sub- strates of our study areas (Figs. 2, 4, 5, 6), structures akin to Caulostrepsis (Fig. 5B), Meandropolydora (Fig. 5B), and Rogerella (Fig. 5B) also are observed, as are less-common Entobia (Fig. 4C, D) and Trypanites, and rare Psiloni- chnus and Thalassinoides (Fig. 5A). Considering the abun- dance of animals that squat in, encrust, or bore into the woody haven, it is apparent that in situ occurrences of the Teredolites ichnofacies can represent a great diversity of organisms living in small bioherms. This is certainly true of potential bivalve diversity. Singh and Sasekumar (1996), for instance, showed that destruction of (test) wood panels was primarily the work of several organisms, in- cluding Martesia striata (the wood-boring piddock) and the various shipworms Lyrodus pedicellatus, Bankia cam- panellata, Teredo furcifera, and Teredo bartschi. Nevertheless, fossilized examples of the Teredolites- bored woodgrounds that include Thalassinoides, Trypani- tes, Entobia, Rogerella, Psilonichnus, Caulostrepsis, and/or Meandropolydora, as well as Teredolites, are unknown to</page><page sequence="8">86 GINGRAS ETAL. us. It is likely that taphonomy has played a major role in biasing our understanding of the Teredolites ichnofacies. Smaller burrows and surficial markings, particularly bor- ings akin to Entobia, Rogerella, Caulostrepsis, and Mean- dropolydora, generally penetrate only up to 20 mm into xylic substrate. Because wood is susceptible to abrasion during hydraulic transport, it is hardly surprising that such less-penetrative borings are absent on wood clasts. Even in situ stumps are in a continual state of exfoliation, providing they are exposed to even mild current and wave energy. In most cases, woodgrounds represent relict as op- posed to well-preserved substrates (sensu Savrda et al., 1993). Thus, deep-penetrating borings are commonly all that remain of the boring community. Still, it should be ex- pected that more diverse Teredolites assemblages have been interred in the rock record. Moreover, closer inspec- tion of known occurrences of the Teredolites ichnofacies may reveal more similarities to the modern than has been realized previously. One must also consider differences in depositional environments: many studied fossil log- grounds are subtidal and may host a different suite of bor- ings. Because most examples of Teredolites assemblages in the fossil record reflect a preservational bias that favors penetrative borings, Teredolites commonly is listed as the only notable component of wood-boring assemblages (e.g., Bradshaw, 1980; Bromley et al., 1984; Plint and Pickerill, 1985; Urreta, 1987; Savrda, 1991; Mikulas, 1993; Savrda et al., 1993; Lavigne et al., 1998; Pirrie et al., 1998). Thalassinoides is also a rare but persistent component of the Teredolites ichnofacies. James Howard informally, and with good humor, referred to such occurrences as "coal worms" (George Pemberton, pers. comm., 2002). Thalas- sinoides in xylic substrates are common in the Miocene Pe- bas Formation of Amazonia (Gingras et al., 2002). In the Upper Cretaceous Blackhawk Formation of Utah, Kamola (1984) reported a channel-floor xylic substrate dominated by Thalassinoides preserved as exichnia. Although the surface is otherwise unbored, wood clasts interred in as- sociated sedimentary media reportedly were bored with Teredolites, and abundant trace fossils (Ophiomorpha, Pis- cichnus, Pholeus, Arenicolites, and Skolithos) were ob- served in surrounding sand and mud beds. Considering the evidence supporting the presence of a diverse biota, it is reasonable to suggest that the bored surface hosted a dynamic biome more like the Willapa Bay examples. Depositional and Stratigraphic Significance Erosion on the bay margin and back stepping of inter- tidal sediments indicates that the study area is undergo- ing transgression. This is congruent with Savrda's (1991) and Savrda et al.'s (1993) interpretation that bored wood clasts of the Paleocene Clayton Formation (Alabama) may have been concentrated following an influx of xylic clasts into a marginal-marine setting. However, that study fo- cused on wood clasts that suffered notably more transport and input energy than the largely in situ specimens scru- tinized herein. Savrda et al. (1993) also noted the presence of reworked Teredolites-a phenomenon not manifested in the study areas of Willapa Bay. The present study is more analogous to Bromley et al.'s (1984) report of a bivalve-bored xylic peatground from the Cretaceous Horseshoe Canyon Formation of southern Al- berta. There, Teredolites clavatus dominate a coalified peat horizon that is taken to represent colonization following tidal-creek incision into coastal-plain sediments. None of the reported observations suggests that a diverse animal community colonized the surface (the trace-fossil assem- blage is monospecific). However, dissolution of the boring infills reveals various plant seeds, fish teeth, foraminifers, wood fragments, and rare bone fragments, all of which in- dicate that the depositional environment was not sterile. Again, the taphonomic characteristics of individual ichno- taxa censor the interpretations derived from the bored me- dia. Another similar fossil example has been described from near Beloslav, in northeastern Bulgaria (Panos and Ska- cel, 1966). There, the petrified remains of an Eocene forest records similar encroachment of marginal-marine envi- ronments over coastal lowlands. In this case, transgres- sion of the Lutetian Sea exposed tree trunks to the boring activities of teredinid bivalves. As the above examples and this study imply, exposure to marginal-marine conditions and subsequent coloniza- tion of in situ tree trunks by marginal-marine to marine organisms require an increase of relative sea level. Thus, as previous researchers have suggested, the Teredolites ichnofacies is strongly associated with transgressive set- tings. Substrate-controlled ichnofacies commonly are used to enhance genetic stratigraphic models. Glossifungites-de- marcated discontinuities, for instance, have been demon- strated to have sequence stratigraphic significance (MacEachem et al., 1992; Pemberton and MacEachern, 1995). This understanding comes from the realization that exposure of widely distributed, firm-sediment substrates normally is the result of a local base-level change (Pember- ton and Frey, 1985). Furthermore, the process of sediment dewatering due to compaction has been shown to repre- sent century- to millennia-scale temporal significance (Pemberton and Frey, 1985; Gingras et al., 2000). Because marginal-marine organisms typically thrive under in- creasingly marine conditions, the Glossifungites ichnofa- cies, like the Teredolites ichnofacies, develops preferential- ly in transgressive settings. Gingras et al. (2001) discuss the genetic and biological significance of Glossifungites-demarcated discontinuities. Therein, they failed to address the possible link between Glossifungites and Teredolites ichnofacies: namely, that discontinuities may be demarcated by discontinuous and sporadically distributed firmground and woodground as- semblages (Fig. 3). This study demonstrates that trans- gressive surfaces may be demarcated not only by the Ter- edolites and Glossifungites ichnofacies, but also by coeval softground assemblages (Fig. 3). Thus, a single disconti- nuity may translate from softground- to firmground- to woodground-associated ichnofacies. This conceptualiza- tion is especially disconcerting if one considers the diffi- culties inherent to subsurface correlation with a limited core database. Taxonomic Considerations In this study, the reported biogenic structures generally are borings in that the borings cut wood grains (cells). Sev- eral of the incipient ichnotaxa described in this study pre-</page><page sequence="9">MODERN PERSPECTIVES ON THE TEREDOLITES ICHNOFACIES 87 viously have not been reported from xylic substrates, and given ichnotaxonomic nomenclatural dilemmas and/or taphonomic considerations (e.g., MacNaughton and Pick- erill, 2003), perhaps understandably so. The ichnogenera Trypanites, Entobia, Rogerella, Caulostrepsis, and Mean- dropolydora are normally assigned to borings in hard shelly substrates or hardgrounds. Thus, their assignment to borings in a xylic substrate is dubious by convention. Thalassinoides and Psilonichnus, which originally were described from softgrounds and firmgrounds, represent burrowing activities, not boring behaviors. Thus, the tax- onomic affinity of those dwelling structures is likewise un- clear. It has been shown that organisms are capable of trans- posing ethology from substrate to substrate. Polydora sp., which is ascribed above to Caulostrepsis and Meandropo- lydora-like borings, make almost identical borings in shell, wood, and firmground (Sato-Okoshi and Okoshi, 2000). Likewise, although certain species of Polydora only colo- nize specific substrates, the borings are very similar from species to species. The dilemma of classifying morphologically similar bio- genic structures that occur in markedly dissimilar sub- strates has previously posed similar ichnotaxonomic diffi- culties. Bromley et al. (1984) upheld Leymerie's (1842) dis- tinction between the two ichnogenera for club-shaped bor- ings: Teredolites clavatus in woody substrates and Gastrochaenolites in lithic substrates. Further complicat- ing the issue, Teredolites longissimus clearly represents a distinct behavior that is not known in cemented sub- strates. Our observations in the modern suggest that Ter- edolites clavatus represents a behavior that is almost iden- tical to that represented by Gastrochaenolites. In contrast, Teredolites longissimus represents a different boring habit and merits its separate classification. More fundamentally, the distinction between Trypani- tes in hardgrounds versus Skolithos or Trichichnus in soft- grounds is not, strictly speaking, based entirely on the morphology of the different ichnogenera. Rather, there has been a preference to employ the trace fossil-encom- passing substrate as a taxonomic character of the trace fossil itself. In the context of xylic versus cemented sub- strates, it is not clear that differentiation warrants assign- ing a unique ichnotaxon to borings that occur in wood. Be- cause ichnological classification is used primarily to com- municate morphological information of a trace fossil, in- ferred behavioral characteristics are not required and are potentially incorrect. Moreover, because it is uncertain ex- actly how boring in xylic substrates differs from similar behaviors in cemented substrates, taxonomic discrimina- tion may be futile. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION This study has presented field-based observations from modern bay-margin settings in Willapa Bay, Washington. In particular, it has focused on the development of in situ log-grounds from two intertidal areas that are situated seaward of low-lying marshes dissected by small streams. The vestigial swamps and streams remain imprinted upon the intertidal zone as in situ root networks, broken stumps, strewn logs, and abundant organic detritus that are preserved in organic-rich, sandy muds. The organic sediment represents detrital material that accumulated in the swamps before it was transgressed and truncated by tide and wave processes. The low portions of the swamps superpose, and lie adjacent to, older Pleistocene strata, which now form a cohesive intertidal firmground. Scrutiny of the in situ root networks and stumps and their associated sediments reveals that the stumps and logs maintain the highest diversity of animal and plant life. Several boring organisms, squatters, and encrusters enjoy the refugia that the xylic material provides. Al- though animal squatters do not necessarily leave any evi- dence of their stay in the bioherm, some encrusters, and all of the boring fauna indelibly alter the substrate in that incipient trace fossils are carved into the wood. The traces reported in this study include: Teredolites, Thalassinoides, Trypanites, Entobia, Rogerella, Psilonichnus, Caulostrep- sis, and Meandropolydora. Most of these ichnogenera have not been reported as wood borings, indicating that either they are commonly overlooked or taphonomic bias within wood substrates is extreme. Most importantly, the obser- vations reported in this study suggest that similar ichno- fossil assemblages might exist in the rock record. Notably, the occurrence of a diverse boring community within xylic substrates generates potential taxonomic dif- ficulties. It is suggested that xylic versus cemented or firm substrates should, in general, not be given taxonomic con- sideration, despite the fact that both the Teredolites and Trypanites/Glossifungites ichnofacies are firmly en- trenched in the literature. The stratigraphic implications of this Willapa Bay ichn- ocoenosis are consistent with previous studies that sug- gest the Teredolites ichnofacies and/or isolated bored log- grounds typically are associated with relative sea-level rise. This is particularly true if it can be shown that the log- or stump-ground is more or less in situ. Notably, the xylic media forms a coeval substrate with adjacent soft- grounds and firmgrounds, all of which maintain distinc- tive trace-making communities. This study thereby un- derscores the potential complexity of bay-margin diastems in the rock record and, consequently, their correlation.
