Helsinki. 1929. 189 pp. The study of contemporary English idealism and realism by Salomaa has been prompted by the feeling that little is known on the continent of Europe concerning the English philosophers since Spencer beyond their names. Modern European philosophy has developed along national lines, largely because of the use of the vernacular; and English philosophy has especially become subject to this process of isolation. Specific English traits which have in- fluenced their philosophies, idealistic no less than realistic, are said to be an emphasis on facts, an interest in practical problems, conservatism (e.g., in terminology), individualism, and religious Puritanism. Today there is a renewed concern with metaphysical problems and a growing disuse of empirical methods in favor of highly speculative tendencies, but the traditional epistemological interest has remained supreme, the main discussion centering around the category of relation. The scope of the study made by Salomaa and the methods em- ployed by him have admittedly necessitated a fragmentary treat- ment of his subject. Though limiting himself to contemporary English idealism and realism, the author tells us little concerning prominent representatives of even these two movements beyond their names. In his more extended accounts he gives us mainly brief doctrinal resumes, indications of similarities and differences with respect to related viewpoints, and criticisms from the stand- point of his own theory of relations, his sympathies being plainly on the side of the realists. After a brief account of the rise and development of the new idealism in England, Salomaa devotes his chief attention, among the idealists, to Bradley, Bosanquet, and McTaggart. Bradley is characterized as a dogmatic mystic motivated by ethical and re- ligious or esthetic rather than by theoretical considerations. The chief logical weakness of Bradley is found in his theory of judg- ment, according to which the subject of all judgments is the totality</page><page sequence="2">696 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of reality; Bradley 's assumption of self-contradictory "appear- ance" is declared to be as impossible as would be a self-contradic- tory "reality"; and the doctrine of reality as absolute experience is judged to be incomplete without the assumption of an absolute consciousness. The influence of Bradley on English thought and the interrelations between him and Bosanquet are aptly pointed out. Bosanquet has freed English idealism of the mysticism and paradoxes of Bradley and given it manifold detailed application. Bosanquet's basic doctrine of the totality of reality is rejected by Salomaa as shedding no light on the nature of reality; the inner harmony of the totality of knowledge is shown to be no guarantee of truth; and the doctrine of the concrete universal is found to be inapplicable to the concept of absolute reality as well as to other concepts. According to the idealistic theory of truth Mark Twain may be supposed to have expressed profound philosophic insight when he declared reports of his death to have been grossly exag- gerated! After a hurried treatment of personal idealism, the pluralistic idealism of McTaggart is discussed, despite its lack of epistemological interest and despite the difficulties for brief sum- marization involved in its uniqueness. McTaggart is acknowledged to be a clear and cogent thinker, but such doctrines as the identi- fication of reality and existence are subjected to criticism, and his attempt to revive the obsolete a priori method is characterized as isolated and unsuccessful. An interesting account is given of the new realism, the assump- tions of which are contrasted with those of pragmatism, idealism, and Scottish realism. Pragmatism is viewed by the author as a shortlived "fad," the "anthropomorphism" in which is even more objectionable to him than that of idealism. In the question of the existence of consciousness asserted by most of the English realists over against the American neo-realists, who maintain the relational theory of consciousness, Salomaa favors the English interpreta- tion, although he credits the American theory with accentuating more clearly the differences between idealism and realism. One of the best sections of the book is the illuminating discussion of the new logistics, the significance of which the author considers to be exaggerated by the realists. Realism may be defended inde- pendently of the mathematical logic, which is, moreover, not as purely deductive as it is claimed to be and which fails to deal ade- quately with non-mathematical processes of thought. Of the realists, Salomaa singles out for special treatment Moore, Russell, and Alexander. Moore is described as a rationalistic real- ist, with an undeveloped metaphysical system which may be inter- preted as being either idealistic or realistic. Moore's significance is seen in his endeavor to clarify the issues; his Refutation of Ideal-</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 697 ism is termed inadequate in that it has, despite its empirical as- sumptions, retained the idealistic method; and such doctrines as the hypothetical nature of physical existence are found to be far removed from "common sense," as is the entire realistic stand- point of Moore, which is judged to be closer to Platonic "ideal- ism" and scholastic realism. Against Moore's theory of conscious- ness as a pure act, Salomaa maintains that consciousness is also a state, the subjective factor in consciousness having to be stressed, in view of the problem of error, against Moore's doctrine of the infallibility of the senses. The philosophy of Russell is com- mended, although frequent changes have been made in it, for its endeavor after scientific objectivity; but his theory of reality is condemned as too solipsistic, his conception of causality as too behavioristic, and his "neutral monism" as a "neutral mentalism" far removed from a realistic point of view. In his metaphysics Russell has neglected the irrational aspects of reality, and in his philosophy of life he has been too emotional, especially in his later works. The distinction made by Alexander, according to which consciousness "enjoys " itself, but "contemplates" its objects, leads away from experience, according to Salomaa, there being no essential difference between the function of enjoyment and that of contemplation, but only between their objects. Alexander's space-time is no more empirical than Bradley's absolute, and his theory of emergence is a mere "fad" leading to an optimism not justified by experience, which seems to teach the difficulty of the preservation of higher qualities. The place of space-time at the lowest step in the emergence of new qualities is arbitrarily as- sumed by Alexander, according to Salomaa, since the various aspects of reality may be better revealed at the higher than at the lower stages of evolution. On the whole, Salomaa finds both idealism and realism in con- temporary English philosophy inconsistent and not sufficiently empirical. Idealism suffers from the subjective elements remain- ing in it, despite its professed objective basis, and thus fails to ac- count for the existence of nature; while realism maintains the passivity of knowledge and thus fails to explain the occurrence of error. Idealism, moreover, denies all external, and realism all in- ternal, relations. The author is more favorably inclined to the views of the American critical realists and looks for a reconcilia- tion of the oppositions not in logic-which can not, e.g., do justice to the reality of time-but in the metaphysical problem of the na- ture of relations. Of these, some are innerlich, such as cause; others are iusserlich, such as similarity and dissimilarity. Unity is to be conceived, not absolutely, apart from relations, nor atomis- tically, as an aggregate, but as a Beziehungsganzheit, as a system</page><page sequence="4">698 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY of relations. The task of metaphysics, then, consists in an expli- cation of the nature of the relations holding reality together. His own metaphysical theory the author has presented in the study, The Category of Relation. Relation is found to be the " original category" containing "the essence common to all" the categories (p. 15). The history of philosophy and of scientific thought are sketched with a view to showing that the concept of relation has been fundamental in both, having in increasing meas- ure replaced the concept of substance (though not to the same ex- tent in the biological sciences as in the physical sciences). In epistemology such notions as concept, judgment, inference, etc., and in metaphysics such categories as being, space, time, quality, the whole, etc., are founded on relation, not excepting the concept of the absolute; for while we may be able to "live" the irrational constituents of reality, "metaphysical knowing can at most reach only as far as reality in its essentials is logical and contains rela- tions" (p. 137). As to the nature of relation, Salomaa rejects the "metaphys- ical" or "transcendent theory," which asserts the existence of something "beyond" or "underlying" the mutual relations be- tween two terms; the theory of "internal" relations, according to which related terms produce modifications in each other; and the theory of "external" relations, according to which relatedness and independence may co-subsist between the terms of the same rela- tions. Instead he proposes the "immanent theory of relations," according to which internal and external relations, while they can not be deduced from one another, nevertheless "have this in com- mon that they do not require any extraneous outside mediator, but relate-so to say-self-sufficiently, immanently" (p. 152). A list of important relations is given, all of which, it is empha- sized, are real in their respective connections. As the criterion of reality, "independence of the knowing subject" is suggested (p. 173). The significance of objects and that of subjects are under- estimated in idealism and neo-realism, respectively. The subject- object relation is interpreted as a functional relation, both terms in a function being related and yet independent of one another; and objects without subjects are said to be conceivable somewhat as extension without color is perceived by the sense of touch (pp. 169, 170). Relations, as subsisting, belong to the realm of essence. The system of relations and of the categories based on them, being derived from the order of reality, is continually changing. This view is offered by Salomaa as avoiding a one-sided rationalism and a one-sided irrationalism, and as leading, not to a relativism, but to a relationism asserting the reality of relational wholes in which</page><page sequence="5">JOURNALS AND NEW BOOKS 699 relations and their terms, the rational and the irrational, are in- dissolubly united.
