<plain_text><page sequence="1">81 On Large Gemstones1 In a previous issue of the ZPE I discussed AB 8, a valuable epigram from Posidippus' Lithika that has been transmitted through Pap.Mil.Vogl. VIII 309.2 I argued then that the epigram in question describes an exceptionally large cornelian cameo with a representation of Dareios III that is praised for its brilliance and rarity.3 Its discovery advanced in my opinion the deadlocked debate on the dating of the first production of such artefacts. This short essay will further argue on the basis of epigraphic evidence that cameos may have been produced on a limited scale more than a century before Poseidippos, become in vogue in the Hellenistic period, and that stimulus for their production may have came from the East. Dating cameos, most of which come from unknown contexts, is notoriously difficult, and stylistic analysis constitutes a subjective criterion for the determination of provenance and date. In his important study of cameos Plantzos reviewed the evidence, including the few surviving artefacts from secure archaeological contexts, and concluded that while the technique for cutting stones in relief pre-existed, cameos were probably first produced in the late Hellenistic period.4 In my discussion of AB 8 I argued that the state of the admittedly meagre evidence as pointed out by Plantzos did not exclude their manufacturing in the third century BC, and that Poseidippos's large cornelian of at least 22 cm. length and 66 cm. circumference could not have been an intaglio. Furthermore, evidence from the Classical and Hellenistic inventory lists from Delos suggests that while votives can be associated with cameos, the term totco? was used for both intaglios and small votive reliefs. The general ambiguity and vague ness in the language of the inventories notwithstanding, tijtco? could therefore also have referred to cameos.5 Even though gemstones flooded the Greek world following Alexander's campaign, they had already reached Greece much earlier by way of the luxury-good trade, but both their unavailability locally and presumed high prices prevented their diffusion. They are rarely attested in temple inventories of the Classical period and are mostly associated with jewellery and sealstones.6 There are exceptions of course, and the catalogue that follows lists occurrences of pieces of onyx in the inventory lists of the Athenian Acropolis, all dating to the first quarter of the fourth century BC:7 1 Professor Christian Habicht should be gratefully acknowledged for granting me access to squeezes of Athenian inventory lists at the collection of the Institute for Advanced Study during a visit to Princeton.

On page 36 I have inadvertently referred to the gemstone as "sardonyx" instead of "sardion" or "cornelian" for which overlook I am solely responsible. The context makes it obvious that I do not interpret the artefact in question as a sardonyx cameo. Sardonyx became the material for large cameos par excellence in the Hellenistic period and were particularly popular for the effects of the various colored strata within the gemstone that enhanced the contrast of images in relief. 4 D.

A few decades earlier Woodward had suggested an unlikely new reading for IG II2 1388, B, 1. 62-63 which led him to associate this entry with two items that presumably formed one dedication lot: a gold goat-stag protome weighing 32 drs. (ca. 135 gr.) and a large onyx.17 Protomai are mentioned in greater detail in inven tories from Didyma18 and are compatible with actual finds from Persian contexts, but in all known cases they are five or six times heavier than the presumed goat-stag head from the Athenian inventories.19 The large size of the onyx objects of Cat. 1, 2,4 (jn?ya?), assuming the latter two were also decorat ed, makes it a peculiar medium for incised representations that were usually associated with small-sized seals, most often cylinder-shaped or pyramidal.20 To begin with, Persian seals were often made of varieties of chalcedony,21 and their maximum dimension generally did not exceed 4 cm. which makes it impossible that they could weigh the recorded 32 drs. (ca. 135 gr) of Cat. 1. As a matter of fact, the weight of a surviving typical example from Rudbar whose height is just under 3 cm., amounts to about 3 gr.22 Last, but not least, sealstones, including those that were made of onyx, were usually specifically described as such in inventory lists even though details of their decoration were not often given.23 Based on these considerations, one may conclude that the use of the adjective |i?ya? in association with the onyx objects in Cat. 1, 3-4 corresponds to their actual large size, and they were therefore significantly larger than sealstones and beads and certainly remarkable given the fact that large gemstones of high quality, i.e. almost flawless, are rare in nature. Cat. 3 weighing 276 lli drs. (ca. 1,161 gr) would definitely qualify for a ^?yoc? onyx. Even though we do not know how these four pieces of onyx were cut, the reported weight of Cat. 1 and 3 allows us to draw some conclusions as to their actual size and dimensions. Cat. 1 represented a gemstone of about 675 carats and certainly not a bead, while the mysterious Cat. 3 was an even more impressive piece of about 5,805 carats.24 Both were probably either cut en cabochon or merely given a flat, polished surface on which, at least in the case of Cat. 1, a goat-stag was depicted.25 A comparison with actual gemstones can lead to very general conclusions as to the dimensions of Cat. 1 : it cannot have been used as jewellery but was rather "ornamental". While there are actual modern examples weighing 675 carats that were given a round shape and have a diameter of about 12 cm., the dimensions of such a piece are heavily dependent upon its form and thickness.

Kosmetatou therefore relatively thin, it would have had a much larger overall dimension, and conversely the opposite would have been true of a more "massive" carving. The thickness or detail of the carving would therefore heavily influence the length and width dimensions.26 At any rate, whatever the maximum dimension of Cat. 1 may have been, Cat. 3 was eight and a half times larger. It is impossible to determine what kind of artefacts Cat. 2-4 represent at the current state of the evidence, but, like Cat. 1, they were too large for jewellery applications: large gemstones simply polished or decorated that may have been dedicated to Athena as curiosities. Cat. 4 which is described as broken (Kaxeay ?), may have been flawed with inclusions or cracked. Cat. 1 was certainly decorated, but its size makes it unlikely to have been an intaglio seal. Evidence from the vocabulary of inventory lists from Athens and Delos makes it equally unlikely that this was an onyx figurine. Statues and figurines are usually clearly identified as such in inventories; anthropomorphic figurines are identified as ? i?ioc, arijie?a or ?v?piavxi?ia, while animal statuettes are referred to with the name of the animal, occasionally in the diminutive form.27 On the other hand, Cat. 1, which is contemporary with attested figurines mentioned in inventories, is defined first by its material (onyx) and then by its representation in genitive, a very unusual and otherwise unattested way of describing a statuette. Moreover, the Athenian inventories never provide the weights of figurines that were listed in them.28 The evidence suggests that the language of Cat. 1 is more consistent with descriptions of reliefs. Inscribed building accounts of the Erechtheion refer to the relief decoration of its frieze (?coupopo?) as 'EtauaiviocKO? ?,i9o? rcpo? h?i x? ?oia.29 Indeed, the temple was built in Pentelic marble with bluish Eleusinian limestone for the frieze, to which, as the relevant building account also informs us, figures -mainly female- in white marble were attached by clamps. What is more significant, Delian inventories whose vocabulary of figurines is identical to that of the slightly earlier Athenian lists, describe votive reliefs in exactly the same terms as Cat. 1 : first by their material followed by the subject of their representation in genitive. We hear thus that the Delian Artemision housed an ?pyupiov 'Acppo?iiri? EKTimov from as early as 367 to at least as late as 352 BC.30 One may wonder then whether Cat. 1 was not an early cameo, even though there is no evidence for their manufacture at so early a date. Nevertheless, the technique of cutting a relief on stone certainly existed, and while I know of no evidence for the production of cameos in the early fourth century BC, in the Achaemenid empire or the Greek world, the ongoing Greek-Persian acculturation process may have led some Greek artisans from Anatolia to make this easy leap forward and occasionally cut reliefs on larger semi-precious stones. Cameos, along with other oriental products, certainly became in vogue after Alexander's conquests when the market was flooded with gemstones and artefacts from the East. However, given the lack of concrete archaeological evidence and the great uncertainty regarding the date for the earliest production of cameos this suggestion is put forward tentatively.
