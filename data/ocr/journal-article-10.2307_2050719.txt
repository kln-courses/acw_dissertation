Rangoon, I960. vi, 546. Reprint of pre-World War II volume. It is a little difficult to be objective about this volume: that would be rather as if, having been invited to a reunion of old friends, one started to make loud comments on how pomp- ous one person has become, how shabby an- other, and how a third is really beginning to lose his grip. This is not to pretend that this reviewer can claim much more than an ac- quaintanceship with perhaps half the writers commemorated in these pages; but so much of one's professional life has been passed in the company of these papers, now gathered to- gether, that it is impossible to give them a completely fresh appraisal. As is appropriate, this book gives special consideration to the work of the men who founded the Burma Research Society in I9I0. The prime movers were J. S. Furnivall and J. A. Stewart, with G. H. Luce and Pe Maung Tin as powerful supporters. These four men were not only scholars in the sense that they themselves undertook original research, but they were also scholars who generated in those around them a similar enthusiasm and venera- tion for acquiring knowledge. They were in the noblest tradition of the Guru and the Dominus. The works of J. S. Furnivall are widely known (and, be it remembered, the B.R.S. is not his only memorial-he also encouraged the seminal Burma Book Club and the Burma Translation Society). It is curious that he is the least worthily represented in this volume. His real contribution to scholarship lay in providing the foundations of the economic history of Burma, and in this volume is one of his pre- liminary studies, "The Early Revenue History of Tenasserim." Although somewhat bulky, it is unfortunate that his later work on the same theme "The Fashioning of Leviathon: The Beginnings of British Rule in Burma" could not be included. This appeared in vol. XXIX of the lournal, and was not superseded by any of his later work. J. A. Stewart is less widely remembered. Be- fore joining the I.C.S. he gained the highest honours as a classical scholar. After long and most humane service in the administration (which included a wartime interlude in the Burma Sappers and Miners), he became Pro- fessor of Burmese in the University of London, and the architect of the Department of South East Asian Studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies. Probably his finest monu- ment is the great Burma Dictionary, which sets a philological standard unsurpassed outside of the Oxford English Dictionary. The pieces which are included here are slight, but they are not unworthy. In "Spinning Magic" he deploys his classical learning deftly, and with an easy touch; yet how much light is cast on folklore, literature, and anthropomorphism in these few agreeable yet austere pages. His translations, seemingly casual, are most carefully devised to reproduce not only the meaning but also the literary style of the original. The last little poem, "Roselle Buds," may (to modern eyes and ears) appear a little arch and sentimental, in the style of Georgian Poetry. But all this is re- deemed (at any rate, for this reviewer) by the feeling for Burma which shines through. The characteristic which linked almost all the con- tributors to this volume, in their disparate ways, was a clear-eyed love and understanding of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 409 Burma. It is all very different from the cal- culating, pseudo-scientific, and (so often) arid research of our present time. The most considerable contributor to this volume (as to the original Journal) is Gordon Luce: the selection of his writings here in- cluded makes up nearly half the total volume. It is no slur upon his peers to say that these articles by Luce make it imperative for every institution dealing (however superficially) with southeast Asia to obtain a copy of this book; it provides the means of acquiring some of the basic texts for Burmese studies. Time and again, scholars of repute return to these ar- ticles; they are, indeed, a mine of information; and for once the simile is apt, because one has to dig and dig again to bring forth their con- tents. Until the long-awaited hour when Luce's definitive Old Burma appears, his unique his- torical and linguistic knowledge can be gleaned only from these articles. 'Where there is so much richness, one does not pick and choose; but to this reviewer the two most rewarding papers are the "Economic Life of the Early Burma" and "Burma Down to the Fall of Pagan" (written with Pe Maung Tin). It is probably silly to cavil, but why did not the editors also include "Burma's Debt to Pagan" (vol. XXII)? This, also, is an essential tool of our trade. Luce makes no concessions in his learned articles; he expects his readers to work as hard as himself. However, embedded in the unyield- ing mass of ore lies one polished gem-his poem, "The Golden Chersonese," an evocation of classical Buddhist architecture. Impersonal, unseen, the fire Of life, whose tinder all things are, Mid smoking jungle lifts its spire, Where mind and matter writhe and jar. Again, we see that here is a man who has given to Burma not only his life, but also his love. If the other contributions do not form such a fundamental part of the scholarship of Burma, they are nonetheless worthy of this commemorative volume: J. L. Christian, D. G. E. Hall, U Kaung, are among those who tended the somewhat flickering flame of exact scholarship in the I920's and 30's. One last reflection: here, in this volume, is evidence that from I9IO to I940 there were men and women in Burma who cared enough about its past, its literature, and its living cul- ture to labour, amid a largely Philistine society, to serve the advancement of knowledge. If a centennial volume is ever projected by the B.R.S. in 20IO, what will there be to include between its covers? The contributors to this volume were, to a remarkable extent, amateurs (civil servants, for the most part), while the professional scholars did their research in scanty free time, which they somehow con- trived amid the pressures of building up a new university in a period of sudden, violent, political and social change. Where, today, are their successors? The Burmese officials of today appear to have absorbed nothing of the old tra- dition of amateur scholarship, and the aca- demics profess themselves to be so busy at ad- ministration and teaching as to have no time for research. A few valiant souls struggle on; but a real spirit of inquiry will have to be re- born if the Burma Research Society and what it stands for are to have any meaning in the future.
