The purpose of this article is to argue for a revival of Aristotle's biological teleology as a reasonable alternative to biological nihilism. The arti- cle begins with Edward Wilson's vain struggle against nihilism. Then it is argued that a teleologica! understanding of nature is assumed in the practice of medicine, as illustrated by one case from Oliver Sacks' neurological practice. The article then consid- ers the importance of biological teleology for Aris- totle's moral and political philosophy, and attention is given to some points of agreement and disagreement with contemporary sociobiologists. The main part of the article is then devoted to a defense of Aristotle's biology against the five objections that might be made by a Darwinian biologist. Finally, the article illustrates the practical implications of this issue for bioethics by considering the recent work of Engel- hardt. Modern biology confirms Friedrich Nietzsche's pre- diction that the twentieth century would be the century of nihilism. Modern Darwinian biology seems to teach us that we are just one form of life among many, with no natural end or purpose except to survive and reproduce. And now progress in genetic engineering seems to point to the future possibility that human nature will become material to be re- shaped in whatever way we desire, unconstrained by any norm other than our arbitrary preferences. We thus confront the abysmal thought of nihilism? that there is no rationally discoverable standard in nature for guiding human life. Recent books by E. 0. Wilson, M. Ruse, and H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr., illustrate some of the futile attempts to overcome nihilism through a new moral- ity consistent with the moral and epistemologica! skepticism of modern science. Their failure forces us to consider alternatives. I will argue that the best alternative is to revive Aristotle's teleological biology as supporting the idea that we can look to human nature as a source of moral and political norms. I will begin with Wilson's vain struggle against nihilism as an example of the moral predicament of the modern Darwinian biologist. I will then argue that Aristotle's understanding of nature is assumed in the ordinary practice of medicine, and I will use one of Oliver Sacks' clinical cases as an illustration. Since many readers of Aristotle's moral and political writings might deny that those works depend upon his biology, I will show how his biological reasoning enters his moral and political philosophy. Although Aristotle would agree with much of what has been argued recently by the sociobiologists, I will show that he did not make the mistakes that Kitcher attributes to "pop sociobiology." I will then defend Aristotle's biological teleology against the five objec- POLITICS AND THE LIFE SCIENCES, Vol. 6, No. 2. February 1988 ISSN 0730-9384.

Finally, I will comment on Engelhardt's theory of bioethics; and I will maintain that he falls into nihilistic incoherence because of his denial of Aris- totle's commonsense realism. Nihilism in Modern Biology In On Human Nature, Wilson (1978:1-13) warns his reader in the first chapter that modern biology has created "two great spiritual dilemmas." The first dilemma arises because biology teaches us that we have no transcendent goals. For if human beings and all other forms of life have emerged simply as products of chance and necessity, we must con- clude that there is no purpose in nature beyond the instinct of each living being to survive and repro- duce. Even the human mind, which traditionally was thought to give man his unique status as the only rational animal, must be seen as a physical device for survival and reproduction. But if we agreed that human life had no transcendent meaning, would there not be the danger of declining into a state of self-indulgent hedonism? If we decided that we have nothing to do in life except to live and reproduce, would we not lose that sense of nobility that makes life worth living? Would we not, consequently, lack any motivation for the exertions necessary to sustain civilization? Wilson's second dilemma only intensi- fies the problem: as our biological knowledge gives us greater power to control the genetic mechanism, "we shall have to decide how human we wish to remain" (1978:6). We shall have to survey the mental inclinations we have inherited as elements of our biological nature and decide which ones should be favored over the others. Wilson (1979:195-209) attempts to resolve these dilemmas in the concluding chapter of his book. He suggests that we develop a "biology of ethics" based on a "more deeply understood and enduring code of moral values" than has been possible previously. He proposes three primary values: "the survival of human genes in the form of a common pool over generations," "diversity in the gene pool," and "universal human rights." But it is hard to see why we should accept the first two values as moral norms. Is mere genetic survival the highest standard of moral worth? If so, should we honor the nobility of the amoeba? Similarly, Wilson's account of "univer- sal human rights" is vague. He seems to have in mind some kind of biologically based Hobbesian social contract (see Wilson, 1979:46, 50-51, 156-57, 164, 166-67, 198-99). All individuals are equal in their striving for reproductive success, and therefore ev- ery community should be seen by all its members as serving the reproductive interests of all. Again, however, it is hard to see how reproduction can be a source of moral obligation. Even Wilson (1979:199) concedes that we must go "beyond the utilitarian calculus of genetic fitness" if we want to create a sense of nobility in the service of our new values. Morality depends upon religion and mythology. Wilson suggests that scientific ma- terialism can become the new mythology. After all, the "evolutionary epic" is the best myth and the hero of the epic is the human mind. (For a similar proposal see Monod, 1972:3-22, 166-80.) Science itself will become a heroic quest inspiring the crea- tion of new values, and in the service of scientific materialism we might find some human fulfillment beyond animal survival. This would be a difficult project because it would rest upon a self-imposed illusion. It would have to be an illusion because Wilson assumes that any belief in heroic transcen- dence is ultimately merely a mechanism for survival and reproductive success. It is not surprising that Wilson is fond of quoting Nietzsche's remark at the end of The Genealogy of Morals: man would rather will nothingness than not will. Some of Wilson's critics claim that he is so rigid in his biological determinism that he disregards the great flexibility human beings have as moral and cultural beings. But many of these critics also turn out to be nihilists. Greenwood (1984:204), for exam- ple, a biocultural anthropologist, has argued that Darwinian biology shows us that natural laws cannot support moral principles. We must conclude, there- fore, that "our political and moral preferences are no more (and no less) than preferences." To appeal to culture rather than biology as the source of morality gives us no escape from the arbitrariness of all values. If we want to look to human nature as the ground of morality, we have a good reason to reconsider Aristotle's biological understanding of human na- ture. In fact, some students of modern biology insist that recent advances in science should give us a better grasp of the natural basis of morality (Tiger and Fox, 1971:232-41; Eibl-Eibesfeldt, 1974:1-7, 90- 105; Masters, 1975, 1978, 1986; Stent, 1980). One example of the Aristotelian point of view is a recent article by Gaylin (1984), who is president of the Hastings Center. After noting that modern science sometimes seems to deny the traditional conception of human beings as uniquely noble, as set apart from and above all other species, Gaylin sets out to defend the traditional belief in the special dignity of human beings. He identifies at least five unique attributes of our species: "conceptual thought; the capacity for technology; the range of human emo- tions; a 'Lamarkian' genetics; and... freedom from instinctual fixation" (1984:20). He does not, however, explain or defend explicitly his fundamental assump- tion, which is that the traditional teleologica! con- ception of nature is still rationally defensible. He assumes that species have natural ends or pur-</page><page sequence="3">175 poses, that there is a natural hierarchy among species, and that because man is the highest spe- cies, his ends are supreme by nature. Kass' recent book?Toward a More Natural Sci- ence (1985)?is a more elaborately developed de- fense of the traditional understanding of nature. He is explicit in his allegiance to Aristotelian teleology. He is also Aristotelian in his respect for the common experience of medical practitioners. Even if biologi- cal and medical research seems dominated by the modern quest to conquer nature, Kass draws atten- tion to the ways in which some doctors continue to see themselves, in the Hippocratic tradition, as serving nature's ends. (For an assessment of Kass' work, see Arnhart, 1987b.) That can be true even in a new branch of medical practice such as clinical neurology. Nature and Neurology Oliver Sacks is a neurologist who has written a series of popular books based on his clinical experi- ence. In his most recent book (1985:87-96), he tells the story of a patient named Ray who suffers from Tourette's syndrome. I introduce this story as an instructive illustration of how the Aristotelian under- standing of nature as a source of standards can govern medical practice. Those afflicted with Tourette's syndrome are over- whelmed by nervous energy that explodes in jerks, tics, cursing, and a generally weird and comic frenzy. Apparently these people suffer from an ex- cess of dopamine, which is one of the excitor transmitters in the brain. The drug haloperidol (or "haldol") can help these people because it de- creases the level of dopamine in the brain. Sacks, however, found that Ray was reluctant to accept the effects of haldol. Having been a Touretter since early childhood, Ray had not only adjusted to his disorder but had exploited the wild and frenetic energy that it provided. His friends enjoyed his explosive wit. He was an excellent ping-pong player because of his quick and unexpected shots. He used his fast reflexes to jump into and out of revolving doors with amazing speed. And as a weekend jazz drummer, he was famous for his frenzied and inventive improvisation. He spoke of himself as "witty ticcy Ray," known for his "ticcy witticisms and witty ticcisms." He told Sacks he was not sure he wanted to live without Tourette's syndrome. (After his first week on haldol, he had a broken nose caused by a revolving door.) "Suppose you could take away the tics," he said. "What would be left? I consist of tics?there'd be nothing left." Yet Ray had come to Sacks because he felt enslaved by his disorder. So the doctor suggested that they should meet weekly for three months to discuss what life without Tourette's might be like. Then the haldol was tried once again. It worked, and Ray enjoyed his freedom from the confinement of Tourette's. But he also felt that he had lost some- thing. His greatest loss was that his jazz drumming became dull and lifeless. He decided to compro- mise. He would take haldol during the working week but not on weekends. From Monday to Friday he was a calm, conservative member of his community. But on weekends he became the frenzied jazz drummer?"witty ticcy Ray." Ray explained his precarious situation this way: Having Tourette's is wild, like being drunk all the while. Being on haldol is dull, makes one square and sober, and neither state is really free.... You 'normals', who have the right trans- mitters in the right places at the right times in your brains, have all feelings, all states, available all the time?gravity, levity, whatever is appropri- ate. We Touretters don't: We are forced into levity by our Tourette's and forced into gravity when we take haldol. You are free, you have a natural balance: We must make the best of an artificial balance. According to Sacks, Ray has achieved a full life "despite being deprived of the birthright of natural freedom which most of us enjoy." This story illustrates some of the moral?and ultimately political?issues that arise in the practice of modern medicine and biology. It's one example of how recent advances in our biological knowledge give us an unprecedented power over nature, in- cluding power over that most distinctive part of our human nature?the brain. Even the capacity that many people have traditionally thought must tran- scend the physical mechanism of the body?the "soul" or "self," the source of willing and thinking? even that seems open now to neurological explana- tion and control. We must wonder, however, whether this new scientific knowledge includes a knowledge of the ends for which its power will be used. Sacks assumes in his neurological practice that the end comes from nature. There is a natural order or balance in any normal human life. He can there- fore recognize Tourette's syndrome as a "disorder" or "disturbance" of the natural functioning that is the healthy condition of a normal human being. Although in Ray's case he cannot completely repair the damage, he can at least strive for an "artificial balance" that approximates the "natural balance" of normal life. All of Sacks' patients have lost contact with some part of reality because of some neurological defect. His job is to help them find some road back to reality. So, for example, if an autistic patient cannot comprehend the world in an abstract, intellectual</page><page sequence="4">176 way, perhaps he can learn through music or dance to experience the world in its concrete immediacy. Sacks thus assumes that nature is purposeful and the doctor's duty is to assist nature in fulfilling its purposes. Although the patient must consent to the treatment, the doctor is not merely a servant of the patient's wishes, because the standard of health is fixed by nature even if there is flexibility in deciding how best to approximate nature's norm. Moreover, I suspect that Ray's final assessment of his situation as quoted above was largely a result of Sacks' gentle persuasion. Isn't it likely that Ray's subtle understanding of the "natural balance" between gravity and levity reflects Sacks' wise judgment about what constitutes psychic health? And doesn't that idea of "natural balance" conform to what Aristotle would call a natural mean between excess and defect? Sacks in his writing often admires the wondrous insights and exhilaration experienced by people with neurological disturbances. But he never yields to the sentimental relativism that would deny the distinction between the normal and the abnormal, the healthy and the diseased. In short, Sacks as- sumes, at least implicitly, a teleologica! conception of nature. Yet it has been widely assumed that modern science?and certainly modern biology?cannot support the idea of nature as teleologica!. Beginning with Descartes and Bacon, modern science has apparently been devoted not to discovering nature's order so that we can conform to it, but to studying nature's mechanism so that we can control it (Berns, 1978; Kass, 1985; Isaacs, 1987). We cannot discover our proper goals or purposes as features of nature. Rather we must create our own ends and then impose them on nature. Therefore, to understand how nature might guide the practice of those like Sacks, we must revive the premodern account of nature found in Aristotle's biology. But surely some readers would wonder at this point about the relevance of all this for political thought. As important as Aristotle's teleologica! biology may be for medical practice, it might still be unclear whether his biology is critical for the sort of political thinking found in his Nicomachean Ethics and Politics. Do we find in Aristotle's work a funda- mental connection between biology, medicine, and political science? Aristotle's Biopolitics For Aristotle, biological explanation requires two steps. We must first specify the functional organiza- tion of a normal adult of the species being consid- ered. Then we must show how each organic process or pattern of behavior contributes to the functional organization of the being in question. We explain a biological phenomenon by indicating how it en- hances the flourishing of the mature organism. Aris- totle follows the same procedure in the Nicomachean Ethics and Politics: he investigates human virtue as that which promotes the flourishing of a mature human life. We are not disembodied intellects. We are not machines. We are animals. But we are a special kind of animal: We are rational animals. That is our nature. From birth, therefore, we have the natural inclinations that identify us as rational animals. But to fulfill or complete those inclinations we need material resources, proper habituation, and intellec- tual stimulation. For example, we are naturally en- dowed with a capacity for language, but we cannot exercise that capacity unless we are taught a lan- guage. Thus we need culture to complete our na- ture. We can say, therefore, that whatever enhances the flourishing of our nature is good, and whatever impedes that flourishing is bad. By this standard we can judge as good or bad, better or worse, the life of an individual human being or the life of a political community. In this way Aristotle looks to our biologi- cal nature as rational animals for guidance in his moral and political reasoning. The first principle of Aristotle's ethics is that happiness is the activity of the soul according to virtue throughout life (NE 1097a26-98a22, 1099b32- 1100a5,1102a14-3a10).1 Reflection on the biological nature of human beings is critical to the establish- ment of this principle. We see that all human beings seek happiness as the fulfillment of their desires. But since people disagree about what true happi- ness is, we must reflect on the kind of beings that human beings are to see if there is some work or function distinctive to them that would define their happiness. All human beings seek to preserve them- selves. But the capacities for nutrition and growth are found in all living things and are not therefore distinctively human. Similarly, the capacities for sensation, desire, and movement are possessed by other animals. But the capacity for purposeful con- duct guided by rational deliberation is uniquely human. Therefore, human happiness must be the active exercise of this capacity. Other animals can- not be truly happy in this sense. Even human children can be said to be only potentially happy. The flourishing of a human being that constitutes happiness is attained only by normal, mature adults. Consequently, the political scientist must have some knowledge of the human soul as one form of animal life (NE 1102a18-25). Of course it is appropri- ate for him to pursue this study only as an aid to politics, which means that he will not need the detailed knowledge of a physician or a natural scientist.</page><page sequence="5">177 I would emphasize that although Aristotle often identifies happiness with the exercise of those activ- ities that are uniquely human, he also insists that happiness includes the satisfaction of those needs that human beings share with other living things. Furthermore, since human goodness coincides with the necessary conditions for human life, absolute badness is impossible because an absolutely bad human being would self-destruct. Insofar as an individual knows how to stay alive even the worst of human beings must know something about what is good for him or herself. Likewise, any political regime that endures for long cannot be absolutely tyrannical (NE 1126a12-13, 1153b25-54a2, 1172b35- 73a5; ? 1302a4-7, 1309b15-10a12, 1315b5-39, 1323a27-34). On this point?that morality must se- cure the conditions of human life?Aristotle would agree with David Hume. The first condition of life is food. Animals are adapted by nature for different kinds of life corre- sponding to the different ways of acquiring food (P 1256a20-b27). Some, for example, are carnivorous and others frugivorous. Similarly, human beings have different ways of life as determined by their source of food. Some are nomadic shepherds, some hunters, some farmers, some merchants. Human community arises first, Aristotle explains, from the urge for sexual union. By necessity, then, there is first the coupling of those who cannot exist without one an- other. .. male and female for the sake of repro- duction (and this is not from moral choice but, just as with the other animals and plants, there is a natural longing to leave behind another of the same sort as oneself)... (P 1252a26-30) The coupling of husband and wife is even more natural than political bonding because the sexual union is prior and more necessary, and procreation is more common in animals (NE 1162a17-29). Unlike other animals, however, "human beings live to- gether not only for the sake of reproduction but for other things in life as well." When Aristotle speaks of friendship as one of the necessary elements of a good life, he explains it as a biological need that human beings share with other animals. It seems that by nature parents show a friendly feeling for their offspring, and the offspring for their parents, not only among human beings but also among birds and most animals, and the same is felt among those of the same kind towards one another, and especially among hu- man beings, so that we praise those who are friendly to one another.... Moreover, friendship seems to hold a city together. (NE 1155a17-23) The desire for bonding is one of the motives for the movement of animals. And one of the clearest links between Aristotle's biological work and his ethics is his explanation of animal movement (DM 698a1-7, 700b4-2a21; NE 1141b14-23, 1142b23-33, 1142a35-b6, 1146b31-47b19; Nussbaum, 1978). On the Movement of Animals provides a general expla- nation for any animal movement, including human action. Aristotle's most important idea is that the structure of animal movement resembles the struc- ture of a syllogism. The idea of a "practical syllo- gism" allows Aristotle to explain all animal move- ment teleologically. The syllogism unites cognition and desire in two premises. The major premise posits a goal as desirable. The minor premise states how the goal can be attained in the particular circumstances at hand. He uses this same explana- tory model in the Nicomachean Ethics to explain prudence and incontinence. So, although Aristotle believes moral action is uniquely human, he also regards it as one kind of animal movement in that it displays the same general structure. And the most important feature of that structure is its teleologica! character. "For all animals both move and are moved for the sake of something, so this is the limit of all their movement: the thing-for-the-sake-of- which"(DM700b14-16). Human movement can differ from that of other animals in that, while human beings can act through deliberate judgments about general principles, other animals are moved only by perceptual imagination and memory of particular things. That is why only human beings are capable of "moral choice" (proairesis) defined as "a deliberate desire of things in our power" (DA 428a20-25, 433b31-34a22; Meta 980b25-27; NE 111104-18, 1113a10-13, 1139a19-20, 1147b4-6). As with the movement of all animals, human beings are moved initially by innate biological dispo- sitions, which constitute the fundamental structure of human motivation. But to develop their natural dispositions into moral conduct, human beings need the proper habituation and the proper intellectual judgment. Aristotle distinguishes between natural virtue (based on innate dispositions), moral virtue (based on habituation), and virtue in the strict sense (based on prudential judgment). Nature and habit come first and are sufficient for most people. Only a few people possess the prudential knowledge of what right reason dictates in each case (NE 1095a2- 4, 1095b2-8f, 1103a14-26, 1144b1-45a2, 1179b4-31; P1332a39-b8, 1334M5-17). Nature does not impose a strictly predetermined pattern upon human action, but the natural inclina- tions of human beings do provide them with the materials that habit and reason can perfect. "Hence virtues arise in us neither by nature nor contrary to nature; but by our nature we can receive them and perfect them by habituation" (NE 1103a14-25). Un-</page><page sequence="6">178 like other animals, therefore, the nature of human beings is not completed automatically, because human nature depends upon the right cultural con- ventions. And in being thus open to a perfection of which other animals are incapable, human beings are also open to a corruption into which other animals cannot fall. "For just as man is the best of animals when completed, when separated from law and adjudication he is the worst of all" (P 1253a31- 33). As G. K. Chesterton observed, human beings are the only wild animals because by comparison all other animals are tame. Consequently, the proper formation of human character requires a complex and delicate combination of natural dispositions, social habituation, and external circumstances. (That this Aristotelian understanding of human na- ture can still be a powerful tool for the contemporary social scientist is evident in Wilson and Herrnstein's (1985:508-29) Aristotelian analysis of criminal con- duct. Compare Aristotle's criminology in his Rheto- ric, 1368b1-1373b1; and see Arnhart, 1981:87-101.) Human beings are especially vulnerable to corrup- tion through the allurement of improper pleasures. But Aristotle's recognition of the natural ends of human beings as a distinct species allows him to distinguish natural and unnatural pleasures. Some things are by nature pleasant, and of these some are pleasant to certain genera of animals and men, but others are pleasant not by nature but through habit or through natural depravity. (A/E1148b15-18) It seems that each animal has a proper pleasure, just as it has a proper function; for a pleasure is proper to the corresponding activity of a func- tion. This will appear to be so if we study each species; for the pleasures of a horse, of a dog, and of a man are different_So whether there is one or more than one activity that belongs to the complete and blessed man, it is the pleasures that complete those activities that will be said to be in the fullest sense the distinctively human pleasures. (NE 1176a4-33) Now that I have indicated some of the ways that Aristotle's biological claims enter the Nicomachean Ethics and Politics, surely some readers would object that, insofar as Aristotle's biological observa- tions in the moral and political works are based on common sense, his strictly biological works are not essential for our understanding of his political phi- losophy. I would argue in response, however, that Aristotle's biological works are critical in providing theoretical support for the biological assumptions of moral practice. This becomes clear if one compares Aristotle and Locke on this point. An important principle for Locke's argument in the Second Trea- tise (1970:secs. 4, 6) is that all men are equal in their human dignity insofar as they are all members of the human species as distinguished from "the inferior ranks of creatures." But in his An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1959:bk. 3, chap. 6, sees. 20-39), Locke denies that we can really know whether there are any essential differences between human beings and other species of animals. Thus, the political teaching of Locke seems to lack theo- retical support. But this is not the case for Aristotle. Furthermore, we can see in the work of Hobbes how the rejection of Aristotle's teleological biology leads to the rejection of his teleological ethics. In De Corpore (1839:viii-ix, 406-8), Hobbes uses the con- cept of "vital motion" to extend Harvey's explana- tion of the motion of blood. "Now vital motion is the motion of the blood, perpetually circulating (as hath been shown from many infallible signs and marks by Doctor Harvey, the first observer of it) in the veins and arteries." By identifying life with the motion of blood, Hobbes explains life as a mechanistic motion with no end or purpose. He can then begin The Leviathan ([1651] n.d.) by declaring that "life is but a motion of limbs." The only natural inclination of a living creature is the striving to continue its motion, which for human beings becomes a desire for self- preservation and its attendant fear of death. Since there are no final ends in nature, life must be an endless pursuit of the desires. So if we decided that Hobbes was right in rejecting Aristotle's teleological biology, we would find it hard to defend Aristotle's teleological ethics. I suspect that the primary reason why many of Aristotle's readers today are reluctant to accept the link between his biology and his ethics is their fear of "biological reductionism." To say that Aristotle looks to biology for ethical guidance makes him sound like a sociobiologist. But surely Aristotle would not accept the sociobiological claim that ethics is simply a mechanism for promoting repro- ductive success. Aristotle would agree with some features of sociobiology while rejecting those that can be rightly criticized. Aristotle and Sociobiology Perhaps the most persuasive critique of sociobi- ology is Kitcher's Vaulting Ambition (1985). Unlike most other critics he acknowledges the accomplish- ments of sociobiology in applying biological insights to explain the behavior of nonhuman animals. He also concedes that in the future this research could be extended to cover human behavior. He does not deny that human beings have biological proclivities that influence their behavior. Yet he criticizes those he calls "pop sociobiologists" for moving too quickly to grand speculations about human nature, speculations that have neither the theoretical rigor nor the empirical support found in the best sociobio- logical studies of nonhuman behavior. The subjects of his attack include E. Wilson, R. Alexander, R.</page><page sequence="7">179 Trivers, R. Dawkins, D. Barash, P. van den Berghe, and ?. Chagnon. Some of the reviewers of Kitcher's book have praised him for being more meticulous and fair- minded than critics such as Lewontin and Gould. Even those reviewers who remain unpersuaded have not been able to expose any fundamental flaws in Kitcher's arguments. (For a sampling of the reviews, see Betzig, 1986; Daly, 1986; Gould, 1986; Kitcher, 1987; Konner, 1985; J. M. Smith, 1985; P. K. Smith, 1986; Whitney, 1986. See also Alexander, 1987:10-11, 30-33.) Nevertheless, I think he can be challenged on some points. But for my defense of Aristotle, it is not essential to decide whether his critique of sociobiology is entirely correct. My con- cern is to show that, even if it were correct on every point, it would not apply to Aristotle's biological understanding of human nature. Pop sociobiologists assume that evolution coin- cides with natural selection, which optimizes the adaptation of traits for fitness. But as Kitcher indi- cates (1985:213-39, 288), evolution does not always promote optimal conditions. Sometimes natural se- lection favors the survival of the fittest. Yet some- times it favors the demise of the fittest. Moreover, other mechanisms of evolution can interfere with the optimizing effects of evolution. Regrettably, how- ever, Kitcher exaggerates the extent to which soci- obiologists rely on unreasonable adaptationism. (For the debate on this issue, see Dawkins, 1982:30-54; Gould, 1986; Lewontin, 1979; Mayr, 1983a.) Although, of course, Aristotle does not rely on evolution by natural selection, his teleological biol- ogy might seem to display the same "Panglossian optimism" that Kitcher sees in the pop sociologists. After all, doesn't Aristotle insist that nature does nothing in vain, that everything serves some natural purpose? On the contrary, as I shall show later, Aristotle does not believe that nature's ends are always perfectly attained. In many cases, things happen by chance or by necessity for which there are no explanations in terms of final ends. Perhaps the primary claim of pop sociobiology is that as a consequence of human evolution, individu- als always strive (even if unconsciously) to maximize their reproductive fitness. Behavioral traits such as aggressiveness, male dominance, male and female sexual strategies, and parent-offspring conflict are all explained as ultimately serving reproductive suc- cess. Although conceding that in many cases this is true, Kitcher (1985:180,196-201, 268-69) notes situa- tions where this explanation is insufficient. Particu- larly in modern urban societies, the complex interac- tion of cognitive, cultural, and environmental factors can induce human beings to act in ways that do not enhance their reproductive fitness. It is not always true, for example, that those who are most socially successful (in wealth, prestige, and so on) are also most successful in reproduction. (On this point see Vining, 1986 and the accompanying commentaries.) Obviously, this is not a problem for Aristotle. As we have seen, he recognizes the desires for sexual coupling and the rearing of children as powerful inclinations. But reproduction is not the only end even of familial bonding. Although sociobiologists such as Wilson admit that human behavior arises from the interaction of genetic inclinations and environmental conditions, Kitcher criticizes them for giving too little weight to cultural and cognitive factors and too much weight to genetic determination. Again, this criticism would not apply to Aristotle. As we have seen, he explains human conduct as guided by a combination of factors?natural inclinations, patterns of habituation, and cultural learning. Aristotle would agree with Kitcher's claim (1985:328-29) that "human beings have propensities that lead them, when they grow up in certain social and physical environments, to acquire as adults the desires and aspirations with which we are familiar." He would agree with Kitcher (1985:268-69, 288, 297-98) that we are born with biological propensities, but that these innate drives shape our conduct only in combination with our culture, our reasoning, our physical circumstances, and other factors. One of the most common criticisms of the pop sociobiologists is that they want to find biological support for their ideological prejudices. I would agree with Masters (1982) that this criticism is not completely fair. But some sociobiologists do sug- gest, for example, that sexual inequality is grounded in biological differences (Wilson, 1978:121-48; Ba- rash, 1981:46-131). Even Darwin (1874:873) as- serted, without supporting evidence, that "the aver- age of mental power in man must be above that of woman." Aristotle would seem to make the same mistake when he speaks of sexual inequality and slavery as being biologically determined. I believe it is incorrect, however, to read Aristotle as endorsing the Greek exploitation of women and slaves. Al- though prudence dictated that he could not openly condemn such exploitation, his remarks are ambigu- ous in ways that suggest he saw the need for moral reform. Aristotle thought there were some natural differ- ences between men and women that influenced their conduct. But he argued that women were not to be exploited as though they were the slaves of men. While the man's rule over his children is monarchic, his rule over his wife is "political." And "political" rule means ruling over those who are free and equal (P 1255b18-21, 1259b1-3). Aristotle thought male and female were two parts of human nature. He therefore believed marriage was impor-</page><page sequence="8">180 tant as a friendly union of male and female virtues that expressed complete humanity. Marital friend- ship is such that "by contributing to the common stock whatever is proper to each they supply each other's needs." At its best, it is a friendship of virtue, "for each sex has its virtue" (NE 1162a17-29). Aristotle's thinking resembles that of Gilligan (1982) in her work on the subtle differences between men and women in their moral reasoning. (The complex- ity of Aristotle's understanding of male and female roles has been made clear by Salkever, 1983.) Similarly, Aristotle's comments on slavery suggest that his biological understanding of the unity of the human species would deny the arguments for slav- ery. His cautious reluctance to express this openly, however, has made it difficult for readers to discern his intent. Nevertheless, it should be clear to any careful reader that his distinction between "natural" and "conventional" slavery is such that slavery as actually practiced in antiquity would have to be considered merely "conventional" (P 1254a18-19, 1254b20-22). For slavery to be natural the slave would have to be an irrational animal. But Aristotle says that although some slaves may be intellectually inferior to their masters, all slaves possess the rationality that identifies them as human beings rather than brute animals (P 1254b15-25, 1259b29, 1330a26-34). In the Politics (1255b9-15), Aristotle says that natural slavery would require "common interest" and "friendship" between master and slave. But in the Nicomachean Ethics (1161b5-8), he argues that since friendship is possible only between human beings, "there can be no friendship with a slave as a slave, though there can be with him as a human being." He leaves the reader free to draw the obvious conclusions. To enslave a human being is unnatural because it denies the fact of his humanity as a rational being. To justify slavery as natural, a master must try to be a friend to his slave, but the very possibility of friendship presupposes the hu- manity of the slave and therefore the injustice of his enslavement. Thus does Aristotle point to the absur- dity that was indicated by Lincoln in his arguments against slavery (1953, 2:222-23, 2:264-66, 2:271, 2:274-75, 2:281-81, 2:405-7, 3:93, 3:204-5). All human beings are equal by nature insofar as they are all equally members of the human species (Jaffa, 1973:308-29, 1975:149-60). We can condemn slavery as unjust because it denies our shared humanity in treating some human beings as if they were brute animals. But if we do this, we assume that we can properly appeal to biological facts to support moral judgments. Kitcher and other critics of sociobiology argue that this cannot be done. To derive moral norms from biologi- cal facts is to commit the "naturalistic fallacy" (Kitcher, 1985:421-34). Kitcher points to the moral theory of Rawls (1981) as an illustration of how we might avoid this fallacy in our moral reasoning. But, in fact, Rawls' moral theory illustrates the impossibility of making moral judgments without appealing to human nature as a source of norms. For instance, Rawls maintains that equal liberty takes precedence over other principles because of "the central place of the primary good of self-respect and the desire of human beings to express their nature in a free social union with others" (1981:543). And more generally, Rawls claims that the principles of justice allow people to "express their nature as free and equal rational beings subject to the general conditions of human life" (1981:252-53). If our moral judgments inevitably depend on some conception of how human nature can be best ful- filled, then we must reconsider Aristotle's teleologi- cal ethics. But if his teleological ethics presupposes his teleological biology, then we must wonder whether his teleological understanding of biology is defensible. Aristotle's Teleological Biology To defend Aristotle's teleological biology I will re- spond to the five most obvious objections of the Darwinian scientist. One objection is that Aristotle's biological teleology is anthropomorphic or theologi- cal in its personification of nature as a rational artist with a cosmic design. A second objection is that as a result of Darwin's work, we can no longer accept the eternity of fixed species, which Aristotle as- sumes. A third criticism would be that Aristotle's preoccupation with final ends violates the mechanis- tic spirit of modern science in its search for physical causes. As a fourth objection, modern critics would say that Aristotle's teleology confuses natural laws and moral laws. Finally, it would seem that when Darwin denied that human beings were different in kind from other animals, he challenged Aristotle's claim that humans are at the highest peak in the natural order. I will draw ideas from Aristotle's biological works to answer each of these criticisms. I will rely primarily upon his Parts of Animals and his Generation of Animals. But I will also refer in a few cases to his History of Animals and De Anima (On the Soul). Is Nature an Artist? To explain the artfulness of nature, Aristotle com- pares nature to a prudent human being, a carpenter, a clay-modeller, a cook, a housekeeper, a painter, and a runner (PA 687a7-13; GA 730b5-30, 741 b17-24, 743a17-27, 743b19-25, 744b12-27, 776a1-8). But Ar- istotle clearly intends this to be interpreted meta-</page><page sequence="9">181 phorically rather than literally. (On metaphor, see Aristotle's Rhetoric 1410b6-13b1.) Darwin employs a similar metaphor. "In the literal sense of the word," Darwin (1872:64) concedes, "natural selection is a false term." But it is a useful metaphorical expres- sion to personify nature although strictly speaking the word nature means "only the aggregate action and product of many natural laws." Aristotle and Darwin agree, therefore, that in some manner nature imitates art. For Aristotle that means that nature acts through four causes. Near the beginning of the Parts of Animals (639b8- 46b5), Aristotle argues that of the four causes of natural phenomena, the final and formal causes are more important than the efficient and material causes. Just as in art we must first know the end or purpose of the artist, so in nature we must first know the goal for which nature works. This is the final cause towards which a formative process moves, that for the sake of which it advances. Once we know this, then we can study the efficient cause, the agent by which some natural object is made. Simi- larly, the formal cause, which is the distinctive shape or essence of something, determines what the thing is. And therefore it is more important than the material cause, which is the matter out of which the thing is formed. The form of any living thing is its "soul" (psyche). All plants and animals are moved by some part of soul. But only humans are guided by intellective soul (nous). That nature conforms to this order of causes is evident in the development of living beings. Growth is not by chance. When individual living beings act as efficient causes in producing seeds, nature deter- mines the end towards which the formative process of growth will move. Yet this growth from potentiality to actuality is governed not only by the final cause but also by material necessity. If the end is to be attained, then the necessary conditions for the emergence of that end must be present. For exam- ple, the growth of any animal to maturity depends upon nourishment as a necessary condition. This last point is important if we are to appreciate the reasonableness of Aristotle's biological teach- ing. According to his teleological conception of nature, final and formal causes are primary. But he does not neglect efficient and material causes. The form and end of a living being are first in thought, but the matter and the formative process come first intime(P4 646a25-46b10). Although living things are not eternal, they are still wonderful in their beauty because each is ordered by nature for a purpose (PA 644b22-45b20). Aristotle even speaks sometimes of this natural order as somehow reflecting the divine. And, of course, bibli- cal theologians have interpreted this as evidence of God's handiwork. But Aristotle never draws this conclusion. For example, he notes that the sense- organs (eyes, ears, nostrils, and tongue) are located where they can best perform their proper functions. Traditionally this was cited as evidence for a divine creator (see Xenophon, Memorabilia I, 4). But Aris- totle says nothing about this. He does not posit a Platonic demiurge (Meta 1079b24-27). His teleologi- cal biology should not be confused with the Genesis account of creation. Aristotle does seem to agree with the Bible, however, on some points, such as the fixity of species. Is There Any Fixity in the Flux of Nature? Aristotle distinguishes those things that are eternal and divine from those things that come into being and pass away. Although the latter cannot be strictly eternal, they can in some manner participate in eternity. Living beings are not eternal as individuals, but the species of which they are members are eternal (DA 415a26-15b8; GA 731b18-32a3). Through the reproduction of offspring, living beings attain a kind of immortality. Individual identity passes away, but the specific form exemplified in the individual endures. Human beings are mortal, yet humanity is immortal. But if we accept Darwin's teaching about the development of species out of other species, we would have to reject Aristotle's belief in the perma- nence of the species. What prevented Aristotle from seriously considering the possibility of the evolution of the species? Does this show that Aristotle was less rigorous in his science than Darwin? If we accept Darwin's teaching, must we reject Aristotle's teleological conception of nature? Most of the biological phenomena interpreted by Darwin as evidence of evolution were observed by Aristotle. Most importantly, Aristotle was aware of how slight the differences are between similar spe- cies. Sea-squirts, he observed (PA 681 a10-15), differ but slightly in their nature from plants, and yet they are more like animals than are the sponges, for these completely have the charac- ter of plants. For nature passes in a continuous sequence from lifeless things to animals, through living things that are not animals, so that the differences between neighboring groups seem very small because they are so close. He recognizes many intermediate species that stand between water-animals and land-animals (such as dolphins, whales, and seals) or between land-animals and birds (such as bats and ostriches) (PA 697a15-97b26). After comparing humans as bipeds with the quadrupeds, he observes that apes are intermediate between the two, being like a biped in having no tail but like a quadruped in having no buttocks (PA 689b32-34).</page><page sequence="10">182 It cannot be said that Aristotle is less empirical in his biological studies than Darwin. Aristotle insists that the study of living things must begin with detailed observations of the sort collected in his History of Animals, which is a massive work. Only after that has been done can one properly begin to consider the causes through which each animal is as it is observed to be (PA 640a10-20, 644b22- 45a11, 646a8-12). Typically Aristotle seeks to con- firm the conclusions of logical deduction (kata ton logon) by reference to empirical deduction (kata ten aisthesin) (PA 666a19-20). In those cases where he has only a limited knowledge of the relevant facts, Aristotle refuses to draw firm conclusions. After surveying the many difficulties concerning the gen- eration of bees, he (GA 760b28-33) remarks: From reason, therefore, such appears to be the way it is with regard to the generation of bees, and from what are believed to be the events related to them. But the events have not been sufficiently grasped, and if they are grasped at some time, then credence must be given to the senses more than to reason, and to reasons if they show results agreeing with the observations. In 1651 Harvey quoted this passage to indicate that his own empirical method for biological research conformed to Aristotle's practice (Harvey [1651] 1965:158-63). The fruitfulness of Aristotle's method is evident in his embryology. He carefully compares the different kinds of embryonic development for different spe- cies. He understands that the sex of the embryo is determined at the beginning of its growth. He correctly identifies the major stages of embryonic development. He also recognizes the functions of the placenta and the umbilical cord. Of course he makes some mistakes. But most of these are due to his limited access to evidence. For example, since he relies on direct observation without the aid of a microscope, he never sees the mammalian egg, which is a single cell of microscopic size. Even when Aristotle makes a mistake, we can often see the plausibility of his reasoning. For in- stance, he believes the senses of touch and taste are connected to the heart rather than the brain, and one reason for this is that he knows that the matter of the brain has no capacity for sensation. Aristotle's claim that the female provides the matter for repro- duction and the male the form is often ridiculed as an example of male bias. But it should be noted that even the female's matter contains form in potential- ity, and thus "the residue provided by the female is potentially the same in character as the future animal will be" (GA 740a19-21). Aristotle infers that the female contributes a nutritive soul while the male contributes a sensitive soul. He regards this as a reasonable explanation of the fact that when a female's eggs are not fertilized by a male, the living material in the egg cannot grow into an animal (GA 741a4-41b25). I am emphasizing the empiricism of Aristotle's biological reasoning because I think this explains his belief in the fixity of species and his failure to consider evolution: the fixity of species is directly observable, but the evolution of species is not. We can see that apes are essentially different from human beings, but we cannot see apes and human beings evolving from common ancestors. Aristotle's biological work is much more empirical and much less speculative than Darwin's. Repeat- edly Darwin has to concede that his theory of evolution either lacks factual support or even seems to contradict certain pertinent facts (1872:13, 62, 102, 133-35, 138-39, 145-46, 151; 1874:495, 908-9). His usual rhetorical strategy in such cases is to show that his theory is not logically impossible and that the reader can at least imagine how evolution might have occurred (1872:62, 70, 134-35, 248, 254, 353). Failing to show the probability of his theory, Darwin ([1892] 1958:234) can only show its mere possibility, as though that were sufficient. One of the most obvious pieces of evidence against his theory is the absence of a finely graduated organic chain in the geological record. Indeed, this continues to be a subject of controversy among contemporary biolo- gists. Darwin's answer is that the geological record must be too imperfect to provide the proper evi- dence. But he admits that he did not suspect how poor the geological record was until he found that the record did not confirm his theory (1872:249). I am not asserting that the evidence for Darwin's theory is unpersuasive, but I am suggesting that Darwin's case cannot offer us much more than plausibility of the sort that we might find in a legal brief (Darwin, [1892] 1958:55-56; Ruse, 1973:96-121). Even if we accept the evolution of species as a fact, we must still accept the essential differences between species as an even more obvious fact. (Anthropologists have found a remarkable uniformity across cultures in the way people classify species (Berlin, Breedlove and Raven, 1974; Brown, 1984).) Even if species are not eternally fixed but have evolved from ancestral species, that does not make them any less real during the time of their existence. As Gould (1980:213) would say, "Species are stable entities with very brief periods of fuzziness at their origin." But do those natural differences among the spe- cies manifest the purposefulness of nature? Or should we see them as simply products of nature's material and mechanical laws?</page><page sequence="11">183 Does Nature Work through Necessity or through Purpose? Aristotle would answer this question by arguing that nature actually works in both ways. Although in some sense natural purposefulness is more impor- tant for Aristotle's biology than is natural necessity, both are essential to his biological reasoning. "Ev- erything that occurs is done either because it is necessary or because it is better" (GA 717a15-16). By "necessary nature" certain things occur by ne- cessity, things that "rational nature" can use for some purpose (PA 663b23-24). Therefore, we can accept Aristotle's biological teleology while still giv- ing physical causes their proper weight. Aristotle seeks to avoid the mistake of the "my- thologists" (like Herodotus), on the one hand, and the mistakes of the "physiologers" (like Democri- tus), on the other hand (GA 736a10-15, 741 b37-42a1, 756a31-57a12, 778a33-78b19, 788b10-89b22). The mythologists tell traditional fables about animal life, which may be based on unreliable reports, and which may even be physically impossible. The physiologers deserve more respect insofar as they look for material and efficient causes, but their explanations are incomplete because they ignore formal and final causes. While affirming nature as form and purpose, Aris- totle also affirms nature as matter and necessity. When by some natural necessity nature's end is not reached, this is contrary to nature in one sense but according to nature in another sense (GA 770b10- 16). So, for example, a deformity in the development of an animal is unnatural in that the usual end of such development has not been fulfilled, but it is natural insofar as even a deformity has natural physical causes. "A monstrosity is not necessary with reference to the purposive or final cause, but as an accident it is necessary" (GA 767b13-14). Aristotle does not think that every variation is perfectly adapted to some purpose. Nature some- times has to make awkward adjustments (PA 648a14-19, 658b26-59a37, 662b23-63a17, 694a14- 94b12). For example, elephants are so large and heavy that their feet can serve only as supports, and therefore they must use their trunks to do some things normally done by forefeet. Thus a nose must be used like a foot. (Compare Gould, 1980:19-26.) Some biological processes and entities arise as necessary effects without serving any definite pur- pose. The excretions of the stomach and intestine illustrate this. "For although nature sometimes uses even residues for some benefit, yet we ought not for that reason to look for some purpose in all cases" (PA 677a15-18). Aristotle would agree, therefore, with those biologists who warn against the assump- tion that nature always achieves perfect adapta- tions. "Hypothetical necessity" is part of a teleological explanation, but "simple necessity" is not. The "hypothetical necessity" by which an eye is formed with the capacity for sight serves a natural end. But the "simple necessity" by which an eye is deter- mined to be blue or brown need not serve any end (G?778a16-35). D'Arcy Thompson, an important biologist as well as a student of Aristotle's works, concluded that Aristotle saw nature as both mechanical and teleo- logical. In On Growth and Form, Thompson (1961:10) sought to show that "in general no organic forms exist save such as are in conformity with physical and mathematical laws." But he regarded this search for mechanical explanations as consistent with the search for teleological explanations. Aristotle can be defended even against Francis Bacon's criticisms of teleological reasoning. Bacon (1955:254-61) distinguishes between physics as concerned with material and efficient causes and metaphysics as concerned with formal and final causes. His complaint is not that metaphysics is untrue, but that it is incomplete when it excludes physics. Explaining nature requires inquiry into final causes as well as physical causes, "both causes being true and compatible" (1955:260). Aristotle would agree. In fact, Bacon illustrates his point with an example drawn from Aristotle's Parts of Animals (658b14-26). Aristotle explains eyelashes as serving the purpose of protecting the eyes. But he immedi- ately adds that this is caused by necessity since hair forms around orifices of moisture. The wisdom of Aristotle's combination of teleolog- ical and mechanistic analysis is confirmed by the success of many of his biological theories. One paramount example is his explanation of how the development of an embryo is guided by a pattern in the embryo from its earliest existence. It is clear that there is something that makes the parts of the embryo, but this does not exist as a definite individual, nor does it exist in the semen at first already perfect. But how does each part arise? We must answer this by taking as our starting point the principle that, whatever arises by nature or by art, arises by something actually existing out of that which is potentially such a being. (GA 734b17-22) To explain how parents act as efficient causes in determining the development of an embryo, Aristotle makes an analogy with mechanical puppets (734b9- 17). Even at rest the automaton has a potentiality for a pattern of motion fixed by its internal mechanism. From these remarks, we can understand why one modern biologist was able to give a lecture with the title "How Aristotle Discovered DNA" (Delbrock, 1976).</page><page sequence="12">184 One of the greatest controversies in the history of embryology was the conflict between the theory of "preformation" and the theory of "epig?nesis." Ac- cording to the first theory, a fertilized egg contains a tiny adult that grows in size without any structural changes. According to the other, the egg is amor- phous at the beginning, and the development is a gradual differentiation of parts leading to the adult. Modern biologists finally resolved this controversy by finding some truth in both theories. Mayr (1982:106) has explained, "the epigenesists were correct in stating that the egg at its beginning is essentially undifferentiated, and the preformationists were correct that its development is controlled by something preformed, now recognized as the ge- netic program." So after thousands of years of debate, biologists now agree that Aristotle was essentially correct: we cannot explain the develop- ment of unorganized matter into a complex organ- ism unless we see that some potential "form" (eidos) is thereby actualized as the "end" (telos) of the growth. Not only in embryology but in every area of biology, Aristotle would insist, the scientist cannot fully understand living beings unless he asks about their natural purposes or goals. Modern biologists such as Mayr would agree. "Aristotelian why-ques- tions have played an important heuristic role in the history of biology. 'Why?' is the most important question the evolutionary biologist asks in all of his researches" (Mayr, 1982:89). Surely some modern biologists would object that progress in molecular biology will eventually make it unnecessary for biologists to rely on Aristotelian teleology. The breaking of the genetic code and subsequent research at the molecular level would seem to suggest the possibility of explaining biologi- cal phenomena in terms of the laws of physics and chemistry, laws that do not depend upon teleologi- ca! concepts. But the molecular biologist, unlike the organic chemist, will always have to ask about the functions of natural phenomena, and thus he will always have to look for teleological explanations. This explains a recent public lecture by Kornberg (1987), a chemist at Stanford University. Asserting that all biological phenomena should be explained by the laws of chemistry, he complained that since molecular biologists have rejected this reductionist premise, "chemistry and biology are two distinctive cultures," each having its own language. Rosenberg (1985) has provided a good example of this. DNA is composed of four different molecules: adenine, quanine, cytosine, and thymine. RNA is also constructed out of four bases, which include adenine, quanine, and cytosine. But the fourth base for RNA is uracil. Why does DNA contain thymine, whereas RNA contains uracil? The organic chemist can explain all the chemical reactions involved. But the molecular biologist must assign functions to the phenomena. The biologist wants to know what thymine does for the proper functioning of DNA that uracil cannot do. The chemist is satisfied if he can explain the chemical causes of the difference be- tween DNA and RNA. But the biologist wants to explain the purpose of this difference. In chemistry causes explain their effects; in biology effects ex- plain their causes. The biologist asks why there is a difference between DNA and RNA. In the chemist's view of the matter, it is not there for any further reason whatsoever, or at any rate it is no business of chemistry to find a further cause not already mentioned in the complex causal chain of chemical interactions it has eluci- dated. So far as chemical theory is concerned, if all samples of DNA contain thymine and all samples of RNA contain uracil then this is an entirely accidental fact about the universe. For biology, it is very far from mere happenstance. (Rosenberg, 1985:41-42) The pattern of organic bases in DNA and RNA which functions as a genetic code cannot be re- duced to physics and chemistry. In its control of morphogenesis, DNA acts like an engineer design- ing a machine for some purpose. Like an engineer, DNA harnesses the laws of inanimate nature to serve goals that are themselves irreducible to those laws (Polanyi, 1959:41-70; 1968). Thus the latest research in molecular biology confirms Aristotle's insight that we cannot fully explain living beings unless we find their final and formal causes as well as their efficient and material causes. This is even more clearly true in the practice of medicine. It is not enough for Sacks to explain Tourette's syndrome as an effect of certain biochem- ical reactions. He must recognize it as a failure of the brain to achieve its natural end. He must under- stand how the proper amount of dopamine promotes the normal functioning of the brain. In his writings Sacks insists that the neurologist must consider not only the physical mechanism of the brain but also the psychic identity inseparably tied to that mecha- nism. He recognizes Ray's suffering not only as a physical effect but also as a psychic failure to achieve a healthy balance in his soul. But even if we accept Aristotle's teaching that biological nature has ends or purposes, we might still resist his assumption that these natural ends are moral ends. Should we see morality as a cultural product that transcends the laws of nature? Are Nature's Laws Moral? T. H. Huxley (1898:79-83), in his famous Romanes lecture of 1893, "Evolution and Ethics," concluded that evolution could not guide ethics at all since</page><page sequence="13">185 "the cosmic process has no sort of relation to moral ends": "the thief and the murderer follow nature just as much as the philanthropist." He suggested, therefore, "that the ethical progress of society de- pends, not on imitating the cosmic process, still less in running away from it, but in combating it," the goal being "to set man to subdue nature to his higher ends." While Aristotle would see ethics as somehow the fulfillment of human nature, Huxley would see ethics as the assertion of human will against nature. Is it not absurd to say that the cosmic process produces a being that must combat the cosmic process to survive? If moral ends have "no sort of relation" to the cosmic process, then do they come from beyond the cosmos? If Huxley's "cosmic pro- cess" is not the source of everything in the cosmos, then must we not wonder whether his understanding of this process is defective? Huxley's assumption that the cosmos is purely mechanistic and therefore has no relation to moral ends forces him to accept a radical Kantian dualism. This dualism is incoherent because, if the moral world has no relation at all to the natural world, then it is inexplicable how these two worlds could even occupy the same universe. Do we not judge the goodness of a person's life by how well he or she has fulfilled the essential ends of human nature? Do not moral principles commonly presuppose some conception of what is essential to human nature? In response to Huxley, we might say that the thief and the murderer do not follow nature just as much as the philanthropist. Prohibiting unjus- tified killing and protecting property are not just arbitrary human choices. Rather they secure certain natural human needs as suggested by the fact that murder and theft are universally prohibited in every culture (Davitt, 1978; Finnis, 1980; Linton, 1952, 1954; Lopreato, 1984; Murdock, 1945). One of the clearest of Aristotle's examples of a natural moral law grounded in our biological nature is parental care for the young (GA 753a7-17). Among some animals this attachment may last only until birth. But among the more intelligent animals the attachment endures until the young have matured. And those endowed with the greatest intelligence exhibit "intimacy and friendship" (sunetheia kai philia) with their offspring even after their full devel- opment. Of course, how parents care for their chil- dren will vary from one family to another and from one culture to another, but the familial bond as a natural inclination is universal despite the variation in its practical expressions. (On the natural need of infants for paternal love to fulfill their biological potentialities, see Spitz, 1965; Kagan, 1981; and Goodall, 1986:101-4, 203-6, 376-86, 568-69.) We do not have to take one side or the other in the "nature-nurture" debate. Aristotle supports the com- monsense view that moral character is both natural and cultural. The biological nature of human beings constitutes the necessary condition for that distinc- tive dignity of human beings as moral agents. But although this is a necessary condition, it is not sufficient. This biological capacity is fulfilled through cultural habituation. This is the teaching of Aris- totle's Nicomachean Ethics (1103a24-27): "The vir- tues arise in us neither by nature nor contrary to nature; but by nature we can receive them and perfect them by habituation. Again, of things which come to us by nature, we first bring along the powers and later exhibit the corresponding activi- ties." Human nature is malleable to the extent that it is open to formation through habituation, yet human nature is fixed insofar as human beings have certain natural tendencies or capacities from birth. But if biomedicai technology gives us the power to alter the genetic nature of human beings, does that create the possibility of human nature becoming completely malleable? Would our moral choices about the use of this technology be unconstrained by any fixed natural standard? That conclusion has been drawn by Blank (1984:10-12) in his recent book on the political implications of reproductive technol- ogy. The character of human nature has been a philosophic question for thousands of years. But the question has become more complicated in recent years, Blank argues, because now we can change the very nature of the human species. We can no longer assume, as Aristotle did, a fixed human nature. But I would point out that the latest reproductive technology as described by Blank (1984:31-71) is guided by a distinction between what is normal and what is defective in human development. In speak- ing of how genetic technology can be used to diagnose and treat genetic "defects," "disorders," "deformities," and "diseases," Blank implicitly ap- peals to our common sense (and Aristotelian) under- standing of healthy human development, which pre- supposes a fixed human nature. When an infant is born with a genetic disorder that will create perma- nent mental retardation, we can argue about whether the doctor or the parents did enough to prevent this from happening. But we would never argue about whether or not medical knowledge should be used to create mental retardation. If human nature is no longer fixed, if there are no natural norms for human development, then some parents might properly prefer to produce mentally retarded children. (Of course they would probably scorn the word "retarded" as reflecting a merely subjective value judgment favoring a complex men- tal capacity.) Parents might prefer such children because of their docility. And these children might make good workers for certain types of menial jobs.</page><page sequence="14">186 After all, A. Huxley's Brave New World shows us how a rational eugenics policy could arrange things so that people would be suited from birth for their various places in society, and thus all would be happy. We dismiss this as absurd because we recognize the worth of full mental development as a fixed end of human nature. We sense the truth of Aristotle's claim that we are by nature the sort of beings for whom to live means to think. Therefore, Blank's reliance on "informed consent" and "the prevailing values of society" is insufficient in the absence of any appeal to such a natural norm of what it means to be a human being. After all, doesn't even the worth of "informed consent" depend upon the natural human capacity for moral choice? We can see a natural norm at work in Sacks' practice. He reports cases of severely retarded people who display a dignity in the very simplicity of their immediate perception of the world (Sacks, 1985:163-223). Nevertheless, he recognizes this as a response to a genuine loss: the intensification of sense experience compensates for a defect in the capacity for abstract thought. We cannot imagine that Sacks would ever use his scientific knowledge to create mental retardation. Nor can we imagine him using his understanding of Tourette's syndrome to promote that condition. He accepts Ray's deci- sion to alternate between five days on haldol and two days off, but only because this seems the only way to approximate artificially the natural balance experienced by normal human beings. He would not choose to induce the effects of Tourette's syndrome in normal people who wanted to improve their performance as jazz musicians. But if we must appeal to the moral dignity of human beings as a natural fact, we must wonder whether we are justi- fied in our implicit claim that human beings stand at the peak of nature. Is there any support for this in biological science? Has Nature Created Humans to be Its Noblest Creature? In one of the most famous passages of the Politics (1253a8-19), Aristotle declares that human beings are by nature the only political animals because they are by nature the only truly rational animals as manifested in their unique capacity for rational speech. Some other animals can with their voices signify to one another their sensations of pleasure and pain, but only human beings can through sym- bolic speech share with one another their concepts of expediency, justice, and goodness. Human be- ings can achieve a more intimate community among themselves than is possible for other creatures, because only human beings can found their associa- tion on mutual understanding through speech. Like many of the fundamental assumptions of Aristotle's moral and political writings, this one is grounded upon his biological studies (see, for example, HA 488a7-10, PA 653a27-31, 656a3-14, 686a24-87b25; GA 731a24-31b13, 786b20-26). And the latest biolog- ical research supports his claim that human beings are uniquely endowed biologically with a capacity for human language (Lieberman, 1984). Can this assertion of the biological uniqueness and superiority of the human species be defended against Darwin's argument (1874:445-528) that hu- man beings differ in degree but not in kind from other animals? Darwin offers evidence that every attribute traditionally thought to be uniquely human can be found in at least some rudimentary form in other animals. Yet I think almost all of Darwin's evidence was known to Aristotle. Like Darwin, Aris- totle was aware of the remarkable similarities be- tween human beings and other animals, but he correctly saw that only human beings are capable of symbolic speech and conceptual abstraction. Some other animals can express their sensations through signs, but only human beings can understand and use symbols. Other animals are capable of percep- tual thought, but only human beings are capable of conceptual thought. I will not lay out here all the evidence and arguments for these distinctions (see Arnhart, 1984:506-15, 1987a:57-60, 220-25). But I can offer one illustrative comparison of Aristotle and Darwin on the issue of animal communication. To show that the capacity for speech is not uniquely human, Darwin draws attention to the singing of birds (1874:462-63). The sounds uttered by birds offer in several respects the nearest analogy to language, for all the members of the same species utter the same instinctive cries expressive of their emotions; and all the kinds which sing, exert their power instinctively; but the actual song, and even the call-notes, are learnt from their parents or foster parents. These sounds, as Daines Barrington has proved, "are no more innate than language is in man." The first attempts to sing "may be compared to the imperfect endeavor in a child to babble." ... Nestlings which have learnt the song of a distinct species, as with the canary-birds edu- cated in the Tyrol, teach and transmit their new song to their offspring. The slight natural differ- ences of song in the same species inhabiting different districts may be oppositely compared, as Barrington remarks, "to provincial dialects"; and the songs of allied, though distinct species may be compared with the languages of distinct races of man. I have given the foregoing details to show that an instinctive tendency to acquire an art is not peculiar to man. Just as human beings can acquire a language as a cultural product, so it seems that birds can learn songs and pass on this learning as a cultural</page><page sequence="15">187 tradition. The latest research confirms Darwin's re- ports (Baker and Cunningham, 1985; Catchpole, 1986; Gould and Marler, 1987). Aristotle distinguishes between "sound" (psophos), "voice" (phone), and "language" (di- alectos) (HA 504b1-3, 535a28-36b24, 597b26-29, 608a10-17; PA 660a35-60b3). Voice is a sound pro- duced by an animal using imagination to signify something (semantikos) (DA 420b6-21a7). Many ani- mals, therefore, can use their voices to express their emotions or otherwise convey information through signaling. But only human beings have a capacity for language as articulate speech. Birds, however, Aristotle notices, do have something like articulate speech. They use their voices not only for mating and fighting but also for teaching and learning. Some birds teach their young to sing, and conse- quently the singing differs according to locality. Aristotle's comments suggest that he would agree with Darwin and other biologists who argue that some animals other than man have at least a rudimentary capacity for communication and cultural learning (Bonner, 1980). But Aristotle would say that this falls short of the uniquely human ability for "rational speech" (logos) (GA 786b20-26). This must be uniquely human because it manifests the "intel- lect" (nous) that only human beings possess. Through the intellect human beings have a capacity for conceptual abstraction that transcends the ca- pacity that other animals have for perceptual ab- straction. For example, we could train a chimpanzee to respond to a triangle as a perceptual sign (per- haps as a sign for food). But we could never train him to comprehend the Pythagorean theorem be- cause that would require understanding the triangle as an abstract concept. At an even lower level of mathematics, we could say that although other animals have some crude number sense, human beings are the only animals who can count (Ifrah, 1985:3-30). In Plato's Republic (521b-26b), the guardians begin their education with the study of arithmetic. Is this because in counting we move from concrete plurality to abstract number and thus expe- rience our first glimpse of the Ideas? Insofar as we are the only animals capable of intellectual judgment, we are also the only animals capable of moral and political judgment, in which we judge conceptual patterns of action. The proponents of "animal rights" would object to this claim that we are the only animals with the dignity of moral agents. But the mere fact that the lower animals are incapa- ble of grasping or expressing the moral arguments made by the human beings who speak for them is evidence of their inferior status. Of course even if we deny that nonhuman animals have rights, we might still be obligated to respect them by avoiding any unnecessary cruelty. Aristotle places humans at the top of the ladder of souls (DA 413a4-16b32, 427a16-29a9, 431 b20- 35b26; PA 641 a15-41 b10, 650b19-23; GA 731 a24- 31b14, 736a25-37a35). At the lower level is the nutritive soul of plants. The nutritive functions? principally nourishment and reproduction?harness the laws of inanimate nature to sustain the simplest forms of life. At a higher level is the sensitive soul of animals, which encompasses functions such as lo- comotion, sensation, imagination, and appetite. The highest level is reserved for the human's intellective soul. (For modern defenses of such a hierarchy, see Polanyi, 1968; Lorenz, 1966:220-40.) Aristotle believes that this ranking of levels is not an arbitrary judgment but a discovery of a natural fact. Each higher level depends upon the functions at all the lower levels, but the higher levels are indeed higher in the sense of being more compre- hensive than the lower levels. A human's perfection as an intellectual being lies in being a microcosm of the whole. "The soul is in a way all things, for all existing things are either sensible or knowable" (DA 431 b19). The Darwinian biologist might object, however, that Aristotle's image of a ladder of being moving from "lower" to "higher" forms of life implies a cosmic teleology that Darwin rejected. The Darwin- ian view is well stated by Gould (1977:62): i(Homo sapiens is not the foreordained product of a ladder that was reaching toward our exalted estate from the start. We are merely the surviving branch of a once luxuriant bush." Mayr (1983b) and other evolu- tionary biologists would agree. In defense of Aris- totle, I would argue that his biological teleology is not cosmic?that is to say, he does not assume that nature as a whole has some end beyond the ends of the various species. For Aristotle a teleological explanation claims that something is "better thus? not simply but with reference to the substance of each kind of thing" (PH 198b8-9). His teleology applies to the goal-directed functioning of each species of living things. It is not a cosmic teleology because nonliving things are not explained teleologi- cally and living things are not explained as serving any universal goal. (On this point I agree with the argument of Nussbaum, 1978:93-99.) Aristotle's tele- ological account of the forms and functions of existing species does not depend upon a teleologi- cal account of the origin of species, because the existence of species is taken for granted. Nor does his teleological biology require a teleological physics (Masters, 1986). Darwinian evolution denies phylogenetic teleol- ogy, because there is no predetermined path of evolution from ancestral species to later ones. But the Darwinian biologist would still affirm the ontoge- netic teleology (or teleonomy) in the goal-directed</page><page sequence="16">188 activity of an individual organism as guided by its genetic program (Dobzhansky et al., 1977:497-504; Mayr, 1976, 1982:48-51; Arnhart, 1984:498-500). It can be argued that "the only 'teleology' Darwin criticized was that represented in creationist ideas of special divine providence," and therefore his biology does not deny "the empirical teleology of self-organizing beings" (Cornell, 1986:420). Aristotle speaks of the ranking of species with the human species at the top. And in the Politics (1256b15-26) he says that plants exist for the sake of animals and nonhuman animals for the sake of humans. How can this be reconciled with his appar- ent denial of a cosmic teleology? It should be noted first that this is also a problem in interpreting Darwin. Although in his notebooks and in some correspondence Darwin insisted that we should never speak of "lower" and "higher" forms of life, in his published writings he often ranked species and spoke of humans as standing at the peak. There is no contradiction, however, if we assume that both Darwin and Aristotle were speaking of "lower" and "higher" in terms of specific criteria such as levels of complexity and from their perspective as human beings. Even if we see the human species not as the highest step of a ladder but as one branch of a bush, we can still look at the living world from the perspective of human life and judge other forms of life for their closeness to us. From the vantage point of the human species, the vegetative life of nutrition and growth and the animal life of perception are incomplete. For human beings to pursue the end of their species, they must seek the comprehensive human life that includes the ends of plants and other animals but also the ends that only human beings can attain. Thus, the end internal to the life of the human species must be more comprehensive?and in that sense higher?than the ends of plants and other animals. And that which is unique to human beings and thus the highest end is the capacity for intellectual thought. In the De Anima Aristotle insists that, as a princi- ple of life, thinking is as inseparably bound to the body as form is to matter, and thus it is open to biological investigation. But in a few cryptic passages (e.g., DA 430a17-23; GA 736a24-37a18), he suggests that "active intellect" might be separa- ble from the body and thus beyond the biological realm. I will not try to clear up this matter except to quote the following comments by Grene (1963:244) on why Aristotle might have considered thought as somehow separable from the body. Perhaps it springs from the biologists sense that his own knowledge, his own elaboration of sets of propositions and arguments about other living things, is a very strange addition to life itself, so strange that it must have a foreign source, an origin all its own.... Perhaps then, Aristotle's nous is... a concept necessary to guard the knowledge of life against the collapse into mere life. Thinking is a form of living. But living as such is successful or unsuccessful, not true or false. This is one aspect, in fact, of Plato's argument in the Theaetetus: what he is arguing is that on this basis knowledge is not possible at all. For Aristotle's reader the relationship between the brain and the mind remains a mystery. That this continues to be a controversial issue for modern scientists suggests that they have not solved the mystery. (Compare, for example, Eccles, 1979:210- 37; Stent, 1987; and Churchland, 1986:315-47.) The Darwinian biologist might want to insist, however, that even the human mind, along with all the other products of evolution, was ultimately de- signed to be a tool of survival. But Aristotle would argue that nature promotes not just life but also a good life. The tongue illustrates how nature secures both the necessary conditions for living and the purposeful conditions for living well (DA 420b17-23). Insofar as the tongue helps an animal to taste, it is necessary for life. Insofar as it is a tool for articulate speech, the tongue is an aid to the good life. The same sort of duality can be seen in the teeth (GA 788b2-9). Similarly, the brain "is present in animals for the preservation of the whole body" (PA 652b7). And Aristotle goes on to explain how the brain contributes some of the conditions necessary for survival. That the brain promotes physical survival does not detract from the brain's capacity for thought as a noble end in itself. And with respect to evolution, we could say that what originates for the purpose of physical preservation and reproduction can have uses that go beyond preservation and reproduction. Darwin used his brain to formulate and defend the theory of evolution. Since evolution is a cosmic principle, the consistent evolutionist must affirm the capacity of the human mind for grasping the truth about the cosmos. Such a capacity presup- poses that the mind transcends the brain in that the mind harnesses neurophysiological mechanisms without being determined by them. Thus the human comprehension of the truth of Darwinian evolution shows that "the soul is in a way all things." "Man is the only animal that stands upright," Aristotle de- clares, "because his nature and essence is divine, and the work of that which is most divine is to think and to judge" (PA 686a27-29). Similarly, Darwin (1874:920) observes that the "lowly origin" of humans need not detract from the nobility of their "god-like intellect," which places them at "the very summit of the organic scale." To assume that the human mind can grasp the truth about reality is to assume a metaphysical realism. And although Aristotle would accept that as</page><page sequence="17">189 a fundamental presupposition, there is some evi- dence that Darwin would hesitate. In a letter in which Darwin described his gradual move from religious belief to agnosticism ([1892] 1958:66), he remarked: "But then arises the doubt?can the mind of man, which has, as I fully believe, been developed from a mind as low as that possessed by the lowest animals, be trusted when it draws such grand conclusions?" The same question, however, could be raised about the human mind when it draws "grand conclusions" about the truth of evolutionary theory, or of any scientific theory for that matter. A Darwinian endorsement of metaphysical scepticism would become self-defeating in its nihilistic denial of scientific knowledge. This is evident in Ruse's recent book, Taking Darwin Seriously (1986). According to Ruse, Darwin- ian biology, in both epistemology and ethics, sup- ports the metaphysical scepticism of David Hume. Both the rules of thought and the rules of morality have evolved as innate dispositions only because they serve biological ends, and not because they are objectively true or necessary. Although Wilson has endorsed Ruse's argument (Ruse and Wilson, 1986), it would seem disastrous for modern biology to turn Darwinism into a sceptical assault on reason and morality. If taking Darwin seriously means rec- ognizing the truth and worth of what Darwin teaches, then we cannot take him seriously if he teaches us that we have no power to see the truth or worth of anything. We cannot take Darwin seriously if we have no reason with which to take anything seriously. Moreover, we cannot dismiss this threat of nihilist scepticism arising from modern science as a purely theoretical issue for academic debate. We now confront this as a practical, political issue because of recent developments in biomedicai technology. If we think about abortion, amniocentesis, in vitro fertilization, surrogate parenting, and all the tools of genetic engineering, we face political controversies in which we are forced, in Wilson's words, "to decide how human we wish to remain." Some commentators, such as Leon Kass and Willard Gaylin, would suggest that we must appeal to some conception of the moral dignity of human beings within the order of nature, which assumes an Aristotelian understanding of human nature. But Engelhardt's Foundations of Bioethics (1986), one of the most impressive philosophic treatises on bioethics, rests on the premise that modern science has refuted Aristotelian teleology. Even Engelhardt, however, cannot defend his "secular pluralist moral- ity" without covertly assuming the very teleology that he professes to deny. Bioethics for Nihilists Engelhardt accepts Nietzsche's teaching that mod- ern science promotes nihilism. Science must do this because it deprives us of any appeal to human nature as a guide for morality. For we must admit "that we are shaped not by design but by the blind forces of mutation and natural selection" (Engel- hardt, 1986:375). We then see that no conception of what is good for human beings is rationally justifi- able. So in a modern liberal society, which permits diverse ways of life to flourish, we can never expect rational agreement about the best way of life. How then can we live together in peace? What do we do, for example, when we cannot agree about whether parents should be free to use all the tools of genetic technology to determine the nature of their progeny? Engelhardt (1986:33) seeks a middle ground "be- tween a dictatorial imposition of a particular view of the good life and a nihilist apathy that abandons all vision of the good." He finds that ground in the idea of a "secular pluralist society" as founded on a "developed habit of the will to respect the freedom of others... to attempt to achieve their good," for which the cardinal virtues will be "tolerance, liberal- ity, and prudence" (1986:382). Although we cannot agree on the particular content of the good life, we can agree on a general procedure of toleration as the necessary condition for the peaceful exercise of moral freedom. Why must we agree on toleration as a moral virtue even when we disagree about the substantive con- tent of morality? Engelhardt's answer?inspired by Kant?is that if we wish to engage in moral activity at all, we must respect one another's moral choices because "the very conditions of morality are grounded in our character as persons" (1986:64). "Secular pluralist morality" rests on "a transcenden- tal mooring: persons as the center and source of meaning" (1986:376). Yet if we cannot appeal to human nature as a source of norms, then how can we appeal to the nature of human beings as per- sons? Human beings are said to deserve special respect because of their capacity for moral agency. But that would seem to infer a moral norm from a natural fact about human beings. Engelhardt (1986:5-6, 166) denies the validity of Aristotelian teleology but he must implicitly assume such a teleology when he speaks of the biological conditions of moral personality. The "biological char- acteristics" of human beings as a unique species "take on moral significance only insofar as they support the special characteristics of persons" (1986:107). So, for example, his "higher-brain-cen- ters definition of death" rests on his claim that "if the cerebrum is dead, the person is dead" (1986:211). And since human fetuses and infants do not have the cerebral capacity necessary for per-</page><page sequence="18">190 sonhood, they do not have the moral standing of normal human adults (1986:216-17). Human beings have moral dignity, it would seem, only insofar as they fulfill their natural end as rational animals. But at the same time Engelhardt insists that such teleo- logical reasoning is improper. Engelhardt recognizes that doctors implicitly make a normative judgment whenever they speak of a disease, deformity, or disability. Yet since he denies that such a judgment can be grounded in nature, he regards it as arbitrary. He concludes from this that in a "secular pluralist society," people should be free to reject medical judgments about what is health and what is disease. This would permit a "democratization of reality" (Engelhardt, 1986:194). But if language is an arbitrary human creation with no fixed correspondence to nature, as Engelhardt claims, then it would seem that his talk about the moral freedom of "persons" only manifests his purely subjective preferences. In adopting metaphysical scepticism, he deprives him- self of any ground for speaking coherently about ethics or anything else. The practical consequences of Engelhardt's scep- ticism become clear when he comments on the prospects for genetic engineering. He foresees? and endorses?the possibility that we could so radically alter our nature that our descendants would become a new species (Engelhardt, 1986:377). To exercise such a power might seem to threaten the freedom of those new human beings who would be created by the engineers. Engelhardt (1986:376) denies this, however, by indicating that in changing our nature as humans, our nature as persons would remain fixed! There is a distance between us as persons and us as humans. This distance is the gulf between a reflective and manipulative being and the ob- ject of its reflection and manipulation. From our perspectives as persons with particular views and hopes, we can decide whether this is the best of places in the cosmos.... We can decide whether this is the best of natures and seek ways to refashion it if we find it wanting. We as persons can make our bodies objects. We can discern ways in which we could have been better fashioned. But if we were to so radically alter ourselves "as humans" that we become a new species, wouldn't that also influence our existence "as persons"? Moreover, if we are completely free in our "reflec- tive and manipulative" power, could we turn that power against itself? If human nature as it now exists is not normative, what's wrong with abolish- ing our nature as persons? If we must be free to choose to live as we please, why may we not freely choose to obliterate our capacity for free choice? It seems that Engelhardt would have no objections to the society depicted in Huxley's Brave New World, in which people were taught to love their servitude to a bureaucracy overseeing projects in genetic engineering. Conclusion Wilson's "two great spiritual dilemmas"?the appar- ent lack of transcendent meaning for human life and the terrifying power of modern science to reshape humanity?force us to choose between nihilist scep- ticism and Aristotelian teleology. To choose nihilism would be moral and intellectual suicide. When peo- ple like Wilson, Ruse, and Engelhardt deny that morality and knowledge can ever have any objective grounding in reality, they deny the rationality of all human thought and action, including their own. But in practice we are all Aristotelians in our commonsense belief that we can know what reality is like and act accordingly. From that standpoint, we can identify human beings as creatures with distinc- tive capacities, and we can see that human life flourishes only insofar as those human capacities are fulfilled. We can therefore admire the medical prac- tice of someone like Sacks, who helps people overcome those disabilities of body and mind that impede the human striving for a normal life. The nihilist would regard such a view of the world as a comforting illusion that is required for human life. But, in fact, this commonsense understanding of things is as defensible in theory as it is necessary in practice. For we have seen that the objections to Aristotle's teleological conception of nature are mis- taken. Darwinian evolution and other advances in modern biology need not weaken our confidence that we can guide our lives by reflecting on nature. Darwinian biologists have increased our under- standing of all living beings, including ourselves. And, most recently, molecular biologists have given us a knowledge of the genetic code of life that improves our control of biological reproduction and growth. In addition to this, the biological study of behavior offers new insights to social scientists. Consequently, modern biologists have forced us to reconsider old questions about the meaning of human life within the cosmic order. It is good that we should once again ponder those old questions in the light of this new knowledge. We should resist, however, the common but foolish pretension that our new science will give us an unprecedented insight into the essence of life. For it is more likely that the early excitement over new discoveries will be fol- lowed by a chastened respect for the recurrent patterns of life: birth and death, the growth of plants and animals to maturity, sexuality, family life, and the mystery of humans as the only animals who yearn to make sense of it all. We will thus be led</page><page sequence="19">191 back to the experience of the ancient Greek philoso- phers who looked to nature as an object of wonder. Note 1.

Bluhm Political Science University of Rochester Rochester, New York 14627 In a time of nihilism, power determines political purpose?the power of a passion or of a pressure group. The American political community is suffering from nihilism. It is manifest in the erosion of our moral tradition and in the reduction of our political system to a weakly umpired struggle of interest groups for control of public policy. More frequently than not, policy represents simply the lowest com- mon denominator of group demands, a compromise among the passions. The incipient erosion of civil liberties in the face of the long-term decay of the tradition signals the approach of the master passion. Larry Arnhart has done yeoman service in calling our attention to the merits of Aristotle's natural teleology. It is a teleology that is biological in foundation and method; it is also capable of ordering our moral lives, as individuals and as a community. Arnhart offers it as a moral capstone to the incisive empiricism of contemporary sociobiology. Arnhart has shown that medicine cannot do with- out teleological judgments about what a normal human life requires. This is conclusively demon- strated in his discussion of Oliver Sacks' clinical experience in treating Tourette's syndrome. Sacks' patient, Ray, after experiencing the frenzied reflexes produced by the disease and the dull and plodding character of life induced by the medicine haldol, decided that happiness was to be found in a condition that included both states, and that this was the normal or natural human condition. Ray's decision to allow the disease to have free play on weekends and to take haldol during the work week, which allowed him to alternate between the two states at will, was the closest he could come to achieving this normalcy. The normal or natural here appears as a psychic state that is grounded in certain biological conditions. The natural human condition is therefore a satisfying state of mind that is produced by the normally functioning soma. Does Arnhart also show that the good ethical and political life are similarly grounded in normal biologi- cal functioning? He makes good progress with such a showing, but then turns his argument around and threatens to destroy what he has so carefully built. Let us see what he has done, and then suggest a correction of the argument. At the end of his consid- eration of the Tourette's syndrome case, Arnhart compares Sacks' judgment about natural psychic balance to Aristotle's discussion of the virtues in the Nicomachean Ethics. He asks, "And doesn't that idea of natural balance conform to what Aristotle would call a natural mean between excess and defect?" The comparison is a good one, for in each case we have a rational judgment about goodness, and in each case also the achievement of goodness corresponds to a satisfying condition of life. In treating Tourette's syndrome, rational manipulation of the soma produces a balance. In the ethical life, rational habituation of the soul produces a balance. Arnhart uses this comparison as a point of depar- ture for a discussion of ethical and political teleol- ogy, and of the relationship between reason and biology in those spheres. He shows that Aristotelian method requires that we reflect on our biological natures. And in doing so "we see that all human</page><page sequence="21">193 beings seek happiness or the fulfillment of their desires." But we disagree about what is desirable. Our reflection then leads us to recognize that the unique element in human nature leads us beyond the biological realm to reason. And we become aware that "the capacity for purposeful conduct guided by rational deliberation is uniquely human." Human happiness therefore consists in the active exercise of reason in prioritizing and realizing our values. At this point, Arnhart goes on to show how reason surveys the catalog of human needs in the context of deciding the values at which the human political community aims. He moves from economic and sexual need to friendship and the desire for bond- ing. In doing this he treats moral action as a kind of "animal movement," for it works with biological drives. But this is a movement that is completed by rational judgment. And his discussion of judgment leads into a brief consideration of rational habitua- tion and prudence. He then goes on to compare Aristotle with the sociobiologists and shows that the latter's frame of reference does not go beyond reproduction and survival, but that Aristotle's in- cludes patterns of habituation and cultural learning. Aristotle's anthropology thus transcends biology as it adds reasoning and culture to the list of natural human propensities. But Arnhart shows that teleol- ogy does not turn into theology. Aristotle does not personify nature as a rational artist with a cosmic design, but only as a set of tendencies that are biological in foundation. Nor does he assume that nature as a whole has an end beyond those of particular species. Also, in human life as in an animal's, Aristotle insists on a radical dependency of final and formal causes on material and efficient ones. Thus, if physical condition and process are poor, rational ends or purposes will not be realized. In this way rational and biological teleology are kept in tandem with each other. Arnhart also wishes to argue that Aristotle's im- age of a ladder being moved from "lower" to "higher" forms of life does not imply a cosmic teleology that would sever hierarchical order from biology. He does this by pointing out that Aristotle, like Darwin, employed specific criteria for differenti- ating species. And his designation of reason as the uniquely human function permits us to drop the problematical "higher" and "lower" schema in favor of viewing forms of life in relation to completeness. Looked at this way, human life is uniquely complete, for it includes the ends of plants and other animals and also transcends them. This is accomplished through the intellective principle, which is peculiarly human. Now at this point Arnhart turns his argument against itself. For in exploring the idea of intellection in this section, he emphasizes its separateness from the biological. This calls in question the rest of the essay, which stresses the radical dependence of the intellectual on the biological. Can we save the argument? Arnhart writes that "in a few cryptic passages [in Parts of Animals, Aristotle] suggests that 'active intellect' might be separable from the body and thus beyond the biological realm." And then he quotes an explanatory comment by Grene (1963), who writes that "Aristotle's nous is a concept necessary to guard the knowledge of life against the collapse into mere life." If thinking were only a form of living, knowledge would not be "possible at all." He goes on to say that Darwin's idea of evolution implies a similar transcendent capacity, without which it could not be grasped as a cosmic principle of order. But this kind of argument does not support Arnhart's thesis that Aristotle's teleology is biologi- cal in foundation. It maintains that in order to defend the concept of evolution, Darwin himself would have to sever the link between reason and biology. This is an interesting thesis, but it does not belong in the essay we are examining. Nor does it express Aris- totle's complete thought on the matter of mind and body. Let us try to place it in context. Arnhart notes that in speaking of cognition or intellection in Parts of Animals, Aristotle tells us that this capacity embodies what is "most divine" in us, and that human "nature and essence is divine." This fits with the idea of the separateness of mind from body. But Aristotle elsewhere (Nichomachean Eth- ics) distinguishes that form of reason which is divine from that which is human. The reason that is charac- teristically human is practical reason (phronesis), which Arnhart had mentioned in an earlier part of his article. And this is a reason that functions for the purpose of doing, not for the accumulation of knowl- edge for its own sake. For most people, knowing, in the form of speculative philosophy or science, is superhuman. Aristotle (1177b26-1178a17) writes: But [the philosophic life] would be too high for man; for it is not in so far as he is a man that he will live so, but in so far as something divine is present in him.... But in a secondary degree the life in accordance with the other kind of virtue is happy; for the activities in accordance with this befit our human estate. Just and brave acts, and other virtuous acts, we do in relation to each other.... and all of these seem to be typically human. Some of them seem even to arise from the body, and virtue of character to be in many ways bound up with the passions. Practical wisdom, too, is lik- ened to virtue of character, and this to practical wisdom.</page><page sequence="22">194 Here Aristotle conceives the typically human as involving community life and politics. The disem- bodied thought of the lone philosopher does not presuppose political community. It is autonomous. In some sense, this may be the highest form of life. But when Aristotle thinks of human beings in their most characteristic form, he thinks of them as political animals. And as political animals, it is practical wisdom (phronesis) that is the work of reason. Practical reason is intimately tied to community life and to the soma. In contrast to scientific knowledge, practical rea- son is not abstractive, rule-bound, or generalizing. Its first principles "are variable." "Practical wis- dom. .. is concerned with things human and things about which it is possible to deliberate." "The man who is without qualification good at deliberating is the man who is capable of aiming in accordance with calculation at the best for man of things attainable by action." Practical wisdom is only mini- mally concerned with universals. Above all it must grasp particulars, "for it is practical, and practice is concerned with particulars." Practical reason deals "with ultimates, i.e., particulars" (Nicomachean Eth- /cs 1140a24-1140b30, 1141b8-23, 1143a25-35). The human being who fulfills his or her nature as human (i.e., as political) according to Aristotle will be one who sees ethical choice as fundamentally situation-bound. The prudent person has a feeling for what is required to be done under particular circumstances. And this is a sense that develops through experience of acting. Knowing in this sphere is for the sake of doing, and emerges only through doing. It is an ingrained way of being and acting, not an abstracted contemplative knowing. Thus conceived, it is more an aspect of living than of knowing. It would not, however, be correct to say that in practical wisdom knowing is collapsed into mere living. It rather consists in the best or highest mode of living. It is a transformation of biological mechanism into moral habit. Arnhart's argument is thus saved by recognizing that human reason as such, the reason that is necessary to the political animal, is phronesis, not nous. It is not only Aristotle's teleology, but also his prudential ethics that has a special message for Americans. In contrast to this ethics, the systems that are most popular today are abstractive, rule- bound, and procrustean. They also do not work. I am referring to the prevalence of utilitarianism and of Kantian deontological ethics today, systems of thought which represent the two major strands of American culture?our hedonistic individualism and our moral egalitarianism. These are schools of thought that dominate the literature of ethics and public policy today, and which, when applied to policy issues, leave us with dilemmas rather than resolutions. Applied to the same issues of distribu- tive justice they yield opposite results. Aristotelian ethics treat every moral issue within its own special terms of reference. We have something here akin to situationism and pragmatism, in its focus on the particular. Yet unlike both these approaches, Aristo- telian ethics operates against a backdrop of general principles. It is interesting that in modern political thought, recourse to the law of nature as the law of reason by writers such as Hobbes and Locke, in order to provide a safeguard against the frustration of values that are not given by a teleological nature but rather by irrational passion, fails to work. For these writers treat the law of nature simply as a maximizing calculus that is wholly intellective. This is because their conception of reason is modelled on a distorted version of disembodied nous, not on phronesis. Hobbes and Locke are able to specify the principles of action for a person of enlightened interest, but they are unable to furnish a principle for incorporat- ing the "precepts of reason" in human action in the crucial part of society. Both show how these precepts may be instilled by leaders (either by "Leviathan" or a bourgeois social elite) in the social majority, but neither has a way of inculcating them in the few. And it is not self-evident that elites are by nature persons of enlightened self-interest. History shows that, for the most part, they have not been so. Neither writer can fall back on a teleology of human nature in which psycho-social tendencies move us to our ends, tendencies which reason completes. By nature the only thing given for them is irrational passion or desire. (Following the interpretation of Cox, I read the anthropology of Locke as fundamen- tally Hobbesian. The second chapter of the Second Treatise, in which the state of nature appears gov- erned by a law of nature, I take to be a surface argument intended to make contact with the Scho- lastic tradition. In chapter nine, Locke identifies the state of nature with the state of war. [See Cox, 1960 and Bluhm et al., 1980].) Thus, without a teleology of natural values, and without phronesis, calculating reason fails to supply a solution to the problem of ordering the drives in the thought of contractarian liberalism. Its optimistic rationalism is ill-prepared for the onslaught of the master passion that completes our nihilism. Kantianism, as another major form of modern ethics, also has large problems. It is abstracted from the empirical realities of life in its noumenal tran- scendence. Despite the fact that Kant restores to modern thought a dual concept of reason, his practi-</page><page sequence="23">195 cal reason is not like that of Aristotle. It is not a capstone to a natural teleology of ends embodied in psychosomatic tendency. Rather, it stands outside the phenomenal world as a purely abstract principle of universalizability. The natural order of ends is closed to its sight. Our sense of duty is supposed to respond to the Categorical Imperative of Reason, but duty finds no support in the tendencies of our nature, which are purely passionate and disordered. It consists in disembodied moral will, the only thing that Kant considered irreducibly good. But how, in its atemporality, can duty cope with the temporal demands of passion? And how can its abstract test of universalizability fit the needs of multiform circum- stance? Nietzsche well understood the vulnerability of Kantian ethics to the Dionysian movement of life. In restoring Aristotle's natural teleology, Arnhart has given us a remedy for many of the problems of modern thought. But we should take it as a remedy for our ills, not as a substitute for modernity. Aris- totle's thought lacks an appreciation of individual freedom. We cannot allow the givenness of his teleology to exclude our freedom?freedom to follow new and unexplored paths of being human. But we should allow it to mark for us the boundaries of the major highway from which our innovating paths depart and to which they return. History and Biological Teleology John Bokina Department of Political Science Pan American University Edinburg, Texas 78539 Arnhart's timely and provocative article attempts to resolve the value crisis of the modern biological and sociobiological sciences by reconciling these sci- ences with Aristotle's biological teleology. The idea that modern biology, like modern science in general, will engender a value crisis is hardly new. By engaging in ostensibly objective, quantitative, value- free inquiry into the character of human and non- human organic life, scientific biology strips these forms of life of their traditional values. Biological science itself has failed to generate a new set of qualitative values to replace the discredited notions of myth, religion, and philosophy. This value nihilism has become particularly ominous in the contempo- rary period as military, ecological, and biomedicai developments undermine our traditional assump- tions about the character of organic life?and in- deed may threaten the existence of that organic life. Perhaps it is an inevitable twist in the history of ideas that Aristotle's biological teleology, the b?te noire of modern biological science, should be of- fered as a possible source for a new biological value system. Arnhart contends that Aristotle's biological teleology?i.e., the notion that species have their own ends and purposes?is both compatible with the most up-to-date biological research and can serve as a source for qualitative biological values. By adopting a teleological perspective, the ends and purposes of species not only describe essential elements of these species, but also prescribe an inherent, biological foundation for value judgments about them. Arnhart's resurrection of Aristotle's biological tele- ology is no mere revanchist reaction against scien- tific modernism. Arnhart does not advocate the discarding of any credible biological or sociobiologi- cal research in order to accommodate science with the new-old teleological value system. Unlike crea- tionism, biological teleology does not impose an a priori dogma upon scientific facts. Rather Arnhart argues that a teleological reconceptualization of biological and sociobiological research will reveal a heretofore hidden and much needed set of biologi- cal values. But if Arnhart's attempt to accommodate fully the findings of modern scientific research is the most ambitious and exciting part of his project, it is also</page><page sequence="24">196 its greatest weakness. In order to reconcile Aristotle with modern biology, I will contend that Arnhart offers an extremely positivistic conception of biologi- cal teleology. This positivistic conception empties teleology of its dynamic and transcendent aspects. Moreover, his ahistorical treatment of Aristotle gives his proposed synthesis an abstract and arbitrary character. Static, one-dimensional, and devoid of real historical content, Arnhart's appropriation of Aristotle merely lends a teleological rhetoric to a substantively unchanged biology and sociobiology. The value crisis remains unresolved. Arnhart offers three arguments which close, or at least minimize, the differences between Aristotle's biological teleology and modern biology. The first and most important is that the empirical findings of the two biologies are not as divergent and irreconcil- able as the protagonists of modern biology have claimed. In this regard, Arnhart emphasizes the empirical character of Aristotle's taxonomy and em- bryology, and defends the empirical plausibility, if not the empirical accuracy, of Aristotle's failure to account for biological evolution. Despite the impor- tance of this argument to Arnhart's position, an evaluation of his assertions about modern biological research is beyond my competence. This aspect will no doubt be covered by other commentators. But I will briefly comment on the remaining two argu- ments, which raise matters of scientific principles rather than scientific findings. In his second argument for the compatibility of biological teleology and modern biology, Arnhart notes the persistence in everyday speech of teleo- logical assumptions about human and nonhuman life. Whether we affirm, deny, or ignore biological teleology in principle, a practical teleology is ines- capable. According to Arnhart, "in practice we are all Aristotelians in our commonsense belief that we can know what reality is like and act accordingly. From that standpoint, we can identify human beings as creatures with distinctive capacities, and we can see that human life flourishes only insofar as those human capacities are fulfilled." Arnhart does not explore the philology of this or other references to "common sense" or "common practice." Nor does he acknowledge the vast epistemologica! gulf which separates common sense and common practice from most conceptions of science and philosophy. Here he rather hopes to invoke the naive sympathies of the reader in support of a very sophisticated and complex argument. If everyday speech confirms the inevitability of biological teleology, so too does medical practice. In his third argument, Arnhart maintains that the dis- tinctiveness and moral worth of human life are not only assumed by common sense and common prac- tice, but that these same beliefs are indispensible to medical practice as well. For Arnhart, medical prac- tice as applied science constitutes the middle and mediating factor between pure science and com- mon practice. In his insightful analysis of a case study from Sacks' neurological practice, Arnhart shows how a teleological understanding of the uniqueness and dignity of human life forms the underlying basis for diagnosis and treatment. By implication, this same implicit teleology of human life underlies most medical, psychological, and psy- chiatric treatment. Arnhart's interpretation of the hidden teleology of medical practice is suggestive, but hardly above reproach. Even if we grant that medical practice is applied science, we must also note the very different objectives of medical practice and biological sci- ence. Medical practice is aimed at therapeutic suc- cess; therapeutic success may or may not be based upon an accurate and up-to-date scientific under- standing of human biology. Arnhart's discovery of a latent teleology in medical practice may be, there- fore, only an uncovering of the pre- or non-scientific assumptions of this practice. In his attempt to breach the gap between Aristotle's biological teleol- ogy and modern biology, Arnhart conflates theory and therapy. More importantly, Arnhart's turn to common sense and medical practice as confirmations of a persis- tent and perhaps inevitable teleology may be self- defeating. It is very unlikely that either common sense or medical practice can contribute to Arnhart's ultimate goal: the resolution of the value crisis in modern biology. A modern value system requires both a firm grounding in reality, as well as a transcendental standpoint for judging that reality. In principle, an appropriately conceived biological tele- ology could satisfy both of these requirements. By identifying biological teleology with common sense and medical practice, however, Arnhart successfully grounds this teleology within human reality, while he simultaneously sacrifices the necessary transcen- dental standpoint. There are two possibilities for a biological value system validated by common sense and medical practice. On the one hand, there can be a revival of the familiar idealist hypostatization of the real as the ideal, i.e., that which exists is as it should be. When the teleological ends and purposes of species are defined by common sense and medical practice, these ends and purposes are inherently conserva- tive. The biological status quo is endowed with normative significance. The dynamic aspect of Aris- totle's teleology?the sense in which every determi- nate being is not understood "as a separate meta- physical entity but as the process or movement through which every particular being molds itself into what it really is" (Marcuse, 1963:40)?is lost in</page><page sequence="25">197 this static accommodation of the individual and species with socially defined notions of normalcy or health. In Arnhart's conception, teleology is nothing more than a new biological functionalism. There is no transcendent standpoint that would allow one to judge currently existing reality as deficient; the possibility that species, particularly the human spe- cies, have heretofore realized only some of their potentialities is foreclosed by defining the telos of species in the terms of currently existing common sense and medical practice. The other possible outcome of the attempt to ground teleological values in common sense and medical practice is a renewed, and indeed reinvigo- rated, value skepticism. If biological teleology is nothing more than a patina of normative value superimposed upon the status quo, biological sci- ence will once again treat this value dimension as extraneous to its task of understanding organic life. Earlier I suggested that an appropriately con- ceived teleology could resolve the value crisis of modern biology. Here, as briefly as possible, I would like to suggest the origin of Arnhart's inappropriate conception, and propose the broad outlines of a more satisfactory model. In his desire to make Aristotle's biological teleol- ogy acceptable to modern science, Arnhart divorces this teleology from its place within Aristotle's meta- physical system. By this divorce, Arnhart eliminates the most speculative aspects of biological teleology, while he also explains away Aristotle's embarassing views on women and slaves. The problem is that by eliminating the speculative and metaphysical as- pects of Aristotle's biological teleology Arnhart also reduces its effectiveness as a foundation for a biological value system. I will confine my remarks to the implications of Arnhart's non-metaphysical bio- logical teleology for the evaluation of human life. Arnhart notes Aristotle's well-known definition of human being as a rational, communicating, and therefore political animal. From this definition it follows, teleologically, that the good is what enables this human being to flourish according to its own nature, and that the bad is what precludes or obstructs this flourishing. If biological teleology is kept within the parameters of Aristotle's metaphys- ics, then a teleological spectrum of human life results. At the pinnacle of the species are those relatively few human beings who realize their ratio- nal nature to the highest degree, i.e., they contem- plate the divine idea of the essential order of the universe. Beneath this intellectual elite is a much larger number of people who are capable of a rational and relatively fulfilling life of practical activ- ity. And beneath these classical prototypes of the bourgeoisie are the women and slaves who require the direction of the higher types in order to achieve a measure of reason and productivity. Despite its superficial resemblance to Plato's doctrine, Aristotle does not rigidly divide human beings into three discrete classes. Rather, from Aristotle's teleological perspective, there is only a single telos of human nature, defined by reason, speech, and political activity. But this telos exhibits different degrees of realization in different individuals. Arnhart's non-metaphysical interpretation of bio- logical teleology cuts off the extremes of Aristotle's human spectrum. The notion that contemplation of the divine idea represents the culmination of human being as a biological being has been viewed as scientifically indefensible. Arnhart takes great pains to excise this metaphysical-theological dimension from his interpretation of biological teleology. Simi- larly, save for exceptional individual cases, Arnhart denies the notion of undergroups of women and slaves who cannot fulfill their natures through their own efforts. In a plausible but not completely con- vincing piece of textual exegesis, Arnhart notes the contradiction between Aristotle's infamous views on women and slaves on the one hand, and his other references to the essential unity and dignity of all human life on the other hand. In light of the contro- versial, rightist character of some contemporary sociobiological theory, Arnhart's careful cleansing of the elitist and sexist aspects of Aristotle's biological teleology is perfectly understandable. But, alas, in terms of the original meaning and intent of these ideas, it is far more likely that it is Aristotle's views on the unity and dignity of human life which are the untenable contradictions within his fundamentally hierarchical and sexist philosophic system (Keuls, 1985; Wood and Wood, 1978). Devoid of a metaphysical dimension and stripped of its sexist-elitist prejudices, what is left of Aris- totle's teleology that can serve as a foundation for a modern biological value system? Not much. As was the case with his common sense and medical practice arguments for teleology, here we once again see the latent status quo conservatism?and potential nihilism?of Arnhart's conception of biolog- ical teleology. Arnhart's biological teleology is la- tently conservative because it proclaims the teleo- logical goodness of a vast and undifferentiated, somewhat rational, communicative, and political population. Only exceptional individuals subject to exceptional conditions are temporarily or perma- nently excluded from full membership in this biologi- cal vision of the all-encompassing, liberal-capitalist middle class. While Arnhart successfully avoids the charges of sexism and elitism, he also precludes the possibility that contemporary individual and social human life is not all that it should be, that individu- ally and collectively we may be capable of higher, more fulfilling, more peaceful modes of existence. But in Arnhart's present conception of biological</page><page sequence="26">198 teleology, the value of human life is measured in conformity with the status quo. If this is the only possible foundation for a biological-teleological value system, then doubts about this Panglossian view of modern life may only induce a new round of normative skepticism?and a return to the value nihilism that biological teleology was supposed to rectify. The alternative to Arnhart's conception of biologi- cal teleology is not just a better interpretation of Aristotle's texts. I have tried to argue that Arnhart's interpretation of Aristotle is not so much wrong as it is unsuitable to his goal of solving the modern value crisis. Indeed, rather than substituting my version of Aristotle for Arnhart's, it seems to me that there is something thoroughly anachronistic about attempt- ing to resolve the value crisis of the twentieth- century biological sciences by any interpretation of texts from the fourth century B.C. There is a concep- tion of biological teleology which could resolve the modern value crisis, but this is a biological teleology that is as contemporary as the biology that it complements. In order to extract the still valid kernel of truth from Aristotle's biological teleology, we must come to a full understanding of the historical foundation of his philosophy. The essential contradiction to the lofty achievements of classical Greek philosophy is its material foundation in a society characterized by limited material resources and slavery (Marcuse, 1963:42). This material foundation constrains Aris- totle's conception of the teleology of human life. First, human fulfillment is limited to the abstract life of the mind. Second, this abstract fulfillment is restricted to the elite few. And third, the abstract fulfillment of the elite few is predicated upon the bondage of women and slaves. Under more favor- able material conditions, the Aristotelian notion of the teleology of human life takes on a far less restrictive appearance. In this less restrictive, fully modern form, biological teleology can provide the basis for a new, biologically grounded value system. The first stage in this revision is Hegel's reinter- pretation of Aristotle's metaphysics. For Hegel, the process of teleologically unfolding or becoming is an essentially historical process. Beings, particularly human beings, fulfill their essential natures during the course of historical development. Hegel thus reinterprets Aristotle's dynamic but ahistorical tele- ology as a process of temporal becoming. Neverthe- less, despite the passage of more than two thou- sand years since Aristotle, Hegel's conception still bears the scars of material scarcity. True fulfillment still takes place in the mind; although Hegel abjures the classical elite-slave distinction in his belief in the essential dignity and equality of all people, this essential dignity and equality are in practice con- fined to the spiritual realms of philosophical princi- pies and abstract declarations of constitutional ide- als. Essential dignity and equality were belied by daily life in a class society. But Hegel's grounding of teleology in history does set the stage for a truly modern understanding of biology as the foundation for normative values. The decisive step in the modernization of teleol- ogy lies in Marx's critique of Hegel. In light of the possible conquest of material scarcity by industrial production, Marx released the teleology of human life from its historical fetters. Fulfillment is no longer restricted to the life of the mind, but is now the full development of all human senses. Furthermore, the fulfillment of some is no longer predicated upon the bondage of others. This notion of the full biological- sensual development of the human species is not confined to Marx's early philosophical writings. The biological rhetoric of these early works is often dismissed as merely a residue of romantic nature philosophy. Rather, a biological conception of hu- man life persists in Marx's later, ostensibly eco- nomic works. These works resemble Aristotle's bio- logical teleology in their refusal to acknowledge a rigid distinction between biology and history, be- tween nature and nurture. In these works, the eco- nomic activities which characterize human social life are understood as the activities of a natural-histori- cal species in a constant and intimate "metabolic" relationship with its natural environment (Breuer, 1986-87; Schmidt, 1971). In the most Utopian formulations of some of Marx's successors, the full development of human species life becomes the precondition of the eman- cipation of non-human nature from its most brutal and irrational aspects. Grounded in material pros- perity, the old teleological dream of fulfilled human life as the apex of organic life loses its metaphysical- religious character and becomes a real possibility of real human existence (Feenberg, 1981:251-52; Mar- cuse, 1969:7-48; 1972:59-78). In the reinterpretation of Marx and his successors, teleology is a viable foundation for a new biological value system. The telos of human and non-human species are not measured by the conformity of these species to the commonsensical, medical, or func- tionalist conceptions of the status quo. Rather bio- logical teleology is understood as a process of biological-historical development, wherein value judgments are based upon the extent to which species realize the fulfillment and pacification made possible by a post-scarcity economy. In this under- standing of biological teleology, a full array of value judgments is possible, including the very necessary judgment that the human species has heretofore failed to realize its telos.</page><page sequence="27">199 On the Relevance of Aristotle's Bioethics John F. Cornell St. John 's College Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501 There is a reasonable urgency today about clarifying the relationship between biology and human affairs. A growing genetic technology is an obvious reason for concern. But behind that is the real crisis, at once ethical and educational. The "moral" teach- ings that descend from the new schools of biology ?of which sociobiology may be considered repre- sentative?are easy deductions from rigid reduction- ist theories, requiring no inquiry about the limits of theory, and thus ready for popular consumption. Arnhart clearly recognizes the philosophical dimen- sions of our situation in his article "Aristotle's Bio- politics". His suggestion that we begin our re- thinking of bioethics with serious study of one of the greatest biologists and ethical thinkers seems to me a timely one. Modern scientific methods engender ceaseless advances and ceaseless controversies, but they appear impotent to give us, as Aristotle did, a reasonable view of our own species' place and purpose. In my response to Arnhart's article I shall sketch a few general arguments supporting his detailed de- fense of Aristotle against sociobiologists. I shall argue: (1) that the whole pursuit of a single, univer- sal mechanism of evolution falsifies the phenomena, as Aristotle's comparative method does not; (2) that the evolutionist preoccupation also entails a crucial distortion of the relation between technology and nature, which we can see in Darwin; and (3) that since such philosophical errors accompany our theo- retical and technological advances, the claim of modern biology to supercede Aristotle's understand- ing of the human animal is indeed invalid. The problem with the post-Darwinian schools of biology, especially their inability to discern the dis- tinguishing marks of humankind, may be traced to their underestimation of the comparative method, which was primary for Aristotle (and indeed for natural history until the nineteenth century). Modern science demands, on moot metaphysical grounds, that truths be articulated as universal laws; modern biology fills this demand when it treats all living things as a class, as it does in theorizing about species origins. Hence the sociobiological emphasis on genetic survival, regarding other motives and aspirations of human beings as less genuine phe- nomena. Aristotle enunciated universal principles but never in the reductionist sense, because he saw that origins do not tell the whole story about natural things. His observation (De Anima 415b), for exam- ple, that the desire of all plants and animals to leave offspring represents the universal striving to imitate divine permanence captures the higher as well as the lower meaning of the phenomenon: it leaves open what kind of immortality?biological, artistic, political?a being might pursue. Contemporary biologists suppose that "human nature" must be understood by a general mecha- nism of origins, not by a phenomenological investi- gation of what distinguishes the human species, because they believe that an evolutionary mecha- nism?the struggle of populations to survive?"un- derlies" the very appearance of species distinctions. They fail to see, however, that making distinctions about modes of life cannot be relegated to such subordinate status. Nothing in the concept of mere survival dictates what particular manifold of things should come to be and survive. That which things do in common hardly tells us the real reasons for their differences. Ultimately one must grant to the living realm some intrinsic power of differentiation? as Darwin did with the idea of variation?a creative power independent of the necessitarian principle of survival. Even such a principle is only a substitute for knowledge, representing the unfolding of potenti- alities for life which we would not have guessed by acknowledging merely the condition of survival, potentialities which we realize only as we come to distinguish the forms that exist. Human reason is one of these unforseeable poten- tialities that has survived?that we can say for sure. But I would not agree with Darwinians, as Arnhart does, that the human mind may have originated for the purpose of physical preservation, and then say that mind goes beyond its origin and takes on its own purpose. This way of putting it practically accepts the biologists' pretension to know the es- sence of intelligence through a reductionist account of its origin, when in fact they have only ascertained an obvious condition of life, self-preservation. Or, to put it another way: how an organic feature may be used at some time does not necessarily reveal its entire character. Darwin recognized this in some measure. He often spoke with special reserve about the deeper origins of vital, instinctual, and mental powers, recognizing a limit to his explanation that his followers overlook. But such a limit goes for all origins-theorizing: particular living forms do not pre- sent themselves as thoroughly predictable in- stances of any general rule; we cannot logically</page><page sequence="28">200 remove the comparison of actual phenomena from first rank in biological inquiry. Aristotle's rejection of origins-theorizing as the main road to biology and his concentration on the present appearance of things were no historical accident. Still, it would be a worthwhile study to see whether Aristotle could point us to a more profound kind of evolutionary thinking. In De Anima, for in- stance, besides a scientific presentation of the kinds of soul and their respective ranks, there are tanta- lizing suggestions that one power "grows" out of a lower one in which it must be implicit. Plant nutrition, for example, involves a sort of logos (416a16), an ability to synthesize and to develop as a balanced whole, an ability which fully blossoms in human reason. Looking from the plant's standpoint, so to speak, through the reverse end of the microscope, the lowest powers of life may well be illuminated by the existence of the higher. In any case, the modern reduction of all living beings to one evolutionary mechanism, neglecting comparison as a way of coming to know them first, dictates an unsatisfactory view of the relation be- tween human technical power and nature. This only becomes evident once we consider more closely Darwin's and Aristotle's differing positions on art and nature. As Arnhart points out, both Darwin and Aristotle rely on some artistic "metaphor" to enter into the workings of nature, but I would resist Arnhart's suggestion that both these great natural- ists understood nature to be imitating art. Imitation of art by nature seems an untenable formulation of the relation between art and nature, yet it is a formulation closer to Darwin's attitude than to Aris- totle's. Aristotle clearly puts the relation of art and nature the reasonable way, with nature as the standard for art, when he proposes the heuristic of the four causes. "If art imitates nature (ei de e techne mimeitai ten physin)%\ he says (Physics II, 194a22), then we should attend to both the forming and the material principles. He justifies reference to human handicraft to approach the essential biological prob- lem of growth by observing how the processes of art and natural generation overlap. If a house were a thing generated not by human beings but by nature, he notes in chapter 8 of Book II of Physics, it would be generated, in a way, like art. But of course "houses" are also generated by nature, as his discussion proceeds to remind us: he refers to the swallow's nest, the spider's web, and, charmingly, the plant's production of leaves to shelter its fruit (199a12-31). Human building, animal building, and even growth?self-building?are not absolutely dif- ferentiated teleological activities. All "arts" (of other organisms as well as the human species) are under- stood within the sphere of an organism's pursuit of its nature. This means that human arts must be subordinated to some natural internal goal. The first chapters of the Ethics indeed make clear that the arts serve the attainment of the good life for human beings, their naturally highest potential. By contrast, Darwin's analogy of the human agri- cultural breeder and nature, which he used to argue natural selection, ultimately distorts our comprehen- sion of both nature and technique. It distorts our comprehension of nature because, in using the external controls of the breeder as a model, it presumes external forces on organisms to be the deepest causes of biological diversity and change. Moreover, by virtually equating the human art of breeding to nature's mode of producing species, it removes the art from any natural bounds. Human art is not conceived as comparable to activities of other life-forms: in this respect the great evolutionist stresses our kinship with other organisms far less than Aristotle does. Indeed, Darwinians have conve- niently disregarded the fact that Darwin's analogical account of nature had a biblical, i.e., not-scientific, inspiration: he assumed human creative power to be analogous to that of a transcendent creator and even alluded to a Cosmic Breeder in early versions of his theory. (For detailed exposition, see Cornell, 1984 and 1987.) The Darwinian position thus distorts our perspective on technique no less than on nature. For if human power to change organisms is in effect analogous to God's, that power is "above" nature; it need not recognize any natural good or goal to which it should conform. Darwinism is more a projec- tion of technique onto nature than a natural philoso- phy and hence cannot orient human beings and their artful powers. It is no wonder that it should underwrite an "ethical" program that can give us no genuine guidance. Darwinism, to use Arnhart's phrase, is biological nihilism. We should not fool ourselves by thinking that Aristotle's biological teachings are deficient for lack- ing evolutionary sophistication or acquaintance with manipulative techniques. We should rather wonder if his vision of living things was not clearer without these distracting special concerns. Aristotle's idea of the human animal as the one with reason really results from such profound vision, and we may draw out, along with Arnhart, the implications of that idea. Aristotle implies, I think, that a rational animal has a high destiny in the scheme of things, superior (but not incomparable) to that of any other animal. Some further consideration of Aristotle's meaning should reveal the depth of his doctrine about human beings compared to those emphasizing the human species' past evolution and future engineering. Recall that Aristotle perceives a logos even in the plant, and remember also the role of reason in his analysis of animal movement, to which Arnhart</page><page sequence="29">201 nicely draws our attention. Aristotle understands animal motion as the image of a reasoned syllogism pursuing a desired good. Notice that in whatever way we might imagine an animal to evolve, its activities must still embody this structure of a rea- son-like orientation toward the benefit of its life and kind. This definition of animal activity, in other words, transcends species evolution. Now we should also notice how Aristotle's view of animal motion echoes his definition of human beings as reasoning about the good. It is as if the most general power of organisms to seek their own interest has become intensified in the rational animal. Can we imagine that the general idea of animal activity must remain constant through evolutionary change but that its more conscious instantiation in human rea- son should be impermanent? Does it make sense that reason, the principle of our well-being, should ever be supplanted by reasoning for our well-being? In other words, once a rational animal always a rational animal? Reflection on these questions seems only to con- firm Aristotle's view that rational activity is indeed nature's highest end, a natural ideal to be surpassed not even by the most elaborate technological power. To see this, we might extend Arnhart's argument for natural teleology?based on the way actual medi- cine seeks to restore healthy activity of body and mind?to encompass a possible, technologically unrestricted "medicine." Suppose we sought, using biomedicai technology, to "repair" any defect or frailty that figure of speech calls human. Presumably bio-engineers direct their efforts toward some hu- man "improvement," some good. They would have to reason, then, about how the extravagant use of biotechnology should promote this end. Without a natural good at which to aim, how would their efforts not follow merely arbitrary desires? Indeed, with only technical possibilities to guide them?inherently un- limited technical possibilities?there could be no reason for ever finally being satisfied. The pursuit of any life-enhancing technology, without a notion of the natural good life, must easily turn into compul- sive behavior, much like the pursuit of non-medicinal drugs, which also promise a higher happiness. One must ultimately acknowledge that unless one fo- cuses on some natural end-in-itself, something like the inward development of reason which (as Aris- totle knew) requires only limited external exertions, one has not reasoned successfully about the good of the human species. Arnhart is right to recommend Aristotle's rational ideal of the human species in his argument against biological nihilism. Today especially, to deny such a self-ideal may be the necessary first step toward self an-nihil-ation. Reductionist beliefs like sociobiology, blind to rationality as our natural end, offer little restraint on the vain expansion of desire and power through technique. Without some doctrine of the natural good of human life (like that which traditional medicine acknowledges) to which all scientific researches might subordinate themselves, they can only be more easily subordinated to the sub-rational forces of international commerce and warfare. If science today does not undertake, as an integral part of its inquiry into nature, serious and sustained reflection about the human good, science cannot escape the charge of serving inhumane ends. Scien- tists' good will is not good enough: the way to the self-destruction of the human species might well be the belief of some that its condition can be radically improved. What aspiring scientists need at the end of the twentieth century is what Aristotle offered students of his own day, not a technological illusion, but a philosophical education.</page><page sequence="30">202 Biological Nihilism and Modern Moral and Political Theory H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr. Center for Ethics, Medicine, and Public Issues Baylor College of Medicine Houston, Texas 77030 As Arnhart acknowledges, the major intellectual challenge of the 20th century is to justify moral judgments rationally and to provide moral authority for political action when individuals meet as moral strangers who do not share common moral assump- tions. This is the task of a secular morality that aspires to transcend particular religious or ideologi- cal commitments. The arguments for nihilism sug- gest that such a task cannot be successfully com- pleted. There are three ways one might attempt to escape the threat of nihilism. First, one might en- deavor to show that the Aristotelian project to read human moral goals and the lineaments of proper political structure from the characteristics of human biology can be successful, despite the skepticism of authors who have articulated the naturalistic fallacy: from what is the case, one cannot conclude what ought to be the case. A neo-Aristotelian approach would need to derive from the biological nature of humans a proper code for human conduct and morally justified guidelines for human political ac- tion. Second, one might attempt to discover, as Kant had hoped, content in the very nature of reason. Here the "nature" at stake is not an external biologi- cal nature, but the characteristics of reason or reasoning itself. A contemporary example of the Kantian undertaking is found in Rawls' Theory of Justice (1971). The Aristotelian and Kantian tradi- tions provide two quite different senses of "natural," from which Western thinkers have attempted (in different ways) to establish the content of natural law and to justify moral and political rules. Both of these approaches have their difficulties, as Arnhart acknowledges. The neo-Aristotelian ap- proach, appropriately modified by neo-Darwinian qualifications, must show why the particular design of the human body at this time in human evolution is normative. Why, for example, should one accept the various decrements and changes in function tied to human aging? Why should the particular givens of evolution be morally constraining beyond being mat- ters one should prudently take into consideration? If the neo-Aristotelian answers that what is at stake are not the mere particularities of the human biologi- cal form, but rather the characteristics of a rational animal, then the neo-Aristotelian begins to depart from Thomistic Aristotelianism with its natural law arguments against contraception and moves toward the position of the Kantians. One attempts to derive what is normative for humans from the character of rationality, not from the character of human biology. But then one encounters new difficulties. How can one derive from reason itself the proper ranking of such important moral and political desiderata as prosperity, liberty, and equality? Different rankings of the goals will justify radically different moral and political systems. If one cannot read off the answer from external nature, then one must appeal to a canonical moral sense. But which canonical moral sense ought one to endorse? To answer the ques- tion, one will have to appeal to a higher level moral sense, and so on, ad indefinitum. Nor will it do to appeal to consequences, because one must weight the significance of the consequences, and such weighting also presupposes a canonical ranking of crucial moral desiderata. It is because of these difficulties that nihilism seems triumphant. If one turns outward to human biological nature, one cannot read off from what is what ought to be. If one turns inward to the charac- ter of reason itself, one will discover the process of coherent reasoning, but not a set of concrete moral norms. In despair, one might attempt either to rework the insights of Aristotle or Kant, or to address matters afresh. Arnhart goes back to Aristotle to show the coherence between Aristotle's biology and his moral and political theory. To strengthen his arguments, he attempts to show that, after all, those who disagree with Aristotle, such as Kant, Wilson, Ruse, and Engelhardt, presuppose Aristotle's teleol- ogy despite themselves. It is therefore worth underscoring once again why one cannot derive from the character of human biology norms for human conduct and political ac- tion. An evolutionary understanding of human nature leads one to conclude that the current character of human biological structure is the result of inclusive fitness, genetic drift, forces associated with the biological, chemical, and physical structures with which evolution has had to work, and pure chance. Insofar as one can talk of successful evolutionary adaptation, one must identify the reproductive suc- cess of an organism in a particular environment. However, humans often have other goals in mind than reproductive success. Moreover, humans place themselves in new and often alien environments. Therefore, to speak of the successful adaptation of a self-conscious, willful organism such as humans,</page><page sequence="31">203 one must specify not only the environment but the goals one has in mind. It may be the case that in some environments an I.Q. over 70 may be nega- tively correlated with reproductive success, when compared with individuals with an I.Q. of less than 70. If reproductive success is the defining goal for adaptation, then the mentally retarded will in general be better adapted than those who are not retarded. The point is that humans judge the character of their biological structure in terms of the goals they endorse, not goals they find in nature. As a conse- quence, humans may often take great pains to alter what evolution has brought about in order to achieve their own ends. Contraception provides an excellent example. Individuals may decide, in order to achieve their goals, that they will not reproduce, even though their failure to reproduce not only thwarts their own reproductive success, but their inclusive fitness as well, so that they and those with their genes die out. They may even hold that their decisions run counter to biologically based urges to reproduce. The ques- tion for them will be whether such urges, instincts, or proclivities are anything more than factual con- siderations to bear in mind when fashioning rational plans. They may attempt to treat menopause as a disease or eliminate it through genetic engineering, even though it is characteristic of humans and may even have been designed by evolution. They will regard the wide range of human pleomorphism as a menu with items from which to choose for medical treatment and later for elimination or dissemination through genetic engineering. The fact that sickle-cell anemia arose because the heterozygous state is better adapted for environments marked by the presence of falciparum malaria and the absence of adequate treatment (Livingstone, 1964), and that it may stand the human race in good stead during some future decline of civilization, will not provide a sufficient basis for not treating or for not eliminating the al?ele through some future strides in genetic engineering. In addition, particular moral premises must be endorsed. The point is that, Arnhart and Boorse (1977) to the contrary notwithstanding, states of affairs are identified as diseases, not because they are species-atypical or statistically deviant, but because they are associated (1) with the failure to be able to achieve goals chosen as integral to the life of humans, (2) with the presence of unacceptable pain or discomfort, (3) with condi- tions held to be lacking in grace or proper human form, or (4) with death held to be premature?which states of affairs are not immediately under volitional control, which can at least be accounted for by medicine in a way that allows affected individuals to make coherent plans, and which ideally are amena- ble to medical treatment or prevention. One need not assume that individuals or cultures share goals in common, or that one can discover normative goals intrinsic to our biology, just because there is a great deal of cross-cultural agreement with regard to what count as diseases. It will be enough that certain changes in biological structure or mental function will impede the realization of important goals of individuals, whatever those goals might be, in almost any environment one might imagine. The case of Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, which Arnhart cites, is ambiguous because it is not clear whether he is presupposing biologically based norms or a normative notion of rationality. This ambiguity is found in Aristotle's writings. When he comes to talk about political and moral theory, pace Arnhart, Aristotle relies as much on a notion of what it means to be a rational being or a rational animal as he does on his biology. Aristotle has in mind a view of the intellectual life grounded in a notion of a rational being, which notion is not simply a biologi- cal notion, and which notion already incorporates a set of important moral and other values. Thus, when one comes to examine Sacks' case, one finds on the one hand a neo-Aristotelian attempt on the part of the physician to impose a discoverable norm for mental affect. On the other hand, one must note that Gilles de la Tourette syndrome has given Ray a superior adaptation to the environment of the jazz musician, but not to that of his conservative commu- nity. What has not been shown is that one can discover which environment and which goals should be given priority. As with many, if not most, human biological and psychological traits, they come with advantages and disadvantages so that no single definitive judgment can be rendered. A recent exam- ple of this point with respect to medical treatment is provided by the discussions regarding the proper classification of homosexuality (Spitzer, 1987). One cannot simply read off from biology what one ought to do and what one ought to treat. Nor does Arnhart flesh in the relationship between the example he endorses and Aristotle's normative views regarding what it is to be a rational animal. If what I have sketched up to now is the case, the neo-Aristotelian project could not succeed. Canoni- cal moral guidance cannot be derived from the characteristics of human biology in the absence of prior assumptions. Nor is it clear how one can derive content for the moral life from rationality itself. However, as I have argued (Engelhardt, 1987), there is still a way out. One can show what is involved in peaceably resolving a moral controversy. If one is interested in peaceably resolving moral controver- sies, then one must acknowledge mutual respect as a cardinal moral constraint. To draw on Nozick (1974:30-34), one acknowledges freedom as a side constraint, not as a value. If one is not interested in peaceably resolving moral controversies, then one cannot object to being the subject of punative and coercive force. Which is to say, one can sketch out</page><page sequence="32">204 the minimal grammar of moral discourse so that one can still maintain moral language after nihilism. The argument has a kinship with Kantian transcendental arguments. It points out a major rational practice that is inescapable and that has a certain circularity, so that those who reject or try to escape it become subject to it. The result is that one can establish the centrality of peaceable negotiation without valuing it or asserting that one ought to undertake it. One cannot even establish what ought to be the conclu- sion of such moral negotiation. But one finds at the end of this reflection a justification of much of the moral and political processes characterizing our contemporary reaction to nihilism. Free and in- formed consent is endorsed not because of respect for the dignity of individuals, but because it is the only process through which one may peaceably establish common moral grounds for moral strang- ers. Democracy is endorsed not because of liberal commitments, but because consent becomes the only source of moral authority when concrete canons for proper action cannot be read off from the charac- teristics of human biology or derived from the char- acter of rationality. In the face of nihilism, one settles for domesti- cated forms of moral reasoning. It cannot be shown how individuals ought to act sub specie aetemitatis. But it can be shown, if they are interested in resolving issues peaceably, what is entailed by that practice. It can also be shown that those who reject that practice can no longer coherently make moral claims that have a generally justified moral purchase on those with whom they do not share concrete moral assumptions. One can do all of this without assuming the dignity of persons. One need only speak of the requirement of mutual respect as integral to peaceably resolving moral controversies where no answer can be discovered. Persons be- come important as a category of being, not because the only known instances of persons are humans, but because only persons can conceive of moral controversies, participate in them, and resolve them. In this fashion, one can move to justify the general structure of morality as a social practice, which is always present as a possibility for persons, and the rejection of which involves the rejection of a major domain of meaning. It will be up to biologists (perhaps, especially socio-biologists) to account for the genesis of morality and up to psychologists, sociologists, and public policy planners to show how to motivate people to act morally. The actual content of morality will be influenced by biology, as Aristotle understood, yet within a socio-historical context, as Hegel understood. But the grammar of morality is reducible to neither and represents an unavoidable possibility for resolving controversies over moral obligations, rights, and values. Thus, we need not choose, as Arnhart suggests, between nihilistic skepticism and Aristotelian teleol- ogy. There is a tertium quid, a third alternative, as I have endeavored to show (Engelhardt, 1987). The process of peaceable negotiation allows one to account for the common creation with moral author- ity of moral understandings and political frameworks. One need not appeal to human nature as a source of moral norms, but to what would be needed to resolve moral controversies peaceably, which supplies the minimum of presuppositions required to maintain the possibility of minimal moral distinctions and claims. The analysis of the grammar of morality and its relationship to the grammar of peaceable negotiation does not require holding that human beings deserve special respect. It is simply that one cannot use persons without their consent and maintain a minimal notion of morality in a secular pluralist context. One is not, as Arnhart argues, attempting to derive a moral norm from a natural fact. Nor, in a strict sense, is any claim being made about moral dignity or about a special value that should be attributed to freedom. Nothing in these considerations bars one from peaceably nego- tiating all freedom away. This is, after all, the difference between respecting freedom as a side constraint on actions, and valuing freedom. Nor does this argument establish what would be wrong with abolishing our nature as persons, as long as all those involved consented freely. Apart from appeals to particular preferences or special revelation, there is no definitive general (i.e., not requiring particular moral assumptions) secular argument against mass suicide of the human race. It is simply unlikely that all would agree to such an undertaking. The well-founded presumption that the operation of the mind depends on a particular physio-anatomi- cal structure does not presuppose an Aristotelian teleology. Nothing is claimed about the "goals" of those structures, only that the existence of such a structure is at least a sufficient condition for the presence of mind. Other biological structures may provide sufficient conditions as well. In the future, when we are able genetically to reengineer our biology, insofar as we are interested in continuing to have persons as our successors, we will need to be careful not to engineer away self-consciousness. In the very long run we will very likely be able to make sufficient changes in our biology to make our de- scendants no longer members of the same species that we are now (e.g., no longer able to reproduce fertilely with members of the original human spe- cies) and still have them remain persons. A foundation for ethics and political theory can be established, which does not presuppose an Aristote- lian teleology nor the capacity to derive content from reason. We can derive the lineaments of morality from what is involved in resolving moral controver-</page><page sequence="33">205 sies. If one is interested in peaceably resolving moral controversies, then one can articulate the grammar for such resolutions and show how it sustains the central core of moral language. One cannot show that this grammar descends from the gods or is mandated by human biology. It exists as an intellectual possibility for persons. In terms of this perspective, some absolute moral claims can still be made, at least with regard to finite moral reasoners, of which humans are an instance. Given these qualifications, one can talk coherently about morality with moral strangers, despite the failure of Aristote- lian teleology or of Kantian analysis to discover a normative content for the moral life. One can say in general what is involved in peaceably creating (or accepting) a particular moral perspective. There is something of morality and political theory that sur- vives the challenges of nihilism and relativism, and that something does not require an Aristotelian teleology: It is the grammar of moral negotiation itself that offers the possibility of justifying the moral fabric of a secular pluralist society. Aristotle and the Sociobiologists: An Old Controversy Revived Ernest L. Fortin Department of Theology Boston College Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts 02167 Being neither a biologist nor an expert on biopolitics, it is with considerable reluctance that I venture into the vast and intimidating domain mapped out in Arnhart's learned article. My own knowledge of the field is limited to what an interested observer is likely to have absorbed, admittedly in more or less random fashion, by reading the popular journals and engaging in occasional debate with scientists, some of them sociobiologists. Here as elsewhere, one cannot help being struck by the enormous difficul- ties that the growth of scientific specialization and the revelation of hitherto unsuspected links between disciplines once thought to be relatively indepen- dent of each other have created, not only for the amateur but for scientists themselves. It says some- thing about our present situation that many of the terms employed as a matter of course by Arnhart and others?sociobiology, bioethics, biopolitics, bi- omedics, and the like?are not to be found in any dictionary that is more than ten or fifteen years old. If these new labels suggest anything, it is that the most spectacular developments are the ones that have occurred in the realm of molecular biology, all or most of which could have a direct impact on our individual and collective lives. Being told about the existence of quasars and black holes is one thing; learning that science now has or will soon have the capacity to alter our genetic structure and produce human beings with, say, prehensile tails is quite a different matter. It is also the case that biology has more in common with Aristotelian science than does any other modern science. I have never met a practicing physicist who thinks Aristotle has any- thing of importance to teach us in the realm of physics, whereas there are at least a few biologists who continue to show a lively interest in his work. The reason, I surmise, is that biology, where nature's purposes are very much in evidence, cannot dis- pense as easily as does mathematical physics with the notion of finality, the keystone of Aristotle's philosophy of nature. This alone would justify</page><page sequence="34">206 Arnhart's attempt to reexamine the work of present- day sociobiologists in the light of principles derived from that venerable source. Since Arnhart is not himself a professional biolo- gist, his assessment of contemporary biological theory must of necessity be based either on com- mon principles, i.e., principles that apply to a variety of sciences (those of logic and metaphysics, for example), or on a knowledge of the proper principles and method of biology itself, as distinguished from a thorough knowledge of all that is discussed in that science. Strange as it may sound, one need not be an expert in order to criticize the opinions of experts on any given subject. It suffices that one possess what Aristotle calls paideia, a habitus that falls short of episteme or "science" but by virtue of which one is nonetheless able to determine that the conclu- sions reached by the expert (from whom we may still have a great deal to learn) do not follow of necessity from the premises, or violate the expert's own principles, or are contradicted by more reliable evidence drawn from other quarters. A simple exam- ple will illustrate the point. It is not rare for Darwinian biologists to deny that "animate" and "inanimate" beings are essentially different. Yet the fact that they cannot help using these terms, one of them a simple negation of the other, which it therefore presupposes, is already an indication that the dis- tinction between them retains its meaning even for them. I may not always be in a position to tell whether the minute object under my microscope is a living organism or not, but this is hardly enough to call the validity of the distinction into question in cases where no such doubt exists. Everybody knows from common experience that there is more than a difference of degree between a horse and a stone or between a live horse and a dead one. To deny it would be to entangle oneself in a heap of logical inconsistencies such as the ones pointed out in Arnhart's article. Old King Lear knew whereof he spoke when, grieving over the body of his beloved Cordelia, he says: "She's gone forever. I know when one is dead; She's dead as earth." Since I basically agree with Arnhart's analysis (though not necessar- ily with all of his specific formulations), I shall confine myself to a few cursory remarks about the points on which, as I see it, the argument could be supple- mented, refined, or brought into sharper focus. First of all, since the bulk of the debate turns on the issue of teleology, a more concerted effort might have been made to present in its own terms Aris- totle's case for the existence of finality in nature. Granted, Aristotle takes the principle that nature acts for an end or does nothing in vain to be self- evident in the sense that its truth is not established by a process of inference from known premises. This is as much as to say that one cannot give a fully intelligible account of nature without taking its pur- posefulness into consideration. Anyone who fails to do so indicates by this fact that he or she speaks about nature with as much authority as a blind person might speak about colors (compare Aristotle, Physics, 193a7). To call a principle self-evident, however, is not to imply that it is equally accessible to everybody and needs no further explanation. Indeed, ascertaining its exact meaning can be a fairly arduous task, as anybody who has ever wres- tled with Book II of the Physics knows only too well. If anything, the final cause is the least obvious and hence most easily misunderstood of the four causes in the light of which the natural philosopher con- ducts investigations. Extreme care must thus be taken, lest, by oversimplifying matters, one should leave oneself open to valid criticism. We know that nature works for an end, not because it always succeeds, but because it some- times fails. The occasional birth of a blind child is what tells us that nature "intends" to produce children with eyes that enable them to see. If the outcome of this or any other natural process were invariably the same, it could be attributed to the necessity of matter and there would be no need to look for any other explanatory cause (compare Phys- ics, 198bl7ff). Furthermore, it is not hard to figure out why, in the case just mentioned, one particular result rather than its opposite is intended. We have only to look at the handicap under which blind people labor in order to convince ourselves that blindness is not a desirable state. Nor can it be objected that nature is irrational on the ground that it is wasteful in the extreme, producing millions of sperms, for example, when only one is needed to fertilize the female egg. For this apparent wasteful- ness could be part of a larger pattern designed to insure that the overall end will be attained even under the harshest of conditions. Hunters who use a shotgun instead of a rifle to bag an elusive quarry are not doing anything irrational. They know (and hope!) that most of the pellets will miss the mark; but it is still their intention that at least one of them should hit it. This said, one has to admit that nature is and will always be in large part mysterious, raising all sorts of questions that remind us of the ones with which the proverbial brat is forever embarrassing his or her parents. There are innumerable instances in which, as Arnhart points out, its purpose remains hidden or can only be discovered with great difficulty and there are likewise instances in which it exhibits no purpose at all. This much we know from the fact that nature is capable of all kinds of blunders, that it occasionally produces monsters, or that part of what it accomplishes is attributable to chance rather than to a determinate cause (compare Physics, 199a33ff).</page><page sequence="35">207 The key issue in this regard, and the one about which more information would have been welcome, is that of the fixity of the species. Aristotle was obviously of the opinion that all natural species were eternal and thus never considered the possibility that one might have evolved out of the other. Still, there is no reason to believe that his hylomorphic theory is totally incompatible with some form of evolution, as long as one allows for the influence of equivocal or extraterrestrial causes. If matter is intrinsically ordered to the form and perpetually strives in its own obscure way toward it (Physics, 192a16ff), the emergence of accidental or aberrant species becomes at least conceivable. True enough, the fact of evolution has yet to be established. Darwin, whose Origin of Species went through no fewer than seven different editions, certainly did not establish it, and a hundred years after his death the geological record remains extremely spotty, despite all the efforts that have been made to fill the gaps in it. On the other hand, there is ample evidence to suggest that some species have disappeared. If so, Aristotle himself would have to grant that they are not eternal and hence must have been generated; for, on his own telling, it is only in eternal things that being and possibility coincide. Nor must we think that all of the individual species are necessary to the intelligibility and perfection of the material universe, which require only that it contain within itself a species capable of reason, along with whatever may be needed to guarantee the survival and well-being of such a species. Some refinement of Aristotle's stated position on this matter thus appears to be called for on the basis of his own principles and in the light of the factual information to which we now have access. A further question arises in connection with Arnhart's endeavor to point out the inherent weak- nesses of the theory of evolution as understood by Darwin and his followers. My fear is that his argu- ment, convincing as it may be to anyone who accepts his premises, will not carry much weight with scientists trained exclusively in the methods of modern natural science. It does little good, for instance, to appeal to what Arnhart (not Aristotle) calls common sense if one's interlocutor harbors a deep distrust of all so-called "common sense" no- tions. What is needed is a fuller account of Aris- totle's general method of procedure as outlined in the Physics and the treatise On the Soul, rather than as described in the treatises on the Parts of Animals and the History of Animals, on which Arnhart relies extensively (with good reason). Such an account would have to explain why, for Aristotle, science must proceed from the general to the particular, in what sense its goal is to achieve an ever more precise knowledge of the various species and their properties, and how the confused but determinate knowledge with which the scientist begins grows more distinct, but less certain, as one comes closer to nature in its concreteness. Considerations of this sort could at the same time help lay to rest the fanciful but persistent notion that Aristotle's natural science is vitiated by a crude anthropomorphic fallacy which ascribes to the whole of nature certain phenomena proper to the behavior of human beings. There is no denying that Aris- totle's argument in favor of teleology rests on an analogy between nature and art, but this hardly warrants the charge that Aristotle was guilty of the pananimism or panorganicism with which he is reproached by his adversaries. To be sure, the fact that I would never inquire into nature's purposive- ness were I not the kind of being who acts for a purpose does not prove that all of nature acts for an end, but neither does it prove the opposite. It suggests no more than that the operations of a nature which is intelligible and shares at least extrinsically in reason must of necessity bear some affinity with those of the human mind. Modern scientists, who, by resorting to clever hypotheses, fancy experiments, complex instruments, and sym- bolic constructions of the most sophisticated kind, put so much of themselves into their enterprises, are the ones who lapse into anthropomorphism when they claim to have given us a perfect image of nature. In point of fact, natural beings, into whose definition matter necessarily enters, defy any and all attempts to arrive at a complete knowledge of them. Studying them in minute detail is like building a bridge across a river, the opposite bank of which constantly recedes as one draws nearer to it. One ends up by being much better informed about nature than would otherwise be possible (the bomb did explode!), but without being able to say what the ultimate composition of matter is. Only the most naive of scientists thinks that what his or her conceptual tools grasp is the natural object as it exists in itself. Biologists may know more about carrots than anyone else, but eating a carrot as they define it, if that were possible, would most likely result in a terrible indigestion. My final point concerns Arnhart's remarks to the effect that Aristotle's ethics and politics are grounded in a theoretical understanding of nature. These remarks may come as something of a surprise in view of the fact that, in the Ethics and the Politics, theoretical considerations are kept to a bare mini- mum. The most plausible explanation is that both works were meant to be read by nonphilosophers, for whom such considerations would be of little use. The problem is far from simple, however, if only because questions pertaining to morality have a certain prima facie evidence that questions of a cosmologica! nature frequently lack. One is re- minded in this connection of the famous "Socratic</page><page sequence="36">208 turn," i.e., the turn away from nature and toward human things, which was provoked by Socrates' inability to come to any definite conclusion regard- ing the competing accounts of the cosmos with which he was confronted (compare Xenophon, Mem., 1.1, 10-15). Aristotle was apparently more optimistic about the possibility of a theoretical un- derstanding of nature, but a closer reading of his natural works reveals that he was not unaware of the elusive character of the whole with which the natural philosopher is concerned. I leave it to others to decide whether and to what extent this could affect our understanding of the relationship between the speculative order and the practical order. Arnhart's article begins and ends with a timely reminder that, by depriving us of all objective stan- dards of moral goodness, modern science risks plunging us into a kind of Nietzschean nihilism. The warning, a fashionable one nowadays, reflects the new mood among critics of the contemporary intel- lectual scene. There was a time, not too long ago, when Marxism was thought to be the gravest threat to our way of life. Americans knew nothing of Nietzsche and were wholly unattuned to his brood- ing meditations on the theme of nihilism, with which continental Europeans became obsessed in the aftermath of World War I. Scientific rationalism and democratic freedom were the dominant forces in our society, and it was assumed that, far from pulling us in opposite directions, they supported each other. That situation appears to have changed dramatically in recent years. All signs now point to the fact that the alliance between them is coming apart and that, unless the trend is reversed, we too may soon find ourselves awash in a sea of relativism. Faced with this alarming prospect, some philoso- phers have begun to look to classical political thought for the guidance that we need in practical matters. Arnhart's suggestion, if I understand cor- rectly, is that a similar return to the spirit, if not the actual content, of classical natural philosophy may likewise be in order. Unfortunately, the obstacles in this instance are even more formidable, owing to the fact that Aristotelian physics has been all but totally discredited by the triumph of modern science. Any attempt, however feeble, to provide a natural foun- dation for morality would thus seem to deserve a sympathetic hearing. It is after all remarkable that a number of our leading sociobiologists should sud- denly be taking an interest in such outmoded con- cepts as natural right and natural law?something which, by their own admission, they would not have done ten years ago. My guess is that they are the ones who are most apt to benefit from Arnhart's thoughtful analysis. I, for one, am grateful for that analysis, which has given me a better idea both of where the problems lie and of how one might come to grips with them. Human Nature and Morality: A Sociobiological Perspective Joseph Lopreato Department of Sociology University of Texas Austin, Texas 78712 "The philosophic attitude is a resolute attempt to enlarge the understanding of the scope of applica- tion of every notion which enters into our current thought" (Whitehead, 1938:233-34). There is proba- bly no parallel in the history of thought either to Aristotle's breadth of scholarly attainment or to the historical reach of his intellectual influence. Sociobi- ologists, therefore, can only be enthusiastic about any attempt, such as Arnhart's, to bring such re- sources to bear on their still young endeavors. A guiding beacon, however, often blinds one to the surrounding environment. Aristotle may have been "no less empirical in his biological studies than Darwin," but Darwin, unlike Aristotle, was an evolu- tionist, and discovered the basic mechanism of evolution: natural selection. How can his theory help us to explain aspects of the human condition? That is the challenge for today's students of human behavior, including one who would referee a match between Darwin and Aristotle. Biased judges may despoil contenders of their fair merits. "Failing to show the probability of this theory, Darwin can only show its mere possibility, as though that were sufficient." Darwin did much more. But had he done no more, he would have done quite enough. Would we castigate Copernicus for not being also Galileo, Kepler, Newton? The value of a scientific theory lies not only in its measurable output at the time of its construction but also in the fecundity that arises from it for subsequent genera- tions of scholars. Unfounded aversion necessarily leads to error. Is "the absence of a finely graduated organic chain in the geological record" "one of the most obvious pieces of evidence against" Darwin's theory? It certainly questions that element of the theory that speculated about the tempo of evolution. But macroevolutionists have cautioned against un- derstanding the theory of "punctuated equilibrium" as evidence against Darwin's theory of natural selec- tion (e.g., Stanley, 1981).</page><page sequence="37">209 Nihilism and the Logic of Science Is Aristotle's "biological teleology" "a reasonable alternative to [today's] biological nihilism"? The answer depends in part on whether sociobiology, sometimes apparently equated with evolutionary biology or "modern Darwinian biology," professes nihilism. There are many sorts of nihilism: e.g., "Bazarovian," "European," "Nietzschean," "onto- logical." In Arnhart's view, there appear to be two parts to it, both attributed to sociobiology: (1) "we are just one form of life among many, with no natural end or purpose except to survive and reproduce"; (2) "there is no rationally discoverable standard in nature for guiding human life." Let us briefly discuss these charges, beginning with the first, namely the assertion that, according to sociobiology, our only "natural end" is "to reproduce." Let us start with somewhat of a concession. Shall the truth make us free, as many an academic motto solemnly declares? It depends. It can enslave and kill if, for example, it states, as evolutionary biology does, that there are some natural differences among people, and those who apply such statements have the unhindered power to try to get rid of those differences by hook or by crook. One wonders: Where was the intellectual class of the world when Hitler was playing butcher with millions of our conspecifics and with the theory of natural selection itself? So, a certain resistance to evolutionary behav- ioral science, very strong in Arnhart, is understand- able. Indeed, it goes to the heart of one of the fundamental elements of ethics itself: Beware of discoveries that can be turned into weapons by your neighbors! But the awful dilemma of such ethical awareness becomes immediately evident when we consider that, as Aristotle well understood, there is imma- nence in the development of systems?organic, intellectual, and otherwise. Science has reached a point where the question, "How much is human social behavior prewired in the brain?" is no longer avoidable. "Reason," thus, demands that we not shy away from the question, that we accept the challenge of the motto "Knowledge ? Freedom," acquire knowledge without prejudice, and form an intellectual guild on the ethically relevant proposi- tion that human evolution has been basically anagenetic?that what unites human beings is far greater and weightier than what sets us apart. It is impossible to explain the misconceptions about sociobiology among many social scientists, apart from this benevolent but misguided concern about the potential danger of the evolutionary vistas now disclosed by sociobiology. How else explain the statement "... Wilson assumes that any belief in heroic transcendence is ultimately merely a mecha- nism for survival and reproductive success"? In the language of science, the locution "ultimately merely" reveals a gross error about the nature of scientific inquiry. The logic of science that has developed in the past half millennium requires that, whenever possi- ble, a set of phenomena be organized in view of the conceptualization of a mechanism, for example, universal gravitation. Statements that define the ways in which the mechanism operates are typically referred to as "laws," "theoretical idealizations," "theorems," depending on the level of generality aimed at by the statements. Explanations of phe- nomena by reference only to the mechanism are typically referred to as "ultimate" explanations. These do not deny the relevance of other, "interven- ing," variables: the so-called "proximate" causes of various degrees of etiological output. Indeed, they require a systematic search of them so as to render the ultimate more nearly comprehensive and infor- mative. For instance, a person jogging in the park, a bird flying in the sky, a meteor entering the atmo- sphere, and a volleyball criss-crossing the net are all subject to the "Newtonian Laws" that define the mechanism of universal gravitation. But in order to account for the full behavior of each case, it is also necessary to appeal to a variety of proximate factors concerning, for example, aerodynamic characteris- tics. Nothing wrong, then, with attempts at ultimate explanations. Indeed, that is the first priority of science, on the epistemologica! truism: first the rule (the law) then the exceptions (the variations). Perfectly valid, however, would be the question whether Wilson, or any other sociobiologist, seeks merely an ultimate explanation of human behavior. True: some human sociobiologists (Wilson excluded) do seem so eager to establish the appropriateness of natural selection that they pay little or no attention to cultural (proximate) factors. But then is it not true that they are not sociocultural scientists, and indeed have been seeking our theoretical involvement in order to have a more nearly thorough grasp of human etiology? It is hardly rational to reproach a blind man for stumbling. Moreover, how is it possible to know, stricto sensu, that they give "too little weight to cultural and cognitive factors" until we embark on a biocultural program of study and discover how much is due to what? We may add that some efforts toward that end are not lacking (e.g., Lumsden and Wilson, 1981, 1983; Lopreato, 1984). Human communication is an arduous affair, and perhaps we should not complain about the disorder, for it may well be one of the forces that, in the last analysis, stimulate debate and, as Arnhart shows in many respects, creativity as well. Still, do sociobiolo- gists "deny that morality and knowledge can ever have any objective grounding in reality"? Wilson's</page><page sequence="38">210 first "dilemma," the starting point of Arnhart's criti- cism, is that "no species, ours included, possesses a purpose beyond the imperatives created by its genetic history." That is, if "the brain [which ulti- mately promotes the survival and multiplication of the genes that direct its assembly"?else, there would be extinction] evolved by natural selection, even the capacities to select particular esthetic judgments and religious beliefs must have arisen by the same mechanistic process." There is a sort of zeugma in Wilson's juxtaposition of "purpose" and "imperatives" in the definition of the dilemma. But the meaning is perfectly clear: the substance of it is that the "imperatives," including the ethical ones, have arisen, ultimately, through natural selection. Sociobiology does not reject the Aristotelian "idea that we can look to human nature as a source of moral and political norms." Indeed it embraces it, and Wilson has just finished saying so. Arnhart's interpretation can only mystify. With the "new natu- ralism" proposed by Wilson, and briefly represented above, "human nature can be laid open as an object of fully empirical research, biology can be put to the service of liberal education, and our self-conception can be enormously and truthfully enriched" (Wilson, 1978:2-4). That entails dissecting the machinery of the mind and retracing its evolutionary history. A second dilemma, "the challenge to science," now arises, to wit: if "innate censors and motivators exist in the brain that deeply and unconsciously affect our ethical premises, which censors and mo- tivators should be obeyed and which ones might better be curtailed and sublimated?" (Wilson, 1978:5-6; see also chap. 2). Clearly, sociobiologists quite agree with the prop- osition that we can and should look to human nature as a source of moral and political norms. They hold, however, that the study of human nature is ethically and scientifically a very complex subject, that it did not end over 23 centuries ago, and that it is today the focus of various penetrating disciplines. More- over, they do not "claim that ethics is simply a mechanism for promoting reproductive success." "Simply" and "ultimately" mean quite different things in scientific reasoning. Ethics has evolved in part under the influence of natural selection and, by definition, ultimately promotes reproductive success in the differential sense accounted for by the logic of natural selection and population genetics. But it does much more: for example, it can contravene the tendency toward reproductive success through the search for spiritual immortality inherent in the (cur- rent) concept of the soul (Lopreato, 1984: chap. 6). The entire logic of evolutionary theory is predicated on the observation of interdependence between genotypical and phenotypical characteristics. Arnhart, therefore, astonishes when he attributes to critic Kitcher what is in fact the cornerstone of sociobiology, namely, that "we are born with biologi- cal propensities" which, however, "shape our con- duct only in combination with our culture, our rea- soning, our physical circumstances, and other factors." Of course! Imagine saying to a physicist, reproachfully, "You must understand that bodies in motion do obey Newtonian laws, but there are various factors that modify the idealized predictions of those laws!" Aristotle For Modern Ethics? Pearson's (1900:12-19, 53-55) reproach of metaphy- sicians for making truth claims for their visions was well-founded to a considerable extent, and Russell (1912:153-61) stated persuasively the relationship between science and philosophy as follows: "those questions which are already capable of definite answers are placed in the sciences, while those only to which, at present, no definite answer can be given, remain to form the residue which is called philosophy." Aristotle himself argues both in the Politics and in the Nicomachean Ethics that ethics belongs not among the "theoretical sciences," but among the "practical" ones, where "we must be satisfied to indicate truth with a rough and general sketch." And rough it is. Arnhart who, if less apologetic, could, like few others, help to refine it in the light of modern scientific developments, and to their mea- surable enrichment, argues in an Aristotelian key that "the political scientist must have some knowl- edge of the human soul as one form of animal life." But what is the soul? In the Nicomachean Ethics, Book I, Aristotle distinguishes "two parts of the soul": "an irrational and a rational part." Each of these is, in turn, divided into two subparts. The latter yields rationality as "reasonableness" and rational- ity in the stricter sense as "possessing reason itself." The former comprises a "vegetative faculty" and "the faculty of appetite or of desire in gen- eral. ..." What is the import of this taxonomy for cognitive psychology, theoretical neurobiology, and other brain and mind sciences? As stated, it is rough, and sounds like Aristotle's absurd explana- tion, within the context of astronomy, of circular motion and the "perfection" of the circle. It is not at any events virtuous, in the Aristotelian sense of moderation (mestot?s tis), to pit Aristotle, for whom even a Golgi feat was utterly inconceivable, against modern, experimental biology. Surely, however, Aristotle is saying something about what today we call brain and mind; and he shows, as a minimum, that evolutionary behavioral science has deep roots and hence an intellectual immanence. Consider, further, from the 1898 Peters translation of the Nicomachean Ethics, Book II, the</page><page sequence="39">211 following statements: "none of the moral excel- lences or virtues is implanted in us by nature; for that which is by nature cannot be altered by train- ing"; "The virtues, then, come neither by nature nor against nature, but nature gives the capacity for acquiring them, and this is developed by train- ing. ..." The two statements appear to be at odds with each other, and yet are suggestive of sociobio- logical theory: We are born with certain behavioral predispositions, or epigenetic rules (e.g., incest avoidance, conformity, reciprocation), and these are then developed by socialization at varying stages of the life cycle, and at different degrees of continuity, depending on the functions of the predispositions (see e.g., Lumsden and Wilson, 1981; Lopreato, 1984). How about the "objections" attributed to Darwin- ian scientists under the heading, "Aristotle's Teleo- logical Biology"? Some are indeed objections; others are not. For example, Darwinians could hardly agree with Aristotle's assumption of fixed species, which gives Arnhart cause both to illuminate the Master's writings and to say unnecessarily odd things about Darwin's theory. But they have no objection, say, to Aristotle's "personification of na- ture as a rational artist with a cosmic design," provided that it be understood, as Aristotle certainly understood it, as a metaphor. Indeed, Darwinians practicing sociobiology employ an analogous meta- phor in their conception of the gene as a "selfish" actor (e.g., Dawkins, 1976). Preconceptions are the stuff of prejudice, unfortu- nate in science as well as in interpersonal relations. Homo sapiens remains an extraordinarily complex object of study. How can we speak of human "nobility," "special dignity," and "divinity" without considering human holocausts, rapes, murders, rac- ism, child abuse, chauvinism, impaling, and belliger- ence?often perpetrated in the name of holy men who advised turning the other cheek? An open mind cannot accept the "assertion of the biological uni- queness and superiority of the human species" unless the assertion can be founded on compara- tive, empirically verifiable observations. It does not seem to be a fact that "the capacity for purposeful conduct guided by rational deliberation is uniquely human." It is grossly false to say that nonhuman animals "live together" "only for the sake of repro- duction." In many species, they seek friendship, they give and receive comfort, they play; they engage in numerous types of intrinsically gratifying social behavior. The Book of Genesis and creation- ism, which transpire from Arnhart's approach to science, are not adequate to the curiosity of the human mind at the eve of the third millennium. We wish to know what other animals are like, through careful research rather than through idle assump- tion, and to know whether we can thereby learn anything about ourselves. We believe that astron- omy and physics became exhilaratingly creative sciences when they questioned the pre-Copernican assumption of geocentrism. Today we are still sad- dled with the sociological corollary of that faulty assumption, anthropocentrism, and there is a strong movement afoot to throw off the yoke. The assertions about the uniqueness of Homo sapiens are made without consideration of the rich studies of animal behavior, not even of the studies of chimpanzees (e.g., de Waal, 1982; Goodall, 1986). Goodall (1986:28), who has for years braved many a danger in the bush, writes: The results of investigations into the higher cognitive abilities of creatures other than our- selves have frequently challenged the unique- ness of the human animal and thus provoked storms of protest. Fortunately, in the true spirit of science many investigators ignored their critics and continued their work. They have discovered abundant evidence of, among others, "strategic intelligence and rationality," "con- cept formation," "symbolic representation," "self- concept," and even "crude artistic representation." Why not examine it? Sociobiology and Morality "Aristotle's biopolitics" is more concerned with eth- ics than with politics (though its author is right in drawing no clearcut line between the two); hence, the following comments will be more directly perti- nent to the question of ethics. From the perspective of today's moral teachings, the Aristotelian position on ethics represents a mixed bag of valuables. Some pronouncements are indefensible and unethical. Aristotle was no de- fender of democracy, for instance, as his democracy was intended only for the citizens of the polis, who were a minority. Furthermore, the "many" among the citizens had nothing more than the "collective wisdom" to judge the merits of their rulers, and thus to elect them. They were not fit to govern. As to the "mass of men," Book I of the Nicomachean Ethics states that they "show themselves utterly slavish in their preference for the life of brute beasts...." For Aristotle, "no man can practise virtue who is living the life of a mechanic or labourer" (Politics, Book III, chap. 5). But Aristotle's ethics seems to fail our modern needs at the very heart of our conception of right and wrong. In Book I, Chapters 3-5, and 13 of the Politics, he discusses the household and the respec- tive roles of its constituents according to a "princi- ple" that "of necessity extends to all mankind." Here are some examples of its application: "... the male is by nature superior, and the female inferior; and the one rules, and the other is ruled." And</page><page sequence="40">212 again: "It is clear, then, that some men are by nature free, and others slaves, and that for these latter slavery is both expedient and right." Aristotle alleg- edly "saw the need for moral reform" but had "cautious reluctance to express this openly." Pop- pycock! Ethics by definition requires courage rather than "cautious reluctance" to say and do what is right. What is the sociobiological approach to morality? Let us first note that the concept of ethics refers both to the set of moral principles guiding human beings at any given time, and to what moral princi- ples ought to be in view of the possibilities sug- gested by human, genetically coded, behavioral predispositions (human nature). The inclusion of the ought clause is widespread in the study of ethics, as is represented, for example, by Kant's Categorical Imperative and Aristotle's own Nicomachean Ethics. The is part of the Ethics is but a starting point (arche), while the ought part concerns first principles (archai) in the profoundly different sense of certain propositions about the purpose and place of humans in society, and what is "good" for them. Arnhart, therefore, seems to err in holding that for Aristotle ethics was "somehow the fulfillment of human nature," or could be defined as follows: "whatever enhances the flourishing of our nature is good, and whatever impedes that flourishing is bad." This position would make (ethical) sense on the assumption that human nature is "good"; but the question for modern scholarship is precisely whether such an assumption is valid. What if there is a nasty streak to human nature? And what if that streak could somehow be mollified in view of the possible knowledge of how it may relate to more beneficent streaks and to culture, including existing moral rules? Why close the book? Why not assume that there is so much more to learn, and possibly so many more bases of "good" to discover? In keeping with the systemic concept of adapta- tion in evolution, sociobiology holds that morality, like other sorts of sociocultural behavior, is ulti- mately rooted in our biological nature, which is constantly interacting with the environment, culture included. Like evolution itself, morality is the resul- tant of this "functional interdependence" between organisms (genes) and environment. Hence, it is itself an evolutionary phenomenon. That is, it is subject to change under the dual and interacting influence of human nature and culture. The more we know, moreover, about human nature, about ethics, and about their interplay, the lower the probability that we make false assumptions about who we are, what we are capable of, and how we should behave. If space permitted, it would be possible to show the biological causes of many moral injunctions, extant and feasible. Those concerning child moles- tation and incestuous sex relations might be espe- cially timely. In view of the above criticism of Aristotle's position on slavery and gender relations, however, I shall conclude with a few comments on these latter two topics. Slavery is absent among nonhuman primates and even among nomadic humans. With only the minor exception of dominance advantages accruing to the nonadult children of some dominant female pri- mates, the reigning fundamental principle is equality of opportunity. Individuals enjoy freedom from any- thing even resembling military and police organiza- tions to challenge anyone in the society for whatever privilege may be attainable. Coalitions, moreover, are freely entered into, and facilitate a challenge of the mighty even on the part of the lowly (e.g., de Waal, 1982; Goodall, 1986). In short, there is no biological provision for enslavement among pri- mates, and thus a moral injunction against slavery is biologically demanded. Aristotle's grasp of human nature was in this respect erroneous. How about gender roles? Are men superior to women? On the average, they are superior only in physical strength, which in the age of universal education, the computer, and space travel is hardly relevant. There is no biological warrant for persisting exploitation of females. While it is best not to make invidious comparisons on the respective evolution- ary value of the two genders, if male peacocking persists, a number of biological facts can be de- pended upon to demonstrate its natural abnormality and immorality. Women, on the average, live longer not because of less stress and other such common sophistries but because they are the bearers of the future generations and natural selection necessarily produced in them a superior, a healthier, organism. A woman contributes to the first full cell of the human organism a biomass investment many thou- sands larger than the male contribution. What is more important, for nine months she nourishes and protects the budding organism within her womb and in the process runs countless risks to her comfort, her aesthetics, and her life. She is then charged with the upbringing of the child during the crucial forma- tive years, and is often called upon to do double duty and compete in the economic market. Nature appointed her teacher, but she is still a rarity in the colleges and universities where the most experienced teaching allegedly takes place. Much could be added, including the fact that up to the time of the horticultural society she, for millions of years, probably provided around 70 percent of her family's diet. Why, then, in an egalitarian society like the United States of America, is the income of female college graduates barely equivalent to the income of males with only a high school diploma?</page><page sequence="41">213 Arnhart deserves high praise for turning our atten- tion to Aristotle. But for a more nearly complete lesson, the immortal genius of the Lyceum deserves another visit. Final Causes and Instant Cases: A Comment Stephen G. Salkever Department of Political Science Bryn Mawr College Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania 19010 I strongly agree with what I take to be Arnhart's basic claims: that Aristotle's teleological biology is plausible in the light of what we now think about good scientific practice, and that it provides a kind of basis or vocabulary for moral and practical delib- eration that is lacking in nonteleological or reduc- tionist biology. Arnhart's defense of these claims is important both because he suggests a more expan- sive notion of what counts as biological science and because he in effect challenges Maclntyre's (1981) claim that Aristotle's biology is "metaphysical" and so cannot serve as a basis for theorizing about moral and political matters. Arnhart makes his case well, and I was especially instructed by his discussion of Sacks' work as an example of a teleological vocabu- lary applied to moral and psychiatric questions. I think, however, that I disagree with some of the implications Arnhart draws from these claims, al- though it may be that such apparent disagreement arises either from lack of clarity on my part, or from difference of opinion about the tone or voice best suited to the defense of Aristotle's teleology. Still, two important substantive issues need clarification. First of all, I do not think that nonteleologists are necessarily nihilists. One can quite coherently be a nonteleological biologist and hold that there are objective moral distinctions, either on the basis of religious opinions or neo-Kantian transcendentalism or from a patriotic commitment to one's culture. Nature is not the only possible source of norms; moreover, for Aristotle, theoretical teleology is not a source of primary moral education at all. What the concept of teleological nature does is to give us a language in which to evaluate, to criticize, and to defend those moral claims we already hold. The way to become good, for Aristotle, is through habit and contextual judgment, not through deductions made from biological laws?to deny this is to run afoul of Aristotle's warning against moralistically supposing that the right sort of philosophy will make us virtu- ous (Nicomachean Ethics 2, 1105b12-18). At any</page><page sequence="42">214 rate, I am not convinced that nihilism is a danger uniquely entailed by reductionist biology or by cul- tural relativism; even if it were, Aristotelian teleology would not be a solution. Thus I disagree with Arnhart concerning the Aris- totelian conception of the relationship between bio- logical theory and political practice. Aristotle pro- vides neither natural laws nor principles for conclusively resolving practical deliberations, but a complex theory of human goods. This theory identi- fies goods or needs, and suggests a ranking of them, but clearly denies the possibility of deriving decision rules from this ranking, since what is most important for human beings abstractly will not be most important in particular cases. The abstract ranking is itself nothing more than a summary of particular cases, not prior to them either in time or in truth. There can be no natural moral laws for Aris- totle since "with us, though probably not at all for the gods, there is somehow a 'by nature' and a 'not by nature' even though everything changes" (Nicomachean Ethics 5, 1134b28-30). This is of course not to say that teleology is irrelevant to practical deliberation, but rather that theoretical interventions (such as Aristotle's discus- sion of slavery in the Politics) are more subtle and less dogmatic than Arnhart seems to me to suggest. Teleology?in Aristotle's version?gives us a way to deliberate the merits of particular policies, but never pretends to deliver clear and certain answers to moral and political questions. As Strauss (1953: 163) says, speaking of Aristotelian natural right: "The only universally valid standard is the hierarchy of ends. This standard is sufficient for passing judg- ment on the level of nobility of individuals and groups and of actions and institutions. But it is insufficient for guiding our actions." If this is a fair statement of the Aristotelian position, I think it is misleading to say, as Arnhart does, that the unique quality of human action is that we "can act through deliberate judgments about general principles." Act- ing deliberately (kata prohairesin) is not for Aristotle ?unlike for Kant?the same as acting from univer- sal principle, but rather acting with an awareness of alternatives and consequences. Such awareness? unlike moral rules?cannot be supplied by any the- ory, though theory can surely help us sort out and rank alternatives. My second possible point of disagreement with Arnhart concerns his account of the nature of teleo- logical explanation itself. The issue is this: is the telos of an organism the efficient (or motive) cause of that organism's characteristics? In other words, if we say that normal development of the organism causes the structure of DNA, and that a chemical reaction causes this structure, are we using the word "cause" in the same sense in both statements ?as the compelling or necessitating agent? Or again, if both sexual drive and the education of children (or friendship) are causes of the human family, does "cause" have a single sense in both cases? In general, is the reason for a phenomenon (or any explanandum) a kind of motive for that phenomenon, or are motive and reason two distinct kinds of cause? While Arnhart recognizes that Aris- totle combines "teleological and mechanistic analy- sis," his interesting comparison of biological and chemical explanations seems to suggest that he would answer this question in the affirmative: "In chemistry causes explain their effects; in biology effects explain their causes." This formulation sug- gests that goals necessitate the actions leading up to them in the same way that Humeian efficient causes necessitate their consequences. But to say this is to turn the telos into a demiurge external to the organism, which Arnhart implies in referring to DNA as "like an engineer." But I think that Aristotle suggests that there is a fundamental difference between the two different kinds of causality, the types of explanantes for phenomena in the natural world1. To know the telos of a behavioral or physiological trait is not to know its necessitating conditions, but rather to know the way the trait functions in the normal life of the particular kind of organism in question?to know what makes the trait reasonable for that animal's way of life rather than what motivates or necessi- tates it. Traits or natural events have two separate kinds of causes, neither reducible to the other. The clearest Aristotelian example is his comment in De Anima (403a24-b2) to the effect that there are two distinct causes of anger, both a boiling of blood around the heart and a desire for revenge: the first states anger's necessitating condition, the second, the place anger has in human life. To know the causes of anger, in the dualistic Aristotelian rather than the monistic Humeian sense of causality, it is necessary to know both kinds, even though the teleological explanation is (theoretically) more im- portant?because more directly related to the ani- mal observed?than the efficient or necessitating cause. Thus the telos or teleological cause of a natural organism is not external to its own develop- ment, unlike the relationship of engineer and struc- ture. The self-doctoring doctor (Physics 2, 199b30- 32) is a better metaphor for teleological cause, but there is some disanalogy here as well, since "health" exists independently of the doctor but not of the organism. What is central to Aristotle's idea of teleological cause, I think, is not that conduct or physiological development is somehow drawn along by an ideal end state, but the premise that the world we ob- serve happens to be a world of wholes, of organized potential or necessitating causes, rather than of</page><page sequence="43">215 independent corpuscular events. These wholes or organisms are composed of and necessitated by such events, but have attributes (for example, needs) that cannot be explained by reference to the way such organisms are generated. A good example of this can be drawn from one of Aristotle's best known explanations of the causes of the polis: it comes into being for the sake of living, but is for the sake of living well (Politics 1, 1252b29-30). "Living well" is the final cause of politics not in the sense that it motivates or produces cities?although in some cases it may do that as well?but rather in the sense that "living well" is the human need or attribute that connects political activity to the pat- tern of life that distinguishes human beings from other organisms. I can't imagine ever knowing for certain that our world is one of irreducible wholes rather than the corpuscular world presupposed by reductionist biol- ogy. But as Arnhart argues, given what we do know and how we go about our attempts to know more, the first or Aristotelian world seems a good deal more plausible than the second. And, as he also argues, taking the world teleologically gives us a way of introducing the results of theoretical scien- tific inquiry into our practical deliberation. But I would suggest that these claims are true only insofar as we are careful to distinguish teleological causes from high-powered or quasi-divine efficient causes, and to recognize that teleological analysis does not yield action-determining natural laws. Oth- erwise our zeal in the face of modern "spiritual dilemmas" may lead to a reenactment of the medie- val distortion of Aristotelian teleology rather than to a new articulation of the thing itself. Note 1. Plato makes a similar distinction between aitia and sunaitia in the Statesman. On the Problematic Dimensions of Bioethics and the Pr?-Conditions of Natural Right Leonard R. Sorenson Assumption College Worcester, Massachusetts 01609 A group of scholars are currently engaged in a project to forge a new, or revive an old, discipline called bioethics. A few of them deserve special praise at least for addressing themes in a manner which points toward most fundamental issues or problems.1 Above all, one must stand somewhat in awe of the intention of Arnhart as expressed in his work, "Aristotle's Biopolitics: A Defense of Biologi- cal Teleology Against Biological Nihilism." Arnhart possesses the courage to confront and attempt to overcome the boundaries that separate disciplines seemingly different in kind and, more importantly, to do so in order to address the fundamental human problem of our time?nihilism. Arnhart identifies the source and consequences of and, even more boldly, suggests a solution to, that "abysmal thought... that there is no rationally discoverable standard in nature for giving meaning to life" in general and "for guiding human life" in particular.2 The Source and Consequences of Nihilism According to Arnhart, the source of nihilism is modern reason itself: its teaching on nature, human nature, and the meaning or purpose of reason. Reason, so to speak, discovered that nonhuman nature is nonteleological and can be explained in terms of efficient and material causality. As such, nature is a meaningless mechanism which, though morally neutral, is predictable, hence controllable, and therefore able to be mastered for human pur- pose. The purpose of reason is not to know nature and the purpose of nature is not to be known. Reason is a means to master nature for human purpose or good. Reason teaches that neither non- human nature nor human reason are purposeful. Reason discovers more, namely, that it cannot even discover natural purpose in the non- or sub- rational dimensions of the human. Human purpose, the end of reason in its instrumental mastery of nature, is itself not only nonrational, but also irratio-</page><page sequence="44">216 nal. Human, nonrational, purposes are not the prod- uct of nature but of accidental, arbitrary change, or of historical-social circumstances, or of choice alone. Finally, reason itself discovers that it too is not only the instrument of the arbitrary but also came into being by a meaningless, purposeless accident. Reason itself is an accidental effect on an arbitrary change or cause. Moreover, nihilism is the product of reason's claim to know that it can neither be nor discover human purpose. The practical consequences of this "abysmal thought" are traced by Arnhart with uncompromis- ing, unflinching nerve. In principle, the necessary practical conclusion of nihilism is skepticism or radical relativism. For better or worse, this practical conclusion is, according to Arnhart, no longer merely an "academic" issue but is gradually trickling down into actual practice in response to the ethical dilem- mas raised by biomedicai technology and to the new possibility, made feasible by genetic engineer- ing, that humans may soon be able to make them- selves, within what limits we do not know, into whatever they wish.2 Humanity is now in the curious position of being able to provide great benefit but unable to defend, by reason, any given definition of benefit because the very ideas of better or worse are groundless. Genetic engineering may offer us the promise of the capacity to know how to make ourselves, even how to make ourselves into human-makers, but we liter- ally cannot know what to make of ourselves. If nihilism is true, then, according to Arnhart, it neces- sarily follows in principle as well as practice that there is no rational ground for preference. There is no reason to prefer health to sickness, pleasure to pain, life to nonlife. These are mere names we give to our subjective preferences. Even the genetic engineer cannot rationally defend the preference of becoming a genetic engineer. The choices or desires to learn how to make, and actually to make humans, are themselves arbitrary desires or choices. Nihilism means that reason teaches that all prefer- ence as such is subjective and arbitrary. The Cure for Nihilism According to Arnhart, the only cure for nihilism is the revival of the possibility of natural right. To produc- tively refer the question of "right" to nature, nature must either mean, or at least be, the following. First, one must mean by nature that which is or exists as the object of definition. Nature or human nature must not merely exist in or by human definition. For human purpose or right to be meaningful, it must, so to speak, be independent of human will, definition, or making. Second, nature must express order which, as such, can indicate direction, guidance, or purpose. Third, and related to the second, nature must be, or include, a fixed or unchanging element. Order means fixity or, rather, we can presume order only on the basis of fixity. Arnhart seeks to escape the diverse, conflicting, contradictory, or changing opinions of "right." Arnhart seeks "true right" which is to say a standard of judging changing right. Fourth, "nature" must mean "universal" for it and its purpose to apply equally to all humans. Lastly, only to the extent that nature is thought of in these terms can the question of right be referred to it and also be potentially graspable by unaided human reason. Arnhart intends a doctrine of natural right which allows reason to transcend both revelation and relativism and hence nihilism. Arnhart's proposed cure for nihilism is rational, hence natural, right. More specifically, Arnhart's cure for nihilism is the rehabilitation of natural right by means of resuscita- tion, not of modern or contemporary natural right, but of Aristotelian teleology. In particular, Arnhart makes the following seven claims: (1) that there is evidence to support biological teleology, by which he means that being takes persistent order ex- pressed as functions, shapes, or forms different in kind; (2) that such "forms," since so ordered, are the natural ends or purposes of the beings; (3) that ends are also causes in the sense that efficient and material causality is harnessed or directed to or by such ends; (4) that, therefore, mechanism is compat- ible with (since subordinate to) teleology; (5) that human biological teleology is related to ethical tele- ology in that one can only derive the content of the latter by means of the study of the former on the basis of the fundamental premise that one can "derive moral norms from biological facts;" (6) that teleology is compatible with contemporary evolu- tion, understood as teaching that beings even differ- ent in kind change, because the change happens quickly and stops for a while; and finally, (7) that a natural hierarchy and subordination among species, kinds or purposes, can be defended without the support of the hypothesis of a cosmic teleology. For the sake, as will be shown, of the crucial issues and arguments, I grant Arnhart ideas (1) to (4) and proceed, in what follows, to examine ideas (5) through (7). Can Ethical Norms Be Derived From Biological Facts? Arnhart claims that he employs the example and work of the eminent Dr. Sacks as an illustration of his thesis that one can "derive" ethical teleology from biological facts. He interprets the example for us to show that it can only be "understood" or explained by adapting the "premodern account of nature found in Aristotle's biology." It is presented as a kind of commonsense illustration that has embedded within it evidence for his Aristotelian thesis, which itself is drawn from common sense.</page><page sequence="45">217 More specifically, Arnhart claims that the example shows that the general content of the meaning of biological form is the "normal functioning" of a being and that one can derive the ethical norm from the "normal functioning" of human biology. How- ever, Arnhart's example, first, does not support his claim and, second, implies not ethical teleology but a version of ethical determinism. The Sacks example does present us with a doctor who acts as though, or as Arnhart himself states "assumes... implicitly" that, there is a natural stan- dard by which one can properly distinguish better from worse, "disorder" or "disturbance" from order, and health from sickness. The "normal" is identified as the "natural" that is good and the "abnormal" is, as such, bad. Further, the ethical is identified with the "self" or "soul," and a "normal," hence healthy "soul," in turn, is characterized as follows: it is in possession of the "natural freedom" to choose, and it can and should choose "balance" or moderation, the mean between all extremes. The example also indicates that science has discovered that one "normal" biological state is to possess a certain level of dopamine in the brain. It is shown, further, that there is a correspondence between the ethical "soul" state and the biological norm and that the correlation is causal in that the latter is "inseparably tied" to the former which, is therefore "open to neurological explanation and control." Yet Arnhart does not show Sacks coming to know what a "normal" or healthy "soul" state is by means of biological studies. But is that not what would be required in order to demonstrate the claim that ethical norms can be derived from biological facts? In fact, Arnhart himself shows that Sacks' "wise judgment about what constitutes psychic health" itself derives from a source independent of and prior to biological studies. It is only because Sacks has prior knowledge of what constitutes a "normal hu- man life" or "being," the "natural freedom" to choose, and to choose moderation, that he is even able to "recognize" for instance, Tourette's syn- drome as abnormal and therefore bad in the first place. Moreover, since Arnhart claims that the ethical domain is a "soul" state and that ethical teleology can be "derived" from biological teleology, then he must show in his Sacks example that which he does not, namely: (1) the discovery of what is a "normal" amount of dopamine in the human brain and; (2) since an excess of it is abnormal, and therefore bad, the discovery of the correlative psychic expression caused by the abnormal biological state, which soul state therefore could then; (3) be known as abnor- mal, and therefore bad, which; (4) disorder, now known as such, could perhaps be cured. Arnhart's example does show a doctor acting on the premise of ethical teleology: that humans by nature possess soul which is or has a capacity for free choice and that the worthy choice, in this case moderation, is so by nature. The example does not show ethical teleology discovered by means of biological science. The example does not support Arnhart's claim that in search of ethical teleology we must "revive the premodern account of nature found in Aristotle's biology." Neither does Arnhart show that Sacks himself knows by the study of biology or body that his ethical purpose is to study to learn the "normal" and how to attain it when it is lacking for the sake of "serving nature's end," the normality of his patients. Does the ability to learn have a biological norm correlate? Does other-regardedness, expressed by the doctor as the concern for the health of others, have a biological norm correlate? If so, and if they were known, how could one such as Sacks discover by means of the study of biology the hierarchy between the two biological norms, that which one would have to know in order to judge between the decision to become either a theoretical biologist or a family doctor? Following Arnhart's lead, the beginning of a solu- tion might be to discover that one "unique" biologi- cal norm which by nature distinguishes human beings in kind from other beings. Perhaps one could discover that dopamine and a certain level of it is possessed by human beings alone and that its single "psychic" correlate is the capacity freely to choose moderation. If one did possess such knowl- edge, would it solve our problem? Would one then freely choose to moderately pursue knowledge of genetics or the health of one's patients, or to moderately pursue a little of each in some balance? Would not such a course of action be to the detriment, in either case, of both the advance of knowledge and a patient's health? Would either moderate path be "serving nature's end?" Arnhart's version of bioethics also leads to a form of ethical determinism, not teleology. According to Arnhart, biological forms, including therefore the human biological form, are "completed automati- cally" unless the growth of the form to its normal state is subjected to accidental, external conditions or causes outside of its control. Only such condi- tions are said to cause, and hence explain, biologi- cal disorder or defect. But also according to Arnhart, ethical teleology presupposes natural freedom or "moral choice." Hence, ethical teleology supposes that our moral "defect" must be primarily caused by ourselves, our mistakes, errors, or bad choices. But if Arnhart's bioethics supposes a causal correspon- dence between biological and ethical psychic states, and if the cause of biological disorder is</page><page sequence="46">218 external accident, then must not the cause of ethical disorder also be external accident, not free choice? If so, must those who do not possess, or properly exercise, free choice be considered not to be the cause of their defect and hence be free from blame or punishment? The alternative position is that the development of the proper psychic state is primarily an effect of choice, that choosing the naturally choice-worthy results in a proper psychic state, and that a biological state is, in large part, the effect of the psychic state. But if so, then one could not look to the biological state for normative guidance: bio- logical facts would be derived from ethical norms, not the "soul" norms from biological facts. Arnhart seems to admit as much by his agreement with Aristotle's position that humans are bipedal because humans are rational animals, not that humans are rational animals because they are bipedal. Does not Arnhart's form of search for bioethics appear to lead to an ethical teaching that must deny either choice or biology as its essential foundation? Is Aristotelian Teleology Compatible With the Idea of Changing Kinds? The attempt to combine teleology with evolution raises as many questions as does the attempt to derive ethical norms from biological facts. Arnhart claims that contemporary evolution teaches, first, that the diverse forms of beings are means; second, that they are means to the common ends of preser- vation and reproduction; and, third, that forms change. By teleology he means that forms are purposes or ends. Therefore, even if forms are natural and fixed, Arnhart cannot adapt the first teaching of evolution because, according to that teaching, forms are means, not ends or purposes. Arnhart means by human purpose that which both distinguishes human beings in kind and is higher than preservation and reproduction. Therefore, he also cannot adapt the second teaching of evolution. Arnhart does, however, proceed to accept the third teaching of evolution?that forms change?and to combine his modified version of evolution with his view of teleology. The result is the following hybrid, five-part teaching: that forms distinguish in kind not degree; that forms are ends not means; that the human purpose is to reason; that kinds change; and that changing kinds is compatible with Aristotle on teleology. In what follows I question the compatibil- ity of the last three ideas. Arnhart means by changing kinds that the distinc- tions in kind are not "externally fixed." By that he means that kinds change one into the other, that one kind emerges from another. He does not mean, for instance, that something or kind can come from nothing, or that kinds can come into being and pass away cyclically according to some fixed principle or definition which does not come into being or change. He means that kinds themselves change, purpose changes. Purposes must, therefore, come into being. The question for Arnhart is, what causes and hence explains changing purposes or the com- ing into being of a given purpose? Arnhart appears to be of two minds in response to this question. On the one hand, he appears to agree that "if... forms... have emerged simply as products of chance... [then]... we must conclude that there is no [meaningful human]... purpose." On the other hand, he appears to deny that kinds change accord- ing to any "predetermined" path or purpose. If purposes change, come into being, then they must do so as the effect of either accident or purpose. But did not Arnhart refer the question of right or purpose to nature precisely in order to overcome changing, accidental, or arbitrary purposes? Now, if nature or natural purpose itself changes and comes into being by accident, it is difficult to understand what can be gained, from Arnhart's own perspective, by the attempt to ground right or purpose in nature. Does not nature now appear to exhibit the very qualities that Arnhart appeals to it for in order to overcome? I do not understand how the length of time of the existence of a given form or definition, short of eternity, bears on the questions raised by its acci- dental origin and its changing nature. If, on the other hand, the cause or explanation of changing kinds is purpose and not accident, then the changing kinds must find their purpose outside of themselves. There must be a purpose for pur- poses and their change. There must be purpose beyond forms. There must be, in other words, cos- mic teleology, precisely that which Arnhart denies. Further, to know that purposes change purposefully one would have to know the purpose and how the changing purposes relate to the purpose. The idea of purposeful, rational change over time points towards a modified form of Hegelian teleology based on an absolute moment in which the purpose of changing purposes can be known only after the purposes have reached their purpose. Moreover, the idea of accidental, changing purpose does not fulfill the purpose of Arnhart's appeal to Aristotelian tele- ology, to ground right in nature; and purposefully changing purpose is not Aristotelian teleology. But I do not understand how differences in kind, even a single natural difference in kind within the whole, can change into one another, or emerge one from the other. Arnhart means by differences in kind the difference between an inanimate and an animate being; a rational and a nonrational being; a free and a determined being; a being with a "mind" or "soul," an incorporeal and a corporeal being; and even the being and non-being of a given kind, and hence, I suppose even being and non-being itself. Difference in kind therefore means that one is not another. But for one kind to change into another kind</page><page sequence="47">219 must not there be at least a moment of transition? And, if so, must not there be a point of contact between each of the distinguishing features? If so, must not those distinguishing features themselves share something or be like? But if two distinguishing features are like, then they are by definition precisely not distinctions in kind\n the first place. Evolutionary change of forms requires the premise that all differ- ences are by degree, precisely because the idea of changing kinds is a contradiction. The idea (and even existence) of changing kinds is possible but not intelligible. Yet does not Arnhart seek rational natural right? The idea of changing kinds presents a third problem for Arnhart's teleology. According to Arnhart, a natural distinction in kind indicates the purpose of a being; the distinction and hence pur- pose of humans is to reason. The goal of reasoning is to know. And the objects of knowledge, since he denies cosmic teleology, must be the definitions of the kinds. Further, Arnhart indicates what else he means by a proper object of knowledge. He claims that even Darwin's discovery of evolution and in particular, the "natural," fixed, unchanging ends of the evolutionary process, could mean that reason, not preservation and reprocdution, is the highest purpose of human beings. Evidently, according to Arnhart, a premise of intelligibility, and therewith the status of human reason itself, is the existence of an unchanging object. But according to Arnhart's teaching on evolution, the kinds change. They are even said to change quickly, staying afterward as they are for a long time. I do not see why this change could not, in principle, occur right before one's eyes. Arnhart's idea of changing kinds is not compatible with his account of a condition of possi- bility of intelligibility, an unchanging object for rea- son; and consequently is also incompatible with his claim that reason indicates humanity's natural pur- pose. Would it not be a harsh, unkind, nature, a very curious nature, that produced reason oriented to knowledge of kinds as human purpose and then proceeded to produce an unintelligible world, a world of arbitrary change? Is a Hierarchy and Subordination Among Species Possible Without Cosmic Teleology? Granting that nature distinguished humans, in kind, with reason, Arnhart proceeds to argue to the follow- ing conclusions: that there is a natural hierarchy and subordination among the species, among the differ- ent ends or purposes of the different beings; that the rational being is at the "peak" or "top" of the beings; and that one can sustain this hierarchy- subordination without the support of a cosmic teleol- ogy. The argument is that comprehensiveness estab- lishes hierarchy. By "comprehensive" Arnhart means, at least initially, all other and one more. To be more precise, since human beings contain within themselves all of the other distinguishing features and transcends them by one, they are therefore, as Mork once addressed his supreme being, "Your most massive multi-magni-dude, the magnifi-gent of the Cosmos".3 But a hierarchy of beings can only be established if one distinguishing feature itself can be shown to be higher than the other distinguishing features. Arnhart does adapt this second, improved ground of hierarchy. He also identifies human distinction itself as the ground or meaning of "comprehensive." Reason is the highest distinction because it is "comprehensive" in the sense that it alone among all the distinctions allows one in a certain sense, to be all, to know all. This simply means that reason is the only naturally distinct capacity that allows, at least in principle, one to know "all" the beings. Being expresses itself as ordered into different kinds which, therefore, can be subjected to definition. Humans are the only beings who, by means of reason, can define. Therefore, reason is the most comprehensive and hence the highest capacity, in that only it can participate in, or incorporate into itself, the essence of "all" beings, their definition. But even this second, improved meaning of com- prehensiveness must rest upon a prior premise for it to be the ground of natural hierarchy and subordina- tion among species. That knowing is the human species' purpose and that the world is such that it can be known, does not prove that knowing is higher than not knowing, except for human beings. Only if the ultimate purpose of the knowables, the knowable beings, is to be known or to participate in knowing, can seeking to know or knowing be the highest distinguishing feature. Only if the ultimate purpose of the distinct forms is to be known, if forms exist for the sake of being known, can it be claimed that the naturally distinct seeker or knower is higher than the other beings. Humans are higher than the other beings because without humans the other beings could not reach their own perfection, which is to be known. The potential knower, in the very act of knowing, mutually actualizes, perfects the pur- pose of humans and the ultimate purpose of the beings themselves. Comprehensiveness in the form of the capacity to become all by knowing "all" establishes hierarchy among all on the basis of the premise that the purpose of the whole is to be known. Hierarchy among species requires cosmic teleology, precisely that which Arnhart denies. Subordination among species, in turn, follows from hierarchy properly understood. Subordination of species is only naturally right, as opposed to</page><page sequence="48">220 necessary, to the extent that it is for the sake of the cosmically grounded hierarchy. Rational beings can properly employ or use other beings only to the extent that those beings are incorporated, even if very indirectly, into the philosophic project, into the common purpose of species, namely to know or at least to be known. It would be a mistake not to admit graciously the great debt we owe to Arnhart, especially for the kinds of questions he forces us to raise. Much like the doctor in his own example, he has correctly recognized the source and prognosis of, and even pointed towards the cure for, the disease of our age. And he, like a good patient, even seems to have followed his own doctor's advice of moderation in proposing his cure. It is a moderate cure in that it contains a balance and even a little of the disease itself, as if he, like the practitioner of homeopathic medicine of old, considers the intensification of disease or its symptoms as part of the cure. He may be right! I am no doctor. I am, and I hope he considers me to be, a cranky but grateful patient. Notes 1.

One must add that the truth and consequences of nihilism have also penetrated the very disciplines from which we, traditionally, sought guidance on such issues, as shown in a recent best-selling book by Bloom, The Closing of the American Mind.

Wiser College of Arts and Sciences Loyola University of Chicago Chicago, Illinois 60626 Arnhart's "Aristotle's Biopolitics: A Defense of Bio- logical Teleology against Biological Nihilism" is both a valuable and yet at the same time a problematic study. Its value for political science lies in Arnhart's reminder that for many of the most important think- ers in the history of Western political thought their efforts to discover and articulate the principles of a political order necessarily presupposed a specific understanding of the order of nature itself. Given this, the fundamental political challenge of the mod- ern scientific and industrial revolutions not only includes the new instruments and techniques of organization and manipulation made possible by the discoveries of modern science, but also those cul- tural and intellectual assumptions which create that very environment within which such instruments and techniques first became possible. In illustrating this intimate relationship between modern natural sci- ence and modern political science, Grant (1976:124) has written: "What calls out for recognition here is that the same apprehension of what it is to be 'reasonable' leads men to build computers and to conceive the universal and homogenous society as the highest political goal. The ways such machines can be used must be at one with certain concep- tions of political purposes because the same kind of 'reasoning' made the machines and formulated the purposes. To put the matter extremely simply, the modern physical sciences and the modern political sciences have developed in mutual interp?n?tration, and we can only begin to understand that interp?n?- tration in terms of some common source from which both forms of science found their sustenance." Arnhart's aride is sweeping in scope and, as a consequence, deals both directly and indirectly with a number of complicated themes and issues. Given the constraints of this commentary, I will select only two arguments which I find to be somewhat prob- lematic.</page><page sequence="49">221 The Defense of Aristotle In general, Arnhart's summaries of Aristotle's under- standing of ethics, politics, and the natural order are essentially sound and clearly presented. However, in his defense of Aristotle against sociobiology on one hand and Darwinian biology on the other, the au- thor's arguments are somewhat more questionable. First, Arnhart attempts to defend Aristotle against the suspicion that some might associate his linking of biology and ethics with that form of biological reductionism often attributed to sociobiology. He does so first by reviewing Kitcher's critique of modern "pop sociobiology" and then by showing how such a critique could not in fact apply to the position of Aristotle. The whole argument, however, appears as a pseudo-problem and generates, there- fore, a pseudo-solution. Kitcher's critique is a cri- tique of "pop sociobiology." Its effectiveness is to be measured in terms of how well it deals with the claims of those he is actually investigating. If some have accused Aristotle of biological reductionism, then Arnhart should look at their concrete argu- ments and evaluate them according to his own understanding of Aristotle's work. To place Aristotle among the "pop sociobiologists" and then to argue that such a placement was wrong in the first place is simply to create a false dilemma. If others have done so, then Arnhart should examine their work. But as presented in the article, this dilemma appears to be of Arnhart's own making. More importantly, however, I believe that in his defense of Aristotle against Darwinian biology, Arnhart has failed to portray adequately the true and critical differences between these two positions. In effect, he appears to "solve" the problems much too easily. It is true as Arnhart claims (and, indeed, as Collingwood had already argued in the 1930s) that modern biology has retained a teleological language in spite of the mechanistic spirit of modern science. As Grene (1974) has argued, wherever there is reference to part-whole relations, to means-end rela- tions, or to goal-governed processes, there is teleo- logical discourse. Thus, in morphology, physiology, and embryology such language is common. Yet, the persistence of teleological language does not mean that modern science has in fact substituted as an ontological principle the Aristotelian understanding of vital process for the Newtonian conception of mechanical or chemical change: 'There are teleological explanations but any explanation that succeeds in explaining anything does so in virtue of our impressions that we have achieved an understanding of something in the real world which we have previously found puz- zling. If, therefore, teleological explanation is a genuine part of the knowledge of living things, it is so because living things are not apparently but genuinely telic. It is again the lingering authority of the machine analogy that prevents our admit- ting the truth of this statement. Before we can firmly assent to the telic character of living things including ourselves, we shall need to complete a very fundamental revision of our basic ways of thinking." (Grene, 1974:178-179) If Grene is correct and if one looks beyond the formal evidence of language symbols, it would ap- pear that in some (though not all) important aspects modern biology is fundamentally un-Aristotelian. It may be wrong in being so, but such differences should not be too easily resolved. For example, Arnhart discusses the Darwinian critique of Aristotle's belief in the eternity of fixed species. After accounting for this "mistake" by reminding us of Aristotle's commitment to empirical observation and thus the "misleading" nature of his experience, Arnhart appears to "resolve" the issue by suggesting that even if the species are not eternally fixed, they are nonetheless real during the time of their existence. By thus treating the issue as if it were essentially one of mere duration, Arnhart blunts the more radical nature of the modern cri- tique. Modern biology's challenge to the concept of eternal fixed species is the direct questioning of a central Aristotelian concept, the eidos. For Aristotle, the eidos was the intrinsic end point (telos) or that for the sake of which a series of events takes place. For any given species, it was to be found in the mature form of the adult individual of that species. In the case of the human species, for example, the eidos was understood to be the fully virtuous per- son. This is particularly important for Aristotle's political and ethical thought because, as Arnhart has shown, Aristotle's teachings about the good person or the good regime are grounded in a description of human and political order as it is revealed in its fully developed or perfected forms. For modern evolution- ary biology, however, there is no fixed form. The eidos itself has become transitory and thus the goal or telos of individual development becomes species survival. When the eidos becomes transitory, even if it is real while it exists, the adult individual can no longer serve as the standard of natural develop- ment. Since the end point is no longer fixed in advance, the adult individual is simply the inescap- able outcome of the preceding events. In short, the adult individual of such a kind is no longer a measure of the success of that series of events which produced it because it is simply a necessity and not an achievement. This, it seems to me, presents a serious challenge to Aristotle's effort to construct an understanding of the good life in terms of its contribution to the development of the fully mature individual (Spoudios). This issue is not re- solved by simply referring, as Arnhart does, to Gould's description of species as stable entities with fuzziness at their origin.</page><page sequence="50">222 The Challenge of Nihilism At both the beginning and at the conclusion of his article, Arnhart argues that we are faced with a choice between nihilistic skepticism or Aristotelian teleology. This set of alternatives is certainly dra- matic but it may not be fully accurate. I am not sure that Arnhart meant to imply that these are the only alternatives available to modernity but, even if he did not, such an impression must be challenged. There are, of course, a variety of non-modern alterna- tives to nihilism other than Aristotelianism. In the West, the most obvious example is the Judaeo- Christian tradition. In addition, however, there are a number of alternatives to nihilism offered from within modernity itself. The various forms of Kantian philos- ophy are just one example. One should be cautious before simply granting Nietzsche his point that the modern project is essentially nihilistic. He may in fact be correct but this position must be argued and not simply asserted. Even if for the moment we accept the suggestion that the crisis of our age forces us to choose between nihilistic skepticism and Aristotelian teleol- ogy, it is important to understand that in reality the choice is not between two theories. There is a tendency in Arnhart's article to present the two positions as simply theories, and then to argue for the one by highlighting the unacceptable conse- quences of the other. From my perspective, the current crisis will not be resolved by deciding which of the two theories is "better" in some logical or formal sense. Aristotle developed his theories in order to account for and give expression to his experience of reality as a meaningfully structured whole. The skeptical nihilist on the other hand does not experience reality in this way. The real issue, consequently, is not one concerned with the theoret- ical sophistication of either position but rather with the adequacy or the truth of those experiences for the sake of which such theories are created. As Polanyi has shown, even the most abstract of the natural sciences is essentially an explication of a specific and concrete perception of reality. What is needed is not an abstract analysis of the logical consequences of a set of theoretical postulates. Rather, what we must do is undertake an analysis of the perceptions or human experiences upon which such theories are built. We must analyze those forms of consciousness which are open to the meaning of reality and those which are not. In his own way, Arnhart points in the direction of such an analysis when he repeatedly refers to the principles of common sense. One must be careful, however, not to confuse the principles of common sense with the standards of one's own society. It is here, perhaps, rather than in the reintroduction of certain classical theories that Aristotle, along with that other great critic of scientific skepticism, Thomas Re?d, may be most relevant to our modern situation.</page><page sequence="51">223 AUTHOR'S RESPONSE "In the theatre," Giuseppe Verdi once explained, "long is synonymous with boring. And boring is the worst of all styles." Those who read scholarly jour- nals must be more patient than opera audiences, and this surely must be true of those who have just read my long article and the nine commentaries. I will not test the limits of that patience, however, by responding at length to all the comments. I am grateful to all the commentators for their instructive remarks, which I will be pondering for a long time. But now I can only answer briefly some of the most prominent objections. Engelhardt on Freedom A common criticism of Kant is that his appeal to the principle of noncontradiction cannot justify freedom as a value. Engelhardt escapes that criticism by arguing for freedom as a condition for morality rather than as a value in itself: if people want to settle moral disputes peacefully, then they must accept "the constraint of not using unconsented-to force against the innocent" (Engelhardt, 1986:69). Al- though he acknowledges no debt to Hobbes, Engel- hardt's reasoning is Hobbesian. Moved by the fear of human violence, reason dictates certain "articles of peace" as the necessary conditions for morality (cf. Hobbes, n.d.: chaps. 13-15, and Engelhardt, 1986:3-6, 43-44, 46, 49, 68-70, 75-76, 79, 85-86). Like Hobbes, Engelhardt's commitment to nomi- nalist conventionalism makes his reasoning self- refuting. For example, to allow infanticide Engel- hardt (1986:60) must insist that "a claim that infants are persons as adults are persons is clearly false." Yet in the light of his nominalism, how can anything be "clearly false?" He quotes a passage from an ancient Roman textbook of gynecology by Soranus, who explains to midwives how to recognize "the infant which is suited by nature for rearing." Engel- hardt (1986:229) then assesses Soranus's remarks as "a reasonable sketch by an intelligent physician of how to take into account factors that are predic- tive of futility and cost of treatment, and of quality of life." The phrase "quality of life" takes the place of Soranus's appeal to "nature" (1986:231, 234, 243). Unlike Hobbes, Engelhardt's argument (1986:131- 32, 136-43, 156) for freedom as a side constraint would require anarchism. "Governments are morally suspect, for they traditionally use force to coerce those in their territory to accept their authority" (1986:141). It is not even clear to me how Engelhardt can allow defensive force against aggressors with- out violating freedom as a side constraint. He relies on Nozick's (1974:31) principle "that individuals are ends and not merely means; they may not be sacrificed or used for the achieving of other ends without their consent." Does punishing aggressors without their consent treat them as means rather than as ends in themselves? In any case, Engelhardt makes it clear that his principle of freedom as a side constraint leaves us free to abolish our freedom. After all, he looks forward to the day when drugs can be used to induce good character traits, so that we can prac- tice the "bioengineering of virtue." Divine grace will be supplanted by "biotechnological grace" (Engel- hardt, 1986:384). I am reminded of Kass's (1985:71) warning that as science gives us more power over nature in the service of our capricious desires, the most fearful danger "is not tyranny but voluntary dehumanization." The Contingency of Species Sorenson and Wiser are correct in saying that the question of the fixity of species should not be treated as if it were only a question of duration. Even if species are stable entities, the contingency of their origins challenges Aristotle's belief in the eter- nity of species. I would agree with Cornell that the Darwinian search for the universal origins of species</page><page sequence="52">224 can distort our view of the phenomena. And I appreciate his thoughtful comments on the compar- ative method of Aristotle's natural history. I would argue, however, that we can accept the evolution of species, even as we recognize that this is not the whole story, without denying the fundamental princi- ples of Aristotle's biology. Unlike Plato, Aristotle sees intelligible forms not as things that transcend the physical world but as principles of things immanent in the physical world. Forms are the acts of matter. They are the observ- able regularities in sensible phenomena. And since Aristotle sees all the natural bodies of our earthly experience as changeable, there is no reason in principle why natural speices must be eternal and immutable (Adler, 1940; Deely, 1969). The modern Aristotelian might say that whatever forms of life have emerged in evolutionary history were eternal possibilities from the beginning, but he would not see these eternal possibilities as eternally pre-ex- isting ideas. There are two reasons why Aristotle believed species were eternal, and they both arise from inadequate or distorted evidence. Since he did not have the geological record of extinct species that was available to Darwin, Aristotle relied on the evidence of direct observation that species do not change. And his belief in the eternity of the celestial spheres led him to infer that these eternal things "above the moon" would regulate living things "below the moon" eternally. He admitted that belief in the eternal heavens was based largely on opin- ions handed down by cultural tradition, opinions that were not completely reliable (On the Heavens, 270b1-25; Meta, 1074M-14; Nussbaum, 1978:121- 42). Consequently, in his speculations about such matters, he reasoned "in part by way of assumption, in part by way of demonstration" (On the Heavens, 269b12-20). Although many of the conclusions of Aristotle's science have been shown by modern scientists to be either false or only partially true, Aristotle's causal methodology for the scientific explanation of nature still constitutes the foundation of natural science. Contrary to what is often assumed, the modern "scientific revolution" can be understood as an extension of Aristotelian thought (Wallace, 1972, 1984). This is more than simply a matter of historical scholarship. For in seeing the Aristotelian continuity in the history of science, we can reject the relativism of those like Kuhn (1970) who see the history of science as a series of incommensurable paradigms; and thus we can restore our confidence in science as a progressive search for the truth about nature. Biological Facts and Moral Norms Some of the commentators challenge my claim that one can "derive moral norms from biological facts." Fortin, Salkever, and Sorenson doubt that this is Aristotle's teaching. I would agree that one cannot "derive" moral conclusions from biology if that means the prescribing of universal rules of action or the determining of moral choices by physical causes. Yet insofar as biology clarifies and deepens our understanding of human nature, biological facts inform (but do not determine) our moral choices, because what is good for us as human beings is the fulfillment of our natural inclinations. We must distin- guish, of course, between physical goodness and moral goodness. As beings capable of rational choice, which is not determined by physical causal- ity, we fulfill our nature through character formation and rational reflection. Engelhardt and Sorenson have questioned my using Sacks' treatment of Ray's Tourette's syn- drome to illustrate the normative character of biol- ogy as applied by a doctor. The end of the medical art, I would insist, is health, which can be under- stood as "the well-working of the organism as a whole" (Kass, 1985:174). The amazing capacity of living beings for self-healing shows nature striving for this as the end that the good doctor must serve. For human beings, health includes psychic as well as somatic wholeness. This is evident in what Sacks (1985:xiv) says about the purpose of his neurological stories: The patient's essential being is very relevant in the higher reaches of neurology, and in psy- chology; for here the patient's personhood is essentially involved, and the study of disease and of identity cannot be disjoined. Such disor- ders, and their depiction and study, indeed entail a new discipline, which we may call the "neurol- ogy of identity," for it deals with the neural foundations of the self, the age-old problem of mind and brain. It is possible that there must, of necessity, be a gulf, a gulf of category, between the psychical and the physical; but studies and stories pertaining simultaneously and insepara- bly to both... may none the less serve to bring them nearer, to bring us to the very intersection of mechanism and life, to the relation of physio- logical processes to biography. We can thus look to biology to investigate "the neural foundations of the self," while still affirming the mind as a nonphysical power irreducible to the neural mechanism. In response to Bluhm, therefore, I would say that Aristotle's account of nous as a nonphysical power does not contradict human biol- ogy. Neurologists like Sperry (1983) and Eccles</page><page sequence="53">225 (1979) would defend a conception of "psychophysi- cal ?nteractionism" remarkably similar to Aristotle's psychology. Furthermore, any Darwinian explanation of the emergence of consciousness must implicitly deny materialist reductionism. The materialist main- tains that consciousness exerts no causal power because it is either an illusion or an impotent side- effect of the neural mechanism. But according to evolutionary theory, consciousness could not have evolved unless it were causally effective in altering the brain and behavior in ways that aided survival and reproduction. Yet even though the human species' nature as the rational animal provides norms for human conduct, those natural norms cannot be translated directly into practical standards for moral and political life. This is clear in Aristotle's handling of slavery and the unequal treatment of women. Bokina and Lopreato assume that since Aristotle did not openly argue for abolishing these practices because they were con- trary to nature, he must have thought them to be natural. Without going through all the relevant tex- tual evidence, I would simply point out that Aristotle never explicitly endorses as natural either slavery as actually practiced or the exclusion of women from full citizenship (Bluhm, 1980; Nichols, 1983; Zuckert, 1983; Ambler, 1987; Levy, 1987). Aristotle's under- standing of the relation between nature and conven- tion is complex. By the norms of natural justice, all political regimes are defective, but any attempt at radical rectification would be disastrous. This sober assessment of the human condition explains why Aristotle was neither a conservative traditionalist nor a revolutionary reformer (Ambler, 1985). Common Sense and Biological Teleology In my article, I have appealed to common sense and I would accept Wiser's suggestion about the worth of Reid's reasoning about common sense in his arguments against skepticism (Reid, 1819:384-98; Reid, 1969:30-41, 593-671; Arnhart, 1981:185-88; Arnhart, 1987:169-73, 178-79, 184-85). I should also mention the work of Jonas (1966, 1984), who has shown how our commonsense experience as en- souled bodies testifies to nature's teleology. As living bodies we have an insider's knowledge of life. We have direct experience through our individual lives of what it is like to be an animal. And since we are just as much a part of nature as any other being, we can accept the personal testimony of our subjective experience as evidence of nature's order. So, for example, our experience as thinking bodies tells us that matter thinks?or at least that matter in some form provides the conditions for thinking?and therefore there can be no absolute separation of mind and matter. And why should we presume that we must explain our mental life in terms applicable to nonthinking matter, rather than reversing the process so that our mental experience would testify to the inherent capacities of matter? We know nature is teleological, because we know we are teleological. We know nature strives to fulfill its purposes, because we know we strive to fulfill our purposes. We know nature longs for completion and wholeness, even if the perfection desired is not fully attainable. We know such transcendent longings are natural, because we know they are ours. To presume, as is done by the scientific material- ist and the existential nihilist, that we cannot infer the purposefulness of nature from the purposeful- ness of human beings implies that we are not natural beings, which would require an absurd dual- ism that neither the materialist nor the nihilist would want to defend. Both the materialist and the nihilist fall into self-refuting positions. Both claim nature is indifferent, empty of purpose, "value-free." Yet both display in their lives the human care for purpose or meaning that manifests the purposefulness of na- ture as the source of beings who can have such care. If nature were completely indifferent, it would not have produced scientists who care about de- fending materialism or existentialists who care about looking into the abyss. ?Larry Arnhart</page><page sequence="54">226 References Adler, M.
