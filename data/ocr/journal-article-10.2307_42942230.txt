Boston: Beacon Press, 1994. 312 pp. $ 27.50. For millennia, rabbinic commentators have averted their eyes when biblical contexts suggest that God might be envisioned, in anthropomor- phic terms, as having the same reproductive anatomical apparatus as the human male. This avoidance signals more than delicacy or propriety, suggests Howard Eilberg-Schwartz in his fascinating new book, God's</page><page sequence="2">Review Essays 165 Phallus . Rather, rabbinic discomfort with the Creator as a phallic male reflects avoidance which is based in the biblical text itself. Unlike the creation narratives of cognate cultures, the Hebrew Bible, with very few exceptions, is almost devoid of language overtly describing God's symbolic loins. Those few passages which do contain such imagery are striking in their isolation; they are the exceptions which prove the rule. Moreover, Eilberg-Schwartz argues, biblical and rabbinic avoidance of such imagery indicates a profound anxiety about its possible homoerotic implications. Averting one's eyes from the loins of the divine father is linked to a similar aversion in dealing with human fathers, the author states. In Genesis, for example, when Noah makes himself drunk on wine after the flood's end and lies in unwitting dishabille, the son who views his besotted father's nakedness with equanimity dishonors his father and himself: the sons who avert their eyes and respectfully cover their drunken father restore his and their own decent humanity. Biblical and rabbinic traditions linked the principles of respectful distance from both human and divine fathers, says Eilberg-Schwartz: "An Israelite male who gazed at God was like Ham, who looked at his naked father. Israelite men were expected to be Semites, virtuous sons of Shem who avert their gaze from their father in heaven" (p. 97). However, when the powerful father or father figure invited a son or servant into a more familiar posture, such a gaze might not be dishonor- ing. A father or master might invite his son or servant to seal an oath by placing a hand under his thigh, for example, without either one of them incurring any dishonor. Similar protocols applied when dealing with the divine father. Only Moses was given permission to speak with God "mouth to mouth" (Num. 12:8), and the rabbinic commentaries link this intimacy between Moses and God with the tradition that he separated himself from conjugal relations with his wife Zipporah. Eilberg-Schwartz reports that in a tangentially related story about the sons of Aaron, Nadav and Avihu, who bring "strange fire" into the holy of holies and are killed by God for doing so (Lev. 10:1-3), the rabbinic commentators recast this episode into a presumptuous and deadly attempt by the young priests to attain intimacy with God while avoiding it with human women. The rabbis state that the two entered the inner sanctum inappropriately clothed and feasted on the sight of the shekhinah (God's spirit, often cast in a feminine guise). The rabbis also suggest that their infatuation with this priestly privilege had interfered with their wedding human brides, as Eilberg-Schwartz quotes the midrash:</page><page sequence="3">166 SHOFAR Fall 1995 Vol. 14, No. 1 Rabbi Levi said, "They were pompous. Many women remained unmarried waiting for them. What did they say? 'Our father's brother is a king, our mother's brother is a prince, our father is a High priest, and we are both deputy High priests; what woman is worthy of us?'" Rabbi Menahma in the name of Rabbi Joshua b. Nehemiah quoted: uFire devoured their young men (Ps. 78:63). Why had fire devoured their young men? Because their virgins had no marriage song (Ps. 78:63). w (LevRab 20:10, p. 192). Thus, according to Eilberg-Schwartz's understanding of the rabbinic text, the rabbis viewed Nadav and Avihu's behavior as a kind of misplaced eroticism. Intimacy was appropriate for Moses, because he interacted with God in response to a divine invitation. For other men, however, such a familiar gaze was received as an attempt to dishonor, and was rewarded with fiery death. Eilberg-Schwartz argues that the anthropomorphic angst of Judaic literature is exacerbated by the fact that from Hosea onward the Jewish people is often pictured in a feminized status; in numerous biblical and post-biblical texts, God is portrayed as the powerful husband and the Jews as his dependent current, estranged, or potential wife. Were Judaic images of God to include reproductive physicality, the Jewish males who were the prime creators and students of rabbinic literature would be put in the uncomfortable position of feeling as though they were the all-too-literal wives of God. The homoerotic implications of this posture would have put pious male readers into an untenable position, since rabbinic law valorized masculine reproductive roles, along with ritual punctiliousness and text study. Eilberg-Schwartz concludes by exploring the personal implications of the texts he has studied. In biblical texts, the viewing of the father's body symbolized intimacy, but such familiarity was appropriate infrequently, and by invitation only. To the author today, the lack of a physical image is linked to physical and emotional remoteness; he says, "I need to imagine a God with a body, with fatherly arms, who does not turn his back away" (p. 239). Rather than picturing a disembodied, all-powerful, spiritualized father, with the inevitable hierarchical comparison with an embodied, dependent mother, he urges the revisioning of a more tender, embodied father, along with a more powerful and volitional mother. The deity might be envisioned with masculine or feminine physical and emotional attributes, without necessarily becoming a tyrannical patriarchal figure or a goddess. Eilberg-Schwartz links this endeavor to "a willingness to see male-male eroticism as an emotionally whole relationship," which to him means "that we recognize the part within ourselves that craves intimate</page><page sequence="4">Review Essays 167 bonds with fathers and other men, though these bonds do not take the form of sexual relationships" (p. 241). Early on in his study, Eilberg-Schwartz discounts biblical images of female reproductive physicality. Supporting his neglect of female imagery by citing those feminist critics who concentrate on the overwhelming maleness of the biblical sacred idiom, Eilberg-Schwartz states that femininity "is more or less excluded from the divine realm" (p. 21). Later, he refers briefly to the startlingly graphic female God-imagery of passages such as those in Isaiah, which envision God as a woman who conceives, gestates, gives birth, and nurses her offspring despite graying hair (Isaiah 46:3-4), and to the explications of Phyllis Trible and others of these passages (pp. 114-116). I believe that the author would have done well to devote more space to such imagery, and would, in the process, have strengthened his argument, since no such vivid reproductive particularism is found in biblical literature about God the father. God's Phallus is an important chapter in the ongoing effort to reveal the implications of rabbinic discomfort with the full spectrum of male sexuality. Eilberg-Schwartz suggests that discomfort with male homoerotic potential may have interfered with the spiritual and emotional ties between Jewish men and their fathers. Discomfort with heteroerotic impulses was also the source of great anxiety, producing a complex structure of rabbinic laws restricting the behavior of women. Whatever about women might make men aware of their own sexual impulses was relegated to a realm out of sight and, hopefully, out of mind. The impact of such isolation on the physical, spiritual, and emotional lives of women was seldom considered as rabbinic restrictions were being designed and implemented. Moreover, the lives of men were inexorably impoverished by their enforced distance from the female half of their people. Had Eilberg-Schwartz chosen to incorporate the impact of male sexual anxiety upon both genders, his study would have been richer and more complete. Nonetheless, his analysis is without doubt a very significant piece of work, and will change forever the way people look at biblical texts.</page></plain_text>
