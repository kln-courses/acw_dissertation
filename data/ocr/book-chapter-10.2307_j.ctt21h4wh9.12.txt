<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 8GEORGE STEINER  ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY Th e essay below is tribute to a classic in Russian literary criticism written in the “Old  Style,” a little battered but still robust: “Tolstoy and Dostoevsky: Seductions of the Old  Criticism” [a retrospective essay on George Steiner’s Tolstoy or Dostoevsky (1959)], in  Reading George Steiner, ed. by Ronald A. Sharp and Nathan A. Scott, Jr. (Baltimore:  Johns Hopkins University Press, 1994), 74–98. In this essay too, one feels the Gasparov-Bakhtin divide between “philosophers and  philologists.” As in the fracas over “Tatiana,” there are traces of Russian versus Western  ways of reading the classics. In editing this essay for republication, I expanded somewhat  on Steiner’s contribution to the Tolstoy-versus-Shakespeare wars. Th ose wars (with a focus  on the part played by George Bernard Shaw during the last six years of Tolstoy’s life)  were a major scholarly preoccupation of mine during the Tolstoy Centenary year, 2010. TOLSTOY AND DOSTOEVSKY:  SEDUCTIONS OF THE OLD CRITICISM 1994 A Tribute to George Steiner George Steiner wrote his major contribution to Russian literary studies,  Tolstoy or Dostoevsky: An Essay in the Old Criticism, in the late 1950s.1 At the  time, academic critics in the West felt much closer to nineteenth-century  Russian culture than to any literary product of that forbidding and well- sealed monolith, the Soviet state — even though, paradoxically, our regnant  1 Th e book was fi rst published in 1959.

GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- New Criticism recalled in many particulars the spirit of Russian Formalism  from the Soviet 1920s. Now over thirty years old, Tolstoy or Dostoevsky still  renders useful service to those two great Russian novelists. But the book  casts unexpected light on our own current critical debates as well. Steiner opens his essay with a defense of his “old” critical approach.  Its primary purpose, he tells us, is to serve the text “subjectively.” Th us  its starting point must be a positive, almost an electrical, contact between  an artwork of genius and its admiring and energized reader. In Steiner’s  words, “when the work of art invades our consciousness, something within  us catches fl ame. What we do thereafter is to refi ne and make articulate  the original leap of recognition” (45). Th is quasi-mystical mission — which  only Steiner’s great erudition and good taste could bring down to earth in  our suspicious, secular age — is then pointedly contrasted with the spirit of  the New Criticism; “Quizzical, captious, immensely aware of its philosophic  ancestry and complex instruments, it often comes to bury rather than to  praise” (4). In retrospect Steiner is perhaps too harsh on the New Critics,  whose captiousness is but a minnow to the leviathan of later postmodernist  burials of the world’s great literature. Still, he sees ample evidence of a falling  away from earlier, more radiant modes of reading. Th e unhappy vogue of  “objective criticism,” he claims, has made us uncertain of our great books and  suspicious of tradition. “We grow wary of our inheritance,” he writes. “We  have become relativists” (4). Why relativism in one’s literary relations should be a sin or a shame is  not spelled out, but Steiner’s basic position is clear: he defends the literary  canon and the reader’s unmediated primary contact with it. As Real Presences  indicates, this commitment has not changed. But what, precisely, is primary  contact? It does not have to mean immersion in the native language of the  literary text (in his dealings with Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, Steiner apologizes  for his ignorance of Russian, although it hampers him little in the texts he  discusses); nor does it mandate a meticulous, insider’s knowledge of the  political or cultural background of every world-class text. Primary contact, for  Steiner, is both more modest and more risk-laden. It requires from the reader  less an intellectual than an aesthetic commitment, a willingness to “tune  oneself” to the artwork and thus to become part of the text’s glorious problem  rather than its solution. In short, we come into primary contact when, one way  or another, we fall in love with a piece of art and are moved to expand on its  value in ways that expose our own vulnerabilities before it. “Literary criticism  should arise out of a debt of love,” Steiner writes (3). From this primary love  relation, apparently, there are no merely scientifi c or “secondary” ways out. — 193 — </page> <page sequence="3"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ In our current climate of interrogating texts and their authors, all this  sounds very, very old. But what takes us by surprise, in rereading Tolstoy or  Dostoevsky, is its high degree of theoretical sophistication. Th e number of  potent critical ideas that Steiner eases directly out of primary texts (and it  goes without saying that Russian scholarship has a vast “secondary” industry  on each of these novelists, but Steiner is not, and cannot be, indebted to it)  is exhilarating. His resulting thesis is so intelligently cobbled together from  the bottom up, out of the wide-ranging and integral worldviews of the novels  themselves, that it easily survives the language barrier and the passage of  time. To reconstruct and extend that thirty-year-old thesis, with an eye to  some intervening critical developments, will be the major task of this essay. § Steiner’s thesis, anchored fi rmly in the ancient world, can be summed up  in a topic sentence. Tolstoy’s art revives the traditions of Homeric epic,  whereas Dostoevsky’s art reenacts, in novelistic garb, Greek tragic drama.  One is immediately struck, of course, by the derivative nature of the whole  dichotomy — by its apparent indiff erence to the manifest “novelness” of  the novel, which has been justly celebrated as the most non-Aristotelian  of genres. Many have argued that the novel’s messiness and potential  indeterminacy were precisely what appealed to these two Russian innovators  in the genre. Th is intractable failure of the great Russian novel to fi t into  a classical poetics led the twentieth century’s greatest student of Dostoevsky,  Mikhail Bakhtin, to posit the novel as a genre that is in principle opposed  to both epic and drama. Th is dialogue between Bakhtin and Steiner, so  suggestive and full of intricate complementarity, shall be pursued at the end  of the essay. Let us fi rst turn fi rst to the general lineaments of Steiner’s  juxtaposition of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky. Chapter One sets the scene by marking similarities. Both novelists wrote  immensely long books. But, Steiner notes, the length of these books was  of a diff erent order than the length, say, of Clarissa or Ulysses; for those  latter authors, length was an invitation to elegant and precise mapping, to  tying down, whereas for Dostoevsky and Tolstoy, “plenitude was an essential  freedom” (14). Freedom and plenitude: out of these two ideas Steiner  constructs his larger contribution to the history of the novel. Much ink has  been spilt on comparisons between the “European” and “Russian” novel,  Steiner remarks. But the more interesting and valid comparison is between  — 194 — </page> <page sequence="4"> ----------------------------------- 8. GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- the European novel, on the one hand, and on the other the Russian and the  American novel — two generic strands fused, as it were, at the still half-savage  periphery of Europe’s sphere of infl uence. Steiner explains his typology. Th e  European novel, he argues, arose as a private genre that was secular, rational,  social. Its task was the successful portrayal of everyday life. But the genre  was plagued from the start with a question of legitimacy: could the prosaic  and quotidian ever attain to the “high seriousness” expected of great art?  Th e grand novels of the Romantic period were spared the full implications of  that question, because Dickens, Hugo, Stendhal could abandon the familiar  plots of classical antiquity and draw, for inspiration and grandeur, on the  heroic (but still contemporary and local) events of the 1810s-40s, on the  Napoleonic theme and its aftermath. Th e problem became more serious  in the second half of the century, Steiner notes, when the mainstream  European novel — tacking to and fro in search of a new word — confronted  the pervasive, leveling “bourgeoisifi cation” of everyday life. As a genre  devoted to secular readings of ordinary experience, its predictable endpoint  was Zola’s desiccating naturalism and Flaubert’s catalogue manqué. According to Steiner, this “dilemma of realism” was felt less acutely at  the periphery of the novel’s reach. “Th e masters of the American and the  Russian manner appear to gather something of their fi erce intensity from the  outer darkness,” he writes, “from the decayed matter of folklore, melodrama,  and religious life” (30). Melville and Hawthorne are the American States’  Dostoevsky: writers on an untamed frontier, creating their narratives in  isolation, plagued by crises of faith in their pre-Enlightenment societies, and  radically insecure in the face of Europe’s complacent cultural superiority.  Russian and American novelists had no trouble fi lling their novels with “high  seriousness” and at the same time claiming “exceptionalist” status. Having  established the special compatibility of these two quasi-civilized European  outposts, Steiner then returns to the classics — and shows how the Russian  novel became the salvation of that profoundly civilized legacy. Steiner’s book falls into two parts, each with its own thesis and  demonstration: Tolstoy as Homeric bard, Dostoevsky as tragic dramatist. For  a critic such as Steiner, uninterested in such hypotheses as the death of the  author or the impossibility of authorial intention, the fi rst thesis is the easier  to document. Tolstoy himself desired to be compared with Homer. Indeed,  we sense intuitively that Tolstoy’s novels have some kinship with epic: in  their immensity, seriousness, spaciousness, in the serene confi dence of their  narrative voice. But certain other parallels have been neglected, Steiner  claims. Th e most crucial of these are Tolstoy’s specifi c structural imitations  — 195 — </page> <page sequence="5"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ of Homeric epic, and the concordance between Tolstoy’s epic manner and  his anarchic Christianity (which Steiner will later bring unnervingly close  to paganism, to an anthropomorphic “theology without God” [266]). In  a leisurely and learned manner Steiner constantly weaves scenes from the  Odyssey and Iliad into his own paraphrases of Tolstoyan plot and doctrine.  A welcome byproduct of these subtle penetrations is Steiner’s continual  reassurance that Tolstoy’s novels are not unworked “slices of life,” not the  fl uid puddings or baggy monsters that Henry James christened them, for  no one would deny an epic poem the status of real (not naively realistic) art.  If the great Russian novel little resembled its European counterpart, it was  not because Russian novelists had no interest in craft; it was because the  craft of these Russians was unreadable in the context of the Romantic or  naturalistic Continental novel (49–58). Classicists might balk at Steiner’s bold, homogenizing defi nition of the  “epic vision.” But, as Steiner gradually sculpts this vision to fi t his thesis  about Russian writers, Tolstoy’s novels take on an integrity — both artistic  and theoretical — that their bulk and their sprawl of detail usually defy.  Invoking as foil and counterexample the negated, manipulative world of  Madame Bovary, which stuns us with its cold and perfect distance, Steiner  dwells on the deeply epic refl exes of Tolstoyan novelistic prose: the sensuous,  dynamic, personal energy that physical objects continually absorb from their  human context, keeping them warm (“Th e sword is always seen as part of  the striking arm” [51]). Epic is also sensed in the frequent elevation of tiny  realistic detail to a matter of passionate signifi cance, and in the utter lack  of sentimentality about death or individual tragedy (“War and mortality cry  havoc in the Homeric and Tolstoyan worlds, but the centre holds. . . . ‘Keep your  eyes steadfastly to the light,’ says Tolstoy, ‘this is how things are’” [78, 77]). Of great and disorienting importance in the Tolstoyan vision is the  eff ective absence of God. Steiner devotes part of chapter four to this seeming  paradox: a deeply religious thinker who constructs his Christian theology  without the Church, and his Christ without a heavenly Father.2 A partial  answer might be found, again, in the Homeric model. Tolstoy is a pagan,  2 In his discussion of Tolstoy’s religious beliefs, Steiner presciently notes what later  specialists have amply documented, that despite Tolstoy’s much-advertised “conversion”  of 1881–82, continuity rather than break was the norm: “Actually, most of the ideas  and beliefs expounded by the later Tolstoy appear in his earliest writings and the live  substance of his morality was plainly discernible during the years of apprenticeship”  (242). For a comprehensive exposition of this continuity thesis, see Richard F. Gustafson,  Leo Tolstoy: Resident and Stranger (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1986). — 196 — </page> <page sequence="6"> ----------------------------------- 8. GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- Steiner insists, of the most sophisticated and ethically responsible sort.  Within such a world view, neither confession as a sacrament nor faith in  a miracle-working savior can remedy human error; error is righted only  through something akin to stoic resolve, changing one’s life as a result  of painful contemplation or movements of an isolated conscience. We  should not be misled by the superfi cial frivolity of the Greek gods and their  irresponsible antics on and off  Mount Olympus. Th e continuum of Homer’s  world — its ultra-heroism for human beings and its semi-divinity for  gods — suggests precisely the sort of leveling of the secular and the divine  that we would expect from the author of a treatise entitled Th e Kingdom of  God Is within You. Steiner is alert, of course, to those aspects of the epic that do not match  up with Tolstoyan values. He notes, for example, that the ethic of Tolstoy  is profoundly antiheroic (80) and that his later pacifi st self would never  have approved (although it always deeply understood) the epic lust of the  battlefi eld. However, the world views of Tolstoy and the epic do share one  vital quasi-religious dimension: “Th e humanity of the gods signifi es that  reality — the controlling pivot of man’s experience —  is immanent in the  natural world” (267). Th roughout Steiner’s argument, the novel appears to be the tenor of  the metaphor, cast in a passive or imitative holding pattern, while the epic  is the more active defi ning vehicle. But in one fi nal comparison, Steiner  makes an impressive contribution precisely to understanding the novel as  a genre. Th is is his discussion, in chapter Two, of the “double and triple plot  structure” of epics and of Tolstoyan narratives. Steiner does not probe the  formal implications of this structure for Tolstoy’s larger ethical vision — for  that one must repair to Gary Saul Morson’s splendid monograph on War  and Peace3 — but he does make numerous acute observations that assist the  reader in integrating this baffl  ing mega-narrative. Steiner acknowledges that multiple plot structure in the epic lends it  narrative grandeur, scope, and disinterestedness. He also discerns that  Tolstoy employs such multiplicity for very special purposes. (On the master  list of talents Tolstoy commands as novelist, disinterestedness must rank  rather low.) “Double vision” and double plots can be polemical, of course,  in the overtly didactic sense: they can reinforce and generalize a particular  instance (thus making it more authoritative), or they can ironize and  3 Gary Saul Morson. Hidden in Plain View: Narrative and Creative Potentials in “War and  Peace” (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1987). — 197 — </page> <page sequence="7"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ undercut an instance, trivializing the original statement, as well as later  parodic replays of it. Although Tolstoy is surely no stranger to this kind of  didacticism, Steiner suggests a third possibility: that multiple vision, in the  form of many blunt-edged and competing plot lines, can be deployed purely  to thicken the texture of the work, “to suggest realness by making the design  of a work dense, jagged, and complex” (98). So far, no surprises. But Steiner then stresses that the purpose here is  not to saturate the novel with realia for its own sake, nor to despise — in the  name of some brute realism — the author’s obligation to structure a coherent  story. He points out, correctly, that Tolstoy’s plots incorporate every bit as  much artifi ce and coincidence as the jerrybuilt, crisis-driven adventure plots  of Dostoevsky. However, the mesh of narrative strands in Tolstoy is so dense,  and the degree of “humanization” that even the most episodic characters  receive is so high and precise, that coincidence and artifi ce do not shock us.  With that much living material, it seems only natural that a great deal of it  will interact. Steiner then speculates on the connection between this thickening of  texture in Tolstoy’s novels and the nature of Tolstoyan closure. Th e mass of  meticulously tended plot lines and the open, often unresolved endings of the  great novels prompt Steiner to regard length, complex plotting, and multiple  vision as a “stringent test” for the “aliveness” of a character: “whether or not  it can grow with time and preserve its coherent individuality in an altered  setting” (104). In this insight — which will not be the last such curious  overlay — we see the germ of the Steiner-Bakhtin debate. At base are their  deeply incompatible notions of the potential of epic. For Bakhtin, the epic  hero is defi ned as a closed and ready-made character who fi ts neatly into  a prescribed plot with no slack or superfl uity. Bakhtin’s novelistic hero, by  contrast, is a character in whom “there always remains an unrealized surplus  of humanness, there always remains a need for the future and a place for this  future must be found.”4 What Steiner does, then, is to graft on to his epic  model a novelistic sensibility that undoes some of Bakhtin’s most famous  dichotomies. In the current theoretical climate that has turned so many  Bakhtinian terms into banal mental refl exes, this revision is provocative.  Th rough it, Steiner proves himself as strong a reader of Tolstoy as Bakhtin  was a weak one. 4 Mikhail Bakhtin, “Epic and Novel,” in Th e Dialogic Imagination: Four Essays by  M. M. Bakhtin, ed.

GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- § As a bridge to his second major theme, Dostoevsky as tragic dramatist,  Steiner discusses Tolstoy and the drama — and specifi cally the most scandal- ridden corner of that topic, Tolstoy and Shakespeare. Tolstoy’s vitriolic  1903 essay “On Shakespeare and on Drama” opens with a caricature of the  plot of King Lear. It then condemns as unworthy of human intelligence all  Elizabethan theatrical convention, judging Shakespearean language a tedious  pomposity and the Bard an ungifted scribbler. Th e treatise has long been  assigned to that category of eccentricity permitted great writers. Steiner,  however, takes Tolstoy’s essay more seriously. For one thing, it contains  a lengthy passage praising Homer (for seriousness and detached narrative  voice) at Shakespeare’s expense; this broadside appeals to Steiner, for he sees  in Tolstoy’s gravitation toward epic, with its commitment to a “totality of  objects,” a lodestar of Tolstoyan aesthetics. Second, Steiner correctly stresses  that Tolstoy’s writings on drama are not the ravings of a man who rejected or  misunderstood the stage. Tolstoy was an excellent and eff ective playwright.  He rejects not drama itself, but only what he perceives as Shakespeare’s  inability to produce on stage the right sort of illusion. Accordingly, Steiner deals with Tolstoy’s rejection of Shakespeare in  terms of “two diff erent types of illusion.” Th e fi rst type is straightforwardly  false (the seduction of Natasha at the opera in War and Peace); the second  type Steiner refers to, unsatisfyingly, as “some undefi ned notion of ‘true  illusion’” (122). Steiner’s argument would have benefi ted from consideration  of a key text on aesthetics that Tolstoy wrote fi ve years before the essay on  Shakespeare. For the Tolstoyan paradox of a “true illusion” is not at all  “undefi ned”  but the  bedrock at the base of Tolstoy’s earlier treatise, the  1898 What Is Art? What is Art, and why does Shakespeare fail at it? In his attempt to answer  the question posed by his title, Tolstoy avoids the simple binary opposition  “true-false.” With his passion for inventories and lists, he constructs a much  more interesting evaluative model of (at least) two axes. Along the fi rst axis,  an artwork can be true or counterfeit. If counterfeit, the art simply won’t  “take,” that is, it will be defi cient in aesthetic eff ect. If true, we enter more  dangerous territory, for the artwork can be good (moral) or bad (immoral).  According to Tolstoy, true art (presumably both moral and immoral) must  satisfy three criteria: it must be lucid, sincere, and non-derivative (“particular,”  that is, the result of an emotion really experienced by the artist creating it).  Th ese three traits bring on the “infection” of the reader and/or spectator by  — 199 — </page> <page sequence="9"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ the emotion the author underwent during the act of creation. Th e resultant  communication — in essence an act of solidarity between artist (infector)  and audience (infectee) — constitutes the mission and justifi cation of art. But  artists can have genuinely bad feelings, and people can be genuinely infected  by bad art. Th is is one paradox of What Is Art?. Another is that Tolstoy never  answers his own question. He does not even tell us how art is made, but only  what it is supposed to do, its eff ect on the audience. As a superb practicing  artist, Tolstoy knew that the work of creation was internal and inexplicable;  he avoids discussing the craft required of the artist. Rather, he resolves the  dilemma of counterfeit, immoral, but universally celebrated art by appealing  to a dynamic as patho-somatic as the idea of infection itself, namely: mass  “hypnosis,” the baleful infl uence of fashionable critics and ugly vogue. Here the problem of Shakespeare becomes acute. For Tolstoy insists  that Shakespeare’s plays are both counterfeit and bad. Counterfeit because  derivative, at every point worse than their literary prototypes, poorly  motivated, created by and for actors (that is not a compliment), and — unlike  Homeric epic — the work of an insincere author who “does not believe  in what he is saying.” Tolstoy never made his peace with Shakespeare’s  skill at representing many diff erent points of view, many diff erent moral  positions, with equal eloquence and persuasiveness. How can a playwright  be sincere if he bestows upon all parties, even the evil and corrupted, the  same loving form? But these “counterfeit” plays are also bad immoral art:  tempting spectators with crooked or obscene plots, trivial ideas, deceptive  language. Tolstoy is not the fi rst serious voice in the international world of  letters to raise objections against the Bard, of course. Criticism has been  fulsome from Samuel Johnson (who also bristled at King Lear) through Pope,  Voltaire, Orwell and Bernard Shaw. But arguably no world-class writer has  ever allowed himself a condemnation of Shakespeare that is as selective,  self-righteous, self-serving and breezily inaccurate, as Leo Tolstoy’s. Th e  sophisticated, thoroughly aesthetic Steiner is curiously forgiving of it, both  in his Tolstoy or Dostoevsky from 1956 and — thirty years later — in his  W. P. Ker Lecture “A Reading against Shakespeare.” As Steiner put the case  in that later lecture: Himself a supreme creator of animate form and a playwright of considerable  power, Tolstoy found much of Shakespearean drama puerile in its  sentiments, amoral in its fundamental worldview, rhetorically overblown  and often insufferable to adult reason . . . Much would be worth saying about  Tolstoy’s ascetic, puritanical realism; about his almost instinctive loathing  — 200 — </page> <page sequence="10"> ----------------------------------- 8. GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- of ‘make-believe’; about the secret, subconscious rage he may have felt in  the face of Shakespeare’s creation of Lear . . . Nevertheless, even after the  inference of psychological motive and ideological myopia, there are points  worth careful notice.5 Steiner does not detail those things “worth saying” about Tolstoy’s prejudices  as a reader of Shakespeare — perhaps because Steiner, like Tolstoy, is a strong  critic. Strong critics all crave “careful notice” for their unorthodox opinions.  Also, what Steiner appreciates in Tolstoy’s treatise might be what Bernard  Shaw also applauded, its rage against the cult of Shakespeare, adulation  kept alive by cultural inertia. While others are too cowed to question literary  reputation, Tolstoy confronts it head on. If Shakespearean drama is both  counterfeit and bad (as Tolstoy has proved it is), how did “infection” occur?  How did the entire European 19th century collapse into idolatry before this  false playwright? Tolstoy’s answer: that the popular press, helped by the  mental sloth of the public, has perpetrated a hoax, an “epidemic suggestion”  [vnushenie, lit. “infi ltration”] concerning Shakespeare’s writerly worth. People  have fallen for it the way an unsuspecting subject falls helpless under hypnosis.6  Tolstoy argues his case without humor. It is hard to imagine any iconoclast  more dismissive of the legitimacy of an opinion diff ering from his own. Steiner, perhaps out of strong-critic solidarity and perhaps out of a sense  that the world at large is indeed a drugged place, will not call Tolstoy on this  improbable explanation of Shakespeare’s enduring fame. Th at Steiner does  not do so is fascinating, given his anxiety over the encroaching “relativity” in  literary relations, his insistence that we love our literary inheritance rather than  suspiciously interrogate it, and his solidly old-fashioned defense of the canon  in which Shakespeare has such pride of place. Yet Steiner must have sensed the  punitive element in Tolstoy’s essay, written not to explicate Shakespeare but to  expose and discredit those who delight in him or learn from him. In his treatise,  with full disclosure of the reasons why, Tolstoy focuses on the eff ect of art’s  5 “A Reading against Shakespeare”(Th e W. P. Ker Lecture, 1986), repr. in George Steiner,  No Passion Spent. Essays 1978–1995 (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1996), 108–28,  esp. 113. 6 As the argument appears in the fi rst English-language edition of Tolstoy’s essay: “Th ere is  only one explanation of this wondrous fame: it is one of those ‘epidemic suggestions’ to  which people are constantly subject, startling in its deceitful infl uence and senselessness,  such as faith in witches, the utility of torture for the discovery of the truth, the search  for the elixir of life or the philosopher’s stone, the passion for tulips that suddenly seized  Holland ...” Leo Tolstoy, “Tolstoy on Shakespeare,” transl. V. Tchertkoff  (New York and  London: Funk and Wagnalls, 1906), 97. — 201 — </page> <page sequence="11"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ message on the audience. But he does so with utter disdain for the dramatic  conventions that might govern the reactions of an audience — conventions  that permit the art work to “speak” emotionally, authentically and without  mediation to spectators in its own time. He is equally disdainful of all who  might be curious to co-experience that unmediated reaction, and to learn its  lessons, by reproducing those conventions at a later time. A glance at Tolstoy’s letters and diaries will document this insistent  preoccupation with “counterfeit reception,” understood by him as the  unacceptable fact that others fi nd real what he fi nds false. As Tolstoy  wrote to Vladimir Stasov, a confederate in the Realist cause, in October  1903, the trouble with Shakespeare was not his aristocratism as much as  “the perversion of aesthetic taste brought about by the praise of unartistic  works.” And then he continues: “Well, let them abuse me if they like. Perhaps  you will too, but I had to express what has been cooped up in me for half  a century. Forgive me.”7 As always, Tolstoy’s transparency — his awareness  of his own violently personal response to art and his readiness to assume  full responsibility for his subjective views (that is, not to lob them off  as  scientifi c method) — coexists with his deep need to believe in common moral  denominators and the possibility of human unity. Th ere is much that Steiner  might have mined in this passion of Tolstoy’s to unmask Shakespearean  drama on behalf of the world’s aesthetic health.8 But on this topic Steiner,  strong critic, keeps his eyes perhaps too steadfastly to the light of his thesis  about Tolstoy as the clear-seeing epic bard. Th ree decades later, the author  of Real Presences would have in Tolstoy a perfect candidate for his “republic  of primary things,” that hypothetical city from which all non-creating critics  are banished. But the nineteenth century’s greatest creative Naysayer would  have kept his distance. § If Tolstoy’s understanding of the drama was ineluctably tied to a single voice  with the authority of an epic narrator, then Dostoevsky represents for Steiner  the opposite case: a novelist who looked to drama, and specifi cally to tragic  drama, for both the structure and the spiritual focus of his novelistic world.  7 Leo Tolstoy to V.

Translation adjusted. 8 Th e thinness of Tolstoy’s argument is clear in this crude form, but it is sobering to see  how his idea (on the baleful infl uence of fashionable critics and vogue) has resurfaced  in current politicized theories of literary value. — 202 — </page> <page sequence="12"> ----------------------------------- 8. GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- Steiner begins chapter three with a most useful account of the nineteenth- century eclipse of tragic form. Music, that darling of the Romantics, had  accomplished less than had been hoped in the narrative arts; the stage had  been captured by popular melodrama and vaudeville. Th e “tragic vision” was  thus picked up and perfected by Melville and Dostoevsky. What does genuine drama require? In approaching this question, Steiner  is both helped and hobbled by his reluctance to attend to specifi c requirements  (or, for that matter, even simple defi nitions) of the novel as a genre. Th e  essence of drama, for Steiner, is concentration, compression, “moments”: all  aff ects piled into a mass confrontation, where it is imperative that “speech  should move and motion speak” (163). In Steiner’s view, however, this  highly controlled and often stylized nature of drama does not in the least  restrict its freedom of meaning, nor reduce it to cliché. Th is fact is of crucial  importance for Steiner’s next move, which is to attach to tragic drama, as  a resolute genre attribute, what many critics (again, most famously Bakhtin)  have considered the central achievement of the Dostoevskian polyphonic  novel: the power to invest heroes and plots with genuinely free potential. As  Steiner puts his thesis, “Dostoevsky, like all genuine dramatists, seemed to  listen with an inward ear to the independent and unforeseeable dynamics of  action . . . [Th us] the characters seem admirably free from their creator’s will  and our own previsions” (173). For Steiner, then, the “law of composition” in a Dostoevskian novel  is dramatic in the sense that it is “one of maximum energy, released over  the smallest possible extent of space and time” (147). But this energy and  compression are so volatile, so chemically unstable that the playwright  cannot hope to do more than set up the scene and then stand back. Th us  genuinely dramatic scenes always convey the sense that “things could be  otherwise” (unlike, in Steiner’s control case, the absolute determinedness of  human action in the novels of Henry James). “Th e tightness, the high pitch  of drama,” Steiner writes, “are brought on by the interplay of ambiguous  meanings, of partial ignorance with partial insight” (277). To be dramatic in  Steiner’s sense is not to be tied to specifi c unities, speech styles, or roles, but  to be ever uncertain how the scene will end. So much, then, for dramatic character in Dostoevsky, which is indeed  saturated with polyphonic novelness. What about dramatic plot? At this  point in chapter three, Steiner treats us to some European literary history  (one of many such treats in the book) on a topic too often overlooked by  Russianists. Steiner wishes to defend Dostoevsky’s plots. Th ese plots have  taken a beating, both in their own and in our century — for their exaggerated  — 203 — </page> <page sequence="13"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ pathos, their perversity, and for their apparent incompatibility with the  sophisticated moral philosophy that Dostoevsky weaves around them in his  novels. Th e extremism of these stories encourages critics (especially of the  psychoanalytic persuasion) to seek in the personal psychology of their creator  some abnormal pathological core. But Steiner advises us to read Dostoevsky  the Creator against the background of his century, not our own. Th e 1950s  readership dismisses much of Dostoevskian thematics as low culture, as  kitsch, or (in an alternative coping mechanism) fi nds it so repellent that we  prefer to analyze it as a matter of “private obsession” (201). But violence  against children, seduction of virgins, murder over mysterious inheritances,  and the related landscapes of eroticism, terror, and sadism were “the public  material at hand” — that is, the set plots available to any European novelist,  so familiar as to be almost invisible. Th is material was the indiff erent, indeed  the clichéd stock in trade of gothic melodrama and the grotesque. Th e fact  that Dostoevsky considered the crude but complex conventions of these  genres — which fl ooded the popular stage as well as the popular novel — to be  acceptable material for high art provided him with a matchless opportunity.  He could write bestsellers that compromised nothing in intellectual rigor;  and he could resurrect tragic drama on the basis of forms that were already  part of the reading public’s most basic literacy, namely, the gothic romance. Steiner argues this case with skill. What reservations one has about  his thesis arise on diff erent and prior ground, back at the point where the  graft between drama and novel was originally joined. To take one example:  in defense of his drama/novel analogy, Steiner notes at one point that  “with each year, the list of dramatic adaptations of Dostoevskian novels  grows longer. During the winter of 1956–57 alone, nine ‘Dostoevsky plays’  were being performed in Moscow” (141). What Steiner does not note — in  addition to the fact that Dostoevsky’s big novels, on page and stage, had  been largely taboo in Russia between the Revolution and the death of  Stalin — is that almost all the stage dramatizations of Dostoevsky’s novels  were bleached-out and bad. Th is badness is not due to any lack of talent on  the part of the playwrights; Albert Camus’s Les Possédés, a dramatization of  Dostoevsky’s massive novel-satire on revolutionary morality, Th e Devils, is  clearly the work of an earnest, gifted writer.9 It is simply that everything  9 In his “Preface” to the play, Camus reinforces much of the Steiner thesis: “For almost  twenty years . . . I have visualized its characters on the stage. Besides having the stature  of dramatic characters, they have the appropriate behavior, the explosions, the swift and  disconcerting gait. Moreover, Dostoevsky uses another technique in his novels: he works  through dialogues with few indications as to place and action . . .  And yet I am well aware  — 204 — </page> <page sequence="14"> ----------------------------------- 8. GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- “Dostoevskian” — except for the melodramatic, Gothic skeleton of the  plot — disappears. In itself this is no bad thing, of course: adaptations need not imitate  their parent texts. But the derived text must have its own vision and succeed  on its own new terms. In this regard the dramatizations of Dostoevsky — at  least the ones with which I am familiar — fail more routinely and more  miserably than do most such projects. Th is failure must at least partly be  due to the temptation to extract that tragic-dramatic core that Steiner so  clearly sees — to strip the novel of all that had obscured its originary scenic  composition — and then to stop there. Th e inadequate result is instructive,  for the diff erence between original and stage adaptation is a measure of the  crucial non-coincidence between the private, innerly realized world of the  novel (at least the novel of ideas) and the publicly performed world of drama.  Dostoevsky may think through his plots as a dramatist, but he uses words,  and his characters use words, as would a novelist. As Bakhtin has argued this  case, “drama is by its very nature alien to genuine polyphony: drama may be  multi-leveled, but it cannot contain multiple worlds; it permits only one, and  not several, systems of measurement.”10 Near the end of chapter four, Steiner gives us one of those bold and  lapidary juxtapositions that are his trademark. In what he engagingly calls  “a myth of criticism, a fancy through which to re-direct our imaginings,”  he proposes “to read the Legend of the Grand Inquisitor as an allegory of  the confrontation between Dostoevsky and Tolstoy” (328). Th ere is much  to recommend the exercise. Th e Inquisitor’s indictment of Christ as carrier  of “all that is exceptional, vague and enigmatic” is indeed Tolstoy’s problem  with the New Testament — and Tolstoy would like to replace its heady  visions and parables with “thorough, unhesitating common sense” (337).  Steiner does not take up the obvious counter-argument, that the Inquisitor  corrects Christ’s work with the triad “miracle, mystery, authority” (which  Tolstoy rejects out of hand), but never mind: in the tough old Cardinal there  of all that separates the play from that amazing novel. I merely tried to follow the book’s  undercurrent and to proceed as it does from satiric comedy to drama and then to tragedy.  Both the original and the dramatic adaptation start from a certain realism and end up in  tragic stylization.” For an English version, see Albert Camus, Th e Possessed: A Play, trans.  Justin O’Brien (New York: Vintage Books, 1960). 10 Mikhail Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics, trans. Caryl Emerson (Minneapolis:  University of Minnesota Press, 1984): 34. Later Bakhtin expands on the implications  for stage performance: double-voiced language of the sort we get in dialogic novels “is  diffi  cult to speak aloud, for loud and living intonation excessively monologizes discourse  and cannot do justice to the other person’s voice present in it” (198). — 205 — </page> <page sequence="15"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ is not a drop of genuine humility or piety, and this is the point Steiner is  resolved to make about that sophisticated pagan aristocrat, Leo Tolstoy.  Dostoevsky, throughout his life passionately undecided about the nature  of moral choice and deeply convinced that “no system of belief, however  compelling, could confer immunity from guilt, doubt, or self-contempt,”11  remained ever willing to take a chance on genuine mystery. In the blunt contours of this Dostoevsky-Tolstoy comparison, Steiner  is certainly correct. Many students of the two novelists have elaborated  this diff erence before and since, but one eloquent variant on the thesis can  serve us as summary. In 1929, Prince D. S. Mirsky, the great Russian literary  historian and critic, then an émigré in England, observed that the problem  of Tolstoy was indeed complicated — but, he added, I do not imply that he was a particularly complex character, there was no  very great variety of ingredients to his personality. He cannot in this sense  be compared to Rousseau, to Goethe, to Pushkin, or to Gogol. He was one  of the most simply composed of great men . . . His mind was essentially  dialectical, in the Hegelian sense . . . But unlike Hegel’s system, Tolstoy’s  mind did not surmount the contradiction of “thesis” and “antithesis”  by any synthesis. Instead of Hegel’s “triads,” Tolstoy was all arranged in  a small number of irreducible and intensely hostile “dyads” . . .  Dualism is  the hallmark of the ethical man. The essence of ethics is a dualistic pattern,  an irreducible opposition between right and wrong or good and evil. As  soon as a third element is introduced, as soon as anything one is allowed  to stand above good and evil, the ethical point of view is adulterated and  ultimately lost.12 Perhaps here, through Mirsky’s controversial judgment over Tolstoy, we  can integrate the various contradictory genre traits that Steiner sees in his  two great subjects. Th e Tolstoyan novel, for all its expansiveness and intricate  multiplicity, is “unitary” in the way the Manichean universe is unitary. Th us  its epic narrator, albeit often subtle in judgments of right and wrong, tends  to keep the audience in awe of higher-order meanings and does not invite  its new or uncontrolled synthesis. In contrast, the Dostoevskian novel — for  all its compression and ideologically precise juxtapositions — continually  11 Th e phrase is Aileen Kelly’s.

GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- gives rise to genuinely new confusions. In Steiner’s terms, Dostoevsky’s art  is open-ended dramatic confl ict, with only the most minimal interference  from authorial stage directions. § How viable is Steiner’s thesis today? What is the feel of this classic essay amid  the comings and goings of current theory and criticism? What strikes us fi rst  about Tolstoy or Dostoevsky is how wonderfully it is written. For cadence and  complex poetry of style, perhaps its only competition in Russian studies is  the highly personal prose of Isaiah Berlin. It is a truism — and, like most  truisms, largely true — that in this age of ideological criticism the plain art  of writing well has become terribly debased. Ground down by the ugly and  careless, it is easy to forget the power that a perfectly tuned sentence can  have. Some of Steiner’s formulations stop you in your tracks. “Both Th e Death  of Ivan Ilych and Th e Kreutzer Sonata are masterpieces, but masterpieces  of a singular order,” he writes. “Th eir terrible intensity arises not out of  a prevalence of imaginative vision but out of its narrowing; they possess,  like the dwarf-like fi gures in the paintings of Bosch, the violent energies of  compression” (283). Or on the urban landscape: “Dostoevsky moved with  purposeful familiarity amid a labyrinth of tenements, garrets, railway yards,  and tentacular suburbs . . .  Tolstoy was most thoroughly at home in a city when  it was being burnt down” (198).13 Steiner has a special way with the lower  animals. “Gania’s house [in Th e Idiot] is one of those Dostoevskian towers of  Babel from whose dank rooms an army of characters pours forth like dazzled  bats” (159). And further: “D. H. Lawrence’s dislike of the Dostoevskyan  manner is notorious; he hated the strident, rat-like confi nement of it” (208). Closely related to this exquisite literacy is a trait that Steiner shares with  Vladimir Nabokov in his pedagogic mode: an unembarrassed willingness to  retell large amounts of plot and cite huge chunks of primary text. It is the  sort of thing we always warn our undergraduates against: “Assume,” we say,  “that the person grading your paper will already know the plot.” Now Steiner  assumes that his readers will know a great deal — the depth, spread, and  light touch of his allusions make that clear — but he nevertheless walks us,  13 One compromising side eff ect of Steiner’s relentless pursuit of elegance, however, is  a certain rhetorical imprecision: “railway yards” and “tentacular suburbs” are not really  characteristic of Dostoevsky’s cities, but rather of novels by Dickens or Zola set in Paris  and London — or by an American novelist such as Th eodore Dreiser. — 207 — </page> <page sequence="17"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ episode by episode, through twenty pages each on Anna Karenina, Th e Idiot,  and Th e Possessed, for what seems to be the sheer pleasure and love of it.  “Just look at how good this is,” he appears to be saying over and over — much  in the spirit of Nabokov’s lecture notes on Chekhov and Tolstoy, which often  do little more than note and annotate the primary author’s moves over  a wide stretch of text. When Nabokov really dislikes an author, as he does  Dostoevsky, we get scornful and rather abstract analysis.14 On one level this is doubtless a commonsense acknowledgment that  readers can love a novel but still benefi t from some rehearsal of the plot  before being asked to follow an analysis of its more subtle moves. More  importantly, however, plot summary seems to be Steiner’s way of leaving his  readers with a fuller taste of the primary text than of its secondary critical  effl  uvia. When the critic himself is a gifted writer, this is not an easy task.  Although Steiner, to be sure, is much more the mediator and literary tour  guide than Nabokov, both seem to nurse a nostalgia for that “city of primary  things” from which critics should be, and have been, banished. A fi nal observation might be made on Steiner’s evaluation of his own  contribution to learning with this book. At the end of chapter one, Steiner  apologizes to the professionals in Russian literature: “I shall be approaching  the Tolstoyan and Dostoevskyan texts by way of translation. Th is means  that the work can be of no real use to scholars of Russian and to historians  of Slavic languages and literature” (44). Th is is nonsense. If Steiner were  analyzing poetry, or doing textological work and close reading for dialect or  style, then of course; but the bulk of Dostoevsky’s and Tolstoy’s genius is  eminently translatable. What is more, this body of work has been subject to  at least as many constricting or superfi cial readings by native speakers and  readers of Russian as by gifted outsiders. To assume that humanistic thought  must always work with the grain of “original national languages” in order to  make an authentic contribution to scholarship is to underestimate the power  of ideas, the mission of prose, and the value of minds from various cultures  working on one another.  Only occasionally does one sense the relative thinness of Steiner’s feel  for the Russian context: his strange rendering of Notes from Underground  as Letters from the Underworld, for example, which suggests a classical  14 Compare, for example, Nabokov’s admiring discussions of Anna Karenina, “Th e Death of  Ivan Ilych,” and “Th e Lady with the Little Dog” — all annotated plot summaries — with  his vituperative putdown of Dostoevsky’s banal plots and “neurotic” heroes.

GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- inspiration (Lucian’s “Dialogues with the Dead”) attractive for this volume  but not relevant for Dostoevsky; and his habit of referring to adult women  of good standing by their fi rst names only (“Nastasya”) rather than name  and patronymic (“Nastasya Filippovna”). Th ese intonations give a European  sheen to these two titans that softens their Russianness. But overall, the  benefi ts that Steiner’s broadly cast net brings to Slavists far outweigh the  occasional local misprision. Steiner’s readings oblige Russian literature  professionals to confront yet again a question that never seems to go away:  How much in Russia’s great writers is irreducibly Russian (as the writers  themselves, caught in a massive identity crisis along with their nation,  would like to claim), and how much overlaps and duplicates the experience  of Western Europe? We recall Steiner’s thesis in chapter one: the European  novel knew itself, but the American and Russian novel was always — and  often unhappily — in search of itself. Two examples from Tolstoy. In the Russian fi eld we have what is called  a tolstoyeved: a specialist on Tolstoy or, in the Soviet academic context,  a scholar who has spent the better part of a life ingesting every text and  commentary in the ninety-volume Jubilee Edition. Th is person will have  a thick cloud of references to back up the genesis of every one of the  master’s ideas. All contradictions have already been classifi ed; Tolstoy has  long been a product, and at times even a prisoner, of his own extensive self- documentation. So has the tolstoyeved. Steiner brings a diff erent sort of  ballast to the task — and, as it were, loosens the Tolstoyan text for a moment  from the paper trail of its author’s life. Consider the First Epilogue to War and Peace. I was surprised that Steiner,  with his independent and astute eye, reads these fi nal domestic scenes in  the irredeemably negative way common to readers in the West — for whom,  Hollywood-like, any weight gain for the heroine is the beginning of the  end. “Brightness falls from the air” (108), Steiner says. Natasha has become  stout, stingy, untidy; Sonya is weary; the old Countess is senile. “Th e saddest  metamorphosis is that of Pierre. With marriage to Natasha, he has suff ered a sea- change into something neither rich nor strange” (109). “Tolstoy’s iconoclasm  is relentless,” Steiner writes; “each character in turn is seen corroded” (109). True, Steiner does see some small surviving light in the larger picture.  Th e Epilogue can be read in two ways, he suggests. “In its corrosive account  of the Rostov and Bezukhov marriages there is expressed Tolstoy’s nearly  pathological realism” (that is clearly the bad side); but there is also the good  side, a formal loophole implicit in the very openness of the ending, which  “proclaims the Tolstoyan conviction that a narrative form must endeavor to  — 209 — </page> <page sequence="19"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ rival the infi nity — literally, the unfi nishedness — of actual experience” (112).  Possible, yes, but unfocused and pale. Th en Steiner hints, albeit without  enthusiasm, at a potential third reading: that Tolstoy, although he records  “with the hard irony of a poet” all of Natasha’s “parsimony, untidiness,  and querulous jealousy,” nevertheless does enunciate through her person  “essential Tolstoyan doctrines.” Th us he probably intends us to applaud her  “ferocious standards of monogamy and . . . utter absorption in the details  of childbearing” (110). What is missing, however, from this grudging debt  to redemptive family-making is any non-trivial attempt to respect, or to  understand from within, the evolving world view of Tolstoy himself, a man  as experienced in married life and parenthood as he was in words. Why does this matter? Because anyone familiar with the long, subtle  genesis of Tolstoy’s views on families and on love will agree that the Epilogue  provides us not with a “pathological realism” but with scenes of genuine  prosaic bliss. In the late 1850s, in the fi nal volume (Youth) of his childhood  trilogy, Tolstoy outlined a three-part typology of love from which he  henceforth never deviated. Types one and two — respectively, the “beautiful- romantic” and the “self-sacrifi cing” modes of loving — are mercilessly  exposed as false and internally contradictory. Only type three, “active love,”  is genuinely worthy of the name, and its purpose is not to encourage in  one’s mate more of the “rich and strange” but rather to anticipate everyday  necessities; to clarify, bind, and infi ltrate the other life, to serve the quotidian  need. Both Natasha and Marya accomplish this task splendidly in their  married states. Unmarried, Natasha was irresistible, yes, but she was also  unstable, too full of self and uncertain where to invest it, a type one (so, for  diff erent reasons, was her brother). Sonya was, and remains at the end of  the novel, a sterile type two. Th e rhythms of family — which Tolstoy deeply  understands but never idealizes nor presumes to be without cost — can only  succeed with type-three lovers. Otherwise you will not have the energy to  survive and multiply. In reading the Epilogue as negative and “corrosive,”  Steiner, the model pan-European, gives himself away. Courtly Renaissance  moorings, the Distant Beloved, and conventional Tristan-and-Isolde refl exes  in matters of love are precisely what Tolstoy has set out to refute with his  scenes of everyday, and thus imperfect and real, human commitment. Now for our second example. In his discussion (129–31) of Tolstoy  as dramatist, Steiner devotes some time to his fi nal play, that “colossal  fragment” Th e Light Th at Shines in the Darkness. Steiner correctly reads the  play — essentially a chunk of Tolstoy’s own diaries cast in dramatic form —  as an exercise in autobiography. Comparing Tolstoy with Molière, who is  — 210 — </page> <page sequence="20"> ----------------------------------- 8. GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- alleged to have “satirized his own infi rmities in Le Malade imaginaire,”  Steiner asserts that “Tolstoy did something crueler: in his last, unfi nished  tragedy he held up to public ridicule and indictment his own most hallowed  beliefs” (129). As Steiner interprets the play, its hero — the patriarch  and pacifi st Saryntsev — comes out the loser in almost every dramatized  encounter with his family or ideological opponents. “With pitiless veracity  Tolstoy shows the man’s blindness, his egotism, and the ruthlessness which  can inspire a prophet who believes himself entrusted with revelation . . . ”  Nowhere was Tolstoy more naked,” Steiner concludes. “He presented the  anti-Tolstoyan case with uncanny persuasiveness” (129). Taken in the context of Tolstoy’s other writings during his fi nal decades,  this reading of the play is quite astonishing. For however much we might  wish to reassure ourselves, there is little indication that Tolstoy meant us  to see Saryntsev, the light that shone in the darkness, as blind or ruthless.  On the contrary, Saryntsev was making morally correct choices. Th e outer  world — the outer darkness — would inevitably judge these acts in terms  of the suff ering they brought others, and thus call them blind or cruel.  Th at cruelty, however, is the inescapable byproduct of ethically consistent  behavior and must be borne. Such is the epic’s dispassionate horizon, the  relentless moral “dyad,” not the compassion of novel or even of tragedy. Th e dilemma here thus resembles the one surrounding Prince Myshkin  in Th e Idiot: through his Christ-like goodness, the prince ruins every life he  touches. How does Dostoevsky resolve this disagreeable truth? Steiner is  very good on Myshkin in this regard: “Th e ‘idiot’ is love incarnate,” Steiner  writes, “but in him love itself is not made fl esh: . . . Myshkin’s ‘crime’ is the  excess of compassion over love” (171). Such humility, alas, is not Tolstoy’s.  Tolstoy was unable to fi nish his fi nal play, I suggest, not because he was  embarrassed or stricken by the “pitiless veracity” of its hero’s failure — but  because Tolstoy, as playwright, had not yet found a way to make his point  of view more irresistibly persuasive. Tolstoy was no advocate of the overly  clever “problem play.” Rather, he believed in the theater as a crucible for the  right sort of “infection,” one whose fi rst task was to move human feelings.  Mere outrageousness or run-of-the-mill unhappiness hardly mattered to  the rightness of a moral position (witness Tolstoy’s relish at the scandal  over Th e Kreutzer Sonata, and his insistence that he stood behind its ideal  of marital celibacy). Impartiality of the Shakespearean sort was corrupt.  Th e unfi nishedness of Th e Light Th at Shines in the Darkness can sooner be  attributed to Tolstoy’s frustration over the proper portrayal of his “positive  hero” — the parallels with Dostoevsky’s quest to portray a “perfect man”  — 211 — </page> <page sequence="21"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ are intriguing — than to any special discomfort on the part of Tolstoy, who  witnesses his own nakedness in a perfectly crafted self-parody. In both these readings, Steiner reads and reacts as a sophisticated,  culturally fl exible European. Together with Joseph Frank, he is probably our  most accomplished comparativist at work on Russian material. Inevitably,  some of his balanced good sense and breadth rub off  on his subject. For  Slavists who read Tolstoy and Dostoevsky within these novelists’ own more  savage, insecure worlds, this can be an often startling corrective. § In conclusion let me return to the comparison, mentioned in the opening  pages of this essay, between Steiner and Bakhtin. In Steiner’s poetics,  Tolstoy is at heart an epic writer and Dostoevsky a tragic dramatist. In  Bakhtin’s poetics, however, neither novelist by defi nition can be either  of those things — because for him the essence of the novel lies, fi rst, in  transcending the stasis and impenetrable “absolute distance” of epic, and  second, in surpassing the easy staged performability and “compositional  dialogue” (almost always monologic) immanent to drama. For Steiner, the  “epic” aspects of Tolstoy are revealed in a lack of sentimentality, in a passion  for the pitiless eff ect of circumstances and things on human beings, and in  a pagan insistence that all moral dilemmas must be resolved in this world —  without recourse to the miracles, mysteries, and authorities of God. Aspects  of Tolstoyan aesthetics that do not fi t the Homeric model (Tolstoy’s rejection  of heroism, for example) Steiner does not hide, but also he does not elaborate.  And well he might not, because to a very large extent Tolstoy’s militant anti- heroicism is what makes the Tolstoyan novel what it is. Th e case is more complex with the analogy between Dostoevsky and  tragic drama. At base the problem is Steiner’s rather uncomplicated notion  of dialogue, which he sees as a continuum from its novelistic to its stage- drama poles. “It should be noted,” Steiner remarks in his discussion of Th e  Idiot, “that our diffi  culties in perceiving all the levels of action at a fi rst  reading [of this scene in the novel] are strictly comparable to the diffi  culties  we experience when fi rst hearing a complex piece of dramatic dialogue in  the theater” (161). But they are not “strictly comparable” at all, if readers  of the novel attend to the intricate layers and voice zones that permeate  even the simplest narrative fi ller between slices of direct speech. Bakhtin’s  major concern — how words work in novels — is not Steiner’s. Th at Steiner  — 212 — </page> <page sequence="22"> ----------------------------------- 8. GEORGE STEINER ON TOLSTOY OR DOSTOEVSKY   ---------------------------------- does not engage his texts at this level has little to do with the language  barrier and much to do with the indwelling “unspeakability” of novelistic  worlds (especially Dostoevsky’s worlds), their potential to sound several  voices at once, and thus their resistance to even the most subtle intonation  on stage — which would embody one side of them too aggressively and thus  fl atten them out. At several points, Steiner aligns Dostoevsky with the Aristotelian  notions of dramatic catharsis (213) and a fusion of “‘thought’ with ‘plot’”  (228). Signifi cantly, Bakhtin resists both these moves. “Tragic catharsis (in  the Aristotelian sense) is not applicable to Dostoevsky,” Bakhtin writes.  “Th e catharsis that fi nalizes Dostoevsky’s novels might be — of course  inadequately and somewhat rationalistically — expressed this way: nothing  conclusive has yet taken place in the world, the ultimate word of the world and  about the world has not yet been spoken, the world is open and free, everything is  still in the future and will always be in the future.”15 Steiner admits the radical  freedom of Dostoevsky’s characters, their freedom both from “their creator’s  will and our own previsions.” He senses the polyphony that Bakhtin makes  explicit. But then he attaches it to the dramatic, not to the novelistic. To conclude, then. In this refi tting of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky back into  epic and tragedy, that is, into the two genres most central to a classical  poetics, we feel most palpably and literally the “oldness” of Steiner’s Old  Criticism. Th is sense of the richness of the old, its ever-present relevance, is  surely one of the most liberating aspects of Steiner’s book. For in contrast  to so much in modern critical practice that reduces the past to a pale, always  inadequate refl ection of the values and politics of the present moment,  Steiner starts with the assumption that all great literature is richer than any  single subsequent time could possibly appreciate in full. Again Bakhtin might be an appropriate guide to Steiner’s larger intent.  In 1970, near the end of his life, Bakhtin was invited by the editorial board of  Russia’s leading literary journal to comment on the future of Soviet literary  studies. In his open letter Bakhtin wrote: “Authors and their contemporaries  see, recognize and evaluate primarily that which is close to their own day.  Th e author is a captive of his epoch, of his own present. Subsequent times  liberate him from this captivity, and literary scholarship is called upon to  assist in this liberation.”16 Now “liberation” is a fi ghting word. But in his  15 Bakhtin, Problems of Dostoevsky’s Poetics, 165–66. Emphasis in original. 16 M. M. Bakhtin, “Reply to a Question from the Novy Mir Editorial Staff ,” in Speech Genres  and Other Late Essays, trans. Vern W. McGee (Austin: University of Texas Press, 1986), 5. — 213 — </page> <page sequence="23"> ------------------------------------------------   PART II. ON THE MASTER WORKERS   ------------------------------------------------ letter Bakhtin intends the word in a sense quite contrary to the radical  intent so commonly invested in it by activist critics. For Bakhtin, “liberation”  meant a suspicion of the impulse to measure all of past culture by the social  or political standards of the present day. Precisely that narrowing of vision  makes an author — and a reader — a “captive of his or her own epoch.”  Releasing us from that captivity is the most important service that other  times, past and future, can tender us; this is what great novels are for. Th us  to “liberate authors from their epochs” is not to read them into contexts  that are immediately relevant to us. In Bakhtin’s world view, more likely the  opposite obtains: to liberate authors is to make them as open as possible to  as many times as possible. Th is conviction lies at the base of Steiner’s critical world view as well.  In Real Presences he takes severely to task the hardcore pretensions of  literary theory — starting with the “absolutely decisive failing” that occurs  when theoretical approaches attempt more than linguistic description and  classifi cation, “when such approaches seek to formalize meaning.”17 In Tolstoy  and Dostoevsky, the ancient past is revealed as a rich and surprising source  for present insight. Or as Bakhtin put this point, musing on the paradox  that going forward begins by looking back: “Dostoevsky has not yet become  Dostoevsky, he is still becoming him.”18 More than anything, such faith  qualifi es George Steiner as a resident in his own republic of primary things. 17 George Steiner, Real Presences (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989), 81. Steiner  defi nes literature (and art and music as well) as “the maximalization of semantic  incommensurability in respect of the formal means of expression” (83). 18 Mikhail Bakhtin, “Toward a Reworking of the Dostoevsky Book [1961],” in Problems of  Dostoevsky’s Poetics, 291. — 214 — </page> </plain_text>
