<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES HARTSHORISE THE DIPOLAR CONCEPTION OF DEITY CHARLES HARTSHORNE ?TJ.R. Merold Westphal's "Temporality and Finitism in Harts horne's Theism" seems to me one of the most carefully reasoned and fair, though radically critical, essays with which I have yet been favored.1 Although he seems partial to Thomism, he grants some of my chief points in criticism of that doctrine as it is com monly understood, particularly that there must be contingent properties in God. This has not traditionally been understood as a Thomistic doctrine, and as Westphal seems to admit, it is not sug gested by actus purus. (If I were to accomplish nothing else than to bring about the definitive abandonment of the traditional notion of God's pure necessity, not simply for existence and essence but for all properties whatever, I would not have labored in vain.) Where my critic wishes to disagree with me is that whereas (1) he thinks that a contingent property can be eternal, I hold with Aristotle that what is eternal is necessary and vice versa; and (2) whereas he sees no need for God's contingent properties to be dependent upon the creatures, I hold that they must have such dependence, and even causal or "ontological" dependence (to use my critic's words). Disagreement (1) concerns God's immut ability, and (2) His total independence or absoluteness. I regard the unqualified denial of divine change (in the form of increase of content) and the unqualified denial of relativity or dependence as catastrophic errors, and of course I am far from alone in this. How are these issues to be argued? First of all, the reasoning on my side can hardly be put into an article, and is far from being exhausted by Westphal's summary. I do not mean that he took no pains to make it exhaustive. I sense that he did. But I think that he failed, and that this was probably inevitable. For all sorts of metaphysical and religious issues are 1 This Review, XIX, 3 (1966), pp. 550-564.</page><page sequence="2">274 CHARLES HARTSHORNE at stake. I shall first mention one point which alone would suffice for me personally. For reasons that I have given in various writ ings, I take "true religion" to mean serving God, by which I do not mean simply admiring or "obeying" him, or enabling him to give benefits to me and other nondivine creatures, but also, and most essentially, contributing value to God which he would otherwise lack. Even in this religious case, to "serve" is to confer a benefit, in precisely the sense that the served will to some extent depend upon the server for that benefit. This is genuine dependence. Of course, I am not talking about God's existence depending upon us: that is the point of my distinction between the abstract absoluteness and the concrete relativity of God. God's absolute essence will exist, i.e., be realized somehow, in some suitable concrete "state" (I shall try to justify this term presently), regardless of what we do. But the value of the state will derive from us something it would otherwise lack. In short, God with contingency but lacking dependence is not the God we can serve or, in what I think is the proper meaning, worship. Nor do I think such a God could be anything but an empty abstraction, far from the God of the Bible (as Pascal hinted and many scholars, for i ^ ?tance Wolf son, have explicitly said.) Another argument not mentioned in the article is that if God eternally possesses whatever he does possess, then eternally he must content himself with that possession, rather than wishing to add to it. But now comes the dilemma: in this possession is either all possible value, or not all possible value. The first alternative I hold has no clear and consistent meaning; for possibilities are in part mutually incompatible (God can have me actually doing what I do do, but he cannot also, either eternally or otherwise, have me doing the things I might have done but do not do). The second alternative prompts the query, why stop forever at a value which is capable of addition? So I hold that being wholly immutable is not the most exalted status, but either an absurdity or else the status of something essentially abstract. Of course you can say that God's possession of this world is no actual divine value at all, since he is "all possible perfection with or without the world"? whatever that means. In short, we contribute nothing. However, like John Dewey and William James I question whether it makes sense for a creature to say of itself that in final (divine) perspective</page><page sequence="3">THE DIPOLAR CONCEPTION OF DEITY 275 it has no value, its choices make no difference, all possible good being actual anyway. Here we are, making decisions; they are our decisions, not God's; and from the allegedly divine or ultimate perspective they accomplish nothing. So much the worse for that alleged perspective, since we cannot live in its light?or darkness. Now let us come closer to my critic's argumentation. He rejects the temporal theory of modality and thinks Aristotle held this only because his God could not furnish an adequate basis for a modal theory. The temporal conception is said to be an extensional view of modality; that is, though the contingent things are all held to be temporal and the necessary things eternal, this does not give the very meaning or intension of the modal terms. I agree it does not, as Aristotle handles the matter, taking his view to be the exten sional one. But my view is that the temporal theory has to be taken intensionally to make sense. For how do we recognize some thing as eternal or necessary? Is it by observing its eternity? Aristotle apparently thought we could observe the immunity of the heavenly bodies to decay; but this was a logical or methodological blunder. An absolute and everlasting absence of decay is in prin ciple unobservable since, for one thing, to detect it would require infinite accuracy. The epistemic meaning for eternal is "neces sary." I hold that this obtains even for divine knowledge (even though God can be infinitely accurate), but I might grossly beg the question if I assumed that as premiss at this stage of the argu ment. Still, there is perhaps an at least equal burden of proof on the other side. If the epistemic meaning for "eternal" is "necessary," then eternity should be defined as necessary existence. The eternal always exists because it cannot not exist, as was said long ago, for instance by Spinoza (who spoiled it by making necessity apply to everything) and by Johannes Krell, a Socinian theologian, who did not spoil it. But Westphal thinks that there can be contingent things which are also eternal. Spinoza's reasoning at this point seems to me strong: God eternally decides this; he might eternally have decided that; thus we have two alternative forms, even if not "states" in the temporal sense, of God, each of which was possible but only one actual. However, is it not in time alone that we can intelligibly seek such alternativeness? Before an agent actually does such and such, there is the antecedent, at least slightly neutral</page><page sequence="4">276 CHARLES HARTSHORNE or "indeterminate situation" (to use a favorite phrase of Dewey's) in which it is not yet decided which way the agent will take. Many authors have shown that the principle of universal causality can be construed as compatible with this, nay as implying it.) So, if we accept Westphal's view, it is as though we were trying to conceive a pre-eternal form of deity in which the options were still open, compared to the actual eternal form in which they are closed. I shall here be accused of anthropomorphism, or of confusing the unimaginable with the inconceivable. Still, it is notorious, or should have been, at least since Hume if not since Carneades, that an essential question about theism is how this distinction is to be made in the philosophy of religion. Made it must be, but exactly how is a hard, hard question, not an easy one. Every atheist or positivist accuses theism as such of anthropomorphism, or of fail ing to escape the dilemma: either anthropomorphism or words from which all meaning has departed (Hume). The troubles with set theory alone should showr how difficult it is to know what is conceivable, though not imaginable. I hold that an eternal con tingency is strictly inconceivable, as it certainly is strictly unknow able humanly speaking, and I think the burden of proof is on him who claims to conceive it. Temporal contingency, alterna ti venes s, we know, if we know any cases of contingency or freedom at all, but eternal ones . . .? A somewhat similar objection holds of course against Kant's solution of the problem of human freedom. My critic shrewdly notes that although I assert that God's knowledge, like ours, depends upon its objects and not vice versa, I nevertheless admit a symmetry of logical interdependence between God's knowing that we, for example, exist, and our actually exist ing. God cannot know this unless we exist, but (because of his infallibility) he cannot fail to know it if we do exist. From this alone, I grant, it does not follow formally that there is an asym metrical relation of causal or ontological dependence of divine knowing on the thing known. Nor of course does it follow that, as Westphal holds, there is an asymmetrical ontological relation running the other way. What does follow is that there is an ontological dependence both ways between divine knowing of something and the something. Yet, as we shall see, there is also a one-way ontological dependence of the former on the latter. Ontological dependence is implied by logical dependence. For, so</page><page sequence="5">THE DIPOLAR CONCEPTION OF DEITY 277 far as there is a distinction, it is logical dependence which asserts more! By ontological dependence I mean this: x depends on y if and only if, without y, x cannot be; and x is independent of y if and only if it could be, although y were not. Logical inter dependence, if it means anything, symmetrically excludes this latter possibility a priori. Thus the total ontological independence of God from the world and of the world from God are alike excluded by the admission of the logical relations Westphal con cedes. Or, as I like to put it, God and the creatures must "inter act." (The abstract divine existence of course is independent, but not the divine knowledge in its concreteness.) But now I seem to be in a difficulty. For I hold that, in all cases, things known are independent of the actual knowing, yet I have just said that we could not exist without God's knowing that we do. I may not have published in a conspicuous place the solution to this puzzle, but there is one. Our existing is indeed not independent of the mere fact that God knows this existence; since he could not fail to know it if it is there to be known. But the fact that God knows us is far from a complete description of God's actual concrete knowing of us. There is the question of how he knows us, in what perspective he puts this knowledge, with what valuational nuances, etc. And although, by the general principle of knowledge, taken realistically, the thing known must be independent of any actual concrete knowing in which it functions as object, it need not be independent of the mere abstract fact that it is known in some suitable concrete knowing. By analogy, if in our vicinity there occurs an explosion which is not enough to deprive us of consciousness, it may be inevitable or at least almost infinitely probable, that we shall quickly become aware of it. But still, the exact how of this awareness may be left quite open by the explosive antecedent situation. With God the probability of the explosion's being known becomes certainty. He cannot not know what has occurred. But this inevitable knowing is abstract; con crete divine awareness is something else. It is not inevitable, and its relations are different. Here there is only one-way dependence, that of the knowing upon what is known. Not that we, for instance, are in the end independent of God's concrete knowledge, but that in our successive states we depend on God's actual or concrete knowing only so far as this is antecedent to the states.</page><page sequence="6">278 CHARLES HARTSHORNE God as already knowing what I have been influences me in what I am now about to do and be ; but God as knowing this present deed or state will never influence me as in that state, but only as in sub sequent states. This is not a simple view, but it is the one by which a process viewr of God will have to be judged. I grant that Aquinas, in denying that relations between God and things were real for God, did not mean that they were imagi nary. But he meant and said that their reality was in and for the world, not for God. The world is really, not imaginarily, related to God; but it is, for Aquinas, a mistake to try to give these rela tions a locus in God. It is a category mistake, not a mere fancy. However, as my critic seems to grant, and Aquinas granted, in all ordinary cases relations between knowing and thing known are real only in the knowing, while so far as the thing known is con cerned they are ens rationis, relations only in idea, or in the mind. Yet Westphal wants to invert this with respect to God, as the possibility I have overlooked (as though I had not been vividly aware of it?as a traditional tour de force), holding that in the case of God's knowing, it is the thing known which is really related, while for the knowing the relation is in idea only. If "in idea" means in God's idea, my point has been granted, the relation is really in God. If it means, in our idea, then we are back at my interpretation of Aquinas's sufficiently clear text, namely that the world is really related to God, not God to the world. To contain relation-to-# is to contain x, and if the world is really relative to God, then the world is God as well as something else. I have elab orately defended the thesis that the relative includes and is incom parably more than the "absolute," if this word means the strictly independent or nonrelative. And if it means supremely great, good, and wronderful, then it cannot also mean strictly independ ent. Equivocation between these two meanings, the one negative, the other positive, has been the standard device of absolutisms all over the planet, e.g., in India and in Greece. The philosophical absolute is not the Biblical God. Of this I am as convinced as before I read Westphal's essay. I admire his ingenuity, I sense his honesty, and yet, wrongly or rightly, I do not find that he has a case. And I wonder why, apart from histor ical accidents, he wants to make the case, since God can be perfect</page><page sequence="7">THE DIPOLAR CONCEPTION OF DEITY 279 in every religiously relevant sense without being wholly immutable, or in his concrete actuality independent. I cannot but feel it to be a fair question: do we worship God, or do we worship certain philosophical abstractions inherited from the Greeks, e.g., immutability, independence or absoluteness, infinity, simplicity, and the rest? The point is not?far from it? that these abstractions have no application to God. But to grant this applicability is one thing, and to suppose that divinity just is absoluteness, infinity, immutability, so that the contrary terms, relative, finite, mutable, in no way apply?that is quite another. For me, God is indeed absolute, but not "the absolute," he is infinite but not "the infinite," necessary and yet not simply ens necessarium. The remarkable thing is that Westphal seems willing to go along with process philosophers in admitting contingency as well as necessity in the divine reality. Why then boggle at relativity, finitude, potentiality, change (as increase only) ? If Aquinas has a clear doctrine, it is, I should have thought, that necessity, infin ity, immutability, eternity, simplicity, independence, belong to gether. If instead he admitted a "dipolar" view with respect to necessity, but not with respect to the other terms, then I think Philo and Maimonides were superior. For these men tried to keep throughout to the monopolar way of contrasting God with other beings. Once that is given up at the crucial point of necessity and contingency, it seems arbitrary to continue the onesided doctrine everywhere else. I am not convinced that it is fair to accuse Aquinas of this arbitrariness. There is a pathos in Westphal's admission that the Saint was handicapped in trying to express what Westphal thinks has to be said. He not only had no language to say it clearly, he had none to think it clearly. His clarity was rather in denying it. But then inevitably the attempt to conceive God as more than a bare abstraction breaks down. Concerning Plato's idea of the self-movement of the soul : that Aquinas thought he was in agreement with this is one thing; that he really was in agreement with it is another. (Perhaps it is relevant here that Aristotle seldom if ever attacks his master more sharply than at this point.) A further question is whether Plato was free from confusion in the matter. I take him to have been somewhat confused, and Aristotle and Aquinas to have resolved</page><page sequence="8">280 CHARLES HARTSHORNE the ambiguity in just the wrong way. Their rejection of the world soul is in agreement with this interpretation, from my point of view. What is at stake is the principle of self-creativity, whose materials are prior acts of self-creation by the same or other indi viduals, that rarest of philosophical concepts in anything like explicit form?though Ikhnaton, the "first monotheist," seems almost to have had it. // (per impossibile) all genuine values were mutually com patible, sheer possession of all would seem to be the highest con ceivable form of actuality, and we should have to attribute this to God. And then indeed all genuine movement toward something not yet possessed would be inferior?indeed superfluous. But, since there are mutually incompatible yet positive values (and I hold that this is essential to the distinction between possible and actual), the highest form of individual life or consciousness must be, not an unsurpassable possession of value, but a combination of actual possession with capacity for further possession, which com bination is surpassable only by the being itself. Fechner came very close to this idea, and it is sad that this valuable contribution has been entirely missed by historians and writers of reference works, who have also overlooked similar ideas of Socinus and Krell, Lequier, W. P. Montague, etc. We have in such men a new basic form of religious metaphysics, a form even now scarcely noticed in standard histories, encyclopedias, or textbooks. Mill, whom my critic mentions, had scarcely a glimpse of the neoclassical view; James was as onesidedly finitistic as classical theism was onesidedly infinitistic; even Brightman was not one of the best representatives of the dipolar view, though he does deserve mention, and I welcome the introduction of his name. Heidegger in a notable footnote hints at a divine "infinite tem porality." Peirce hinted at it also, but then wavered and seemed to fall back confusedly into monopolarity, with talk about ens necessarium. Bergson implied but did not explicitly develop the view, similarly Varisco and my teacher Hocking. Whitehead and I, somewhat independently as it happens (I am thinking of my 1923 Harvard thesis, written when I had never seen Whitehead, had read him but slightly and nothing was available of his thought about God), have definitely expounded the dipolar view, White</page><page sequence="9">THE DIPOLAR CONCEPTION OF DEITY 281 head extremely brilliantly, but also briefly and somewhat cryp tically, and I at great length and with as much clarity as immense effort has made possible. So far as I know, I?and a few of my ex students or attentive readers?are alone in having much idea of the history of this kind of religious metaphysics. Whitehead appar ently did not know those who most closely anticipated him (except James Ward), and his critics seem not to know them either. Brightman's "finite-infinite God" is far from being the same as a "finite God," and to assume their equivalence is just to argue from the monopolar prejudice which is the main point at issue. Nor did Brightman assert the temporality of God solely because of the problem of evil. He had glimpses of deeper reasons. So did the others mentioned?except perhaps Mill, who was a determinist (for all his defense of political freedom). What could he know of the basic grounds for a process philosophy or a metaphysics of self creation ? Mr. Westphal asks: Would democracy be preferable to the rule of an infinitely wise benevolent tyrant? My answer is an emphatic Yes, if the tyrant is to determine everything! For then the "citizens" would not really determine anything, and it would be a mystery how they could even know what "determine" or "decide" means. The value of democracy?surely this is common place?is not merely that the right decisions are more likely to be made, but that the process of deciding, which in principle is life itself, is distributed instead of monopolized. Unqualified monopoly is always bad, even in the eminent case. Or rather, there can be no eminent monopoly of power. There can indeed be Eminent Power, but eminence is quite other than monopoly. Inferior, weak beings may long to determine everything; the Eternally Secure has no fear of letting others do some of the deciding. Eminent generosity in delegating decision-making to others, and taking loving possession of the results, that is the real Eminence. Widely different from the objections considered above, yet exhibiting the same?or a greater?failure to reckon with the principles of dipolarity and universal creativity apart from which my philosophy is unintelligible, are the criticisms now to be con sidered.2 2 This Review, XX, 2 (1966), pp. 278-289.</page><page sequence="10">282 CHARLES HARTSHORNE Professors Madden and Hare launch what may perhaps be call ed an all-out-attack upon the idea of God which they attribute to me as well as to Whitehead (they seem to see only terminological distinctions between us, although most students of our writings would perhaps question this identification). They proffer three main objections: (1) "The distinction between a 'limited' and a 'relative' God" is not shown to be meaningful; (2) no "guarantee" is given of "the triumph of good in this world"; and (3) the con cepts of good and evil are characterized "in a way that is not only incompatible with theism but odd on any view." (1) Since no such distinction as that between a limited and a relative God has ever been proposed by me or by Whitehead, we are not obligated to show that the distinction is meaningful. The term 'relative' was used by me not at all in order to avoid admit ting limitation?or finitude?in God. Quite the contrary?I hold, with Whitehead, but also with Hocking, Brightman, Montague, Pfleiderer, and still others, some of whom helped me to reach this doctrine before I knew anything of Whitehead's view on the sub ject, that God is (and without any contradiction or irreducible dialectical difficulty) both finite and infinite, limited and unlimited, relative and absolute. There has been no intention of avoiding a "straightforward" admission of finitude in God, provided it be accompanied by an equally literal affirmation of infinity in him. Of course we avoid "a finite God," since this seems to deny the infinity; and we refuse to identify God with "the infinite," since this contradicts the finitude. The critics neatly miss the point in saying: "The use of the word 'relative' rather than 'limited' is crucial. Whitehead and Hartshorne still conceive of their God as, in some sense, unlimited." Precisely, unlimited in some sense, or rather, in some aspect, and (as this suggests) in some other aspect limited, finite, or relative. 'Relative' is not used "rather than" 'limited' or 'finite' unless as a mere matter of frequency (not even that in Whitehead's case). The point is quite different: as against the "monopolar view" that God is wholly infinite, in no sense finite; wholly absolute, in no sense relative; pure being, in no sense becoming; wholly active, actual and simple, in no sense passive, potential, or complex, the "dipolar view" of "neoclassical theism" (my term) holds instead that the divine reality includes</page><page sequence="11">THE DIPOLAR CONCEPTION OF DEITY 283 the Eminent (or not, unless by self, surpassable) form of both poles in such contrasts. To miss this is not even to begin under standing the doctrine. The word 'finite' in relation to God has been used both by me and by Whitehead. Thus when the latter says that "All actual ization is finite," he is by no means excluding God as actual. The very passage which the critics mistakenly quote to make Whitehead seem responsible for a fancy of their own [see below under (2)] should in its context be almost enough to make this clear. But there are many other such passages, whether in Whitehead or in my writings. For example, Whitehead says that theologians have done a disservice to religion by identifying God with the infinite, and I have termed this procedure a species of idolatry. It is the same idolatry if, instead of infinity, absoluteness is used as synony mous with deity. 'Unlimited' or 'unconditioned' (pace Tillich) are of course no better. However, the critics are thinking particularly of God's power as limited or unlimited. Here there are several distinctions to be made. If power means potentiality for actualization, capacity for having various qualities should suitable causes be provided, then God, and he alone, according to neoclassicism, is capable of pos sessing any quality whatever. There are qualities no human being could possess, no matter what causes were provided; but God could and would prehend any actual quality or value, should it be actualized at all. Given any actuality, God's consequent nature will embrace that actuality in fully adequate conscious prehension. In this sense God has simply unlimited capacity for actualization. But if power means capacity to guarantee a particular fully specified form of actualization, either for oneself or for another, then accord ing to this philosophy there can be no such power. It is nonsense or contradiction. For in all actualization " self-created creatures" must be involved, and it is contradictory that the outcome should be uniquely determined by any one agent. What God cannot do in this respect, no conceivable being could either. Hence by my test of deity ("unsurpassable by any conceivable other individual"), there is in such "limitation" no infringement of religious require ments. And even 'limited in power' is misleading if, or insofar as, it suggests that an unlimited power is conceivable. God has as much power as anyone could have; he is able to do for creatures</page><page sequence="12">284 CHARLES HARTSHORNE whatever could be done for them by any conceivable eternal and universal being. But in this philosophy every actuality must be in some degree self-determined. Lequier said long ago that God creates us creators of ourselves. Whitehead (independently) adopts and generalizes this idea, which I had earlier arrived at in a less clear form, and the result is his "category of the ultimate" or "creativity." No conceivable God, according to this category, could do for us what can only be done by us. (Similar views are found in Bergson, Montague, and Berdyaev.) By the same prin ciple, no conceivable God could do for us what only fellow creatures can do, determine just what nondivine yet partly creative com panions we are to have, from electrons to human beings. What then can God do for the world? He can take each suc cessive phase of the cosmic development and make unsurpassably good use of that phase (a) in his own life, and (b) in furnishing the creatures with such guidance or inspiration (their "initial sub jective aims") as (my formula) will optimize the ratio of opportu nities and risks for the next phase. Thanks to (a), our momentary actuality achieves a literal though not conventionally conceived immortality (see below). As to (b), the contention is that no conceivable God could do more (apart from conventional personal immortality, which is about as credible or incredible in this as in most metaphysics). It is complained that neoclassicism demotes God from the status of Creator. It puts him into a relation of interaction with the world whereby what he accomplishes at a given stage is partly dependent upon the previous stages. Yes, indeed, and the French existentialist was right when he said (I quote from memory) : "God if he exists must be in a situation with respect to us." Granted real creativity in the creatures (and without it they could not know what "creator" meant) and apart from an extremely dubious and paradoxical notion of a first state of creation, it cannot be otherwise than that God should be in a situation of interaction with the nondivine individuals. It does not follow that there is no good meaning to the description of God as "Creator." A divine attribute is the eminent (unsurpassable) form of a general category (e.g., omniscience, of knowledge), and our neoclassical idea of God is precisely that his creativity is the unsurpassable form of self creation and creative influence over other individuals. This is,</page><page sequence="13">THE DIPOLAR CONCEPTION OF DEITY 285 one might soberly claim, the first philosophy which gives "Cre ator" a clear meaning by analogy with aspects of human experience. (2) Neither Whitehead nor I has ever suggested that God's existence "guarantees the triumph of good over evil." For us this phrase has no very definite meaning, unless an absurd one. The concept of creativity, whereby "the many becomes one and are increased by one," excludes any final maximum. Moreover, the idea of such a maximum is formally denied by Whitehead. In my case, the idea has never presented a living option. If Whitehead had asserted it, I am confident I should have broken with him at that point, as I have at certain others. But he did not assert it. The passage cited (p. 280) does not intend that. I know of no other student of Whitehead who ever thought it did. There is not, says Whitehead elsewhere, any "one far-off divine event toward which the whole creation moves." The infinity of pos sibilities in God's nature is inexhaustible in actuality even by divine power, or any conceivable power. For each creative synthesis furnishes materials for a novel and richer synthesis. Again, to miss this is to fail to reach first base in interpreting his philosophy. But not only is no final maximal achievement to be antici pated, but every new phase of the world involves new. possibilities of evil inherent in the new cases of creative freedom, each incapable of complete control by any antecedent conditions or any conceivable power other than the actuality in question. A multiplicity of actualities, each partly self-determined, involves an irreducible risk of conflict. The ground of evil and good is really the same, namely multiple freedom. Hence the ideal cannot be to eliminate risk of evil once for all, since this would eliminate novel opportunities for good as well, and would call an arbitrary halt to further realization of the inexhaustible possibilities of good. So I think this charge too is relevant only if one can show the conceivability of an exhaustive or a best actualization of possible good. (Spinoza and Leibniz tried, each in his own fashion, to tread this path.) Good is not an army and evil another, with the desirable outcome the uncondi tional surrender or absolute disappearance of the second army. This is the critic's fantasy or concern, not Whitehead's or mine. Life is more than a battle, especially a battle between abstractions. It is an art of creation, with God the eminent but not the sole creator.</page><page sequence="14">286 CHARLES HARTSHORNE (3) We come to the "odd" concepts of value. It is said that God wants both evil and good possibilities to be realized, and hence he is not good. But no one intends to say that God desires this or that particular evil to be realized. He desires that there be opportunities for good, and that these, as much as in each case is possible, should be realized. But opportunities are attended by risks, because of freedom (not because God is weak, by comparison with some conceivable being). So it is inevitable that any actual achievement will have some mixture of evil. But neither White head nor I has asserted that God desires the evil itself. Given free dom, some evils will certainly ensue, but one aims only at the good aspect, so far as one is ethical, and entirely so in the divine case. If Whitehead is not wholly clear on this, I say if, then I at least intend to be. And both of us hold that any actuality is on the whole good (the classical doctrine?being as such is good, evil only an aspect, never the whole). The critics seem to assume a very different, more Schopenhauerian view. As to the relation of aesthetic to ethical good, we hold that being ethical is to will the aesthetic good for all concerned, goodness of will being itself both an element of harmony, as Plato saw, and productive of further harmonies. Aesthetic value is measured by intensity and harmony of the elements of partly free experience. I am not con vinced that this is an odd view, and others besides Whitehead and myself have held it, including Berdyaev. Various critical comments, not so much about Whitehead's doctrine as about his language before he had fully worked out his view (he never did in all respects, as he told me), can be passed over. My thought about God is mine, and I recognize no obliga tion to conform to every sentence in Whitehead. I had thought a lot about God, and learned from many teachers and writers, before there was any way of knowing how Whitehead viewed the subject. If I have defended Whitehead's philosophy of religion it is partly because he is one of a dozen or so writers, and the greatest of them all, who broke, as I had already done, with classical theism or the monopolar view of deity, without falling into the opposite monopolarity of a merely finite God, an idea I toyed with but rejected long before. Three further objections must be dealt with. It is said that God cannot have infinite capacity to experience the immediacy of</page><page sequence="15">THE DIPOLAR CONCEPTION OF DEITY 287 past (i.e., "objectively immortal") actual entities, since this is con trary to the principle that no actual entity can experience the immediacy of past actual entities. This is a debated point in the interpretation of Whitehead. Whatever Whitehead intended, my view has always been that in God there are no "negative (or inadequate) prehensions," and that such prehensions are all that prevent ordinary prehending from capturing the complete imme diacy of past entities. I deplore Whitehead's misleading metaphor of "perishing" (after all, quoted from Locke) and never use it myself. Events occur, they "do not change," even by changing from vivid immediacies to mere abstract or pale objectivities. The apparent nonimmediacy of the given actualities is exactly what distinguishes ordinary from eminent or divine prehensions. (Un less this is a radical difference, there is no point in talking about God at all.) The essential structure of prehension, applicable even to God, includes the creative freedom of the prehensive synthesis and the one-way dependence of prehending upon prehended entities?an asymmetry which Whitehead and I both interpret to require a temporal distinction, the prehended always being past. But past entities are not wholly dead for anyone, and not at all dead for God; rather they "live forevermore." Unlike Whitehead, I hold that the foregoing view requires us to define God as an endur ing society of actualities, not a single actuality. Here I think Whitehead was just mistaken. It is said that I, like Whitehead, seek to make a mere principle also a personal, voluntary, or theistic God. I think Whitehead in the end does not do this; but no matter, certainly I do not. I have explained, in hundreds of pages, in what sense the abstract or eternal aspect of God is only an element in the divine actuality. God is not the absolute, and there is an absolute principle in him only as an abstractable aspect. The traditional absolute of classical theism was said to be God, and it is a main charge against that view that this does make God a mere abstract principle or idea, since only the non-particular and nonconcrete can be absolute. But concrete and individual are carefully distinguished by me, at least in many recent writings. God as purely absolute is a mere abstraction but only the individual, God, can have this abstraction as his own characteristic.</page><page sequence="16">288 CHARLES HARTSHORNE It is urged that the everlasting harmony in God cannot be felt by us. But the doctrine is that God's actual experiences are felt by all subsequent actual entities, even though in deficient manner (with much negative or inadequate prehension.) They are felt, however, as intrinsically everlasting, for everlastingness is not a contingent status, so that one must wait forever to see if the thing is always there. (In that case even God would never know that anything was everlasting.) Everlastingness is rather a necessity inherent in each entity that it be ever after in God. And obviously we can at least believe that God will everlastingly prehend us in unsurpassable fashion. To deny that this can or should be important to us is to make into a riddle the fact that we often go to great lengths to try to insure that human beings will, in a far from unsurpassable or everlasting fashion, remember our lives and actions. How difficult philosophical argument is ! I really don't know what the article I have been considering proves, unless that Whitehead and I are not infallible, or have not always chosen the best expressions for our views, or have not entirely finished our thinking about God. Or it proves or illustrates how hard it is to find common ground in philosophy. Or perhaps that my more recent writings are needed to make clear what I have been driving at. Or perhaps it chiefly illustrates the fact that some people are very eager to discredit theism. (These authors speak of "one more nail in the coffin of religious cosmology.") Good luck to all such people in general, not in this specific aim! A friend recently remarked, "I am very willing to be fair to my philosophical opponents because, without them, I should have nothing whatever to do." In something like that spirit I thank all critics of my writings or ideas. The neoclassical, dipolar, or panentheistic conception of deity is in essence centuries old. (Indeed in its intuitive content I take it to be thousands of years old.) What is new?indeed scarcely in being at all?is the careful responsible criticism of the conception by adequately trained and gifted philosophers who have achieved an understanding of what the conception at its best is and is not. The fate of the doctrine can not, in the long run, be made to depend upon the accidents of Whitehead's literary career, nor of mine either. It must depend upon what the conception by its intrinsic</page><page sequence="17">THE DIPOLAR CONCEPTION OF DEITY 289 logic is capable of accomplishing. I am almost as optimistic about that as the critics are pessimistic. At any rate that is the major issue between us. The University of Texas.</page></plain_text>
