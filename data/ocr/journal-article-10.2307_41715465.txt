<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of Haitian Studies , Volume 16 No. 1 © 2010 Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? Jean-Claude Fignolé Les Abricots, Haiti Translation by Kaiama L. Glover Barnard College , Columbia University Critics and exegetes of European literature of the Middle Ages have dubbed it "Marvelous," applying the term to the management and interpretation of the "literary object," as Shoshana Felman would have said. Alejo Carpentier speaks of the "Marvelous Real," attributing to the forms of expression uttered by peoples of Latin America a dimension of concreteness that goes beyond common sense even though it is defined by the unmediated observations of the senses, expressed moreover through that which is most sensitive and most significant in and of itself - literature. Jacques Stephen Alexis converted this into "Marvelous Realism," theorizing the problematic presence of a fiction, the collective imaginary, at the heart of a primordial fiction, the tale, indebted to a "specifically Haitian form of expression that maintains its specificity with respect to the trends and fluctuations of universal literature." From one period to the next, from one continent to the next, the question is that of a collective impulse focused on a representation of the self with respect to a representation of a world, understood by way of affective deviants that alter the basic elements of the real. In the case of the European Middle Ages - with the notable exception of England, which waited eight centuries before endowing itself with a literature illuminated by foundational myths via Tolkien - we can speak of the genesis and of the infancy of a literature as it relates to the naïve character of its protagonists, to the omnipresence of the supernatural and of magic in the works. The pretext for this is that this era is marked by fear linked to the hostile environment, as well as by faith, which is, effectively, a refuge from that fear inasmuch as it offers certainties that acquire meaning in and through the hopes that it creates. A need for respite from the present in order to exorcise the future. When an entire region, rallied around its Archbishop, builds a cathedral, it is always a gesture of gratitude for a wish granted or a</page><page sequence="2">Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? 41 quest for protection against future suffering. Man is, therefore, never really anything other than what he believes. What he believes attaches him to what he lives. What he lives is, astonishingly, what he fears. What he fears subverts the real-ness of the world around him, forces him to create a quite particular world, his world, by the perception he has of his own fragility with respect to the cruel environment that controls him. It's a vicious circle that leads from fear to fear, a sort of fetishization of the anxiety that determines the relationships between man and his surroundings and those set up alongside him in a closed universe, creating a field of prohibitions that oblige the individual to turn inward at the same time that he hopes to liberate his immediate environment in the quest for a less hostile elsewhere. He does not manage to do this other than by producing - by unleashing fantasies that metamorphosize his lived experience, that engender myths. Literature becomes an alibi - that is, the projection within a common frame of those special cases that make explicit the poverty of existence. Romanceros in Spain, French epic poems, sotties in France, for example, are exorcisms through which a hierarchized society, assembled around faith-based values, seeks to understand itself by establishing certain points of reference - anchoring in the substance of the folktale all the transfigurations it can conceive. As it begins to discover itself, this society throws off such reference points, traveling further and further into its religious fervor and quotidian preoccupations, rendering itself impermeable to the harshness of the environment so as to be entirely itself. Aspiring to another existence. This process of discovery - the brewing of pleasures, of joys, of comforts that modify the conditions of existence - confers on existence a meaning that no longer justifies fantasy. The Renaissance is not far behind. In Latin America, the literary landscape explodes everywhere at once. Fashioned, modeled by Europe of the Conquistadors but confronted by the inventive universe of the conquered, it long questioned its own authenticity. The space of popular expression extends to two continents, straddles five centuries of history, confronted from the very beginning by conflictual exchanges between the races. It is no longer a question, as in Europe during the Middles Ages, of a sterile literature, but of clashing aesthetics. In writing. In "oraliture" and the gestural. Between introversion and extroversion. Two ostensibly irreconcilable approaches to, and expressions of, the world. On the one hand, the obsoleteness of a realism transplanted to the New World in the intellectual baggage of intellectuals educated in Europe, uncomfortable in their own skin, uncomfortable with a nationalism needing to be invented in the face of the hegemonic intentions of an entrepreneurial North greedily consuming the rest of the world since the end of the 19th century. On the other hand, an enchanted contact with the natural world,</page><page sequence="3">42 Jean-Claude Fignolé its riches and its secrets, which translates not into the need to dominate but to commune with it in order to penetrate its very soul - to appropriate its spirit through the fascination of what is as much surrender as an enterprise of conquest. A game of seduction by which the indigenous person indeed submits himself to the natural order but appropriates its substratum - its essence - in order to depict it in what it possesses of the ceremonial and the factual. A certain knowledge and a certain power. Weaving together an authoritative package that can be assured through and in the taking on of secrets that guarantee the authenticity and the homogeneity of the societies in which they function. Throughout the centuries, the culture shock has been brutal, from the ferocity of the Conquistadors to the recent repression of the Guatemalan militias. Politics set the stage for barbarity, incidences of collective massacre legitimized by the Inquisition as early as the end of the 16th century were a first manifestation of European fascism that perpetuated itself through the collusion of international capital, politicians, and governments. This is what happened in Guatemala, in Brazil, and in Honduras, among others. The colonial past, and its clerical heritage, rejects any approach - even anthropological - to the mythical aspects of indigenous culture (I refuse to say religious, given that all religions are supported by myths) by qualifying them as superstitious practices. And yet these practices play an extremely important role in the definition and typology of Being in indigenous cultures. These cultures are defined by such things. They model themselves on such things. They distinguish themselves through such things. One might even say that the dominant culture, denouncing their natural-ness like some sort of condemnation, denied them any intentionality, any suggestion of solidarity or shared nature with the notion of Being as understood by those formed in the colonial system. For six centuries the two cultures rub shoulders while remaining ignorant of, if not outright denying, one another even though evangelical Christianity forced the indigenous peoples to suffer the most alienating dimension of the dominant culture: its religion. The resistance of the indigenous peoples to capitalism's agrarian, mercantile, mining, and industrial penetration in Central and South America - a capitalism that assuages its own guilt with its efforts to "vassalize" indigenous consciousness with an aggressive Protestantism - calls into question the 20th century nationalist struggle of the liberal bourgeoisie and the anti-imperialist struggle of the South American Left. The writers, progressive or revolutionary, convince themselves that bourgeois realism, a worn out form of expression, and social realism, a site-specific form of expression, are not appropriate to translate the human and historic experience of Latin American peoples trapped within a history of absolute</page><page sequence="4">Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? 43 domination and a politics of total exclusion. In Mexico, the struggles of Zapata; in Nicaragua, those of Sandino; Sertao's revolts in Brazil - all establish the limits of the complicity between History and Politics when faced with the emergence of peasant masses on the battlefields of protest and of revolt. The concept of popular struggle, later implemented by Mao in China, demonstrated from Indochina to Mozambique and Angola, passing through Algeria and Cuba, sets off the signal for the possible rallying together of a Leftist avant-garde and rural masses under the banner of protest linked to the need for an overthrowing of the political, social, and economic order. The political is reduced to contesting history, provoking a dynamic of solidarity between liberals from the Right, intelligentsia from the Left, peasant leaders, the rural world, reservoirs par excellence of illusions, of militants, and of combatants. Bourgeois from both the Right and the Left, middle classes uncomfortable in their own skin and with their means of self-expression discover a universe incubated in ancient civilizations reputed to be primitive, yet clearly articulated enough to enrapture Lévi-Strauss. Fascinated by this inverse of themselves so full of helpful instruction for their own progress toward the validation of their actions and of their way of being, they start paying attention to the indigenous people, who have turned into their people. They start paying attention also to a new frame of knowledge that, unable to truly understand, they inaccurately dub magic. They start paying attention also to techniques of expression that take their rhythm from music, their tempo from dance, their shimmer from painting. An expressive, even extravagant, approach to living, a cosmogony that turns the vision of their own interior world upside down and that they apply themselves to transcribing as rejuvenated forms of writing placed within narrative structures already tested out in the European novel. From Torotumbo to Legends of Guatemala and Men of Corn , Miguel Angel Asturias initiates the trend while waiting for García Márquez' One Hundred Tears of Solitude , which expands on the experiments of the La Onda ( The Wave) movement in Mexico and Mario Vargas Llosa's Conversation in the Cathedral , to explode traditional narrative structures and link the new expressive needs to the new storytelling techniques. Marvelous realism, such as it was invented by European theory, had found its frame and its drive. Alejo Carpentier, following a Haitian experience, captured Beings and Things in their extraordinariness and extravagance. Magic, because we must designate it as such, or, more specifically, the Marvelous as conceived by Carpentier, lapses into neurosis, fixing and sacralizing Beings and Things in the atemporality of narrative, in the irreality of the lived. In Haiti, ever since the beginning of the 20th century, the literary landscape has participated in the same historical symbolism as in Central</page><page sequence="5">44 Jean-Claude Fignolé America, overwhelmed as it is by the double burden of the American military occupation and the absence of a bourgeoisie committed to national interests. The failure of the Caco Revolt in 1919-1920 and of agrarian capitalism (SHADA)1 during World War II, the mobilization against the anti-superstition campaign, the constraints of the regime of Papa Doc and his abdication of sovereignty at Punta del Este do not presuppose a refusal of the imperialist domination that might have been consolidated in an alliance of intellectuals with the rural masses, lacking which, as they argue over details in their salons, these intellectuals begin to learn the virtues of whimpering or of boastfulness from within the discomfort of the Word. For nearly forty years. Intransigent in their inaction, they test their courage outside of any truly revolutionary struggle, seeking to base a capacity for resistance to the arrogance of the empire either in the passionate appropriation of France's language and culture or in the quest for an elusive Africa. A double example of their bad faith, as Sartre would have said. Or of their guilty conscience. From La Ronde, which, through Ussol's cry,2 proclaimed a French soul, to Indigenism, which lauded the return to, or rather the quest for, values inherited from Africa, liberal intellectuals from the both the Right and the Left (the latter rather scarce during the 1930s and 1950s, frankly) get along, paradoxically, by anathematizing one another so as to live out identity crises that, while seemingly opposed, in fact bring them to mystify themselves by mystifying their people. A drifting quality of inner being that enables them to abandon the battlefields. They lose themselves more than they discover themselves. Lost in its European and then colonial wars, France is far away. The USSR even further. Same for Africa, which only very slowly begins to believe in its own political emancipation. Leftists from the Right, Rightists from the Left, amateur anarchists wear themselves out, battle each other, through and within the Word, adding to the cacophony, to the confusion of their language, the confusion of their intelligence. Behind a screen of ideology or colorful fantasies. Without, at any point, doubting the legitimacy of their arguments. Or doubting themselves. From all of this hullabaloo emerges Jacques Roumain. Starting out with a taste for Maurras then explicitly choosing communism, pushed to syndicalism by a desire to test out his convictions, he only knows members of the peasantry to the extent afforded by his hunting excursions with the brothers Savain or Marcelin. That is, until the day when Pétion Savain, author of the noteworthy La Case de Damballah , gives him a text to read that will become, quite fortunately, Gouverneurs de la Rosée. The militant worker, by means of this reading, discovers the rural world. The intellectual archeologist hunting for pre-Columbian vestiges in the countryside becomes</page><page sequence="6">Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? 45 more and differently interested by this world. The communist ideologue takes stock of the injustice of rural conditions. The novelist, subjugated by the fantastic universe of fairytales and the colorful richness of the language, initiates an aesthetic that, for generations, will influence the development of the Haitian novel and will determine its fluctuations. The Left had found a territory to explore in the absence of a cause and a people. It succeeded in folklorizing rural life and in making it the approximate site of Haitian popular art and culture. Novelists from the Left, such as Edris Saint-Amand,3 carry on the line of Jacques Roumain, modeling the stereotype of the positive hero in the socialist novel on the values of a rural world that they know little about. Out of this comes an adjustment to the model of the hero, as a consequence of the aesthetic that fashions him, through the caricature of the customs of the peasantry for which the School of the Griots later claims to have come up with the socio-ethnographic profile. The result is a typology of "miserabilism," an aesthetic of degradation, to borrow Lyonel Trouillot's formulation, from which the contemporary Haitian novel has not completely freed itself. Jacques Stephen Alexis sees an impasse and a dilemma in this, and he rearranges them in an ideological context. Historical head of the Party for Popular Understanding, more affiliated with the philosophy of Moscow than that of Peking, he denies the peasant masses any capacity for leading a revolutionary movement, preferring to look to a hypothetical alliance with "intellectuals from the Left, liberal bourgeois, revolutionary workers" for the avant-garde of a bourgeois revolution, first but indispensable step according to him toward a future proletarian revolution. Who does not remember his famous polemic with Dépestre on the strategy to adopt after the 1957 elections, in which the choice between Déjoie and Duvalier was posed unequivocally? Opting for the progressive intrusion of a proletarian worker in the game of politics, Jacques Stephen Alexis chose to place his positive hero in an urban rather than a rural setting ( Compère Général Soleil and L'Espace d'un cillement are testaments to this), only to become aware - upon his contact with the emerging literatures of Latin America - of the limitations of social realism, of its incapacity to account for and to accurately depict the lived experience and sociological reality of the global South. Les Arbres musiciens marks the first indication of this in his novelistic universe prior to his adoption in Romancéro aux étoiles* of a shortcut through which to define a new realism between the mental schema at once faithful to his communist leanings and innovations borrowed from his Latino cousins. He barters the concept of Alejo Carpentieri Marvelous Real for that of Marvelous Realism, far, very far, from the Cuban novelist's initial idea.</page><page sequence="7">46 Jean-Claude Fignolé Let us listen to him advise Haitian novelists to sing the beauties of the Haitian homeland, its wonders as well as its misery, with the sense of the grandiose perspectives that underlie the struggles of its people and sense of solidarity with all mankind; to thereby get in touch with humanity, the universal, the profound truth of existence; to reject art without real social content, to seek out the expressive terms that are authentic to their people - that which corresponds to its psychic sense - while at the same time utilizing in a renewed, expanded form the universal molds that suit, of course, the personality of each creator; to have a clear awareness of the precise, concrete, current problems and real dramas that confront the masses, with the aim of reaching - of more profoundly cultivating - the people, and engaging them in their struggles. . . Elsewhere, he adds: "As a function of particular disciplines, various aspects will need to be more precisely articulated, but only a deeper discussion will allow us to really get to the truth. It is not a simple thing to advance along the path of this sort of realism." At which point he cries out: "Long live a living realism, linked to the magic of the universe, a realism that shakes up not only the spirit but the heart and the entire nervous system."5 The flamboyant style, the pompous, pretentious rhetoric, makes the text more of a political, than literary, manifesto and does not fail to entrap the theorist. If it is necessary to establish points of reference, one might say the declamatory outbursts of the Patriotic School slip into the universalist drive of La Ronde before drifting toward the identitary pitfalls that smack of Indigenist essentialism. The whole thing sprinkled with flakes of social realism and a hefty dose of militantism that a discreet wink at "the magic of the universe" does not manage to attenuate. Jacques Stephen Alexis, enacting the dogma of his literary doctrine, forgets to be the head of an aesthetic movement and so ends up merely leading a party. Under the pretext of sounding the depths, of mythifying the text, he manages only to mystify the writer and to make of him, outside of the written, a positivist writer who loses his creative freedom and bends to dictates whose end result is to homogenize literary production by giving it, from one novelist to the next, the bearing and the tone of a proletarian catechism. Did he not remember that it was in the name of the marvelous real and of artistic freedom that Alejo Carpentier had so vehemently condemned the "paper scratchers" who contented themselves "with replacing magic tricks with the commonplaces of the engaged writer?" in 1948? Probably, yes, but in his quest for a new aesthetic, Jacques Stephen does not refrain from militancy;</page><page sequence="8">Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? 47 he does not keep himself from becoming a Leftist ideologue. He does not prevent himself from becoming victim of a perhaps poorly processed culture. His approaches drift between different schools, between different experiences out of which he never manages to make a happy synthesis. On one side, nostalgia for the classical - insufficiently examined - drives him to take up the theses of bourgeois literature from the period when Europe was experiencing, at the end of the 19th and first half of the 20th century, its unilateral domination of the world and imposing the notion of universal man, of the universal values of civilisation, of progress, of liberalism as well as of exploitation under God's complicit gaze. Following the example of a few of the great marginalized of the French system, he gets used to denouncing. Jacques Stephen Alexis navigates smoothly between Hugo and Zola. On the other hand, ideological and revolutionary engagement conditions his vision of the positive hero, his solidarity with all exploited peoples, new model of man that also has its eye on the universal. The global revolution demands it. But the gestation and birth are laborious. Hilarión and El Gaucho seem to emerge straight out of Germinal rather than Quiet Flows the Don 6 and the problem of social injustice hearkens back to Victor Hugo's Les Misérables. More so than any third-rate work of Socialist Realism. Thank goodness... The pursuit, the quest for the Marvelous in a realism yet to be reinvented forces him to question the intentions of his art and to define it with respect to the traditions of his people, with respect to a popular poetics waiting to be investigated, elaborated, divulged. But which one? "A realism that reaches the masses," he proclaims. Easier said than done. Worked up by the flights of his prose, Jacques Stephen never stops to consider a major pitfall. His culture, reinforced by his intellectual learning and his experiences as a militant, does not help him fill what's lacking: to understand, to truly know his people and its mythologies, which the writer must no longer imprison in a reductive vision of a few vodou ceremonies dedicated to papa loas as in Gouverneurs de la rosée . The party leader in him could not be satisfied by a few encounters with various specimens of workers and students here and there - over a bottle of rum - as the grounds on which to create an entire people. On which to elect these individuals "the people." Nor could the novelist in him be satisfied by gleaning here and there a few stories told by wet nurses in order to assimilate them, as he puts it, "to the imagery within which a people envelops its experience, reflects its conception of the world and of existence, its faith, its hope, its trust in mankind - in a sense of higher justice and in the explanation that it finds for those forces antagonistic to progress." Jacques mixes everything up, proposing a sort of metaphysics of expression that finds justification in itself. Faith. Hope. Belief. Forces antagonistic to progress. And to top it off! A sense of higher justice. Might</page><page sequence="9">48 Jean-Claude Fignolé the theorist, for whom all justice should be class justice, have been recalling the notion of immanent justice with which priests and religious figures overwhelmed his childhood? The leftovers from catechism lessons stay fresh in his mind. Too much so perhaps. Never mind. If for the demands of the struggle, the people (a loaded term) has embraced its leader, then the latter, for reasons linked undoubtedly to the obligations of clandestinity under the dictatorship, was unable to fully embrace the people in return - to live the people's quotidian, accompany and orient its lived experience, interrogate its beliefs, identify and catalogue its customs, question its practices, its continuous contacts with existence, its reactions with respect to its immediate environment and to the world. Jacques Stephen the novelist lacked the possibility of getting out of himself in order to move toward the other, to anticipate his people - the people so precious to the militant - so as to discover its multiple human dimensions beyond that of "the exploited." This lack probably established the limits of the reflections of Alexis the theorist, doctrinarian, and leader of an aesthetic movement. When, in an effort to explain or justify his aesthetic choices in "Where is the Novel Going?," an article published in Présence Africaine, Jacques Stephen endorses the novel as the "conciliation of the imaginary and the real," does the word "conciliation" satisfyingly communicate the finality of the novel when we know that the novel is first and foremost - if not to say fundamentally - the space of a fiction? That is, the frame of an invented and imagined tale that, thanks to the talent of the author, to his capacity for suggestion, to the artifices of his language, would have the virtue of simulating - of evoking - the real. Even when it is a question of autobiography, rather than point out all the elements of fantasy that would strain the credibility of the author's story, does contemporary criticism not prefer to give credit to the author by considering his text a work of auto- fiction? As if, by virtue of that word, the author might accord himself the right to invent. Better to speak, then, of a "fiction of the self." The novel, and by extension literature as a whole, is then no more than an impossible real. What matters then, above all, is invention. It is the greatest part of dreams, of the novelistic (in the original sense of the term) as instances of suggestion and evasion, of re-creation and of recreation. It provokes the imagination of the reader, unleashes it so as either to align it with that of the author or to explode it and invest it in interpretation and exegesis, other territories of the imaginary that involve, simply reading a novel in a continuous process of invention. The act of reading, a quest for sense and meaning, is ultimately no more than an exercise in virtual rewriting within the jumble of multiple interrogations of a text.</page><page sequence="10">Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? 49 Let us return to Jacques Stephen Alexis. The definition of the novel that he proposes is meant to be an explanation of his expression "marvelous realism," of which the terms, in their initial formulation break with common sense. If we know to what to link Jacques' intentions as regards his choice of the term "Realism," we still wonder about his choice of the qualifier "Marvelous." Does it accurately express that which Jacques believes he is defining? Above all, is it appropriate? I tend to think not! Trapped by nostalgia for the classical or ideological, ceding to the easy option offered by Carpentier, he refuses to question the reality of his land, that of the global South, in order to judge and to gauge this disorder, this explosion of the senses that troubles common sense, that gives the majority of Latin American novels (those of Argentina seem often to be the exception) their foreign and unreal character. In having recourse to the Marvelous, Jacques chooses to ignore the fact that this term cannot claim to account for the reality that he means to theorize. Marvelous, whatever its field of application, references an enchanted world where the sacred mixes with the supernatural and the magical, spreads to the credulity of crowds, stamps consciences with the seal of naïveté. That is why "Faith and Mysteries" were the keywords of an art that developed out of the churches before profaning itself as the demands of life turned the hopeful wishes of the faithful toward the most basic necessities of existence. To postulate the Marvelous as yeast, as motive force of novelistic intention in Haiti during the second half of the 20th century, implied advising novelists to return to Faith and the Sacred as aesthetic alibis, as dynamics of invention. Alejo Carpentier had in fact predicted as much when he wrote: "the sensation of the Marvelous presupposes faith." Would it be, then, out of faith that Jacques approached literature, and the novel in particular - in order to define and impose an outdated notion, a church-born aesthetic? No one knows, aside from thinking that Jacques lived Marxism as a religion and that, as a result, he asked that literature provide him with the certainty of action and of hope that he lacked or that escaped him on the battlefield of militancy. With regard to his narrative technique, the double temptation of bourgeois realism and socialist realism in Alexis5 postulations, establishes a certain diversion if not a distraction, in the Pascalian sense of the term, that corresponds neither to the theorist's vision nor to the illusions of the ideologue. At a moment when, after World War II, the anti-colonial struggles demanded that one provoke the consciousness of Third World peoples by awakening them to all political forms of lucidity, how could one suggest to the novelist that he propose to his Haitian readers, within the frame of a call for solidarity amongst the various peoples, that they amuse themselves with an aesthetic of naïveté, if not to say non-lucidity par excellence ?</page><page sequence="11">50 Jean-Claude Fignolé Jacques Stephen Alexis gets out of it with a clever move. Crystallizing all popular beliefs in the idea of vodou (the foundation of national culture according to the preaching of Indigenism), at the cost of a regrettable confusion of popular beliefs developed by mythologies and religious beliefs wrapped in naïve fervor, he grasps onto the phenomenological dimension of this religion. Neglecting to question its cosmogony in order to extract the life charge and the pedagogical value, he sees only a collection of superstitions, likely to stoke the gullibility of some and the naïveté of others, and that constitutes the opiate of the people, as denounced by the well-known Marxist postulate. Might as well say he puts the brakes on the dynamization of a national revolutionary process. "It is necessary to destroy superstitious beliefs with education," he proclaims in protest of the anti-superstitious campaign. Did he even understand that this campaign, in destroying cult objects, was completely monstrous in light of the sacred art of vodou, whose great value was recently affirmed by an international exhibition, and that these objects bore witness to that which is most profound and most alive in mankind: its capacity for faith? Most creative, too? And that these objects constitute the medium that enable man to reinvent himself by inventing an alternative existence? Jacques' protestations do not prevent the categorical condemnation of vodou. For good reason, the ideologue drains it of its sacredness. But paradoxically, he recovers, for aesthetic purposes, the supernatural likely to nourish the fantasies of the faithful and thus of the collective imaginary, the "ancestral metaphysics," as he puts it, forgetting that, for the faithful, the belief in the supernatural is the antechamber of the sacred. No matter! It is sufficient, he believes, to remove "the mystical outer layer" from the marvelous - to "put it back on its feet (the nod to Marx with respect to the Hegelian dialectic) and not to let it behave irrationally in some supra-natural fashion." What heedlessness - or rather what an excess of confidence! "It is sufficient!" How does that suffice? "It is sufficient." It's clear. Categorical. "It is sufficient." I hesitate to credit Jacques with a project for reeducation that might call up the ghosts of the Red Guards and Pol Pot, but (and there's always a but), let us suppose that he'd managed to eliminate (in one way or another) "ancestral metaphysics," as he puts it. Did he realize that the day such a thing happened he would have eliminated, Alexis-style, the marvelous itself- that it would no longer exist? And that his theory would no longer be either a justification or a legitimation of literary production as he envisioned it? The best aesthetic intentions would not be enough to give the Marvelous a meaning to which nothing, other than the fantasies of authors and critics, predisposed it. Unless, out of the predictable shipwreck of the Marvelous, in putting it back on its feet, Jacques sees the necessary</page><page sequence="12">Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? 5 1 conditions for moving beyond the contradiction at the very heart of his formulation "Marvelous Realism." The Promethean aesthetic that Jacques the novelist promised himself would then have foundered in the Marxist doctrine of Alexis the pontiff. At this level of questioning, does Alexis's realism not seem to chase after an unlikely, an improbable, marvelous? Other than to create an ontology of the marvelous in Haitian letters. Which would happen by itself. And within itself. Other than, above all, to hold onto and point out, in the context of folktales and certain Haitian novels, the foundational belief system - lycanthropy, witchcraft, anthropomorphism - and their exploitation with respect to universal literature, which would be as the infancy of art - "A fundamental need to set the real within the limits of a perception that metamorphosizes and transfigures it. This need and this perception end up giving the real an identity made up of diverse, imperfectly transmissible phenomena" - and which might hearken back to an expression, a testament, to a way of knowing that has emerged from the dark night of the past, perpetuating itself in the memory or, rather, in the collective unconscious in the form of a nostalgia that dares not speak its name. The Marvelous would be related, then, to a poetic of the "Known" and the "Forgotten;" to a culture of neurosis and of a sense of metamorphosis that takes its specificity from memories, from residues of consciousness that, in order to survive, take care not to call intelligence into question. Alejo Carpentier, in this he is consistent with respect to his own principles, posits an unexplained reality, mythifies the peculiar, claims to inscribe the unexplained and the peculiar within a cosmogony that would expand the mythological capital of peoples of the Americas. For him, "the marvelous begins to be obvious when it comes to an unexpected alteration of reality (the miraculous); when it is a case of a privileged revelation of reality- of an inhabitual illumination or one that is singularly responsive to the unnoticed riches of reality; an expansion of the scales and categories of reality perceived with a particular intensity by virtue of an exaltation of the spirit that leads it to a sort of borderline state." Here we are far, very far - at the antipodes, even - of Alexis5 stated intentions and ideological approach. Make no mistake, the Marvelous only exists as a part of reality - a modification, a transformation, a transfiguration of reality, in the alchemical sense of the term, a transmutation through conditions external to that reality that, provoking intelligent consciousness, explode, capsize into the realm of the imagined. Or into the oneiric. Intelligence no longer questions the world. It accepts it, envisions it, believes in it insofar as the rupture with consciousness obliges. Phantasmagorical. What happens to those simple superstitious beliefs, Alexis' ancestral metaphysics, when</page><page sequence="13">52 Jean-Claude Fignolé one witnesses a complete upsetting of the spirit in the propagation of certainties that end up developing a collective schizophrenia? The world is lived in duplicate, triplicate, multiplícate, in its initial reality as well as and above all in the diverse metamorphoses that the spirit confers upon it and that, in the end, become more real than the real itself. In this respect, the Marvelous, or what Jacques Stephen Alexis has designated as such, far from the primordial reality that underlies it, is connected as much to psychoanalysis as to psychiatry. It is in this, in fact, far removed from ideological and militant interpretations, in this alone, through its power to explode our fields of perception that, multiplied song of the world, it invokes literature. Only literature? Why not science, too? When René Dépestre tells the story of Hadriana's zombification in Hadriana dans tous mes rêves and Frankétienne that of the revolt of the zombies of Bois Neuf, when Margaret Papillon, in a short story published in the daily paper Le Matin reports the story of the phantasmagorical creature of Les Abricots, when in Les Passagers du temps , I tell the tale of a man transformed into an ox, the immediate reaction is always to cry magic or marvelous realism, to box us up in a tacky exoticism, as if our works were one-way tickets on an enchanted cruise ship. When Sylvie Germain in Les Nuits makes use of the medieval marvelous in the fantastic aspects of her tale, with a welcome narrative joy as a matter of fact, the critics don't say anything about fantastic, magic, or marvelous realism. They speak only of the novelist's prodigious capacity for inventing myths. If one need go back in time to explore the foundations of the Greek world, when for them the legends of divinities mapped out the story of men, the metamorphoses of the gods do not invoke the marvelous, at any point, but engender myths that Homer, Aeschylus, and Euripides' dazzling tales maintain as their mythological capital. Why then, given similar or nearly similar inventive temptations, are we left with marvelous realism as sufficient reason to place us in a position of absolute difference, with the sole objective being to persuade us that we are Other- to limit us to our "natural-ness," a particular aptitude for perceiving the world differently, for reinventing it. An aptitude that psychiatrists would qualify as morbid in order to explain its capacity for denaturing the real, structuring an imaginary that paradoxically defies all sense of coherence while bearing its own logic. And if we weren't actually "other?" Or rather, and if we really were others? And if these stories that seem extraordinary and fantastical to a spirit that considers itself rational weren't, on the contrary, anything more than so many banal anecdotes based in the lived experience of Haitians rather than their collective imagination? And if certain of these stories,</page><page sequence="14">Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? 53 far from being fables, were precise accountings of the permanence of the affirmation of a science that would implicate bio-technology and that might set off the great scientific revolution of the 21st century? And if the fantastic and the magical connected with the real so as to impose upon it the traces of a knowledge that dated back to the origin of the world? Let us leave for a moment the realm of literature and enter that of science and of myths that appear new because they are, paradoxically, so ancient. New because explanation or scientific experimentation accord them the right to a different power of expression. Of suggestion. And of signification. Who does not know the stories of zombies and bakas? They filled the nights of our childhood with terror, causing our longstanding fear of the dark, of the evil spells of the living dead and of shape-shifters created by evil sorcerers, we believe, from a chicken egg. These stories, particularly those of zombies, no longer belong to the domain of the imaginary and of our fantasies ever since they have started becoming top stories in the news on occasion, uncovering a veritable slave trafficking ring under the cloak of magic and the supernatural. Oh, come on! Magic and the supernatural? Not at all. For reasons linked most likely to misinformation and to ignorance regarding the zombie phenomenon, Haitians and foreigners have quite unfortunately associated these stories with vodou practices as a primary site of distasteful activity. Forced into clandestinity by Toussaint Louverture's decree during the colonial period, threatened by the wrath of Christianity during the 1940s, the popular image has portrayed vodou as a secretive religion that masks all sorts of wrongdoing. Yet zombification has nothing to do with vodou. According to the research of Harry Charles, a young doctor from Jérémie who died far too young, zombification was introduced in Hispaniola by indigenous peoples of the Canary Islands and of the Azores, themselves imported from Guinea Bissau. Marooning alongside other Indians and Africans, these peoples shared the techniques - I very purposely use the term "techniques" - related to zombification and set themselves to inventorying and identifying the toxic plants of Quisqueya, initiating, before Mackandal, a basic knowledge of tropical toxicology. These indigenous peoples were called "Bijagós," masters of life and death, out of which came the term "Bizangos," a label we hear currently in certain parts of the Artibonite region and in the foothills of Matheux. An oceanic people, possessors of a knowledge of terrifying power, the Bijagós taught the Indians and Africans how to extract the toxic substance from the sub-cutaneous alveoli where one finds the stingers of a poison commonly known as a "twenty-four hours" that, upon contact with the skin, penetrates the pores, infiltrates the blood all the way to the brain, infects the neurons, and upsets mainly those nerve centers that control memory</page><page sequence="15">54 Jean-Claude Fignolé and free will. Certain Japanese laboratories, working from the studies of a Doctor Douyon, have identified the nature of the substance and expect to be able to create it themselves. They are already beginning to imagine the potential use this substance might offer in the domain of neurosurgery or in the treatment of certain ailments, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, for example, by allowing doctors to work directly on the cells in order to neutralize them and halt the progression of the illness. An undisputed medical advancement with the potential for great financial profits from which, unfortunately, Haiti will not benefit, given the state of scientific research at the university level in Haiti, and given the secrecy under which this research is being carried out elsewhere, most likely unknown to any of the authorities in our country. With all the phantasmagorical stories going around, of which the most famous and the most well-known is certainly that of Toussaint Louverture, we exchange the realm of research and scientific certainties for that of hypothesis. But are not hypotheses generally the starting point for scientific research and discovery? Our quotidian is filled with stories of people who disappear at will, traveling from one place to another in defiance of space and time. So many tall tales? I wouldn't swear on it. During a period when it took me six hours of driving to make a round-trip between Jérémie and Les Abricots, it took Ernest Mauger only forty-seven minutes, on my request, when he made the trip to have a piece of my cane grinder repaired. He returned from his trip all smiles, excusing himself for having taken so long. He'd had to pick up the solderer in Gebo, an hour away from Jérémie, the latter having insisted on driving him back on his motorcycle. "Had that not happened?" I asked. "The whole thing would only have taken a few seconds," he retorted with a smile meant to taunt me. Or to provoke my curiosity. Leaving me with questions and conjectures regarding the significant good fortune he had, knowing how to and being able to defy the laws of nature. At no point did I believe in the supernatural, even when the strangeness of the situation led me to consider it. Neither did I entertain the idea of the magical even though the power was unseen. I thought about the kind of knowledge Ernest possessed and mastered - a knowledge outside the mysteries of the great laboratories of the West; a simple knowledge that certainly owed its efficiency to this very simplicity. And this knowledge unsettles my intelligence, at the risk of causing its total breakdown. Fortunately, science - through the physics of plasma - allows me to put together an explanation. At very high voltages and, therefore, very high temperatures, by inverting an electrode on a metallic surface (I am simplifying, of course), one can create a space in an electromagnetic field within which all the physical properties of matter are abolished. An</page><page sequence="16">Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? 55 absolute void, if not to say a state of nothingness. The result? Space is abstracted in time. Neither distance nor duration count. As if, the one reduced to the other, they were compressed in an immobility that denied them both. Speed is freed henceforth from the constraints of resistance and reduces the time of displacement to its simplest expression. Between zero and a thousand kilometers, there is no longer any difference. Nor is there a difference between a second and an hour. Might this be an explanation for flying saucers? American aeronautic companies working with university researchers work very hard to answer this question for the Pentagon. But what about Ernest Mauger? And the other phantasmagorical creatures? If one considers only the discoveries of plasma physics, one understands that their knowledge would have allowed them to cancel out the effects of two physical laws, those that concern resistance and heat. As regards the first, one wonders how. As regards the second, the Kanzo phenomenon in vodou and even further, much further back in time (that of the burning bush in the Bible) lead one to believe that, from the effect of unknown causes, calorific energy can heat without burning. Sorcery? Miracle? Myths have hard lives. Scientists are patient, tenacious, and stubborn. It will be ultimately be understood. The spell of all spells remains to be investigated: the capacity to change species within the animal world. To mutate. It would seem that's a common occurrence in Haiti. The ox one brings to the slaughterhouse is that guy Jean Something-or-other who died last week after having been disrespectful to the village zobop . That cat meowing at night on your roof is the next door neighbor who's come to put a curse on your business. Any rational spirit would never give any credit whatsoever to such nonsense despite the rumors circulating here and there that from time to time dare to present themselves as certainties. I remember that general panic at the market in Jérémie. I was ten years old at the time and I was going to class. The market women were fleeing in every direction, abandoning their stands, crying "Malediction! Malediction!" The reason? Clarifon Semexant, butcher by trade, was about to slaughter a newly purchased ox when, to his great surprise, the animal mooed, so revealing its "gums" and two golden teeth. True? Not true? The village talked about it for days and refused to eat beef sold by Clarifon. Progressively, the rumors dried up. Fears dissipated. Clarifon continued to prosper. True or not true? That isn't the question. The important thing is to know whether, outside of centuries-old myths, mutations are possible in the animal kingdom. Biogenetics leads us to think so. Research on horses in the Lakes Region of Africa have revealed, incidentally, that the DNA chain of a certain race of mares is identical (differing by a single molecule) to that of German women in the Rhine</page><page sequence="17">56 Jean-Claude Fignolé valley. It would suffice to invert the molecules in the order of the chain and thus to modify the genetic code for a female Rhinelander to become a female horse. The reverse also being possible, naturally. We all know the expression "German mare." It's a colloquial expression that applies to tall women, superbly proportioned, sculptural, made for being mounted by expert riders. Might these women have perpetuated in the collective memory the trace of the manipulation, by a libidinous African sorcerer, of the DNA chain of these horses from the shores of the Zambezi in order to engender a bipedal species that might have ended up in Germany as a result of the random migrations obliged by climactic changes? Bets have been placed on such million-dollar questions. Even if the question brings a little smile, it leads also to evidence. Genetic manipulations, since Dolly, open the way to infinite possibilities that risk, in the short term, confirming certainties acquired through secret sources of knowledge that refuse to reveal themselves for ethical reasons that cannot be divulged because of the terrible powers involved. Might Haitians have inherited this knowledge? Difficult to respond - other than hoping this is so. Biogenetics is the science of the future and biotechnologies (notably the genetic manipulations they will produce - that they have already produced), will be sources of wealth and power for the countries that develop them. Buried in its "natural-ness" and its mythologies, might Haiti, despite itself, without knowing it and above all without believing it, have pulled ahead of the rest of the world? Why? How could such a thing possibly have happened? At this junction, even if we have no responses to these questions, must we continue to speak about the Marvelous in our novels? Or about superstitious popular beliefs in our critical interrogations? Assuredly not. It is not a question of the imaginary but of science that enables us, Jules Verne style, to anticipate the future, to invent myths emerging from the rationality of a universe yet to be discovered, to be mastered. Biochemistry, biogenetics and its technologies, plasma physics are all beginning to make known that which appeared to be unknowable and led men to doubt their own reason, their own intelligence, led them to look for and to find, in the panoply of their anxieties, an irrational explanation for the multiple possible metamorphoses of the real. What role will fall on literature when, most probably, science will have invaded and annexed certain spaces of our myths? None, other than that it will accord itself as always the capacity, the power, the never-relinquished authority to imagine and to recount the world that remains little revealed to us. There will still be other unknowns that will call out to us, that will trouble us, other unknowns that will make the world seem unknowable again. It will be more than ever before the new world that is born of new fantasies of the popular imaginary, of their</page><page sequence="18">Marvelous Realism! Metamorphosis of the Real? 57 perfect concordance with those of future novelists. A perpetually new world. Always to be created. Always to be better known. A world that will oblige us - in order to understand its meaning, in order to give it some meaning - to increase, to augment, to expand our stock of mythologies. We needed mythologies to survive in, and despite, the hell of colonial existence, despite dictatorships, despite misery, despite our sufferings as a people. Despite our sufferings as men. Despite our suffering beings. We will survive. We will continue to survive by creating new mythologies with each new circumstance, as long as our voices orchestrate the many different sounds of our earth. As long as we situate those sounds, loud and strong, in the immense clamor of the wider world. In the superb adventure of the Word.
