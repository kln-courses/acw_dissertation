<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Audience for "Primitive" Art in Houses in the New York Region David Halle Why, in the twentieth century, did Westerners begin to see "tribal" objects as "art?" During the previous century, ethno- graphic museums often preserved "tribal" objects and pre- sented them, in Darwinian terms, as indicators of the technological level reached by the societies that produced them. Earlier, they had been for the most part either ignored or viewed with horror as examples of pagan idol worship.' Although the terms "tribal" and "primitive" are notori- ously unsatisfactory as applied to art, it is notoriously hard to find more satisfactory ones for discussing the reception of the artifacts in the twentieth-century West. I use the words here because this is a study of the audience for "tribal" art, and these are the categories around which the interest of twentieth-century audiences in the artifacts was typically organized.2 In explaining why Westerners came to view "tribal" arti- facts as art, it was common until recently to highlight the aesthetic acumen of certain artists, directors of cultural institutions, and critics. Little was said about the rest of the audience that viewed and purchased the objects. A few vanguard figures-Picasso, Matisse, Apollinaire, and others- "discovered" the aesthetic merits of African and Oceanic masks and figure sculptures in 1906-07, making this a particularly important period according to the conventional view.3 Proponents of this view go on to emphasize the recognition, by the directors of select galleries and art museums, of the aesthetic merit of "primitive" art.4 Exam- ples of such recognition in the United States, all located in New York, include Alfred Steiglitz's display of African figures at his gallery "291" in 1914, the first exhibition anywhere of African sculpture as art; the Museum of Modern Art's "African Negro Art" of 1935, which recognized "primitive" art's influence on modern painting and sculpture;5 the opening of the Museum of Primitive Art in New York in 1957, the first American museum devoted to "primitive" art; and, in the late 1960s, the Metropolitan Museum of Art's agreement to take over the Museum of Primitive Art and to build a special section to house it. This last decision was hailed by Nelson Rockefeller, whose private collection had formed the nucleus of the old Museum of Primitive Art, as the end of a long struggle to place "tribal" art on an equal aesthetic footing with the great arts of the world. He commented: "[Now] the long-neglected creative work of the so-called primitive artists of Africa, the Americas, and the islanders of the Pacific ... will be available side by side with the best creative work of Egyptian, Near Eastern, Greek, Roman, Asian, European, American, and modern artists.6 Recently, a group of critics, including James Clifford, J.C.H. King, and Aldona Jonaitis, have challenged the view that "primitive" art became accepted in the West mainly for reasons of aesthetics. These critics have pointed to a political- ideological motive in the display of "primitive" art, specifi- cally in Western museums. They argue that these museum exhibitions typically suggest that the artistic and cultural life of "tribal" ("non-Western") societies climaxed in a "traditional" ("pre-Western contact") past, and that in adopt- ing Western ideas and materials, this artistic life degenerates and is absorbed. Thus museum displays imply that "tribal" This article is based on research for my forthcoming book, Inside Culture: Art and Class in the Modern American Home, University of Chicago Press. For their helpful comments, I wish to thank Richard Brilliant, and an anonymous reviewer for The Art Bulletzn. ' On this general history, see Goldwater, Rubin, the essays in G. Stocking, ed., Objects and Others: Essays on Museums and Materzal Culture, Madison, Wisc., 1985, and M. Ames, Cannzbal Tours and Glass Boxes: The Anthropology of Museums, Vancouver, 1992. In a brief, and well-known, interlude, the treasures sent back from Mexico by the Spanish conquista- dores in 1519 astounded select Europeans such as Diirer, supposedly for their aesthetic qualities. But the idea that these objects were art soon lapsed; tribal objects continued to be viewed in the European Renais- sance merely as exotica in the "cabinets de curiosites" of princes. For skepticism about whether Ddrer et al. really prized the items for their aesthetic value, see C. Feest, who argues that Diirer was simply impressed by the "sheer value of these things, their sometimes exotic raw materials, and their obvious craftsmanship." See Feest's "From North America," in Rubin, 85-99. In fact, a small number of Western travellers before the 20th century dzd see aesthetic value in "tribal" objects. For references, see below n. 37. 2 This is one reason why I put the terms in quotation marks. I also use them to distance myself from some of the (untenable) implications about the artifacts, and about the societies that produced them, accompanying the use of these terms. For a discussion of "primitive" and "tribal," and of the difficulty of finding better categories when considering the reception of the artifacts in the 20th-century West, see Rubin, 1-11. 3So standard is this account that James Clifford (p. 196ff) has called it the "origin story of modernism." The "tribal" objects found by Picasso and the others were available in European curiosity shops as well as in ethnographic museums such as the Trocadero in Paris. 4For the history that follows in this paragraph, see D. Newton, Masterpieces of Prizmtive Art, New York, 1978, including the introduction by Nelson Rockefeller; and D. Newton, J.Jones, and S. Vogel, "The Stuff That Wasn't in the Metropolitan: Notes on Collecting Primitive Art," in T. Hoving ed., The Chase, the Capture: Collecting at the Metropolztan, New York, 1975. 5The Denver Art Museum was the first art museum in the United States to recognize "primitive" art. In 1923 the Department of Ethnology of the Brooklyn Museum mounted "Primitive Negro Art," a large show of almost 1,500 Congolese objects of all kinds. And an exhibition called "Rare African Sculpture," which presented its material almost entirely as aesthetic objects, opened on Fifty-seventh Street in Manhattan in 1930. 6 Nelson Rockefeller, "Introduction," in Newton (as in n. 4), 24. A more recent landmark in the aesthetic career of "primitive" art in America was the Museum of Modern Art's exhibition of 1984, " 'Primitivism' in 20th Century Art," which documented the supposed affinities between "tribal" and modern art. For criticisms of the assumptions made by this exhibition, see Clifford, and A.

But their writings highlight a lacuna in both explanations. This is the role of the audience, which appears to be a more or less passive recipient in their view. In the traditional explanation, the audience follows and validates the aesthetic judgments of artists and other experts. In the more recent explanation, the audience is dominated by the ideologically motivated manipulations of museums and their directors. Although seeing the audience for "primitive" art as the target of manipulation by institutional forces is new, the general idea that the audience for culture is manipulated by larger forces, typically by corporations and their allies on Madison Avenue, is a familiar one from theories of "mass culture," as well as from the "Frankfurt School" of social theory.8 Yet over twenty years ago, Leo Steinberg protested against the tendency to treat the audience for art as passive and unimportant. He wrote: "May we not the drop this useless, mythical distinction between-on one side-creative, for- ward-looking individuals whom we call artists, and-on the other side-a sullen, anonymous, uncomprehending mass, whom we call the public?"9 Indeed, thus far unexamined is the possibility that the audience in the West that views and purchases "tribal" art participates in a process whereby new meanings, unforeseen by Western artists and critics, emerge, meanings that consequently influence the course of cultural history via their impact on the kind of "primitive" art now demanded by the purchasing and museum-going audience. It is this possibility that I will explore in this paper. "Tribal" Art and the Western House One reason for the limited role assigned to the audience in the history of the reception of "primitive" art in the West is that researchers have focused on "tribal" objects in the Western museum or gallery, rather than on what is in fact a central context for "tribal" art in the modern West-the private house.'0 In museum or gallery displays, the audience typically does not play any direct role in determining the content and organization of the objects it views. But by contrast, in the modern Western house the main audience for the "tribal" objects displayed-the residents-are also the people responsible for the selection and display of the objects. It is therefore less plausible to imply that their part in the process of assigning meaning is passive. There are, in fact, historical reasons for assigning a central place to the study of "primitive" art in the modern residence. Long before the objects of "tribal" societies found their new places in major Western art museums, they had already made their way into private homes. As Susan Vogel, Director of the Museum for African Art in Manhattan, has written: "Until the 1970s, except for sporadic art exhibitions and natural history museum displays in a few large cities, little African art was to be seen in America if it was not in private homes. . "" In the following pages, I analyze "primitive" art as it is displayed in a sample of households drawn from five areas in the New York region. These areas offer, within the limits of a single study, a cross-section of social classes and neighbor- hoods. Three of the areas are middle or upper-middle class. They include the expensive town houses of Manhattan's Upper East Side (the area sampled runs from 60th to 86th streets between Second and Park avenues);12 a group of adjoining upper-middle-class suburbs-Manhasset, Pland- ome, Plandome Heights, and Flower Hill-on Long Island's North Shore'3 (for convenience I will refer to these suburbs 7For example, King has complained that: "To compartmentalize [North American] Indian art as 'traditional' or 'nontraditional' is to deny the continuity of Indian society by specifying a particular point at which it breaks from the past. To do this is to idealize precontact societies and to imply that in adopting Euro-American ideas, materials, and markets, Indian societies are absorbed." See J. King, "Tradition in Native American Art," in The Arts of the North American Indian: Natzve Tradztions in Evolution, ed. E. Wade, New York, 1986, 92. AldonaJonaitis, too, has criticized the "invention" of traditional American Indian art, writing that most museum collections that typically serve as the basis for definitions of Native American art were created between 1860 and 1930, a time of severe cultural upheaval among most Indian groups. Nevertheless, many museums-and the literature based on their collections-present art collected and in many cases actually produced during this period as "authentic and traditional" Indian art, timeless and eternal. See A. Jonaitis in J. Berlo, ed., The Early Years of Native American Art Hzstory, Seattle, 1992. Clifford is also in the vanguard of this critical movement. By contrast, some recent exhibitions of "tribal" art have made an effort to present the current artistic works as of equal value with the earlier ones. See, for instance, A. Jonaitis, ed., Chiefly Feasts: The Enduring Kwakiutl Potlatch, exh. cat., American Museum of Natural History, New York, 1991. 8 For examples of theorists of "mass culture," see B. Rosenberg and D. White, eds., Mass Culture: The Popular Arts in America, New York, 1957. For some of the original Frankfurt School formulations, see M. Horkhei- mer and T. Adorno, "The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass Deception," in Dzalectic of Enlzghtenment (1944), trans. J. Cummings, New York, 1972. Recent theorists in the same tradition are J. Baudrillard, "The System of Objects" and "The Ecstasy of Communication," in M. Poster, ed., Baudrdzlard: Selected Wrztings, Stanford, 1988; and F. Jameson, "Reification and Utopia in Mass Culture," Social Text, I, 1979, 130-148. The formulations of these theorists have of course been criticized. See, e.g., R. Bauer and A. Bauer, "America, 'Mass Society' and Mass Media," Journal of Social Issues, xvi, 3, 1960, 3-66; and H. Gans, Popular Culture and High Culture: An Analysis and Evaluation of Taste, New York, 1974. 9 L. Steinberg, "Contemporary Art and Its Public," in Other Criteria: Confrontations with Twentieth-Century Art, New York, 1972. 10 An interesting recent study looks at the way "primitive" art has been presented in literature and the popular media in the West. See S. Price, Primztzve Art in Civilized Places, Chicago, 1989. The audience, as pre- sented by Price, occupies a somewhat free-floating middle ground between, on the one hand, the artists, museums, and critics, and, on the other hand, those who purchase "tribal" art and view and display it in their homes-the topic of this article. For a discussion of Price's argument, see my conclusion here. I I S. Vogel, The Art of Collecting African Art, New York, 1988, 4-5. Compare Goldwater (p. 7): "Consideration [by the ethnographic muse- ums] of the aesthetic values of primitive art comes . .. considerably after the beginning of such an appreciation on the part of artists and private collectors." 12 In drawing the sample for this area, I focused on owner-occupied town houses, and excluded apartment buildings and brownstones that were clearly subdivided into several apartments. I did this partly for compara- bility with the other four areas sampled, where I also focused on owner-occupied houses, and partly because a researcher cannot easily get past the doorman who typically screens visitors in these large apartment buildings. For more on the research methods used, see n. 18. 13 The residents here are a mixture of Catholics and Protestants, with a small number ofJews.</page><page sequence="3">THE AUDIENCE FOR "PRIMITIVE" ART IN NEW YORK HOUSES 399 as "Manhasset"); and Spinney Hill, a middle-class black (African-American) suburb that forms a section of Great Neck, Long Island.14 The other two neighborhoods sampled are working- and lower-middle class. These include, in the city, Greenpoint, Brooklyn,'5 and, in the suburbs, Medford, Long Island.16 The neighborhoods studied, although often close to predominantly black neighborhoods, are all predom- inantly white, except for Spinney Hill, which was chosen deliberately to explore the relation between race and "tribal" art.17 Also, whereas four of the areas were chosen to be somewhat representative of their type of social class and neighborhood, the Manhattan townhouses were selected as an extreme case. Their residents are as wealthy and knowl- edgeable an audience for art as any residential group in the United States. Their occupations are of two main types-- either the upper echelons of business, which offer the economic means to purchase art, or the creative arts them- selves. The analysis is based on research in 220 houses, sixty each from the Upper East Side and Manhasset, twenty from Spinney Hill, and forty from each of the other areas. From each area I chose a random sample of houses.8" Then, with an assistant, I interviewed residents in their homes. I also took a full set of photographs of the interior of most dwellings, and drew a floor plan. Almost all the persons interviewed were homeowners, rather than renters. The discussion of "primitive" art reported here is part of a larger study which examines the full range of artistic and cultural items displayed in these houses. The research on "primitive" art took place over a three-year period, from 1989 to 1992. The sample size was appropriate for the aims of this research. Larger samples, of several hundred respondents or more, do have the advantage of enabling the use of sophisti- cated statistical techniques to capture many kinds of varia- tion. But they are inevitably limited in the amount and kind of detail they can collect. In particular, they would make it hard to examine the art that respondents actually display, a fatal defect given the research that I had in mind. It was for such reasons that I chose a sample more modest in size. I will start by sketching certain features of the sampled audience's interest in "tribal" art, and will suggest that some of these features may also characterize twentieth-century Western taste for "primitive" art. In particular, I will point to a focus on displaying images of the "tribal" person, in the form of figures, faces, and masks, as opposed to other forms of "primitive" art such as jewelry, textiles, or basketry; to a discrepancy between the reception of figures and faces on the one hand, and masks on the other; to certain differences in the attitude toward "primitive" art on the part of sections of the upper-middle class and the working class, and to a lack of clarity as to which social class's attitude is the more "authentic"; and to a focus on "tribal" art from Africa, Native America, and Oceania. I will then suggest some explanations for these findings that locate residents' attitudes and tastes as much in the context of their neighborhood and social life, and related causal forces, as in the proddings of artists, critics, and museums. The Shape of Audience Interest in "Tribal" Art Defining "Primitive" Art At the start of each interview, residents of all the areas sampled were asked if they had any "primitive" art. "Primitive" is thus a subjective term in this study. It denotes objects that people classified as such. The objects that residents mentioned fell into two main categories. The first, which I will not analyze in detail here because of its insignifi- cant size, consisted of works by Western artists-mostly 4" The large majority of residents interviewed in Spinney Hill were African-Americans born in the United States. A minority were immi- grants born in the Caribbean. 15 Greenpoint is just across the East River from Manhattan. My research here focused on two adjacent sections, one mostly Polish, the other mostly Italian. The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway roughly separates these two sections. (The entire area studied is bounded by Greenpoint Avenue to the north, Kingsland Avenue to the east, Grand Street to the south, and Manhattan Avenue and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway to the west.) The sections sampled are moderate-income areas, many of whose occupants have blue-collar or lower white-collar jobs. The residences are modest-row houses or small, free-standing homes; most are wood frame, and many were built around World War I. 16 Medford is in the unfashionable center of Long Island, just off Exit 63 of the Long Island Expressway. Most of the inhabitants are working- or lower-middle-class people. Medford was built by developers in the late fifties and sixties and was intended to be inexpensive. The builder laid out the streets in economical grid fashion, like the city, not bothering with the "winding" streets that purport to give more expensive develop- ments in the suburbs a "country" look. The original price of a house was $8,000 (not much higher than the famously inexpensive Levittown houses built a decade earlier). The Medford houses are modest in size: most are simple ranches, a few are split-level. 17 Although these neighborhoods reflect the segregation by race that marks residential life in the United States (and most other advanced industrial societies), the flavor of the segregation and the predominant reasons for it (economics, prejudice, or both) vary from area to area. The section of Greenpoint sampled is a white enclave, bordered on three sides by water (the north, west, and east); to the south the Italian section divides white Greenpoint from one of the largest black ghettos in America-Flatbush and East New York. The houses built in the first section of Medford were sold almost entirely to whites. The completion of later sections coincided with a recession in the housing market. That, and a reputation Medford acquired for having many unruly teenagers, led to an exodus of some of the earlier residents. Several of the houses were then sold or rented to blacks, so that Medford now contains a minority of black residents, concentrated toward the periphery of the area sampled. The upper-middle-class suburbs of Manhasset contain almost no blacks. Middle-class blacks reside in, for example, nearby Spinney Hill. 18 The sample was drawn from a list, prepared by touring each area, of all the houses in each area. In preparing the list I excluded apartment buildings, and houses whose mailboxes indicated they were subdivided into several apartments. I sent a letter to each house selected, explaining the research. A few days later, my research assistant and I visited people's homes. When people answered the door, we purposely avoided asking for an interview at once, since to do so gave people too little time to decide if we were the kind of strangers they could safely allow into their homes. Instead, we talked in a general way about the study. This was important, for it gave people time to assess us and gave us a chance to kindle their interest in the topic. I went with a female assistant because this was, for some residents, more reassuring than a man alone. The response rate was surprisingly high for such a study. Not counting the Italian section of Greenpoint or the black section of Spinney Hill, we obtained interviews in 62% of the houses selected for study. In the Italian section of Greenpoint the response rate was 40% and in Spinney Hill it was 47%. The overall response rates for each area sampled are as follows: Medford-68%; Manhasset-67%; Greenpoint-60% Manhat- tan-53%.</page><page sequence="4">400 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1993 VOLUME LXXV NUMBER 3 TABLE 1.

The second category of items mentioned consisted of objects from non-Western societies, especially Africa, Oce- ania, and Native America (see Table 1). Eighty-three percent of the items mentioned fell into this category. African art dominated here, being present in 76% of the houses with "primitive" (non-Western) art, and constituting 72% of all the items of "primitive" (non-Western) art displayed.19 The next most common category was Native American art. Notice, within the category of Native American art, the disproportionately large presence of Pre-Columbian art as contrasted with North American Indian or Eskimo (Inuit) art. Thus of the houses with "primitive" art, 29% contained a Pre-Columbian piece, but only 10% contained any North American Indian item and only 3% anything Eskimo. Aside from this point about the composition of the Native American items, the general pattern in the houses sampled corresponds to the main use of the term "primitive" art in twentieth-century artistic and cultural circles. By the 1920s in the West, "primitive" art had come to refer primarily to "tribal" objects from three regions-Africa, Oceania, and Native America-with African art predominating. Yet Suzanne Blier has pointed out that there are often closer ties between African and European art traditions than between African art and either Oceanic or Native American art. Hence the association of African, Native American, and Oceanic art is problematic. The art of these three regions does not have enough in common intrinsically to justify the grouping together, and it is as yet unclear why, in the modern West, they have been linked together as producers of "primitive" art.20 Masks and the Role of Social Class. "Primitive" art is fairly popular among the upper-middle and middle classes. Fifty-eight percent of the houses on the 19 Despite the widespread dissatisfaction in art circles nowadays with the term "primitive" art (mentioned in n. 2), only one resident balked at using the term. 20 She writes: "The linking of African, Oceanic, and Native American art ... represents little more than imaginative musings."

The term "primitive" was not, of course, always used in this way in art. On the history of the use of the term, see Rubin and Blier.

East Side of Manhattan, 40% of the houses in Spinney Hill, and 22% of those in Manhasset had items of "primitive" art (see Table 2). It is of negligible interest to the white working class. Only one house in Greenpoint and one in Medford had any at all. The attitude of almost all of the working class toward "primitive" art fell into two categories-either dis- taste or indifference. The following comments, from working- class people asked if they had any "primitive" art, exemplify distaste, with especially negative reactions to masks. A man in his late thirties: "African statues and masks give me the heebie-jeebies. They make me think of things I don't want to think of, like Amityville." A woman in her late forties: "Those masks are creepy, they're scary!" Although it may be tempting to dismiss such attitudes as examples of the incompetence of the working class in the realm of aesthetics, this would be too simple. In fact, several anthropological studies of "tribal" masks and figures in their societies of origin suggest that the native attitude also often varies from fear, in the ceremonial context, to a kind of indifference otherwise.21 The objects, especially the masks, are indeed often intended specifically to frighten the specta- tors, and fear predominates when the objects are endowed by ritual with special qualities. Indifference, on the other hand, predominates outside the ceremonial context. For example, in many societies most of the sculptures and masks are out of sight and inaccessible much of the time. These remarks, of course, apply only to masks, figures, and faces, not to such genres as jewelry, basketry, and clothing. For example, in a classic study of art among the Kalabari in West Africa, Robin Horton found repulsion or indifference to be the dominant native attitude toward the sculpture. Most of the sculptures and masks were kept stored away in ill-lighted shrines which most people could not enter, and were only taken out when the rituals were performed. Even when in use, they might not be seen by the spectators, for many of the masks were worn on top of the dancer's head, facing the sky, directed toward the spirits. Thus these masks, supposedly admired in the West for their aesthetic qualities, were not even intended for human gaze in their societies of origin. I do not want to suggest that the attitude of the American working class to these objects is particularly close to that of the people in the societies that produced them, for there are clearly huge differences between the two cultures. I just want to note that the question of which social class in America has the more appropriate attitude is not easy to answer.22 Moreover, aesthetic distaste for the masks is also common among the upper-middle-class residents sampled, even among residents who themselves display masks. Just over half the residents who displayed masks in their houses also perceived them as ugly. A Manhattan architect had only one "primitive" piece in his house-a large mask, which he thought was "ugly," that dominated the dining room. An Upper East Side woman commented, when asked about an Indonesian mask she had prominently displayed in front of the living room fireplace: "What can one say? There is something ugly about it. It's not pretty, it's a little frighten- ing, it's evil, like the devil." "Then why do you display it?" "I really don't know." Although a Manhasset woman's house was full of African figures, she insisted that her husband keep the masks in his office. "My husband would have masks all over the house, but I don't like them. I don't like them look- ing at us." A Manhattan woman had in the past displayed two huge Sri Lankan masks in her dining room, one of which had "snakes coming out of its ears and people hanging from its mouth." The masks used to "bother people sitting opposite them at the table"; they also "bothered the little kids. My daughter's friends were afraid to walk through to get to the kitchen." For the latter reason, she and her husband finally put the masks in storage, but she said, "even though they may be ugly, I find them attractive in a different sense." These comments suggest a so-far-unnoticed point about "primitive" masks. The masks-at least those that diverged 21 An expert on Maori art writes: "Many Maori individuals are afraid of 'taonga' (ritual objects including masks and figures) and will not have them near their food or lying by their beds. Some tremble in the presence of such 'taonga,' while others stand in awe or weep." See S.M. Mead, in S. Mead, ed., Te Maorz. Maorz Artfrom New Zealand Collectzons, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, 1984, 23. Frank Willett writes that, "[African] masks are usually occupied by the spirit only during the ceremonies; between times they are regarded as so much wood." See Willett, 168 and 174. For a protest that Western stress on the "fearful" aspects of (undifferentiated) "tribal" objects reflects Western biases and even racism, see Price, 37-55. 22 See R.

When, for example, Alain Locke reviewed a collection from the Belgium Congo in 1927, he extolled the visual qualities of many types of artifacts-figures, faces, jewelry, musical instruments, weapons-but drew the line at the masks, which he described as "bizarre and grotesque." Locke's dislike of the masks is the more striking because he was perhaps the leading black advocate in the United States of the aesthetic virtues of African art. A central philosopher of the Harlem Renaissance, he articulated an aesthetic theory that called for black artists to acknowledge their African heritage.23 The landmark 1935 MoMA exhibition "African Negro Art" did include masks, but in the catalogue James Sweeney, the curator, wondered whether the masks deserved as high a ranking as the figures.24 Pioneer artists such as Picasso were, it is true, enthusiastic about masks from the start. Nevertheless, many of the kinds of masks that first interested them seem to have been those most closely resembling figure sculpture. For instance the Fang mask that Vlaminck acquired in 1906 and that later became so famous that one authority described it as "the principal tribal icon of twentieth century primitivism," is basically a carved face (Fig. 1).25 It is, in fact, hard to be entirely sure what proportion of the masks that the pioneer artists first collected were basically carved faces and what proportion diverged into more fantastic forms. An exhibi- tion by the Muse6 de l'Homme that aimed to recreate the "primitive" art collections of each of these artists did not, unfortunately, distinguish items collected early, in the first two decades of the twentieth century, from those collected later, when fantastic masks had become more popular in cultural circles.26 Still, from inspection of photographs of the "primitive" art in artists' studios and homes in the first two decades, it appears that masks as carved faces predominate. Certainly the well-known collections of "fantastic" masks- that is, those most unlike a human face, often because they depict animals and fantastic beasts (Fig. 2)-were made somewhat later, in particular when Oceanic art became popular with the Surrealists. A notable example here is Max Ernst's collection. Among residents sampled in this study, it is the patterned response that masks are ugly that is so striking. An entire category of art-"primitive" masks-is seen as unattractive yet is still displayed. From time to time, residents would 1 Fang Mask, Gabon, painted wood. Paris, Mus&amp;e National d'Art Moderne, Centre National d'Art et de Culture Georges Pompidou express dislike of another (non-mask) artistic item in their house, but such comments were not, as in the case of masks, concentrated on a specific genre.27 In any event, such cases were unusual for, apart from "primitive" masks, if one spouse disliked an item, its chances of being displayed were usually doomed. Among residents willing to display masks that they find ugly, the attraction appears to depend on the objects' nonaesthetic, rather than aesthetic, qualities. This finding underscores the need to seek out the symbolic meaning that the objects must possess. The Focus on the Person Masks are, of course, not the only type of "primitive" art displayed. But it is depictions of the persona-notjust masks but also figures and heads-that predominate. There are a total of 178 items that refer to the human person. Only twenty-four items do not (see Table 3); these latter include musical instruments, weapons, ornaments, baskets and tools, textiles and hieroglyphics.28 Figures 3-6 give the flavor of 23 Locke also wondered how a people capable of producing such beauty in other areas could lapse into "grotesque starkness and crudity" in their masks.

On Locke's importance as a spokesman for black American artists, see Harlem Renaissance: Art of Black America, exh. cat., Studio Museum in Harlem, New York, 1987, 38ff. The Steiglitz exhibition in 1914 presented African statuary as art, but seems to have included no masks. On the content of this exhibition, see the review by Charles Caffin, the noted art critic, in New York American, repr. in Camera Work, XLVIII, 1916, and available in J.

Although he has about twenty masks, figures, and faces in his collection, there are about twice as many other items-weapons, fabric, musical instruments, ornaments. The composition of the items in this household in many ways resembles an ethnographic museum, which is not surprising since the main intent of the priest who collected them was to record the progress of the people he studied toward Christianity.</page><page sequence="7">THE AUDIENCE FOR "PRIMITIVE" ART IN NEW YORK HOUSES 403 2 Bird Head Dress, Baga, New Guinea.

In fact, only 34% of the houses with "primitive" art have pieces that experts had judged to be of quality. Yet in the cases of these "quality" pieces, the focus on the person is also clear, for all except two are masks, figures, or heads.29 The nonquality pieces in the houses are mostly mass- produced for the tourist trade-"airport art," as experts have dismissively referred to such pieces.30 TABLE 3.

This study's findings mirror the selective appreciation with which twentieth-century Westerners have met "primitive" art. Despite all the talk about the recognition, in this century, of the aesthetic merits of such art, it is primarily depictions of the "primitive" persona-figures, faces, and masks-that have excited the interest of artists, museums, and the public. The focus on African sculpture is, for example, well known for such artists as Picasso and Vlaminck. Further underlining the centrality for these vanguard artists of the subject matter, rather than aesthetic merit, is the fact that the masks and figures that so captivated them were, art experts agree, far from the finest examples. Putting the matter beyond doubt, Picasso, when asked about the mediocre quality of the pieces in his collection, replied: "You don't need the masterpiece to get the idea."31 The same focus on the "primitive" person is widespread among museums and the public, as much evidence suggests. 29 "Quality pieces" here are defined as those which residents said had been professionally appraised as valuable. The two "quality" pieces that did not refer to the person were Pre-Columbian pots. 30 By 1968, a specialist on African art could write: "On a vast scale in many parts of Africa, but especially in East Africa, mechanized factories are springing up .... The object is designed specifically for a popular trade dominated by the requirements of vulgarization"; F. McEwen, "Return to Origins: New Directions for African Arts." African Arts, I, 2, Spring, 1968, 18-25 and 88. Recently some researchers have started to take "tourist" art seriously for what it tells us about cultural practices, if not for its aesthetic merits. See, e.g., N. Graburn, ed., Ethnic and Tourist Arts, Berkeley, 1976, and R. Phillips, "Glimpses of Eden," European Review of Native American Studies, v, 1991, 19-28. 31 Picasso not only did not care about the aesthetic quality of the figures and masks that he saw. He also did not care about understanding their meaning in their societies of origin. As he said: "Everything I need to know about Africa is in these objects." All this underlines the fact that it was the subject matter-the treatment of the person-that attracted Picasso. See Rubin, 1-11. On the mediocre aesthetic quality of most of the works that Picasso and his circle first observed, see also J. Laude, "Lectures des arts 'primitifs,' " in Arts primitifs (as in n. 26) and Willett, 36.</page><page sequence="8">404 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1993 VOLUME LXXV NUMBER 3 i?~?: i. ;" .:~lb: ??~ ?;1~!5'~i :? ?: . .h;? ~ :, "1? ci~ '. ? ??? ;?.i. ? ? ? ~; ?

Susan Vogel, the organizer of the experiment, commented: "I put into the pool of photos a number of fine nonfigurative items such as textiles, vessels, a hammock, and other artifacts. On the whole they excited little interest. Only one object completely lacking in representational features was chosen."32 Western museums do, from time to time, mount exhibitions of other types of African art, for instance, jewelry, textiles, pottery, and basketry. But these exhibitions tend to have a defensive quality, underlining the fact that the bulk of public and expert interest lies in the sculpture. For example, in 1972 the Museum of Modern Art presented an exhibition of African textiles and decorative arts, especially jewelry and costumes. Roy Sieber, who organized the exhibi- tion, began the catalogue tartly: Together this essay and its illustrations constitute an introduction to the rich and varied world of African textiles and decorative arts, particularly costumes and jewelry. The study of these traditional forms has been neglected by the West, where attention has been focused primarily on the sculpture of Africa. This attitude not only stems from Western aesthetic values but results in a geo- graphical emphasis on West Africa where most traditional sculpture is to be found. However, the richness of inven- tion and variety in the arts of personal adornment is pan- African and may, indeed, reveal the breadth and range of the aesthetic life of traditional Africa with greater accuracy than the limited formulations that currently serve in the West as a basis for most studies in African art.33 I am of course discussing a tendency, albeit pronounced, to favor depictions of the "primitive" persona. Apart from Sieber, there are numerous individual exceptions, especially among scholars. Thus one of the most important early twentieth-century statements about "primitive" art was Franz Boas's Primitive Art. Boas paid a great deal of attention to nonfigurative artworks, and praised their artistic qualities.34 It is depictions of the person that continue to arouse so much enthusiasm among artists, experts, and the public. Consider, for example, the recent exhibition by Gene Bor- gatti and Richard Brilliant, "Likeness and Beyond: Portraits 32J.

For example, in 1702 the Dutchman Van Nyendael visited the Benin and was struck by the "very well carved" copper snakes, by the "beautifully chequered" cloths, and by such personal ornaments as coral necklaces and copper arm rings. He dismissed the numerous masks and figures as "wretched- ly carved." The Scottish surgeon Mungo Park, who traveled through West Africa in 1795-97, commented on the blue dyed cloth among the Mandingoes ("equal to the best Indian or European blue"), on their gold personal ornaments, and on the "very beautiful baskets, hats, and other articles" found in Bambarra and Kaarta. He said nothing complimentary about the sculpture. Neither, about twenty years later, did Bowdich, the British envoy to the Ashanti; instead he praised their dyed cloth, commenting on its "fineness, variety, brilliance, and size," and he also considered they "excelled in pottery, especially clay pipes.""37 The findings from the households sampled thus raise more general questions about the shape of twentieth-century Western interest in "tribal" art. There is a need to account for the focus on depictions of the "primitive" persona-in the form of figures, faces, and masks-especially since this occurred at a time when Western interest in depictions of contemporary Western persons-the portrait-was in de- cline. There is a need to account for the willingness to display fantastic and even "grotesque" or "ugly" masks. And there is a need to account for the association of African, Oceanic, and Native American artifacts as "primitive" art, with African art predominant. The theory that "primitive" art in the modern American house has a political dimension suggests an expla- nation for some of this. The Political Dimension Displaying "primitive" art may be a political act, for it is highly correlated with political party affiliation. Table 4 shows that, with respect to attitudes toward "primitive" art, there is a marked difference between two types of residents who display "tribal" art. One group places the art in a position of honor, and views it as coequal to the best of Western art. Among such residents, 66% were registered Democrats, and 29% were unregistered. Only 5% (two households) were registered Republicans.38 A second group, much smaller in number, views the artworks either with derision or in Darwinian terms as precursors of forms later "perfected" in the West. Persons in this group are either registered Republicans or are unregistered. None are regis- tered Democrats. It is not hard to explain why the respectful display of images of "primitive" persons-at least those from Africa, the predominant type-should be highly correlated with Democratic politics. The art of Africans is associated in the United States with the cultural tradition of American blacks- African-Americans; to respect African art is to respect, one or two steps removed, African-Americans. Further, to introduce an image of a black into a white house and neighborhood is to violate, albeit symbolically and privately, the racial segre- gation that pervades American neighborhoods. Almost every- one in the city or suburbs knows if their own, and nearby, neighborhoods are "white," "black," or, in unusual cases, 36 See, e.g., Willett, passim. 37 See D. Van Nyendael, letter written Sept. 1, 1702, repr. in W. Bosman, A New and Accurate Description of the Coast of Guinea, London, 1966, 440, 463-464; M. Park, Travels in the Interior Districts ofAfrica, London, 1799, 285-286; T. Bowdich, Mission from Cape Coast Castle to Ashantee (London, 1819), repr. London, 1966. 38 Two households had "primitive" art and treated it with respect, yet were Republican in their political orientation, but one of these was only partly an exception to the tendency of persons owning and respecting "primitive" art to be Democrats. Thus the wife in this household had one item of "primitive" art, a face from South Africa that her niece (a famous designer) had given her as a gift. Although the wife liked this particular item, and believed it to be equal to some of the best of Western art, she hated "primitive" art in general, believing it to be inferior in quality, and to. be produced by cultures that were alien to her own (that of the "WASPs," as she put it).</page><page sequence="11">THE AUDIENCE FOR "PRIMITIVE" ART IN NEW YORK HOUSES 407 TABLE 4.

Note that if one spouse made a derogatory comment about the art, it is assumed here that the other spouse's attitude is also derogatory. racially mixed.39 To display an image of a black African in a place of honor in a modern American house could scarcely be an innocent or accidental act. Now, in the field of modern American politics, the Democratic party is firmly viewed as the party associated with African-Americans. Indeed, of the various groups (the South, the poor, blue-collar workers, Catholics and Jews, blacks) that once constituted the famous electoral coalition that coalesced around Franklin Roosevelt and the Democratic party, nowadays only blacks remain as committed Democratic party voters.40 It is, therefore, under- standable that those who pay respect to "primitive," espe- cially African, art, should also be Democratic in their poli- tics.41 On the other hand, a minority of residents who display "primitive" artifacts deride them, or perceive them as infe- rior versions of forms later fully realized in the West. These residents are either Republicans or non-voters; none are Democrats (Table 4). Consider the following in detail. Four of the households view their artifacts with derision. For example, a Manhasset woman has an African mask in her bathroom ". .. as a joke. Sometimes it scares people, and then we have a good laugh." An East Side woman who has a Polynesian face on her kitchen wall comments that it is "bizarre having a cannibal in the kitchen!" (Fig. 7). In addition to these households where "tribal" persons are ridiculed, three other households dis- play items in a way that, while not intended as derogatory, presents "tribal" societies from an evolutionary perspective. The residents here see the objects as inferior versions of forms later improved upon by Western society. A priest in Manhattan who directs the U.S. Catholic missionary effort abroad views "primitive" artifacts as precursors of Christian- ity. He comments: "When I look at these I feel I'm at the pre-faith experience. Like they do have a concept of an after-life. You can trace the development of the church from these kinds of beliefs." His collection is arranged accordingly to record the progress toward Christianity of the peoples he studies (Fig. 8). The "tribal" artifacts hang on the wall that leads from the third floor to his fourth-floor apartment; his apartment above is full of the symbols of Christianity-the entire layout a metaphor for the ascent of mankind from pagan to Christian beliefs. "Primitive" figures can thus also be symbols of a right-wing attitude, echoing and perhaps updating a long tradition of using material objects-salt and pepper shakers, cookie jars, ashtrays, etc.-that depict black people in a degrading and stereotyped manner as subservient, powerless, and often with grossly caricatured features.42 In the United States, Aunt Jemima is the best known character depicted in such objects. This political dimension goes some way toward explaining why African art-and, in particular, images of the persona- dominates residents' displays of "tribal" artifacts. African art is clearly an appropriate symbol for the expression of 39 For demographic studies that document the degree of separation between whites and blacks in the United States, and its even greater pervasiveness in the suburbs than in the cities, see R. Farley, "The Changing Distribution of Negroes within Metropolitan Areas: The Emergence of Black Suburbs," Amerzcan Journal of Sociology, Lxxv, 1970, 512-529, and idem, "Residential Segregation in Urbanized Areas of the United States in 1970: An Analysis of Social Class and Racial Differences," Demography, xiv, November, 1977, 497-518; M. White, "Segregation and Diversity Measures in Population Distribution," Population Index, LII, Summer, 1986, 198-221. White argues that segregation declined somewhat in the 1970s, but still remained high. 40 See P. Abramson, J. Aldrich, and D. Rohde, Change and Continuity in the 1988 Elections, Washington, D.C., 1990, 122. Abramson et al. suggest that the firm association, in the electorate's mind, of the Democratic party with blacks was perhaps the most important reason why other groups who had once been part of F.D.R.'s coalition were increasingly reluctant to vote for Democratic presidential candidates in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1992, it took the perception that Bush was incompetent in the area of economic policy for these other groups to move away from the Republican presidential candidate. Still, in 1992 too African- Americans voted Democratic in far greater proportions than any other social group. 41 Nelson Rockefeller, who did as much as anyone to place "primitive" art on an equal aesthetic standing with Western art, may be the "exception that proves the rule." For Rockefeller led the liberal wing of the Republican party, and the "liberal-Republican" category to which he belonged scarcely exists anymore. The policies associated with it have proven too radical for the Republican Party and have been willingly ceded to the Democrats. 42 On these figurines, see S. Dubin, "Symbolic Slavery: Black Represen- tations in Popular Culture," Social Problems, xxxiv, 1987, 122-139.</page><page sequence="12">408 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1993 VOLUME LXXV NUMBER 3 ''W V.

Ownership of "primitive" art, in this context, as in Europe in the early decades of this century, is at least partly about attitudes toward blacks. James Clifford, who recently criti- cized conventional explanations for the attraction of "primi- tive" art that focus on the aesthetic taste of certain artists and writers in Paris in the 1900s, makes the European case clear. Picasso, Apollinaire, and the others "discovered" "primitive" art in the context of a period of growing "n6grophilie" in Paris and elsewhere in Europe. This included the recogni- tion of a variety of evocative black figures-the jazzman, the boxer (Al Brown), and the "sauvage" Josephine Baker. Enthusiasm for African art was thus linked to racial percep- tions of blacks, who, in Europe, were prized for their purported vitality, rhythm, and erotic and magical power.43 The Social Dimension Black Households There is clearly much left unexplained, as suggested by the data from the black households sampled. Responses by residents of the middle-class African-American households in Spinney Hill do not at first sight differ markedly from those of white households when asked about "primitive" art. The main difference is that African-American households are likely to see some ancestral connection, however distant, between the "tribal" art and their own culture. In the African-American households, however, it makes no sense to study "primitive" art apart from certain other depictions. "Tribal" blacks ("primitive" art) are only a fraction of the depictions of blacks displayed in these houses (see Table 5). For example, classical religious pictures in which black figures substitute for whites are displayed in sixty percent of the houses. An example is The Last Supper, with Jesus and the disciples as black. Also, some households have depictions of black political leaders (Martin Luther King accounts for many of these cases) or of black entertainers. In addition, some households have paintings of blacks in everyday, usually American, scenes, for example in church or playing music. Finally, family photographs are displayed in every house studied. In the black households studied, depictions of "tribal" blacks ("primitive" art) form the extreme end of a continuum that can be constructed based on the "distance" of the blacks depicted from residents' own lives and experiences. This continuum runs from tribal blacks and classical religious figures portrayed as blacks, the most distant from residents' own lives, through American black political leaders and 43 Clifford, 196ff.</page><page sequence="13">THE AUDIENCE FOR "PRIMITIVE" ART IN NEW YORK HOUSES 409 8 Stairway from third to fourth floor in a Manhattan rectory (photo: Martha Cooper) entertainers, paintings of blacks in everyday American scenes, and finally to photographs of residents' own families. It is striking that the white households with "primitive" art almost always choose to display only those blacks who are most distant from residents' lives and from the experiences of actual African-Americans.44 This suggests another dimen- sion of the appeal of "tribal" persons as images for display. In white households, the simultaneous presence of images of "tribal" persons and the near absence of images of contempo- rary African-Americans symbolizes a truth about the actual exclusion of the latter in modern American life. The racial separation that pervades modern American life, especially in the residential sphere, is thus reflected in this decision to display "tribal" persons but not African-Americans. It is significant that the taste for displaying images of "tribal" Africans as art took root among the American upper-middle class on the East Coast in the 1920s, thirties, and forties, the period when blacks from the South started to TABLE 5.

This was, as well, the time when blacks began to replace the Irish as the main category of live-in and non-live-in servants in Northern cities.45 The period also saw the "Harlem Renaissance," when black artists explicitly aimed to produce "black" art, and engaged in cultural activities at least some of which were well known to, and attended by, many culturally avant-garde whites.46 For example, the white Harmon Foundation funded the main artistic institution of the Harlem Renaisance, an annual juried exhibition, first held in 1926, featuring paint- ing and sculpture by black artists. Thus for politically liberal Northern whites, this series of events were probably important factors in the decision to accept "tribal" African artifacts as art. Displaying such artifacts would have been, and continues to be, a gesture toward the ancestral culture of these now more numerous and more culturally assertive black residents of the region, and adjuncts to the household. On the other hand, for politically conservative Northern whites, the decision to display the same images, by drawing attention to the "primitive" and uncivilized origins of American blacks, perhaps suggested the basic incompatibility of the latter with contemporary white American neighborhoods and with the white nuclear family. In both cases, the display of images of "primitive," but not modern, American blacks symbolized the pervasive segregation of American society. Recall, for example, that the famous Cotton Club in Harlem excluded blacks from the audience, members of whom had to pass an explicit skin-color test to show that they were white enough to be admitted. 44 Three white households are exceptions; they display, respectively, a picture of Martin Luther King, a photograph of a black maid, and a contemporary photograph of a Harlem street scene. 45 On African-Americans in domestic service in Northern cities in the 20th century, see D. Katzman, Seven Days a Week, New York, 1978. 46 See, e.g., Harlem Renaissance: Art of Black America (as in n. 23).</page><page sequence="14">410 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1993 VOLUME LXXV NUMBER 3 This suggests the mono-causality of the traditional view that avant-garde whites in New York in the 1920s and thirties came to accept African artifacts as art because they were influenced by the New York art 1lite, who were in turn influenced by Parisian artists who had "discovered" African art. This view surely contains an important part of the truth, but also to link the new white taste for African art to the Harlem Renaissance and to contemporary demographic movements of blacks into the region is just as plausible. What of the taste for displaying Pre-Columbian figures, which developed among collectors somewhat later than did the taste for African art? Much of the preceding analysis is also likely to apply to this question. Collecting Pre- Columbian art began to become voguish among the avant- garde in New York from about 1950 on, which coincided with the start of the period in which Puerto Rican migration to the East Coast, and to New York City in particular, exploded, followed later by sizeable migrations from other Latin American countries. Further, many of these Hispanic immigrants have also been excluded from white neighbor- hoods, though less rigidly so than African-Americans, yet they are present as domestic servants. Thus for white residents who are liberals, images of Pre-Columbians are a symbolic recognition of the cultures of these newly important immigrant groups. For example, an Upper East Side psycho- analyst has a Pre-Columbian figure on his desk; a convinced Democrat, he believes that the Puerto Rican presence in the city brings us "a consciousness that we would not otherwise have, a vigor, a stress on the human dimension rather than just bricks and mortar." By contrast, for conservative resi- dents, the same kinds of Pre-Columbian figures can under- line the nonwhite, non-European origins of many persons from the regions associated with this type of art. For example, a Republican couple on the Upper East Side has a Pre-Columbian whistle, shaped like a man, in their living room (Fig. 9). Twenty years ago the husband had failed in a bid for election to political office in New York, and he still ruefully attributes the defeat to his Democratic opponent's strong showing among the "Puerto Ricans who live above Ninety-sixth street." It may be no accident that his wife liked the man-whistle because what she described as the feathers on the man's head reminded her of exotic birds. Further, although Democrats and Republicans often have different political and social attitudes toward the large Hispanic presence in the region, for both groups the display in their homes of ancestral, Pre-Columbian images and the absence of images of contemporary Hispanics may symbolize the separations between Hispanics and whites that continue to mark North American neighborhoods. Surely the striking scarcity of depictions of North Ameri- can Indians or of Eskimos in the houses studied (see Table 1) is due to the dearth of such groups as a physical presence or as a socio-political issue in the New York region. Few residents sampled have any contacts with North American Indians or Eskimos, in contrast with routine encounters with blacks and Hispanics both outside the home and within, often as domestic help. There is no need to point out that in regions with larger populations of North American Indians, the arts of the latter .1: I~~ b~elll~8B88s ..........~i 2"' IR, pow ~ 9 Front living room of a Manhattan house, Pre-Columbian man-whistle (photo: Martha Cooper) are more likely to be displayed in the homes of upper-middle- class residents. What has not been pointed out, or at least has not been paid the attention it deserves, is that these arts, when displayed by residents of such regions, are likely to resonate with symbolic meanings that express residents' feelings toward these "native" peoples as they are actually present in the area.47 A partial explanation for the attraction of masks may also be found here. Masks dramatize, to the point of depicting ugliness, the differences between "tribal" persons and mod- ern Americans. They may also blur, to the casual eye, the question of which "tribal" peoples are associated with the mask. They thus tend to symbolize the general category of non-Western persons. At the same time, the "frightfulness" of many of these masks also appeals to a range of political attitudes. For conservatives, it can underline the "uncivilized" nature of the peoples and validate the exclusion of their modern representatives. For liberals, it can express a toler- ance that is central to liberalism, by honoring cultures that 47 Thomas Dunk writes about the prevalence of disparaging attitudes toward the Indian population among the white working class in Northwestern Ontario. See T. Dunk, It's a Working Man's Town: Male, Working-Class Culture in Northwestern Ontario, Toronto, 1991. Here the "Indians" are clearly the repository of many of the negative sentiments that, in the New York region, are ascribed by some people to African- Americans and Hispanics. It is reasonable to suppose, first, that residents of Northwestern Ontario who display "primitive" art are likely to display far more Indian art than the New York residents sampled in this study; and, second, that displaying Indian art with an attitude of respect is, in Northwestern Ontario, correlated with a liberal social and political outlook.</page><page sequence="15">THE AUDIENCE FOR "PRIMITIVE" ART IN NEW YORK HOUSES 411 are seen as strikingly different from that of the West. Thus one East Side resident liked the mask he displayed from New Caledonia because, "You can see they're more adventurous than we are-the colors, the shapes, the ideas of spirit ancestors."48 Another East Side resident liked her two Afri- can masks, and one from New Zealand, because they re- minded her of "societies without all this technology that we live with here, stereos, televisions, VCR's."'49 Another dimension of these artifacts should be noticed. The display of images of "tribal" people who are so unlike the artifacts' owners, the nuclear family, occurs in the context of a family life that is, in fact, increasingly private and exclusive and prone to define all but a few as "outsiders." Thus as regards the composition of the modern household, nowadays most upper-middle-class residents, as well as the working class, definitely prefer their residential unit to consist of the nuclear family and no one else. Other aspects of the art and visual representations that residents display-- for instance, portraits, family photographs, landscapes, and religious iconography-are marked by a clear sense of the predominance of the nuclear family, as I have argued elsewhere.50 Thus the depiction of "tribal" persons who so obviously violate the dominant modern orientation needs to be scrutinized. One interpretation is that the extreme toler- ance concerning who will be present in the home that is symbolized by these images of "tribal" people camouflages an extreme intolerance concerning these matters in fact. There may also be a sexual dimension, albeit a minor one, at play in the tribal objects displayed. Nudity, for one thing, is a dominant mode in the presentation of "tribal" figures. By contrast, human nudity is rare in the other visual imagery displayed in the houses studied. There is an occasional painting of a Western woman with breasts, but rarely with genitals, uncovered (Fig. 10). There is an occasional plaster cast of a naked woman. But these cases are few. Usually residents do not comment on the nudity of the "tribal" figures displayed in their homes, which means that their erotic symbolism can only be inferred. An unusual case, in which the owner vocalized the erotic symbolism, is that of a figure of a Bali man-animal in the living room of a Manhat- tan house. The figure's penis is erect, as the owner was eager to point out (Fig. 11). And in the master bedroom, underlin- ing this resident's interest in erotic imagery, is a lifesize plaster cast of a naked Western female. Notice also the clear connection with Western erotic imagery in the dining room of the Perls family's home, where part of their famous collection of "primitive" art is displayed (Fig. 12). The nudity of "tribal" figures can also validate both a liberal and a conservative political and social attitude. For conservatives, the nakedness of the images underlines the uncivilized nature of their peoples. For liberals, it represents part of a movement to embrace the different, the exotic, and the sexually uninhibited. In the eyes of the Surrealists, "primitive" art, especially the art of Oceania, was above all erotic. It was a visual reflection of the eros or the life drive of "primitive" man, whose sexually liberated culture did not, unlike that of the West, inhibit and repress this drive. Further, Africans in Western culture have long evoked sexually charged stereotypes. There is, too, a tradition in Western anthropology that has viewed the sexually less inhibited practices of certain tribal societies as offering a marked contrast to Western societies.51 Still, it would be a mistake to see eroticism as the para- mount meaning of the "tribal" artifacts in this study, though it may well be a motif. For one thing, only the figures display genitals or female breasts; masks and faces do not. Further, though the primitive figures may be naked, few are in explicitly sexual poses. The Bali figure referred to above is one of the few instances. By contrast, Asian Indian art, which no residents classified as "primitive," more clearly fulfills an erotic function. Residents of several East Side houses have Indian figures, intertwined in sexual poses, and they often explicitly referred to an erotic meaning for these artifacts. It is likely, however, that the erotic symbolism of "primitive" art was more important in Western households in the past, at a time when such alternate modern sources of erotic symbol- ism as books, magazines, pornographic television stations, and home videos were absent. A Case Study "Primitive" art, then, in the white Western households sampled has various discernible modes of significance-on political and social levels-all of which relate to contempo- rary Western society. These modes surely intersect with each other, and with the particular circumstances of individual residents, in various complex ways that no single study could cover, still less a study that lacks psychoanalytic data to complement the sociological findings. The following case study illustrates some of the particular meanings that can derive from this symbolic matrix. The suburban Manhasset household (Fig. 3) that contains the largest number of images of "primitive" persons-all African-is markedly to the political left, and the husband had been investigated by the United States Senate during the 48 For liberals and conservatives, masks may also, as Meyer Schapiro suggested over fifty years ago, symbolize the exotic to those aware of the mundane quality of much modern residential life. See M. Schapiro, "Abstract Art," in Modern Art, L, New York, 1978, 200-201. 49 The Surrealist claim that these masks, in their societies of origin, expressed the fantastic unconscious of "primitive" peoples, suggests an alternative explanation for their attraction in the West. This explanation implies that the Western audience likes the masks because it enjoys looking at the liberated unconscious of another people. This explana- tion excessively intellectualizes the relation between art and the viewer, which is ironic given the Surrealists' philosophical insistence on the priority of the unconscious in social life. Why should people wish to gaze at the unconscious of "primitives"? In any case, Surrealist art is, in fact, not at all popular in the upper-middle-class houses sampled, and far less so than "primitive" art. 50o See D.

This household had once contained, but eventually ejected, an African-American as a resident. He was a handyman, who had for a long time lived in the household of the parents of the wife. When her parents died, their daughter invited the handyman, who had no close relatives in the region, to come and live in the household, where he stayed for fifteen years. However, when he devel- oped Alzheimer's disease, it was decided that he could not stay, so he was sent to live with a distant relative of his. It is plausible to see condensed, in this politically and socially liberal household's displays of images of tribal Africans, the complex feelings associated not only with the housing and eventual eviction of the workman, but also with black residence in an all-white suburb and in a society in which the issue of race is rarely absent from national politics. Conclusion In migrating from the societies that produce "tribal" objects to the Western households that display them, these artifacts have acquired new symbolic meanings. These meanings relate, in a complex way, to the modern Western context. But they are by no means exclusively given by the cultural elites-museum directors, artists, critics, and so on. They derive also from the interaction between residents in the contexts of their homes and neighborhoods. Further, these new meanings arguably themselves affect the elite artistic and cultural scene via the demand, by sections of the well-to-do, for certain kinds of "primitive" art and via the interest, on the part of museum-goers, in certain kinds of exhibitions. The findings presented here thus suggest, for the case of "primitive" art, the limitations of the approach, implicit in much sociology and art history, that sees the audience as of minor importance in the construction of meanings, or that tries to "patrol" these meanings. An example of the latter approach is Sally Price's book of 1989, the main thrust of which is to complain about the discrepancy between the way Western audiences see "primitive" art and the way it is perceived in its societies of origin, and to criticize Western audiences for thus "misunderstanding" the art/artifacts.52 Yet as "tribal" art becomes recontextualized in the West, such discrepancies are inevitable, and though it is important to point them out, it is just as important to study them, and treat as "legitimate" in their own terms the new meanings that Western audiences attribute to the works. Here the audience for "tribal" art is no different from any other artistic 52 See Price (as in n. 10).</page><page sequence="17">THE AUDIENCE FOR "PRIMITIVE" ART IN NEW YORK HOUSES 413 ?? 1W-- 119i aaP. ,PA, ?7 A 31, ?if hY 5 +:? ?, 11 Manhattan living room, Bali man-animal (photo: Martha Cooper) genre. For example, there is no reason why we should expect modern audiences who view Impressionism in museums or in reproductions in the home to attribute the same meanings to the works as did nineteenth-century viewers. Nor is there any reason for such a discrepancy to upset us. Price's perspective implies that the meaning of "tribal" art should be frozen in time and space (i.e., in the time and space of its societies of origin)-a perspective that Price rightly criticizes when applied by others to "tribal" art in its societies of origin. This is not to suggest an individualistic model, according to which individuals "create" meaning in their private homes. Indeed, many of the meanings suggested in this study are patterned and classifiable into a limited number of types, just like the configurations of the neighborhoods in which resi- dents live and the uses of space in their homes. But this study does suggest that many of these patterned meanings emerge in the complex processes of the everyday lives of the audience-processes beyond the power of any cultural group to monitor easily, let alone control. Of course some qualifications are called for. This discus- sion has been based on a small-scale study, in a particular, but pivotal, region. There is clearly a need for more research on the reception of "primitive" art by audiences in their homes, both in other regions of the United States and abroad. In drawing attention to the social and political meaning that residents find in the artifacts, I do not mean to deny that residents may also relate to them on an aesthetic level. Nevertheless, the view presented here does at least propose possible explanations for the particular shape taken by the taste for "primitive" art in the twentieth-century West. The traditional view, by contrast, can explain little about this shape, except in a manner that is circular. For example, those wedded to aesthetic explanations of developments in taste have a readymade answer to all questions. Each form is chosen for display because it is aesthetically superior. Thus African sculpture predominates over other types of African art, such as jewelry or basketry, because it is of a higher visual caliber; the mask finally gained acceptance because in the end its aesthetic qualities could not be denied. And so on. Considered alone, each of these explanations may suffice. Put together, their circularity and Hegelian implications of an aesthetic spirit advancing toward world-historical perfec- tion become apparent. Further, the traditional view assumes that audience interest follows, in time, that of the "cultural gatekeepers," even though the testimony of knowledgeable art historians suggests that the purchasing audience is as often in front of the cultural gatekeepers as it is behind them. Rather than berate Western audiences for failing to at- tribute the same meanings to "tribal" objects as are attrib- uted to them in their societies of origin, it may be time to acknowledge that such a discrepancy is inevitable. Rather than see Western audiences as capable of little more than dutifully following where Western artists and critics lead, or</page><page sequence="18">414 THE ART BULLETIN SEPTEMBER 1993 VOLUME LXXV NUMBER 3 ,,~?~l , ?li ,, ;k . .. .
