Fowler Exponent Failure Analysis Associates Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT Testing techniques for creating rollovers have been a subject of much study and discussion, although previous work has concentrated on creating a repeatable laboratory test for evaluating and comparing vehicle designs. The two testing methodologies presented here address creating rollover tests that closely mimic a specific accident scenario, and are useful in accident reconstruction and evaluation of vehicle performance in specific situations. In order to be able to recreate accidents on off-road terrain, a test fixture called the Roller Coaster Dolly (RCD) was developed. With the RCD a vehicle can be released at speed onto flat or sloping terrain with any desired initial roll, pitch and yaw angle. This can be used to create rollover collisions from the trip stage on, including scenarios such as furrow trip on an inclined road edge. In order to be able to study the entire crash sequence associated with on-road maneuver-induced rollovers, a test methodology utilizing a crashworthy steering controller was developed and evaluated. With this, high- speed on-road maneuver induced rollovers can be recreated with precise input control, and without the limitations necessary for the safety of human drivers, such as the need for outriggers. Both of these test methodologies are outlined in this paper and examples of tests utilizing each are described. INTRODUCTION Rollover crashes are complex events with many factors influencing the initiation of the rollover as well as the subsequent motion of the vehicle. It is not surprising then, that analyzing these crashes from a reconstruction and/or vehicle or roadway design perspective is often not a straightforward task and the results may be open to question. Consequently, there exists a need for testing methods that can accurately replicate pre-crash and at- crash conditions existing in real-world rollovers. Testing of this nature can be used to validate (or invalidate) accident reconstructions or to evaluate alternative vehicle designs in a similar accident scenario. Techniques for automobile rollover tests have been developed and presented before. In 1972 Wilson and Gannon [1] presented the history of rollover test technology, including static tip-over, ramped rollovers, an early soil trip test and FMVSS 208 dolly rollover testing. In the early 1980s General Motors ran a series of dolly rollovers referred to as the Malibu test series [2], which significantly advanced the understanding of rollover behavior as well as occupant kinematics in such events. A research program conducted by Failure Analysis Associates in the late 1980's presented a method for lateral soil trip and curb trip rollover testing [3,4], Results from these tests were compared to each other and to dolly rollover tests. Vehicle tip-up testing utilizing programmable steering controllers have also been used in the past. In the 1970s Dynamic Science conducted a series of tip-up tests on the Jeep CJ-5. In these tests the steering controller was used in conjunction with a driver and outriggers on the vehicle. In 1990 Dynamic Research reported on a research project utilizing a programmable steering controller to study on the effect of modified suspensions on the tip-up propensity of light trucks [5]. For these maneuvers the test vehicles were fitted with outriggers and guided driverless to the test pad with a remote control operated from a chase vehicle. The steering controller was used to generate a matrix of incrementally varying steering (and braking) inputs to map the vehicle's response. A 1993 study by the University of Missouri-Columbia used a driverless vehicle with a path following steering controller to maneuver the vehicle into either a curb, loose soil, or pavement test area [8]. Although outriggers were used, they were set rather high so that most of the trip phase of the rollover is simulated. The only tip-ups that occurred were in the loose soil or curb impact tests, no pavement-trip tip-ups were generated. Vehicle speeds in this test program were limited to 42-mph and lower. 2139</page><page sequence="2">Most recently NHTSA's Rollover Research Program [6] utilized a steering controller to investigate a series of maneuvers that may induce on-road untripped rollovers in light vehicles. The NHTSA used the steering controller detailed by Heitzman in reference [7]. The use of outriggers in handling and rollover testing has some drawbacks due to the effect of the outriggers on the vehicle's dynamic behavior and the entire rollover accident sequence can not be tested. Furthermore, speeds are limited with a driver/outrigger combination because of safety implications - the risk of rim strikes or rapid tip-ups make testing at higher speeds prohibitively risky. In this paper, two new rollover test methods are described. The first method presented addresses off- road soil-tripped rollovers. For this approach, a test fixture called the Roller Coaster Dolly (RCD) was developed. With the RCD a vehicle can be released at speed onto flat or sloping terrain with any desired initial roll, pitch and yaw angle. This can be used to create rollover collisions from the trip stage on, including scenarios such as furrow trip on an inclined road edge. To study rollovers induced by an on-road maneuver, a test methodology utilizing a cable guide and tow system and a crashworthy steering controller was developed and evaluated. With this, high-speed on-road rollovers can be recreated with high precision input control, and without the limitations necessary for the safety of human drivers, such as the need for outriggers. ROLLER COASTER DOLLY Soil-tripped rollover testing that has been reported in the past has been limited to testing on level surfaces. The goal of much of this testing was to research the mechanism of furrow trip rollover and rollover propensity, where including test surface slope would add unnecessary complexity and variation to the results. However, when the objective is to recreate a specific accident scenario these variables often can not be ignored. The majority of rollover accidents occur off-road, where the surface is often sloped or uneven. The inclination of the surface where the rollover occurs can be an important factor in why and how the rollover occurs. In order to be able to recreate this type of accident in a controlled testing environment, a device called the Roller Coaster Dolly was developed. The RCD consists of a platform that rides on a pair of tubular rails in a manner similar to a roller coaster. Channels or plates are mounted to the platform on which a vehicle is positioned. The vehicle can be positioned on the dolly in any desired yaw, pitch or roll orientation. A photograph of the RCD with a test vehicle mounted is shown in Figure 1 . Figure 1 . Vehicle on Roller Coaster Dolly A wire rope tow system accelerates the dolly to the desired speed. As the RCD approaches the release point, the rail descends into a trough so that the top surface of the dolly is level with the soil test surface. At the release point, the dolly is very quickly decelerated over a short distance by compressing aluminum honeycomb stacks against concrete blocks affixed in the ground. The vehicle then slides off the dolly and onto the test surface. A photograph of the RCD at the release position is shown in Figure 2. Figure 2. Roller Coaster Dolly at Vehicle Release Position EXAMPLE TEST SETUP - The test series for which the RCD was originally developed involved releasing a sport utility vehicle onto a 15.5 degree banked road-edge in a side-slipped orientation. The required speed of the vehicle as it entered the soil was approximately 65 kph (40 mph) in a direction 8-degrees clockwise from the direction along the roadway. The vehicle was situated on the RCD with a yaw angle 30-degrees clockwise from perpendicular to the roadway. This test set-up is illustrated in Figure 3. 2140</page><page sequence="3">Figure 3. Test Configuration To achieve an accurate recreation of accident site conditions, the test site soil was prepared to reasonably match the soil at the accident site. Soil analysis consultants were hired to conduct field and laboratory tests on the accident site soil, which was characterized as a 'Brown, Clayey, Fine to Medium Sand'. The field tests documented the soil's compaction and moisture content, and laboratory tests determined the gradation (grain size distribution) and plasticity. Soil for the test site was prepared by mixing native soil at Exponent's Test and Engineering Center (TEC) and a fine sand to create a soil that closely matched the accident site soil, as shown in Figure 4. The test surface was then carefully watered and compacted to achieve density and moisture content measurements comparable to those found at the accident site. Table 1 lists the accident and test site density and moisture content values. Figure 4. Soil gradation comparison Table 1 . Soil Density and Moisture Content Dry Moisture Density Content (PCF) (%) - 20 ft from dolly, centerline 113.2 10.4 - 40 ft from dolly, centerline 111.7 9.9 - 60 ft from dolly, centerline 114.2 8Ü - 60 ft from dolly, 1 ft above 113.3 97Ī centerline Average for Test Site 113.1 9.6 Accident Site 113.3 10.0 EXAMPLE TEST RESULTS - Rollover crash tests were run with two different four-wheel-drive sport utility vehicles, a 1991 Jeep Wrangler and a 1986 Chevrolet S-10 Blazer. The speed of the dolly at release was 65.5 kph (40.7 mph) for the Wrangler and 66.1 kph (41 .1 mph) for the S-10 Blazer. The tests were documented with three real-time video and four high-speed film cameras. Both vehicles tripped due to soil furrowing, and came to rest on their wheels. The Wrangler furrowed approximately 6.3 m (21 ft) and rolled 360 degrees. The S-10 Blazer furrowed 5.5 m (18 ft) and rolled 720 degrees before coming to rest. In both tests the leading tires debeaded, so in the final sections of the furrows the rims were digging into the soil. The evidence marks and rest positions of the vehicles are illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, and Table 2 summarizes the test results. Table 2.

Jeep Wrangler Rest Position and Evidence Marks Figure 6. Chevrolet S-1 0 Blazer Rest Position and Evidence Marks 2142</page><page sequence="5">The distance traveled from trip to rest for the two vehicles was notably similar, lending credence to the generally accepted belief that the effective friction value used in reconstructing rollover accidents is relatively insensitive to the number of rolls. Assuming a constant deceleration from release to rest, the effective friction values are 0.79 g for the Wrangler rollover, and 0.76 g for the Blazer rollover. No attempt was made to account for the change in elevation of the vehicles during the rollover sequence because the rest positions were not significantly different in height from the release position. Review of the video coverage revealed that the Wrangler nearly came to a stop when it landed on its wheels after the rollover. It then rolled downhill on its wheels approximately its wheelbase further. Figures 7 and 8 show still frames taken from the video of both tests. If the total distance traveled is shortened by 1.5 m to account for this, the effective friction value increases to 0.85 g. The computed friction values compare well with the 0.8 - 0.93 g range reported by Cooperrider, et al [3,4] for soil tripped rollover tests conducted on level ground. Figure 7. S-1 0 Blazer Rollover Sequence 2143</page><page sequence="6">Figure 8. Jeep Wrangler Rollover Sequence 2144</page><page sequence="7">STEERING INDUCED ROLLOVER A pavement tripped rollover collision can be broken down into three phases. The first phase begins with a steering maneuver, often combined with braking and/or an excursion onto the road edge, which leads to severe yawing of the vehicle. The combination of yaw, body roll and lateral acceleration response leads to the second phase, where the vehicle begins to tip-up. This is often referred to as the 'pavement trip phase', which applies to the vehicle rolling past its stability point and all four tires leaving the ground. The third phase is the vehicle rolling and decelerating until it comes to rest. Previously test methods allowed only one or two of the phases of a pavement tripped rollover to be recreated. Handling tests with test drivers allowed for the steer maneuver and part of the trip phase to be analyzed, but driver safety required that outriggers arrest the roll in the early part of the trip phase. Dolly rollover tests have been used to simulate the rollover portion of the accident, but such tests do not address the handling phase, and can be questionable in terms of their accuracy in simulating the initial conditions of the rollover collision. In order to be able to recreate all of the phases of a pavement-tripped rollover collision, a new test methodology has been developed. With this procedure a driverless test vehicle is accelerated up to the desired speed and delivered onto an asphalt skid pad, using a cable tow and guide system. Once the vehicle is on the skidpad, a crashworthy steering controller generates the steering inputs that lead to the vehicle rolling over. In this way, all three phases of the pavement tripped rollover sequence are simulated. The following sections will describe the system used to tow the vehicle up to speed and deliver it onto the skidpad, the crashworthy steering controller used to provide the steering inputs, and the series of tests used to evaluate and develop this system. For the final test, in which the vehicle rolled 7 times, the known inputs and vehicle responses measured with the onboard instrumentation are reviewed. VEHICLE GUIDE AND TOW SYSTEM - Two methods were considered for accelerating the vehicle up to the desired speed and guiding it onto the skidpad. The first was a fully remote control system, whereby the vehicle would be driven by an off-board operator providing throttle, steer and brake commands to the vehicle via telemetry. This 'model airplane' approach had a number of problems, particularly since the system was intended to be used at speeds up to those typical of interstate highways. Accelerating a typical vehicle up to 120 kph (75 mph) under its own engine power would require an approach lane of at least one-half mile. This long of an approach lane would require a complicated guidance system to safely and reliably keep the vehicle on course. Although this method was not chosen, it is being considered for certain future applications. The other method, that was chosen, utilized the crash rail propulsion system at the Exponent Failure Analysis Associates Test and Engineering Center. With this system, acceleration power was generated by two V-8 engines delivered through a continuous loop of wire rope. This continuous loop was attached to a second length of wire rope which, through a system of tow connections and pulleys, propelled the test vehicle toward the skidpad. Routing the tow system between the skidpad and crash rail provided over a 245-m (800-foot) long acceleration lane. To guide the vehicle along this lane another wire rope was stretched along the desired path. A pivoted tow arm was connected to the front of the vehicle, which followed the guide cable via a 'tow shoe'. The tow arm was also attached to the vehicle's steering linkages with connecting rods which allowed the tow arm to steer the vehicle to follow the guide cable. Figure 9 is a photograph of this system. The cable guide and tow system was originally developed for propelling a vehicle in a crash test involving two moving vehicles. Figure 9. Vehicle Guide and Tow System AUTOMATED STEERING CONTROLLER - Once the vehicle was delivered onto the skidpad at the desired speed, the Automated Steering Controller (ASC) took over control of the vehicle. This steering controller consisted of an electric servo-motor replacing the steering wheel at the end of the steering shaft, a programmable servo controller, battery power packs, and a control module. The steering actuator used for this initial application is capable of generating steering rate and torque far beyond what would be demanded of an actual driver. The motor is rated to 82.3 N-m (60.7 ft-lb) peak torque and a peak angular rate of 3000 deg/s. It is designed to provide a continuous torque of approximately 81 N-m (60 ft-lb) at speeds up to approximately 1500 deg/s. Figure 10 shows the steering controller installed in the vehicle used for the initial development tests. As shown, the actuator is supported with two adjustable legs attached to the floor. 2145</page><page sequence="8">This configuration is sufficient for handling tests and tip- up onto the outriggers, and allows a driver to operate the vehicle. When the vehicle was subjected to a full rollover collision, a frame was constructed around the motor to strengthen its attachment to the vehicle and protect it from direct contact with the ground. When the ASC is used without a driver, the steering profile is initiated with a trigger signal to the programmable controller simultaneous with the start of data acquisition, and a remotely actuated braking system provides a way to abort a test or stop a rolling vehicle after a test. The brake system power is provided by a high pressure nitrogen bottle and control valve. When the control valve is opened, regulated pressure from the nitrogen bottle actuates a cylinder whose rod-end is connected to the brake pedal. In this way brake pedal effort can be set in advance by changing the regulation set point of the high pressure gas. The control valve is opened by either a transmitted signal - manually sent by an observing test engineer - or by a timed-delay box. The transmitted, manually controlled signal serves as the test abort and primary post-test brake application system. The time-delay box serves mainly as a backup, triggering the application of the brakes at a predetermined point in time after the start of the test. This delay time is usually set to an amount large enough to not apply the brakes until the expected maneuver is over. Figure 10. Automated Steering Controller When the ASC is used with an onboard driver the triggering sequence is reconfigured to ensure the safety of the driver. Once the vehicle is up to the desired speed and approaching the test area, an "Arm Controller" switch is depressed and held by the driver. This allows power to be supplied to the armatures of the motor and locks the steering in the straight ahead direction. The "Arm" switch also acts as a dead-man switch; if it is released at any time during a test, power is cut off from the motor and steering control is returned to the driver. As an additional safety feature, power to the motor is independent of the servo controller, so if the servo controller fails, the motor can still be turned off. To initiate the steering sequence, a "Trigger" button is then depressed. This requires the test driver to remove both hands from the steering wheel before the controller takes over. This is vital because the steering wheel is rigidly connected to the steering shaft and turns when the controller is operating. An unaware driver may otherwise find himself in danger of injury by holding onto the steering wheel as the controller begins to input what may be high rate steering requiring significant torque. DEVELOPMENT TEST SERIES -A series of development tests were conducted to evaluate the steering induced rollover test method. A 1985 Toyota 4WD Pickup was chosen as the test vehicle for this series. Initially, outriggers were installed on the vehicle so that multiple tests could be conducted without consuming the vehicle. The vehicle was instrumented to record: steering position and torque, three axes of acceleration, three axes of angular rate, left and right frame height to calculate roll angle, and longitudinal and lateral velocity. The data was recorded digitally with an on-board data acquisition system designed for conducting a multiple run test series such as is typical for most handling test programs. A total of 8 development test runs were conducted on the pickup with outriggers installed. The target speed for each test was either 97 or 120 kph (60 or 75 mph). The first two tests were 2-steer maneuvers, with steering inputs up to 200 degrees, and the remaining 6 tests were 3-steer maneuvers with inputs up to 300 degrees. Both trapezoidal and sinusoidal steering patterns were used. In none of these tests did the pickup tip onto the outriggers. Typically the vehicle yawed around so that it skidded to a stop nearly sideways. In most of the 3-steer maneuver tests, the vehicle responded so drastically to the 2nd steer that the tires were saturated, and the vehicle did not respond to the third steer. Following this series, the outriggers were removed and modifications were made to the instrumentation and steering controller for crashworthiness in the event of a rollover. A crashworthy data acquisition system replaced the handling test data acquisition system, and higher range accelerometers and a higher range yaw rate sensor were installed. The lower range handling test instruments were left in place to document the pre- rollover portion of the tests. The first two tests conducted without outriggers did not lead to rollover. The first one was a 300-degree 3-steer sinusoidal steering input test run at 120 kph. No additional ballast was added, but the weight of the servo motor, the frame protecting it from direct contact, and the various instrumentation brought the total weight very close to the vehicle weight at curb condition plus a driver and passenger. In this test the vehicle responded drastically to the initial steer to the left, had little response to the steer to the right, and then spun around on the reversal back to the left. Left rear wheel lift occurred during this test, but no tip-up. 2146</page><page sequence="9">For the next test, larger aftermarket wheels and tires were installed on the vehicle, and the steering input was changed to a trapezoidal profile of 160 left, 200 right and 350 left. A 120-kph initial speed was again targeted. In this test the pickup yawed around so drastically in response to the second steer that it did not respond at all to the third steer. The vehicle did not tip-up, and no wheel lift could be seen on the video. To help achieve the goal of evaluating the system in an actual rollover collision, a third test was performed in which 118 kg (260 lb) of steel ballast weight was added to the vehicle just below the rear window. This resulted in a weight distribution similar to having a 90 kg (200 lb), driver and passenger, and a 113 kg (250 lb) toolbox in the bed. With the larger tires but heavier test weight, the ride height increased by about 0.8 cm (0.3 in). ROLLOVER DEVELOPMENT TEST - In this test run, the goal of conducting a steering induced rollover was achieved. With a trapezoidal steering input of 160 right, 180 left, and 350 right, the modified vehicle responded to all three steers and tipped-up as it yawed in response to the third steer. The speed at release from tow was 78 mph, and the vehicle traveled approximately 108 m (355 ft) before it left the ground and rolled for another 80 m (260 ft). Over this distance it rolled 7 times with 3 severe ground contacts, coming to rest on it's wheels. Figures 1 1 and 12 contain photographs taken during and after the test. Figures 13-15 contain a sample of the test data recorded with the onboard instrumentation. The first plot shows the recorded steering input. Steering rates used were 800 deg/s to the right, 755 deg/s to the left, and 964 deg/s back to the right. The steering inputs applied in this test program are very severe given the high travel speed of the vehicle and are clearly not representative of a controlled maneuver. The vehicle response to these inputs also shows the severity of the maneuver, with lateral acceleration going from 0.7 g in the first steer, quickly reversing to 0.8 g in response to the second steer input, and then reaching a peak of 1 .07 g prior to rolling over. The vehicle speed and its reduction during each phase of the maneuver is shown in the next plot. Sideslip is measured with the velocity sensor and the value at the vehicle's center-of-gravity is calculated using the measured yaw rate. Sideslip reaches its left steer peak value of +18.5 degrees (a positive sign indicates a sideslip angle to the right of the longitudinal axis of the vehicle) at about 2.1 s. The final right steer quickly reverses the sideslip angle, and by tip-up it is -12 degrees. The sideslip angle continues to increase after tip-up, and by 3.05 s it is about -18 degrees. Beyond 3.05 s both the vehicle speed and sideslip data are suspect. An optical velocity sensor was used, and as the vehicle rolls past 20 degrees the distance from the sensor to the ground becomes too large for accurate measurements. Roll and Yaw charts are given on the next page. The angular rates were measured with a solid-state gyro, and were integrated to obtain roll and yaw angle. It was noted from the video footage that, in the 1 80-degrees-to-the-left second steer, the left rear wheel lifted considerably from the ground. This occurred at a roll angle of 10 degrees, the maximum roll angle achieved during the left steer. Considering 1 0 degrees a roll angle limit above which 2- wheel lift and rollover would occur, after the third steer the vehicle would be considered tipping-up at approximately 2.9 s. This time is coincidental with the peak lateral acceleration in the final turn of 1.07 g. The vehicle continues to roll, with all four wheels leaving the asphalt at approximately 3.3 s. At tip-up, the yaw rate had leveled off at approximately 70 deg/s, coming down from a peak of 81 deg/s occurring 0.26 s (approximately 25 feet) earlier. At tip-up, the vehicle had yawed 21 degrees to the right from the original straight-ahead path, reaching a maximum angle of 45 degrees when all four wheels left the asphalt. Figure 15 shows the data taken to document the rollover portion of the test. The vertical acceleration data indicated that the most severe ground contact occurred at 5.9 s, at the roof hit after three revolutions. The impulse from this hit was approximately 60 g when filtered to Class 60 (100-Hz lowpass filter). This impulse caused the roll rate sensor to malfunction for approximately two-thirds of a second. A straight line approximation was substituted for the erroneous data, which is seen as the straight line from 6.0 to 6.6 s. The substituted data was created to span the bad section and integrate out to 2,520 degrees of roll, the seven revolutions that occurred. Horizontal acceleration is the calculated acceleration perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the vehicle and parallel to the ground. The data was lowpass filtered at 10 Hz for this calculation. Properly combining the measured lateral and vertical acceleration values is dependant on the calculated roll angle being accurate. 2147</page><page sequence="10">Figure 1 1 .

Probably the most common use is to recreate fixed object collisions, such as a vehicle sliding sideways into a guardrail or pole. The RCD works very well for these type of collisions because the yaw, pitch and roll orientation can be accurately controlled. A method has been developed to simulate braking deceleration prior to releasing the vehicle from the dolly, which can help to better recreate the forces on occupants for some accident scenarios. A capability we would like to develop is the ability to give the vehicle angular momentum at release. Methods to do this have been discussed, but manifestation of this in an accurate and controlled fashion appears to be complicated. Analysis of the steering controlled rollover test data is only in its initial stages. This data will be further examined with the intent of developing a better understanding of the on-road rollover event. Further analysis of the non-rollover tests and all of the preliminary, outrigger tests will provide insight into the parameters that dictate whether or not a rollover is imminent. Such work will be detailed in future reports. This test series, and others to come using this technology, will also serve to further examine the methodologies used by the accident reconstructionist in analyzing an on road rollover accident. Such topics include: lateral acceleration and speed estimation from skid mark length and curvature, interpretation of skid mark striations, estimation of trip speed and vehicle roll rate at trip, and estimation of lateral acceleration required for trip. Work is also planned in the continued design and development of the remote controlled test vehicle system. Throttle and brake control systems will be added to allow for research into their effect in accident avoidance maneuvers, and how such additional driver inputs may prevent or produce rollovers. Up to this point the steering pattern implemented by the controller has been predetermined (open loop), but the ability for the ASC to generate vehicle inputs based on instrumentation feedback (closed loop) could be implemented. The steering controller was designed specifically to be flexible, an important feature is that the system is not tied to one specific actuator. To allow for conducting rollover tests with anthropomorphic test dummies in the vehicle, a version of the actuator to be installed in the engine compartment will be developed. This will leave the passenger compartment unaltered, allowing for accurate replication of the crash environment for injury assessment. Development of rollover test instrumentation and data processing techniques is also progressing. As described earlier, low range, highly sensitive instruments are preferred for the portion of the maneuver leading up to 2153 the rollover. When rollover occurs, more robust, high range sensors are required to adequately capture the details of what can be a very destructive event. Techniques for properly instrumenting test vehicles and then processing the data in such a way as to fully capture the tip-up and rollover are still developing. CONCLUSIONS The testing methods introduced here expand the realm of rollover collision scenarios that can be recreated by testing. These tools can be used for recreating specific accidents of interest, or can be used as part of controlled studies of to evaluate vehicle performance in various rollover collision scenarios. The ASC will also be valuable in conducting vehicle handling research. Precisely controlled and repeatable vehicle inputs will be achieved, whether or not the testing requires a driver in the vehicle. The use of both these methods will provide a great deal of useful information for accident reconstruction. Currently, most information related to vehicle deceleration during rollover, especially for on-pavement rollovers, was obtained from the study of dolly rollover tests. There is little, if any, information concerning vehicle deceleration during the yaw-to-trip phase of a rollover. The methods introduced here provide a means for obtaining valuable accident reconstruction information under realistic conditions. BIBLIOGRAPHY 1.
