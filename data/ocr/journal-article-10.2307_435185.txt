<plain_text><page sequence="1">"JEAN DE MEUNG," ANTIFEMINISM, AND "BOURGEOIS REALISM" LIONEL J. FRIEDMAN JEAN DE MEUNG'S antifeminism is a standard clich6, and the lines usually cited to epitomize this point of view are in the coarsely crude couplet: "Toutes estes, sereiz e fustes / De fait ou de volent6 putes."' The practice is then to contrast his attitude with that of Guil- laume de Lorris and to declare that the latter's portion of the Roman de la rose re- flects the sentiments and ideals of "court- ly" literature, while Jean de Meung's be- longs rather to a current of "bourgeois realism." This paper will examine the va- lidity of ascribing the couplet to Jean de Meung as his personal opinion and of terming the surrounding passage either "bourgeois" or "realistic."' First, we must determine the context within which the statement is made, a procedure curiously seldom followed by critics of Jean de Meung, who treat in- stead each line as a direct expression of the author's opinion. This is consistent with the commonly held notion that his section of the work is encyclopedic and didactic. In the larger economy of the Rose, the couplet occurs in the long discourse of the Ami instructing the Amant how to win and hold the affection of his lady, con- sonant with Books i and ii of Ovid's Ars amatoria. In this development, having cited the idyllic example of the Golden Age, the Ami demonstrates the termina- tion of this happy state through a rise of desires for seigneurie and maistrie. Briefly, the thesis developed is the topic of the in- compatibility of amour and seigneurie:2 Trestuit pareil estre soulaient, Ne rien propre aveir ne voulaient; Bien savaient cele parole, Qui n'est mengongiere ne fole, Qu'onques amour e seignourie Ne s'entrefirent compaignie, Ne ne demourerent ensemble: Cil qui maistrie les dessemble [ll. 8447-54]. The incompatibility of the two sentiments is best demonstrated by their consequence in marriage: Pour ce veit l'en des mariages, Quant li mariz cuide estre sages, E chastie sa fame e bat, E la fait vivre en tel debat (Qu'il dit qu'ele est nice e fole Dont tant demeure a la querole, E don el hante si souvent Des jolis vallez le couvent) Que bone amour n'i peut durer, Tant s'entrefont maus endurer, Quant cil veaut la maistrise aveir Dou cors sa fame et de l'aveir [ll. 8455-66]. The Ami expands his demonstration by the vivid portrayal or efguratio of the 1 Quotations are from Guillaume de Lorris et Jean de Meung, Le Roman de la rose, ed. Ernest Langlois (Paris: Societ4 des Anciens Textes Fran(ais, 1914-24). 2 The same topic is developed in the courtly con- text of "The Franklin's Tale": "For o thyng, sires, saufly dar I seye, That freendes everych oother moot obeye, If they wol longe holden compaignye. Love wol nat been constreyned by maistrye. Whan maistrie comth, the God of Love anon, Beteth his wynges, and farewel, he is gon! Love is a thyng as any spirit free. Wommen, of kynde, desiren libertee, And nat to been constreyned as a thral; And so doon men, if I sooth seyen shal" (Geoffrey Chaucer, Works, ed. F. N. Robinson [Bos- ton, 1957], "The Franklin's Tale," vss. 761-70). The basis of this topic seems to be Ovidian sen- tentia: "non bene conueniunt nec in una sede morantur maiestas et amor" (Metamorphoses ii. 846-47). [MODERN PHILOLOGY, August, 1959] 13</page><page sequence="2">14 LIONEL J. FRIEDMAN diatribe of an irate husband desiring mas- tery over his wife. Rhetorically, the figure is sermocinatio, the genre, invective. During this long invective, the husband makes the statement ascribed to the author. The context established, the problem is partially clarified, and we wonder on what grounds the couplet abstracted from so complex a setting has been ascribed to the author, for this is to say that the hus- band's opinion is that of Jean de Meung. An analogous situation would arise if a critic were to ascribe to Molibre an idea expressed by one of the characters pre- sented by C6limane during the malicious portrait scene of Le Misanthrope. Within the Rose, Jean de Meung is several degrees removed from the irate husband-a char- acter created by the Ami, who, in turn, is a character created by the author. Clearly, moreover, the opinions expressed by the husband are not the ideas of the Ami, who explicitly informs the Amant that he is holding up such a figure as a horrible ex- ample of someone who ought to be fed to the wolves and whose conduct can only bring his wife to hate him. The husband is the antithesis of the thesis advanced by the Ami (11. 9436-42). If the opinions of the Ami and the irate husband are dia- metrically opposed, are the opinions of the Ami alone to be equated with those of Jean de Meung? We may even at this moment raise a more basic question: Are any of the ideas expressed in the Roman de la rose the opinions of Jean de Meung? We are told much about this person, but slight indeed are the available facts. The major portion of this so familiar fig- ure is the sheer fabrication of critics who have constructed a persona from their in- terpretations and misinterpretations of the romance. If we but imagine that the Roman de la rose had perished while the vulgar translation of the De amicitia spirituali of Aelreid of Rievalux had sur- vived, we may see the apparent dangers of the method, for the same critics would have presented us as complete, but vastly different, a construct of Jean de Meung, fervent with Christian charity, absorbed in Cistercian mysticism, a follower of St. Bernard of Clairvaux. Let us dispense with this bizarre modern personification of the genius of the Rose which critics have named Jean de Meung. Rather than pro- ject the work back upon a constructed personification (which may lead us to be- lieve that such an abstraction really once existed), is it not preferable and more logi- cal to carry on the discussion on the level of the poem itself, the existence and real- ity of which are fairly assured? Some may object that the author ex- plicitly appears in the work as the narra- tive ego, the Amant. Here we must go for- ward with caution, for the Amant is a stock character of medieval comedy and romance. Convention, having no neces- sary equivalence with the author's own thought, determines his development: he is the stylized hero of any romance. Even though in the prophecy of the Dieu d'amours Jean de Meung identifies him- self with the Amant, this identification is risky, for it is difficult to determine whether the passage conveys more than that Jean de Meung inherited the narra- tive ego along with the narrative and de- cided for his present purposes to play this particular, conventionally determined role. This is by no means a novel point of view in the Middle Ages, having been ex- pressed a century and a half earlier by Baudri of Bourgueil in defense of his own works, just as Chaucer was to advance it a century later to exculpate himself from blame occasioned by the necessities of his mateere.3 Consistently overlooked in dis- 3 "Et cur scribatur nisi scriptum forte legatur? ergo quod pueros demulceat atque puellas scripsimust ut pueris id consonet atque puellis sicque meum relegatur opus uolitetque per orbem</page><page sequence="3">"JEAN DE MEUNG," ANTIFEMINISM, AND "BOURGEOIS REALISM" 15 cussions of the Rose is that, though pre- senting various aspects, it is a love story and as such belongs to the genre of medie- val elegy-more specifically, of medieval comedy, for the ending is happy. Medie- val comedy had, of course, certain stock characters: "Introducitur in comedia per- fecta maritus et uxor eius et adulter et minister adulteri uel eius castigator, et nutrix adultere uel seruus mariti."4 These characters are readily recognized in the medieval courtly romance as the Jaloux, the Maitresse, the Amant, the Ami, and the Vieille or the Lozengier. The poetic effort of Jean de Meung consisted essen- tially in the prosopopoeia of these stock characters along with that of some of his own creation, as well as that of the psy- chologic or sociologic personifications pre- viously introduced by the first author. Muscatine has discussed the production of a "psychologic novel" by Guillaume de Lorris through the creation and manipula- tion of these personifications,5 while Gunn has amply demonstrated the conversion by Jean de Meung of the original rose- quest story into a vast medieval disputatio on love, during which are upheld various, differing, frequently conflicting, theses.6 The psychological moments or dynamisms of Guillaume de Lorris have become doc- tores amoris in Jean de Meung. The later author's attempt was, through ethopoeia, to assign the appropriate doctrines to the stock characters in accord with the ad- monition of the antique rhetoricians: lravraxov  oioELS 7T OLKELOV rprov 70ToS VrOKE/cepOS 'pooC'rOL~ TE Kal Katpots.'7 The doctrines must be appropriate to the characters. This is perhaps the most genial aspect of Jean de Meung's art, and he should be given full credit for it. We cannot overstress the serious limita- tions placed by conventions of the genre upon any attempt to project the ideas back upon a reconstructed author. For example, the age of the feigned narrative ego of the Rose imposes at the outset a qualification on any interpretation to be made of the whole poem. The dream takes place during the Amant's twentieth year "ou point qu'Amors prent le paage des jeunes gens." Youth, for the Middle Ages, was the period particularly of "fole amour," and it is difficult to find in medie- val romances loved, lovable, or even lovely persons who have passed this age. It is a constant that youth is equated with summer, the characteristic element of which is fire.

FRIEDMAN ardor are the equivalents of luxuria.8s Whatever the outcome of the debate in the Roman de la rose, the solution is valid only if limited by the context of youth. In both parts of the Rose, Raison argues with the Amant just as Reason debates with the hero, heroine, or permutated Amour in any courtly romance and goes to in- evitable defeat. Jean de Meung has been criticized for "needlessly" reintroducing Raison into the narrative. Yet this second appearance was necessitated by her changed function. In the work of Guil- laume de Lorris, she is merely the conven- tional personification of a moment in the love process: transformed by Jean de Meung, she becomes the proponent of several doctrines of rational love drawn from Boethius, Cicero, and the Bible. Considering the age assigned to the fic- tional Amant and the genre, some ex- ponent of some variety of fole amour is foreordained to triumph, and Raison is foredoomed to failure. Such triumph or failure is valid, however, only when quali- fied by its determining factors-youth, love, and literary genre. It is determined by the subject matter, not the author's thought. In his prophecy, for example, the Dieu d'amours declares that the future Jean de Meung "n'aura cure de Raison" and will complete the work. It is the sub- ject matter, not the author's personal preference, which determines the course of the romance. To construct authors con- sistent with the climate of their day, we should have to admit that both Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meung doubtless believed that love, like youth itself, would pass, to be replaced by something cooler, saner, preferable. It is also most hard to imagine that either author of the Rose was unaware that many of the delightful gar- den folk, from Oiseuse to the Dieu d'amours, are other than gilded vices or worse. To return to the other characters of medieval comedy, the distinction between the "nutrix adultere" and the "seruus mariti" depends on whether the character is allied with the husband or the wife, and at times the Vieille, as occurs in Marie de France's Yonec, may even be on the side of the husband. When the Vieille is allied with the Maltresse, there is a community of interests between the Amant, the Maitresse, the Ami, and the Vieille against the common enemy, the Mari or the Jaloux. The roles of these characters are too well known to require comment, but we wonder that these strictly conven- tional characters have not been more widely recognized as such in the Roman de Ia rose and have, on the contrary, been at- tributed to a bourgeois origin or, worse, to real-life sources. A partial answer is the facile clich6 generally held that "courtly literature" exalts and idealizes women, while "bourgeois" literature is antifemi- nist or at least takes a less noble view. Gilson has already objected to the cava- lier fashion in which, starting from this a priori notion, critics have divided up not only the whole of medieval literature but 8 Philippe de Novarre, Les quatre ages de l'homme, ed. Marcel de Fr6ville (Paris: Soci~t6 des Anciens Textes Francais, 1888), pp. 21-22. The relation of youth to love and of maturity to reason is thematic in the Ballades of Charles d'Orl~ans. Jennesse declares in regard to the Dieu d'amours that she is " de sa re- tenue" and "sa servante treschiere" ("Retenue d'Amours"). The same relation is condemned in the "Songe en complainte" vss. 17-48, where Folie is at- tributed to Amour. Love's position in a scheme of values is represented metaphorically in the "Lettre de retenue": Cupid and Venus declare themselves to be sovereign over Mondaine Liesse, and "plusieurs Plaisirs Mondains" are witnesses. The relation of Love to Youthe and Eld is propounded by John Gower in the Confessio amantis, Book viii, where, despite the exemplary figures of elderly lovers offered by David and Bersabee, Solomon, Samson and Dalila, Aris- totle and the Queen of Greece, Virgil, Plato, and Ovid, the sentence of Venus is that the poet "make a pleine To love, which takth liteY ,a Of olde men upon the nede, Whan that the lustes ben aweie" (Gower, Works, ed. G. C. Macaulay [Oxford, 1901], III, 465).</page><page sequence="5">"JEAN DE MEUNG," ANTIFEMINISM, AND "BOURGEOIS REALISM" 17 separate poems within the work of a single author, and even separate lines within a single poem.9 Medieval texts the "courtli- ness" of which has never been questioned contain antifeminist passages as strong as those of the Rose-L'~itre pirilleux, for ex- ample.'0 The Jaloux of Chr~tien de Troyes's Perceval acts and speaks no dif- ferently, albeit more briefly, than does the Jaloux of the Rose." We should scarcely be justified in extracting this passage from the Perceval as proof that Chritien de Troyes held women in low esteem and be- longed to a current of "bourgeois real- ism." Once we establish the irate husband as the antithesis of the Ami's thesis, the ascription of the couplet and of an anti- courtly attitude to the second part of the Rose becomes more paradoxical, for the thesis advanced by the Ami is a standard tenet of courtly love expounded in the De amore of Andreas Capellanus: the necessity of a gratuitous quality to love. Love is impossible between spouses be- cause such freedom no longer exists, hav- ing been replaced by marital duty.'2 Part of this strange misunderstanding of the thesis results from a failure to recognize an expository method characteristic of medieval argumentation and of this par- ticular romance: reasoning or demonstra- tion by contraries, the rotva'rioz of the ancient rhetoricians. Par6 has already il- luminated the Aristotelian and scholastic bases of the technique.'3 In urging men to have experience with all varieties of wom- en, the Amant as the Passionate Pilgrim expounds the theory of contraries: Ainsinc va des contraires choses: Les unes sont des autres gloses; E qui l'en en veaut defenir, De l'autre li deit souvenir, Ou ja, par nule entencion, N'i metra diffinicion; Car qui des deus n'a quenoissance Ja n'i quenoistra diference, Senz quei ne peut venir en place Diffinicion que l'en face [ll. 21573-582]. In the case of the irate husband, critics have taken the gloss, and a contrary one to boot, for the text. As we might expect from their united front against the Jaloux, a similarity may be found to the views of the Ami in both the discourses of the Vieille and the Amant. The thesis which the former ad- vances is not directed against seigneurie as much as against exclusiveness. By nature, women were born free, but law has re- moved them from their natural freedom: D'autre part, eus sont franches nees; Lei les a condicionees, Qui les oste de leur franchises, Ou Nature les avait mises; Car Nature n'est pas si sote Qu'ele face naitre Marote Tant seulement pour Robichon, Se l'entendement i fichon, Ne Robichon pour Mariete, Ne pour Agnes, ne pour Perrete [ll. 13875-884]. The rest of the argument is familiar: originally each man captured the woman who appealed to him, unless someone stronger took her away. This led to blood- shed and the breakdown of family life, since the male departed, once sated. The laws of monogamy were instituted by "le conseil des omes sages" (11. 13907-916) to assure the family and decrease the "ba- SEtienne Gilson, La Thdologie mystique de Saint Bernard (''ftudes de philosophie m~di~vale," Vol. XX [Paris, 1947]), Appendix IV, pp. 193-94. 1o L'otre pbrilleux, ed.

FRIEDMAN tailles que li con esmurent"'4 (1. 13924). Nevertheless, both women and men have a tendency to return to their state of nat- ural, promiscuous freedom, despite shame or fear of punishment (11. 14092-103). From these passages, free love and com- munity of wives are also supposed to be ideas advocated by Jean de Meung! Ob- viously, this is inaccurate. The idea of "natural state" is advanced to explain an observable phenomenon, not as a project of social reform. The argument of the Vieille is parallel to that of natural law and the law of nations, which she has ex- pressed as "nature" and "lei." There are no more grounds for assuming that Jean de Meung would have advocated that marriage customs revert to a state of pure nature than that he would have suggested the abolition of contemporary law in favor of "natural law." The passages are not conclusions of the author but moments in the argumentation of one of the dispu- tants. In her discourse, the Vieille disputes two specific precepts of the Dieu d'a- mours, concerning (a) generosity and (b) keeping one's heart in one place.'15 Cer- tainly, the other characters-Raison, Ami, Amant, Nature, Genius, and Bel Accueil--roundly damn the conclusions of the Vieille, not for their factual basis, but for the venal ends to which she directs them.16 Both the thesis of the Ami on the incompatibility of Amour and seigneurie and the Vieille's observations on the con- tradiction between lei and nature are com- bined a century later in a balade of Eu- stache Deschamps, "La loy souvent con- traire a la nature," the value of which is to show how a poet closer in time to the Rose interpreted and redeveloped the same themes in a context patently "courtly.""7 At the moment of plucking the Rose, the Passionate Pilgrim, too, has some- thing to say about the freedom which should be allowed women: E si m'en mis en grant destreit, Tant trouvai le passage estreit; Car largement ne fust ce pas Que je trespassasse le pas; E se bien l'estre dou pas sai, Nus n'i avait onques pass6; Car j'i passai touz li prumiers; N'encor n'iere pas coustumiers Li leus de receveir paages. Ne sai s'il fist puis d'avantages Autant aus autres come a mei; Mais bien vous di que tant l'amai 14 This, too, seems to have been a topic. The rape of Helen began the Trojan War; Briseis is the cause of Achilles' wrath; Herodotus places the rape of women at the beginning of his history. In the Alexandrian romance of Chariton, such reflections add to the anxieties of Dionysius: "prm  akiXdpave a6ITy, raXater ~ayI7tr7"wv, 6oat ieracoXaL yeyb6aor 7"cV KaXGv yvva~~Kv" (Charitonis Aphrodisiensis, De Chaerea et Callirhoe, ed. Warren E. Blake [Oxford, 1938], A, 7, 7, p. 67). Athenaeus presents a list of references to an- cient Greek use of the topic in the Deipnosophists xiii. 560. It may be found in Aristophanes' Acharnenses and in Priapeum XXIX. 15 The role of the Dieu d'amours in the Rose as the exponent of courtly love only as defined by Andreas Capellanus requires clarification. Not previously re- marked is that, in his condemnation of Andreas' work, Bishop Etienne Tempier entitles it De amore, siue de deo amoris. Jean de Meung's treatment of Guillaume de Lorris' portion seems to indicate an awareness that the doctrine expounded by the Dieu d'amours is specifically that of Andreas Capellanus. 16 The classical origins of the Vieille, her use in medieval "Latin comedy," and her proliferation in European romance and courtly literature have been well elucidated. Her connections with moral literature must still be traced. In the letter Ad Furiam de uiduitate seruanda St. Jerome warns: "Caue nutrices et gerulas et istius modi uinosa animalia, quae de corio tuo saturare uentrem suum cupiunt. Non suadent, quod tibi, sed, quod sibi prosit, et saepe illud obgan- niunt: 'Solane perpetua maerens carpere iuuenta/ Nec dulces natos Ueneris nec praemia noris?' " (Jerome, Select Letters, ed. F. A. Wright ["Loeb Classi- cal Library" (London, 1933)], p. 234). In his Summa, Guillaume Perault lists the Vieille among the incita- menta luxurie: "Dicendum est de his que prestant occasionem huic peccato, que sunt viij: ocium, indis- creta sumptio cibi et potus, exhortatio uetularum uel aliarum personarum que sunt consiliatrices turpitu- tidinis, et prauum exemplum, aspectus mulierum, col- loquium, auditus uel cantilenarum amatoriarum uel instrumentorum musicorum uel turpiloquiorum, et tactus" (Guilelmus Peraldus, Summa aurea de uirtuti- bus et uitiis [Venice, 1497], "De luxuria"). With the exceptions of dietary indiscretions and bad example, the other factors are dynamisms of or moments in the progression of "courtly" love. 17 Eustache Deschamps, (uvres completes (Paris: Societe de Anciens Textes FranCais, 1878-1903), I, 225-26.</page><page sequence="7">"JEAN DE MEUNG," ANTIFEMINISM, AND "BOURGEOIS REALISM" 19 Que je ne le poi onques creire, Neis se ce fust chose veire; Car nus de legier chose amee Ne mescreit, tant seit diffamee: Ne si ne le crei pas encores [ll. 21651-667]. This conventionally correct attitude for the courtly lover is upheld elsewhere in the exemplum of Mars and Venus (11. 14157-186, 18061-129). In all these instances we are dealing with the expressed opinions of stock char- acters, behind whom we may not see with any certainty the personal views of the author. As has been recognized by Gunn, the "sententia" of the Rose is probably to be found in the discourses of two charac- ters added by Jean de Meung-Nature, and Genius.'s Curiously enough, in a speech of Genius to Nature-one of the more violently antifeminist passages in the whole romance-warning men never to let women have the upper hand, he states a positive relation of men to women (11. 16617-652). The lines are consistent, in stating that women should be allowed to come and go as they please, with the doctrines of the Ami, the Vieille, and the Amant. Whether the specific attitude-- applicable to a high-born, merchant-class, or artisan wife-outlined by Genius should be called "courtly" or "bourgeois" must be deferred until these terms are better defined than at present. The discourse of Genius to Nature of- fers several peculiarities. It is avowedly an attempt to raise the spirits of disconsolate Nature (11. 16707-711), to calm her over- wrought state. To effect this, Genius de- velops the "sententia" fame legierement d'ire s'enflame (11. 16323-324). The exposi- tion of the dangers of confiding secrets to a woman is contingent upon this initial theme. Genius does not say that women are at all times perfidious. He claims that, since women are easily moved to wrath, do not tell them anything which may be used against you when they are angry. This certainly refers back to the secrets of Man's waywardness outlined by Nature in her plaint. In its most general aspect, Genius makes an elaborate rhetorical de- velopment of the commonplace "Souvent femme varie, / Bien fol est qui s'y fie." Its specific nature arises in its develop- ment with a commonplace corollary de- riving from Seneca Rhetor, "Muliebris garrulitas id solum celare potest quod nescit,"'9 developed later in the Livre de Melibge et de Dame Prudence, "la genglerie des femmes ne puet riens celler fors ce qu'elle ne scet," whence into Chaucer "the janglerie of wommen kan hyde thinges that they wot noght."20 It is to be redeveloped still later by Hotspur to his Lady Kate (Henry IV, Part I, Act II, scene 3). Genius, in concluding, excepts Nature from the general ranks of women in lines considered ironic. If irony there is, it stems not from Genius' saying what he does not believe but from the exploitation of the dual aspect of Nature, who here ap- pears, on the one hand, as the macrocos- mic force transcending human foibles and, on the other, as a microcosmic woman, subject to the characteristics of that ani- mal. Consensus has it that Jean de Meung possessed less "artistry" than Guillaume de Lorris; yet, in incarnating abstractions, Jean de Meung endows his permutated dynamisms with a human quality, indi- viduality, and completeness totally lack- ing in the less anthropomorphic creations of the original author. Similarly, Alain de Lille's Natura is always majestic and re- a18 Gunn, pp. 396-410, 493-95. o19 Annaeus Seneca, Oratorum et rhetorum, ed. Adolphus Kiessling (Leipzig, 1872), p. 209.

FRIEDMAN mote: Jean de Meung's Nature appears like any distraught and petulant woman. Only when an abstraction has been com- pletely humanized may the irony between res and signum be exploited humorously. Though he is speaking alone with Nature, a large part of Genius' discourse is ad- dressed to a masculine plural audience ("beau seigneur," 1. 16577). Has Genius or Jean de Meung forgotten himself and started to address the readers directly? This hardly seems the case, and, were it so, it would be exceptional, for elsewhere the author has scrupulously preserved the reality of his fictional setting. An alterna- tive point of view is that at this moment, Genius, the priest of Nature, is delivering a mock sermon, a fact of which he is aware: Cet sarmon devrait preeschier Quiconques avrait ome chier, Que tuit de fames se gardassent Si que jamais ne s'i fiassent [11. 16697-700]. Genius' other discourse to the troops of the Dieu d'amours has long been recog- nized as being in the nature of a crusading sermon. In both instances, the author has adapted the formal nature of Genius' sermocinatio to his profession. Just what view of women is really ex- pressed in the Rose lies outside the stated intent of this paper and has been ap- proached only so far as needed to support our contention that, in ascribing the ideas of the irate husband to the author, critics have blundered. The second aim was to examine to what degree the passage from which the original couplet was taken could be considered an example of "bour- geois realism." The term has been but badly defined; nevertheless, it is apparent that those who employ it definitely be- lieve that scenes so labeled are patterned after observed incidents of everyday middle-, or lower-class life or that the ac- tions and attitudes attributed to the char- acters are consonant with similar actions and attitudes of contemporary society of the classes indicated. It is from this point of view that we shall look at the irate hus- band's invective. This may be resolved into three ele- ments: (1) the wife spends too much time outside the house at dancing and attract- ing young men; (2) she is overfond of adornment, which has three subheadings: (a) such adornment is to incite lust in others, (b) it is of no service to the hus- band for whose benefit the wife claims to be doing it, (c) in so bedecking herself, she is presumptuously attempting to improve on God's handiwork (a section including a philosophical digressio on the merits of natural versus borrowed beauty); (3) the husband laments that he ever married and enumerates the evils of this state. In the evolution of the invective, our point 3 falls between points 1 and 2. This third point would seem amenable with extreme difficulty to "realism" considered as per- sonal observations of contemporary scenes, for it is taken wholesale from a passage attributed to Theophrastus, pre- served by Jerome in the Contra Jovinia- num, absorbed into the Policraticus of John of Salisbury, whence it was intro- duced into the Epistola Valerii ad Rufji- num de non ducenda uxore of Walter Map. The last-named seems to have been the immediate source of the Rose. Other por- tions of the Letter are put to use, as well as concorded with pertinent passages from Juvenal. For this portion, at least, the au- thor's model was transparently not some living bourgeois of Paris or Meung-sur- Loire, unless we assume that this class possessed an astonishing clerical, human- ist lore glibly on the tip of its tongue for use in domestic strife. The characteristics of this part of the invective come from the schoolroom, not the thirteenth-century</page><page sequence="9">"JEAN DE MEUNG," ANTIFEMINISM, AND "BOURGEOIS REALISM" 21 streets or bedrooms. In the other two portions we encounter two of the three accusations most fre- quently brought against women by medie- val, antifeminist, or "bourgeois realistic" texts: they spend too much time gadding about and are overfond of adornment. The missing member of the trinity is that they are overly fond of wine, a point to be considered later when we shall discover it intimately, but surprisingly, associated with the two other complaints. These charges have been taken by critics and his- torians as valid, accurate observations on the conduct of French medieval bourgeois women. A vivid part of this discussion is the scene in which the Jaloux upbraids his wife for being trop vilotiere, for spending too much time outside the house. When he goes to work, she dances and sings; and when he leaves town on business, she dresses up, saying it is for love of her hus- band. "Realistic" as the scene may be, we easily recognize the simple dramatization of several verses of Solomon on the strange woman whose foot is always out- side the house and who informs the youth that the goodman is away and will not re- turn before the appointed day.21 It has been changed only to conform with Euro- pean topography. Such is the source of inspiration, but what are the steps be- tween Proverbs and the discourse of the Jaloux? In the panegyric pronounced by Greg- ory Nazianzen at the funeral of his sister St. Gorgonia, in accord with the require- ments for funeral oratory set by the Sec- ond Sophistic, the father makes a rhetori- cal ecphrasis of the manner of life and vir- tues of the deceased, employing the op- posing passages of Solomon on the good and bad woman, and develops the antithe- sis in the presentation of his sister as a model for those who act otherwise.22 In the course of this, the wanton is as elaborately developed as the wise woman. The ecphra- sis contains the pertinent elements of the husband's tirade: the wanton who strays abroad to ensnare the souls of young men and who is overly fond of external adorn- ment, a presumptuous attempt to replace the craftsmanship of the divine artificer with that of worldly artisans. An important element in the Jaloux's reproach is the wife's fondness for danc- ing. Pursuing antique ecphrases of shame- less women, let us turn to a passage from St. Basil the Great, in a sermon delivered apparently around Easter: PvVaZKEs &amp;KXcaLTOL, EIrtXaGO/EVaL TOi 4p)0ov T70 OeOV, 70r ?rvpos ro) alWviov Karagpov7aaaTL . .. arosedlipevat ryv vytv T7S 80vUXElaS 70o Xpcrroi, I/baCat cLr Tv V Ke aXv 7r&amp; ?js ebTXrtodl'?1y KakX/Jltara, KaraCpovcaCLct ro70 OEoi, KaraC4poJTcjaLat TAjV cLy6yX WV abroi, KaTaVatLXuVTcaca t Irdlays ctppEVos 6iSt'Ews, copotaTL rdlS K6/aS, VbpovU(at rob XLTrja)S, Kal rohS rooIv ttla raLgovoat, 6~4aXtwi ALTXye', yEXWT7L iKKEXVU/VC, rphs bpX10tV K/tcavUeloat, laLeav ~v  dKoXaTav i4'EawcLs rporaCXOU- I.erva, v Toosrp rnp 7j rXEw / ap7rvpiot~ Xopobs ov0tr)LdTcL/EraL, EfpYaycO7pLov 7Tf otKElas abrVv dfXhoGh7s robV s t 7ltaOlioov rb6~rov 7revorl7yrat. l/.avav 63 7 yJ 70 oiS daKadprotL ?rooLv, ijv Av raZs 6pxdoEt K1areKpbrt7av, G&amp;arpov davrais veavlaiKwv 6XXov rEpLaTr7- a/tevat, TopflEs 6VY7wS KaL rapdxopot ravreXT s, /avLas ob5qElav b7rEpPokXfv dro- XElrovaat.23 21 Proverbs 7:5-23.

FRIEDMAN What appears in the works of the Cap- padocian fathers generally reappears in the works of St. Ambrose of Milan, and the latter has devoted a similar Latin pas- sage to the description of the singing, dancing ladies: Sed quid de uiris loquamur, quando etiam feminae, quas oportet sollicitiorem castitati sobrietatis adhibere custodiam, usque ad ebrietatem bibunt? deinde surgentes, quas etiam intra secreta domus uel audiri ab alienis non conuenit uel uideri, prodire in publicum non uelate capite, uultu procaci! apostolus mulieres tacere etiam in ecclesia iubet, domi uiros suos praecipit interrogare. illae in plateis inuerrecundos etiam uiris sub conspectu adu- lescentulorum intemperantium choros ducunt, iactantes comam, trahentes tunicas, scissae amictus, nudae lacertos, plaudentes manibus, saltantes pedibus, personantes uocibus, inri- tantes in se iuuenum libidines moto histrionico, petulanti oculo, dedecoroso ludibrio. spectat corona adulescentium et fit miserabile thea- trum. inter saltantium ruinas et spectantium lapsus caelum inpuro contaminatur aspectu, terra turpi saltatione polluitur, qua perob- scaenis saltatibus uerberatur.24 It must be confessed that the caroling women of the thirteenth century bear a strange resemblance to the corybants of the fourth. The passage from Ambrose brings us to the usual complaint of the drunkenness of medieval women. We may doubt whether this corresponds to a real- ity. The passage from St. Basil as well as that from St. Ambrose was directly on the subject of inebriation. An identical ecphrasis is found in St. Gregory of Nyssa's sermon Karc /LevOv7wv. If the rhe- torical ecphrases of the fourth century are the distant ancestors of the thirteenth- century descriptions of the wanton or the bawd, we would be quite surprised if the latter did not also bear the accusation of intoxication, since such was the original intent of these lines. Again we would be dealing with a literary tradition or con- vention rather than with a "realistic ob- servation" of contemporary life. In the works of the Cappadocians and St. Am- brose, these passages have been clearly recognized as rhetorical ecphrases con- structed under the influence of the Second Sophistic.25 They are part of a recurrent series which includes, in addition to in- ebriated women, inebriated men, tavern scenes, drunken orgies both elegant and vulgar, angry men, gamesters, usurers, and debtors. St. Jerome offers several ecphrases of wayward or unworthy men of God. It is interestingly suggestive that these same types-the bawd, the drunk- ard, the angry man, the gambler, the usu- rer, and the debtor, not to mention numerous scandalous monks and clergy- men--also turn up as the usual characters involved in medieval "bourgeois realism." The husband's second complaint dealt with adornment which served to excite lust in others, which was excused by the wife as designed to please her spouse, and which was censured as a blasphemous at- tempt to improve on the work of the Creator. Those themes, though touched upon in the passages cited, were already fully developed at a much earlier period in another work devoted entirely to this sub- ject, probably delivered as two or more sermons to the elegant ladies of Carthage or Alexandria in the second year of the third century by Tertullian.

Sister Mary Joseph Aloysius Buck ("Catholic University of American Patristic Studies," Vol. XIX [Washington, 1929]), p. 92. 25 In the correspondence of St. Basil and the pagan rhetorician Libanius, there is a pertinent exchange of favors. Having heard extolled, throughout Antioch, Libanius' declamation A~rKoXoo yi~ta1 XiXov yvva~r a aUvrYv r-po'aTrwXXTE--an unmistakable piece of rhetori- cal showmanship-Basil requested a copy and praised the author.

The arguments elaborated by Tertullian are precisely those made by the husband: (a) adornment is dangerous, for it rouses lust in others; (b) it is not indulged in to please the husband, since a Christian husband is not interested in this aspect of his wife as long as she is not downright slatternly; (c) it is an affront to God as an attempt to improve on his handiwork.26 Consequent- ly, like the preceding two sections, this portion of the husband's invective can hardly be given either the epithet "realis- tic" or the epithet "bourgeois." We are again dealing with a commonplace of the sermon or of moral, didactic literature. A casual glance at the indexes of Migne will testify to the vigor and longevity of this theme in Patristic writings. The husband may be a merchant (and this is perhaps fortuitously suggested by the text of Proverbs), yet he has certainly been through the schools, has read a large number of humanistic, moral, satirical sources, and is ultimately inspired by Boethius, Theophrastus, Tertullian, Juve- nal, and Jerome and Ambrose. The canny, knowledgeable Wife of Bath, victim of similar diatribes from her late husband, is more aware of their sources than modern Rose scholars: "Valerie, Theofraste, Seint Jerome, Tertulan, Criseppus, Trotula, Helowys, Parables of Salomon, Ovides Art" (11. 669-80). She is also conscious that if any epithet should be applied to them, far from being the adjective "realis- tic," it is "clerical": For trusteth wel, it is an impossible That any clerk wol speke good of wyves [11. 688-89]... no womman of no clerk is preysed. The clerk, whan he is oold, and may noght do Of Venus werkes worth his olde sho, Thanne sit he down, and writ in his dotage That wommen kan not kepe hir mariage [ll. 706-10]. Just as he is clerical in his sources, our Jaloux is clerical in his expression and knows the colors of rhetoric and how to compose an invective in the approved manner; in all respects, he shows a far greater reflection of the medieval schools than of an observation of contemporary life. Any measure of "realism" which may be found in the diatribe is of precisely that amount and kind to be found in any satiri- cal work of a literary moralist. This is the literary tradition to which this portion of the Roman de la rose belongs. It is a tribute to the genius of Jean de Meung in ethopoeia that his reapplication of these commonplaces to the stock characters of the medieval romance has been thought to originate in everyday life. In conclusion, we feel there are serious reasons to doubt that the husband's coup- let may be ascribed to Jean de Meung as his personal opinion with any sort of validity and to doubt that the passage from which this comment is taken is founded upon observation of contem- porary life or that it reflects the opinion of one social class as opposed to another. The common misconception is, on the other hand, homage to the remarkable comic talents of Jean de Meung and his extraordinary capacity for incarnating ab- stractions and revitalizing moral precepts in so personal a form that modern scholars have been deceived to "maken ernest of game."
