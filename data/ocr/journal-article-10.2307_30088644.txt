<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHRISTIAN FAITH AND PHILOSOPHICAL RESEARCH G19RARD VERBEKE Is philosophical research undertaken by a Christian as 'philosophical' as that of an unbeliever? Are the situations of the Christian and the unbeliever equivalent when they engage in strictly philosophical research? In other words, is not the situation of the unbeliever more favourable to such investigation? Will not the reflection of the infidel be more authentic, and thus truer, than that of the Christian who is in possession of other sources of information on the meaning of human existence? These are the principal questions I should like to treat of in this brief expose.* One of the major preoccupations of Martin Heidegger's thinking is to restore to human existence its character of authenticity, continuously menaced in the framework of modem civilization. Anonymous forces, mul- tiple and various, work upon man and make him constantly think and act as other people do, impersonally, without his recognizing for himself what should be done or believed. Truth above all takes on an impersonal physiog- nomy: very often it is not the result of personal discovery, a disclosure by ourselves, an awareness that might be considered an individual conquest. Our truths are often but borrowed truths, taken up mechanically and with- out any further reflection. The attitude of Heidegger towards the philosophy of the believer is in the same line of thinking; he considers authentic philosophical reflection impossible for the Christian: the Christian cannot devote himself to philosophical research in the full sense of the term. The fundamental ques- tion of any philosophy must be formulated like this: why does something exist rather than nothing? That this question-the most radical possible- can be posed in philosophy, no one will doubt: it embraces not simply one aspect of the real, but reality whole and entire of which it seeks the most radical explanation. To ask why there is something rather than nothing is to put the totality of the real in question in order to make it fully intelligible. Heidegger judges that the Christian cannot give himself over to such an investigation with a mind free of all prejudice. If research is to be serious, one must not be convinced he possesses the answer before starting the search. Now, the believer is convinced that he possesses the answer to the question. For him there is no doubt; God stands at the origin of the world; He has created everything by a free and gratuitous act. Consequently the Christian will never be able to pose this question radically and without *Text of a public lecture delivered at University College, Dublin, on 3 March 1966. STUDIES Summer 1966 I120</page><page sequence="2">prejudice: admitting in advance the practical consequences of his research he cannot deny his belief in order to devote himself to philosophical reflec- tion. As a result the only attitude he can adopt is that of acting as if, which is not an authentic approach. Heidegger even wonders to what extent the faith of a believer can be authentic if it presents itself as an unshakeable adhesion which can never be brought into question. To understand better the meaning of this problem, it is important to investigate further the precise and exact signification of the expression we have used already: 'to be a believer'. What does that mean in our modem world, taking into account the situation of the Christian in the context of contemporary life? However strange this may seem, the answer is that it means above all a 'restlessness'. The Christian does not simply accept life as it presents itself, without putting any interrogation marks for himself; his is not the belief of the narrow-minded hedonist, who tells himself that life is short and that one should enjoy it while he has the chance. Deep within himself the Christian is uneasy; he asks himself many questions; he thirsts for certitude, he desires to know the sense of life, he is not in- different about human destiny; his gaze is not satisfied with immediate horizons; he wants to lift himself beyond the immediate and to search out the ultimate values. Cardinal Suhard, speaking of the priest in the modem world, has stated that he is 'the minister of restlessness'. That is very true: the believer's attitude is the opposite of the superficial tranquillity of the man who is content with the present, living day by day, without worrying too much about the future. Is not the Christian's mind essentially eschatological, orientated to the final destiny of human life and continuously questioning itself in the light of truth penetrated with mystery? Cardinal Newman writes about the Christian thus: 'to be at ease, is to be unsafe' (Parochial and Plain Sermons, I, 4, I2 June 1825). The Christian is not at ease, he is not settled in his faith as in an unassailable fort, far from all the hostile forces that might assault the integrity of his faith. It would be false to think that the Christian is a kind of monolith, a man carved all in one piece, somebody who has given once for all his adherence to faith and who irremovably stays bound to a choice made at some time in the past. Such a concept resembles that described by Plato at the end of his Republic, in the myth of the Armenian Er. Each soul is called to make the choice of its kind of life. All the kinds of life are displayed before her; even if she is the last one to make her choice, no limitation will be imposed on her; once, how- ever, the choice has been made, there will be no going back and life will proceed according to that initial choice. That is not the Christian's situation. His faith is a vocation, a call of which he will assume the responsibility by an inchoative engagement, pro- Summer 1966 STUDIES 121</page><page sequence="3">gressively discovering the implications of his initial consent. As the implica- tions of his faith are revealed, he will have to take up new commitments, he will be confronted with the alternatives of assuming the consequences of his religious convictions or not. These implications after all are not merely theoretical; they are above all practical, and bring about different conduct in the concrete choices of life as between the Christian and others. Thus he will be confronted with life in the form of a struggle, which is at times rather difficult, if he is to protect the integrity of his faith. It is surely impossible to keep faith intact if it is not incarnated in the attitudes of life, even if those attitudes are difficult to maintain and ask sacrifices of us. Being continuously confronted with the practical demands of his faith, the Christian will ask himself very seriously whether he lives in truth. Is that an unauthentic question? Surely not. It is profoundly authentic, because it takes its source in the extremely difficult confrontation between the Christian faith and its practical demands in the world of to-day. Will the believer reject his creed? Many will; and those who keep their faith will do it with consciousness full, lucid and sometimes tragic, of the difficulties of the Christian life. St Augustine has also spoken about Christian restlessness: irrequietum est cor nostrum. This restlessness accompanies the Christian in all the steps of his life: it is in him as an internal wound that he does not manage to heal. The Christian does not have certitude purely and simply: he lives his Christian existence in a climate of insurmountable ambiguity. The believer would like to become fully what he is; but he never will be fully 'faithful'. Contemporary authors, such as Graham Greene and Gabriel Marcel, have called attention to this duality in the human psyche. A person who is faith- ful is not so once for all; a man is not fixed in a state of immutability by the fact of having given his word, in such manner that a decision once made automatically produces its effects during the rest of human life. Every commitment is penetrated with precariousness: hardly is it assented to when it is called in question anew. Being a kind of adventure, a leap into the unknown, it reveals its content progressively. Does not man have to assume implications he was unable to foresee? Without that, he will renounce the commitment he has taken on. That is the human condition and that is the believer's condition too. Faith is an engagement that is realized in time; one undertakes a future which at the start was hidden under the veil of mystery and now progressively reveals itself before our eyes. Time displays before us the implications of our commitments and offers us at each moment the possibility of a new choice. Being itself a flowing moment, it ceaselessly brings into question our previous commitments and continuously puts us in front of two alternatives. No moment is decisive to the extent that it STUDIES Summer 1966 122</page><page sequence="4">would fix us in a determined situation and would stop our 'becoming'. Each moment holds a promise for the future, it allows us to assume the past and to push on into the future; it also gives us the possibility of introducing a break in our life's orientation. Is it not true that, in modem life, unbelief surrounds us on every side? It is not only outside us, but within us, in that interior world which lies at the deepest part of us. If a man loses the faith and becomes an unbeliever where does he search for this unbelief, in order to introduce it into the tabernacle of his inner life? And how does he manage to banish the cer- tainty of faith from himself? There is no need to look for unbelief outside ourselves; it is to be found in ourselves, in a faith that is never total, that does not embrace our whole person, that does not inspire all our attitudes, that does not animate all our conduct. Each believer is a mission-land: he finds within himself vast expanses where the message of Christ has not yet penetrated, wide open spaces where the Gospel has not yet been preached. It follows that the faithful is also a missionary, who sets out for the con- quest of that inner world, which he desires to convert completely to Christ. The believer could say with Iago in Othello, 'I am not what I am': I am neither fully nor totally what I am, i.e., faithful. Indeed one could say about every Christian that he is belief and unbelief, certitude and incertitude, fidelity and infidelity, commitment and refusal. What is most perplexing in this situation is that, in the interior world, unbelief is not situated beside and outside faith as one geographical region beside another one: unbelief stands at the very heart of our adhesion to faith, it gnaws at our fidelity from the inside. Would not Rilke's comparison be helpful in this regard: Death is imbedded in the heart of life from the first moment of its growth? Is it then a congenital illness of faith to be constantly penetrated with unbelief and never to be completely itself? The answer is quite clear: it is not faith which is at issue, but man who professes faith; each fidelity is a victory on the flow of time. Isn't it a perpetual beginning? At each moment everything is to be taken up again in the uncertainty of the future. Every moment offers us the possibility of fidelity and infidelity, and these two eventualities find a resonance, an ally inside ourselves. But if the believer is so divided inside of himself, what should we say about the unbeliever? May we say that he completely is what he is? Is his unbelief not being gnawed at by a desire of certitude and fidelity? Without any doubt. And it is here the believer and unbeliever can meet, whether it be in philosophical research or in other fields. The believer is a man who, although bearing unbelief in the heart of his faith like an internal wound, continuously tries to assume the implications, impossible to foresee, of his adhesion to faith. The unbeliever is a man who, although bearing in the Summer Io66 STUDIES 123</page><page sequence="5">innermost part of himself a desire for certainty and fidelity, does not commit himself to adopt Christ's message, since he is not sufficiently convinced of its truth and value. These attitudes are quite different and the opinions which form their bases are in opposition to each other. Nevertheless on both sides there is a dualism that, in its divergence, shows a fundamental simi- larity. In our modem world the believer is continually confronted with the unbelief surrounding him. There was a time during which Europe was divided into two parts, geographically distinct: the Christian world and the non-Christian world. The borderlines between those two parts were not always the same, but the two worlds were clearly distinguished. This is so true that the presence of some non-Christians among Christians raised all kinds of problems: we need only recall the letter of the Duchess of Brabant to Thomas Aquinas concerning the Jews and especially the question about the identity badge the Jews had to wear. The Duchess wonders if she has to impose it to make the presence of the Jews readily recognizable by Chris- tians. Saint Thomas refers to the Lateran Council and answers affirmatively. The idea inspiring this regulation is sufficiently clear: the world of the infidels should be distinguished visibly from the Christian world, whether by geographical boundaries or by other perceptible marks. To-day we are quite removed from this use of barriers between the world of the faithful and that of the unbeliever: the latter are mingled in actual society in the same way as the faithful. We meet them in our towns and villages; they are with us in the trains and workshops; they live with us in the same buildings and sometimes even within the same family. Almost everybody has some un- believers among his friends and members of his family. Thus unbelief is not some exotic phenomenon to be found far from us in countries not yet civilized. It has established itself right in the heart of our own modem life. Each political society is confronted with the problem of the coexistence of believers and unbelievers and to-day it has grown quite impossible to base the structure of a state on Christian ideology without considering un- believers. The hermetic partition between the worlds of believers and infidels does not exist any longer. What are the consequences of this? The Christian can no longer avoid being confronted with the phenome- non of unbelief: this confrontation becomes particularly acute when we are dealing with the phenomenon of dechristianization. People of all ages and social conditions lose the faith and abandon all religious practice. In some cases the break with the faith will arouse a lot of popular atten- tion, but in most instances it will rather be a kind of progressive desertion. The fervour of religious practice will decline little by little and finally faith is lost because there isn't anything more to 'lose'. This whole phenomenon of unbelief and dechristianization is laid right before the eyes of to-day's STUDIES Summer 1966 124</page><page sequence="6">believer. Why shouldn't he do what so many others do? In the face of this human divergence in matters of religious opinions, we could easily get the impression that, after all, those differences do not really have so much im- portance. The essential point is to be loyal towards oneself and to build up an ideology adapted to one's own individuality. At any rate in the modern world a Christian will have to face the question whether he is not wrong to go on adhering to a kind of mediaeval mythology, which no longer corre- sponds to the critical mentality of modern science and the practical demands of to-day's world. For all these reasons we think that the believer's creed is much less monolithic than might be thought. And precisely because this faith is lived in a perpetual ambiguity, it is no obstacle to serious and authentic philo- sophical reflection. Will it be necessary to reject, at least provisionally, one's Christian convictions to enter upon philosophical research? Certainly not. It suffices that our faith should not be an option, made once in the past, which we refuse to reconsider. This attitude would be surely reprehensible from the point of view of faith. The believer's philosophical research will be serious in so far as the believer himself is serious, to the degree that he reflects on what he is doing, that he progressively discovers the implications of his former engagement, asking himself whether he lives in the truth. If his life-as Aristotle recommends in his Nicomachean Ethics-is dominated by the desire for truth, his philosophical research will not lack authenticity, amicus Plato, magis amica veritas. Philosophical research on the problem of God has long been dominated by Kantian agnosticism: one wondered if the critique of the German philosopher of the proofs for God's existence were justifiable. The essential question was to know if in fact all the evidence could be reduced in final analysis to an a priori reasoning, i.e., to the ontological argument. The critiques of modern agnosticism, on the contrary, are situated on another level: they are no longer concerned with the evidence of God's existence, but deal rather with what we might call the metaphysical physiognomy of God, or, in more traditional terms, the doctrine of God's attributes. The question is whether the habitual image of God is compatible with the density of human existence. If God is a necessary being and if he is the integral cause of everything that exists, how will man manage then to 'realize' something? Must we not then admit that the proper dimension of human existence is absorbed by the universal and necessary Cause? What remains of the liberty and contingency of the history that we are? The crux at this hour is the coexistence of the finite and the infinite; if God Summer 1966 STUDIES 125</page><page sequence="7">exists, can man then still exist? Or must man disappear to let God exist? It is true that the origin of the critiques we have just mentioned is to be found principally in rationalist philosophies and in the image of God we meet there. We may state however that, in general, the traditional image of God is put into question again at the present time: is the 'face' of God, as it is transmitted to us by religious and philosophical tradition, really authentic? Aren't there some characteristics or attributes of God which have been interpreted in too rationalistic a sense, so that one unconsciously sinks back again into a kind of universal determinism? Examining the characteristics proper to God, has sufficient account been taken of the repercussions of these divine attributes on the value of human existence? These are the questions being posed nowadays on the coexistence of the finite and the infinite. We read them in the writings of the French philosopher Maurice Merleau-Ponty, who also rises in revolt against some attributes traditionally ascribed to God. The interesting topic for us here is the conception of God as 'absolute knowledge', as an omniscient being. In a Christian milieu it is admitted as a matter of fact that God is not a kind of unconscious reality, a kind of primitive atom, but that He is a personal being, conscious of Himself and of the world, i.e., of the whole of finite beings that exist thanks to a free act of creation from the side of the infinite Being. In this view the knowledge of God is narrowly linked with the act of creation; God does not know the world because He finds it in his path, so to speak; the knowledge of the world is not the result of a meeting with the finite beings. If it were so, God would be passive and subject to growth. Is not that the reason why Aristotle ascribes to God the knowledge of himself only? As Aristotle's God is not the creator of the world and is only conceived as pure Act, he cannot be subject to growth. The Christian states that God knows everything that is, because He is the creative origin of all reality. According to the traditional doctrine there is no growing or progression in God's knowledge, because God is timeless, elevated above growth: God's knowledge would be unlimited, without growing and without progression, extended over all that is. Here comes Merleau-Ponty's criticism: if God is absolute Truth, if He knows everything from all eternity, has human research, be it in the field of science or of philosophy, any sense? What is such investigation good for, but discovering what is already known since the beginning of time? Man never uncovers anything for the first time; all he manages to realize is an increase in his own knowledge; he will never succeed in extending truth in the absolute sense. Human discoveries never realize a growth of truth in being. Men advance in their knowledge, but the sum total of intelligibility is no greater. We could remark that a discovery nevertheless keeps its value on the STUDIES Summer 1966 126</page><page sequence="8">level of men; there is always a growing of human knowledge, even when what has been discovered, has been known from eternity. This remark has its own value; but it does not solve the problem raised by Merleau-Ponty: we may say that human destiny is such that man can but discover what is already known. Where does this degradation of man originate? Does it not take its origin in the fact of admitting an omniscient God? Such a doctrine seems to put man irremediably into the class of those who repeat what has already been found before and creating the illusion that they have dis- covered it themselves. Ought we not recognize that in such perspective human action loses all its grandeur? Admitting the absolute knowledge of God, man is robbed of all his prerogatives such as freedom of creation and perpetual invention. M. Merleau-Ponty writes in Sens et non-sens: 'If God is, perfection is already realized within the world, it could not be increased, there is literally nothing to do'-'God is not entirely with us. Behind the incarnate Spirit remains the infinite gaze before which we are without any secret, but also without any freedom, any desire, any future, reduced to the condition of visible things.' The result is that philosophical research cannot have the same meaning for the believer and the unbeliever: whereas for the latter the investigation results in a real increase of truth, for the believer it can but present a far more modest value. Some will say that it loses its grandeur and originality, being no more than the 'recog- nition' of what has always been known. If that is true, the believer's philosophical research could not have the same degree of authenticity as that of the unbeliever. Consequently, it will be of great importance to examine closely Merleau-Ponty's doctrine on the coexistence of the finite and the infinite. Exactly where is the difficulty to be found? According to our author the absolute knowledge of God would render human research useless and needless. If God knows everything man does not have anything left to search for. Thus there would be a kind of rivalry, of competition between divine wisdom and human knowledge: if divine wisdom embraces every- thing, there is nothing left as a proper field for human investigation. Merleau-Ponty juxtaposes divine and human knowledge as two activities situated on the same level. It is just because they belong to the same order that a certain 'rivalry' between them is possible. So the whole problem centres around the question whether God's knowledge and man's are situated in the same order. For if both do not belong to the same order, Merleau-Ponty's criticism is automatically resolved. To answer in the line of thought of Thomas Aquinas, one could say that Merleau-Ponty's criticism does not sufficiently take into consideration the transcendence of every divine activity in relation to human activity. Summer 1966 STUDIES 127</page><page sequence="9">Is the problem of the coexistence of the finite and the infinite a false problem? Certainly not--on this condition that the infinite and the finite are not situated in the same order as juxtaposed realities and operating on the same level. In his commentary on Aristotle's Peri Hermeneias, Thomas Aquinas wonders if divine causality, which is integral, is not incompatible with human liberty. If God is the transcendental cause of all that is, He will be cause of my acts too. Thus I will not be the principle of the decisions that I take and of the acts I pose; everything will lead back to this unique and almighty cause that is God and my human existence will be but the unfolding of a drama in which I am not really the actor. Every 'contingency' will be lost and the history of the world will only be the performance of a play of which the text has been drawn up beforehand. Thomas Aquinas answers that this is not the real situation because divine causality is not situated on the same level as finite causality, that of man and the other beings in the world. The terms 'contingency' and 'necessity' take their origins in the relations of finite beings among themselves: if a cause is of the kind that necessarily produces its effect, it is necessary; if it does not do so necessarily it is con- tingent. To speak about contingency and necessity is consequently to point at the relations between one finite thing and another one. God's causality belongs to another order, it cannot express itself by means of categories which translate the relations of the finite beings amongst themselves. This causality is neither necessary nor contingent: it is transcendent with regard to the order of necessity and of contingency. God's causality is unique in its kind: it is a causality of creation and consequently an integral and trans- cendental causality. Let us apply this doctrine to the divine knowledge. Can it enter into competition with human wisdom, as if they were two activities juxtaposed on the same plan? If we agree, we inevitably fall into a kind of anthropo- morphism. We cannot conceive God's knowledge as the sum of all that men have known in the past, of all they know nowadays and all they will know in the future. We eventually could add all the things men might be able to know, but that they never will manage to discover. Taken in this way God's knowledge would be like a kind of extension of the human knowledges into the infinite. What everybody manages to know during his life will never- theless be quite limited; if we take all the knowledge of all mankind together, we shall have much more, but this knowledge will still be limited. Can we state that God's knowledge is constituted of an unlimited number of 'knowledges' as we find them in man? In that case God would be a kind of universal encyclopaedia, embracing all the particular knowledges to be found in other encyclopaedias and others not to be found there, or never to STUDIES Summer 1966 128</page><page sequence="10">be found. This is clearly an anthropomorphic conception of God's knowl- edge: the divine knowledge is situated in the line of an extrapolation of human knowledge. God's knowledge is absolute in the sense that it is the transcendent cause of every particular knowledge, it is a kind of a 'condition of possibility' of all these imperfect knowledges. Far from entering into rivalry with them, God's knowledge makes them possible. 'To make pos- sible' does not mean first to realize these particular types of knowledge in order to communicate them to man afterwards. That, too, would be anthropomorphism: God is not at the source of our cognitive life like a master who communicates his knowledge to us through instruction. God's knowledge is really transcendent in relation to us, i.e., He is the creative cause of our knowledge. If now we ask ourselves whether God's knowledge does not make our research and discoveries useless and vain, the answer is that God's knowl- edge is not a particular knowledge (even extrapolated into the infinite) side by side with another particular knowledge. There are some questions con- cerning God which we must set aside because they are anthropomorphic: to say that God knows from all time this or that discovery now made by us is quite an anthropomorphic way of presenting things. It would be more exact to say that God's knowledge is the transcendent cause of the discovery that has been realized. Is there any rivalry between this new discovery and God's 'preceding' knowledge? Certainly not; because God's knowledge is not situated on the level of temporal growth and constitutes the ultimate condition of possibility of each progress in human knowledge. What about the believer's philosophical research in this case? Can it be authentic? Our reply is affirmative. Although relying on divine knowledge as on its ultimate principle, it is still not the idle and useless repetition of a knowledge realized in God from all eternity. On the contrary it is an extremely serious research in order to discover the meaning of human existence and this research is finally possible thanks to the divine Truth, which does not take the place of human knowledge, because it is situated on a transcendent level. Let us take up again now the question we raised at the opening of this expos6. Does the adhesion to Christian faith make us less a philosopher or better capable of philosophical research? The answer may be disappointing. In our opinion the fact of being a believer makes us neither less nor more capable of authentic philosophical research. Not less capable, because the believer's philosophy does not lose its proper physiognomy; it remains what it is, a rational and radical investigation. Somebody might object that a believer will never profess an atheistic or materialistic philosophy. The answer would not be very difficult in our day: there are a lot of believers Summer 1966 STUDIES 129 2</page><page sequence="11">who have abandoned their faith and profess an atheistic and materialistic philosophy. The adhesion to faith is not given once for all: it is an option perpetually brought into question, a certainty penetrated by unrest: it is the very mark of a living and authentic faith. Does the adhesion to Christian faith make us more capable of philo- sophical research? We believe not: philosophy is a rational and autonomous discipline whose investigations have value only in the degree in which they are justified by reason. The believer is not more fit than an unbeliever to make penetrating analyses and to build up coherent syntheses: these realiza- tions depend immediately on the power of reflection in this or that person. Looking back into history we meet first-rank philosophers among believers as well as among unbelievers. The essential point of philosophical reflec- tion does not lie there: it is to be found in the original perspectives, the penetrating analysis and the coherent synthesis of human thinking.
