Such elements as diamonds, chevrons, dots, and sim- ple line forms can be traced in petroglyphs throughout California and the southwest. It is only in the char- acteristic manner of assembly and the circumstances under which they were made that the pictographs of this area become especially distinctive. The distinctive use of the geometric forms and the almost complete absence of many elements common to other petroglyph areas cause the designs of this region to stand out in a comparative study.

TRUE Pauma Valley, California August, 1953 PUBLICATIONS ON AMERICAN INDIAN PHYSICAL ANTHROPOLOGY 1952- 1953 In a previous communication (American Antiquity 19-3, January 1953, pp. 290-91), I noted significant items in this field during the period 1948-1951, with probably incomplete coverage for the first half of 1952. Additions to that bibliography and this one will be ap- preciated by the present writer and by the manage- ment. First of all, in supplementation for 1952, must be mentioned the valuable compilation, with year-by-year general trend statements (taken from the Handbook of Latin American Studies) and a subject index: T. D. Stewart, A Bibliography of Physical Anthropology in Latin America: 1937-1948, published by the Wenner- Gren Foundation, New York, 1952. The seventh Yearbook of Physical Anthropology, 1951 (edited by G. W. Lasker and W. L. Straus, Jr., pub- lished by the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthro- pological Research, Inc., 14 E. 71st Street, New York, 1953) cites papers of that year omitted in my above- mentioned list, including the following: R. E. Popham and W. D. Ball, "Eskimo crania from Southampton Is- land," Revue Canadienne de Biologie, 10: 435-42; Mar- shall T. Newman, "Skeletal material," in J. L. Cotter and J. M. Corbett, Archeology of the Bynum Mounds, Mississippi, National Park Service Archeological Re- search Series No. 1, Washington (G.P.O.), 1951; T. D. Stewart, "Antiquity of man in America demonstrated by the flourine test," Science 113:391-92 (concerning the Natchez pelvis); E. Davalos Hurtado, "La deforma- ci6n craneana entre los Tlatelolcas" (Escuela Nacional, Mexico, 99 pp.); five papers on dental details and mutilation or loss of teeth; one on blood pressure, a few on constitution and growth, and several on blood- groups. Two general papers of major importance on Arctic prehistory, including questions of racial type, are re- printed in this yearbook: Henry B. Collins' "Origin and antiquity of the Eskimo" (from the Smithsonian Institution Annual Report for 1950) and W. S. Laughlin and G. H. Marsh, "A new view of the history of the Aleutians" (from Arctic 4-2). Reprinted also, and of quite general interest, is a paper on "Stature, body- build, and tooth emergence in Aleutian Aleut children," by Stanley M. Garn and Coenraad F. A. Moorrees (from Child Development 22-4). In the September 1952 issue of the American Jour- nal of Physical Anthropology (Volume 10, No. 3), there are three papers on New World subjects: R. F. Heizer and S. F. Cook, "Fluorine and other chemical tests of some North American human and fossil bones"; W. A. Ritchie, "Paleopathological evidence suggesting pre- Columbian tuberculosis in New York state"; C. F. A. Moorrees and others, "Torus mandibularis, its occur- rence in Aleut children and its genetic determinants." In the December 1952 issue of AJPA (Volume 10, No. 72 [ 1, 1954</page><page sequence="2">FACTS AND COMMENTS 4) there are two: A. M. Pantin and P. C. Junqueira, "Blood groups of Brazilian Indians" and Kaaie Rodahl, "The body surface area of Eskimos" (methodology rather than general findings), and also a quotation from a paper by J. J. Graydon, "Blood groups and the Polyne- sians," Mankind 4-8, March 1952, which points out the relationship to America indicated by the Polynesian data (cf. M. Shapiro, "Blood groups and skin colour," Journal of Forensic Medicine 1-1, July-September 1953, p. 4). At the 21st meeting of the AAPA (in New York, March 1952), no papers on American Indian subjects were given. At the 22nd meeting (in Philadelphia in December 1952, jointly with the American Anthro- pological Association), there was one highly important general paper on "Adaptive change and race formation in the aboriginal New World," by Marshall T. New- man, published in expanded form in the American Anthropologist in 1953 as cited below. Among other papers appearing during 1952, that of perhaps the greatest interest to archaeologists is Georg K. Neumann, "Archeology and race in the American Indian," in the Cole Volume (Archeology of Eastern United States, ed. James B. Griffin, Chicago, 1952), a general review of racial types in North America with a new set of variety names; see the discussion by J. Lawrence Angel in the review of this volume in Ameri- can Antiquity (Volume XIX, No. 2, October 1953, pp. 172-73). The June 1952 issue (Volume 12, No. 5) of the mimeographed but permanently valuable Museum News of the W. H. Over Museum, University of South Dakota, summarizes the interesting and significant re- sults of Dr. Neumann's analysis of the Plains Indian skeletal collection at that institution, including Mandan, Yankton Sioux, Arikara, Ponca-Omaha, and Woodland (burial-mound) skulls. There is a paper on cranial in- juries among early Indians of California, by Cyril B. Courville, M.D., in the December 1952 issue of the Bulletin of the Los Angeles Neurological Society. Several of the papers from the XXIXth Interna- tional Congress of Americanists (held in New York in September 1949) published in the volume Indian Tribes of Aboriginal America (edited by Sol Tax; University of Chicago Press, 1952) are on topics of physical anthro- pology dealing with Mexico and South America: J. Comas, "Calculo de la talla de Mexicanos del Valle de Mexico a base de la longitud del femur" [pre-Spanish shorter than modern]: Antonio Santiana, "La mancha mongolica en los aborigines del Ecuador"; T. D. Mc- Cown, "Ancient man in South America"; Martin Gusinde, "El tipo antropol6gico del indio sudameri- cano"; and a few concerned entirely with modern popu- lations. Eskimo somatology is briefly discussed in Kaj Birket-Smith's survey, "Present status of the Eskimo problem," in the same volume, and there is also a summary by P. O. Pedersen of the findings of his "Anatomical studies of the East Greenland Eskimo den- tition." Several reports on skeletal material from archaeolog- ical excavations have appeared in 1952 and 1953, par- ticularly from the Southwest: George Ennis, "Human skeletal remains from Big Hawk Valley" (in Watson Smith, Excavations in Big Hawk Valley, Wupatki Na- tional Monument, Arizona, Museum of Northern Ari- zona Bulletin 24, Flagstaff, Arizona, 1952); R. E. and M. V. Gerald, "Human skeletal material from Quiburi" (in C. C. Di Peso, The Sobaipuri Indians of the upper San Pedro River Valley, southeastern Arizona, Amerind Foundation No. 6, Dragoon, Arizona, 1953); E. K. Reed, "Human skeletal material from Te-ewi" (in Salvage Archaeology in the Chama Valley, New Mexico, as- sembled by Fred Wendorf, School of American Re- search Monograph No. 17, Santa Fe, New Mexico, 1953). Similar studies from other areas include: Mar- shall T. Newman, "II. Indian skeletal remains from the Doering and Kobs sites, Addicks Reservoir, Texas," pp. 253-66, in Paper No. 4, "The Addicks Dam Site" (pp. 143-266), in River Basin Surveys Papers Nos. 1-6, Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 154, Washing- ton, D. C., 1953; and undoubtedly others. The short paper by R. F. Heizer and S. F. Cook on "Capay man, an ancient central California Indian burial," in UCAS-22 is concerned with dating only and does not describe the skeleton. In an ethnological mono- graph is found Marshall T. Newman, "Appendix 3. Anthropometry of . . . Northern Mato Grosso tribes," pp. 128-35, in: Kalervo Aberg, Indian Tribes of North- ern Mato Grosso, Brazil, Institute of Social Anthro- pology (Smithsonian Institution) Publication No. 15, Washington, 1953. The only paper on a New World subject in the March 1953 issue (Volume 11, No. 1) of the AJPA is a six-page report on "The blood groups of the Die- gueno Indians," by A. M. Pantin and Robert Kallsen. Of greater interest for American archaeologists is "A collaborative genetical survey in Ainu: Hidaka, island of Hokkaido," by R. T. Simmons, J. J. Graydon, N. M. Semple, and S. Kodama, which tends to distinguish the Ainu rather definitely, both from the Australians and particularly from the American Indians, and to indicate that genetic evidence militates against the hypothesis of a "proto-Caucasian" element common to all three peoples. In the June issue (AJPA 11-2), there is another paper on Eskimo fingerprints; in September (AJPA 11-3), one on blood-groups of the Blackfoot Indians; in December (AJPA 11-4), nothing on Ameri- can Indian anthropology. A recent article of the very greatest importance is: Marshall T. Newman, "The application of ecological rules to the racial anthropology of the aboriginal New World," American Anthropologist 55:311-27 (No. 3, August). Instead of establishing another set of more or less arbitrary types, Newman points out that the ranges in body, head, and face sizes and proportions among American Indians appear to be adaptive re- sponses to environment following roughly the well- known biological principles of less exposed skin sur- 73</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY face relative to body mass in cold climates, and vice versa, among other mammals generally; and can have developed since the original entry from Asia, say 15,000 years ago, of a single original group (cf. J. L. Giddings, "Ancient Bering Strait and population spread," in Selected Papers of the Alaskan Science Conference [of November 1950], Arctic Institute, Washington, 1952). Papers presented at the 1953 meeting of the Ameri- can Anthropological Association (at the University of Arizona, Tucson, December 28-30) included one on physical anthropology in the Southwest, by James N. Spuhler. The AAPA held no regular meeting during 1953. ERIK K. REED National Park Service Santa Fe, New Mexico January 1954 THE POSITION OF IPIUTAK IN ESKIMO CULTURE The reason for the following is an article by Henry B. Collins: "Radiocarbon Dating in the Arctic" which appeared in the January, 1953 issue of American Anti- quity. This is the third article in four years in which Collins comments on the interpretation of the Ipiutak culture advanced by Froelich Rainey and me in our publications on the excavations at Point Hope, Alaska, 1939-41 (Larsen and Rainey, 1948). Although critical regarding certain points in our theory on the develop- ment of Eskimo culture, his comments in the first two articles are on the whole objective and justifiable (Collins 1950a and 1951). His latest article, however, is written in a surprisingly sharp, polemic form which is entirely unprovoked and it contains statements which disclose that he has misunderstood certain important points in the Ipiutak report and misinterprets archae- ological evidence. My aim is not to begin a polemic be- cause experience shows that polemics are merely a waste of valuable time and print; they often foster ill feelings and seldom give positive results. However, for two reasons I feel that Collins' articles should not re- main unanswered. First I feel that the readers who are not familiar with Eskimo archaeology must be rather uncertain regarding the present status of this discipline and are entitled to a clarification. Second it is my hope that these lines may result in an adjustment of the divergencies in our conception of the development of Eskimo culture so that in the future we may pull in the same direction. Students in this particular field are so few and the problems have become so intricate that we need the combined efforts of all to get to the bottom of them. Of course I do not expect or even want Collins to accept our viewpoints outright, but in case of disagreement I do expect sound scientific documentation and not mere statements. In his article of 1951 we find, in a concentrated and urbane form, Collins' viewpoints regarding the Ipiutak report: "It is possible to accept the Asiatic affiliations of the Ipiutak culture, its relationship with modern Bering Sea and prehistoric South Alaskan and Dorset cultures, and its possible, but not yet proved, associa- tion with inland Eskimo culture as represented by the Nunatagmiut.* At the same time one may question the reality of the proposed dichotomy in Eskimo culture, the dissociation of Ipiutak and Old Bering Sea, the view that Ipiutak is a transplanted Asiatic culture, and the assumption that Ipiutak, strongly influenced as it was by late bronze- and iron-age cultures of Eurasia, was older than and ancestral to all other known forms of Eskimo culture." With the dichotomy of Eskimo cul- ture Collins refers to our demonstration of two layers of Eskimo culture at Point Hope, a paleo-Eskimo and a neo-Eskimo, and the distribution of these two layers. Actually we have not proposed a dichotomy but in our interpretation of the development of Eskimo culture we followed Steensby (1916) and Kaj Birket-Smith (1929) in their viewpoints regarding a stratification in Eskimo culture. Birket-Smith, whose theory is the more comprehensive, distinguishes between four culture layers of which the earliest, proto-Eskimo culture, gave rise to a paleo-Eskimo and this in turn to a neo-Eskimo and an eschato-Eskimo culture, each of them represent- ing an essentially different form of Eskimo culture. The cause of the development of a new culture may be a change in environment, contact with other peoples, or both. Though not all cultures had the same power of expansion there is hardly any part of the Eskimo area which has not been exposed to at least two cultural waves of which we may find archaeological or ethno- graphical evidence. A good example is the eastern Canadian Arctic which during the last thousand or more years has been the home of at least three distinct forms of Eskimo culture, the Dorset, the Thule, and the culture of the present-day central Eskimo. Since all agree that they occupied the region in that order we may as well use Birket-Smith's terminology and speak about an occupation by paleo-, neo-, and eschato-Eskimo, the latter meaning the latest. At the time of Birket- Smith's publication there was no archaeological evidence of the paleo-Eskimo culture (the Dorset culture was barely known) and it was not until the discovery of the Ipiutak culture that the idea of a stratification in Eskimo culture was taken up again[1].** At Point Hope we found, as I shall show presently, two different forms of Eskimo culture of which one was definitely more old-fashioned than the other, and because the latter was identical with Steensby's and Birket-Smith's neo- Eskimo culture it was not a far step to identify the former with their paleo-Eskimo culture. Contrary to Birket-Smith we considered at that time the Asiatic mainland to be the home of the proto-Eskimo while in the main we accepted his view on the origin of the culture of the central Eskimo. *In accordance with the pronunciation of the name we spelled it Nunatarmiut, the same spelling as used for instance by Knud Rasmussen (Ostermann 1952, p. 142). ** The bold face numerals in brackets key into Collins' reply which follows. 74 [ 1, 1954</page></plain_text>
