<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Contextualisation and typology of disc-headed and trapezoidal gravemarker forms in Scotland GEORGE THOMSON1 Summary Two distinctive small funerary artefact types, disc-headed and trapezoidal gravemarkers, are described. Both are uncommon in Scotland. Small disc-headed gravemarkers are distributed throughout the country but, with two exceptions, trapezoidal gravemarkers are restricted to the Shetland Islands. All known examples of these objects, including some not previously reported, are detailed and discussed in the context of similar artefacts in the rest of Britain and Europe. The current confusion in the use of names for these marker types and their variants is addressed and, through the construction of two separate typologies, a practical taxonomy is suggested. It is also suggested that both these gravemarker forms may represent examples of convergent cultural evolution. Keywords: disc-headed gravemarkers, trapezoidal gravemarkers, typology, cultural evolution Introduction Two small gravemarker forms from before the middle of the nineteenth century, here referred to as ‘discoid’ and ‘trapezoidal’, are relatively rare in Scotland (Thomson 2008a; Scott and Ritchie 2009). Although most, though not all of them have been reported before, they have not been considered in any detail in the context of similar markers in the rest of Britain, Ireland and the rest of Europe. Even before we proceed with any sort of contextualisation or typology, however, we run into semantic difficulties and ambiguous terminology. Disc- headed gravemarkers have been referred to variously as discoids (more so in continental Europe and the USA), wheel crosses and ring crosses, especially in Britain and Ireland (Thomson 2006a; Mytum and Evans 2003; Nijssen 1984). Perhaps because of their rarity, trapezoidal crosses have not been singled out as 1 Craignish, The Loaning, Waterbeck, Lockerbie DG11 3EY.

These problems are exacerbated by the occurrence of intermediate and transitional forms that do not fit neatly into any taxonomy. The two marker forms also raise the question of whether or not they were originally carved and erected as funerary artefacts or, in some cases, if they were some other sort of marker and later utilised for that purpose. It is important to note that we are here referring to small, short-shafted markers and not what are usually referred to in archaeology as free-standing ‘high’ crosses or cross slabs. However, we have a problem of determining when a cross is ‘short-shafted’ or ‘long-shafted’, although in practice the distinction is usually fairly clear cut. Broken heads from lost shafts, or those that have been deliberately shortened and reused, create obvious difficulties. This paper includes only small markers, less than one metre tall above ground level, and relates the known Scottish examples of both these marker forms, some previously unrecorded, to similar small markers elsewhere. These are considered to be of an entirely different group from larger cross artefacts, although it is recognised that sometimes there may have been a reciprocal influence on their design. Through an analysis of the variants of both discoid and trapezoidal markers and their related forms, and the construction of typologies of both basic types, a practical and largely unambiguous nomenclature is suggested. The intriguing question of the source of both these forms of head and shaft markers is addressed. More controversially, the idea that these artefacts may represent examples of convergent cultural evolution is discussed. Small Disc-Headed Markers There are at least thirty-two small discoid stones which are probably gravemarkers in Scotland, more depending upon definition, from both the medieval and Post- Reformation periods. There are eleven medieval markers from Bute (Fig 1), four from Ayrshire (Fig 2), two each from Aberdeenshire and Angus, and one each from Dumfriesshire, Lanarkshire, Perthshire and Roxburghshire. The diameter of most of the disc-heads of these early markers is relatively small, ranging </page> <page sequence="3"> GRAVEMARKER FORMS IN SCOTLAND 3 Fig 2 Early medieval discoid cross gravemarker, Museum of the Cumbraes, Millport, Ayrshire Fig 3 Discoid gravemarker, Lennel, Berwickshire, 1665 from 20–40 cm with a thickness of 8–10 cm, although the Collace and Saughtree markers are somewhat larger (see below). The artefact from St Modan’s Parish Church, Falkirk which was included in a previous paper (Thomson 2009a) is a sanctuary cross-head and is not a discoid gravemarker. From the seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries there are four discoid gravemarkers from Aberdeenshire, four from Lanarkshire and three from Berwickshire (Fig 3), although others are being discovered sporadically (Thomson 2009b). The discoid marker from Collace, Perthshire was reported and discussed in a previous issue of this journal (Thomson 2009a). The divergence of opinion on what is or what is not a discoid gravemarker makes it difficult to produce an accurate and unambiguous definition of the artefact. For example, the characteristic round head and shaft headstones in the Irish counties of Cavan, Fermanagh, Monaghan, and Tyrone (Fig 4) should be described as discoid as the circle is the most dominant feature and often there is no hint of a ring or cross other than very short projections at the sides and top of the disc, yet they are more often described as wheel crosses (Mytum and Evans </page> <page sequence="4"> 4 GEORGE THOMSON Fig 4 Discoid gravemarker, Donagh, Co. Fermanagh, Ireland, 1733 2003). Arguably, there is a continuum from discoid markers to other, possibly related, forms such as pierced ring crosses (Thomson 2009c). Further problems of definition are encountered when the discal part of the marker is ovoid or otherwise not exactly round, or when the top of the memorial is partially discoid or ‘necked’ (McNerney and Meyer 1994). Some gravemarkers are intermediate in form between ‘pure’ discoid, wheel and ring crosses and it often is a semantic argument whether they are one or the other. The occurrence of what probably are intermediate forms exemplifies the difficulty of trying to pigeonhole the discoid type of gravemarker. The term ‘discoid’ refers to the artefact’s morphology and has nothing whatever to do with its function. In simple terms, a discoid gravemarker is a funerary artefact formed of a distinct round head surmounted on a shaft. The shape (but not the relative width) of the shaft is, to a great extent, irrelevant as a primary diagnostic element. Most shafts are rectangular or trapezoidal. In Britain and Ireland small discoid gravemarkers almost invariably have a short shaft sunk directly into the ground, while non-funerary marker ‘crosses’ are usually considerably longer, often mounted on a socket base. The most important characteristic of a discoid marker is the predominance of a circular, or nearly circular apex. Vertical slab headstones on which a surface circular design is cut, such as some of the Scottish early Christian cross slabs and some early eighteenth-century headstones in Co. Fermanagh, are not discoid but may have a cultural affinity with discoid gravemarkers. A preliminary classification of discoid gravemarkers was made by the writer, based solely on morphology in an attempt to construct a convenient descriptive framework within which discoid types and related markers can be placed (Thomson 2008a). The classification included cross types, disc and shaft, necked, double discoid, ovoid and modern forms. Discoid gravemarkers are just one specific type of head and shaft memorial in which the circular element is dominant. This is important when we consider the cultural evolution of the artefact. A clarification of the variants of small discoid gravemarkers is needed so that any artefact of this form can be placed with reasonable confidence into one or other of a set of types. The typology of Group1 suggested here clarifies the </page> <page sequence="5"> GRAVEMARKER FORMS IN SCOTLAND 5 distinctions between the types, recognising that not every disc-headed gravemarker will fit neatly in any one type. A nomenclature for the major groups is also suggested. The typology (Fig 5) defines each type by four alphanumeric characters, two alphabetic and two numerical. The first character subdivides the markers into those without a cross (capital A) and those with a cross on either face (capital B). It takes no account of the style of cross or whether it is incised or in relief. Some designs on medieval markers are recorded as quatrefoils when, in fact, they are Maltese or St George’s crosses and the ‘quatrefoils’ are the counter shapes between the arms of the cross. The second character is determined by whether the disc head is not pierced (a), pierced with a roughly circular hole (b), or pierced with four triangular holes having right-angled armpits (c). The next character is numeric with 0 when there is no cross, 1 when the cross does not extend beyond the perimeter, 2 when the cross extends beyond the perimeter and 3 when the cross is indicated by projections beyond the disc only. Ba3 types are never pierced and appear to be restricted to Northern Ireland and the French Basque Region. When the top arm only extends beyond the perimeter it should be recorded as 3. The final digit represents the form of the shaft which can be straight (1), tapering in either direction (2), shouldered (3) or equal to the diameter of the marker head without necking (4). Markers of this latter form are neither discoid, wheel, nor ring crosses. When a character state is missing it should be recorded by a hyphen (-). A suggested nomenclature for the type groups is given. The known Scottish small disc-headed gravemarkers are detailed in table 1. Trapezoidal Headstones The trapezoidal gravemarker is a variant of the simple Greek or Latin stone cross with a distinctive wedge-shaped upper arm. It differs from the Maltese cross which has the side arms, and sometimes the shaft, tapering outwards, whereas the trapezoidal form has straight side arms. Twenty-nine trapezoidal gravemarkers have been found in Scotland. All but two from Kildrummy, and St Medan’s old church Aberdeenshire, are from the Shetland Islands. Fourteen are on Unst, eleven on Yell, two on Fetlar (Fig 6) and one on North Roe. All are probably early medieval (Fisher 2002). A medieval trapezoidal gravemarker has been found at Lowther, Cumbria, England (Thomson unpublished Fig 7) and five early eighteenth-century small trapezoidal headstones in Co. Londonderry, Ireland, three each at Desertmartin and Kilcronaghan (Thomson unpublished Fig 8). Some German trapezoidal Sühnekreuz and Mordsteine (Fig 9) may be gravemarkers, or reused as such (Azzola and Azzola 1972). Many richly decorated trapezoidal gravemarkers are found in Bulgaria, where they are called ‘key crosses’ (Fig 10), and Serbia (Dudic 1995). As with the previous typology, that for small stone crosses (Group 2) defines each type by four alphanumeric characters (Fig 11), two alphabetic and two numerical. The first character subdivides the markers into those with the side and top arms straight – not tapered outwards (capital A), those with side arms straight and top arm wedge-shaped – tapering outwards (capital B).

Discussion The typologies suggested here are entirely morphological and may form the basis for expanded systems.

It appears to be of a much earlier date than those on either side, possibly medieval. The discoid cross from Farnell, Angus (Fig 13) had been lost since it was reported by Eeles (1910). It was rediscovered by the writer in 2012 in the nearby grounds of the church manse. The diameter of the disc-head is 40.7 cm with a tapering thickness of 8.9–10.2 cm. Two unusual features of the artefact were noted by Eeles. The shaft is very narrow, only 10.2 cm wide, unlike that on any other British medieval discoid gravemarker. The shaft is cleanly carved with no evidence that a wider shaft has been broken. The raised cross is peculiarly offset from the vertical and horizontal, similar to the wayside cross at Trevalga, Cornwall (Langdon 1896). Eeles erroneously suggests that the Farnell marker is very similar </page> <page sequence="15"> GRAVEMARKER FORMS IN SCOTLAND 15 to a cross at Tullich, Aberdeenshire. The Tullich stone is a crudely-carved object much more like the other non-discoid cross-marked stones at that site. Its near circular form owes more to accident than design. Most of the discoid cross markers at St Blane’s, Bute are partially buried, some to half-way up the cross-head but all seven of the surviving stones were identified by the writer in 2012. One of the discoid markers from Kirkton, Great Cumbrae (number 9 type Ba13) is somewhat different from the others found at that site. One face of the disc head is carved with a raised Maltese cross. The other face is carved with a hexafoil which is repeated on the opposite face of the shaft. The shape and relative length of the decorated shaft, which is very unlike that from any other small medieval discoid marker, suggests that this stone may not be a gravemarker and may have served some architectural function. The Hoddom discoid cross (Group1 number 28 type Ba23) may well be funerary but evidence for this lies solely on the fact that it was excavated from the old churchyard. The wheel cross at Kirkconnel Lea, Dumfriesshire (Group1 number 29 type Bc13), is now a finial on the ruined Pre-Reformation church and is dated 1652. It is unusually small for a wheel cross and it is suggested that it is possibly a gravemarker (Thomson 2008b). The possibility that the discoid cross found during excavations at Glasgow Cathedral (Group1 number 35 type Ba2−) is funerary is based on its similar form to other small medieval discoid cross markers and its discovery in a place where burials were known to have taken place (Driscoll 1991). The projections on the disc head, described as ‘unusual ears’ by Driscoll, can be found occasionally on medieval discoid gravemarkers in the Languedoc (Bousquet 1980) and not uncommonly on those of the seventeenth-century in the French Basque Region (Colas and Thomson 2011). When the Sauchtree marker stone (Group1 number 37 type Ba1−) was first studied it was concluded that the artefact was probably the disc-head from a free-standing cross, similar to the one at Crosshall, Berwickshire. (Thomson 2008a Appendix III). However, it differs from the Crosshall cross in some important features, in particular the side carving. Also, the existence of Scheibenkreuz-gravestones in Germany (Azzola and Azolla 1972), which are almost identical in size and morphology, opens the possibility that the stone was, indeed, funerary. Circular or oval-shaped sculptural artefacts have been utilised as gravemarkers by various European and North American cultures from the Villanovan and Orientalizing Periods in Bologna, between the end of the ninth to the end of the sixth centuries BC, and the classical Roman period (Padovani 1977; Prades 1980; Richard 1980; Zubillaga 1991). Similar, often anthropomorphic, forms have also been found in Africa and South America. Many of the old world markers are Christian funerary memorials. These distinctive artefacts are particularly common in some parts of Europe, including the Languedoc district of southern France, especially the Hérault and the department of Aude, the Basque region of northern Spain, some of which are very large reaching 1.7 m in diameter, south-western France, Portugal, northern Germany and north-western Ireland. In recent years more are being found and reported. The writer discovered an unrecorded group of discoid markers, possibly late medieval in date, at Pirita, near Tallinn, Estonia as recently as 2014. The occurrence of pre-1800 discoid gravemarkers is much more </page> <page sequence="16"> 16 GEORGE THOMSON Fig 14 The recorded occurrence of discoid and discoid cross gravemarkers in Europe by country extensive than previously thought, although problems of definition impinge on the accuracy of any estimate of their distribution. Ucla records discoid gravemarkers from twenty-one countries in Europe, Asia, Africa and North America but his criteria for inclusion are rather liberal and erroneously maps many that are not funerary including the Cornish wayside crosses (Ucla 1993). Conversely, he suggests that there are few in Bulgaria where many important discoid gravemarkers are found (Fig 14). Dating the discoid gravemarkers is somewhat problematic but most fall into two main groups, medieval and Post-Reformation. In Scotland, as in much of Britain, the re-employment of non-funerary markers as later gravestones and the carving of later inscriptions on early stones are not as prevalent as in Cornwall and Germany. With a few notable exceptions, we can be fairly confident that those still located in graveyards mark the site of a burial. It is believed that the Languedoc memorials and many of the Spanish stones are from the early Middle Ages, probably ninth to twelfth centuries, with some of a later date (Bousquet 1980). The majority of German discoid gravemarkers are in Hessen and are mostly from the late fifteenth to the early sixteenth century, though some are much </page> <page sequence="17"> GRAVEMARKER FORMS IN SCOTLAND 17 later (Azzola and Azzola 1972). In Navarra, the Pyrénées Atlantique, and less commonly in other parts of northern Spain, there are similar gravestones of the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, with modern ‘revivals’ made since the 1970s. Several English discoid gravemarkers are thought to be Anglo-Norman or Anglo- Saxon, as at Beelsby, Camborne, North Rauceby and Westborough (Lincolnshire). Birtley, Heddon-on-the-Wall and Warden (Northumberland), Adel (Yorkshire) and Bakewell (Derbyshire), while others are likely to be medieval and include those at Ainstable and Dalston (Cumbria), Kildale and Whitby Abbey (Yorkshire), East Bridgford (Nottinghamshire), Grantham (Lincolnshire, now lost) and Hanslope (Buckinghamshire), Helpston, Horley, Lydden, Lythe and New Romney (Kent) and Whalley (Lancashire). The discoid stone at Darley Dale (Derbyshire) is generally considered to be Anglo-Norman but the sculptural form suggests a medieval date (Burgess 1963, Stocker 1986). Only one medieval artefact which is certainly a discoid gravemarker has been recorded from Ireland, on Devenish Island, county Fermanagh. Post-medieval discoid gravemarkers are common throughout Ulster (Thomson 2006b). They also have been recorded from many English counties including Cambridgeshire, Cumbria, Devon, Durham, Essex, Gloucestershire, Kent, Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Northumberland, Rutland, Surrey, West Midlands, and Yorkshire (Burgess 1963, Ucla 1993). Why discoid gravemarkers are far less common in Scotland is puzzling. Fig 15 shows the underlying geometry of the British and Northern Irish trapezoidal crosses, based on outline shape and reconstruction of damage and weathering. Even although there are few of these early medieval gravemarkers there is some evidence of local traditions in the style of the crosses in Shetland. In the case of all of the markers from North Roe and Yell the upper arm is short. On Unst it is a much longer, with the exception of Lundawick where the length of the upper arm varies. The distinctive characteristic of the upper arm has been largely overlooked, although Birkeli (1973) and Fisher (2010) briefly discuss the feature as found on free-standing crosses in south-west Norway and Neumann (2010) refers to the cross form in Germany as ‘cross with Maltese-head and square bars’. It is easy to dismiss this gravemarker form and attribute it, in many cases, to poor carving, or simply a modification of the Maltese or Latin cross. However, the occurrence of trapezoidal gravemarkers with a greatly exaggerated wedge- shaped upper arm, contemporary with the medieval Scottish examples, in England, Norway and Sweden, more than 150 sixteenth and seventeenth century Sühnekreuz and Mordsteine markers in Germany (mostly in Bayern and Sachsen), three in the Czech republic, one in Poland and five early eighteenth-century headstones in Co. Londonderry, Ireland, suggests that this character is more than just accidental or decorative. The English similarly-shaped stone fragment is in the north transept of Lowther Church, Cumbria. The lower shaft is missing and it may have been the top of a free-standing cross rather than a funerary memorial. The remaining artefact measures 37 cm high by 13 cm thick. It is cut from local red sandstone and is believed to be eleventh century in date (Bailey and Cramp 1998). Richly decorated trapezoidal gravemarkers are found in Bulgaria, often alongside discoids, in which case the trapezoidal marker represents the deceased man and the discoid the woman. Although very few are dated, most are from </page> <page sequence="18"> 18 GEORGE THOMSON Fig 15 The underlying geometry of small trapezoidal gravemarkers from Great Britain and Northern Ireland the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries (Enchev-Vidju 1994). It is believed that others could be of a considerable age, as memorial art in Bulgaria originates in the seventh century (Liubenova 1996). Similar wooden gravemarkers in pine and </page> <page sequence="19"> GRAVEMARKER FORMS IN SCOTLAND 19 other common timbers survived until at least the early part of the twentieth century. There is no evidence of the occurrence of this gravemarker form in neighbouring Romania, Macedonia, Greece or Turkey. It is unlikely that the western European gravemarkers are anthropomorphic. The German Sühnekreuze and Mordsteine were erected to commemorate murders or other traumatic events although, like some of the Scandinavian markers, many were appropriated for funerary purposes. The several stone crosses of a similar form from south-west Norway, and a few from Sweden, which are frequently cited as having some connection with the Shetland artefacts (Fisher 2005; 2010), are significantly larger than those from Germany or Shetland. It is thought that most of the Scandinavian trapezoidal crosses are area markers, sometimes reused as gravestones (Birkeli 1973). Further evidence that the trapezoidal part of the artefact is the most significant part can be inferred from the considerable reduction in length of the side arms of several of the Shetland gravestones. Also, the upper arm of the Irish and many German trapezoidal markers is greatly enlarged. Even if the trapezoidal gravemarker form is a modification of the Maltese cross, there must have been some reason for this focus on the upper arm by the carvers. Convergent Cultural Evolution? There have been no studies that suggest the possible existence of convergent evolution of burial practices, yet mummification was undertaken in Egypt around 3600 BC and in Chile about 3000 BC, having developed quite independently. Marking a burial with a stone, practised in widely separated cultures, is another example. How do we come to have similar artefacts in places that were unconnected in both time and space? Are the two gravemarker forms described here possible instances of convergent cultural evolution? There is little doubt that gravemarkers of the discoid form emerged independently, but not contemporaneously, in Europe, South America and Africa. Within Europe there is no evidence of a contemporary cultural influence between the discoid gravemarker carvers in south-western Europe (Portugal, the Basque Region and the Languedoc) and north-western Europe (Britain, Ireland, Germany and Scandinavia) that would have led to the emergence of discoid artefacts. Nor is there any trace of a cultural link between them and those in Bulgaria. Cultural pressures and creative impulses that lay behind the concept of the discoid gravemarker form may well have been as diverse as the multiplicity of cultures within which they are found. Four principal reasons for the adoption of the discoid gravemarker form have been proposed and supported by various authors. These are anthropomorphism, as a modification of the Christian cross, sun worship/astral representation and a cultural empathy with geometry, especially the circle (Frankowski 1920; Etchehandy 1989; Aussibal 1993). The ringed cross has a quite different origin. Redknap and Lewis (2007) suggest it may have evolved from the laurel crown that often surrounds the cross on early Continental sarcophagi but it is generally accepted that it has pre-Christian origins being similar to the so-called ‘sun cross’ of Bronze Age Europe (Eliade 1961). The nature of the material from which these artefacts were made could not have significantly influenced their form as it ranges from soft sandstones to the hardest granites. </page> <page sequence="20"> 20 GEORGE THOMSON There are instances where we can have confidence that some discoid gravemarkers are anthropomorphic. The anthropomorphic balbals of Central Asia could well represent an embryonic stage that, in the appropriate cultural environment, could have led to the abstract discoid form (Belli 2003). Some of the sixteenth- to eighteenth-century wooden krikštai gravemarkers from Lithuania are discoid in form and are certainly anthropomorphic. Some discoid gravemarkers from Halatte, Oise (France) are incised with the human figure, with the head on the discal part of the marker. As an implementation of the Bulgarian commemorative practice of using the trapezoidal gravestone to mark the burial of a male and the discoid for the female couples were often marked with the two forms joined as a single memorial. Classical discoid markers and many of those in the Basque region are decorated with abstract representations of the sun or stars reflecting the importance of these astral bodies to those by or to whom they were erected. While this may have influenced the shape of the stones, it is doubtful if it was the primary reason for their morphology. Geometry brings order to visual complexity. It helps to organise visual thought and describe much of what we see around us. In terms of design, basic geometric shapes such as the rectangle and circle provide the functional basis of many of the things we utilise today. Many artefacts have a basic circular form. The practicality of the shape led to the wheel and determines the form of most coins and ceramics, for example. The human aspiration for order and the simplicity of the circular form was, perhaps, one of the determining factors, possibly the most important, in the origin of the discoid marker. It is probable that each of the theories of their origin has some validity and all may have been instrumental, with different emphasis at different times in different cultures. The coincidental similarity between the nineteenth-century small gravemarkers at Temple Balsall, Warwickshire and medieval discoid markers in the Languedoc has been reported and discussed (Thomson 2007). Explaining the independent occurrence of the trapezoidal form of gravemarker is far more problematic. The historical connections between Shetland and Norway in early medieval times is well known (Fisher 2002; 2005; 2010). However, in the most extreme examples, there is yet no evidence of a historical or cultural connection between Norway and the southern half of Germany or between post- medieval Ireland and Bulgaria. Although the similar forms of the distinctive headstones from Shetland, Germany, Bulgaria and County Londonderry may be coincidental, perhaps a clue lies on a rather unimposing Latin-inscribed stone fragment in St Teilo’s Church, Merthyr Mawr, Wales. The reverse is carved with a design similar to the trapezoidal gravemarkers. Both Macalister (1928) and Thomas (1976) tentatively suggested that the design may represent a Greek omega. Could it be that trapezoidal gravemarkers in Bulgaria and Ireland have this common inspirational source? The use of omega in a Christian context certainly would be appropriate for a gravemarker. The Bulgarian trapezoidal and discoid headstones are not anthropomorphic but the symbolism of their shape and what this represents certainly is. Evidence of the same or similar influences on the designs of these Shetland, Irish, German and Bulgarian gravemarkers is rather weak. Discoid gravemarkers with parallel cross-arms below the disc head, as found in Bulgaria and eighteenth- and nineteenth-century gravemarkers in the USA (McNerney and </page> <page sequence="21"> GRAVEMARKER FORMS IN SCOTLAND 21 Meyer 1994), may have a similar origin to trapezoidal gravemarkers, representing the Greek omega, although no author has suggested this before. Convergent evolution is a phenomenon that has been known and studied in the biological sciences for some considerable time. Only relatively recently has its possible existence in both ancient and modern cultures been debated within academic circles. Convergent evolution is defined as the acquisition of the same, or similar traits in unrelated lineages. Although there have been strong arguments presented against the concept of convergent cultural evolution (Pinker 1997; Bloch 2000; Tëmkin and Eldredge 2007; Land 2008), others have supported the theory, including some notable academics from a variety of disciplines (Sutton 1982; Dawkins 1996; Dennett 1995; Dobzhansky et al. 1977; Hull 1982; Huxley 1995; Popper 1997; Skinner 1981). In support of the argument Mesoudi et al. (2006) suggest that history is likely to be littered with examples of independently evolved solutions to common problems, where cultural lineages from distant, yet similar environments have evolved similar features. They cite the acquisition of similar forms in unrelated lineages, including the independent evolution of writing by the Sumerians around 3000 BC, the Chinese around 1300 BC and the Mexican Indians around 600 BC, ostensibly in response to a need for stocktaking. Caldwell and Millen (2008) give examples of convergent evolution across separate populations towards similar artefact designs. The archaeological term ‘independent invention’ is a related phenomenon. However, artefacts such as those discussed here are usually a product of a developmental process. In the possible case that discoid and trapezoidal gravemarkers are other examples, the term ‘convergent cultural evolution’ is preferred.
