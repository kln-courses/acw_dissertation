GENERAL PROJECTS AND SURVEYS 'Iraq al-Amir and the Wadi al-Kufrayn Survey. Chang-ho C. Ji, La Sierra University, and Jong-Keun Lee, Korean Samyook University, report: During the summer of 1998, the "Iraq al-Amir project returned to the region of Wadi as-Sir and the Wadi al-Kufrayn to conduct a regional survey. Two previous seasons focused on the area within a 5-km radius of "Iraq al-Amir and the cave complex near the village of "Iraq al-Amir. The 1998 season was de- signed to examine the existence of ancient settlements and road systems connecting the Jordan Valley with "Iraq al-Amir and the Transjordan plateau, particu- larly along the Wadi al-Kufrayn and the Wadi Jariya. Attention was also given to settlements in the hilly, arid region between the Wadi al-Kufrayn and the Wadi ash-Shu'ayb to investigate the association of this region with "Iraq al-Amir and the settlements in the southern Jordan Valley. Surface finds indicate that the survey area wit- nessed settlement intensification in the Chalcolithic/ Early Bronze I (EB I), Iron II, Hellenistic, and Byzan- tine periods. The survey team recorded 88 archaeo- logical sites that represented a wide range of periods yet revealed a heavy concentration of Chalcolithic/ EB I, Iron II, Hellenistic, and Byzantine sites with dis- tinct locational patterns. Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Age sites are concentrated along the Wadi al-Kufrayn and in the Umm Hadder region north of the Wadi al-Kufrayn dam (fig. 2). Two of these sites, about 2 km north of the dam, are distinguished by a large number of broadroom houses and extensive wall lines. Architectural and ceramic materials from the sites are similar to those from Tulaylat al-Ghassul. A striking pattern was noted in the location of Iron II and Hellenistic sites near the Wadi al-Kufrayn and the Wadi Jariya. Most of these sites are either watchtower-like structures or fortified villages built within a short distance of one another, and they were often built in locales with no immediate relation to agriculture. This may indicate the existence of major Iron II-Hellenistic road networks along the Wadi al- Kufrayn and the Wadi Jariya to link "Iraq al-Amir with the southern Jordan Valley. Some additional con- temporaneous sites were noted on top of high ridges or hills that command excellent views over the Wadi Jariya valley and the Umm Hadder re- gion. Thus, the settlement patterns in the Iron II and Hellenistic periods also appear to have been influenced by military and defensive considerations. Some important Iron II and Hellenistic sites are Khirbat as-Suwan, Khirbat al-Medina, Rujm al-Klal, and Rujm Umm Hadder. In contrast, Byzantine sites were spread over the entire surveyed area, indicating that the Byzantine settlement pattern was not determined by any partic- ular factors. Most Byzantine sites appear to have been farmstead or watchtower-like sites associated with dry farming and animal herding. A surprising discovery of the 1998 season was that Islamic sites are almost absent in the region between the Wadi al- Kufrayn and the Wadi ash-Shu'ayb. Sites from the EB II-III, Middle Bronze (MB), Late Bronze (LB), and Iron I periods are also sparse. Several scattered Palaeolithic sites were identified along the Wadi Jariya and the Wadi al-Kufrayn. At least one more season of archaeological fieldwork will be needed to complete the survey. Umm Qais, hinterland survey. Nadine Riedl, DEI Amman and Deutsches Archioligisches Institut Ber- lin, reports: In October 1998 a survey financed by the German Archaeological Institute was conducted on the 'Ard al-'Ala, a triangular plateau west of Gadara (Umm Qais) in northern Jordan.

Khirbat as-Suwan, the al-Kufrayn Dam lake, and the Umm Hadder region been examined only briefly by G. Schumacher (North- ern "Ajlun. "Within the Decapolis" [London 1890]) and S. Mittmann (Beitrdge zur Siedlungs- und Territorialge- schichte des nordlichen Ostjordanlandes [Wiesbaden 1970] 25-26). The objectives of the 1998 survey were to study the history of land use in the chora of Gadara more intensively, to assess the relationship between city and hinterland, and to obtain information about pre-Hellenistic human activity in the area. To cover the area as thoroughly as possible, sample squares were established within the borders of agricultural fields, as these were easy to locate on aerial photographs. The entire area was walked, and pottery was collected from sites as well as from 37 of the 116 fields. Two narrow roads built of basalt stones were found along the northern and southern edges of the pla- teau. Judged to be secondary roads by their size and construction, they connected Gadara with Tiberias to the northwest and Skythopolis to the southwest. A group of milestones stood on the northern road one Roman mile from the city, one with an inscription in- dicating that the road was constructed or repaired during the reign of Caracalla. Since most stones have been cleared from the cul- tivated fields on the plateau, only a few buildings are still preserved. The survey identified two structures located on commanding positions: one overlooks the Yarmuk Valley and dates to the Roman period; another, probably of Hellenistic origin, commands an excellent view south over the Wadi el-'Arab and west over the Jordan Valley. These buildings may be fortified farmsteads characteristic of the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Recent land use has covered or damaged many earlier agricultural installations, but two large wine- presses were discovered near the road and the city. One lay on the site of a former Roman cemetery, dated to the Late Roman or, more likely, the Byzan- tine period. The graves were reused as collecting ba- sins and a tomb chamber was used as a storeroom. The size of the two winepresses indicates wine pro- duction on a very large scale. Limestone was available within the city limits, but basalt had to be quarried outside the city, on the pla- teau. Traces of basalt quarrying were found on vari- ous sites along the southern edge of the plateau, and a large basalt quarry was identified on the western slope, about 3 km from the city. Pottery collected from the surface indicates that the quarry was in use during the Roman and Byzantine periods. The survey yielded little pre-Hellenistic pottery on the plateau itself, possibly due to the thick layer of soil covering the fields. An EB IV cemetery was docu- mented at the western slope of the plateau. It con- sisted of more than 100 shaft tombs, each with a single chamber cut into the limestone bedrock. Nearby, the site of Khirbet et-Tabaq was recorded. The extant basalt walls date to a Mameluk settle- ment, but ceramic evidence indicates a settlement dating to the Hellenistic period. Some Bronze Age sherds recovered here may link this site with the EB IV cemetery.</page><page sequence="4">488 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M. BIKAI [AJA 103 Geoarchaeology of alluvial deposits and soils in the Northern Moab. Carlos Cordova, Oklahoma State University, reports: Geomorphological research was carried out dur- ing the 1998 archaeological survey of Wadi ath- Thamad, directed by P.M.M. Daviau (Wilfrid Laurier University) and C. Foley (University of Saskatchewan), and of Wadi al-Walla, supervised by J. Long (Lub- bock Christian University). The study revealed inter- esting associations between site locations and the distribution of alluvial deposits and soils, and it sug- gested several possibilities for the study of Late Qua- ternary environments in the Northern Moab. Locations of prehistoric sites show an association with the height and age of alluvial terraces: the higher the terrace, the older the site. Recognition of this pattern allowed investigators to identify sites of simi- lar age by searching for alluvial terraces of correla- tive age. A close examination of deposits on cut banks revealed some prehistoric occupations that had been buried by successive layers of alluvium (fig. 3). Postoccupational erosion, which has been in- tense through millennia, has also affected site visibil- ity, and prehistoric occupations are more likely to be found in areas where the soil cover has been pre- served from erosion. While prehistoric sites are closely associated with alluvial deposits, historic sites are associated more with features of erosion and colluvial deposits (the deposition of a heterogeneous mixture of sediment and rocks downslope). This association suggests that there was more alluvial deposition in the wadis dur- ing the Late Pleistocene (prior to 8,000 B.C.) and greater stream erosion during most of the Holocene. The geomorphological context of most Epipalaeo- lithic, Neolithic, and Chalcolithic sites suggests that these occupations coincide with the peak of major alluvial dynamics, as indicated by evidence of rapid sedimentation, fluctuations of stream erosion, and deposition of coarse alluvial material at the end of the cycle. Alluvial deposits dated to later periods, however, are more suggestive of equilibrium in the alluvial dynamics, probably due to landscape stabil- ity, as is seen in some deposits near Khirbet Iskander. Later on, environmental conditions reverted to slope instability; most Nabataean and Roman sites are located in contexts that show a rapid removal of soil and rocks from hillslopes. Pending the establishment of absolute dates, the alluvial deposits studied were given a relative chro- nology based on soil profile development and correl- ative cultural material. Northern Moab has a com- plexity of soils which correspond to the different rocks and the variety of ecological units, ranging Fig. 3. Wadi ath-Thamad. Cut bank exposure with layers of alluvial deposits, buried soil horizons, and a prehistoric occupation surface (indicated). from areas of Mediterranean climate to drier areas toward the east. The structure of soil profiles, the distribution of soil types, and associated geological formations on the uplands indicate that at one time there was more potential arable land in the plateau, even extending into the margins of the desert. Evi- dence suggests that soils in the uplands may have been later eroded and washed down into the val- leys, where now they make up the alluvial and collu- vial deposits. The observations made during the survey raised a number of questions. Is environmental change due to climatic fluctuations, human disturbance, or both? What is the role of agricultural intensification in the acceleration or control of soil erosion in the pla- teaus? How is ancient soil erosion reflected in allu- vial deposits and modern soils? What is the role of vegetation in the process of environmental change? A study is proposed in order to answer these ques- tions and establish a geochronology of soil develop- ment and alluvial environments in relation to the chronology of cultural development. The proposed research comprises specific objectives, such as the study of soil structure and the analysis of alluvial pol-</page><page sequence="5">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 489 Fig. 4. Uniza-Shobak Road Survey, site no. 2 len, which will provide information about vegetation change and palaeoagricultural activities. Uniza-Shobak Road Archaeological Survey. Mo- hammad Waheeb and Yara Doleh, DAJ, report: The Ministry of Public Works and Housing (MPWH) plans construction work on the 58-km road between Shobak and Wadi Musa. The DAJ conducted a pre- liminary survey in 1998 to assess the impact of the project on archaeological sites in the area. This pro- cedure is becoming standard for all major construc- tion projects financed by the MPWH, allowing the DAJ to conduct archaeological investigations to pro- tect important cultural heritage sites from destruc- tion. The procedure is part of a cooperation agree- ment signed in 1994 by the MPWH and the DAJ through the mediation of the Cultural Resources Management project (CRM). In addition to assessing the importance of archae- ological sites along the road alignment, the survey will investigate the evolution of settlements and site selection in the area, study architectural remains, es- pecially the early camps and watchtowers, and inves- tigate the relationship between land use and water resources. The study is to be conducted in four steps: 1) analysis of aerial photos to identify visible sites; 2) intensive archaeological survey and assessment of the occupational periods at identified sites; 3) soundings at selected sites to establish a stratigraphical record; and 4) limited excavation at various selected sites, followed by a comprehensive excavation to rescue threatened sites. In May 1998 all the archaeological sites and mon- uments located along the road alignment were sur- veyed and registered (fig. 4). Several new sites were identified, and previously identified sites were also studied. The team mapped structures and collected artifacts. The survey determined that no site discov- ered during the survey need be destroyed by the road project, and most of the sites are not directly threatened by construction. Some will require archaeo- logical work and excavation before the road construc- tion begins. Protection measures are recommended for all the sites listed in the preliminary report. A site assessment was conducted and sites were ranked according to significance. While this ranking was made only on the basis of surface data, it serves to characterize the area and to suggest that the risk of the discovery of a major find is relatively low. The survey identified sites from a broad range of periods from the Palaeolithic to the Byzantine. Ten sites are directly threatened by the project and are consid- ered of medium or low significance. Protection mea- sures are recommended for all of these sites, and each should be subject to individual study. In general these studies will include further intensive surveys as well as limited and full excavations. PREHISTORIC Wadi al-Hasa. D.I. Olszewski, Bishop Museum, Honolulu, and N.R. Coinman, Iowa State University, report: The Eastern Hasa Late Pleistocene Project con- ducted its second field season from May toJuly 1998. Research focused on hunter-gatherer settlement pat- terns and technology associated with the lake/marsh ecology of the Wadi al-Hasa from about 40,000 to 11,000 B.P. Fieldwork included test excavations at one new site and renewed excavations at three sites. Testing at Thalab al-Buhayra identified Early to Middle Upper Palaeolithic (Ahmarian) occupations. This large open site is situated on a series of ancient shorelines of Pleistocene Lake Hasa. Of special inter-</page><page sequence="6">490 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M. BIKAI [AJA 103 est is the presence of Ksar Akil scrapers and other tools with microserration. Fossilized large mammal bones, teeth, and lithic artifacts are eroding out from well-defined horizontal strata. Subsurface test- ing occurred in three areas of the site: loci C, E, and J. Locus C produced a lithic assemblage dominated by endscrapers associated with primary butchering activities, possibly with the extraction of bone mar- row. Two hearths and el-Wad points were uncovered at locus E. Locus J yielded a dense cluster of lithics, including large numbers of primary, secondary, and tertiary flakes and blades representing a single knap- ping episode. Excavations were renewed at Tor Sadaf, an Early Upper Palaeolithic (transitional and Ahmarian) rock shelter. The lower levels are characterized by a tran- sitional technology, evolving from the local Mouste- rian, in which radial Mousterian cores are replaced by single platform cores. This assemblage contrasts markedly with the Early Ahmarian in the technology, typology, and overall dimensions of the debitage. In the upper levels, attributable to the Early Ahmarian and separated stratigraphically from the lower levels by a cobble layer, el-Wad points are the most distinc- tive retouched tools found. The faunal assemblage is limited and only moderately well preserved, consist- ing almost exclusively of medium-sized mammals in which the bone fragments are thin walled, dense, and smooth. Renewed excavations at Tor Sageer, an Early Epi- palaeolithic rock shelter, revealed a large area used repeatedly for hearths. At least two occupation hori- zons were identified: one associated with the use of the hearth area, and the second characterized by red- ocher staining in the deposits immediately above bedrock. Spatial differences in activities were recon- firmed, with an emphasis on core reduction in the eastern section of the rock shelter. The lithic assem- blage includes La Mouillah points, arched-backed bladelets, backed and truncated bladelets, rare Qalkhan points, and microburins. There is a large, well-preserved faunal assemblage. The collapsed rock shelter at Yutil al-Hasa (fig. 5) was also subject to renewed excavation. Upper Palaeo- lithic occupation occurs in area A, Early Epipalaeo- lithic in area C, and Late Epipalaeolithic in area D. In area A, the most common tool type is the Ouchtata bladelet. In addition to two hearths identi- fied in 1984, two probable occupation surfaces were recorded. The upper surface is associated with one of the hearths and is characterized by abundant bone and lithics. The lower surface has abundant trimming flakes and shatter. In area C the lithic assemblage in- cludes La Mouillah points, backed and truncated Fig. 5. Wadi al-Hasa. Excavations in Yutil al-Hasa of the Upper Palaeolithic rockshelter, area A. bladelets, arched-backed bladelets, and microburins. Of some interest is the lithic assemblage from the low- est levels, which contains Ouchtata and Dufour blade- lets, types generally considered typical of the Upper Palaeolithic. These may indicate that area C has two distinct chronological periods. Area D produced lithics of the Early Natufian phase including Helwan lunates, Helwan retouched bladelets, microburins, and abruptly backed lunates. A small pit feature was uncovered just above bedrock. Ghwair I. Alan H. Simmons, University of Nevada at Las Vegas, and Mohammad Najjar, DAJ, report: Ghwair I, a spectacularly preserved Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) village in the Wadi Feinan, was originally investigated in the early 1990s by M. Najjar as part of the German Archaeometallurgical Investi- gation Project. In 1996 limited test excavations were undertaken, and a more substantial excavation was completed during the winter of 1997-1998. A major goal is to investigate Neolithic "core/pe- riphery" relationships to determine whether Ghwair I, located in the periphery of the Neolithic world, functioned as a frontier outpost with minimal ameni- ties, or whether it was a small but elite center. The project will compare small settlements, such as Ghwair I, with larger Neolithic centers, such as 'Ain Ghazal, Wadi Shu'eib, and Basta. Another objective is to de- termine, through palaeoenvironmental and palaeo- ecological reconstruction, whether the occupants of Ghwair I contributed to environmental degradation, as has been suggested for larger Neolithic core set- tlements, such as 'Ain Ghazal. Ghwair I covers approximately 1.5 acres on a hill- slope 290-320 masl with a commanding view of Wadi Ghwair/Feinan. The well-preserved architec-</page><page sequence="7">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 491 ture is certainly the most spectacular aspect of the site; walls with windows and doorways are preserved to a height of more than 2 m. Excavations have indi- cated a depth of over 4 m in some areas. During the summer of 1998, the co-principal investigators and a small team led by J. Cole completed a brief season using ground-penetrating radar. While final results are not yet available, field indications confirm the site's considerable depth. Architecture at Ghwair I is relatively typical of the PPNB but exhibits some unique characteristics. In 1996, a large room containing several niches was partially excavated and completed during the 1997- 1998 season. This is an unusually shaped structure, roughly square but with a jog in its western wall. The southern wall contains at least three niches; the west- ern wall has a blocked-in doorway, a small niche, a plastered bench, and a windowlike feature. Prelimi- nary indications suggest that at least two of the niches may be vents. This room is an unusually com- plex structure for the PPNB period and may have had a special function. Other interesting structural features were revealed when several balks in one area of the site were removed. The earliest building phase seems to have included a very large room, ap- proximately 10 m on each side. Also revealed was a series of thick parallel walls that may have served as retaining walls for water control. The abundant artifacts recovered include a large assemblage (more than 30,000 pieces) of chipped- stone material typical of the PPNB. Although analy- sis is still underway, the material includes a large quantity of projectile points, a wide array of ground stone, and the usual small finds associated with Neolithic villages-spindle whorls, beads made of bone, stone, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic fig- urines, and marine shells. Significantly, a small num- ber of potsherds has also been recovered, suggesting either a later Pottery Neolithic component or early experimentation with ceramic manufacture. Faunal material, under analysis by P. Croft, has re- vealed a variety of economic forms including caprines, cattle, pig, a small carnivore, and one or more bird species. Palaeobotanical material is being studied by R. Neef, who has identified charcoal, barley, emmer wheat, pea, and pistachio. D. Rhode is examining soil samples for phytoliths. Finally, R. Mandel con- ducted a preliminary geomorphological analysis of the site to place Ghwair I within a wider geological context. Thus far, six radiocarbon determinations are available for the site and are stratigraphically consistent, indicating an early Middle PPNB place- ment. A PPNA-like point recovered in 1996 appar- ently dates to a PPNB context; it was initially thought to indicate an earlier occupation, but this remains unverified until more radiocarbon determinations are available. Of interest is a small PPNA site within view of Ghwair I. These renewed investigations at Ghwair I indicate that the site is far more complex than previously be- lieved. It is unlikely that the settlement was a simple outpost; rather it clearly functioned as an important early Neolithic settlement. 'Ain Ghazal. Gary Rollefson, Whitman College, and Zeidan Kafafi, Yarmouk University, report: The 1998 excavation season at 'Ain Ghazal lasted for four weeks in June and July 1998, with L. Quintero as acting field director. The principal goal was to probe several caves in the upper part of the East Field to determine if they had been used by the Neolithic residents of Ain Ghazal. The short season was disappointing in the lack of evidence for Neolithic use of the caves, but other excavations at the site were satisfyingly productive. Caves. Excavations were conducted in four caves (caves 1, 3, 4, and 5); cave 2 proved to be too shallow to have been used. Cave 3 was a small tubular open- ing, and bedrock was reached soon after work be- gan. Although the tube continued into the hillside in two directions, it was so small that human use in any age seemed inconceivable. Numerous faunal re- mains were recovered from the upper deposits, but all appeared to be modern. Cave 4 was used as a burial site for an adult and a child. Pottery found with the burial has not yet been dated. Bedrock was reached quickly, and the opening did not penetrate into the hillside for more than 1 m. Cave 5 produced numerous burials-at least six were recovered just from the 1.5 X 3 m area sampled-but the associated pottery indicates that all clearly postdate the Neolithic period, although an exact date remains to be determined. Much animal bone was mixed with the human remains, and a bronze bodkin was recovered just above bedrock. Much of the cave remains to be explored, but this will not be an ob- jective of the Neolithic 'Ain Ghazal project. Cave 1 was relatively deep, with more than 1 m of deposits, but because of the experiences in caves 3 and 4, the excavation was suspended once bedrock was approached. There was a wall 1 m in height at the entrance of cave 1 and, based on the excavation of cave 5, it is possible that the cave was used for post- Neolithic burials. It is not clear how deeply cave 1 penetrates into the hillside. Other excavations. Square G-29 did not reveal the suspected extension of the house in Square F-28, ex- posed in 1996. Instead, a Late PPNB courtyard and wall was exposed, as well as an associated LPPNB cul-</page><page sequence="8">492 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M. BIKAI [AJA 103 tic arrangement of stones indicating a small outdoor shrine, perhaps associated with family worship. The arrangement consisted of a small circular stone sur- rounded by six others (the number of seven stones was also found in the two temples in the East Field in 1995 and 1996), all of which were located in a semi- circle of four standing stones about 40 cm high. A deep probe south of the courtyard wall revealed more than 3 m of deposits down to MPPNB levels; several caches of charcoal should provide a series of 14C dates. These samples will greatly improve our understanding of the chronology of the East Field, and the cultic installation adds invaluable informa- tion to the ritual practices observed by the settle- ment's residents. Small probes were sunk at the northern and southern ends of the western wall of a room cleared in 1996 in square F-28. These probes demonstrated that the house originally extended at least one more room to the west, although the extent cannot be de- termined, since this part of the structure was destroyed by a sewer line, and perhaps even earlier during the construction of the Hejaz railway. A large wall in squares N-46/47 and 0-46/67 proved to be a terrace retaining wall. The wall is ir- regular and seems to have been built in at least three phases, all of them likely dating to the LPPNB. The entire wall is ca. 1 m high and is slightly battered, leaning into the hillside. No associated architecture was found, but a series of courtyard surfaces were sampled. Bawwab al-Ghazal. Philip J. Wilke and Leslie A. Quintero, University of California, Riverside, and Gary O. Rollefson, Whitman College, report: Surface collection of 6,000 m2 and initial excava- tions were conducted at Bawwab al-Ghazal on the Azraq Wetland Reserve of eastern Jordan. The site occupies a low mound on a former slough in a marsh environment between the springs of Azraq Oasis and Azraq Lake. The site was first used as a hunting camp during the Early Natufian period, and excavation of one discrete Natufian locus yielded a bladelet industry, about 40 lunates, many bladelet tools, and bone fragments. Most of the occupation, however, dates to the LPPNB. Research at Bawwab al-Ghazal focused on a search for the origins of nomadic pastoralism. The site was selected because surface artifacts were of forms com- mon in Neolithic townsites of early farmers and herders in the Jordanian highlands. In a localized disturbance were bones of early sheep or goats, nei- ther of which was native to the lowland desert/ steppe. Apparent goat horn cores from excavated LPPNB deposits are considered evidence that these animals were brought down to the desert from their natural ranges in the highlands to the west. Genetic studies are planned to compare the early herd ani- mal population with that recovered from Neolithic sites in the highlands and may indicate the home ter- ritory of the people who camped at Bawwab al-Ghazal. Studies of dental annuli of sheep/goats and analysis of bird bones, many species of which were migrants between Eurasia and Africa, will be undertaken to determine the season(s) of site use. Hunting rather than farming seems to have been the major economic strategy of the inhabitants living in the marsh zone of Bawwab al-Ghazal. Thousands of bone fragments recovered in the course of excava- tion await firm identification, but they clearly indi- cate that large mammals, probably aurochs (ancestral wild cattle), onagers or other equids, and especially gazelles, were hunted regularly, as were water birds of many species. Constructions appear on the surface in several ar- eas as partly exposed stone alignments oriented per- pendicular to prevailing winds. One excavated align- ment was two tiers high and linear in configuration, suggesting anchorage for reed huts or tents. The production of shell and stone beads and other ornaments was an important industry. Most of the shells are tentatively identified as those of a lo- cally available aquatic gastropod, but a few are of ma- rine origin. Many disk-shaped beads are of white, pink, and red stone, but there is limited evidence of their local production. More important was on-site production of beads and pendants of many forms from a soft, pale green stone known locally as "Dabba marble." The material occurs as lumps in limestone exposures on the site. It was flaked, ground to form, and then drilled. Many delicate bead drills and many failed or aborted beads were recovered. Beads of the same green stone appear at the Neolithic site of 'Ain Ghazal near Amman in the same time period. Among formed lithic artifacts, bifaces-many made on seam flint-account for more than half of the assemblage, and perforators and drills, includ- ing bead drills made on burin spalls, are also abun- dant. Hundreds of weapon points were recovered, as well as 17 obsidian pressure-blade fragments that ap- pear to be of Anatolian origin. Thus, Bawwab al-Ghazal gives evidence for use of the marsh zone around the former Azraq Lake for some 3,000 years. It also provides initial data sup- porting the development of nomadic pastoralism during the Neolithic of the Levant. Esh-Shallaf.

Esh-Shallaf. Remains of a semicircular structure with remnants of a floor just above the scale. A three-week campaign was undertaken at esh- Shallaf in northernJordan in October 1998. The site was discovered by S. Mittmann (Tfibingen Univer- sity, Germany) when excavating at nearby Khirbet ez- Zeraqon in 1984-1994 and surveying the region ad- jacent to the EBA city. Judging from the pottery then collected from the surface of a terrace in Wadi Shel- lale, it appeared that the site was a small village or hamlet dating to the Pottery Neolithic A (PNA, 5500-4500 B.C.). The 1998 campaign was under- taken to further study the site, since only a few sites of that period have been investigated in northern Jordan to date (e.g., Abu Thawaab, Ain er-Rahub). South of the so-called Roman bridge, a test trench (Ti) measuring 27 X 1.5 m was opened to investi- gate the nature of possible architectural remains. Another test trench (T2), 10 X 1.5 m, was dug north of the Roman bridge. In trench T2, the only remains revealed were those of a small wall. Work in the larger trench proved more productive, and five addi- tional squares of 5 X 5 m and two squares of 5 x 2.50 m were opened adjacent to trench T1. The excavated walls are rather fragmentary, and in most squares only the lowermost course survives. Structures at esh-Shallaf were apparently built on semicircular or oval foundations (fig. 6). The upper walls may have been built of wood, reeds, or tentlike material. Most of the excavated pottery clearly re- sembles that of the Yarmoukian period, with sherds bearing the characteristic herringbone incisions. A red polished ware and larger quantities of a rough ware (storage jars and cooking pots) were also found. A very small quantity of animal bones was re- covered and remains to be analyzed. Fifteen soil samples were taken during the excavation, mainly from loci 17 and 19 in the deep sounding of Ti, to be analyzed byJ. Meadows (La Trobe University, Aus- tralia). Most of the plant remains in these samples were badly fragmented, but it was possible to identify lentil, hulled barley, and a glume wheat, probably emmer. The most common seeds were those of As- tragalus, a typical steppe species, which may have been used for fuel. The absence of any wood charcoal also suggests that the landscape in the Neolithic pe- riod may have been as barren as it is today. It is hoped that further research on the site will follow in 1999 to clarify the extension of the architectural remains. Teleilat Ghassul. Stephen J. Bourke, University of Sydney, reports: The third season of excavations at Teleilat Ghassul took place between 4 January and 8 February 1997. The main goals were to continue a number of small probes through the archaeological sequence into sterile layers, to recover further archaeobotanical and archaeozoological material, to expand explora- tion into the eastern area of the site, and to intensify investigation of the latest phases of occupation. In area A, two trenches were opened to probe the Chalcolithic sequence. In 1994 and 1995, two small probes sampled the entire 6-m sequence for botani- cal, zoological, ceramic, and lithic remains. In 1997 a new 5 X 5 m trench (AXII) was placed immediately north of J.B. Hennessy's trench AIII to sample a wider horizon of the latest Chalcolithic deposits. Trench AXI, first opened in 1994, was expanded to sample Middle and Late Chalcolithic deposits. By</page><page sequence="10">494 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M. BIKAI [AJA 103 season's end, both probes had revealed several phases of architecture, and much botanical/zoological and ceramic/lithic material was recovered. Finds were con- fined to spindle whorls, recut pottery disks, bone, and stone tools. The trench opened in 1995 in area E was ex- tended to the north and west to sample deposits against both sanctuary A and sanctuary B exterior walls. The pathway from the altar discovered in 1995 was found to lead directly to the sanctuary A steps. Good plaster surfaces linked the altar with the ear- lier phases of sanctuary B and confirmed that sanctu- aries A, B, and the altar shared a common history of reconstruction. New probes revealed that the te- menos wall had been eroded away along its eastern and southern sides. A new 10 X 5 m trench was opened 15 m north of sanctuary B to investigate the concentration of storage-jar sherds and stone-lined pits visible on the surface. Many small fire pits, traces of mudbrick walls, and several stone-lined storage pits were revealed. This area seems to have been part of a large domestic unit and contained botanical/ zoological remains different from those within the sanctuary area. Finds in both trenches were confined to fragmented bone, flint and groundstone tools, and two broken ceramic cups. All major occupation dates to the Late Chalcolithic period (ca. 3900-3600 B.C.). Excavations in trench GII continued the 1.5 X 1.5 m probe through the PBI Tulayl III sequence begun in 1995. Sterile layers were reached some 5.7 m be- low the surface. Two further meters of Early and Middle Chalcolithic (PBI Ghassul I-II?) deposits were excavated, and extensive botanical/zoological samples were recovered. The northern third of the original trench GII was redesignated trench GIII in 1997 to explore a wider horizon of the very latest phases of occupation. Two full phases of architecture were uncovered, although the first was badly dis- turbed by many small pits and the second by extensive earthquake damage. Occupation dates to the very lat- est phase of the site. Finds include an almost com- plete cornet cup, several figurine fragments, and a number of bone tools. GII deposits date to 4700- 4200 B.C., and GIII deposits to 3800-3600 B.C. The 18 X 7 m longhouse in area H, first probed in 1995, was more fully investigated in 1997. New trenches were placed over the south-facing court- yard and the northern living room to recover mate- rial from the surfaces, as a significant quantity ap- peared to be in situ. Several fine stone tools and a fragmentary pottery vessel, very roughly made, were recovered off the floors of the northern room, al- though much of the southern courtyard was cut by pits and modern disturbances. The full extent of the longhouse was uncovered, and associated ceramic and lithic finds date to the Late Chalcolithic period. In area N, the probe begun in 1995 was continued and two further meters of Early and Middle Chal- colithic (ca. 4300-3900 B.C.) deposits were ex- plored. A large, well-preserved mudbrick wall was uncovered at the base of the sounding, implying fur- ther significant deposits below, which in turn sug- gests that the depth and intensity of occupation on the northern margins of the central tell (Tulayl I and II) was greater than first thought. Finds were limited to fragmented pottery vessels, spindle whorls, recut pottery disks, flint, and bone tools. Area Q was newly instituted in 1997 to explore the latest Chalcolithic deposits in the eastern region of the site. Two 5 X 5 m trenches were positioned ap- proximately 150 m to the east of Hennessy's area A. In trench QI, a longhouse complex and associated storage facilities were uncovered, while QII, immedi- ately to the south, revealed a significantly more dis- turbed stratigraphy, which nonetheless included at least one main structural phase featuring large plaster- lined bins filled with lentils. The highlight of excava- tions here was the discovery in the northeast of the complex of a small room associated with the burials of at least two children, where a siltstone stamp seal, a he- matite macehead, a mother-of-pearl necklace, and two miniature ceramic vessels (a bowl and ladle) were re- covered. The finds require further study, but it would appear that this room served a nondomestic, perhaps funerary, function. Work in 1998 balanced continued probing of the deeply buried layers with a more intensive examina- tion of the latest phase of the Chalcolithic across the site. Finds in the latest Chalcolithic trenches suggest a significant amount of in situ material, heightening the impression of a hasty or unplanned abandon- ment. Finds from the deep probes emphasize the size of the early settlement and the longevity of occu- pation across the entire settled area. BRONZE AGE AND IRON AGE Pella. Stephen Bourke and Kate da Costa, Univer- sity of Sydney, report: The 18th season of excavations at Pella took place in November and December 1996, and the 19th in February and March 1997, to study the archaeologi- cal sequence in seven major areas of the site. Trench XXXIID: Chalcolithic platform. Excavations in 1995 uncovered some 4 m of a 3-m-wide mudbrick and stone platform at the base of the area XXXII se- quence. The overall width and shallow foundations of the structure, without parallel at Pella, seemed to suggest something other than a simple (if very large)</page><page sequence="11">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 495 wall. Excavations were expanded in 1996. Several phases of vestigial EB II (ca. 2700 B.C.) architecture and one very fine EB I (ca. 3200 B.C.) building were uncovered before the level of the Chalcolithic (ca. 3700 B.C.) platform was reached. The structure con- tinued 1 m east of the previous limit of excavation, making 5 m in total. At its eastern end, a staircase led up to the center of a raised mudbrick and stone plat- form. A pebble and gravel roadway ran along the south side of the platform, and a far more substan- tial stone pavement ran along the inner northern face. A curved stone wall over 5 m long ran up to the southern edge of the staircase and seems to delimit an open courtyard to the east of the stairs. In 1997, the area east and south of the platform was ex- plored. Large amounts of a burnt sifted wheat prod- uct were recovered from burnt courtyard surfaces. It seems likely that the platform relates to the large wheat silos excavated in 1992-1994 some 4 m east of the small area of the platform currently exposed. It is likely that the platform continues west to form part of a large storage complex. Ceramics from the silos and the structure are of an identical Late Chal- colithic (ca. 4000 B.C.) date. To the south of the plat- form, excavations uncovered a number of small, ear- lier Chalcolithic (ca. 4700 B.C.) and Late Neolithic (ca. 5200 B.C.) pits cut through patches of Late Neolithic occupational debris. Trench XXVIIIC: Western fortifications in the Middle Bronze Age. Excavations in trench XXVIIIC, where a tower and city wall were discovered in 1995, were ex- panded in 1996 to reveal a massive solid mudbrick tower, some 8 X 7 m in plan. Two lines of mud- brick walls, each about 20 m long, were traced east and west of the tower. Five distinct phases of MBA (ca. 1800 B.C.) material were associated with the structure, and the extensive constructional fill depos- its confirmed the early MB II date for the walls. Pres- ervation is exceptional, with the 5-m-thick walls often preserved up to a height of 4 m. Clearly delineated mudbrick courses, techniques of construction, and rebuilding phases will provide vital data on building methods and the possible existence of distinct re- gional schools of construction. In 1997, a 5 X 3 m area west of the tower and north of the western wall was taken down to sterile soil. A small patch of EB IB walling (ca. 2900 B.C.), two large irregular pits of EB I date, and several small pits of Late Chalcolithic date (ca. 4400 B.C.) were uncovered. Trench XXXIF: MBA funerary deposits and Neo-EBA occupational deposits. Excavations in 1995 uncov- ered two phases of a large, well-constructed mud- brick building with two bins lined and sealed with plaster. From the bins, a series of complete ceramic funnels, flasks, small bowls, and a unique gypsum bowl were recovered. In 1996, the remainder of the building and both bins were completely excavated. Additional large and small funnels, flasks, and bowls were recovered. An Egyptian alabaster kohl pot, several red and black burnished juglets, and a number of carinated bowls and painted jugs were added to the repertoire of what is likely a decom- missioned funerary libation assemblage. Best paral- lels for the material suggest a date in the MB/LB period, around 1600 B.C. In 1997, some 3 m of de- posits beneath the funerary deposits were explored, revealing two fragmentary phases of EB I domestic architecture, patches of at least three phases of Chalcolithic period occupation, and at the base of the sequence, a number of plaster-lined pits and sec- tions of two Late Neolithic (ca. 5400-5000 B.C.) semisubterranean roundhouses. Sterile deposits were reached in the western half of the trench at the end of the season. Trenches XXXIIG-L: Late Bronze/Iron Age Migdol temple. Excavations in 1994 and 1995 uncovered some 27 m of the southeastern corner of a monu- mental building on the southern edge of the main mound. Work in 1996 concentrated on delimiting the western end of the structure and exploring its in- terior. The western return of the building was discov- ered 8 m west of previous excavation limits, making the structure 35 m long and more than 20 m wide. The assemblage recovered from surfaces within the structure suggest that the building is a monumental Migdol temple. Finds include four faience cylinder seals, two pieces of Egyptianizing ivory inlay, several pieces of wooden furniture inlay, a faience pyxis lid, a bronze spearhead, numerous glass, faience, carne- lian, and lapis lazuli beads, and an asymmetrical ce- ramic bowl of a type commonly recovered from LB and Iron Age temples in the region. Excavations in 1997 concentrated on the interior of the building and were carried down to the primary stone-flagged floor of the southwestern corner. The major discov- ery was that of a large, fragmented conical ceramic cult stand probably dating to the LB/Early Iron pe- riod (ca. 1150 B.C.). If related to the temple func- tion, the iconography suggests the worship of a male deity, indicated by the prominent male figure with spear (Baal Hammon?), as well as a female (As- tarte?), indicated by date palm groves, a garlanded altar, and grazing caprines. The plan of the temple has parallels with Shechem, Megiddo, and Tell Hayyat. The Pella temple was probably constructed during the LB IB period (ca. 1450 B.C.), rebuilt at least twice during the Iron Age, and destroyed in an extensive conflagration during the ninth century.</page><page sequence="12">496 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M. BIKAI [AJA 103 Trenches XXXIIJ/L: Iron Age civic building (ca. 1300- 850 B.C.). During the 1996 field season, excava- tions 5 m west of the Migdol temple revealed a mas- sive mudbrick building that appeared to have been destroyed during the Iron Age. Excavations in 1997 uncovered parts of five rooms within a very large well-preserved mudbrick building. Most of the 1-m- thick red-brown mudbrick walls, once plastered yel- low, are preserved to a height of 3-4 m. The struc- ture also seems to have been destroyed in a major conflagration in the ninth century. Many storage, food preparation, and drinking vessels dating to the Early Iron II period were recovered from extensive debris layers. The monumental structure may be the long-sought palace of the Iron Age rulers of Pella. Trenches IX XX-ZZ: Cella of the Byzantine cathedral church. Excavations in the northern half of the Byz- antine Cathedral cella (ca. 550-750 A.D.) in 1996 exposed a red-and-white-tiled pavement along the en- tire north aisle. The northern row of 10 column bases was exposed, fallen columns were removed, and sev- eral Late Byzantine capitals were recovered. All dated material is consistent with a sixth-century construc- tion date and a final destruction at the very end of the Umayyad period. The 1997 excavations concen- trated on the southern half of the cella and exposed the southern row of column bases, several columns, and a number of elaborate capitals. An elaborate polychrome mosaic pavement was detected in sev- eral places across the southern aisle but was not fully exposed pending evaluation by Madaba Mosaic School experts. Evidence for a small bench along the southern wall and an insubstantial rough stone wall separating the body of the cella from the apses was detected. These may relate to the use of the church as a caravanserai before the earthquake of 749/750 destroyed the structure. Trenches XXXVA-F: Byzantine/Early Umayyad north- ern suburbs. In 1997 six new trenches were laid out in the saddle between the eastern end of the main tell and the lower western slopes of Jebel Abu al- Khas. Two main phases of architecture, dated ca. 350- 650 A.D., were isolated by the end of the season. The earliest phase is represented by a large room, 8 X 4 m, with a substantial stone threshold for double doors in the short western wall. The room was paved with stone, with small stone benches in the northwest and southwest corners and a column drum reused as a bench along the north wall. Walls are preserved to a height of 1.3 m. A few complete objects were found in the room, including a bronze pot with iron handles and two lamps. All appeared to have fallen from niches in the mudbrick walls. Prelim- inary identification of coins and pottery indicate a short occupational span; the building is likely to have been constructed within the first half of the fourth century and abandoned at the end of that century. Immediately above the threshold of the fourth-century room were fragmentary remains of a room with a rebuilt and reinforced doorway. Almost 150 small coins of significant numismatic interest were recovered from the cobbles on either side of the door. This structure is tentatively dated to the fifth century. Above this phase, part of a courtyard, kitchen, and the stable area of a substantial house form the exca- vated evidence of the latest main occupational phase. The architecture and artifacts find many par- allels in the extensive sixth through eighth century material excavated on the eastern end of the main mound during the early 1980s. The complex ap- pears to have been destroyed and abandoned in the seventh century. Subsequent occupation is limited to robber trenches in the kitchen and temporary struc- tures in the courtyard. A large pit in the center of the courtyard was crammed with large pieces of animal skeletons (predominately cow and pig) and much occupational debris, perhaps representing the clean- up operation after a single catastrophic event, possi- bly the 660 earthquake. Two small soundings were laid out 20 m north of the civic complex church on the line of the Ionic col- onnade. Two parallel walls with a stone-paved floor between them were uncovered. The westernmost wall had large orthostats preserved on top of its 1-m-high course, suggesting a stable area, perhaps for camels. Qa'a Abu Tleyha West. Sumio Fujii, University of Kanazawa, reports: The al-Jafr Basin Prehistoric Survey and Excava- tion Project (JBSEP), begun in 1997, conducted its second season in 1998. The project aims to study prehistoric adaptations in the arid peripheries of the southern Levant and focused on the excavation of Qa'a Abu Tleyha West, a large EB flint quarry and knapping site located in the northwestern part of the basin. The site lies halfway between al-Huseiniyeh and al-Jafr and faces a small salt pan, Qa'a Abu Tleyha, to the southeast. The gentle hill on which the site stands includes a line of Eocene flint out- croppings, the material source for this quarry and knapping site. Several stone structures are exposed on the Hammada surface. Two large structures and some small features have been excavated thus far. Structure 01, the main focus of the 1997 season, consisted of six semicircular units around a central communal space, forming a large, flower-shaped complex about 23 m in diameter. Construction ma- terial was primarily undressed limestone cobbles and</page><page sequence="13">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 497 ::::~:::::::::: :::::::: ::::I-,", mij -: , : -...::. .::: ........ ......-- ::::::: ::::: _:-----:-:-- .:--iiii ii::- ii iiiiii iiiiiiiiiii-I-i-: :IN A;- :::::-:_:::: ?::-::-::: : _:-_-:---::'S ig: ?i:---?-:;:c- -- :ii--:j::: W E Fig. 7. Qa'a Abu Tleyha West. Structures 01 and 02 (front left). boulders, with some exhausted flint cores of tabular scrapers. The walls were generally built in a single row, and the construction materials were laid on a rough pavement of limestone rubble. Some walls in- cluded upright limestone boulders in a shallow foun- dation ditch. The original walls were about 1 m high, probably forming a kind of tent-base structure, a long tradition in the region. Hundreds of tabular scrapers and relevant debitage were recovered from structure 01; bores, perforators, and other tools ac- counted for only 10 percent of the tool inventory. It appears that the complex was used as a workshop for the production of tabular scrapers. Tabular scraper cores, excluding those reused for construc- tion material, were rarely found in structure 01 but were concentrated in flint outcrop areas some 50 m south of the structure. This suggests that core prep- aration and blank detachment took place in the outcrop area and that the tool blanks were then brought to structure 01 to be processed into fin- ished tools. The presence of some limestone anvils and flint/limestone hammerstones in the structure supports this view. Structure 01 (fig. 7) is the first workshop of tabu- lar scraper production to be confirmed beyond the limits of the Sinai/Negev area, thus shedding new light on the trade network of EB society. As a com- posite structure, it also provides information about the social organization of EB specialized flint knap- pers, and the rich collection of tabular scrapers, cores, and debitage provides an overall picture of tabular scraper production strategy. Structure 02, discovered during the excavation of the westernmost unit of structure 01 and only par- tially excavated thus far, is a small, single-unit struc- ture (ca. 3 X 5 m) with a roughly rectangular plan. It is lined with two rows of upright limestone slabs in a narrow foundation ditch. Since the wall of structure 02 was partly reused as a buttress for the upright limestone boulders of structure 01, it would appear to predate structure 01. Because of a lack of diagnos- tic artifacts from structure 02, however, the chrono- logical assessment must await 14C dating, now in progress, and further excavation. Structure 03 was excavated in 1998 for compari- son with structure 01 and is a small, semicircular, single-unit structure with upright limestone boul- ders in the central part of the wall. Similarities in construction suggest that structure 03 is a prototype of structure 01. A preliminary comparison of tabular scrapers recovered from the two structures may pro- vide a clue to the chronological sequence of this still debatable tool class. Rarely trimmed, round tabular scrapers are predominant in structure 03, while trimmed, triangular and rectangular tabular scrap- ers are frequent in structure 01. A noteworthy discovery, which will help to clarify production strategy at the site, was a refitted exam- ple of tabular scrapers. This revealed that the appli- cation of punch technique to the dorsal surface of a robust blank resulted in the splitting of the blanks into several pieces, some of which were retouched into triangular tabular scrapers, while others were left unmodified as geometric debitage. Structure 1001, a small, oval structure located about 150 m south of structure 01, was discovered at the end of the 1998 season. Though not yet excavated, surface collection at the site unexpectedly yielded Canaanean blades and relevant cores and debitage. The evidence suggests that Canaanean blade knappers might have coexisted with tabular scraper knappers at Qa'a Abu Tleyha West, possibly sharing the same flint outcrop. Preliminary results of the first two seasons at Qa'a Abu Tleyha West suggest that the settlement was a</page><page sequence="14">498 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M.

Fischer, G6teborg University, reports: In the ninth season of excavation at Tell Abu al- Kharaz in the northern Jordan Valley, two areas were further investigated: area 7 in the northern part of the upper plateau, where excavations began in 1993, and area 9 in the southern part, partially excavated in 1994. Early Bronze Age IB/II. Supplementary information from the second part of the EB I (phase I) and the EB II (phase II) was obtained in area 9. A domestic complex was built against the southern part of the city wall, the foundation of which is from the EB IB. Phase I at Tell Abu al-Kharaz is contemporaneous with the later part of the Egyptian Dynasty "0" or Naqada IIIB. The synchronism was established by two Egyptian cylindrical jars from the site that corre- spond to types W 85 and 49 1, classified by Petrie. These vessels are most characteristic of the Naqada IIIB period, at the end of which the reigns of the Dy- nasty "0" kings Irj-Hor and Ka are placed. To the au- thor's knowledge, the jars are the most northeasterly and the only Transjordanian finds belonging to the Naqada IIIB culture. Other pottery wares are Grain Wash/Band Slip and locally produced bowls, platters, juglets, and jugs-often red, brown, and pattern- burnished. The city wall of phase II is preserved to a height of 3 m and a width of more than 3 m. Pottery includes locally produced and mainly burnished wares, as well as metallic wares imported from the Upper Gali- lee, according to petrographic analyses. A collared cylinder seal of bone was found, the third of this type from the site. Late Middle Bronze Age/Late Bronze Age L This pe- riod corresponds to phases IV and V of the occupa- tional sequence at Tell Abu al-Kharaz. Architectural remains from the sixteenth century B.C. were re- vealed built against the northern city wall in area 7. These include foundations of a workshop for the production of bronze objects, where a clay tuyere with an almost glazed interior surface was recovered. Pottery from these phases includes Chocolate-on- White ware, both bichrome and monochrome, and other plain, monochrome, and bichrome decorated wares. A typology of Chocolate-on-White ware, which now comprises 347 stratified vessels from all seasons, was established and six subgroups were identified. The petrographically analyzed samples indicate two production areas for Chocolate-on-White ware: the central Jordan Valley and the Upper Galilee (south- ern Lebanon). }: { ii% ,, , !:!{}{:i!{  !i-i.:~iiiiii~i~ i :;ii ...... }{',i-~li~i~i i~i~i~ii i ... ........... lliiii~i! {:: : i: !}i :i  ~~~- ! : ::{'{!! i{{i{ i i  Fig. 8. Tell Abu al-Kharaz. Middle/Late Bronze Age oven reinforced with a variety of ceramic sherds. A domestic building was found just inside the southern city wall in area 9, along with a stone grain silo and a clay oven (fig. 8). The oven was reinforced with a variety of ceramic wares, a practice that seems to be characteristic of the late MBA and the early LBA at Tell Abu al-Kharaz. Similar ovens were found during the 1995 and 1996 seasons, and the use of dif- ferent ceramic wares allows the establishment of a reliable synchronism. Iron Age. The well-preserved remains of two addi- tional Iron Age II houses were discovered west of a house from the same period excavated in 1993 (AJA 99 [1995] 515). More than 100 loom weights and a number of spindle whorls were discovered in one of the rooms, which appears to have been used for tex- tile production and storage. Other tools and several complete ceramic vessels were also recovered, in- cluding a storage jar, a lamp, a strainer, and two un- usual vessels: a three-handled jar with a cup-shaped spout, and a small jar with four horizontal lug han- dles. A neatly finished cosmetic palette of white lime- stone with blue decoration was found, the second one recovered from the site. Khirbet Iskander. Jesse C. Long, Jr., Lubbock Christian University, and Bill Libby, McMurry Uni- versity, report: The seventh campaign at Khirbet Iskander and vi- cinity, in June and July 1998, was a season of restora- tion and conservation of the EBA remains in area C, including the three phases of EB IV occupation and the entryway into the town in the final phase. The Khirbet Iskander Expedition is sponsored by Drew University, Lubbock Christian University, Gannon University, and McMurry University (S. Richard and J. Long, co-directors). The project also conducted a one-week environmental survey of the Wadi Walla around Iskander (see the report by C. Cordova, supra).

C3, east guardroom before resto- ration. cavated in the southern Levant, Khirbet Iskander of- fers a unique opportunity to study both culture change and continuity during the decline at the end of the EBA. With the discovery of significant EB II/ III material on the mound in the 1997 season, Khir- bet Iskander becomes a unique laboratory for ana- lyzing socioeconomic change at the end of the third millennium B.C. The gate restored in 1998 is the only such EB IV structure excavated to date. Guardrooms, storage areas, and specialized work areas with platforms flank this bench-lined gateway that served as an en- trance into what appears to have been an upper town. Intensive mapping of much of the site and ex- cavation at the northwest corner of the mound in 1997 clarified the relationship of the gate to the for- tification walls that run across the mound. The 1997 season securely dated the massive northwest tower to EB II/III and at the same time demonstrated the re- use of the earlier fortifications in concert with less substantial defense structures in the EB IV-a de- fense alignment that incorporated the entryway in area C. Thus, the area C gateway and accompanying defense features are important for articulating changes in settlement strategies from the preceding urban period. The gate had deteriorated since exposure during the 1987 season; therefore, the project objectives were to clear the area of debris, to restore walls and other features that had been disturbed, and to pro- tect the architectural features of area C from further destruction. The project used architectural plans and excavation photographs and succeeded in recon- structing most of the architectural features. The re- construction encompassed all three phases of EB IV occupation, including phase 1 structures in squares C2 and C6, and the phase 2 broad-room house be- neath the phase 3 gate in squares C2, C3 (figs. 9- Fig. 10. Khirbet Iskander. C3, east guardroom after resto- ration. 10), and C5. An effort was made to recreate the look of the original structure at exposure. ACOR director P. Bikai, the expedition's technical consultant, who oversaw the conservation of the gate, provided ex- pertise and a formula for a reversible mortar appro- priate for the conservation of antiquities. Madaba Plains Project. Douglas R. Clark, Walla Walla College; Lawrence T. Geraty, La Sierra Univer- sity; Larry G. Herr, Canadian Union College; and 0ystein S. LaBianca, Andrews University, report: The Madaba Plains Project (MPP) continued ex- cavations in 1998 at Tall al-'Umayri and Tall Hisban to study cycles of land use in central Transjordan. Tall al-'Umayri. Excavations revealed more earthen floors surrounding an EB I dolmen on the southeast- ern slope of the hill. This is the first dolmen in the Mediterranean basin to produce quantities of buri- als (20), complete EB I pottery vessels (20), and sur- faces indicating patterns of use. The team also uncov- ered three new cities that date to periods of limited settlement in Jordan. (The site has already produced substantial remains from more populated periods; altogether there are almost 20 superimposed cities.) The most impressive new discoveries include the re- mains of a stone building dating from the MBA. Also from this period are the foundations of a tower perched on a great earthen rampart that raised the height of the hill more than 5 m. Associated with this tower was a well-plastered pool, which may be unique from this period in Jordan. There is also evi- dence for a large building made of massive stones in- side the fortification system. The discovery of such substantial remains from the MBA was unexpected. Just north of these ruins and slightly higher is a two-room building dating to the LBA (fig. 11). There were two levels of floors to the structure. Each floor was covered with a thick layer of burned bricks and wood, probably from destructions caused by in-</page><page sequence="16">500 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M. BIKAI [AJA 103 Fig. 11. Madaba Plains. Late Bronze Age two-room build- ing in Field B on the western acropolis of Tall al-'Umayri. vading armies. The foundations of this building have not yet been reached. The walls, constructed of flat stones that look much like mudbricks, stand over 3 m tall. Debris from the massive destruction of the Early Iron I town consists of burned bricks and roofing materials, such as wooden beams and reeds. This town also appears to have been destroyed by a mili- tary invasion, judging from the many bronze weap- ons found in the debris. One of the stone-pillared rooms was filled with almost 2 m of ash (fig. 12). The thick wall of this town was made of large stones, some over 1 m in diameter and almost 2 m long. The wall was plastered in antiquity and has been exca- vated to a height of 3-4 m. To define the southern limits of the Iron II/Per- sian administrative complex, the team excavated a large wall that probably dates to the Early Iron Age and was reused by the Late Iron Age bureaucrats who ran the administrative complex. South of this wall are other buildings dating to the Persian and Hellenistic periods. During the Hellenistic period, a small farmstead was constructed on the southern edge of the site, above more substantial ruins from the Iron Age II. Among the small finds were about 10 seals and seal impressions, bringing the total to over 80, mak- ing this one of the largest collections from any site in Palestine. Another find, unique in Jordan, is a frag- mentary, life-sized ceramic statue. Pieces include a dramatically painted eye, an ear, a chin with a thin mouth, parts of arms, two heels, and parts of the chest and shoulders. The subsurface mapping team again used ground penetrating radar (GPR) and conducted a differential Global Positioning System (GPS) survey at the site. Neighboring slopes were surveyed for tombs, and seis- mic reflection research was conducted at TallJalul. Fig. 12. Madaba Plains. Iron I pillared room in field A on the western acropolis of Tall al-'Umayri. Tall Hisban and vicinity. A systematic survey of the hill of Hisban resulted in the identification of 154 stone tool fragments dating from the Middle and Upper Palaeolithic periods. An Epipalaeo- lithic lunate was found-either an arrowhead or sickle blade-as well as several Neolithic axes and arrowheads. Excavations in a cave complex near the summit of the tell produced several hammers, scrapers, and arrowheads. Beyond the tell, 57 sites containing scatters of prehistoric worked-stone tools were identified. Fieldwork this season produced no new informa- tion on Chalcolithic and Bronze Age uses of the tell, although an EBA cemetery less than 1 km from the tell had been discovered in previous seasons. The team identified a massive Iron I bedrock trench some 4 m deep and 2-3 m wide running east-west across the south shoulder of the tell, probably a dry moat to protect the Iron I village at its weakest point. Tall Hisban was a prospering town during the Iron II period, as indicated by the quantity of ceramic ob- jects and inscriptions dated to this period, but there are few architectural remains. New excavations on the northeast corner of the tell suggest an Iron I cave complex later reused by the Iron II inhabitants as a necropolis. Use of caves continued and intensified into the Hellenistic period; a massive fortification of four large towers linked by massive perimeter walls was constructed at the summit of the hill around 200 B.C. During the Byzantine period Tall Hisban incor- porated well over a thousand households. Excava- tions south of the Mamluk bath complex on the summit of the tell revealed an Islamic building with a series of small vaulted rooms clustered around a cen- tral courtyard. The arrangement of the spaces in this building and its construction, reminiscent of palaces of Mamluk administrators in Kerak and Aqaba, sug- gests an administrative palace.</page><page sequence="17">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 501 The team carried out an intensive survey of water and soil management structures in the wadi to the west of Hisban. They mapped an elaborate water management system consisting of terraced hillsides and many check-dams to control erosion. The re- mains of numerous agricultural cisterns and a reser- voir were also documented. Tell Madaba. Timothy P. Harrison, University of Toronto, reports: The Tell Madaba Archaeological Project (TMAP) is part of a larger, ongoing multidisciplinary regional research effort to investigate adaptive strategies and social institutions developed by early urban commu- nities in the semiarid highlands of central Jordan. TMAP was initiated to gather archaeological data from the presumed urban center of a regional settle- ment network for comparison with existing data sets from rural village sites in the region. A preliminary field season was conducted in 1996 to define the ex- tent of the tell and to assess the feasibility of carrying out long-term excavations at the site. Full-scale excavations to document the archaeo- logical history of the western slope of the tell acropo- lis began in the 1998 field season. The primary goals of the season were: 1) to begin assembling extensive, quantifiable collections of botanical, faunal, ceramic, and lithic materials for each of the principal phases of occupation at the site; 2) to map and record associ- ated architectural remains; 3) to conduct the prelimi- nary processing and laboratory analysis of the material evidence recovered; and 4) to integrate the architec- tural and artifact records in a GIS-formatted relational database that will permit detailed regional analysis. The excavations were confined to five squares, en- compassing 150 m2, and resulted in a five-phase strati- graphic sequence. The earliest deposits reached con- sisted of a series of Iron II (probably ninth-eighth centuries B.C.) soil layers sealed against the inner face of a large fortification wall made of unhewn boulder-sized stones. The wall itself, originally con- structed directly on bedrock, proved to be consider- ably larger than initially thought. Its external face had been exposed prior to this excavation, and its external face was preserved in places to a height of more than 4 m. The excavations suggested a com- plex construction history, including at least two ef- forts to widen the wall, which reaches 7 m at its great- est extent. The foundation level of the wall was not reached, but residual EB pottery suggests that it was originally constructed during the Bronze Age and ceased to function as a freestanding structure during the Iron II period. On the summit of the acropolis, excavations un- covered a three-phase sequence of superimposed structures and associated surfaces spanning the Late Hellenistic (second/first centuries B.C.) and Early Roman/Nabataean (first century B.C./A.D.) cul- tural horizons. The pottery of the uppermost phase was distinguished by large quantities of classic Naba- taean painted wares, both imported and local imita- tions, and Early Roman fine wares, suggesting a deci- sive shift in the ceramic industry of the site and the incorporation of Madaba into a southern, Nabataean- oriented socioeconomic and cultural sphere. The final stratigraphic phase was represented by an arched wall that ran along the crest of the tell and a series of associated trash pits. Large foundation trenches had been cut into earlier levels to secure the structure, and although difficult to ascertain, in- vestigations suggest that substantial portions of the site (primarily Byzantine and Early Islamic levels) were removed or leveled in the process of con- structing the building. The pottery recovered from these pits consists predominantly of Late Ottoman handmade wares, including several Ottoman pipes. This Late Ottoman building activity corresponds to the well-attested (and historically documented) late 19th-century resettlement of Madaba. Finally, in the process of clearing the outer face of the fortification wall, several Late Byzantine/Early Is- lamic (sixth to early eighth centuries) structures were found abutting this wall. Although originally exposed during bulldozing in the mid 1980s, it was nevertheless possible to delineate the remains of at least three rooms, one of which originally contained a mosaic floor before being converted to a two-story structure by means of a vault. One of the rooms con- tained a series of unused candlestick lamps and the fragmentary remains of a painted fresco. Wadi ath-Thamad. P.M.M. Daviau, Wilfrid Laurier University, reports: During a third season of excavation and survey by the Wadi ath-Thamad Project, a Canadian team un- earthed new information about the Iron Age fortifi- cations and the Nabataean/Early Roman town at Khirbat al-Mudayna, on the south bank of the Wadi ath-Thamad. Excavations on the tell were supervised by R. Chadwick; C. Cordova conducted a geographi- cal survey of the wadi (reported in C. Cordova, su- pra), and C. Foley directed the regional survey. Iron Age gate. Khirbat al-Mudayna is a small, steep mound about 40 km south of Amman. Two prior sea- sons of excavation exposed rooms of a six-chambered gate and provided 14C dates of 810 and 790 B.C. from tree and reed samples. In the 1998 season, ex- cavation in the central road of the six-chambered gateway at the north end of the tell revealed the de- bris of collapsed upper-story rooms along the entire</page><page sequence="18">502 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M. BIKAI [AJA 103 length of the road. This debris included ceiling ma- terial, fine wall plaster, and roof beams. The piers of the gaterooms remained standing above the level of the ground floor. Along the roadway, each room was partially blocked off by a thin crosswall that framed small doorways opening into each room. The fact that both the piers and the crosswalls were covered with the same plaster suggests that they are contempora- neous. Scattered throughout the debris in the road were iron and bronze arrowheads, indicating that an attack brought the town to an end. Finds included animal figurines, seals, and female figurines. Nabataean settlement. Work in the lower town re- vealed a large (10 x 16 m) reservoir that had been lined with plaster and covered with a ceiling sup- ported by opposing arches. A small number of Naba- taean to Early Roman period sherds and partially re- storable ceramic vessels testify to the principal period of use. To the north, in a typical Nabataean house, a stone pavement was exposed in the southern room (810), and an elaborate threshold led north from room 801 into another area possibly into a court- yard. Coins found in both buildings, along with Tha- mudic inscriptions and painted pottery from Petra, will help date the structures, probably to about the first century A.D. Regional survey. The survey team identified 24 new sites in the Wadi ath-Thamad area dating from the Middle Palaeolithic to the Byzantine period. Of special note is the discovery of two broken building stones, each with a Thamudic inscription, from site 16 (West Ureinebeh), where a complete inscription was recovered in 1996. The largest known inscrip- tion was recovered at site 48; the Thamudic text con- sists of more than 500 characters and measures more than 1.5 X 2.5 m. NABATAEAN - ROMAN - BYZANTINE - ISLAMIC Khirbet edh-Dharih. Zeidoun al-Muheisen, Yar- mouk University, and Francois Villeneuve, IFAPO/ Ecole Normale Superieure, report: The temple area at Khirbet edh-Dharih was the main focus of the 1998 season of archaeological work. Part of the ancient pavement, once thought to be made of beaten earth, was cleared near the south- west wall of the south temenos and revealed to be far more substantial. The courtyard probably functioned as a receiving area and shelter for worshippers and pilgrims who came to the temple. Inside the cella, soundings along the southern wall revealed part of a former pavement far below the present floor. This dis- covery provides evidence for a sanctuary prior to the present temple, which dates to the first century A.D., and supports the inscription of the keeper of the La'aban spring, dated to 7 B.C., stating that the area was already settled during the first century B.C. Two rooms were cleared on the eastern side of the corridor surrounding the adyton, verifying the sym- metrical plan of the cella (fig. 13). The larger room is rectangular (3.1 X 2.1 m), and the smaller is Fig. 13. Khirbet edh-Dharih. The temple after the clearing of the rooms east of the adyton.</page><page sequence="19">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 503 Fig. 14. Khirbet edh-Dharih. Bust of Castor and Pollux. square (2.5 X 2.4 m). Stucco was recovered deco- rated with red and black geometrical motifs and with panels of large diamonds. A small underground space (1.7 X 1.7 m) covered with two arches was found under the southern room. In the northern room a staircase badly preserved at the bottom leads to an upper floor. The function of these two rooms in the Nabataean period remains hypothetical, but during the Byzantine/Umayyad period, they were used as storage areas for oil and wine, as indicated by the number of storage jars recovered that date to these periods. An oil press was found inside the te- menos during the 1998 campaign. The Mamlouk/ Early Ottoman occupation level is represented by structures built over a heap of stones and blocks 2 m high. During this period, the character of the settle- ment was domestic, as indicated by the rough pot- tery and thick mixed layer of ash and black soil, at- testing to intensive daily use. Work continued in the area where a number of blocks were found in 1993, among them a head of Me- dusa and a bust of Hermes-Mercury assimilated to the Nabataean god Al-Kutba. The blocks collected during the 1998 season had fallen from the outer fa- cade of the southern wall of the temple, crushing cows in a manger below. Since parts of the temple were used for domestic purposes during the Umayyad period, we can assume that this collapse is due to the earthquake ofJanuary 749. Among the fallen blocks are a relief of Castor and Pollux (fig. 14), two reliefs of Tyche (fig. 15), a bust of a deity with horns, per- haps the zodiacal figure of the Taurus (fig. 16), and a Fig. 15.

Martha SharpJoukowsky, Brown University, reports: The sixth season of excavations at the Great Tem- ple of Petra took place between June 9 and August 10, 1998 (figs. 17-18). In the propylaeum, an arched walkway parallel to the colonnaded street was excavated to a depth of 3.5 m. It was constructed earlier than the present steps leading from the colonnaded street into the temple precinct. In the lower temenos, the east exe- dra was completely excavated. This semicircular structure was elegantly buttressed and appointed with interior benches and a central podium, which may have served for the placement of statuary. The east exedra is now preserved to a height of 5.8 m, an exterior width of 12.4 m, an interior width of 6.7 m, and a depth of 5.4 m from the double entry columns to the rear wall. From the east exedra, there is now a grand vista over the triple colonnaded walkways of the lower temenos, where the capitals were adorned with the carved heads of Asian elephants. Five pilas- ters were found with figures sculpted in relief; one was embellished with an ornamental wreath. These elements probably fell from the temple facade and served as building components for later walls. Behind the east exedra, an arched structure mea- suring 10 X 3.5 X 5 m deep, partially cut out of bed- rock, was fully excavated. It originally served as a cis- tern and was later used as a dump, and perhaps as a workshop. A full repertoire of early second-century Nabataean painted and plain wares was recovered here, including many pieces of exquisitely painted plaster (one with a partial Nabataean inscription), a Nabataean-inscribed bronze plaque, bone imple- ments, and several Nabataean coins. In the temple, the excavation of the west corridor, with frescoed walls standing to a height of 6 m, was completed. This excavation made it possible to mea- sure the temple as 42.5 m in length. The visitor can now walk down the west corridor and mount the southwest stairs to the center of the temple for a view of the inner rooms. One can then descend via the newly consolidated north-south vaulted stairway, through the arch into the west corridor, to the par- tially excavated theatron, the pronaos, and the tem- ple entrance. The inner central arch of the temple was exca- vated to a depth of 5.25 m. Cut out of bedrock and measuring 8.52 x 3.32 m, the temple floor was com- prised of a canalization system with an additional se- ries of channels cut into the bedrock. A Nabataean cup was found in the canalization. In the debris above were 160 coins, tentatively dated to the Late Roman period.</page><page sequence="22">506 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M.

Here the initial deposit was clogged with fallen column drums and capitals decorated with fruit, acanthus, and Nabataean floral designs. Several drums were removed, stabilized, and reerected. Con- solidation and conservation projects included the anastylosis and reerection of 11 courses of the heart- shaped southeastern column at the rear of the tem- ple. The eastern stairway leading from the lower te- menos to the temple forecourt was also restored. In the 1998 catalog are 186 coins, painted stucco including a partial human face, 40 additional ele- phant parts, 37 lamp fragments, and 24 Nabataean bowls, cups, unguentaria, and figurines. Nearly 34,000 fragments of pottery, bone, metal, and glass are clas- sified in the site database. Petra. Lower Market survey. Leigh-Ann Bedal, University of Pennsylvania, reports: The Petra Lower Market survey was conducted in 1998 in collaboration with the Brown University ex- cavations of the Great Temple. The goal of the project was to investigate the area of the site desig- nated as the "lower market." W. Bachmann et al. (Petra, Wissenschaftliche Veroffentlichungen des Deutsch- Turkischen Denkmalschutz-Kommandos, Berlin and Leipzig 1921) designated the area as a large market- place divided into three sections: "upper market," "middle market," and "lower market." The repeated reproduction of Bachmann's plan of Petra has per- petuated the concept of these areas as markets de- spite the lack of archaeological investigation. The site's central location, monumental scale, and labor- intensive construction-it was cut deep into the side of a rocky slope on a large stone-built platform- suggest that the lower market was part of the cere- monial, economic, and political center of the city, and therefore must have been of great importance to life in Petra. Excavations (figs. 18-19) revealed that the entire southern half of the lower market is occupied by a monumental open-air pool (46 X 23 X 2.5 m). The east-west wall (3.5 m wide) forms the north retain- ing wall for the pool, and the interior face of this wall as well as the floor of the pool are lined with hydrau- lic cement. Steps in the northeast corner provided easy access into the pool. At the center of the pool was an island pavilion or shrine (11.5 X 14 m) built on a 2.5-m-high pedestal of stone faced with hydraulic cement. A bridge al- lowed access to the pavilion from the center of the retaining wall. The walls of the pavilion are pre- served to three courses and constructed of large sandstone ashlars with thick mortar. A 4.5-m-wide doorway marks the front (north) entrance of the</page><page sequence="23">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 507 building; similarly wide doorways were detected on the east and west sides of the pavilion. Based on the fill in and around the pavilion, its interior was origi- nally decorated with painted and molded plaster and tiles of imported marble. The rectangular tiles that paved the floor of the pavilion were removed by looters in antiquity, but their impressions are pre- served in the underlying bedding. Fragments of Naba- taean fineware found mixed into the bedding provide a terminus ante quem of the late first/early second cen- tury A.D. for the construction of the pavilion. The evidence suggests that the lower terrace was the site of a formal garden. Such gardens, or paradei- soi, are known in association with ancient Assyrian, Babylonian, and Achaemenid palaces. Swimming pools and artificial lakes became a popular feature of paradeisoi during the Hellenistic period (I. Nielsen, Hellenistic Palaces: Tradition and Renewal, Aarhus 1994). The most comparable examples to Petra's paradeisos known archaeologically are the pleasure gardens of the many palaces of Herod the Great dated to the late first century B.C.; a circular island pavilion embellishes the garden pool at Herodium (E. Netzer, Greater Herodium, Qedem 13, Jerusalem 1981). Petra's paradeisos appears to belong to the larger Great Temple, through which one had to pass to gain access into the garden. However, a doorway flanked by two columns was uncovered on the es- carpment overlooking the pool and may mark an en- trance to the gardens from the residential quarters on ez-Zantur to the south (A. Bignasca et al., Petra, Ez Zantur I, Mainz 1996). Access to the gardens from public and residential quarters of the city may indi- cate a more public function for Petra's paradeisos than was typical for the palace gardens listed above. Based on the material remains, the pool contin- ued in use until the mid-fourth century A.D., when the pavilion walls and bridge collapsed, their debris filling much of the pool and putting it out of use. This destruction is most likely the result of the 363 earthquake. Petra. Roman Street Project. Chrysanthos Kanel- lopoulos, ACOR, reports: Consolidation and restoration work at the Roman Street Project was completed in 1998 and an archi- tectural study conducted. The early (Nabataean) street was almost 18 m wide, corresponding to the full width of the temenos gate, and ran between the Roman bath complex and the north tower (traditional designations are used here for such structures). The street was a sand and gravel track; during Z.T. Fiema's excavations in 1997 (Annual of the Department of Antiquities of Jordan 42 [1998] 395-424), two hard-packed surfaces partially paved with small irregular cobbles were discovered. The narrow, oblong temenos of Qasr el-Bint seems to be an extension of the early wide street. The shops on the south side of the colonnaded street were ini- tially square rooms measuring 4.7 X 4.8 m, facing north and with a portico running in front of them (fig. 20; shop XXVII). The clear space of the original portico was about 2.80 m. It cannot be ascertained how far these early structures extended to the west or whether they were indeed shops. The northern- most line of the early structures corresponds to the corners of the temenos gate. A subsequent remodeling narrowed the street from 18 m to 6.20 m, such that the side entrances of the 18-m-wide temenos gate corresponded with the colonnaded sidewalks. There are parallels, such as the triumphal arch at Timgad and the three-way arch of Palmyra. The square shops were expanded to the north and became oblong. A new front wall was constructed on the stylobate of the earlier colon- nade, a new sidewalk was built, and a new colonnade 5.45 m from the shop facades was erected (fig. 20; shop XXVIII). Commercial use of the expanded shops is established from the predominance of stor- age jars among the finds. The installation of beds around the walls of shop XXVIII, the shop south of the staircase, indicates that it was used as a tavern, and its proximity to the nymphaeum, which pro- vided running water, may also suggest a commercial need for a reliable water supply. The doorways of the shops have widths ranging from 1.24 to 1.68 m, but the doorway of shop XIX north of the staircase is only 0.89 m wide. This may be related to security concerns: more than 100 coins were discovered in- side the room. During the same building phase, the staircase was constructed leading to the upper market and the street was paved (fig. 21). Architectural observations support archaeological evidence from excavations carried out by Z.T. Fiema. Limestone boulders incor- porated into the support framework of the staircase may be scrap from the paving stones, suggesting that the street and the staircase were built as parts of the same project. The Trajanic arch was built on the sidewalk in front of the staircase at the same time, interrupting the eastern end of the colonnade. Although no col- onnade existed in front of the staircase, the width of the staircase equals the distance between seven columns spaced according to the average interaxial column spacing of the colonnade. The overall width of the piers of the Trajanic arch is equal to the aver- age interaxial column spacing of the colonnade, indi- cating that the dimensions of the pedestals conformed</page><page sequence="24">508 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M.

Kanellpoulos) to and respected the rhythm of the colonnade. Had the arch been symmetrically situated relative to the staircase, it would have been one of the largest such arches in Jordan, with an opening measuring ca. 6.20 m. It should be noted that the staircase to the propylaea and the upper market is too steep to have been used for camels or horses. The area around the staircase to the upper market can be considered a station or resting point within the city. It generally marks the end of the necropolis and the entrance into the narrower city, a more orga- nized, artificial environment. The canyon ofWadi el- Mataha, meeting Wadi Musa at this very point, the cliffs opposite, along with a narrowing of the land- scape, must have created a natural border. The nym- phaeum, the staircase to the upper market across from it, flanked by a shop used as a restaurant and a room that served as a treasury of some kind, give evi- dence of the character of the area. From the colonnaded street, and with the doors of temenos gate shut, traffic was distributed through "exits" south and north to the upper market, middle market, Great Temple, and across bridges over the wadi to the so-called palace and the Temple of the Winged Lions. The lack of wheel marks on the pave- ment of the colonnaded street supports the hypothe- sis that it was not a main thoroughfare. Since circula- tion within the street does not seem to have given access to domestic areas of the city, the street may have served as the processional way leading to sev- eral piazzas and sanctuaries. Softer sandstone pavers were used beyond the temenos gate, inside the sa- cred space of the sanctuary where constant traffic was probably not allowed. The arrangement, with a nymphaeum at the beginning, resembles the colon- naded street along the river bank at Leptis Magna. The A.D. 363 earthquake caused a partial destruc- tion of the colonnade. Later, Byzantine structures were built from reused blocks against the shop fa- cades, thus encroaching onto the colonnaded side- walk of the prior phase. Some of these later Byzantine constructions extended over the pavement, resulting in a further narrowing of the street (fig. 22). Restoration work in 1998 involved the enhance- ment of the remains of the western pier of the Tra- janic arch, the facade wall of five shops and colon- nade, reconstruction of arched walls inside the shops from original voussoirs and ceiling beams, and the</page><page sequence="25">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 509 ,' ' iYli `?llk~~ 1 1 r' ~ I `` i I i I a Oe : 1 ii rI II a a a ? a -I a o I a n o 1 a a i a ;'Z a ?r u r Ir ` ?

The foundation of the staircase was consolidated, and dislocated blocks of the pavement in front of the shops were reset; this included reincorporating more than 20 scattered flagstones. Iron doorframes were installed to brace the exposed doorjambs, and iron doors in three of the doorways limit access to shops that may now safely be used as storage rooms for architectural elements found in the area. Petra. North Ridge Project. Patricia M. Bikai, ACOR, reports: Excavations on the northern ridge were con- ducted from March 25-April 2, and from September 21-24, 1998. The objectives were to continue investi- gation of the southern approach to the ridge and to finalize the presentation of the Ridge Church. Northern side. Excavations outside of the north- ern wall of the church revealed the existence of a shaft just next to, and extending under, the founda- tion of the church. The shaft was cleared, and a cham- ber tomb with four loculi was found. The tomb had been robbed before-or at the time of-the construc- tion of the Byzantine church. Nevertheless, coins and a gold earring were recovered, as were large quanti- ties of ceramics, including several intact bowls, lamp fragments, figurine fragments, and bones, all of which are now being studied. The ceramics, which include at least 200 restorable forms and many unique exam- ples of Nabataean painted vessels, date from the later part of the first century A.D. into the second century. At the time of the construction of the north wall of the church, a foundation for that wall was con- structed in the shaft of the tomb. Within the founda- tion wall, a lamp dating to the late fourth century was found, possibly indicating the date of the con- struction of the church. Southern approach. On the south side of the church there is a large open area of leveled bedrock. De- fined in its latest phase by walls to the east and west, by the church to the north, and by steps to the south, this area may have functioned as an open piazza. A small structure was uncovered across from the main entrance to the church, the function of which is not yet clear. The exterior of the building measures ca. 5 X 2.5 m. It is divided into two parts: to the east is an entry hall leading to a very narrow doorway. From that doorway one enters a room measuring only 1.5 X 1.6 m. The wall in the north of this room has a V- shaped slit "window." The eastern half of the room was originally paved with marble, of which only a few pieces remain. The western half of the room con- tains a "basin" measuring 0.9 X 0.5 m, preserved to a height of approximately 0.4 m. This feature is cer- tainly the focus of the building; however, its function is as yet unclear. Suggestions have been made that it was an ossuary or a water installation. A small wall separates the basin from the eastern part of the room. The eastern face of this wall is mar- ble and has a Greek inscription. The stone is 0.36 m high and was 0.89 m wide but was found broken into Fig. 23. Petra. North Ridge Project. (R. Mittelstaedt)</page><page sequence="27">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 511 two parts. On it are carved 10 lines of approximately 36 characters per line. The upper part of the inscrip- tion is poorly preserved, but the lower five lines are in good condition (fig. 23). It certainly mentions Palaestina Salutaris and also seems to mention "speakers of a barbarian tongue" and "fighting." It may be honoring a person, perhaps a soldier. The lower half was below the level of the marble floor to the east of the basin, possibly indicating that it was reused in this building. Petra Church Project. Pierre Bikai and Nazeh Fino, ACOR, report: In preparing to restore the opus sectile pavement of the church nave in the spring of 1998, removal of the original pavement mortar bedding revealed the line of the original church chancel. The chancel posts were wooden, as indicated by impressions in the mortar of their foundations. The chancel ex- tended to the third column from the apse, making it one of the deepest chancels known (fig. 24). Rem- nants of the nonfigurative mosaic previously uncov- ered near the apse were found just east of the chan- cel posts, indicating that the whole chancel was paved similarly. Petra Church Project, Petra papyri. R.W. Daniel, University of Michigan, and M. Lehtinen, Academy of Finland, report: The most significant single activity connected with the Petra papyri in 1998 was the digital imaging of all texts by Steve Booras and Gene Ware of Brigham Young University and the Center for the Preserva- tion of Ancient Religious Texts (CPART). The full set of photographs that had been made in 1994- 1995 remains indispensable for a record of the texts as they appeared immediately after conservation, but the new technology produces images of vastly superior quality, especially in difficult parts of the texts. The new technology consisted of multispectral computer-assisted digital imaging at close range. En- hanced images can be produced and, when neces- sary, the images taken at different light spectra can be combined to produce images with more detail than is visible under any single spectrum. The re- sults should greatly facilitate future decipherment and make it much less necessary to handle the frag- ile originals. The team from Provo (Utah) conducted test imaging of the papyri in Amman in January 1998, evaluated the results and established working proce- dures in Provo, and then carried out the entire imag- ing of 366 plates of papyri, of which 99 had writing on the back (thus, in effect, 465 plates), in 53 days of intensive work in Amman at the end of 1998. The University of Michigan team, led by L. Koenen, concentrated above all on the decipher- Fig. 24. Petra Church.

The Finnish team led byJ. Fr6sen continued to re- construct and decipher primarily inv. nos. 4 (a divi- sion of property, written in Gaza); 6a (a will or dona- tion of Obodianos); 9 (a sale of real property); 13, 14, and 17 (tax documents); 20 (a settlement of a debt between two families); 22 (a sale of real estate); 24 (a sales contract); 68 (similar to 63 and 65, see above); 69 (tax receipts and a list of stolen prop- erty); 72 and 79 (dealing with real estate); 83 (see AJA 101 [1997] 530-31); 84 (a registration of a sales contract); 86 (recto, a perpetual lease; verso, a donation); and 88 (dealing with an inheritance). Improved preliminary transcripts were prepared of the following documents of uncertain nature: inv. nos. 15, 29, 35, 36 and 37, 38, 39, 40, and 41. In addition these authors worked on inv. 98, a list of many toponyms, several identical with those in inv. 10. Roman Aqaba Project. S. Thomas Parker, North Carolina State University, reports: A fourth season of the Roman Aqaba Project took place in 1998 at the Roman port of Aila (Aelana), now within the modern city of Aqaba on the Red Sea. The objectives were to reconstruct the port's</page><page sequence="28">512 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M. BIKAI [AJA 103 Fig. 25. Roman Aqaba Project.

Cavanagh) economy and to conduct a regional survey and exca- vation of the ancient city. Founded by the Nabatae- ans in the first century B.C., Aila became a major in- ternational port where products were transferred between ships and caravans traveling between the Ro- man Empire and its eastern neighbors. The Romans annexed Nabataea in A.D. 106 and constructed the Via Nova Traiana to link southern Syria with the Red Sea. Aila was the southern terminus of this road. The survey focused on southeastern Wadi Araba, one of the city's principal access routes. This season another 101 archaeological sites were recorded by the survey, which has now recorded some 334 sites. The best represented periods are Chalcolithic, Early Bronze, Early Roman/Nabataean, and Late Roman. Excavation areas were widely scattered over the city. Some exposed more of several mudbrick com- plexes near the northern edge of the Nabataean city. One structure yielded a Late Roman jar filled with thousands of tiny fish bones, possibly used for storing garum, the ubiquitous fish sauce of antiquity. An an- cient dump yielded rich deposits of pottery, ceramic slag, kiln wasters, and charcoal, reflecting ceramic pro- duction in the Nabataean period. Two of the com- plexes were reoccupied after the Roman annexation and continued in use until the third or fourth cen- tury A.D. Farther south, excavation continued in a fourth century A.D. cemetery (fig. 25). Thus far 24 mud- brick tombs have been excavated, each with a single articulated skeleton. One tomb yielded a fragmen- tary bronze cross. The cemetery seems to be associ- ated with a massive mudbrick structure oriented eastwards, measuring 26 X 16 m, with a rectangular apse on its eastern end. Some walls supported arched doorways and vaults within the structure, and some were decorated with painted plaster. A stone stair- case suggests a second story. The building yielded many artifacts, including imported African Red Slip pottery, glass oil lamps, and over 200 coins. Two deep probes produced pottery and a coin of Dio- cletian (A.D. 284-305) that suggest construction in the late third or early fourth century. The eastward orientation and plan of the structure, the artifacts, and the associated cemetery all suggest that it was de- signed as a Christian basilica (fig. 26). A bishop of Aila is attested in 325. This church seems to be the earliest known in Jordan and is possibly the oldest structure in the world built as a church. It was destroyed in the late fourth century, possibly in the earthquake of 363. The southeastern portion of the church was subse- quently overbuilt by the Byzantine city wall in the late fourth or early fifth century. The wall has now been traced for over 120 m and in places still stands over 4 m high. Two rectangular interval towers project from the north face of the wall.</page><page sequence="29">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 513 Fig. 26. Roman Aqaba Project. View to the west of the mudbrick church at Aila. A segment of the later Byzantine city wall with its projecting tower is visible at the left of the photo. (K. Cavanagh) An area inside the Byzantine city wall has yielded a stratigraphic sequence of the fifth to tenth cen- turies A.D. Substantial stone and mudbrick struc- tures of the Umayyad period, laid out along a street running northeast to southwest, were found under Abbasid domestic structures. The street fol- lows the plan of the earlier Byzantine city. A frag- mentary Byzantine Greek inscription was found lin- ing a drain in an Umayyad building. The name "AILA" appears in the text, the first attestation from Aqaba itself of the ancient name. The deep Umayyad and Abbasid strata suggest that Byzantine Aila witnessed continued intensive occupation well into the Early Islamic period. Humeima. Rebecca M. Foote, Harvard University, John Peter Oleson, University of Victoria, and M. Barbara Reeves, SUNY-Buffalo, report: Excavations in 1998 at Humeima (ancient Hawar) focused on a Roman/Byzantine house and on the Abbasid qasr and mosque. In addition, a preliminary examination was carried out on a presumed Roman watchtower 1 km southeast of the site. Field E125 provided significant new information about Hawar in the centuries following the arrival of the Roman garrison. The team uncovered nine rooms of a house of mudbrick walls on stone foundations, with stone arches and roofing slabs. There were seven phases of occupation. During the initial phase (late second to early third centuries A.D.), the inte- rior walls of one room were decorated with frescoes depicting common Graeco-Roman motifs-the Muses (fig. 27) and other mythological figures, and a ped- estaled birdbath. In contrast, the other rooms at this time were either undecorated or decorated with sim- ple red bands and dots. All the wall decorations were either covered over with whitewash or removed dur- Z::Z i?riiiiiiiiiiii::i- ::~i ii !i~i iii~ iii:: ::::: :: : Fig. 27. Humeima. Fresco of the Muse Klio. (J.

At this same time, some walls were repaired and received new sur- faces consisting of large potsherds attached to the mudbrick with mud plaster. Pottery-faced and white- washed plaster walls often appear in the same room. The motivations for these inferior renova- tions are not clear, but the presence of seven pos- sible ballista balls in a fresco dump predating the renovations suggests that military action may have damaged the building. The chronology corre- sponds with Zenobia's revolt. In another cataclys- mic event in the late third century, the arches and walls collapsed. After a short period of abandon- ment, the building was again reused, but only in a very limited manner (e.g., a cooking area within part of the once-frescoed room). This final occupa- tion phase was brief and the building was aban- doned after more walls collapsed. The fifth season of excavation at the Abbasid fam- ily qasr/mosque complex revealed that the eighth- century qasr consists of two, closely successive phases of construction. The original block of rooms (ca. 52 X 42 m) surrounded a courtyard with an entrance on the east. During phase II, a ring of rooms was added around the exterior (61 X 50 m), and an en- trance was added on the south. A bakery discovered in the room in the northwest corner dates to the ini- tial phases, but most surviving occupational evidence dates from the later Fatimid and Ottoman periods of use: bins, door blockings, flagstone pavements, a mastaba (bench), and bronze objects. Excavation also revealed a puzzling, Early Byzantine wall extend- ing for 59 m under the southeast quadrant of the qasr and mosque. The hard silt layer covering the wall and its lack of incorporation into the qasr or mosque sug- gest that it was not visible when the early Islamic complex was built. The eighth-century "fresco room" produced more fragments of finely carved ivory panels in its deepest stratum, including three human figures (fig. 28) and various bird, vegetal, trefoil, and geometric designs. Two of the figures are in military attire; one is an ex- act mirror image of a figure found in 1995. Another warrior wears similar clothing but a different type of helmet. The style, particularly the faces of the hu- man figures, suggests a provenance east of the Euphra- tes, likely in or near northeast Iran, which was the base of the Abbasid armed forces in their mid-eighth century usurpation of the Caliphate. The presumed Roman watchtower in field A127 was found to be Byzantine in date, with Early Islamic and possibly Ottoman phases. Although the struc- ture may have been built as a watchtower, it resem- . . . .i: i:::: j:-: . %- L7i i :i-i- i i :: i: . ....{d ; . : :: : :, i  . .. . :::i~: -i{ .. . :: ..: .... {- ' .':: Fig. 28.

The team continued the program of site develop- ment, clearing excavation debris from the site and undertaking the consolidation of excavated struc- tures in the Roman fort. A major field season is planned for 2000. Tell el-Kharrar. Mohammad Waheeb, DAJ, reports: Excavations were undertaken at Tell el-Kharrar (fig. 29) to reconstruct phases of occupation in the area, to investigate the relationship between the tell and the Jordan River during the course of settlement history, and to study the architectural remains- which include churches, water installations, and other buildings-along the southern bank of the wadi and the adjacent area. Tell el-Kharrar is a small, low hill on the southeastern side of Wadi el-Kharrar about 2 km from the Jordan River. The top of the tell consists of white Lisan marl mixed with red-brown soil. Trees, grass, and an active spring surround the site on its northern, eastern, and western sides, which fall steeply to the wadi. The southern bank of the wadi provides a natural route from the tell to the Jordan River. An aqueduct dated to the Byzantine era, largely destroyed in later occupations, had previ-</page><page sequence="31">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 515 Fig. 29. Tell Kharrar ously been identified on the tell. The top of the hill has been occupied by a Greek Orthodox church from the 13th century onward. Excavations revealed the foundations of a wall and small rooms built directly on bedrock on the slope of the tell. As the site is steep, it is likely that the wall was built to protect and support the buildings erected above it. Sherds recovered from the wall excavations date to the Byzantine period. Three mosaic floors were recovered; one of them, on the northeastern edge of the tell, is associated with the Byzantine wall. The floor is decorated with white, red, and black tesserae, and a five-line Greek inscription in the cen- ter, which translates: "By the help of the grace of Christ our God the whole monastery was constructed in the time of Rhotorios, the most God-beloved pres- byter and Abbot. May God the savior give him mercy." Three cisterns were excavated on the northern and southern slopes of the tell, one with steps to al- low access, possibly for bathing. The archaeological evidence at Tell el-Kharrar indicates that the com- plex was a monastery as well as a memorial church. Monasteries of this type are found throughout Pales- tine, usually situated near pilgrim routes. The mon- astery of Tell el-Kharrar appears to have been built to provide services for pilgrims on their way from Jeru- salem to the site on the Jordan River traditionally as- sociated with the baptism ofJesus. Jabal Haroun. Jaakko Fr6sen, University of Hel- sinki, and Zbigniew T. Fiema, Dumbarton Oaks, report: The Finnish Jabal Haroun Project (FJHP) con- cluded an initial two-month season of archaeological exploration in the area ofJabal Haroun, a mountain ca. 5 km west of Petra. The primary goal of the project is to investigate the Byzantine and Early Is- lamic periods in Petra, as both periods are enigmatic and poorly known in the area. The main site of the fieldwork was a ruined architectural complex on a plateau about 70 m below the summit crowned by the Islamic shrine. Additionally, an intensive archae- ological survey was carried out in the environs of the mountain. The religious significance ofJabal Haroun derives from Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions that consider the mountain to be the burial place of Aaron, Moses' brother. The presence of a religious establishment on the mountain in the Nabataean pe- riod is known through the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus (first century A.D.) and also from Byzan- tine and Arab sources. Furthermore, one of the doc- uments (inv. 6a) from the Petra carbonized papyri dated to the sixth century A.D. mentions a "House of Our Lord High Priest Aaron," which confirms the veneration of Aaron in the Petra area during the Byz- antine period. It has been proposed that the ruins below the summit of the mountain are a Byzantine monastery containing a chapel. The site of the monastery (fig. 30), ca. 75 X 45 m, was intensively surveyed and mapped. Four excava- tion trenches were opened and revealed extensive occupation of the site, dated from the Nabataean through the Islamic period, with the Byzantine pe- riod being architecturally the best represented. Half of the apse of the chapel was fully excavated, reveal-</page><page sequence="32">516 VIRGINIA EGAN AND PATRICIA M. BIKAI [AJA 103 Fig. 30. Jabal Haroun.

In the center of the apse was a masonry pedestal, probably for an altar, that was empty inside and had proba- bly been used as a repository for liturgical accesso- ries or relics. An important epigraphic find from the apse area was a fragment of the edge of a marble orthostat containing at the end of the line four well- engraved Greek letters that read ]APfON, most prob- ably the name of Aaron. The major discovery was the remains of a large tripartite single-apsed basilica, ca. 24.2 x 14.2 m, located directly south of the chapel. The outline of half of the apse (fig. 31) was exposed in one trench. Another trench revealed the western- most portion of the south aisle of the church, with a secondary south-north wall dividing the church area into two equal parts. At least two major occupa- tional phases represented by the floor levels could be distinguished in the exposed part of the aisle. The archaeological survey of the environs of the mountain concentrated on its western side, includ- ing the Wadi al-Ruba'i, a major water catchment area. Numerous installations related to agriculture and wa- ter management-such as barrages, slope terraces, dams, and channels, as well as threshing floors, lime kilns, and probable burials and simple dwellings-- were all fully recorded. The collected lithic material indicates human presence in the area as early as the Upper Palaeolithic period, but the ceramics were overwhelmingly Nabataean and Byzantine. Simulta- neously, a detailed cartographic study of the moun- tain and its environs was conducted to improve the three-dimensional model developed by the FJHP. Cartographic techniques employed included tachy- metry, digital recording, and photogrammetry. In a preliminary assessment of the results, it is ap- parent that the site represents a Byzantine monastic establishment in connection with a major pilgrimage center, both related to the veneration of Aaron. At the same time, the survey results attest to a long-lasting, intensive agricultural land use, enhanced by extensive structures to collect and manage rainwater. There is little doubt that the Jabal Haroun area remained one of the major food supply areas for Petra during the Nabataean and Byzantine periods. Bioarchaeological investigations at Yasileh. Bryan Renfro, University of Arkansas, reports: Excavations at Yasileh were conducted in 1998 by Yarmouk University's Institute of Archaeology and Anthropology and the University of Arkansas (co- directorsJ. Rose and M. el-Najjar). Yasileh, 9 km east of Irbid, was occupied from the Late Roman to the beginning of the Islamic period (Z. al-Muheisen, An- nual of the Department of Antiquities ofJordan 35 [1991 ] 341-46). In 1988, excavations in the southern re- gion yielded 79 individuals from nine tombs (Z. al- Muheisen and M. el-Najar, Mu'tah ournal For Research and Studies. 9.2 [1994] 5-27). In 1998, 39 tombs were excavated: 20 from the north necropolis, 12 from the south necropolis, and 7 from the west necropolis. Twelve of the 39 tombs excavated were large tombs and included features such as multiple stone-cut graves, arches, and niches. Twelve were single burial chambers cut horizontally into the rock, nine were cut vertically, and six were shaft tombs. Human remains were found in 23 of the tombs. Preliminary laboratory analysis was con- ducted and indicates that the remains represent 79 individuals, although two tombs excavated in the</page><page sequence="33">1999] ARCHAEOLOGY IN JORDAN 517 Fig. 31.

Nearly all remains were fragmentary and disturbed, since the tombs had been reused and had been de- spoiled by grave robbers. Of 39 tombs, only one showed no sign of disturbance. Fifty-nine of the individuals were evaluated, but the poor condition of the bones made it difficult to assess age and sex. Preliminary analysis indicates that 40 were adults, 16 were children, and 3 were infants. Where it was possible to determine the sex, half were males and half were females. At least four cases of in- fection were documented, one clearly associated with trauma to the proximal radius. A 45- to 50-year- old female exhibited healed fractures on a left rib and the distal portion of the right radius. Two cases of childhood cribra orbitalia are reported, indicat- ing childhood malnutrition or parasitism. Skeletal analysis will continue for a more precise overall pic- ture of health. Artifacts were recovered from 18 of the 23 tombs containing human remains. The most common burial goods were items of personal adornment, such as bronze rings and bracelets, wooden hairpins, and gold foil earrings. Glassware was mostly fragmented, with the exception of two long-neck vases (fig. 32). Nails and wood fragments indicating the use of coffins were found in 10 tombs. The relationships between artifacts, mortuary variation, and skeletal attributes are being investigated. Gharandal (Arindela). Alan Walmsley, University of Sydney, reports: A second season at Gharandal, Byzantine Arindela, was undertaken between 16 May and 9 July 1998. Work focused on the continued excavation of the Byz- antine church (fig. 33, area A) and on new investiga- tions into a large double enclosure, south of the church and earlier in date, on the summit (area B). Excavations confirmed that the church is a single- apsed basilica with rooms flanking the apse. The apse was constructed of finely dressed masonry; its floor was raised one step in the portion beyond the east wall of the church. The sanctuary platform ex- tended deep into the nave and was approached by two steps; slots for sanctuary screens and posts are visible in the stonework. Extensive remains of floor mosaics are preserved along the north and west sec- tions of the sanctuary, and their arrangement sug- gests that an altar stood on the platform in front of the apse. A large base, constructed from two flat YASIL 36 TOM 004 LOC 4iiii AUG!~iiiiiii~ ............~i~~i~~i Fig. 32. Yasileh.

General plan of the early Byzantine church. stones, was discovered at the northwest corner of the sanctuary and exhibits three (of originally four) hexagonal sockets. These were intended to hold colonettes for a pulpit, as in the Petra church. The sanctuary was dismantled in the 9th-10th century, based on the ceramics. The body of the church was made level with a yellow soil, and stone dividing walls were constructed. Associated levels contained early handmade pottery: hard, unpainted thin-walled jars with a chaff temper and red-orange to light-brown faces and black cores. The type com- pares well with later 11th-century varieties from the Amman Citadel and Aylah/Aqaba. Later levels pro- duced the first painted handmade wares in a thick, bright-red paint. The decoration is linear, compris- ing wavy lines, dots, and droplets. This pottery com- pares well with Brown's 12th-century Shobak ware. Levels immediately above produced the first geomet- ric painted ware; the paint is still very red in color, however, and the fabric is similar to but thicker than the Shobak linear ware. This pottery would appear to be a precursor to Hand Made Geometric Painted Ware (HMGPW). Upper levels produced classic HMGPW, a type that appears to have had a very long life. The impressive remains of a double compound stand at the summit of the site.Judging from the ma- sonry, the compound dates from the later Nabataean or Early Roman period. Two adjoining 10 X 10 m squares (B/9 and B/11) were laid out to span the central common wall (fig. 34). In square B/9, a thick deposit of ash and dump was excavated. Four phases can be identified: 1) Child burials, datable to the re- cent past; 2) layers of dark gray ash and a harder yel- low organic material, from which considerable bone and pottery (HMGPW) was recovered; 3) the first ar- 0 0 meters AREA A N C300 C 4 D4 /B/ B/11I AREA B // Fig. 34.

In B/11, numerous walls of the rooms of a domestic complex were exposed. The rooms appear to have been areas for storage, processing, and preparation of food or feed. The pottery was consistently late, with HMGPW prevailing. On the east face of the common wall of the double compound, a stout engaged column was identified, and south of it was a blocked doorway 2.25 m wide. Deir'Ain'Abata and the Ghor es-Safi. Konstantinos D. Politis, British Museum, reports: After three intensive seasons of work, excavations at Deir 'Ain "Abata were concluded in 1998 with the complete exposure of the pilgrims' hostel in area M, the communal burial chamber in area K.II, and the reservoir in area A. Excavations in the reservoir re- vealed an internal water channel and three flights of intact stairs leading to the perfectly preserved plas- tered bottom. The surprising discovery in front of the reservoir of the main entrance to the south of the basilica, with well-preserved carved wooden door panels, altered the plan of the church (fig. 35). Exca- vations in the cave in area FIII were also concluded with the discovery of more MB II and EB I material, although it was decided not to dismantle any more of the Byzantine structures to reveal the rest of the Bronze Age occupations. Since 1992 it had became increasingly apparent to project participants that illicit excavations in the Ghor es-Safi were reaching an alarming level. The increase of arable land, due to improved irrigation techniques, meant that more private land in the Ghor es-Safi was needed for agriculture. This expansion encroached onto the archaeological grounds of the modern town, particularly in the neighborhoods of Khirbet Sheik "Isa, al-Naq', Tawahin es-Sukkar, and Oneza.

A number of informal ground surveys and interviews with the local inhabitants of Safi were conducted to identify specific archaeo- logical features and the finds coming from them (fig. 36). It was established early in these investiga- tions that much could be learned from the local peo- ple who had been finding ancient remains for de- cades during their routine agricultural activities. This source of information had not been tapped by schol- ars visiting the southern end of the Dead Sea before, and we found it very useful in identifying areas of an- cient occupation from different periods. The area of Oneza is between the Wadi al-Hasa and the modern Aqaba-Dead Sea highway. Two ar- eas have been identified as belonging to the Medi- eval Islamic settlement: Al Ameri and Birkat. Al-Naq', or al-Mashnaqa, is the neighborhood of Safi immedi- ately southeast of Wadi al-Hasa. It is here on the southern banks of the wadi that EB I and Byzantine period cemeteries have been found by tomb rob- bers. Tawahin es-Sukkar is a sugar factory dating to the 12th to 15th centuries A.D. During our investiga- tion, it was possible to distinguish a mill fed by two water channels and a refinery, all enclosed by an adobe brick wall. Medieval Zughar, which is known to have been a major commercial town, may have been the center for sugar production and may have given its name to the product. The agricultural field of Khirbet Sheik 'Isa is located immediately northwest of Tawahin es-Sukkar; together they con- stitute part of the same Byzantine and Medieval site. This has been referred to as the best possible candi- date for the ancient city of Zughar/Zoara. Careful observations were made of the tomb-</page><page sequence="36">520 V. EGAN AND P.M.
