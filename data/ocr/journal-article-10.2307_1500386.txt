<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Editing" Dharmaraj: Academic Genealogies of a Bengali Folk Deity1 FRANK J. KOROM It has rightly been said that theory, if not received at the door of an empirical discipline, comes in through the chimney like a ghost and upsets the furniture. But it is no less true that history, if not received at the door of a theoretical discipline dealing with the same set of phenomena, creeps into the cellar like a horde of mice and undermines the groundwork (Panofsky 1955: 22). Introduction Much recent scholarship in folkloristics (e.g., Abrahams 1993; Anttonen 1994; Bendix 1992; Fox 1987; Korom 1992a), anthropology (e.g., Appadurai 1988; Huber 1997; Linke 1990; Strathern 1987) and other related fields (Gill 1987; Pease 1991; Robbins 1990) has drawn attention to the need to embed the scholarly practices of our academic ancestors in particular strands of intertwined ideas in order to understand better the ways that individual theories develop out of concrete intellectual environments. These environments, often generated by the charisma or vision of unusually motivated thinkers, are never static, for they constantly resonate with the current events of the period in question. One must therefore situate such personalities in their broader social, political and ide- ological contexts in order to move away from the spurious concept of theory from nowhere (cf. Appadurai 1986). Doing so also allows us to unpack the latent agendas of the proponents of theories that no longer capture the minds of contemporary scholars. Uncovering more about why certain researchers conceptualized their subject matter in the way they did provides poignant clues to the past development of academic inquiry and, hopefully, signals directions for future investigation. Dan Ben-Amos had already pointed out more than two decades ago that disciplinary social and historical "...exploration has direct bearing upon the ideas and the- Western Folklore 56 (Winter, 1997):51- 77 51</page><page sequence="2">52 WESTERN FOLKLORE ories that we formulate" (1973:119), and Charles Briggs (1993) has more recently stated that the metadiscursive practices of researchers in the social and human sciences have the power to create chains of authority upon which our the- ories are then based.2 None of the ideas discussed above are particularly new, since the history of ideas and the sociology of knowledge are, after all, time-honored disciplines (cf. Bidney 1953; Kuhn 1970). But the above lines of reasoning clearly remind us of a continuing need to connect the temporal and spatial links in chains of thought, allowing us to unravel strands of ideas that lead to the construction of particular academic representations of the Other.3 The process of unlinking a chain of authority, however, is not simply a chronological one, for the episte- mological premise underlying the necessary methodology for such an exercise rests upon what Michel Foucault (1972) has termed an "archaeology of knowl- edge." Arjun Appadurai (1988) characterizes intellectual archaeology as the analysis of genealogies. Genealogies, as he warns us, are selective: ...Every genealogy is a choice among a virtually infinite set of genealogies that make up the problem of influence and source in intel- lectual history. Every idea ramifies indefinitely backward in time, and at each critical historical juncture, key ideas ramify indefinitely into their own horizontal, contemporary contexts (1988:40). Digging through the multiple striations of a complex line of reasoning must thus move both vertically and horizontally to reveal the many unpredictable connections that occur not only in chronological sequence but also in sometimes punctuated leaps through geographical space. This is especially true in colonial situations where indigenous scholars were being trained in the ethnological the- ories of the dominant culture. My purpose in this essay is to unravel one demarcated genealogy in the his- tory of folklore studies in India. The problem, however, is that the Other being constructed in this instance is not an individual, group or community; rather, I am interested in how a particular local deity in West Bengal, India, was constructed by a group of scholars working in a specific cultural climate of sociopolitical oppression during a critical period of time in colonial Bengal. Once having done this, I will suggest that we need to refocus our research attention, at least in part, on the voices of the subaltern classes (cf. O' Hanlon 1988; Spi- vak 1988),4 the people that should be remembered as the interdisciplinary study of culture expands into an unbounded, deterritorialized world without clearly defined borders (Basch, Glick Schiller and Blanc 1994).5 The deity I am specifically concerned about is generically named Dharmaraj (dharmaraj), the "king of dharma" (duty or law), a highly localized "folk" deity worshipped almost exclusively in West Bengal. He is also known by the</page><page sequence="3">"EDITING " DHARMARAJ 53 shorter version Dharma, but in local contexts he goes by a number of appella- tions, each known only to the specific group of people in any given village or area who "call" (dak) him by some particular name (nam). For this and other reasons, which I can not fully explicate here, Dharmaraj has developed over time as an elusive, aniconic deity about whom we know very little.6 Moreover, because he is not depicted in any specific anthropomorphic form, there has been a great deal of speculation concerning his origin, a topic to be dealt with at some length below. But because he is an anonymous king in the local pantheon, Dhar- maraj exists in a state of virtually unidentified "existential supremacy" (Robin- son 1980:54). The plurality of the deity's identity, alluded to above, has to do precisely with his otiose nature; that is, because he is often perceived to be absent from the human realm for most of the ritual year, some scholars have argued that the deity is "withdrawn until called" (ibid.:60).7 The seemingly ambiguous state of Dharmaraj's status has not, however, hin- dered his worship in rural Bengal; on the contrary, his hierarchical position was enhanced precisely because of his mysteriousness. In the medieval period of Bengali history, he was worshipped in a fairly broad area of eastern India, and long epic poems, generically termed mafigalkabyas (auspicous poems) and sub- generically known as dharmamahigals (auspicious Dharma), were written in his honor.8 His worship declined over time, however, due to the rise in popularity of other deities inhabiting more dominant roles in the classical Hindu pantheon.9 Today, his annual worship service (pajd), called gajan (thundering) in some areas, is confined to a core of three districts in West Bengal, as well as to iso- lated pockets in other parts of the province and its contiguous border areas. Although his worship and the ritual recitation of the texts written in his honor have declined considerably in postcolonial times, Dharmaraj still serves as an important religious figure for the predominantly rural population of Bengalis who worship him today. In addition, his paramount yet mysterious position in the local pantheon offered Bengali scholars a prime opportunity to connect him with an "invented" past (cf. Korom 1989). Witness, for example, the words of the eminent Bengali linguist and historian of literature Sukumar Sen: The cult of Dharma is the quintessence of the native [Bengali] culture, both spiritual (religious) and material....The legend about the origin of the cultivation of rice has insinuated itself into the grand ceremony (i.e., Gajan). Other native industries also, such as production of molasses, smelting of copper and iron etc., have not been overlooked. Thus in the elaborate Gajan ceremony we witness the slow emergence of early Ben- gali culture in its main aspects (1945:674). This sort of "nativism," I believe, led to a fascination with an obscure and rural deity who was rediscovered by an urban intelligentsia only to be refash-</page><page sequence="4">54 WESTERN FOLKLORE ioned to suit the specific religious and political needs of a people subjugated first by Muslims and then by Christians over the course of many centuries. Indeed, the rise of Dharmaraj pljaJ occurred in the fifteenth century, a criti- cal time in Bengali history termed the "dark ages" by S. Sen (1960:34-61), when Hindu Bengal reasserted itself in literature and ritual practice after two centuries of Muslim rule. Hundreds of years later, in the nineteenth century, Dharmaraj was singled out of the local pantheon for intense investigation by indigenous scholars searching desperately for an "authentic" Bengali identity during the lat- ter years of British domination. As we shall see, however, their quest for the roots of Dharmaraj did not necessarily prove his definitive origin, but it did allow an earnest group of scholars to construct an image of the deity through a process of what I call "critical editing." This chapter in the history of Bengali folklore and nationalism tells us much about the social and spiritual ethos of a people victimized by two long waves of colonization. Image Management Milan Kundera (1980:105) writes that the existence of multiple authors or identities can cause typological confusion in the minds of scholars by posing a threat to the hegemonic control and dissemination of knowledge, as has also recently been shown by Fox (1987) to be the case in the politics of represent- ing women in folklore by our academic ancestors. In an article titled "Kirttibas and the Pandits," William L. Smith (1981) describes how the popular Bengali Ramayana of Kritibas Ojha became transformed into a new and totally differ- ent text through the historical process of editing. Quoting a well-known Bengali authority, he states, "It would not be incorrect to say that those works which are sold under the name of Krttibas' Ramayana are completely independent of the original" (Smith 1981:229). He concludes his study by suggesting that "the Krttibasan tradition was a catch-all in which all sorts of popular elements found a place....This mass of Ramaya na material stamped with the name of Krttibqs, a summation of the Ramayana tradition in Bengal, is the result of five hundred years of growth and an unknown number of contributors, and in both form and authorship, the collective product of an entire culture" (Smith 1981:238). Indeed, the process of editing embodies the power to create not only new meanings but entirely new texts that are somehow perceived to be truer to the tradition in question than the original. Critiquing the philological methods employed by textual scholars in Indonesia, Mary Zurbuchen has stated: They have conceived their task to be the collection and "rescue" of as much material as possible, and the transferral of it into more durable form. These scholars have assumed that multiple versions of a text emanated</page><page sequence="5">"EDITING " DHARMARAJ 55 from a single original and ideally should be grouped together, analyzed, and collated, with any inconsistencies, ambiguities, lacunas, or other undesirable features eliminated. From this process would emerge a "purer" text resembling that of the "original" author-a text free from cor- ruption and errors that are the inevitable result of repeated transmission through copying. This work would then stand as a "critical edition," a solid basis on which any further linguistic and textual research could be founded (1987:4). Although it is not normatively conceived in a similar fashion, the doing of fieldwork also involves a certain degree of "critical editing" that manipulates, shapes and creates the object of ethnographic research, be it a human life, a god, or a cultural practice. In fact, it can even involve basing an argument on rumor alone (Gill 1988)."o This is especially true of a tradition that has a long scholarly history of inquiry, as does the question of Dharmaraj's identity. In the next section of this essay, I wish to unravel the curious history of the study of Dharmaraj in order to demonstrate how the scholarly "image" of the deity emerged as a contemporary edited version of a time-honored Bengali religious phenomenon. The resultant "edition" of Dharmaraj was managed, I argue, by Bengali scholars wishing to use him as an image of unity for a budding Bengali nationalistic identity. To accomplish this task, it is necessary to go back to the closing years of the nineteenth century when the deity was almost surrep- tiously brought to the attention of Indologists, anthropologists and folklorists for the first time. Scholarly Practice and the Making of a Deity In 1894 the noted Bengali Sanskritist and educator Haraprasad Shastri (1853-1931) published a brief report in the Proceedings of the Asiatic Society of Bengal (Shastri 1894) in which he suggested that the imagery, symbolism and worship of Dharmaraj bore very close resemblance to Buddhist notions of the sacred. Shastri published two more brief articles the following year to supple- ment his original data (Shastri 1895a, b), and continued to draw forceful parallels between Buddhism and Dharmaraj worship throughout a long and illustrious career that resulted in the publication of 317 monographs and articles, many of which referred to the Buddhist origins of Dharmaraj."1 The latter point is not sur- prising if we consider Shastri's overall dedication to the study of Buddhism in eastern India as the Secretary of the Buddhist Text and Research Society in Cal- cutta, a position he assumed in 1895. It is to his credit that a number of con- nections were made between seemingly disparate cultural phenomena in an attempt to create order out of a chaotic and fragmentary corpus of data. Although Shastri published on a wide range of issues, it is well-</page><page sequence="6">56 WESTERN FOLKLORE known that his interest in Buddhism superseded most of his other acad- emic research. Shastri's four trips to Nepal between 1897 and 1922 in search of new manuscripts for the Asiatic Society of Bengal yielded a huge body of information concerning the development and diffusion of Bud- dhism within India and beyond her borders to the north. So great was his collection of manuscripts that it led the eminent Indologist Moriz Win- ternitz to state that "among the numerous essays and original works in the field of Sanskrit literature..., his valuable contributions to our knowledge of Buddhist literature in Nepal and Tibet are perhaps the most important" (Winternitz 1933:1). Thus it seems that Shastri was most compelled towards Buddhist studies, and his pervasive knowledge of that field of study led to an unchallenged acceptance of his basic tenet that the worship of Dharmaraj was nothing more than a remnant of decaying Buddhism in Bengal.12 This sort of "devolutionary premise" is all too common in nineteenth-century scholarship worldwide, as Alan Dundes (1969) has taught us.13 Shastri's evidence was based primarily on textual material (e.g., equating the life of Lausen, the hero of the Dharmamangal corpus, with the life of the Bud- dha as depicted in an important text known as the Lalitavistara) supplemented with occasional forays into the field (leading to an equation of the eyed dhar- matild [dharma stone] with the eyed Buddhist st~ipa). These forays yielded scanty information at best.14 Yet even though his comparisons between Buddhism and Dharmaraj were mostly superficial, his devolutionary premise remained vir- tually unquestioned for nearly fifty years, as one observer has noted (Kil- patrick 1977:23). Why would a host of scholars simply accept Shastri's theory without contention? The answer most probably is related to the intellectual envi- ronment at the time that Shastri put forth his Buddhist hypothesis. S. Sen plausibly states: "Buddhistic studies just then had captured the fancy of Indian orientalists who were too ready to read Buddhism between lines in all matters old, unknown and mysterious. Shastri too could not overcome this weakness" (1945:670). Shastri's situation is not unique to India, for we know that the "discovery" of a tradition by scholars is often enmeshed in larger social processes and nation- alist movements. In her study of British ballad research, Susan Stewart has pointed out that the motivation to study a particular tradition can arise out of a sense of longing: ...A sense of distance between one era and another, one world-view and another; a sense of historical periodization, transformation, and even rupture....The tautology of discovery lay in its recovery of a national identity, a tracing back to a point of origin that would be the very land-</page><page sequence="7">"EDITING " DHARMARAJ 57 scape of the present....But all of this depended upon the invention of a his- torical rupture, a separation that would enable the 'discovery' (1990:136,137,138). She goes on to say that "it is equally difficult to preserve a domain of scholarship outside of these valorizations of historical modes; ...scholarship itself often arises out of a response to a crisis" (ibid.:138).15 As I have suggested above and argued more extensively elsewhere (Korom 1989:68-75), Bengal was experiencing such a crisis during the latter half of the nineteenth century. The crisis led to an accelerated search for essential components of the region's past. It was a time of cultural fragmentation after the Sepoy Rebellion of 1857 dur- ing which the British colonial administration wished to understand the variegated contours of Indian society better in order to rule more efficiently. Conse- quently, Bengalis-and to a lesser extent, Indians from other regions of the coun- try-started to reconstruct their own identities by rummaging through the past to find an "authentic" or "pure" culture and language free from the influ- ences of rapid urbanization and anglicization. This intensified search for a com- mon identity led to what historians have called the Bengali Renaissance (cf. Bharati 1970; Kopf 1969; Poddar 1970, 1977), a flourish of intellectual and nationalistic activity influenced by both indigenous thinking and Western scholastic trends. Shastri, in his role as educator, was very much involved in the nationalist movement, advocating the official use and standardization of the ver- nacular tongue over English (P. Sarkar 1978:319-344; S. Bandyopadhyay 1978:277-288). His efforts in this regard are quite commendable as a nationalist thinker, and were seen as such by his Bengali compatriots, but it seems to be the case that his emotional involvement in reclaiming Bengal's rightful heritage may have led him to posit an untenable hypothesis pertaining to Dharmaraj's iden- tity and origin. For nearly half a century, as Indian and European scholars were rediscovering Buddhism, the notion of a surviving remnant of this ancient religion enraptured investigators who were interested in the reconstruction of Bengal's "classical" past through a process of what has been recently referred to as the salvage par- adigm in the literature on ethnographic theory (Clifford 1983, 1989; Marcus and Cushman 1982).16 Interestingly enough, it was an anthropologist named K. P. Chattopadhyay who first questioned Shastri's hypothesis in 1942. Based on a field survey of numerous villages throughout Bengal, Chattopadhyay also noticed "a preponderance of tortoise-shaped stones" (Chattopadhyay 1942:105). But his field experiences led him to a series of varying and conflicting con- clusions. On the equation of the hero Lausen with the Buddha, for example, Chattopadhyay wrote that "the resemblance is not however very great and the similarity may be due to borrowing of details from one mythological tale by</page><page sequence="8">58 WESTERN FOLKLORE another, without the necessity of equating the Buddha with Dharma" (ibid.:131). Realizing that Shastri's evidence was mostly circumstantial, he further asserted that in equating the &amp;ila with a stipa one can just as easily infer a tortoise cult that was later absorbed into Buddhism (ibid.: 132). Chattopadhyay thus intro- duced the novel idea of pushing the origin of Dharmaraj back even farther into the past by equating Dharmaraj with the Vedic deity Varuna. His logic for doing so was that Varuna is implicated in earlier versions of the Raja Harishcandra story, which Sen estimated to be the oldest tale in the Dharmamangal literature (S. Sen 1975:138). Varuna is also associated with the sun, as is Dharmaraj in the Dharmamangal, a point to which I shall return below.17 Three years later Sen published an article in which he refuted Shastri's claims on the grounds that the latter had very little evidence, and even suggested that the influence may have gone in the other direction; that is, that Dharma worship influenced Buddhism (S. Sen 1945:671). Sen agreed with Chattopadhyay that the Dharma stones were tortoise-shaped and that Dharma could be equated with Varuna. However, he was convinced that the antiquity of Dharmaraj predated the Vedas: "It is...not unreasonable to hold that the cult in its most primitive form was brought in by Austric [tribal groups from the East] immigrants. The cult was later superimposed by Vedic and later Hindu religious ideas and practices" (ibid.:669). That same year the grammarian Suniti Kumar Chatterji independently proposed the Austric origin of Dharmaraj based on philological evidence, but was more cautious than his predecessors in discussing a mono- genetic theory of the deity's emergence. Chatterji was one of the first important spokesmen for the admixture theory. In 1945 he wrote, "...There has taken place in both Upper India and Bengal a commingling of cults, in both their ideals and theories and their practices and rituals...and this has led to a tangle...which it is well-nigh impossible to untie."'18 The most careful and extensive critique of Shastri was put forth by Shashib- husan Dasgupta in his 1946 book titled Obscure Religious Cults. Dasgupta argued that more than ninety percent of the Buddhist similarities found in the Dharmaraj complex belonged to religious systems other than Buddhism. (1976:264). Even though he was willing to subscribe to the idea that the dharma stone was vaguely shaped like a tortoise, and agreeing with S. Sen that this could have been related to a "primitive" sun god in the past (ibid.: 291),19 he was not inclined to accept the &amp;ild Istdpa equation. Instead, he became the definitive spokesman for the admixture theory with the following oft-quoted pas- sage: "The Dharma cult is the result of a popular commingling of a host of het- erogeneous beliefs and practices; it will therefore be incorrect to style it purely Buddhistic or Hindu or indigenous either in origin or in nature,-it is as much a hotch-potch in its origin as it is in its developed form and nature."20 But we</page><page sequence="9">"EDITING " DHARMARAJ 59 must be cautious not to equate the researcher's lack of understanding with the phenomenon being studied. As Dundes reminds us, "It is always risky to call a tradition 'more or less confused'. More often, it is the would-be analyst of myth who is more or less confused!" (1986: 364). This is an important point to be explored below. The 1950s witnessed the emergence of a prolific Bengali scholar named Asu- tosh Bhattacharyya, whose background in both literature and anthropology enabled him to continue the debate concerning Dharmaraj from both a textual and contextual point of view. In his earliest articles on the subject, Bhat- tacharyya (1952, 1953) praised Shastri for bringing the Dharmaraj phenomenon to the attention of scholars but correctly observed that the various opinions put forth by researchers might apply to a specific location without producing a gen- erative model for the whole area in which Dharmaraj is worshipped. His view on the tortoise-shaped stones that represent the deity, an important item discussed by each of our investigators in the past, was that most of the contemporary Silas are not shaped like a tortoise at all (A. Bhattacharyya 1952:119). He also dis- agreed with Chatterji's philological evidence tracing the appellation Dharma back to a similar sounding Austric word.21 He wrote: Dharma Thakur [= Dharmaraj] came to be associated with the tortoise at a much later date...when the the idea of the deity came under the influence of the Hindu Puranas" (A. Bhattacharyya 1953:359). Bhattacharyya did not attempt to refute the Austric origin of the deity by dis- agreeing with Chatterji, but he did come to the conclusion that there must have been a "primitive" sun cult spread across much of northeastern India in pre- Aryan times. Utilizing a wealth of comparative, albeit fragmentary, literary and ethnographic evidence, Bhattacharyya developed a taxonomy of features for a prototypical high god in the spirit of Wilhelm Schmidt's The Origin and Growth of Religion (1931). This allowed him to postulate his own survival the- ory of a pan-tribal solar deity that gradually became incorporated into the Hindu folk pantheon in Bengal because of the diffusionistic traits he was able to map. Bhattacharyya adhered to this theory for the remainder of his life, con- tinuing to add clues whenever and wherever he found them. Thus his sun god hypothesis was fully developed in the magnum opus, BJtfgla Mai~gal Kabyer Itihas ("The History of Bengali Mangal Kabyas" Bhattacharyya 1975:670-693), and appeared as a major component in one of his last publica- tions (Bhattacharyya 1977). Scholars in the 1960s (R. M. Sarkar 1965) and 1970s (B. Bhattacharya 1971; Mahapatra 1972a, b, c; Maity 1971; Mitra n.d.; 1972) continued to discuss the tortoise-shaped stones and the tribal origins of Dharmaraj, but were more inclined to adhere to an evolutionary model of the admixture theory proposed</page><page sequence="10">60 WESTERN FOLKLORE by Chatterji and Dasgupta. In the words of Bholanath Bhattacharya, for exam- ple, "The character, appearance and nomenclature of Dharma Thakur vary from place to place, depending on the local proportion of the admixture of the assorted ingredients that have gone into the making of this godhead" (1971:244). He envisioned the godhead as a "confused blending" that resulted in a three-fold process of development: 1) a magico-religious faith prevailing in the primordial society of Bengal, 2) a folk god that became transmuted into a throroughly Bud- dhist deity, and 3) conversion into a Puranic deity at a still later juncture (ibid.: 240).22 Even more recently, Sandra Robinson (1980) has referred to the "syncretic amalgamations" of Dharmaraj in her extensive comparative study. Robinson is correct in pointing out that none of the origin theories of the deity can be absolute (ibid.:7), and her comments on "syncretism" should be taken as a pos- itive portrayal of Dharmaraj. But even though she discusses some of the con- temporary rituals associated with Dharmaraj as a "nexus of a coherent theology and spiritual methodology" (ibid.:103), her assumptions only reinforce the notion of what we might call a creative eclecticism operating within the religious community. Her alternative of attempting a reconstruction of Dharmaraj on the basis of incomplete comparative data, supplemented by Amalendu Mitra's nearly comprehensive monograph (1972),23 ultimately lends to the editing process which I mentioned above by resulting in a composite definition of the deity. Rahul Peter Das (1983, 1987) has also discussed the heterogeneous nature of Dharmaraj. His interpretation of the deity as simply a manifestation of the pan- Hindu principal of dharma24 parallels a much earlier statement by S. C. Roy (1937: 331-332) concerning the supreme deity of the Indian tribal group known as the Kharias, and is more plausible: "...Dharma is, after all, that which regulates everything. It is possible that this is the case as regards the Bengali Dharma too, which does not hinder the god from having all the other charac- teristics described above, i.e., from being of composite nature" (1983:684). His insistence on the "composite nature" of Dharma, however, strongly reminds us of the process of creating critical editions. Das bases his conclusions on a vast array of textual, philological and anthropological sources. As erudite as his work may be, does not the process of sorting out the puzzle with various stray ref- erences lead us into the same speculative quagmire faced by the textualist work- ing on a critical edition? I would argue that it does, but I do not wish to suggest that such an approach is without value, for areal studies of so-called regional Hindu "cults" in India have been productive in some cases (cf. Biardeau 1989; Hiltebeitel 1991; Sontheimer 1974). There is, however, also a sustained need to continue studying local religious</page><page sequence="11">"EDITING " DHARMARAJ 61 movements from within one community in question and move outward. Resem- blance does not necessarily mean equivalence. It could very well be the case that any self-contained religious system operates within its own set of logical para- meters, and in order to move onto comparisons even within one seemingly uni- fied tradition, we must first understand how the local system operates within one community. For this reason, I disagree with R. M. Sarkar (1985: Introduction) when he states that one cannot understand a religious tradition without study- ing a cluster of sites where a phenomenon is manifest.25 His admirable attempt to study Dharmaraj worship in six communities leads to some interesting insights, but we still do not get a clear picture of the total belief system in any of his target villages. His study leaves us, once again, with uncertain conclusions and a composite image of the deity. With the exception of Asutosh Bhattacharyya, who is unique in this regard for attempting to balance field inquiries with textual scrutiny, researchers who have been involved in the discovery, identification and interpretation of Dhar- maraj can be divided into two camps: literary (S. K. Chatterji, R. P. Das, Dasgupta, S. Sen, Shastri) and anthropological (B. Bhattacharya, Chattopadhyay, Mitra, Robinson, R. M. Sarkar). This situation is not unlike the scenario in the history of American folklore studies. Two historians of folklore (Bronner 1986; Zumwalt 1988) have recently attempted to demonstrate a basic dichotomy between a "textual" and "contextual" school of folklore research in America. Bronner, for example, has suggested that an interest in the origins of any item of study was solely the concern of anthropological folklorists (Bronner 1986:15ff). But as a number of reviewers were quick to point out after the release of their respective books, the actual schism and theoretical/method- ological faction was never as clear cut as they have suggested (Farrer 1988; Georges 1989; Vorpagel 1988). The same counter-argument holds true for the history of Bengali folklore studies generally (Siddique 1966) and research on Dharmaraj specifically. Although not all of the figures mentioned above were successful in balancing their ethnographic and literary research, most at least attempted to complement one mode of inquiry with the other. One issue that provided a unified concern for all of them, however, was the search for origins, a point, we may recall, which Bronner suggested to be a divisive factor in the American context.26 This obsession must be situated in the intellectual constellation of late nineteenth-cen- tury anthropology, a time when Indian researchers were very much influenced by British ethnological practice in India.27 Further, we need to understand that the academic community involved in the "discovery" and interpetation of Dharmaraj created a cultural text of the deity that did not exist prior to their interpretive enterprises. In essence, they created an accepted data bank for schol-</page><page sequence="12">62 WESTERN FOLKLORE arly debate because their studies were given the acknowledged status of author- itative documents by colleagues and critics who accepted their propositions as tantalizing or adequate. The composite Dharmaraj, then, as he was conceived by these scholars, did not exist in reality, but only in the "discourse of theory" (Velcid 1989:7) within which their scholarly debates took place. The real con- text of their fieldwork was, for the most part, the lively discussions and rejoin- ders generated by the interpretive processes in which they were engaged. As such, these scholars unknowingly were enmeshed in a process of what can be termed "cultural complicity."28 The need to provide an explanation of Dharmaraj's origins inevitably resulted in an interdisciplinary search for the "real" and "pure" Dharmaraj. Due to lack of evidence, the only way for researchers to complete this task was to engage in the process of "critical editing" that I have described above. In other words, Shastri and his successors had no alternative but to come up with a composite image of the deity by emphasizing the "syncretic" nature of Dharmaraj and his worship. It will be useful to take up briefly the issue of syn- cretism here before proceeding with my discussion to suggest that the concept does not contribute to our understanding of Dharmaraj, and may, in fact, hinder any attempt to imagine his powerful presence in Bengali village life. Mixing, Matching and Synthesizing Umberto Eco's fictional dialogue in his historical and speculative novel Fou- cault's Pendulum suggests that virtually everything is the summation of a process of mixing and blending when he notes that "purity is a luxury" (1990:182). This is certainly true, but the term "syncretism" has been prob- lematized over the years by scholars in a host of disciplines wishing for clearer categories of analysis. The recent trend in the use of the term hybridity to refer to the mixing of cultural components (e.g., Bhabha 1994; Garcia-Canclini 1989; Kapchan 1993; Pieterse 1995) may have something to do with the ques- tionable nature of the term syncretism. The latter is inherently ambiguous, and because it is rarely defined by those who use it, it appears as a reification in a number of conflicting contexts. Applying "syncretism" to the Dharmaraj tra- dition(s) is also stretching the usefulness of the idea as a religious phenomenon, since syncretism by definition means an "attempted union or reconciliation of diverse or opposite tenets or practices" (OED 2:3, 210).29 The word "attempted" is important here, for it suggests an incompleteness of doctrine and practice. In addition, the issue of agency is raised here, since an attempt to reconcile mutually opposed tenets implies human causality.3 One could therefore ask why a successful, coherent syncretism did not occur in Dharmaraj's case. The answer is certainly to be located in the conscious attempts of local communities</page><page sequence="13">"EDITING " DHARMARAJ 63 to construct a systematic and comprehensive theology for the deity to suit the needs of their own local environments. The worship of Dharmaraj in rural Ben- gal does not lack coherency in its plurality, as I shall suggest below. On the con- trary, it is a total system of religious action that can only be understood through close investigation on the microethnographic level.31 The dictionary definition of syncretism also suggests an inconsistency because the "attempted union" can only be brought to fruition as a result of an alteration of conflicting points of view. In the words of Robert Baird, "Syn- cretism occurs only when the result [of an encounter of religions] is not a har- monious unity" (1971: 147). As will be clear later in my argument, the devotees of Dharmaraj in specific contexts do not see their belief system as inconsistent or out of harmony. Although the writings of the scholars whose words I quoted above would lead us to believe that the Dharmaraj tradition is a confused hotch-potch, my data from Goalpara, an all-Hindu village located in Birbhum District, West Bengal, suggest something quite the opposite (cf. Korom 1992b). The emphasis on tradition (sampraday), uniformity and orthopraxy in the Goalpara worldview suggests a coherent and consistent philosophy of the common person that elevates the study of "quaint superstitions and practices" to the sophisticated level of Geisteswissenschaft (L. Schmidt 1947). It is a model of worship based primarily on practical religion, not abstract concepts of spec- ulative thought.32 Since there is no insider's view of inconsistency, there can be no admittance of syncretism by believers. Viewed historically, one could argue that the overarching Dharmaraj tradition was a result of many religious streams, or at least influences, converging at some point in the past, which does not pre- clude some degree of borrowing or sharing of interacting belief systems. Indeed, a century of scholars have pursued this line of thought. But this is not saying much more than there are interacting forces in any cultural encounter. In this case, syncretism amounts to nothing more than historical interrelationships, something that is universal and inevitable, as Baird has argued, for it is "merely a term used to describe a dictum of historical knowledge-any subject fitting for historical research has historical antecedents" (1971:145). In the last analysis the term syncretism does not tend to edify and can only act as a theoretical barrier to any sort of valid understanding of the Dharmaraj phenomenon. An alternative and adequately reflexive approach to account for the histor- ical interrelationships apparent in the Dharmaraj phenomenon would be to dis- cuss the deity and his worship as an emergent process; a "cumulative tradition" (W. C. Smith 1978:154-169) actualizing itself. Wilfred Cantwell Smith defines this as "the entire mass of overt objective data that constitute the historical deposit, as it were, of the past religious life of the community in question...any- thing that can be and is transmitted from one person, one generation, to</page><page sequence="14">64 WESTERN FOLKLORE another, and that an historian can observe" (1978:156-157). The cumulative tra- dition is historically intelligible and objective, but neither inflexible nor final in either content or form. Smith admits that this can and should be empirically known. But the question remains one of scale, as practitioners of discourse analysis have taught us (Brown and Yule 1983: 58ff). How large or small a com- munity or tradition do we need to demarcate in order to make sense of local belief systems? If, as Smith would argue, the larger societal level can only be formulated through individuals' belief systems, then the cumulative tradition must be grounded in personal faith. Individual faith is the direct link with the tran- scendent; in this case Dharmaraj. But can an observer really know someone else's faith? From a purely epistemological point of view it is an impossibility because the investigator, no matter how empathetic and subjective she or he may be, can never enter the mind of the believer. This is a position well-known to anthropologists (Geertz 1983:55-72) and to philosophers (Gadamer 1975). We can never hope to achieve an ideal epochS, and therefore someone else's faith is difficult, if not impossible, to delineate or verbalize. Yet because faith is the foundation of the cumulative tradition, according to Smith, it must be put into perspective. Faith constantly feeds cumulative tradition, but it also depends on the tradition for expression. Stating it plainly, they are interdependent; two agents in a dialectical process. Since people express faith within the context of a cumu- lative tradition, it logically follows that Smith understands human beings as mediators between mundane/societal concerns and transcendent/personal ones.33 Without ignoring what the Dharmamangal texts have to say, it is on the level of individual human beings that I wish to proceed with my discussion, utilizing the words and beliefs of actual people; people who are constantly in touch with Dharmaraj through their actions and behaviors. With the exception of Robinson's (1980) study, whose concerns somewhat parallel my own, none of the investi- gators mentioned above ever made clear and specific references to the ideas and opinions of the folk involved in the worship of Dharmaraj. Yet the people who believe in and worship Dharmaraj are, in essence, the bearers of the tradition because their exegesis canonizes the tradition in the immediate environment (Korom 1996; cf. also Brown 1994:55-111). They are the ones who give the ani- conic deity his manifest presence. As Robinson writes, "Dharma requires his devotees to complete him as a deity. He is activated through their interactions with him; they realize and actualize the god. They lend form to the Formless one" (1980:71). My approach, to be taken up in a subsequent issue of Western Folklore, diverges from Robinson's, however, by focusing on the tradition as it is actualized in one location.</page><page sequence="15">"EDITING " DHARMARAJ 65 Conclusion in limine It is not uncommon for people in various regions of India to speak of a par- ticular genre or performance tradition as "ours" as opposed to "theirs" (Flueck- iger 1991:182-192). This insider/outsider distinction is important and well-known in the general literature on folklore (Jansen 1959) and is implicated in the Dhar- maraj tradition as well. When the residents of Goalpara speak of a particular rite associated with Dharmaraj in their village context, they most often express the uniqueness of their practices even within the broader tradition. Thus it is not uncommon to hear such statements as "We do [it] like this" (amra iye kari ), or "They do [it] like that" (ord oi rakam kare). It is important to keep such indigenous classificatory distinctions in mind even when we are dealing with a broader, more engulfing tradition. The general consensus of the people of Goalpara is that there is a distinct sense of multiple Dharmaraj traditions. It may thus be useful to discuss the image of Dharmaraj in the plural. Just as Jonathan Z. Smith (1990) has brilliantly shown that we must speak of early Christianity in the plural, so too must we dis- cuss Dharmaraj traditions as a number of freely associated, yet independent, sets of practices and beliefs.34 In order to do this it will be necessary to move away from the essentialist position held by most of the scholars discussed above, and lean in the direction of studying the Dharmaraj tradition in its numerous emer- gent contexts. By essentialism here I mean the phenomenological bracketing of qualities or characteristics to create a composite image of the deity.35 Describ- ing the image of Dharmaraj in specific local contexts would allow us better means of comparison for understanding the pan-Bengali nature of the deity because it would guard against the temptation to pick and choose data to fit a predetermined etic model. Returning to the local to analyze the Dharmaraj phe- nomenon would thus add one more critical complex of associations to the over- all scholarly imaginings of the traditions associated with the deity.36 Museum of International Folk Art Santa Fe, New Mexico</page><page sequence="16">66 WESTERN FOLKLORE Notes 1 The present article is an expansion of a line of argumentation first initiated in chapter one of my doctoral dissertation (cf. Korom 1992b: 14-36). The research upon which this paper is based was generously funded by a grant from the American Institute of Indian Studies in 1988-89 and a Fulbright-Hays Dissertation Research Grant in 1990. The Ford Foundation brought me back to the field at a crucial moment in 1991. While in resi- dence at the University of Pennsylvania during the 1991-92 academic year, writing was sponsored by a predoctoral grant from the Mellon Foundation. I wish to thank my com- mittee members for their initial feedback: Arjun Appadurai, Dan Ben-Amos, Peter Gaeffke and Margaret Mills. I also thank Rahul Peter Das, Joyce Ice, William L. Smith, Peter Tokofsky and two anonymous readers for their suggestions on subsequent drafts. My greatest supporter and critic, Abhijit Ghosh, deserves a special note of recog- nition for his tolerance. Portions of this paper were read at Williams College as "Critical Editions and the Ethnography of Religion" in January 1992, and at the Uni- versity of Lethbridge in July 1992 under the title of "Who is Dharmaraj?: Pluralistic Traditions in Local Hinduism." The present version was first read at the Nordic Institute of Asian Studies in Copenhagen, November 1996. I thank everyone in attendance at those sessions as well. Any errors in facts or interpretations are my sole responsibility. 2 Here, he is following a line of argumentation initiated by Foucault (1980). The Other need not necessarily be an exotic community far from our own native shores, for in the case explored below, the focus of investigation is part of the investigators' own cultural milieu, albeit from a more rural class. 4 Pandey (1995:223ff) discusses the fragmentary nature of writing subaltern history. In the case discussed below, fragmentation is certainly an important element to be con- sidered in the reconstruction of a particularly mysterious figure, since the information about him is extremely limited and tentative. In addition, as will become apparent as I proceed, the people closest to the deity in question are predominantly low-caste devo- tees; in other words, the subaltern members of Bengali society. 5 This will be my task in a sequel article to be published in a forthcoming issue of West- ern Folklore. 6 For a more complete discussion of the many contexts of Dharmaraj and his worship, see K. Bhattacharya 1986; Das 1983, 1987; Korom 1992b, 1996, 1997c; Mitra 1972; Robinson 1980 and Rohner and Chaki-Sirkar 1988. 7 Judging from the personal experience narratives told by Bengali villagers about Dharmaraj's constant and unpredictable appearance in local affairs (cf. Korom 1997c), I have elsewhere argued, and continue to do so below, that Robinson's claim is unwarranted. See Korom 1992b:83-144, esp.143. 8 Mahigalkirbyas form the bulk of medieval Bengali poetry (Zbavitel 1976:156). They are basically a corpus of epic poems written in a panegyric fashion for local Bengali deities. Each popular deity had his or her own sub-genre of marigalkibya, which would be sung or recited in royal courts by professional singers, as well as in villages by itinerant bards. Dharmaraj, being the "king" of the Bengali pantheon, had a considerable number of texts written in his honor over a span of almost 700 years. See Korom</page><page sequence="17">"EDITING " DHARMARAJ 67 1992b:1-6. On matngalkabyas in general, see A. Bandopadhyay 1980; Bhattacharyya 1943, 1975. 9 In fact, one theory concerning the decline of Dharmaraj's worship suggests that the process of "sanskritization" (Staal 1963), the absorption of local deities into the classical Hindu pantheon, led to Dharmaraj's blending of identities. Most often, he is thought to have achieved anonymity as he became incorporated into the worship of the Sanskritic god Shiva (cf. Hiltebeitel 1991:183-207; R.C. Sen 1833). Ost6r's (1980: 31- 32, 199-200) study deals with Shiva's gajan (festival) most extensively, suggesting close structural parallels to Dharmaraj's worship. But as I have insisted elsewhere (Korom 1996:16), many people in Birbhum District, W.B., do not accept that they are identical. 10 The notion of fieldwork-based ethnography as a creative act of the interpreter was for- mulated in a slightly different manner a few years earlier by James Clifford in his asser- tion of the fictional or unreal nature of ethnographic writing. See Clifford and Marcus 1986:5-6. 11 For a complete list of Shastri's publications, see Law 1933: 307-416. 12 Among Shastri's more notable followers in this regard were D. C. Sen (1911:26-30) and B. K. Sarkar (1972:184-201). 13 See Dundes 1969: 5-19. But see also the objections raised to the use of this term in Oring 1975:36-44. For a discussion, see Claus and Korom 1991:46-73. 14 In light of his writings concerning the Dharmaraj tradition, it does not seem that Shas- tri conducted much fieldwork, even though he advocated the use of participant observation and interview techniques in the study of folklore. See T. Cattopadhyay (1978:357). 15 Stewart is here arguing along the lines virtually canonized by Kuhn (1970:52-91). Kommerel (1932/33:3) makes a similar observation about German materials when he argues that because folk song is a concept, it is an invention, and by way of logical analogy, Herder did not just invent the concept of folk song, but the folk song itself. See also the discussion in Kvideland (1983:178). Hayden White further supports the idea of inventing a field of study when he states that the "making" of a domain of inquiry is a poetic act. See White 1982:252. 16 As Marcus and Fischer (1986:24) state, " The cultures of world peoples need to be con- stantly rediscovered as these peoples reinvent them in changing historical circum- stances, especially at a time when confident metanarratives or paradigms are lacking...." 17 The references are numerous. See, for example, Cakrabartti 1962:166. The passage reads: niraiijan caran siraj kare dhyan Meditating on the feet of Niranjan [and] the sun There is no evidence in the literature, however, that Max Miller's solar mythology hypothesis influenced the sun god advocates. For the background to this debate, see Dorson 1955. 8 S. K. Chatterji 1945:75. But Shashibhusan Dasgupta had already presented the idea in his Ph.D. dissertation submitted to the University of Calcutta in 1940.</page><page sequence="18">68 WESTERN FOLKLORE 19 But in one of his early articles A. Bhattacharyya, writing in 1952, stated: "Most of the Dharma-slabs that are seen to-day, however, are not tortoise shaped..." (1952:119). 20 Dasgupta 1976:260. Also quoted by Kilpatrick (1977:31) and Maity (1971:81). This notion was recently orally reformulated by Amalendu Mitra (personal communication Jan 1990): ei sampradda hach pach kare cale eseche. This lineage has come down as a hotch-potch. 21 Chatterji suggested that the pre-Aryan word for tortoise dur, most likely derived from the Kol language, must have been the origin for the New Bengali word durd or duro, leading to a Sanskritization in the following manner: durom, duram, daram, darom, dharma (S. K. Chatterji 1945: 80). Although this is a plausible linguistic recon- struction, it seems equally valid to simply accept the generic term dharma as an over- arching title for the deity, as Das (1983:684) has proposed. 22 Such evolutionary accounts seem to suggest that autochthony equals authenticity. The obsession with origins is apparent in P.K. Mahapatra as well: "The origin of the Dharma cult is traceable in the primitive beliefs, superstitions, customs and ceremonies of the folk people of this area. The materials essential in Dharma worship, the votive offerings in worshipping the deity, the rites and rituals performed in worship, the meth- ods of ceremonies, the magico-religious beliefs and socio-religious customs-all these characterise the Dharma cult as a primitive folk cult of Bengal" (Mahapatra 1972a: 41-42). His version of the evolutionary process, however, follows K. P. Chat- topadhyay 1942 and A. Bhattacharyya 1952 and 1953, when he equates Dharma with Varuna, who then became associated with the sun via the so-called tortoise cult (cf. Mahapatra 1972a:49-50). 23 Mitra's volume provides valuable data for the district of Birbhum, in which Goalpara, the village of my study, is located. It must be used with extreme caution, however. See the lengthy review article by Das (1983). 2 The term has a long history in Indian philosophy and religion, and its numerous mean- ings have constantly changed over time. For a succinct overview, see Halbfass 1988:310-348. 25 See also the criticisms raised by K. Bhattacharya (1987). 26 For a recent and thoughtful analysis of the logic underlying the scholarly quest for the origin of religion, see Masuzawa 1993. 27 As early as 1891 George Laurence Gomme, a member of The Folk-Lore Society in London, called for more intense ethnological research in India to shed light on the ori- gins of pagan social organization, religion and economics in the British Isles (Dorson 1968: 226). This is not the place to discuss the general European fascination with India and its ramifications in the study of folklore, but an historical overview of the issue can be found in Korom 1991. 28 By this, I do not intend to suggest anything categorically pejorative; rather complic- ity here should be understood in Abrahams' sense as a process acknowledging that "achieving license and carrying out licit activities is a conventionally cued achieve- ment" (1986:227). 29 In its special sense, syncretism refers to the seventeenth-century school founded by George Calixtus, who aimed at harmonizing the sects of Protestantism and ulti-</page><page sequence="19">"EDITING " DHARMARAJ 69 mately all Christianity. For a general methodological critique of the term, see the dis- cussion by Baird (1971:142-154). See also the specific objection to the term's use in the case of the neo-Confucian thinker Hu Chih in Taylor 1982. The definitional articles by Pannikar (1975) and Segert (1975) are also useful. For a contemporary, but problematic, treatment of the issue in the Bengali context, see Roy 1983. 30 1 wish to thank Peter Tokofsky for bringing this point to my attention. The issue of agency is one that has been curiously lacking in Indological studies, as Inden (1990:7- 48) has argued. However, see the specific critiques of Ahmad 1991. 31 This approach, however, has recently been questioned by folklorists who criticize the micro-sociological premise on the grounds that it does not allow us to connect micro concerns with macro ones because we become too enmeshed in minutiae (Lim6n and Young 1986:445-446). But the broader context creates its own sort of problems because it is really not certain how large a context must be to concretize a specific per- formance or event (Hanks 1989:110). A number of recent scholars have begun to "rethink context " (Bauman and Briggs 1990; Ben-Amos 1993; Goodwin and Duranti 1992; Silverstein 1992) in order to hone the concept's analytical usefulness. These and other works suggest that the whole movement in performance studies seems to be mov- ing away from microstudies to ever-larger contexts of expressive activities. But in my opinion, the need for closely detailed studies of small-scale phenomena should not be overlooked as contextual frames become expanded and transnationalized, for we might forget James Deetz's dictum, "in small things forgotten" (1977). Moreover, by ignoring small details in favor of broad comparative models, we run the risk of losing sight of our host community's specific perspectives. 32 1 use the phrase "practical religion" in a somewhat different sense from that intended by Leach (1968). Leach coined the term to mean something similar to Levi-Strauss' notion of sauvage. Leach feels that interpreting everyday religion according to canons and doctrine can be misleading. True enough, but his insistence that theolog- ical philosophy is preoccupied with the afterlife while practical religion is obsessed with the existential present is too simplistic. To rob the average worshipper of the ability to have eschatological concerns is unacceptable, especially in the light of the fact that Hin- dus do, in fact, speculate a great deal about the afterlife on the folk level. See Black- burn 1985. More acceptable in the South Asian context is Mandelbaum's distinction between transcendental and pragmatic complexes: "One is ultimate, supernal, derived from Sanskrit texts; the other is proximate, local, validated by vernacular tales" (Mandelbaum 1964:10). In the final analysis, I simply prefer to drop all classifiers from the term religion. On the problem of defining levels and kinds of religion, see Bell 1989; Davis 1974, 1982; O'Neil 1986; Primiano 1995; Yoder 1974. 33 One of Smith's basic arguments here is that between insider and outsider. His argument parallels the emic/etic debate in the social sciences. Learning from that example, we can see that tending towards absolute "emicness" or sheer subjectivity posits a com- pletely relativistic point of view that cannot be grounded in any type of method at all. On the pitfalls and solutions to this problem in the broad context of Eastern religions, see Goth6ni 1981. However, I would argue that it is possible to retain the basic con- cept of cumulative tradition as a heuristic device without subscribing to the broader philosophical and theological ramifications of his overall argument. 3 I am aware of Eickelman's objection to the use of the plural in discussing Islam in local</page><page sequence="20">70 WESTERN FOLKLORE contexts because it threatens the theologically based notion of unity (tauhild), but I would not agree with his assessment that such a move would only lead to "a plastic congeries of beliefs and practices" (Eickelman 1982:1-2). Moreover, Hinduism has always admitted the "unity in diversity" concept in popular practice, if not in doctri- nal position. 5 My use of the term essentialist is slightly different from the sense intended by Popper (1957), focusing not so much on the "realist" or universal dimension of essences, but on the conscious formation of empirical qualities that can be presupposed for the pur- poses of description. Merleau-Ponty (1962) suggests that if one presupposes a quality then one can simply proceed to search for things within these working presuppositions. The implications are that the researcher can always manipulate the data in such a way as to arrange them within preexisting categories. On essentialism in anthropological theory, see also Appadurai 1988:41. 36 Although the notion of imagining religion was popularized by J. Z. Smith (1982:xi- xiii), it is by no means a new concept, for it goes back to Spinoza and Vico. See Preus 1989. For a discussion of theological imagination in Kant and Hegel, see Green 1989:9-27.</page><page sequence="21">"EDITING" DHARMARAJ 71 Works Cited Abrahams, Roger D. 1986.
