<plain_text><page sequence="1">SHORTER NOTICES large circle intersected by cross bars, with a small pellet or circle in one of the quarters ... has been found in connexion with the signature of a Faenza fabrique "casa Pirota", and it is therefore presumed that all the pieces are from that fabrique. Now two of the amorini in the front of the present piece hold in their hands large golden balls or orbs quartered or barred in the same manner, and also containing the small pellet or circle in one of the quarters. From various indications the Faenza circle is obviously intended for a sphere or orb, though merely indicated in outline. The present device is, in fact, obviously the same as the Faenza mark. Further inferences might be drawn from this fact; the writer, however, at present merely wishes to put on record the circumstances that this device, common to a numerous and important class of wares, circa I520, occurs previously on a work of Giovanni Maria da Urbino executed at Castel Durante in I508.' If the device, in fact, represents a sphere, the logical inference is that it cannot under any circumstances be a wheel of any sort. No piece bearing the mark together with an inscription record- ing its manufacture in the 'casa Pirota' seems to have been published, nor has the writer been able to trace one. In fact, only two pieces are known bearing inscriptions to the effect that they were made in the Casa Pirota. One is a dish in the Museo Civico at Bologna painted with the Coronation of the Emperor Charles V and inscribed FATO IN FAENZA IN CAXA PIROTA. The other is a dish painted with the finding of the cup in Benjamin's sack, formerly in Baron Gustav de Roths- child's collection, which is inscribed I525. FATE.IN.FAE. IOXEF.I.CA.PIROTA. Neither bears any mark. An object closely resembling the mark, but with one of the diameters shown as a radius only, is illustrated by Claude Paradin in his Devises Hero'ques, Lyons I557, p.237, as the device of Monsieur l'Amiral de Chabot. He describes it as 'La Basle de vent (a iouer)'. The small circle is presumably, therefore, the hole for blowing up the ball. It seems rather more natural for a small boy to be playing with one of the large leather balls, inflated like a football, used in playing pallone, than with a fire-wheel. The pneumatic ball or pallone was used as a device by the Medici family and in particular by Giovanni Giacomo Medici di Marignano who died in I559.7 An early sixteenth-century battle-axe, formerly in an English private collection, had on one side of its head the arms of Medici and on the other a device in a shield, consisting of an object exactly like the so-called Casa Pirota mark and like the balls held by the small boys on the plates. This would appear to be the coat of arms of Giovanni Giacomo Medici di Marignano. The same mark has also been described as a bomb. The difference between the two objects, even in a fairly schematic drawing, is very clearly demonstrated by a fragment of a maiolica plate in the Museo Internazionale delle Ceramiche, Faenza, which has painted on its front one of the Montefeltro devices, a bursting bomb, and on its reverse the mark attributed to Casa Pirota. Although there is a superficial resemblance between the two, the bomb is shown with tongues of flame coming out of it at three places.8 If this mark represents a palldne there is no longer any reason at all to associate it with the Casa Pirota. It may only show a connection with the Medici family, perhaps as patrons of the 7 J. GELLI: Devise, motti, impresse di famiglie e personaggi italiani, Milan [9I16], p.486. 8 G. BALLARDINI: 'Alcune marche di Ca' Pirota', Faenza, XXVIII [I940], pp.66ff., pl.XVI a and b. 448 shop. On the other hand, if it is the trade-mark of a single firm, a case could be made for it being that of the dalle Palle family, who are recorded as potters in Faenza from I502.9 The mark drawn as a circle with a saltire reaching well beyond its circumference, also sometimes attributed to the Casa Pirota, is presumably quite distinct from the pallone mark. There is no doubt that many variants of the mark are purely decorative and are no indication of the place of manufacture at all. They are sometimes repeated several times on the underside of the rim, alternating with scrolls and other decorative features, and they frequently become confused with the circle and lozenge devices, both of which have overlapping saltires.10 The writer would like to thank Mr John Mallet and Mr Ronald Lightbown, both of the Victoria and Albert Museum, for their advice and help in preparing this note. 9 c.

Recent Museum Acquisitions James Rosenquist's 'Capillary Action No. 2' (National Gallery of Canada) IN I966 the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery of Canada decided as a matter of policy to include American works in its collection. Among the first acquisitions were two works by James Rosenquist (born I933), his large and controversial Painting for the American Negro of 1962-63 and the Capillary Action No.2 of I963 (Fig.39). The two inspired the one-man exhibition of the artist's work in Ottawa in January-February 1968. The construction, Capillary Action NVo.2 followed Capillary Action No.z, a large summer-like canvas of 1962 which is in the collection of Conte Giuseppe Panza di Biumo of Milan. The basis of the more eccentric Ottawa version is an actual dog-wood tree which the artist repaired in I967. Through the branches of the tree he set a rectangle of plastic painted in glowing colours and lit by one discreet square of rose neon light. It is one of Rosenquist's most consistently tender and romantic works. It was bought from the Galerie Ileana Sonnabend, Paris, in 1967. Leger's 'The Mechanic' (National Gallery of Canada) AS the first important step toward adding some cubist-inspired works to its collection, the National Gallery of Canada acquired Le Mecanicien of 1920 by Fernand Leger (1881-1955) from Louis Carre, Paris, in 1966 (Fig.4o). The most famous, although the second version of this subject (the first is from 19I8 and was in the Masurel Collection), this painting seems to put into human form the energy of the great cities Leger was painting at this time. The mechanic, heavily muscled, bare-armed, tattooed, and moustached, seems with his polished hair and his two rings the natural inhabitant of Leger's cities. At the same time, in his commanding pose and strength he is capable of having con- structed them; even the smoke from his cigarette pours forth as if it were from a factory chimney. The primary colours have the same elemental force.</page><page sequence="2">40. The Mechanic, by Fernand Leger. Signed and dated I920. Canvas, I I5'5 by 89 cm.

Klee's 'Winterliche Maske' (National Gallery of Canada) ALTHOUGH the Winterliche Maske by Paul Klee (I879-I940) is classified as a drawing, it is still large and monumental enough to give the impression of a painting, the first on this scale by Klee in Ottawa's collection (Fig.4I). Neatly labelled and classi- fied on the mount by the artist as I925 V 3, it comes from that difficult time in which Klee was caught in limbo between the closing of the Bauhaus in Weimar, where he was still living, and his move in 1926 to its new headquarters in Dessau. Full of visual puns, delicately balanced on the disc below the neck, it is painted with apparent detachment, largely stencilled and stippled, the brush only used for the red touches of paint on the cap and for the black eyes. It is enigmatic in a way that is reminiscent of Fish Magic in the Philadelphia Museum or Around the Fish of the Museum of Modern Art, New York, of 1925 and 1926. Formerly in the Ida Bienert Collection, it was bought from Nathan in Zurich in I967. Rouault's 'Les Deux Filles' (National Gallery of Canada) OTHER works by Georges Rouault (1871-1958) at the National Gallery of Canada represent Man's redemption including three Crucifixions - a drawing for the Miserere, a good impression of a coloured print and a gouache which was a recent gift of G. Hamilton Southam. As a result this early water-colour and pastel of Deux Filles (Fig.42) is not only important as an early work, dated I906, but one which explains the fervour of Rouault's later religious preoccupation. Juxtaposed against contemporary Fauve paintings in the collection, a Derain of I905, a Braque of 1906, a Vlaminck of I908 and a Van Dongen of I909, its sober blues seem particularly joyless. At the same time, in the freshness and intensity of the water-colour and the boldness of the characterization it is a commanding work. These two prostitutes, nearly contemporaries of Picasso's Demoiselles d'Avignon, are almost as brutally rendered as their five colleagues in the Picasso - but with greater compassion. The poignancy seems even more intense than some famous related paintings by Rouault including The Prostitute and The Mirror in the Musee National d'Art Moderne in Paris. It was formerly in the Witzinger Collection, Basle, and was bought from the Marlborough Gallery, London, in I967. David Smith's 'Wagon I' (National Gallery of Canada) IN 1968 Wagon I by the American sculptor, David Smith, was acquired by the National Gallery of Canada (Fig.43). It comes from that particularly productive period in Smith's life, beginning with his months in Italy for the Spoleto Festival of 1962 and ending with his tragic death in a motor car accident in May I965. Most of his late works fall into two series, the silvery, burnished, stainless-steel Cubis or the colourful, painted Zigs, but among them, quite different from the rest, are three Wagons. The source of inspiration for the Wagons seems to have been his Italian stay. Of a man who could say 'I'm interested in all art', it is not unreasonable to suspect the influence of Etruscan bronzes. But there is also a suggestion in the brown-black painted steel assembly of parts of the scrap iron pieces at Voltri, the deserted factories where the Italian government had encouraged Smith to work. And there could be a wistful memory of the flatcar he was given but had to abandon and about which he said later: 'I could have loaded a flatcar with vertical sheets and planes ... I could have made a flatcar with cloud ends... In a year, I could have made a train.' Smith, himself, described his wagons: 'It's a kind of iron chariot, on four wheels, with open linear elements', and he also explained 'They are too heavy for people to handle so I put wheels on them'. Actually Wagon I is more humanly scaled than this would suggest and also, with links to Smith's surrealist past, more anthropomorphic. Wagon I, which was exhibited in the memorial exhibition of Smith's work at the Tate in 1966, was bought from the Smith estate through the Marlborough-Gerson Gallery in 1968. It is now to be seen in the retrospective exhibition arranged by the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum; in its catalogue Edward Fry describes Wagon I as a 'robot centaur of the machine age'. Jackson Pollock's 'No. 29' (National Gallery of Canada) JACKSON POLLOCK'S No0.29 of I950 was the first large American abstract expressionist work to enter the collection of the National Gallery of Canada (Fig.44). Since gesture is such an important element in abstract expressionism, this work has a particular significance as the basis for the film Jackson Pollock of 1951 by Hans Namuth. Pollock worked on glass so that Namuth could photograph his face as he painted. The sheet of plate glass was placed on trestles outside on a sunny and cold autumn day, and Pollock was filmed putting the wire mesh, the strings, the pebbles and the pieces of coloured glass into place, rearranging them and finally binding them to the surface with black and aluminium paint, which he poured, manipulating it in the air with his stick, directly from their cans. Since the painting is on glass there are two images - the recto a coloured, crustaceous surface, the verso a black and silver record of the movements Pollock used in making the painting. In spite of the presence of Namuth's camera, Pollock succeeded in synthesizing the muscular ryhthms of his body, the unconscious energies of his mind and the inert objects from his environment into harmonious and even lyrical forms on the sheet of glass. No.29, which was acquired from the Pollock estate through the Marlborough-Gerson Gallery, New York, in 1967, is the only existing painting by Jackson Pollock on glass. Letters 'St John the Baptist preaching' in the Galleria Palatina SIR, I see in the March issue the attribution by Marco Chiarini to Elsheimer of a copper panel from the old Medici Collections belonging to the Galleria Palatina (No.366) showing St John the Baptist preaching. The suggestion is most stimulating and will not fail to arouse interest among specialists. 451</page></plain_text>
