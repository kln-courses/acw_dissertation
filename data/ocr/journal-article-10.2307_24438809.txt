Printing, what Malcolm McLuhan aptly called the 'ditto device', had the ability to produce cheap, multiple copies. The invention revolutionized our world and has been thought by some, for many years, to mark the significant difference between the medieval and modern world. However, although it has received less publicity, the printed illustration has probably been of greater significance. From the early woodblock drawings there is a continuous, unbroken development to colour printing, the cinema, television and the internet, all visual devices of communication whose impact is of the greatest importance in shaping people's thoughts and ideas. The theories of society are conveyed through this medium. Among the most numerous and most copiously illustrated early books are those on architecture, and, in particular, on military architecture, a subject whose explanation required visual images. Anatomy was another area that benefited greatly from the use of book illustration. The complex interweaving of muscle and sinew shown by Vesalius in De humani corporis fabrica of 1543 could not have been explained by words alone. The illustrated book could provide as much technical information on one page as would otherwise require some ten pages of printed text. The impact was both economic and effective. People now accept the idea that a picture can often tell much more, but it must have been a revelation in the middle years of the sixteenth century when illustrated printed books began to roll off the presses of western Europe. Not that books had been unavailable before that time, but they were expensive, each having to be copied out laboriously by scribes who, although they could imitate the written word with some speed, found it impossible to make several accurate copies of complex drawings. Their illustrations were usually original designs conceived more as works of art than methods of communication. University libraries like that at Paris carried up to a thousand manuscript volumes in the fourteenth century, but books generally were for the rich and privileged. From the thirteenth century paper, a Chinese invention introduced to Europe by the Arabs, began slowly to replace parchment. Block printing for illustration using woodblocks, which first appeared about 1400, preceded the invention of printing type, but by the 1520s was sometimes incorporated with it in the printed book. Steel engravings, which permitted the artist to show greater detail, were soon introduced. Most of the treatises discussed in this book are of the illustrated type, although some of the earlier ones by writers like Alberti were never intended to be illustrated, and some that were, like those by Filarete and Francesco di Giorgio, never reached the Renaissance presses. However, the source of inspiration for all was the writings of the Roman architect, Vitruvius, a few copies of which had survived in manuscript form without illustrations. It was this, added to ambiguity in the interpretation and trans © 2001 The Society for Renaissance Studies, Oxford University Press</page><page sequence="2">230 Reviews of books lation of his text and the unknown errors written in by scribes, that made Vitruvius so difficult to understand and use as a foundation for Renaissance architecture. Several writers spent much of their lives trying to get to the truth of Vitruvius. In form and arrangement, some early books, such as Alberti's De re aedificatoria, written for and originally in manuscript and without illustrations, tried to follow the layout of Vitruvius' De architectura, and much of Italian Renaissance theory was based on an attempt to translate the latter's underlying ideas on 'form, function, and delight' into a system that could be used in practical building. The result was the use of the Orders of Architecture, based on human attributes, the Tuscan Order being the most manly, followed by the Doric, and then the female form of a matron displayed in Ionic and Corinthian representing the frail figure of a young girl. These ideas were well if crudely illustrated in John Shute's interpretation of the Vitruvian Orders in his First and Chief Groundes of Architecture, where he drew figures of different gender and gracefulness alongside each of the different Orders. The anthropomorphic character of Renaissance architecture was firmly established and artists like Leonardo had depicted the proportions of a male figure overlying a square and a circle, two perfect Neoplatonic shapes. To practice the new classical style architects needed to have a complete mastery of spherical geometry, and geometry is one aspect of mathematics which can best be expressed in visual terms. There was also a need to illustrate the form of intricate mouldings with their subtle curves as, for example, displayed in the capitals of the Corinthian Order. Last, and perhaps most importantly, illustrations made it possible to show the interrelationship between plan, elevation, and section to scale so that dimensions could be taken directly from the printed page. For us a thorough understanding of the whole process of classical architecture can only be appreciated by understanding the material in the printed and illustrated treatises. That is what makes this book essential reading for all those interested in the theory of the Renaissance. It analyses the work of all the main theorists, some of whom were practitioners, and it looks at the development of ideas from those contained in the hand-written incunabula to the spread of Italian ideas into the rest of Europe through printed books whose contents were sometimes authorized but often stolen. The printed picture was not essential for architects to make practical application of buildings proportioned by Euclidian geometry; that geometrical system, we are told, had formed the basis of gothic architecture created by means of an oral tradition passed through memory by generations of secretive master masons. The text of Vitruvius had, from time to time, been read by medieval ecclesiastics. But it was the discovery by Poggio Bracciolini of a manuscript copy of Vitruvius in a ruined library in northern Italy in 1414 that opened the way for scholars, by reading it, to substitute theories of proportion based on the ideas of the ancient philosopher, Plato, which Vitruvius had incorporated into his text. These Neoplatonic theories became the basis of High Renaissance architecture and, through the influence of the men like Palladio, were diffused throughout western architecture. Lord Burlington, armed with a copy of Palladio's I quattro libri di architettura annotated by the British architect, Inigo Jones, visited Italy and returned to England to initiate a classical style based on the houses designed by Vincenzo Scamozzi and Palladio and illustrated in their books. These were to form the model for the English country house of the eighteenth century built in the Palladian style. One of the many conflicts that arose over the interpretation of the rules suggested</page><page sequence="3">Reviews of books 231 by Vitruvius and rationalized by Alberti was that they were at variance with the evidence on the ground. The numerous Roman ruins that abounded in cities like Rome told a different and conflicting story so that often their proportions and details differed from those suggested by the writers. Written by various authors, each expert in their own field, this book flows so convincingly that one might be forgiven in believing it to be by one author. It is a fine collection of valuable essays, but it is only possible to mention a few of the interesting items that emerge on reading this book. Any attempt to do justice in a review to the richness and variety of the ideas in the book must be futile. There are chapters on the writings of all the main theorists of Renaissance architecture, explaining its debt to Roman classical architecture, its attempt to be both appealing and of practical use, and its deep use of symbolism. This comes out well in the essay on Francesco Colonna's Hypnerotomachia, of which until recently only the illustrations were easily accessible to English readers. Now the meaning behind the text is explained, the sensuous relationship explored between love and architecture, and the concept of erotic space that has its origins in Graeco Roman culture. The importance of Guillaume Philandrier's In decern libros M. Vitruvii Pollionis de Architectura Annotationes, and his Digression, in laying the foundation for the serious study of Vitruvius' text and previously rather neglected by western art historians, is clearly stated and stressed. The books of Sebastiano Serlio, which came out almost in serial form, with text and illustrations carefully and purposefully integrated, probably had the greatest impact on practising architects and craftsmen, spreading the influence of the new style across Europe. They introduced the reader to the basics of geometry and linear perspective, they explained proportion, they illustrated old Roman buildings and some of their modern counterparts, they clearly showed architectural details and decoration, and they provided innumerable examples of the whole and parts of buildings, providing a valuable copybook for practitioners, many of whom were unable or unwilling to read the text. The books became a sort of short cut to practice. And so, also, did the books written by Palladio, Scamozzi, and Vignola. This is a wonderful collection of essays which encapsulates the essence of the Renaissance in Europe. It is a book that contains complex theories that require concentrated reading, but a serious study of its contents is enormously rewarding and the result will be an invaluable asset in any assessment of the Renaissance.
