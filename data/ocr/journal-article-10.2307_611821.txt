<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE DE WATAU SOTAPAN: A MON PROTOTYPE OF THE 37 NATS By H. L. SHORTO 'Of these spirits (called kaluk in their language) they say there are thirty-seven distinct varieties, but Min-magayi rules them all. These are the "thirty-seven nats of Burma ", but whether they were borrowed by the Burmese from the Talaings or not seems at any rate doubtful.' Shway Yoe, The Burman : his life and notions. Third ed., London, 1927, 235. In the literature which has grown up around the Burmese tradition of the 37 nats two omissions have been generally conspicuous. Much has been placed on record regarding the cults of individual members of this pantheon; yet what constitutes the corporate cult of the 37 remains obscure. In casting around for a unifying principle, writers on the subject have made much of the secular status of the persons who became nats and the manner of their deaths. It has escaped comment that most of the details recorded belong not so much to mythology as to hagiography, and concern the earthly careers of those who were deified rather than their nature and powers as gods.1 A way was opened to the solution of the first of these problems when in 1963 Dr. E. M. Mendelson suggested that the traditional list of the 37 was evolved by a royal priesthood under the Pagan empire, in an accommodation of local cults to an ideal political organization of a microcosmic kind.2 In an article published in the same year I noted the existence of a cult of the kind postulated by Dr. Mendelson in the independent Mon kingdom, advancing the view that it inspired the Burmese synthesis.3 The exploration of these two hypotheses goes far to explain the lacunae in the accounts we have of the nats, and I shall now examine the evidence for their supposed prototype at greater length. THE DEWATAU SOTAPAN The most explicit reference to the Mon cult occurs in the course of an encomium on Dhammaceti, who was king of Pegu from 1472 to 1492, in the mid-sixteenth-century Niddna drambhakatha. After reciting his acts in the Buddhist sphere the chronicle describes how, in order to ensure the safety of the kingdom, he established a list of 36 ' stream-winning gods' (dewatau sotkpan), to whom he then made offerings which included the white umbrellas of royalty. In addition he made lesser offerings to 15 other gods 'at the proper season', 1 On the 37 nats see especially J. G. Scott and J. P. Hardiman, Gazetteer of Upper Burma and the Shan States, Pt.

The 36 are divided into two groups, one of 16 or 17 whose shrines are in the capital or its immediate vicinity, and a second with locations ranging from Zaingganaing, the 'forest bank' opposite Pegu, to Tavoy. Most of them, if not all, are tree spirits at pagodas or other Buddhist sites, and this explains the use of the term sotdpan ; with hearing many sermons such a deity embarks on the first of the four stages to enlightenment: stream-winner, once-returner, never-returner, arahat. The passage runs as follows :4 ' Nor was he content with establishing the Religion so that it might increase ; in order to ensure the spiritual advancement of the nation, and so as to avert all kinds of perils, he summoned up wise gods by marvellous means, and having learnt the dwelling-places of the stream-winning Mighty Ones, offered white umbrellas, prayer-flags (jnow), gold and silver lamps, food, and Woodfordia floribunda flowers to them.

The explanation can hardly lie in his vulgar reputation as a magician ;" although this may be reflected in the 'marvellous means' by which he established the list, and it is as well to be reminded of the gulf between learned and popular traditions. A key should rather be sought in the nostalgic attraction of his reign for a chronicler writing in the troubled times which followed the extinction of the dynasty and the annexation of Pegu by the rulers of Toungoo. The reign had been pacific and prosperous, and demanded space in the record which could not be filled with the usual account of campaigns. 8 Or ' of the Moustache Ficus at Rangoon '. 9 Or ' of the budding Ficus at Rangoon'. 10 These two have been conflated in the text by the omission of an index number, and subsequent numbers adjusted accordingly, to accommodate the misreading referred to in n. 7 above.

SHORTO If its place was to be supplied by the acts which to a contemporary understanding had secured that prosperity, the reform of the sahigha and the construction of a replicate Buddh Gaya outside the capital could only be part of the tale. Dhammaceti was being commemorated as king, and not as monk. As we shall shortly see, the logic underlying the structure of the cult links it with other parts of the religio-political apparatus and is fair evidence of its antiquity. We must suppose that the list itself was subject to periodical revision like that of the Burmese nats.15 This is surely the import of the reference to Dhammaceti's calling up oracular deities to learn what gods he should acknow- ledge, and accounts for the inclusion of spirits associated with his own founda- tions : the Mahabodhi, the Ajapalacetiya, and the Four Buddhas in his 'little Holy Land ',16 the Kalyani sim&amp;,17 and probably the Shwegugyi monastery.'s It is conceivable that nats and Stream-winners were confirmed in office at the beginning of every reign, much as the king reappointed chiefs who were in effect hereditary. But Dhammaceti, an adoptive son of his predecessor Shin Sawbu though formally he continued her dynasty, was remarkable for his radicalism.'9 The designation of the gods as sotdpan, a mechanism which makes them respectable in Buddhist terms, may well have been his inspiration. The spirits whose cult sites lie outside Pegu and its immediate vicinity- from no. 10 onwards in the ' forest bank ' group-all belong to centres significant in the evolution of the Mon state, and exhibit the type of synthesis of local cults which Dr. Mendelson postulates for Pagan. The largest group are the five of Rangoon, at this time a holy city dependent on the Shwe Dagon pagoda, whose sanctity was second only to that of the Shwemawdaw. I have suggested elsewhere that it was the nucleus of an early Mon principality on the edge of the Irrawaddy delta.20 Its five gods are mentioned in Rajawahi datow smifi, which following a divergent tradition names them as the god of Bamboo End, also called Amrta ; of Bael-tree Hill; the god (of the ?) Rohini ; of Asoka-tree Hill (duiw 'asuk ; cf. the Athok pagoda above) ; and of Iron Hill.21 The Kyaikkhauk is the chief pagoda of Syriam, a unit of the same principality which subsequently enjoyed a special though ill-defined status as an independent province.

Lastly, Zingyaik appears in the list by virtue of its sacred hill where the legendary founders both of Thaton and of Pegu were reared ; a topic further to be discussed below. The number 36 links the Stream-winners in their original form with the system of territorial organization which I described in 'The 32 myos in the medieval Mon kingdom '.23 Medieval Ramafifia was divided into 32 districts in addition to the capital, an arrangement attributed to Thaton before it and probably going back beyond Thaton to the Pyu kingdom of gri Ksetra. Above the princes who were the titular heads of the districts were four baPids or dukes, leaders in war and council who may once have been rulers of provinces. Under- lying all this was a process of federation of independent principalities and chiefdoms, but the formal model derived from Indian cosmology: the king and his 32 lords represented the gods of the Tavatim.sa heaven, while the baaiis stood for the Lokapdlas, regents of the four quarters.24 In the Thaton prototype each district as well as the capital was protected by possession of a stupa containing a tooth of the Buddha, the sites of which constituted 'the domains and possessions of the Mon country'. The tradition was known to Dhammaceti, who like Kyanzittha before him25 repaired stupas supposedly of the Thaton set. While the pagodas associated with his Stream- winners do not correspond to the districts of his kingdom, they do in a general way cover the extent of his ' domains and possessions' as those are set forth in the Kalyani inscription. When all the evidence is considered together, there is a strong supposition that the sotapan were once to be found at stupas which were the places of state worship for the kingdom, its four provinces, and their 32 districts.26 22 cf. Shorto, ' The Kyaikmaraw inscriptions ', BSOAS, xxI, 2, 1958, 361 ff. 23 BSOAS, xxvI, 3, 1963, 572-91. 24 The same symbolism was applied to the captains of the palace guard, as the title accorded them, smin waiz, shows. Were the offices ever identical ? The phrase smiit wafi jataif found at inscription xII, M 21-2 (Epigraphia Birmanica, II, 2, 172), may represent an earlier *smiif wait caturat ' regents of the fourfold army '. Heine-Geldern notes a similar duplication in the Burmese wungyi and winhmu: 'Weltbild und Bauform in Siidostasien', Wiener Beitrdge zur Kunst- und Kulturgeschichte Asiens, Iv, 1930, 54. 25 I failed to note in ' The 32 myos ... ' the reference at inscription vii, A 7-8, to Kyanzittha's restoration of the 'great relic stupas built by King Dharmisoka', Dhammaceti's Sirimisoka (Epigraphia Birmanica, I, 2, 1920, 157; reading mahaidhatu). 26 Dhammaceti's list raises the question whether there was not at some stage a wholesale transplantation of district cults and relics to the capital, involving the establishment of a micro- microcosm there as well as the alienation of potentially dangerous power, 'anubhau, from conquered territory. We may compare the transplantation of the ' Duttabaung cycle' of Prome nats to Pagan. In this spirit Anawrahta carried off the images of the gods from Thaton (pp. 140-1 below); and princes, too, were increasingly kept at court.</page><page sequence="6">132 H. L.SHOTO That the guardian god of Pegu resided at the Shwemawdaw we know. A passage in Rajidhiraj describes how Duke Nay, the future Rajadhiraj, sought an augury from him. The prince had first to inscribe the letters of his name on a square copper plate-presumably in the form of a magic square or 'ai. He then made three sets of offerings : the first to the nine planetary houses; the second, at each gate of the city, of the 108 cups of rice said elsewhere in the work to be to 'the gods who send dreams and omens '; and the last and most elaborate to the gods in his own house. Finally, after invoking the guardian at the pagoda, he got his omens in a circuit of the gates.27 The offering of rice in 108 cups suggests a further elaboration. The notion of a triple division into heaven, middle earth, and chthonos is central to the older Burmese world picture.28 Thus in Kyanzittha's Shwezigon inscription Pagan is allotted a protector on each plane, Gavampati upholding on earth the 'un- shakeable place ' which Indra watches over from his heaven above and the niga king Krtakarman from below.29 We already have parallel sets of 36 celestial and 36 terrestrial deities, if Indra is omitted from the first as (I shall so postulate) his earthly counterpart has been from the second. The third, chthonic set is to be deduced from the juxtaposition of spirit-tree and pagoda. This juxtaposition, which is still to be seen in Lower Burma, recalls that of tree and mound in the cult sites of the Chinese god of the soil described on p. 137 below. The Burmese stupas are essentially tumuli elaborated into a symbol of the world-mountain. It is not unduly fanciful to suppose that the more ancient and numinous among them have appropriated the sacred places of an earlier religion. But if, as the comparative evidence suggests, the original tumuli on their hill-tops were foci of chthonic power,30 mound and tree are likely to have differed from their Chinese counterparts in housing distinct gods, their propinquity reflecting coincidence of sanctuary rather than of domain ; for the Stream-winners were male, whereas chthonic deities in Mon tradition appear always to have been female. The Indian earth-god Visundhara reached South East Asia as a goddess, Visundhari or Dharani, whom the Mons call a bau: literally a 'grandmother' or ' ancestress '. The term recurs as the designation of one of the two principal classes of spirit which current reckoning acknowledges: the male kalok or lineage spirits, ancestral house-protectors whose cult descends in the male line, and the bau, village spirits who convey the right to territory. To understand the nature of these ' ancestresses ' we must turn to royal myth. The Mon kings claimed to originate from the union on Zingyaik hill of a wizard of solar race 27 Rdjddhiraj, in Phra Candakanta (ed.), Sudhammavatira-jvamhsa--Sharajfdhirafjvaahsa, Pak Lat, 1910 (hereafter cited as SR), 178-9. 28 It has an analogy in the Taoist tripartition of heaven, earth, and water, the dragons which rule the last corresponding to the chthonic ndgas of South East Asian tradition. 29 Epigraphia Birmanica, I, 2, No. i, H 5-13. 30 cf. the Chinese explanation quoted on p. 137 ; and on the sanctity of high places Mendelson, op. cit., 788. H. G. Quaritch Wales, 'Dvdravati in South-East Asian cultural history', JRAS, 1966, Pts. 1-2, 47-9, discounts this view, but without all the evidence here adduced.</page><page sequence="7">THE DEWATAU SOTAPAN: A MON PROTOTYPE OF THE 37 NATS 133 and a ndg7, a legend attributing to them that immanence of the powers of sky and earth which was symbolized in the bathing ritual of their consecration. But the land-rights inherited from the serpent princess descended in the female line, and we infer from Burmese practice that they ensured the conjunction of matrilineage and patrilineage by marrying their half-sisters. If the intention of the Stream-winner cult was indeed cadastral, logic implies that the original cult sites were shrines where a chief honoured his personal kalok, the ancestral guardian of his line, and the bau whose dowry was his chiefdom. This incidentally may help to explain how the foremost of the Pagan nats, the lord of Mahagiri or Popa, came to be the ubiquitous house-guardian, the einsaung nat, of the Burmese. Dr. Mendelson has traced his role as protector of the dynasty-significantly, he once refused to appear or speak to a king not of the true solar line-and has expressed the opinion that his function as house- guardian was secondary.31 The cult of the einsaung nat so strikingly resembles that of the kalok that they must have a common origin ; but whereas the kalok is the property of a particular lineage, residing in the house of the senior member, the einsaung nat is worshipped in every house and is undifferentiated. It would appear that the Burmese took over the idea of the kalok as house-guardian, but honoured him not as their personal lineage spirit but as that of their king : the lord of Mahagiri.32 THE MAGIC MOUNTAIN Whereas the cadastral hypothesis calls for 37 Stream-winners, Dhammaceti's list is of 36 only. One is impelled to assume, on the analogy of references to 33 or 32 myos according as the capital is included or not, that the missing god is the chief of the pantheon. There is, however, a somewhat similar anomaly in the case of the Burmese nats which should first be discussed. Their chief is always named as Thagya Min, i.e. Sakra or Indra. But since Sakra is already the chief of the gods of the Tavatimsa heaven, his place among the nats has been much disputed. Dr. Mendelson says that 'the 37 Nats are headed by Indra in theory but by Mahdgiri in practice';33 and Dr. Htin Aung argues that the Mahagiri nat is the true chief, that Sakra was added to bring the cult under Buddhist control, and that the original pantheon numbered 36.34 I prefer to assume that the proper number is 37, and that a nat was dropped from the Burmese list, which we know was amended from time to time, to accommodate the usurper. The inclusion of Sakra can be interpreted in various ways; in particular, the solar lineage claimed for the king may have led to a demand for a celestial, not merely terrestrial, ancestor. 31 op. cit., 782-3. 32 Htin Aung's explanation (Folk elements, 78-9) of the Mahagiri nat's domestic function is not wholly convincing. He notes a dhammathat tale which may be thought to connect house- guardians with tree-spirits. Grant Brown (op. cit., 90) records a variant tradition that the nat obtained the right of entry into all houses when he asked his sisters (one of whom in the standard version shares his Popa cult as the Shwe Myethna nat) for a kingdom. 33 op. cit., 787. 34 Folk elements, 73-5.</page><page sequence="8">134 H. L. SHORTO Though I postulate no more than that the Burmese borrowed the principle of the cult from the Mons, many of the differences between nat and sotapan beliefs could be the result of later divergence, and one would hope to find more points of contact than the mere coincidence of number. Such links are notably to be discerned in the traditions attaching to Zingyaik hill on the one hand and Mount Popa on the other. The Thaton dynasty supposedly originated when a wizard (wij*Fdhuiw) from Vipulaparvata encountered a ndga princess on the flowery top of Zingyaik. From the eggs which resulted there came male twins, the elder of whom, Suriyakumara, was raised by a hermit on the hill and became the first king of Thaton. The younger, Candakumara, was brought up on Zwegabin hill by another hermit and, dying at the age of 6, was reborn to become the Buddha's disciple Gavampati, patron saint of Ramaiiha.35 In the Pegu origin legend a similar union on Zingyaik hill produced a golden girl who in due course became chief queen of Martaban and gave birth to twins, Samala and Wimala. On her parentage being discovered, the boys were cast out, to be brought up by the hermit who had reared their mother. Samala became the first king of Pegu, acquiring his own prodigious queen who was born from a pumpkin ; but he was later murdered and supplanted by his brother, the rightful line being restored on the accession of Samala's son Asah.36 The Mahagiri nat shares his Popa cult with his sister Shwe Myethna; but his consort before his deification has become another nat of the 37, Shwe Nabe. Tradition makes her again a ndg-i, a daughter of the sea serpent who died of grief either at her husband's desertion or at the death of her sons Shinbyu and Shinnyo. These White and Dark Lords, similarly reared by a hermit, were deified as lords of the south and north after being made to box to exhaustion before the king of Prome.37 These last events are connected with Popa only through the person of the Mahagiri nat ; but they are echoed in another legend which is not only directly connected with the mountain, but provides a metamythical link with Zingyaik. Anawrahta's captain of Popa was Byatta, the younger of the two 'Indian brothers ' who had been raised by a monk of Zingyaik after being found floating in the sea on a tray. Byatta's principal duty was to bring flowers from the mountain, and while engaged on this task he met an ogress, Panza ' mistress of flowers ', on whom he begot twin sons. He was executed, though invulnerable, for dilatoriness while begetting them. The twins rose high among Anawrahta's captains and were deified as the Taungbyon nats after they in turn had been executed. Their mother also became a nat, though not one of the 37.3s 35 Uppanna Sudhammawatf-ra-iwahisa-kathik, in SR, 11-12; Gawampati, ibid., 55-6. 36 R. Halliday (ed.), Lik smi[ii] Asa[b], Rangoon, 1923, passim ; Nidana drambhakathd, 16-21; Gawampati, 84-90. 37 Temple, op. cit., 46; Htin Aung, Folk elements, 85-6, 88-9. A different tradition is preserved at Mindon, of which Shwe Nabe is tutelary goddess, and Dr. Htin Aung supposes a conflation of cults. Shwe Nabe's icon, showing her with ndga head-dress, often resembles that of Shwe Myethna without the vahana. 38 Htin Aung, Folk elements, 67-73, 91-2; Temple, op. cit., 49-50. Although Htin Aung gives the sons successive births, the Mahagita medanigyan, cited by Temple, makes them twins.</page><page sequence="9">THE DEWATAU SOTAPAN: A MON PROTOTYPE OF THE 37 NATS 135 A variant of this story is recorded by Dr. Mendelson in connexion with the neighbouring hill of Taungalat.39 The 'flower-eating' panza 40 of this version is Mewunna, chief nat of the hill and more potent than any of the 37. She was a princess of Thaton who came there in pursuit of the religious life, and her ogre guise was imposed on her by Byatta as a condition of release from his bed. The killing of the sons is the chief difference between the Burmese legends and that of Suriyakumara and Candakumara. In the context of Burmese beliefs about violent death as a qualification for nat-hood it has an obvious political interpretation in terms of the removal of a potential threat to the royal supremacy. Could it also mythically commemorate the subordination of Mon gods to the Burmese kings ?41 The two flower-scented mountains, haunt of serpent princesses, hermits, and wizards, certainly draw that character from Indian legends of the Himalaya, as the name of Gandhamadana variously given to each of them makes explicit.42 But their location south-east respectively of Pagan and of Thaton and Pegu precludes their identification with the central Meru which the Glass Palace Chronicle, as Dr. Mendelson has remarked, avoids, and calls for an indigenous charter. This is surely provided once we accept the probability that their guardians were the kalok or ancestors of the kings; for it is in the south-east post of the house that kalok and einsaung nat reside. The relationship of the Mahagiri nat to the kings of Pagan was essentially that of a kalok, and the joint cult at Popa is reminiscent of the cults of kalok and bau which we have postulated for the archetypal Mon shrines. It remains to consider who was the guardian of Zingyaik. Suriyakumara and Candakumara became respectively the first king of Thaton and, after reincarnation, its apostle, reproducing at a humbler level the choice between the states of cakravartin and Buddha which tradition allows to Bodhisattas.43 But the stages by which Gavampati came to be accepted as the Byatta entered Burmese service when he was suborned by Kyanzittha to overcome the spirit of his brother Byatwi, which guarded Thaton. The tale bears a certain resemblance to Mon legends of the Thaton champions Prdp Jnok and Prip D)ot, ' Big ' and ' Little' Prap. It is difficult to reconcile the names, but Byatta and Byatwi might be corruptions of Prap Sturim and Prip Jwi, 'Right-hand' and 'Left-hand' Prip. The theme of invulnerables who allow themselves to be killed is to the fore in all these legends. 39 op. cit., 795-6. 40 The name bears either interpretation. 41 The possibility that there was a historical Byatta who brought the Zingyaik cult to Popa suggests an explanation differing in some respects from that put forward above. On this hypothesis, it would have been Byatta who fastened on Prome gods the naga ancestry on which Dr. Htin Aung casts doubt, and concocted a similar legend about himself as the chief devotee. His execu- tion, and that of his sons who inherited the cult, can then be seen as steps in its annexation. The special royal devotion to the Mahagiri nat appears to have begun with Kyanzittha. 42 For Gandhamidana as a name of Popa, see Mendelson, op. cit., p. 806, n. 25; and of Zingyaik hill, NR, 16. 43 As against lineage, reincarnation is patently a Buddhist theme, though both are often cited in legitimation of a king or chief. But the dual destinies of the twins may be older than Buddhism ; Dr. C. Hooykaas has drawn my attention to a Balinese tradition in which the guardian ndga of a magic mountain has descendants who are respectively priest and self-styled worldly ruler.</page><page sequence="10">136 H. L.SHORTO patron saint of Ramafifia are curious. He cannot be accounted for from Theravada sources, and his legend seems to have been elaborated on the basis of a summary reference in the Mahdkarmavibhaiga which states that Gavampati converted Suvarnabhfimi.44 He did not, however, always present the orthodox figure of a Buddhist patriarch. In the inscription which records Anawrahta's building of a Gavampati shrine at Pagan, we are told that the king offered to him not the robes of a monk but a minister's duyin, the coat-like garment that the Mahagiri nat is usually shown wearing.45 In the shrine of the Three Gems in Kyanzittha's palace Gavampati represented the saingha ; but at the Tainggyut pagoda in 1179 his two images appear to have filled the role of guardians, and were excluded from the gift of robes to the images of the Buddha, Sariputta, and Moggalldna.46 The most likely explanation is that Gavampati is a Buddhist metamorph of Ramafiiia's guardian deity. He is connected with Zingyaik not only as Candakumara but by the legend which in the chronicles accounts for his return to Ramaiiiia as evangelist : he came, as the Buddha to Tavatimsa, to proclaim the Doctrine to his mother, who had been reborn in Taungbo just north of the hill. It may be significant that in the Mon version of a widespread mandala of the chief disciples he is displaced from his usual station in the north- west, probably to the south-east one.47 We can now see why the Pagan where Kyanzittha honoured the 37 nats48 should be protected by Indra, Gavampati, and Krtakarman. The 'stream-winner of the syrup-fig tree in the Hair Relic ssma ' appears so signally demoted in Dhammaceti's list because his powers had passed elsewhere. THE SHE AND THE KUT The sotdpan cult, being part of the apparatus of state, lost its raison d'etre when the Mon kingdom was absorbed by the expanding empire of the Burmese. Direct evidence being consequently scanty, and the relevance of Burmese data limited by the visible divergence of the nat and sotdpan cults, the investigator is thrown back on conjecture to a regrettable degree. In these circumstances evidence that comparable practices prevailed in neighbouring parts of Asia at an early date may considerably reinforce his conclusions; and in the Chinese god of the soil (fi_ she) and the kut steles of the Chams we have two institutions which, like the sotapan, are cadastral-concerned with territorial units and reflecting territorial organization-and show other similarities as well. 44 S.

It was hierarchically organized, with gods of one kind or another at a series of levels: in its earliest (Chou) form, family, canton, district, kingdom, and empire. The elaboration betrays the bureaucratic genius of the Chinese, which issued also in regulations that guarantee our knowledge of the cult. ' Registered god of the soil ' was in fact used in official documents to designate the canton of 25 families as a unit of population. The she was according to the Li chi ' the deification of the energies of the earth'. The cult site consisted of a tumulus accompanied by a tree, which in Chou times stood on the tumulus, and by a chu, originally a stone aniconic image half buried in the ground. All three were in some measure identified with the god. The commentators explain that 'since the soil is divine in its entirety, one ought to sacrifice to it everywhere ; but since this is impossible, one selects certain places where one raises a heap of earth in order to concentrate in it all the latent energies of the soil around it '. Sacrifices to the cantonal god took place in spring. From the district upwards the shU had a harvest god as coadjutor. 50 The cult was an official charge, and the sacrifices, in spring and autumn, were performed by the governor or ruler. At the highest levels, those of the emperor and the vassal kings, a special system prevailed. These princes had both personal and public gods, only the latter of whom had a harvest god as his companion. The public god had an altar or tumulus west of the palace, on the opposite side to the ancestral temple, while the altar of the personal god was in the sacred field where the royal plough- ing took place and which provided the grain for offerings. The personal god was mobile, and in the form of the chu accompanied the emperor on his campaigns. The installation of district gods was provided for by regulation, and they were thus under the control of the emperor. At the higher levels they were literally in his gift. The imperial altar was square, each side being faced with earth of a distinct colour ; and the ceremony of investiture of a vassal king consisted in giving him a clod from the appropriate face to be incorporated in his provincial altar as his she. The vassal's altar was all of the one colour and so proclaimed the quarter in which his kingdom lay. The custom, limited to sons of the emperor under the Later Han, afterwards continued in its original form to the early seventh century A.D. The subordination of the gods to the emperor parallels that which we deduce from the royal revisions of the Burma lists. According to Mencius, inefficient soil and harvest gods could be superseded. ' If '-in Chavannes's paraphrase- 9 Annales du Mus6e Guimet: Bibliotheque d']tudes, xxI, Paris, 1910. 50 The association recalls that of bau and kalok postulated above, if the harvest gods were gods of sky or rain.

SHORTO ' these gods fail to perform their office well, if, having received the sacrifices to which they are entitled, they through negligence allow calamities to occur which ruin the people, they are dismissed like bad officials and replaced'. When a new dynasty took power the old dynasty's soil god was neutralized, or, in the opinion of such authors as Ts'ai Yung, killed, by cutting down the tree and erecting a building over the mound. The she must have access to the sky in order to function, and the building, lit by a northern window, let in only the passive principle of yin.51 The sterile mound was preserved as a perpetual warning. Somewhat curiously, vassal kings were given clods from this mound as well, to erect their own ' perpetual warnings '. Making allowance for the differences of development imposed by the Mon and Chinese temperaments, and for the different religious histories of the two countries, we can discern harmonies enough between the cults besides the similarity of cult sites already noted.52 The Chinese were concerned to extinguish the god of a conquered dynasty. In the same intention, when Sri Ksetra fell, the Mon king of Pegu broke open its chief pagoda and removed the relics for his own use.53 The great value of the Chinese data is that they allow us to see the function of a tumulus cult before it has been obscured by the conversion of the tumuli into stupas. They then, from being loci of worship, become objects of worship: pujaniyawatthu, the literal term used of relic pagodas in Mon in- scriptions. Once they acquire an intrinsic value, their connexion with a cadastral system-which is both territorial and social-is apt to be lost. Nevertheless, at the Mon national and provincial capitals pagodas such as the Shwemawdaw and the Myatheindan continued to be the centres of state worship; and, as we have seen, as late as 1383 it was to the gods that men prayed there. Whereas the Stream-winners correspond to the higher levels in the she hierarchy, the analogies of the Cham kut steles are with the lower ones. The cult has been analysed by Paul Mus,54 who drew to some extent on the work of Aymonier and Cadiere.55 The steles are the sophisticated counterpart of a more widely distributed cult of aniconic godstones, which like the tumulus and its chu incorporate the energies of the earth. They perform the same function for the family as do the stones, in Champa, for the community. The latter mark the centre of a territory, and are also intimately connected with boundary spirits. The kut are set up in the centre of the family's sacred field from which come rice 51 This may well be why Burmese guhds are crowned by a stupa or 8ikhara-they are not caitya caves !-and why the spire of a stupa always protrudes from a surrounding cetiyaghara, an arrangement retained in the design of the modern Kaba-e. 52 It may have been a back-current of the Chinese practice that induced Bayinnaung in 1553 to flank the east gate of his palace-this being in Burma the direction of honour-with 'hills of Good Empery' (duiw surajja) surmounted by ' RMma's tree of Good Empery ', as recorded at NR, 146. 53 Pe Maung Tin and G.

They themselves receive offerings periodically, and when a person is cremated the remains of the frontal bone are buried near them. They are understood as representing the ancestors. Mus considers that the kut combine ancestor worship with a chthonic cult. He argues that such cults always require an intermediary, who is usually the chief, between the group and the god (a view with which both the Mon and the Chinese evidence is consonant). In many ways an ancestor is the ideal inter- mediary, buried in the earth as he is, and more potent than the living. (The imperial she had a dynastic ancestor associated with him, though Chavannes discounts the importance of the fact inasmuch as every Chinese deity had a human associate.) In their simplest form the kut somewhat resemble semt boundary stones. In one instance the pointed top of the stele is prolonged into the semblance of a woman's chignon cover. Other more explicitly anthropomorphic kut have the upper part of a human figure carved on the front. Some Cham statues of Hindu gods approach this iconography, and Mus would place the royal lingam cult of the Hindu period in the same religious complex. The lingam incorporated the immortal soul of the king as a local exemplar of Siva, all three sharing the same name. But it was often made by rebuilding an ancestral lingam, and was given a composite name that marked this, as in Sambhu-bhadreivara, Bhadravarman's lingam rebuilt by gambhu- varman. The same incorporative principle is found in Mon and Burmese royal names, which grow excessively long by the end of a dynasty.56 As places of burial the kut have a Mon parallel in the daldhi jut, brick pillars in which the frontal bone and other fragments remaining after cremation are immured.57 The name, which literally means 'bone-altars', suggests that the pillars once received offerings. In the Shan states the remains of a monk are sometimes buried under a post with a lotus-bud finial.58 It is important to notice a distinction between the cadastral deities we have been considering and the ordinary spirits of locality-of trees, stones, streams, particular corners-which pullulate throughout South East Asia. The latter exercise their powers independently of who passes by. But s7ht, kut ancestor, and the bau-kalok dyad bind together a specific territory and the specific community resident in it ; thus the Chinese canton, a territorial unit defined as an aggregate 56 The longest is that of Makutarijd, probably the ' Manuha ' of the chronicles, in the Thaton inscriptions reproduced at Inscriptions of Burma, Portfolio Iv, plates CCCLVIII, CCCLIX. Several of the epithets of which it is composed are proper to a saivite god-king : -parameswara 'iswararaja 'abheyamahrdrjadewatidewa-. It might be illuminating, in view of the common Burmese prejudice against repairing a pagoda as opposed to building a new one (for which cf. e.g. Shway Yoe, The Burman : his life and notions. Third ed., London, 1927, 153-4), to compile a list of the stupas erected by their predecessors which kings nevertheless repeatedly rebuilt, enlarged, or repaired. Inscription xv in Epigraphia Birmanica, Iv, 1, lists four such rebuildings of the Shwe Dagon down to the fifteenth century. 51 I have noted the same custom in Ceylon, where the frontal bone may be exposed to view in a glass-fronted compartment. 58 Grant Brown, op. cit., 96.</page><page sequence="14">140 H. L. SHORTO of families. The bond is completed, Mus argues, when a boundary is fixed and the settlement rights of neighbouring communities thus implicitly recognized ;59 and so with the establishment of higher forms of political organization the cellular cult inevitably coalesces into one which matches the articulation of the polity. In developed states the bond between land and people is apt to harden into villeinage; only in the ideal kingdom envisaged by Kyanzittha might 'the common people ... come to travel about' like lords.60 To sum up, an examination of the direct and comparative evidence leads to the hypothesis that at an early date Mon chiefs practised a cult which in one form or another was widespread in East and South East Asia. It united the worship of a male ancestor with that of a chthonic goddess by whose favour the tribe laid claim to its land, the two being represented at the shrine by a tree and a mound respectively. With the rise of federative states at a period of strong Indian cultural influence these local cults were progressively integrated into a hierarchic pattern. By the exploitation of a principle of quadripartite orientation already well established in the area, they came to be assimilated to a political organization of 32 district chiefs under a high king served by four dukes, the microcosmic counterparts of the 33 gods of the Tdvatimsa heaven and the four lokapdlas. The result was the recognition of parallel sets of 37 celestial, terres- trial, and chthonic deities. At the same time the cult was made subordinate to Buddhism by the conversion of the mounds into stupas which protected the territory in which they lay, while the tree-spirits associated with them became the equally Buddhist sotdpan. The absorption of the Mon state in a larger Burmese unity entailed the disappearance of the central cult, and the significance of local centres, already obscured by Buddhicization, was correspondingly lost. This sufficiently accounts for the paucity of direct evidence. Nevertheless the tradition of the- sotapan lingered into the eighteenth century, when the northern gate and quarter of Martaban were still known as ' Thawdaban ' after the 18th of the ' forest bank' stream-winners.61 Its last confused echo informs the quotation from Shway Yoe placed at the head of this article. The integral relationship between cult and polity in Ramaiifia favours the inference that the pahtheon of 37 passed to the Burmese from the Mons, and not in the opposite direction. Without this political support the nats took on a very different appearance from the sotdpan, even though the cult of Gavampati and the paramount legend of Zingyaik made the northward journey with them. I have suggested elsewhere62 that the nat cult was instituted at the behest of Anawrahta after the fall of Thaton. This is consonant with a tradition found in the same early chronicle as contains the sotdpan list, describing the Pagan king's efforts to annex the mana of the conquered city. 'The king of Arimaddana wished to take with him the image of the Buddha in royal array 59 Mus. op. cit., 383. 80 Epigraphia Birmanica, I, 2, No. I, c 23-5 : mahdjan gurhloh ci ... . de t'eh strak gigigii. 61 Martaban land roll of 1766 (MS). 62 ' The 32 myos...

H. Luce necessitate some qualification of my hypothesis. A strong mythological current is detectable in the crediting to Anawrahta-the first king of Pagan we can truly call historical-of the establish- ment there of Pali Buddhism, along with much else that contributed to the rise of the northern capital. On the basis especially of a chronological study of the Pagan frescoes, Professor Luce would transfer a good deal of this credit to Kyanzittha. He dates the Shwezigon pagoda shortly after 1086.64 But if Kyanzittha was the builder of the Shwezigon, Anawrahta cannot have deposited the images of the nats there as is traditionally asserted. It is likely that he was concerned in the introduction of the cult; but its consolidation may well have been the work of Kyanzittha, lord of Mon KyauksB, worshipper, as we have seen, of the 37, and one the ambience of whose court was prevalently Mon. We can, perhaps, now attempt an answer to the two questions posed at the beginning of this article. Why is information lacking on the corporate cult of the nats and on its mythology, properly so called ? Until Dr. Mendelson's paper of 1963, no one appears to have recognized the cult's public and official character-which admittedly emerges with most clarity from the Mon evidence now presented. (Dr. Htin Aung indeed dwelt on Anawrahta's role in the cult's history, but was misled by seeing him as concerned to suppress or subdue what had 'crystallized' apparently by a spontaneous popular process, and as exercising a permissive rather than a prescriptive function.) Such an official cult cannot survive the state whose purposes it subserves, as we have already noticed when considering the extinction of the sotdpan. The two among the conflicting lists of the 37 nats which receive most authority are the fossil end- products of Pagan and Mandalay revisions: the list recognized by the atten- dants at the Shwezigon, and that drawn up by the Myawadi Minister under Bodawhpaya. Our knowledge of the cults of the Mahagiri nat, the Taungbyon brothers, and others relates to the local and peculiar worship of these deities only. So large a corporation as the 37 would be unlikely to show the mythological coherence appropriate to a true pantheon; and imperfect assimilation of a borrowed cult might be thought adequate to explain the lack of details of this order in the traditions attaching to individual nats. But if the Stream-winners were in origin the local representatives of a class which had everywhere the same function, we would not expect to find them equipped with functionally differentiating myths. Here again an observation of Paul Mus's is instructive. A cadastral religion, he says, has ' dieux de la possession ', not ' dieux pour les aventures '; and if they have legends, these will be distinctive rather than explanatory."6 They will have, we might say, legends rather than myths. For the differentiation of territorial nats, thanatography is enough. 63 NR, 12. 64 The career of Htilaing Min (Kyanzittha) ', JRAS, 1966, 1-2, 64. 65 op. cit., 383.</page></plain_text>
