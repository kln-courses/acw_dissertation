<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROBERTA TUCCI AND ANTONELLO RICCI The Chitarra Battente in Calabria THIS article is based on the results of field-work in Calabria concerning the chitarra battente which we undertook during the years 1977-1983. During our research we were able to discover the area where it may be found, the production centres, its use, its repertory and the traditional playing techniques. At the same time we recorded a series of tapes and took photographs. Calabria is the region which occupies the southernmost tip of Italy. It is a long narrow stretch of land (about 15,000 km2) washed by the sea on three sides, and joined to the rest of the peninsula only by a small mountainous neck of land which is the boundary with Lucania. The region is divided longitudinally by the two mountain chains known as the Sila and the Serre which follow through to the south to reach the massifofAspromonte. The economy is still based on agriculture, sheep- farming and fishing. With the exception of a few restricted areas, industry is almost completely non-existent. The social and economic conditions - together with the fact that a large part of the population lived quite isolated lives until recently - have helped to preserve oral traditions among the peasants. Music plays an important role in this type of culture: it is a common heritage which survives as long as it is passed on orally according to the practices which regulate the creation, transmission and reception of culture in peasant societies. Creation is collective because - as the theoreticians of the Prague School have demonstrated2 - folklore is born the moment the creation is accepted by the community, independently of its origin. In an illiterate society, whatever is not accepted by the community has no possibility of surviving, while whatever is preserved and passed on is recognised as part of the cultural pattern with which the community identifies itself. So the music making of a folk player will embody the social customs which he himself passes on. These firmly established norms - which exclude any search for originality or novelty - lead to the continuity of traditional forms and models. They at the same time establish a framework in which a player can move. Within this framework it is possible not only to repeat and reproduce the traditional repertory, but also 'reinvent' it on the basis of a wide expressive liberty in which the 78</page><page sequence="2">social is united with the individual. In a similar way the moments of communication and reception of music in a culture with oral traditions greatly differ from those in a literate society. Communication is direct and internal, there being obviously no mass media, and its motivation springs more from impulses of a social nature than from aesthetic requirements. This music has functional characteristics: it is indispens- able on certain occasions, and furthermore each occasion requires a particular type of music, be it to help a baby to sleep, rhythmically to sustain agricultural labour, or to make people dance during a festivity. The listeners will differ therefore according to the occasion. All, however, share the same heritage of sounds which allows them to decipher musical messages and to respond with the appropriate reactions. Besides, the listener, in a certain sense, also participates in the execution and controls it. There is often a direct exchange between the player and the listener as may occur when the repertory is known to all. Even when specialisation exists and only certain members of the community are familiar with a specific repertory or a certain musical instrument, the listeners are equally able to verify and judge a performance. It is these social aspects (collective creation, the stability of the norm, the far greater importance given to social function as compared to aesthetic value, etc.) which clearly differentiate the music making of a peasant society from that of an industrial one. Correspondingly there is, on a musical plane, a way of organising sounds which goes beyond tonality and the western tempered system. Modal scales, microintervals, asymmetric structures, glissandi, timbres and particular emission of voice, which greatly differ from classical ones, archaic musical instruments etc. all combine to characterise this folk music as an autonomous product belonging to a 'different' culture. Nowadays, of course, the peasant folklore is not so totally detached from the development of Italian culture in general. The widespread diffusion of the mass media has reached the peasant world too, imposing upon it different musical forms, foreign to the traditional ones, and a way of life which does not allow a social function for music. Repertories, musical styles and genres are falling into disuse and remain only in the hands of the older generation. This phenomenon has also affected the peasant musical instruments which are closely linked to the traditional culture and folklore. In spite of this tendency our research in Calabria has found evidence of a certain persistence and vitality of these folk-musical instruments, many of which have marked archaic aspects and seem to be disappearing, if not already obsolete, elsewhere in Southern Italy. 79</page><page sequence="3">LUCANIA MAR IONIO Corigliano OBisignano 4 Lon Terravecchia I Bocchigliero , COSENZA ppadMesorc CATANZARO Davo li ODelianuova pSPROMOl~Z REGGIO CALABRIA S Area of the chitarra battente SArea of the chit.bat. with flat back 0 Production centres FIG. 1. Present distribution of the chitarra battente in Calabria. 80</page><page sequence="4">When dealing with folk instruments it is necessary to distinguish between 'home-made' and 'not home-made' ones. In the former case we refer to the instruments made in the same socio-economic environment in which they are subsequently played, most extremely when the player makes his own instrument, as is known to occur in the case of certain bagpipes, cane flutes, tambourines, etc. The latter case refers to instruments which are fabricated outside the socio-economic ambit in which they are to be played, for example instruments made industrially such as the diatonic accordion, brass-band instruments etc. The chitarra battente falls between these two categories. It is an instrument known to have a noble predecessor during the 17th century. Whether it was also used by the peasants at that time or whether it was acquired later is a question we shall leave for the music historians. In fact the distinction between autochthonous instruments and acquired ones remains a historical consideration, not an indication of the current use of the instrument. The chitarra battente is perfectly at home in peasant folk- music. We shall see later how it has evolved, as opposed to the more classical model, by a series of changes which have modified its original organological characteristics. On the other hand the peasants in Calabria consider it a native instrument, calling it simply the 'guitar', to distinguish it from what is generally known as a guitar, which for them is an imported instrument and known as 'the French guitar' which underlines its foreign origin. The chitarra battente was at one time found throughout the whole region.3 The inhabitants have assured us that this was so, and the assertion may be confirmed by the existence of the most important production centre in the South of Italy at Bisignano (province of Cosenza). Nowadays the area where the chitarra battente may be found is limited to the provinces of Cosenza and Catanzaro. The area, geographically, consists mainly of plains and hills which stretch from the Ionian Sea to the eastern watershed of the Sila mountain range (Fig. 1). The economy of this area is mainly agricultural but it enjoys a higher standard of living than others in the region. Within this area we can locate a particular zone where this instrument enjoys the greatest popularity, that is along the course of the Trionto river which has its source in the Sila and runs into the Ionian Sea, passing through Longobucco, a village which gives its name to alla lonnuvucchisa, the most well-known and characteristic song for the chitarra battente. The production centre of Bisignano is also found in this area. A simplified version of the chitarra battente with a flat back is found in an area to the south of the above-mentioned one, situated along an inland strip not far from the Ionian Sea in the province of Catanzaro 81</page><page sequence="5">(Fig. 1). Other minor production centres are found here, while another important centre is in Aspromonte, where, however, the instrument is now little used. The instrument has now disappeared from the remaining areas of Calabria although it still remains in the memory of many old people. One may call the players of the chitarra battente today 'professionals' in as much as they are the representatives and guardians of a special heritage. They are public figures who are called to play on particular occasions. This situation has come about due to the gradual decline of the chitarra battente which has led many of the players to abandon it and has almost prohibited the possibility of a new generation carrying on the tradition. Witnesses remember a far wider use of the instrument in times gone by. At present the ages of the chitarra battente players range from 45-50 to over 80. It is very rare to find a player under the age of 40. Traditionally women do not play the instrument but they may accompany it with the tambourine and may participate in the singing. HISTORICAL MODEL The chitarra battente4 is a cordophone belonging to the lute family. The seventeenth-century model can be seen in European and North- American Museums and it is widely described by historians of musical instruments. An It. form of guitar with characteristically deep body and highly arched back with rounded edges and slight waist. The belly is bent to form a slope just below the bridge. A large central soundhole is covered with a rose. The strings are rib-fastened, pass over a fingerboard with fixed metal frets to a flat pegdisc with rear pegs. (Marcuse 1964, p. 96.) In this species, in which the body normally has the vaulted form of back the belly is bent inwards at bridge level as in the Neapolitan mandolin and the wire strings are attached to hitch pins at the base. A protector plate may be fixed to the belly. The neck has fixed frets and the head may contain as many as 15 pegs, since any number of the five courses may be triple courses. (Baines 1966, p. 49.) The strings were let over the whole length of the table to the lower edge of the body, and the pegs were at right angles to the plane of the table. A slight sloping away of the table at its lower end, and the adoption of five courses of strings, which were plucked in the mediaeval fashion with a plectrum, were the remaining features of this atavistic instrument. (Geiringer 1949, p. 160.) The courses were double or triple, or the first double and the others triple (Gai 1969, p. 144). Mahillon gives the following tuning (1922, p. 144): a d' g' b' e" V IV III II I 82</page><page sequence="6">The fingerboard might have contained from 8 to 15 fixed metal frets or mobile gut frets (Gallini 1963, p. 130). and it often prolonged itself on the belly with another 4 or 5 wooden frets. The rose - which has been considered by many authorities on the subject the most distinguishing and particular feature of the instrument - might be a 'sunk rose with inlaid surround' (Baines 1966, p. 48), or a 'four-tiered deep rose of intricate design, with a sunburst in the centre and a small garnet on the top of it' (Bessaraboff 1941, p. 244). Also una caratteristica scatola in pergamena finemente traforata a piani concentrici digradanti, fissata ai bordi dell'apertura sonora e penetrante all'interno della cassa armonica. In questa scatola una rosellina di pergamena, fissata al fondo per mezzo di un filo di ferro, a spirale, vibra sollecitata dai suoni provenienti dall'interno della cassa. Questo artificio conferisce alla chitarra battente una sonorita tremula e vibrata, di una particolare efficacia espressiva.5 (Gallini 1963, p. 129.) Finally, the rich decoration of these seventeenth century instruments reflects the baroque taste of the period. FOLK CHITARRA BATTEN7TE The type of chitarra battente that we shall describe is a folk instrument, used by Calabrian peasants and made at Bisignano up until the early sixties at the workshop of Giacinto De Bonis and later at that of Espedito De Bonis. Like the seventeenth century model it has an elongated figure-of-eight shape, with a deep and narrow body, a slightly marked waist, very high sides, a vaulted back moulded with ribs, and rib- fastened wire strings. The chitarra battente is traditionally built in three sizes: large (chitarra), medium (mezza chitarra) and small (chitarrino) (P1. V b and c). The large one is the most widely used and best appreciated by the players, but the medium one is also used. The small one is a toy-instrument which in the past was used to train children in the tradition. CHITARRA The back and the sides are moulded with ribs from local walnut. The back is made of three ribs which extend for the whole length and four shorter ribs on the bouts. Thin fillets of light wood, usually poplar or chestnut, are placed between each of the five central ribs. The sides, which are very high, may also be moulded with ribs. However, they are generally made with a whole strip of wood, joining the back on the central bouts with one or two short ribs separated by fillets. Back and sides are internally strengthened with paper lining from newspaper. The players very often drill two little holes, called orecchie (ears of the guitar), 83</page><page sequence="7">in each side, at the point of the central bouts. This is done when the sonority of the instrument is not considered 'open' enough; the players say that the ears 'give vent' to the guitar. The soundboard of pine - sometimes of less suitable woods - runs a short way up the neck until the highest fret on the fingerboard. It is slightly bent inwards near the bridge. This curvature is made by removing a thin strip of wood from the inside of the belly, which is then bent with the aid of heat. The bars have a supporting function: there are seven of them, three of which are positioned sideways - above and below the sound-hole and just below the curve of the belly - and the remaining four are oblique - two at the upper bouts and two at the lower bouts (Fig. 2). The wooden bridge is mobile and is very shallow so that the strings lie very close to the belly. Because of this and the low string tension, the player is able to hit the strings and the wood at the same time: in such a way that it is possible to obtain the percussive and harmonic sound effect from which the instrument takes its name. The bridge is placed on the slope of the soundboard; it can be moved up or down a few millimetres in order to adjust the tuning but it cannot pass beyond the curve because there would then be a lack of pressure on the sound-board. O FIG, 2. Barring of the folk chitarre battenti. The rose is made of multi-coloured cardboard. It consists of a perforated ring with a scalloped inner edge; underneath the ring is glued a cylinder made of the same material, closed at the bottom and measuring about 2 cm in height and 4.5 cm in width. At the bottom centre of the cylinder a light cardboard 'flower' is fixed which reaches 84</page><page sequence="8">up to the opening. Paradoxically the rose which has often been considered the most characteristic feature of the chitarra battente is not appreciated by the Calabrian players, who generally prefer to liberate the soundhole in order to increase the resonance of the body. The neck is usually made of poplar and since it is sometimes joined to the body in a precarious way, the players use different methods of strengthening this joint, e.g. placing a tie-rod which connects the neck with the neck block. The fingerboard of rosewood has ten metal frets, the last of which is of half width, and a wooden nut. Some instruments have no fingerboard and in such cases the frets are directly inset in the neck. The pegboard is bent slightly backwards and drilled in order to accommodate the pegs, pirozzoli, which can be made from cherry, poplar or other types of wood and are lathe-turned. There are eight or seven pegs. In the first case the pegboard has an elongated rectangular shape, with two lines of four pegs (Fig. 3 c); in the latter case the pegboard has a more contracted shape and ends with a prolongation where a hole is pierced for the seventh peg (Fig. 3 a). '!// (a ):1(d) FIG. 3. Different pegboards of large size chitarre battenti. The chitarra battente has four wire strings, all of the same gauge (0.20 - 0.25 mm) and thinner than the high E of the guitar. The strings may be single and/or double: often the first one is double, less often the second and the fourth and hardly ever the third one. The strings are fastened to the lower rib by four hitch nails. A small cardboard rectangle is placed at right angles covering the base corner of the belly and so protecting the wood from the pressure of the strings. The makers make the strings from rolls of tempered steel bought directly from the factory, adjusting 85</page><page sequence="9">the length to the size of the instrument. The players used to buy the strings already cut in the village shops, but nowadays they can hardly ever find them. For this reason they often avoid doubling the strings, and, while waiting for wire replacements, may use anything they can find, e.g. bicycle brake wire. However, they do not think of replacing the wires with guitar high E strings which they consider improper for the chitarra battente. The difficulty of getting new strings may also be a cause of abandoning the instrument. A fifth central string, unfingerable, is often added. It is called scordino or cardiddu or terzino. The scordino has the same gauge as the other strings and is tensioned by a rear peg which pierces the fingerboard at the seventh fret. The decorations of the chitarra battente bring to mind the precious inlays of seventeenth century antique guitars, reinterpreted in a folk style. The belly is finished with red and blue floral patterns which are painted with paints prepared by the makers themselves. Three small bunches of flowers and leaves are depicted, one beginning from the centre of the base and one on each side of where the fingerboard is inserted. A wavy pattern of the same colours runs around the sound hole and the outer edge of the belly. Sometimes small shirt buttons are enamelled into the wood in the central nuclei of the flowers as mother- of-pearl inlays. The bridge is painted blue and the sides of the pegboard are painted blue and red. Besides these painted decorations one occasionally finds real wooden inlays obtained by insertions ofpurflings or simple geometrical patterns around the soundhole, on the finger board and on the pegboard (Pl. V a). In particular on the pegboard a V pattern is typical, obtained by fillets of alternating light and dark woods. In order to play standing up the players equip their instruments with shoulder-straps made of interlaced rope or even string. They fasten one end of their shoulder-strap to a nail fixed on the lower rib, and knot the other to the pegboard. If the strings are not all doubled, then the shoulder-strap is knotted in the place of one of the last pegs, which has been previously removed. If the player does not want to renounce the possibility of doubling the strings, he may tie the shoulder-strap to a ring screwed into the side of the pegboard or he may simply wrap and tie it around the pegboard between two pairs of pegs. Hanging from the ends of the shoulder-strap there may be coloured ribbons and tassels, which serve as ornaments, and also as apotropaic objects against the evil eye. The players often give anthropomorphic names or names taken from daily objects to parts of the instrument. The soundboard is called timpagno, a term used for ancient instruments, but also the name for a wooden disc which is used to press certain types of food (aubergines, 86</page><page sequence="10">anchovies, etc.) into suitable containers; the sides are called custera (ribs); the back cuoscino (hunch or hump); the bridge scanniello (stool).

The sides are made with whole strips of wood; in the joint with the back there is a short rib for each side on the central bouts. Soundboard, neck and fingerboard are in the same proportions as those of the large size guitar; the rose and the bridge are identical to it. The pegboard differs because it is shorter and dumpier, and it is drilled with six pegholes. Therefore only two strings may be doubled: the first and then either the second or the fourth one. Here, too, one of the last holes of the pegboard is often used to tie the shoulder-strap. Some older instruments may have pegboards for eight pegs, like the large size guitar. The medium chitarra battente may also have the scordino. The other features (materials, decorations, strings) are like those described for the large size guitar. Dimensions (in mm): Total length 895. Body: length 455; width of bouts 215, 160, 260. Sides: height, top 72, middle 124, bottom 80. Soundboard: distance from the base to the curve 100; diameter of sound-hole 78.

The belly is in proportion with that of the large size guitar. The rose is simplified and consists only of the ring of perforated cardboard scalloped at the inner edge. The fingerboard is missing and nine metal frets are set directly into the neck. The pegboard is of quadrangular shape and is drilled with four pegholes. The strings are single and the scordino is missing. The painted decorations are like those of the large size guitar. All features reveal a simplification of the instrument, since it is meant for children, not as a toy, but rather as a real musical instrument by which a first approach to music is possible. Recently the chitarrino has lost this original function and has become more and more a souvenir to be hung on walls. Dimensions (in mm): Total length 696.

The instrument only differs from the above described type in the number of the strings and in the pegboard. The pegboard, of very elongated rectangular shape, is longer and accommodates two rows each of five pegs (Fig. 3 b and d). A single or double central string is added to the four courses and it is called scordo. In the past the scordo was made of brass wire, which was commonly sold in the village shops. Nowadays it is very difficult to find this material, and therefore steel wire is more often used. It is worth noting that in folk chitarre battenti the bridge and the nut can be adjusted for four or five single or double strings: when necessary it is possible to cut more notches in the wood. The player himself is able to make final adjustments to his instrument according to his particular needs. For example, during our research we came across some chitarre battenti which were originally five-stringed - as the pegboards and the previous notches on the nut demonstrated - which had been transformed into four-stringed guitars, even with the addition of the scordino (Fig. 3 b and P1. Vf). In the five-stringed instrument the maker shows a clear intention to reproduce the historical type, while the four- stringed guitar may be considered a type revised by the peasants of Southern Italy. Generally in the past the five-stringed chitarre battenti were built on direct order from the players, while the four-stringed ones were sold at country fairs. This production of five-stringed chitarre battenti is closely linked with the name of the luthier Giacinto De Bonis (1882-1964); these instruments were made more with a view to a type of customer belonging to the village artisan group than to the peasant group. This distinction is also made within a culture based on oral traditions, where, even if on a smaller scale, various social-economic levels exist. Among the village artisan social-group the chitarra battente has been included in those typical ensembles called orchestrine di plettri (guitars, mandolins, etc.) that have a repertoire (romanze, operette, etc.) which requires a tonal use of the instrument. Nowadays these instrumental ensembles are becoming fewer and fewer and consequently the five-stringed chitarra battente is no longer much in demand. THE MAKERS In Calabria the original production centre of the chitarra battente is at Bisignano, a village in the province of Cosenza, where the luthiers De Bonis have been living and working since the eighteenth century.' In the 89</page><page sequence="16">past there were many productive workshops, divided between the different branches of the family. Today there are only two workshops left, which are owned by the remaining descendants, Vincenzo De Bonis and his cousin Espedito De Bonis. THE WORKSHOP OF VINCENZO DE BONIS This is the more important one as regards the history of the folk chitarra battente, even if the making of this instrument stopped in the sixties. During the eighteenth century the founder of this workshop made lutes, baroque guitars and chitarre battenti. In the nineteenth century mainly guitars, chitarre battenti and mandolins were produced. In particular Giacinto De Bonis (1882-1964) devoted himself to the chitarra battente and reached a very high level of folk handicraft. He also played the instrument and therefore could give advice to the players with whom he was on very familiar terms. The relationship between Giacinto and the players went far beyond basic buying and selling. They would meet either when the players went personally to Bisignano to order new guitars or to have their instruments repaired, or when the luthier set out (nearly always on foot) with his load of guitars on his way to the most important country fairs in the Ionian hinterland. The oldest players still have a vivid memory of Giacinto De Bonis and they often recall episodes of his life, such as when, after the country fair, he would be put up by some of them and at night, before going to sleep in front of the fireplace, they would play together; or when, along the hardest paths that led to mountain villages (before roads were built), he was helped by the women who are traditionally skilled in carrying loads on their heads, Even the instruments which have remained speak of Giacinto: they reveal a continuous research and improvement combined with a fine taste for finishings..The use of poor materials - as is often found in folk handicraft - is not a mark of a second-rate product, but is, on the contrary, a sign of great inventiveness and creativity. Giacinto De Bonis died in 1964; he had four sons. The youngest two, Luigi (b.1933) and Costantino (b.1937), abandoned their father's workshop and only kept up a desultory co-operation. Nicola (1918- 1978) and Vincenzo (b.1929) remained there but stopped making folk chitarre battenti in order to dedicate themselves, with great care, to the making of classical guitars and artistic pieces of luthery. They have received many national and international awards and prizes. Since 1978, when Nicola died, Vincenzo has been managing the workshop alone. As an artistic piece of luthery the chitarra battente has been produced (Pl. VI) in accordance with the family's ancient drawings, prints and 90</page><page sequence="17">moulds. In the last ten years this production has shown an increase in demand due to a growing interest in folk revival. The buyers are mostly city musicians who have taken an interest in Southern Italian folk music and have discovered this fascinating sonorous instrument. Vincenzo De Bonis makes two models ofchitarra battente. The cheaper one is made in co-operation with his brother Costantino and it comes in two sizes, large and small. The other is an instrument of artistic luthery, enriched with valuable woods, precious inlays and refined finishings; usually it is only made in the large size. Both models belong to a unique type which differs from the folk one in the following features: there are five double courses of strings; the body is not so deep; the back and the sides are made entirely with ribs which, since they are thinner, are consequently more numerous; all the materials are more valuable and the general finishing is more accurate. According to the value of the instrument, the ribs of the back and the sides can be of walnut, rosewood or ebony, with fillets of light local woods or maple (acero riccio). The belly is of red pine. The barring is similar to that of the folk model but some variations have been added to improve the acoustic effect (Fig. 5). The bridge of rosewood or ebony has definite notches for each string, either cut directly into the wood or into a narrow ivory or bone insert. FIG. 5. Barring of the chattare battenti made by Vincenzo De Bonis. The rose may vary greatly according to the degree of refinement of the instrument and the imagination of the maker. In the cheaper model the rose is made of cardboard covered with a silk-like material of 91</page><page sequence="18">different colours for the different parts. It has a similar shape to the rose of the folk chitarra battente, but it is made much more accurately. In more valuable instruments the roses can be made of silk, parchment or wood. They may have one, two or more levels, or may be in a cone which deeply penetrates inside the body, and so on. The neck is veneered with the same wood used for the back. The fingerboard of rosewood or ebony has 10 metal frets and a nut of wood, bone or ivory. The pegboard, veneered with the same wood as the neck, has an oblong rectangular shape and ends with a rounded point. It may also have an indented edge, like ancient guitars. The lathe-turned pegs may be of rosewood or ebony. The five double wire courses are rib fastened to five hitch nails or buttons of bone or ivory, which are fixed to a small rectangular plate attached to the upper edge of the lower rib. The decoration may vary greatly, according to the value of the instrument. In the cheaper model the decoration consists of a double purfling along the outer edge of the belly, a ring of alternate light and dark purflings around the soundhole, and the typical V pattern on the head. In the more valuable instruments there are a great many possibilities: for instance, inlays of valuable woods and mother-of-pearl on the belly, on the fingerboard and on the head. The inlays on the belly often reproduce a typical seventeenth century pattern: three small bunches of flowers, with three flowers in each bunch tied together by the stems, inlaid on the slope of the belly and two similar bunches inlaid in the area where the fingerboard is inserted. It is easy to note how the floral paintings on the soundboard of folk chitarre battenti are the 'poor' interpretations of this original pattern of inlays. Finally the instrument is french-polished with a spirit varnish. Large size dimensions (in mm): Total length 995. Body: length 490; width of bouts 235, 187, 287.

Using the tools inherited from his father, Espedito remains the last De Bonis who still makes the chitarra battente for present day folk music. However, his production has greatly declined in quality. Many instruments are made with unsuitable woods, soundboards too thick, badly glued on ribs, without fingerboards and badly finished. Few of his chitarre battenti actually play and most of today's buyers are wholesalers who resell the instruments at country fairs as souvenirs. Yet Espedito's production is variable. Among many rough instru- ments a more refined instrument may be produced, even with wooden inlays on the fingerboard and on the head (P1. V a). However, they are still very far from the beautiful guitars of Giacinto De Bonis, whose passing is still regretted by the old folk players. FOLK CHITARRA BATTENTE WITH FLAT BACK As we have seen, Bisignano is the original production centre of the chitarra battente in Calabria. However, minor centres also exist where the instrument is made in a simplified version and sold locally. One of the probable reasons these centres exist is that neither the De Bonis nor the wholesalers who used to buy from them were able to move out of a certain area and so satisfy the demand of the whole region. During the last 20 years diminishing production has made the situation worse, because the available instruments have been sold before they have been able to travel beyond the limits of Bisignano. But, of course, these are not the only reasons. We may imagine that minor centres have always existed. Carpenters have often found a way to raise their earnings making musical instruments, such as guitars, chitarre battenti, mandolins, at the same time using materials, tools and technical knowledge already in their possession. But without the moulds and, above all, without the luthier's experience and skill, they nearly always tended to eliminate one of the hardest construction problems: the vaulted back and the consequent rib working.8 This has occurred all the more since in the meantime the guitar, with its flat back, has become a widespread and familiar instrument. However, we wish to point out that these guitars with flat backs retain some of the distinctive features of the real chitarra battente. In fact they are considered as battenti by the players who make a distinction between them and the chitarra francese and use them with their own tuning, repertoire and playing style. 93</page><page sequence="20">MESORACA (P1. VII a and b) At Mesoraca, in the province of Catanzaro, the carpenter Nicola Lavorato makes a model of chitarra battente of similar shape to the traditional one, but with a flat back and not very deep body. The soundboard is generally of plywood but may also be pine or poplar, and is bent in the usual manner. Generally the rose consists of a disc of cardboard completely closing the soundhole. The mobile and low bridge is of beech-wood. The neck without fingerboard contains nine metal frets and a wooden nut. The pegboard is for eight knife-cut pegs of beech. The single or double wire strings are four or eight guitar high E strings (which can be easily found) rib fastened to four hitch nails. By request the maker provides a scordino, tensioned, as usual, by a rear peg at the seventh fret; the scordino may also be doubled and then a second peg is added at the fifth fret. The decoration of the belly recalls Espedito De Bonis' guitars. It is executed in red and green paints and consists of floral bunches and either wavy or scalloped or dotted patterns running around the edge, around the soundhole and along the curve. The sides of the soundboard are painted green. The instrument is rather badly finished and it is generally built in only one size. Dimensions (in mm): Total length 910. Body: length 450; width of bouts 235, 195, 270. Sides: height, top 95, bottom 75. Soundboard: distance from the base to the curve 110; diameter of soundhole 80. Neck: length 210; width at ends 50, 42. Pegboard: length 180; width at ends 50, 60. Vibrating length of strings 640. DAVOLI (Pl. VII c) In the area of the Serre, at Davoli, there is another minor centre where chitarre battenti are produced not only for the village but also for a wider area around it. The maker is named Concezio Cannatelli. These instruments with flat backs are made in two sizes, large and small, and show some similarities with the guitar: shape of body, height of sides, machine head, lack of rose. On the other hand they retain the bent belly, the four course wire strings of identical gauge (guitar high E strings) rib- fastened, the scordino and-the mobile bridge. The instrument is made with mediocre woods and it is rather roughly built. The fingerboard has eleven metal frets and a wooden nut. The head has six machines, only four of which are used, as the strings are not 94</page><page sequence="21">doubled. The scordino is tensioned as usual by a rear peg at the seventh fret. The fastening of the strings is strengthened by a metal plate attached at right angles to the belly and fixed to the rib. The back and sides are painted brown; the belly is decorated with a large coloured line along the edge and around the soundhole. In the Serre area players also convert industrially manufactured guitars into chitarre battenti. They choose 'third-guitars' with mobile string-fasteners attached to the lower ribs and they replace the original six strings with four high E strings. Even if these guitars are becoming more and more dissimilar to the historic model of chitarra battente, the players call them battenti and use them as such. DELIANUOVA (P1. VII d) At Delianuova, a village situated at the foot of the Aspromonte in the province of Reggio Calabria, there is a real lute-workshop, owned by Ricciotto Scutella. Scutella comes from the Sicilian school of luthery. He makes beautiful classical and folk guitars and mandolins, as well as a model ofchitarra battente which, in the past, met the demands in the area. Today this instrument is not much used in the Aspromonte area and is made only to order. The model of chitarra battente made at Delianuova shows even more similarities to the guitar. Besides the flat back, shape of the body, machine head and lack of rose, which we have already noted in the Davoli instruments, here the belly is not bent, and there is a real guitar fingerboard with 15 metal frets extending over the belly and reaching the soundhole. Moreover, the strings are fastened to the bridge which is glued to the soundboard. It is indeed a 'third-guitar' with some features deriving from the chitarra battente. The head has two rows of four machines which tension four double high E strings. There is also a scordino tensioned by a rear machine at the seventh fret. The instrument is refined and well finished. The belly is of pine, fingerboard of rosewood, nut and bridge-bar of bone. A plastic protector plate with a floral pattern of Sicilian origin is inserted in the wood of the belly and there are also purflings and small check inlays along the edge and around the soundhole. A light varnishing gives the finishing touch. Dimensions (in mm): Total length 860. Body: length 455; width of bouts 260, 220, 340. Sides: height, middle 85, bottom 80. Soundboard: diameter of soundhole 70. Neck: length 405, width at ends 50, 45. Pegboard: length 165; width 65. Vibrating length of strings 575. 95</page><page sequence="22">MUSICAL CHARACTERISTICS AND PLAYING TECHNIQUES TUNING Four-stringed model , -,, 7- Five-stringed model Z0L 34 " 5"- EX. 1. The strings of the chitarra battente are tuned in a re-entrant system where the progression from bass to treble is not followed. So, in the four- stringed model the second string is lower than the third; while in the five-stringed model the second is lower than the fourth and the third is the lowest of all. Almost all the scale intervals are not tempered and this, together with the slackness of the very fine wire strings and the particular way of playing chords, produces an indefiniteness in the tuning and a particular sound, rich with harmonics. The real pitch of the instrument may vary according to the voice the instrument must accompany or according to the various accompanying instruments. As regards the four-stringed model, it is the third string which determines the tonality of the instrument and this generally varies from F# to Bb. The fourth string is never fingered and gives a drone (the dominant) which may be doubled with its higher octave if the scordino is also used. In the five-stringed model, it is the fourth string which decides the tonality while the unfingered fifth string produces the dominant drone. The central string is the scordo which, being tuned very low, gives the impression of an out of tune or dissonant note, an impression which is reinforced by the use of brass strings. The presence of the central string gives a wider range of harmonic possibilities; therefore (as has already been noted) the five-stringed model is able to be adopted for music 96</page><page sequence="23">other than strictly folklore. On the other hand the four-stringed model is an example of the adaptation of this instrument to the modal structure of Calabrian peasant music. In fact when the central string is eliminated the range of the instrument is limited to a fifth, which is the backbone on which a very large part of South Italian music hangs. The presence of the scordino, which is in fact really a drone, since it is not fingerable, further excludes the possibility of modulation. So the scordino, even though it takes its name from the term scordo, should not be considered a simplification of the original central string but more as an element with its own particular function. In fact it is also called cardiddu, a term which indicates the high drone of South Italian bagpipes. POSITIONS OF THE LEFT HAND As a rule only the first three frets are used; however, the more accomplished players have developed melodic phrases and adopted grace notes covering almost the entire fingerboard. The index finger and the middle finger are used for holding chords while the other two are used for grace notes. The two basic chords: a- b EX. 2. are graced and enriched with appoggiature, acciaccature, mordents, etc.: Ask iM I All. a a -aW EX. 3. (0 = notes belonging to the chord. 0 = grace notes.) The use of additional grace-notes is strictly improvised and in relation to style and preference for micro-variation. A large part of the instrument's repertoire is based on these two major chords, but the various local styles create many variants. In the tunes in a minor key the 97</page><page sequence="24">tonic chord becomes: mat As EX. 4. while the dominant remains unaltered. Chord positions which create a wider harmonic atmosphere - that is to say chords which are neither specifically major or minor - are often used. In fact it is not unusual while playing the major tonic chord to leave out the third so as to give a certain freedom to the melody - either sung or played on another instrument - and to add brief phrases in a minor key. The following position: 4ULLL EX. 5. may be used as the tonic chord instead of the one in Ex. 2 a. It is worth noting that the second note of the scale is doubled, thus giving it a greater emphasis which adds to the harmonic indefiniteness of the chord. The complete form of the dominant chord is almost always used during chord changes to underline certain modulations of the voice; it often takes the form of a dominant seventh. The dominant note is always present as the drones are sounded continuously. TECHNIQUE OF THE RIGHT HAND This is of great relevance in the playing of this musical instrument and is moreover the part of the playing technique which demonstrates the most outstanding characteristics. The peasant players do not use a plectrum, only fingers. The movements used to create different rhythmic and sound effects are multiple: one may use just the index finger on a single string, usually the first, for brief melodic units; or all the fingers may be used together rubbing on the surface of the strings; or plucking the strings with one 98</page><page sequence="25">finger after another; or beating the strings and the soundboard at the same time, thus creating the harmonic and percussive effect which gave the name to the instrument and which in dialect is known as ribbummu. At intervals the player leaves the strings and beats the soundboard of the guitar with a 'flicking' of the index and middle fingers which usually coincides with the strong beat of a phrase. Another frequent technique used in playing the chitarra battente is a circular hand movement which springs from the wrist: the hand starts above the instrument and makes a downward stroke brushing the strings with the backside of the fingers, the thumb following and the hand returning upwards again with the index finger. These three movements played rapidly with the correct accent create the triplet. All the above techniques may be combined to create a mixture of movements, thus increasing the expressive possibilities and enabling the player to emphasise and sustain various moments of the songs or dances. SOME OBSERVATIONS ON RHYTHM The most frequent rhythmic beat is 2/4, but during execution the rhythm undergoes certain elaborations. First of all, there is no strict division between the tonic and the dominant (1/4 for the tonic and 1/4 for the dominant), since the latter, being used frequently in chord changes, is played for shorter musical beats than the tonic. The beat is often subject to ternary subdivisions expressed by triplets, which, as has already been noted, are obtained by a circular movement of the right hand; otherwise one may find some less explicit figures, such as: _n 1~2~ EX. 6. which conceal the tendency of the rhythm to oscillate ambiguously between a binary and a ternary subdivision. VOCAL AND INSTRUMENTAL COMBINATIONS The chitarra battente is used to accompany both male and female voices, rarely for monodic singing, more often for alternating voices or polyphonic performances. It is also used together with other musical instruments. The most popular ensemble is with other stringed instruments: the regular guitar (called the French guitar by these players as mentioned above), the 99</page><page sequence="26">mandolin and less frequently the violin. For membranophones the most frequent combination is with the tambourine; for the idiophones it is with castanets which may be substituted by a simple clapping of hands. It is not so easy to cpmbine the chitarra battente with reed instruments (zampogna, ciaramella, diatonic accordion), due to the greater difference in sound volume. The combination of instruments is neither casual nor improvised but is established by the traditional norms, which the players consciously carry on. So, besides the more strictly musical characteristics, the vocal and instrumental combinations also contribute to the definition of the various local styles which all add to the repertory of this instrument. REPERTORY Traditionally the chitarra battente is used to accompany songs and dancing and it is not much used as a solo instrument. The instrument's repertory includes: songs a strofette, quest songs, polyvocal songs and tarantelle. A STROFETTE SONGS This form of song is the most typical in the repertory of the chitarra battente. There are various local styles, which are named after their places of origin, for example, alla lonnuvucchisa from Longobucco, alla terravecchjisa from Terravecchia, alla bocchiglierisa from Bocchigliero, a cire from Corigliano, etc. The most representative and widespread of these is alla lonnuvucchisa. A strofette (little strophes) indicates a style in which two voices alternate using a fixed pattern: the first voice sings the strophe and the second repeats it and concludes it. So the strophe and its echo form the smallest unit of the song. The sung strophe is the result of a continuous taking apart and putting together of basic hendecasyllabic couplets. For example: rosa russa di la verde spina culonna di si nobilifuntana (red rose with green thorn column of this noble fountain) becomes: First voice: Oi rosa russa di la verde spina culonna di si no' oi culonna di si no culonna di si nobili funtana e nobili funtana e culonna di si no' nobili funtana Second voice: Oi verde spina oi verde spina oi culonna di si no' culonna di si no' culonna di si nobili funtana e nobilifuntana 100</page><page sequence="27">The singer may in various ways make changes to the original text adding his or her personal addition. So by repetition and variation of the repetition, two important functions are carried out: the mnemonic one - necessary to cultures with oral traditions - and the expressive one, both of which may find parallels in the blues. With careful analysis each performance of a song is unique and unrepeatable. The a strofette songs in a certain sense belong to a kind of 'language' by which it is possible to communicate. The contents, however, are only intelligible to those who belong to that culture, because the true message is disguised within a stereotyped form or metaphor. The songs may be greeting songs or departure songs, friendship songs or serenades. The last served an important role in social relationships, being the only 'codified' way for young people to make contact. Today, of course, the different way of life has changed this aspect. However, the other aspects of the a strofette songs still live in the music of the Calabrian peasants. Musically the a strofette songs have several common factors: the major tonality, the singing of alternating voices, the descending melodic phrases, and the beginning which is almost always on an off-beat. The style alla lonnuvucchisa is accompanied only by the chitarra battente. The characteristics of this style are: an abundance of embellishments, the inclusion of all the techniques of the right hand, a swinging rhythmic progression with slight retardation in the beats striking the body (of the guitar) and a slight anticipation of the returning-up of the hand in the circular movement. This helps to make such a playing technique fascinating, which otherwise, having neither a large harmonic range nor a particular rhythm, would be quite poor. The style alla bocchiglierisa is a song accompanied both by the chitarra battente and the French guitar playing together. The chitarra battente is tuned in a particular way: EX. 7. The combination of the two instruments is accomplished by a bass accompaniment and quick chords strummed on the guitar while the chitarra battente alternates its typical 'rubbed' style with a few melodic phrases. It is important to note the difference in time between song accompaniment (slow and elongated) and the fast tarantella-like intermezzi. 101</page><page sequence="28">The style a cire is also accompanied by the mandolin. The chitarra battente plays a very regular 2/4 rhythm which, however, also has swing. The two instruments play together with the mandolin superimposing a three beat rhythm over the two beat rhythm of the chitarra battente. QUEST SONGS These are tied to the rituals performed on special occasions such as Christmas, New Year, Epiphany, Carnival, Easter, May Day - the annual festivities tied to the various turning points in the agricultural year. An important part of these rituals is the questua where under good auspices gifts of food are sought from house to house in and around the village. Both the request for food and well-wishing are communicated in the songs, which may be accompanied by instruments such as chitarra battente, bagpipes, diatonic accordion, accordion, tambourine, friction drum, etc. So these songs, though not exclusive to the chitarra battente, are an important part of its repertory and are performed mainly at Christmas and Easter. Nowadays, however, they have mainly lost their original function. The text consists of a large number of strophes which have to be sung according to an established order (for example, first strophes contain greetings to the house, second strophes greetings to the inhabitants and so on till the last strophes which give the farewell). Repetition and variation is found, making it possible to adapt the strophe to the situation in these songs too (for example, personal greetings or well- wishing), and also to improvise on not strictly traditional themes (for example, best wishes for receiving a degree in Rome for students). Among the questua songs we find the cozzupara, which is sung on Easter night. The chitarra battente, while accompanying the song, sung by two alternating voices, with the minor tonic chord, plays an interesting rhythm. The voices freely enter into a 4/4 rhythmic beat which is repeated with micro-variations maintaining a descending melodic phrase which begins on the minor third, passes to the fourth, then to the second ending again on the minor third. POLYVOCAL SONGS The chitarra battente is also used to accompany polyvocal songs called all'aria or all'aria nova, for two or more voices, which are more often sung without instrumental accompaniment. In the vocal version they are elongated songs, with 'outspread' voices typical of Southern Italy which are sung by groups of singers working in the fields. In the version accompanied by the chitarra battente, the song changes its use and destination, becoming an evening serenade. These songs were an 102</page><page sequence="29">important part of the chitarra battente's repertory; today, unfortunately, as they are tied to an archaic form of song, they are falling into disuse. The chitarra battente is usually played with a 'free rhythm' using the right hand in the circular movement described above. However, the other movements are also used and combined together in an interesting way, so as to be able to sustain and accompany the outbursts of song, usually in a minor key, with a continuous formation and deformation of rhythmic figures, displacements of the downbeat, etc. In a similar way the chitarra battente accompanies other non-polyvocal elongated songs in a minor key. THE TARANTELLA This is the traditional dance of Southern Italy. Contrary to many of the oleographic images printed during the 19th century or the way in which folk groups portray it, the tarantella is a forceful pagan dance full of sensuality and challenge. It is performed mainly on festive occasions, yet being an extremely vivacious and habitual dance among the Calabrian peasants, it is never lacking even in everyday music making. Both in its instrumental form and in the vocal-instrumental version the tarantella seems a rhythmic acceleration of the a strofette songs. It is based on the two principal chords but the possible variations are numerous and range from the usual embellishments in the first position to progressions along the fmingerboard following the alternating pattern of tonic and dominant chords, and thus creating contemporaneously a melodic phrase descending from the dominant to the tonic with the final cadence falling on the leading-note. Whereas it is possible to find tarantelle in a minor key, the majority are in fact in a major key.
