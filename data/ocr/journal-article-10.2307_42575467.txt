<plain_text><page sequence="1">Don L. F. Nilsen* LITERARY DEVICES IN ADVERTISING t Many are in people school, in and the cease united to read states anything study of literature the nature while of Belles they are in school, and cease to read anything of the nature of Belles Lettres as soon as they stop attending school. But no literate person in the United States stops reading advertisements until s/he reaches the stage when s/he does not read at all. In a very real way, advertisements are sort of the folk literature of all Americans. Recently, with the aid of Alleen Pace Nilsen, who teaches courses in children's and adolescent literature at ASU, I've begun to wonder if evidence could be collected supporting the thesis that advertisers are great writers. To collect evidence for this thesis, I assigned two of my grammar classes to collect samples of literary devices in advertising. I realize that literary devices can be used not only by great writers, but also by mediocre writers and even bad writers, but they nevertheless represent a level of sophistication and awareness that is not normally attributed to writers of advertising copy. Whether these uses of liter- ary devices make the advertising copy into literature, into doggeral, or into something in between is a decision that will have to be indepen- dently made by each of the readers of this article. The particular samples of literary devices that my students and I have collected can be placed into four categories: (1) Phonology and orthography, (2) Syntax and morphology, (3) Semantics and meta- phor, and (4) Mixture (usually a mixture of phonology and seman- tics). t The tone of this presentation is basically positive. To see the same devices analyzed from a more negative point of view (using different examples), please see my "Deviation as Doublespeak," Teaching English in the Two-Year College, Vol. 3, No. 3 (Spring 1977), pp. 159-165. The TETYC article mentions a number of literary devices not mentioned here. * Don L. F. Nilsen is a professor of Linguistics at Arizona State University at Tempe. 143</page><page sequence="2">144 Et cetera • SUMMER 1980 A literary type that is basically phonological in nature is rhyme. This can be viewed as alliteration coupled with assonance. There are four types of rhyme represented in advertising. Three of these are en- tirely phonological in nature - masculine rhyme, feminine rhyme, and slant rhyme; the fourth type is orthographic in nature - eye rhyme. Masculine rhyme is an extremely common device in advertis- ing. Wanting his readers to enter a contest to come to Hollywood and appear on American Bandstand, Dick Clark invites them to "Win a Skinny Dip Trip." Colony House makes cookware that is "for the gourmet . . . and everyday." And Sears advertises that "In our pants you can crouch without saying 'ouch.' " Whereas with masculine rhyme it is the final syllable that is both rhymed and stressed, in feminine rhyme it is the first syllable that is stressed. It is surprising that there are a fair number of examples of feminine rhyme in advertisements. Cover Girl Eye Makeup adver- tises, "Jeepers, look at my peepers!" An Impala (GM) ad reads, "It runs leaner, It runs cleaner." And Congoleum has a floor covering by the name of "Shinyl Vinyl." A margarine advertises, "Everything's better with Blue Bonnet on It!" We need a fairly broad definition of feminine rhyme so that it will include any rhyming words not stressed on the final syllable. With this extended definition we would be able to include not only the "bonnet-on it" example above, but also a series of ads for Sony electronic equipment such as "Pepperoni and Sony," "Marconi, meet Sony," and "Sony and Matrimony," which goes on, "There's blues on Joany's Sony. There's Vida Blue on Tony's Sony," and which ends with "$59.95 buys this Sony. It's a lot less than alimony." Not only do advertisers have an ability to use feminine rhyme in their ads along with masculine rhyme, but in addition they even may know what these processes are called. An ad for Figure Con- trol Ine . , which is an organization designed to help people lose weight , asks, "Why be a fat cat? When you can be a skinny minnie?" and the ad pictures a masculine-looking fat cat with a feminine-looking skinny minnie. Slant rhyme is also called half rhyme or imperfect rhyme. Lark cigarette company has "Smoothness you can taste from a filter you can test." In Scottsdale, Arizona there's an establishment that makes eye- glasses named the "Optique Boutique," and a restaurant named the "Purple Turtle." There are three other types of sound-repetition literary devices which are syntactic as well as phonological in their nature. The first of these is anaphora, which can be defined as the repetition of a word or phrase at the beginning of successive clauses. This device is quite fre- quent in advertising, as can be seen in "Come to where the flavor is. Come to Marlboro Country," "People start pollution. People can stop</page><page sequence="3">Literary Devices in Advertising 145 it," or "We are the Garrard Engineers who made the Zero 100. We are the Garrard Engineers who are going to sell it to you." Sometimes there is a repetition of two elements, and the second occurrence is the inverted counterpart of the first. This is called Chiasmus, and can be seen in such ads as the one for Paul Masson's wines, "When you're good to the land, the land is good to you." As a final example of a sound-repetition literary device that is used in advertising let us consider the process named Polyptoton. This is a device whereby the repeated word is of the same root, but the parts of speech (and therefore the suffixes of the word) are different from one occurrence to the next. The one example I was able to find of this pro- cess is for Morton salt. It reads as follows: "Who softens your softener while your softener is busy softening the water?" Most literary devices are metaphorical in nature, and are therefore more in the domain of semantics than in the domain of phonology, orthography, morphology, or syntax. Since metaphor (in the narrow sense of the term) is probably the most frequent and the most impor- tant of literary devices, let me spend some time with this concept. Metaphor is the process whereby one thing has semantic features in common with another thing, and whereby the one is used in the place of the other. In order to keep some track of semantic features, let us consider a hierarchy of features which has been developed recently by linguists who were interested in explaining the breaking of concur- rence restrictions in sentences - a metaphorical process which is developed by placing words in a sentence next to other words with which they are semantically incompatible, as in the sentence "Color- less green ideas sleep furiously." A simplified form of the hierarchy of features which they have developed can be represented as follows: God Human Animal Plant Concrete Often the process of metaphor involves a change of status from one level of this hierarchy to another level. The metaphorical process whereby something is given Godlike qualities is known as deification. The process of giving something human qualities has two names, de- pending on what it was before it was given the human qualities. The metaphorical change of God to Human is called anthropomorphism, and the metaphorical change of anything below Human to Human is known as personification. The process of changing from something abstract to something concrete is known as reification. As far as I</page><page sequence="4">146 Et cetera • SUMMER 1980 know, there are no literary terms for the metaphorical process of changing something into a plant or into an animal (though these are common processes); therefore, for the purposes of this article, I'll coin the terms "animalification" and "planification." In considering deification, let me give examples that show that even this level can be subdivided into subleveis. First there is "angelifica- tion," as exemplified by the ad for Contura-Lite lightweight shears, which names their lightweight shears the "Blue Angels." There's deification in the direction of god with a small g as the ad which reads simply, "Suicide: The savage god." Finally there is all-the-way deifi- cation as represented in the ad by Sansui Electronics Corporation for the universal 4-channel receiver which is called "Quad Almighty." All of the examples I've collected of anthropomorphism begins as gods with a small g. There is a company that makes ladies' dresses called Persephone, which advertises, "Persephone presents a cool number." The royal Viking Steamship Line advertises, "On October 5, the new Vikings discover where Apolla was born," and in an adver- tisement for Deutsche Grammaphone records, Beethoven is described asa". . . Titan wrestling with the gods." This last example is both an example of deification (Beethoven becoming a Titan), and anthropo- morphism (Titans and gods wrestling). Personification, also known as pathetic fallacy, is the most frequent of the metaphorical devices used by ad writers. The personifica- tion can be accomplished by modifiers, as in the ad for Clairol's Herbal Essence Shampoo which reads, "Your hair will get very, very ex- cited," and such product names as "Brave" and "Bold" which are normally human- type adjectives. The personification can also be ac- complished through nouns, as with a perfume by Revlon named "Charlie," and as with an ad for a new product from Clairol which is presented with the phrase, "Announcing our new Baby." Verbs can also be used in the process of personification, as when Newport cigar- ettes are described as being "... alive with pleasure," and Kraft ad- vertises "... the can that thinks it's a wedge of cheese." Animalification is most often accomplished in advertisements with product names. There is the "Jaguar," the "Beetle" by Volkswagen, the Ford "Mustang," Keds' "Grasshoppers," and even John Deere tractors have an ad that reads, "Nothing runs like a Deere." Occasion- ally, animalification is accomplished in the verb part of a sentence, as in the ad for General Motor's Hatchbacks which reads, "Look what Oldsmobile hatched," or the ad which reads, "You'll go ape over the Sound of Koss." Since only animals can be born, the use of this modi- fier for non-animals results in animalification, as in the case of "Earth-Born" shampoo, or the ad for Norell which is described as "the first great perfume born in America." Animalification can even</page><page sequence="5">Literary Devices in Advertising 147 be accomplished through the creature use of prepositional phrases, as in the ad for Sprinkler Shops which reads, "Put your hoses out to pas- ture." Although I'm using the term somewhat facetiously, there is also a metaphorical process called "Plantification." This can be seen in the ad for Republic Steel Buildings that reads, "You expect your business to grow. Can you expect the same of your building?" It can also be seen in the wallpaper ad that tells you to "wake up outdoors in a meadow filled with flowers," and in the Christmas Kodak ad which pictures a large family forming a Christmas tree, each of them holding a camera. The caption reads, "For your family tree." And it can also be seen in the ad for Soft-Weve toilet paper containing a blossom de- sign which reads, "Soft-Weve has Blossomed." The metaphorical process of reification is much more difficult to find in advertisements, but can be seen for example in such perfume names as "Sachet," and "Wind Song." Sometimes in the metaphoring process the types of fea- ture transfer are not as drastic as those we've suggested above. With- out violating the hierarchical levels outlined above, it is possible to have metaphors within the same level. For example, it is possible to describe one concrete thing by giving it the name of another concrete thing. By doing this Sony can advertise their three-band portable radio containing numerous gauges and dials as "the Cockpit." Sometimes by design, and sometimes by accident, the metaphors in advertisements become mixed. There is a famous company which has a brand of orange which is called the "Top Banana"; this is described as being "Plumper. Prettier. Sweeter. Richer. Tastier. The Sunkist Navel," which not only metaphorically mixes one kind of fruit (orange) with another (banana) but goes so far as to mix an orange peel with a person's skin (both have a navel). In another ad "Liquid Plummer" is described as a "heavyweight." Another metaphorical process used in both literature and in adver- tising is synecdoche, whereby the part represents the whole. Conti- nental Airlines hás an ad which reads, "See Continental move its tail to Miami." There is an ad for Kijafa, a cherry wine from Denmark, which is a little more sophisticated. There is a picture of a bottle and a glass of Kijafa cherry wine and a young innocent-looking girl with the caption, "Put a little cherry in your life." Similar to the metaphorical processes of synecdoche is the process of apostrophe. It is through this device that an advertiser selects a cer- tain segment of his audience to address. It can be seen in the ad for Glidden Spred Satin paint: "Sorry Sears, PPG, Sherwin-Williams, Lucite, and Dutch Boy . . . Spred Satin Wins!" In the metaphorical process of representing one thing as something else, perhaps the most common type of transfer is Synesthesia,</page><page sequence="6">148 Et cetera • SUMMER 1980 whereby one of the senses metaphorically takes the place of a different sense. There can be a transfer from any one of the five senses (touch, taste, sound, sight and smell) to any of the other senses. UTA French Airlines' "Drink in the color" goes from taste to sight; a recording tape company's "Heard any good books lately?" goes from sight to sound; and Faberge's ad which refers to "The Erogenous Tones" goes from feel to sight. Simile is like metaphor except that the "like" or "as" has the effect of making the transfer into a non-contradiction. It is a common meta- phorical device in advertising. Canada Dry says, "A good club soda is like a good woman: it won't quit on you." The Mon Petit beauty salon in Phoenix says, "We cut hair like porcupines cuddle . . . very care- fully!" Almadén wines says, "Grapes, like people, need time to rest." And in advertising a new book, the Sancho Educational Enterprises (which has that name because it's a "quixotic" press), says, "Chris- tians are like tea bags: You don't find out what they are like until you dunk them in hot water." A great deal of figurative language gains its special effect by the interplay of the semantic features in ways which either reinforce or contradict the metaphor. Such figurative devices as epithet, allusion, parody, travesty, and farce depend on feature reinforcements. An ad- vertisement for the Tourist Organization of Thailand refers to Thai- land epithetically as the "golden heart of Asia." The Datsun pickup truck is personified by the epithet "Li'l Hustler." Allusion has the ef- fect of packing a great deal of information into a little space. A quick thumbing through any yellow pages will provide numerous allusions to mythological characters such as Bacchus, Pegasus, Venus, Mer- cury, Atlas, Hercules, Midas, Jupiter, and many others. Advertisers also frequently allude to the Bible, as in the "Adam and Eve Beauty Salon" in Phoenix; the Lady Arrow Shirt, which is described as "the best offer from Eve since the apple"; and the RCA statement explain- ing how satellites keep a vigil over the planet and its ecology with the statement, "Satellites have taken up where Noah left off." There are allusions to sports such as the one for French's Bel-air cheese and gar- lic croutons that says, "Send a great team to the bowl"; allusions to literature, such as the ad for Security Pacific Bank which says, "If we had managed Scarlett O'Hara's account, Tara might not have gone with the wind," allusion to holidays, such as the ambiguous statement advertising Beefeater Gin, "This is the season for the man in the red suit and the white beard," allusion to historical events, such as the ad by Oneida Silverware introducing a new design called Louisiana, and referring to it as "The Great Louisiana Purchase," allusion to televi- sion shows, such as the ad for the Phoenix Greyhound Park billed as "our Tonight Show," allusion to historical places, such as the luxury</page><page sequence="7">Literary Devices in Advertising 149 soap by Laurent Frères of Belgium called "Waterloo," allusions to famous historical figures, such as, "If Mozart were alive today, he'd be recording on 'Scotch' brand recording tape"; or even allusions to the dogs of famous historical figures, such as, "How we gave Fala the run of Hyde Park during World War II. Or why ADT burglar alarms only bug burglars." If the allusion is to a piece of writing, and if it is done by burlesque- ing or exaggerating the style, it is called parody. There is an ad that goes, "Walter's in the kitchen with Lawry's." Another alludes to a dif- ferent song, "The Old Detergent ain't what it used to be." Another reads, "To live . . . perchance to dine," and still another says, "Lend us your ears and JVC will give you a true 4-channel demonstration quadradisc." Perhaps the most often parodied passage is one from Shakespeare beginning with, "To be or not to be, that is the ques- tion." It is on the basis of this that Clairol asks, "To frost or not to frost," the book Winning Through Intimidation asks, "To be intimi- dated or not to be intimidated? - That is the question," Vantage cigarette company asks, "To smoke or not to smoke." Virginia Slims Cigarette Company parodies not a particular literary piece, but a par- ticular style of writing as they say, "And as they rode off into the sun- set, the prince promised her his love, his riches, and his castle in the clouds if only she would be his." This last example is such an exagger- ation of style that it could almost be called travesty. Buick has an ad with even more exaggeration, and one which therefore must be called travesty. It is entitled "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Opel," and it reads as fol- lows, "It is late Saturday night. The mysterious clanking noises from within the Doctor's chambers have subsided. And it is very quiet." The writing continues until later we gradually discover that what is being transformed is a Buick Opel. Although both travesty and farce have the effect of making the reader smile and comment "No, that's not possible," this effect is achieved in very different (perhaps opposite) ways in these two genres. For the travesty, the semantic features of the words exaggerate so much in reinforcing each other that the result is unbelievable because it's too much. For the farce, the semantic features of the words gener- ally contradict (rather than reinforce) each other. Consider, for exam- ple, this ad for Jose Cuervo tequila: "A ski instructor from Tahoe wrote us that he really enjoys a nice hot glass of Gorilla Sweat after a brisk afternoon on the slopes. However, he went on, he doesn't think he'll ever develop a taste for the name. To that, we can only say 'Name Schmame!' Just take 2 ounces of Cuervo, a pat of butter, a clove of clove, pour in scalding water, toss in a cinnamon stick, stir briskly, and drink heartily. Frankly, we don't really mind what you call Gorilla Sweat. As long as you swallow this story."</page><page sequence="8">150 Et cetera • SUMMER 1980 To a large extend it is through the skilled use of satire and irony that a farce is developed. A satire is intended to show the vices, follies, stupidities and abuses of men. Typically there are two meanings, and sometimes the meanings are opposite each other; consider the ad placed in a magazine by the American Medical Association entitled, "How to kill yourself." It reads as follows: "Eat! Drink! And be Merry? And whatever you do, by all means, over do it. Eat! It gives you something to do when you're bored or tense .... Drink! You don't really need it to unwind. It's just to be sociable." and so on. Very frequently it's impossible to tell that something is satirical without de- termining who is sponsoring the ad. Benson and Hedges talks about the "disadvantages of our longer cigarette." Xerox tells you "How to make it small in business." Teacher's Scotch tells us that, "We feel dutybound to remind everyone again that, in strictest point of fact, we have actually settled on Tuesday as the official, approved day for drinking Teacher's. In consequence the Wednesday, Thursday, Fri- day, Saturday, Sunday and Monday enjoyment of Teacher's must be technically considered unauthorized." They end their ad with, "Thank you for your lack of cooperation." Irony is another type of figurative language that is based on semantic-feature incom- patibilities. I assume that there is also irony in the name of a beauty salon in Phoenix, which is "The Ugly Duckling." There are a number of figures of speech that are based on feature incompatibilities. Antithesis plays on the opposite meanings of words or phrases. Andersen Perma-Shield advertises "New fangled windows with old-fashioned character." Litotes is a figure of speech whereby something is expressed by a negation of the contrary. The Regency Hyatt in Acapulco is described as "un-American." The Arizona Bank is "not the biggest bank in town." Crow Light whiskey is "Not a Bourbon. Not a blend. Not a Canadian .... Not a pale imitation of anything." The Yashica electronic camera "isn't just another status symbol." The Oxymoron is a figure of speech in which two contradic- tory terms are combined. There's a furniture company in Washing- ton, D.C. called the Door Store that advertises "Chinese Chippen- dale." J.W. Gibson company has a pain-relief medicine named "Icy-Hot." When the incompatibility is apparent rather than real, the result is a paradox. American Airlines shows a picture of a lady sun bathing with the caption, "Get out of the kitchen and bake." Volvo autos show a picture of some manikins used to test the impact of Volvo crashes on people, and there is the caption, "It takes a lot of dummies to design a car for people who think." The National Center for Voluntary Action says, "Work for free. The pay is great." And Listerine mouth wash has a picture of a lady saying, "I hate it, but I love it."</page><page sequence="9">Literary Devices in Advertising 151 Anachronism is another figure of speech which is based on con- tradiction of semantic features. The words "ho," "thou," "thyself," "auld," and "olde" are anachronistic in the ad for covered wagon va- cations called "Wagons Ho," that for the North Bank restaurant showing a loaf of bread and a bottle of wine and the words, "All we need is thou," that for Kraft Cheese saying, "It's Auld Lange Syne," and that for Gordon's gin reading, "We still use our centuries-old pot still method." Understatement, overstatement, and purple passage are three addi- tional types of figurative language in which there is some amount of semantic-feature incompatibility, not so much in the denotative fea- tures as in the connotative features. There is a dishwashing detergent which pictures tables and chairs and place settings going on as far as the eye can see with the caption, "We're expecting a few extra people for dinner tonight." A peace movement advertises, "War is not healthy for children and other living things," an anti-abortion group advertises, "Abortion is not good for little babies," and Benson and Hedges concludes, "Life just isn't that simple anymore." Hyperbole, or overstatement, is probably the most common figurative device used by advertisers. Chantilly perfume by Houbigant says, "... and sud- denly nothing is the same." Arpege by Lanvin is described as, "Very simply, the most beautiful fragrance in the world." Bonne Bell, makers of suntan lotion says, "You've just spent a wonderful day in the sun and you're killing your skin." Madge, the manicurist who soaks her clients' hands in Palmolive liquid, says, "Call the police! These hands are a crime!" Purple passage is simply a type of over- statement. It is a passage with a style that is too elaborate or ornate for the context. The following quote from a Ford Mustang II commercial seems a little too elaborate for the description of a mere car: "The body lines flow gracefully over a rich silver metallic finish. Note, too, the classic half vinyl roof, opera windows and the dramatic moon-roof op- tion - a one-way window to the world." Euphemism and disphemism also demonstrate an incompatibility of at least the connotative (and sometimes the denotative as well) fea- tures of expressions. Max Factor refers to "blemishes," not pimples; Hefty makes "trash," not garbage, bags. Mitchum talks about "prob- lem perspiration," not sweat. Roaman's fashion catalog doesn't talk about fat people, but rather those with "fuller figures." And Honor House, which sells girdles, has a product named "tummy trim." Disphemisms also occur in advertisements. There are French Anti- Wrinkle Petals which are advertised as "A New Wrinkle in Beauty Aids." Quaker Oats advertises themselves as the "Breakfast of losers." Twist lemon-menthol cigarettes says, "Our new menthol is a lemon." And Terminix Pest Control Company says, "When you think of pests think of us."</page><page sequence="10">152 Et cetera • SUMMER 1980 There are two literary devices used in advertisements that are based on the organization of the discourse: in medias res, and anticlimax - the first refers to the organization at the beginning of the discourse, the second to that at the end. In medias res is a device used by authors who want to get a fast start by starting in the middle. Kraft Cheese begins an ad with "Robust flavor," and then adds, "That's what the English like about their cheddar cheese." Anticlimax or bathos can be defined as a sudden decline from the dignified or significant to the trivial or banal. Casa de Goes is de- scribed as the $87,553.00 bottle of rum." Betty Crocker says, "The world will beat a path to your cookie jar." Oxford Pendaflex tells you, "You can improve the efficiency of your office for two hundred thousand dollars and twenty cents." There are a number of literary devices which are (or at least can be) complete discourses by themselves. Some of these are relatively short, like maxim, cliché, and epigram. Others are relatively long, like the parable or fable, homily, hubris, and panegyric. The United Negro College establishes a maxim - "A mind is a terrible thing to waste." Unlike the maxim, the cliché is especially trite and boring. That's why clichés usually have a second-level meaning in most advertisements. Wolfschmidt's says that, "Some people say all vodkas are alike. Wolf- schmidt's won 33 medals that say otherwise." This is answered by, "I'll drink to that!" The epigram is a short witty saying. Bayer Aspirin company says, "We go to a lot of pains," and a belt company says, "You deserve a good belt in the pants." As an example of a parable let us consider an ad for Volkswagen which reads, "I guess it was my male ego. I got rid of my '71 VW and bought a big, fancy, pretty car. It didn't take me long to wise up! It may have looked pretty but it was very impractical. So I went back to Volkswagen." The moral to the story was, "I'll never fall for a pretty face again." A basic difference between parables and fables is that fables often have animal characters. Diamonds Department Store in Phoenix has an ad picturing a rabbit and a turtle, with a moral being something to the effect that it's best to shop slowly at Diamonds. Homily is a discourse which is moralistic in tone. An example would be an ad for Blue Shield telling about drug abuse, and beginning with, "Too many kids find that the best time to smoke dope is when their parents are out getting drunk," and continues in this vein. The main difference between hubris or hybris and panegyric is that hubris is ex- cessive pride in oneself, while panegyric is excessive pride in someone else. Many ads are examples of hubris. The ad which begins with the question, "What sort of man reads Playboy," contains such exag- gerated pride that it almost comes off as satyric. He is, "One who commands the reins of every facet of his life. Alive. Aware. Active. He</page><page sequence="11">Literary Devices in Advertising 153 experiences life first hand, savoring each and every moment. No vi- carious living for him. He's a doer, not a sit-at-home spectator," and it continues with three more lines of such prose. Since this last example is written in the third-person rather than first person, it will suffice both as hubris and as panegyric. In concluding this article, let me consider some literary devices which are both phonological and semantic in their nature. The pun, otherwise known as paranomasia, is a play on two meanings of words which sound the same. Chrysler Corporation has an ad for the Simca picturing some attractive but stern nurses and the caption reading, "Look at Simca the way some pretty tough customers do." Onomato- poeia is another literary device that plays on the relationship between phonology and semantics. The American Cancer Society has an ad reading, "Raaaack, Hacckk, Ahhem, Cough," "I hear you're still smoking." And there is a shampoo named "Pssssssst." Lest I be accused of placing advertisements on a pedestal by saying that they use the same figurative devices as does great literature, let me end with two devices that will take advertisements from their pedestal - dithyramb, and doggerell. Dithyramb was a literary device charac- teristic of ancient Greek drama. It is now used to describe a wild emo- tional unrestrained song or poem. There are many advertisements which appear to follow this definition: one about Oscar Mayer Weiners, one about Burger King, one about Hershey Bars, another about Campbell's soup, still another about Whataburger, another about Chicken of the Sea tuna. There are dithyrambs about Coke, and about Pepsi, and about Budweiser, and about Tic Tac, and about Juicy Fruit gum, and many others. To illustrate the dithyramb in ad- vertising let me quote just one example: "Hold the pickle. Hold the lettuce. Special orders don't upset us. All we ask is that you let us, have it your way . . . . have it your way, have it your way . . . .have it your way .... At Burger King." In my opinion, the most significant difference between dithyramb and doggerel is that the former is to music, while the latter is not. There are many examples of doggerell in advertising. One doggerell poem reads, "The body is white . . . The fenders are blue . . . It's called the Free Spirit ... A bicycle built for you." In conclusion, literary devices do occur, and quite frequently, in advertisements. Literary devices also occur, however, as a common element in doggerell, which by definition is a bad and ineffective use of literary devices. The use of literary devices in advertising, there- fore, is no indication that advertisements are great literature. Whether advertisements should generally be classed as literary, as doggerell, or as something in between, is a question that will be left unanswered by this article.</page></plain_text>
