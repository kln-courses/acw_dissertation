Min Received: 3 September 2006 / Accepted: 3 September 2006 / Published online: 10 November 2006 ? Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006 Abstract In this essay I present the postmodern phenomenological approach of Levinas, Derrida, and Marion to the problem of naming the unnameable God. For Levinas, God is never experienced directly but only as a third person whose infinity is testified to in the infinity of responsibility to the hungry. For Derrida, God remains the unnameable "wholly other" accessible only as the indeterminate term of pure reference in prayer. For Marion, God remains the object of "de-nomination" through praise. In all three, the problem of naming the unnameable God is necessarily linked to how we relate to fellow human beings, to the hungry in Levinas, justice in Derrida, and charity in Marion. I also reflect on the merits and adequacy of phenomenology as such for speaking of divine transcendence. Keywords Derrida French postmodernism Levinas Marion Naming God Philosophy of religion Prayer Speaking of God has always been problematic. Assuming that the God one speaks of is truly God, not a projection or a mere concept of the human mind, the problem has been how to avoid sheer kataphasis and sheer apophasis, speaking of God in the same way we speak of our ordinary human experience and reducing God to an object among other objects in our empirical world, and never speaking of God at all because of the fear of such reduction and leaving God simply an unknowable X. The first is indeed dangerous. We invent God in our own images and abuse God in the many real and ideological battles we fight with other human groups. The second is no less dangerous, especially in the case of Christianity whose central message is that the transcendent, inaccessible God has come close to us in the humanity of Jesus. Sheer silence about God also means sheer irrelevance of God for human existence; it rules out not only our ideological abuse of God but also God's own initiative to A. K.

Is it possible, then, to speak of God in a way that both preserves God's irreducible transcendence and allows God's initiative to address us in the only language we know, the human language? In this essay I propose to examine the recent attempts to deal with this classical issue among three French postmodernist phenomenologists, Levinas, Derrida, and Marion.1 All three share the rejection of "metaphysics" as "ontotheology," but each also has his own unique approach. I propose to present their respective approaches in the first three sections, discuss their internal debates, especially between Derrida and Marion, in the fourth section, and provide a brief reflection on the merits and limits of a purely phenomenological approach to the problem of naming the unnameable God in the concluding section. Given the limitations of space I will have to be very brief and remain focused on the essentials. Levinas: finding the unnameable God in the hungry2 Levinas's approach to God begins with Heidegger's critique of traditional metaphys ics as onto-theo-logy. For Heidegger, ontotheology understands God in terms of being but, forgetting the ontological difference between being and beings, understands being itself in terms of beings, which leads it to understand God as the cause or ground of beings and therefore as a supreme being. Such a conception of being and God is ulti mately a product of the will to power, and leads to the crisis of science and technology and the "death of God." For Heidegger we must overcome metaphysics and learn to think being without beings or think being as such. For Levinas, however, the mistake of ontotheology is not in taking being for God but in taking God for being as though being were the ultimate source of meaning and intelligibility. Unlike Heidegger, Levinas regards being itself as a product of intentionality, consciousness, knowledge, representation, and disclosure, all of which presuppose the equality, proportion, correlation, and identity between subject and object, noesis and noema, thought and the world, and which therefore reduce the object to the unity and identity of the subject, to a presence in a consciousness and therefore in principle relative to the subject. To think is always to reduce to the syn thetic unity of the constitutive consciousness, transcendental or empirical. Likewise, all meaning is reduced to that of experience and the subjective conditions of the pos sibility of experience under which things must appear, manifest or show themselves. Ontotheology presupposes coincidence between thinking and being, situates even God in the processes of being in the world and conceives of God as simply the being par excellence, i.e., the "supreme" being, conceived and thematized on the model of entities in the world and reduced to a function of human subjectivity. What goes "beyond being" in its true transcendence has not been thinkable in the history of Western philosophy, which has been the history of the destruction of transcendence. Even in phenomenology including that of Husserl and Heidegger there has been no 1 For a general introduction to the treatment of the problem of God in Levinas, Derrida, and Marion, see Horner (2001). For a more critical, controversial introduction, see the essays by Philip Blond, Graham Ward, and Kevin Hart dealing with Levinas, Marion, and Derrida respectively in Blond (1998). 2 The best source for Levinas' attempt to overcome ontotheology is found in Emmanuel Levinas (2000, "God and Onto-Theo-Logy") and (1998, "The Idea of God"). I use the abbreviation, GDT, in the body of the text. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 101 true "shaking" of intentional, representational consciousness as a privileged mode of access to reality (GDT, pp. 211-212). The issue, then, is how to think God in a non-ontotheological way, without reference to being or beings, or beyond being altogether. Is another model of meaning and intelligibility possible? For Levinas, the way out of ontotheology is the way of ethics. Only in ethics do we encounter a reality which we cannot contain, thematize, rep resent, or in any case reduce to our own subjectivity and which is, therefore, truly transcendent, dis-proportionate and resistant to our own constitutive, domineering consciousness, capable of rupturing the immanence and identity of the subject and overturning its sovereignty and spontaneity. This reality is the reality of the Other [Autrui], whom I can encounter only in a relationship of the "face to face," a rela tionship beyond all theory, thematization, manifestation, disclosure, or vision. As neighbour the Other is near to me in such a way that it besieges and obsesses me, making me responsible for it and indeed rendering me irreplaceable and unique in that responsibility, questioning my self-identity without measure. Irreducible to a content of my knowledge, the Other remains a reality which is more than I can think or equal, deposing and decentering me instead. It is through this experience of the infinity and transcendence of the human Other that the "glory of the Infinite" rises (GDT, p. 162). For Levinas, it is especially the encounter of a particular kind of Other, the hungry, that shakes up our ordinary ontotheological consciousness in its complacency, clo sure, and arrogance, break the circle of immanence that imprisons us in mystification, deception, and ideology, and open a break or fissure in the "epic of being" in the direction of the beyond where an "other" mode of transcendence can appear (GDT, p. 169). As privation par excellence, as "the great frankness of matter," hunger is deaf to every reassuring ideology and every equilibrium. It is "a hunger that no music appeases, and that secularizes all that romantic eternity," a privation "despairing of this privation itself." It is "an appeal without reason or oration; neither aiming nor thematization... a preorational prayer, a demand as mendicancy, a question without a given, a question that is not even the posing of this very question, a question beyond, ... an oscillation between death and God." A question without response, it is "a question about God and to God" (GDT, p. 170). The glory of the Infinite cannot "appear" in itself. To appear means to become an object of representational consciousness, a presence to a constituting consciousness, and an item within a horizon or totality relative to a synthesizing consciousness. The only thing we can do, therefore, is to bear witness to the infinity of the Infinite in the only way that does not bring it back to being, that is, in the ethical relationship with the neighbor, the sole manner, for Levinas, in which an otherwise than being can signify. The only model of transcendence in the world is that of the Other. To think of God non-ontotheologically is to take the nearness of the neighbor and God together, which alone keeps God from reduction to immanence. The glory of the Infinite lies in the excess over the present, the impossibility of adequation, not in representation but in the form of responsibility for the neighbor. The Infinite is revealed in being witnessed to but without appearing, without showing itself as Infinite, only in the "surplus" in the exigency of responsibility for the Other. It is through this witnessing that the Infinite surpasses the finite and comes to pass. This is the "intrigue," not experience, of the Infinite in which I am involved without being able to merely contemplate and reduce it. In the responsibility it imposes this intrigue attaches us to the Infinite, which, however, also detaches itself from us in its infinity. Thus, the intrigue attaches us to 4? Springer</page><page sequence="4">102 Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 the absolute without relativizing it, without reducing it to an object of experience and thematization. Here God distances himself in the guise of a third person. Illeity refers to this way of detaching itself within the relationship of attachment. The true Infinite is revealed and accessible only as illeity, neither as a thou of unmediated dialogue nor as an object of thematization, but only as "a way of concerning me without entering into conjunction with me" (GDT, p. 285)3 or as "the non-phenomenality of the Other who affects me beyond representation, unbeknownst to me and like a thief" (GDT, p. 201). For Levinas, the disruption of the unity and synthesis of the / think is always the proper sign of true transcendence, and it is the unsurpassable contribution of Des cartes that his analysis of the idea of the infinite provides exactly such disruption and such sign of transcendence. The idea of God is a cogitatum of cogitado, but this formal, subjective reality breaks apart by the objective content of the infinite signified by the idea. The content explodes the structure of all representational, synthetic thought, breaks with all identities of being and thought, and relativizes the primordiality of intentionality. The idea of God is something placed in us and undergone by us, not something thought by us through the negation of the finite, and our waking or insom nia lies in this incomparable passivity, the intrigue of the infinite in us. The form of the cogito is interrupted by the content it cannot contain. Thus the idea of the Infinite signifies with a meaning prior to presence, an an-archy, signifying within the trace, neither exhausting itself in showing itself nor deriving its meaning from manifesta tion. Levinas construes this idea of the infinite in us as the deepest exigency of our existence (GDT, pp. 213-218). How is transcendence as a relation thinkable if it must exclude the copresence and contemporaneity of the two terms? Doesn't the desire for the infinite, then, restore the contemporaneity of the desirable and the desiring even though this desire is neither vision nor aiming? Is the transcendence of the desirable possible beyond interested ness and erotic love in which the / think reconstitutes presence? For Levinas, it is possi ble through the infinite placed in me, through the "more" that devastates and awakens the less. "Affected by the infinite, the / cannot go to an end it can equal. The approach increases the distance and enjoyment is only the increase of hunger. The desired one thus remains transcendent to desire. It is in this reversal of terms that transcendence, or the dis-inter-restedness of desire, comes to pass" (GDT, p. 222). The desirable, because infinite, remains separated even within desire, near yet different, "holy." This simultaneity of nearness and distance is possible, however, only if the desirable commands me to what is undesirable, only if he commands me to the undesirable par excellence, the other person. For Levinas, illeity denotes this way that the infinite has of referring, in the midst of its own desirability, to the nondesirable nearness. This involves extraordinary reversals: the goodness of the Good inspires the movement to itself only by setting it aside from the Good as desirable and turning it to the other. We can move to the Good only by going through the movement to the other. There is no unmediated, direct access to the Good. "The desirable separates itself from the relation to desire it called forth, and, through this separation or this holiness, the desirable remains a third person, a He at the base of the Thou. He does not fill me with good but compels me to goodness, better than the good to be received" (GDT, p. 223). For Levinas, it is only the concrete responsibility to the other that can transmute transcendental subjectivity into subjection to the other and effects "an 3 Ibid., p. 285. ?} Springer</page><page sequence="5">Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 103 opening of a self absolutely exposed and sobered from the ecstasy of intentionality" (GDT, p. 223), and it is, therefore, only through the mediation of this human other that our relation with the Infinite will be one of love without eros and maintain both distance and nearness. Without the human other, the Infinite other is reduced to an object of eros and nearness. It is this referral of the desirable to the nondesirable that tears God out of the objectivity of presence and out of being. He is no longer an object or an interlocutor in a dialogue. His distancing or transcendence turns into my responsibility. Thus understood, for Levinas, "God is not simply the first other but other than the other, other otherwise, other with an alterity prior to the alterity of the other person, prior to the ethical compulsion to the neighbor" (GDT, p. 224). Not an object, God is "transcendent to the point of absence, to the point of the confusion in which the substitution for the neighbor grows in nobility and in which the transcendence of the infinite is raised to its glory" (GDT, p. 224). Of this God who is "other otherwise," we cannot predicate ontotheological names. We can only refer to him as a "he" whose infinity can only be testified to in the infinity of the responsibility to the human other. Derrida: reference without a referent Derrida shares Levinas's rejection of ontotheology but approaches the question of naming the unnameable God by focusing more explicitly on the potential of negative theology as such. There are two phases in Derrida's relationship with the tradition of negative the ology. In his earlier works in the 60s and 70s he would reject negative theology as the culmination of the very ontotheology he would dismiss in the name of difference. This rejection, however, was not a simple rejection. He had been haunted by the promises of negative theology ever since, to which he has been returning in his more recent works since the 90s, retrieving and translating its deconstructionist potentialities, so much so that negative theology has now become as much a part of Derridean decon struction as have been such key notions as difference, khora, the trace, writing, the messianic, and justice. For the earlier Derrida, negative theology falls short in four ways. First, negative theology still remains within the predicative or judicative space of discourse in its strictly propositional form, privileging not only the indestructible unity of the word and but also the authority of the name, that is, within the horizon of the metaphysics of presence. Second, for all its criticisms of the shortcomings of human language, beyond all its negations, even beyond being, even beyond the alternatives of theism and atheism, negative theology still affirms some hyperessential reality, again becoming a metaphysics of presence in a more refined form. This "ontological wager of hy peressentiality" (DNT, p. 78)4 is operative in both Dionysius and Eckhart. Negative theology is not only negative but also, deep down, affirmative, in fact hyperaffirma tive. It only deconstructs the grammatical anthropomorphism of ordinary language and its phenomenal negativity, ultimately transmuting negation into the affirmation of a supreme being, however incommensurable it might be to the being of all that is. Third, as long as one speaks in the element of logic and ontotheological grammar, there is an irrepressible movement on the part of negative theology to ontotheolog ically reappropriate the hyperessential. For Derrida, this movement is irrepressible, 4 Coward and Foshay (1992). I use the abbreviation, DNT, in the body of the text. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="6">104 Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 but its ultimate failure is just as necessary. Fourth, and finally, the apophatic voyage often contains the promise, the possibility of an intuition of the hyperessential pres ence. It may be the vision of a dark light, but it still promises the immediacy of a presence, the possibility of union with God. The act of unknowing still claims to be a genuine "vision" and a genuine "knowledge." This movement towards the presence of vision and knowledge does not contain "the principle of its interruption" (DNT, p. 81). Even at this earlier stage, however, Derrida was haunted by the possibility that "perhaps there is within it [negative theology], hidden, restless, diverse, and itself heterogeneous, a voluminous and nebulous multiplicity of potentials to which the single expression 'negative theology' yet remains inadequate" (DNT, p. 82). The later stage of his relationship, then, consists in exploring these diverse potentials of neg ative theology, its many sides, manifest and hidden, positive and negative, and in short "deconstructing" negative theology precisely for the sake of its promise for deconstruction. For Derrida negative theology hides a certain boldness which is also self-contra dictory and ambiguous. Its boldness consists in "going further than is reasonably permitted. .. .passing to the limit, then crossing a frontier, including that of a com munity, thus of a sociopolitical, institutional, ecclesial reason or raison d'etre" (ON, p. 36)5. As the "voiceless voice" that speaks of God who (is) but beyond being, nega tive theology resembles a profession of atheism, but it is also an atheism that contains the most intense yearning for God. It sounds negative but hides a positive affirma tion. As theology it contains "the most insatiable desire of God," but as apophatic, it rejects all anthropotheomorphic forms of desire. To go toward the absolute other involves "the extreme tension of a desire that tries thereby to renounce its own proper momentum, its own movement of appropriation" (ON, p. 37). One may also ask what the desire of God means. Does the desire come from God in us, from God for us, or from us for God? Since no relation to self can be sure of preceding this desire, this relation to the other, all reflection on the self as well as on the idea or name of God is caught in the genealogy of this genitive. Likewise, if atheism testifies to the desire of God, in whose presence does it do this? Who speaks to whom? (ON, p. 37) For Derrida, we can ask the same question of the discourse of negative theology itself. To whom is this discourse addressed? Who is its addressee? As in Dionysius, negative theology exists only as a performative discourse, only as a prayer, an address, an apostrophe (to God), a confession, a testimony that involves "a singular movement of the soul," "a conversion of existence that accords itself to, in order to reveal in its very night, the most secret secret," a conversion toward the other in order to turn (it) toward God, an address to God already implying the possibility and necessity of the post-scriptum of fraternal love. Negative theology is not reducible to an act of cognitive reason, to informing, teaching, making known, revealing, or unveiling. It is a "stranger to knowing, thus to every determination or to every predicative attribution" (ON, pp. 38^10). As a language that also questions the very possibility of language, negative theology means (to say) very little, almost nothing, but also "perhaps something other than something," which accounts for its "inexhaustible" exhaustion. Where does this inex haustibility lie? As a logical discourse negative theology lends itself to formalization, which then can be mechanically repeated, falsified, and exposed to forgery and coun terfeit. This, however, is the very "vocation" of negative theology whose statement 5 Derrida (1995, p. 36). I use the abbreviation, ON, in the body of the text. ^ Springer</page><page sequence="7">Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 105 "empties itself by definition, of all intuitive plenitude." It is the very "kenosis of dis course" (ON, p. 50). As such, apophatic statements represent the moment of "crisis" in the Husserlian sense of the empty intuition. By the same token, by revealing the necessity of such a crisis and denouncing the pitfalls of intuitive consciousness and phenomenology, apophatic statements "destabilize" the self-evidence of phenomeno logical, ontological, and transcendental critiques. Emptiness is essential and necessary to them. Such statements guard against this emptiness through the moment of prayer or the hymn, but this protective moment remains "structurally exterior" to negative theology as such. The evaluation of the quality of negative theology as events depends on the relation that articulates this emptiness on the plenitude of a prayer or an attri bution (theo-logical or onto-logical) denegated. The criterion of negative theology lies in the measure of the relation stretched between emptiness and denegated positivity (ON, p. 51). Negative theology is possible only as an event and takes place in the course of prayer. For Derrida, it is toward this prayer of negative theology that all prayers ulti mately strain themselves. It "asks nothing, all the while asking more than everything. It asks God to give himself rather than gifts" (ON, p. 56). God is interpreted as gift or desire of giving, and prayer is this interpretation, the very "body" of this interpreta tion, the in and on where the event takes place, like the khora, body without body, the place of everything. This location "displaces and disorganizes all our onto-topological prejudices, in particular the objective science of space" (ON, p. 56). It is the "desert" found in us, not the space in which subjects and objects are found. The event of prayer takes place on the edge of the lips passed over by words that carry themselves toward God. These words of prayer "are carried [portes], both exported and deported, by a movement of ference (transference, reference, difference) toward God. They name God, speak of him, speak him, speak to him, let him speak in them, let themselves be carried by him, make (themselves) a reference to just what the name supposes to name beyond itself, the nameable beyond the name, the unnameable nameable" (ON, p. 58). The language of prayer, then, is opened by this ference yet also speaks the inad?qua tion of the reference, the insufficiency or the lapse of knowing. Such an inad?quation reveals the absence of a common measure between the opening, openness, revela tion or knowledge and a certain "absolute secret, nonprovisional, heterogeneous to all manifestation" (ON, p. 59). This secret is not the reserve of potential knowing, a potential manifestation. The language of abnegation is negative not only because it is not the language of descriptive predication and indicative proposition simply affected with a negation but also because it denounces as much as it renounces. It denounces, enjoining, prescribes overflowing this insufficiency, mandates doing the impossible, necessitates going there where one cannot go, "toward the name, toward the beyond of the name in the name" (ON, p. 59). Here then is the chance of a genuine decision, that always passes through "the madness of the undecidable and the impossible" (ON, p. 59), the decision to go where it is impossible to go. The language of negative theology thus contains a normative denunciation, "this sweet rage against language, this jealous anger of language within itself and against itself," a passion that leaves the mark of a scar or a wound in that place where the impossible takes place. The event takes place at the edge of language where there is nothing but reference, and it is in trie question whether the referent?everything save the name?is or is not indispensable that all history of negative theology plays itself out. Every authentic statement of negative theology must bear the trace of the wound, the stigmata of its ^ Springer</page><page sequence="8">106 Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 own proper inad?quation, of its own proper disproportion, of its hubris countersigned (ON, pp. 60-61). In the classical tradition apophasis has always represented a sort of paradoxical hyperbole. Hyperbole names the movement of transcendence that carries or trans ports beyond being or beingness epekeina tes ousias. This excessive movement, this hyperbole announces in the double sense of signaling an open possibility and pro voking the opening of the possibility. Its event, therefore, is at once revealing and producing. Its event announces what comes and makes come what will come in all the movements in hyper, ultra, au-dela, beyond, ueber, which will precipitate discourse or, first of all, existence. This precipitation is their passion. This hyperbolic movement pre cipitates not only beyond being or God insofar as he is the supreme being but "beyond God even as name, as naming, named, or nameable, insofar as reference is made there to some thing." This "beyond" is not a place but a movement of transcendence that surpasses God himself, being, essence, the proper or the self-same. The movement "radically dissociates being and knowing, existence and knowledge." It fractures the cogito as it cracks even the analogy between God and creatures. The "analogy does not repair, or reconcile, but aggravates the dissociation" (ON, pp. 63-67). In effect, then, for Derrida negative theology is more than a thesis or a claim within theology; it is a movement, a passion, a desire of transcendence beyond all being, essence, identity, or anything that can be called "some thing,' a movement of refer ence without a particular referent. As such, negative theology constitutes an essential part of deconstruction itself applicable to all areas of life. It embodies not only a sub versive critique of all claims to identity, unity, and presence but also the most intense yearning?behind such a critique?for a life freed from all enslaving ideologies and fulfilled beyond all expectation, a yearning and a hope for a life of truth and justice, for the "messianic" without a messiah. Negative theology "launches or carries nega tivity as the principle of auto-destruction in the heart of each thesis; in any event, this theology suspends every thesis, all belief, all doxa" (ON, p. 67). As "a movement of internal rebellion," it entails "the interruption of a sort of social contract, the one that gives right to the State, the nation, more generally to the philosophical community as rational and logocentric community" (ON, p. 67). Derrida goes so far as to say that "I trust no text that is not in some way contaminated with negative theology, and even among those texts that apparently do not have, want, or believe they have any relation with theology in general. Negative theology is everywhere, but it is never by itself. In that way it also belongs, without fulfilling, to the space of the philosophical or onto theological promise that it seems to break: to record... the referential transcendence of language: to say God such as he is, beyond his images, beyond this idol that being can still be, beyond what is said, seen, or known of him; to respond to the true name of God, to the name to which God responds and corresponds beyond the name that we know him by or hear. It is to this end that the negative procedure refuses, denies, rejects all the inadequate attributions. It does so in the name of a way of truth and in order to hear the name of a just voice" (ON, p. 69).6 In short, for Derrida, the naming of God, who cannot be named either positively or negatively at the level of predication, is possible only as negative theology in its self-transcending, self-negating movement as prayer to an other whose name remains forever unspecified, or as pure reference without a referent and only as a move 6 Ibid., p. 69.

Marion: naming the unnameable God through praise Marion also shares with Levinas and Derrida the critical dismissal of ontotheology and the language of predication based on ontotheology as inappropriate to the dis course on God. With both he agrees that the God of ontotheology is only an idol; the much touted "death of God" was in fact the "twilight of idols." Marion also agrees with them that we have to go beyond the language of predication and find a mode of reference to God that will preserve the true transcendence of God. It is also precisely here that Marion shows his differences from both. Levinas hardly refers to the tra dition of negative theology, while Derrida deconstructs and explores the tradition of negative theology for all its potential for the service of deconstruction and justice with emphasis on the self-transcending and self-negating dynamics of negative theology. Marion, on the other hand, explores the Dionysian tradition for the positive content of its negations and advocates not pure prayer but prayer precisely as praise, from the perspective of a Trinitarian theology of the gift. How, then, do we go about thinking the "unthinkable" God precisely in her "unthinkability," God as an "unknown" God who is "ab-solute" and released from any thinkable relation to anything other than itself and incomprehensible in terms of the concepts that measures and are measured by the world? What is a non-conceptual, non-representational approach to God? Here it is no longer a question of speaking a transcendent "object," even a "supreme" "personal" being, as long as it is still one among other objects and subject to the conditions of worldly objectivity, but identi fying the hermeneutic horizon itself for describing the simultaneous separation and intimacy, incommensurability and communion, withdrawal and closeness that char acterizes God's relation to the world, for which Marion uses the phenomenological term, "distance." Distance does not mean spatial distance or spatial absence, nor does it belong to the world of objects at all. It is not a concept or a signifier. It is the absolutely anterior and exterior horizon for the transcendental relation between God and the world of objects, a metalanguage that describes God's intimate alterity and constitutive asymmetry with which God is related to the world. How, then, do we identify and distinguish this distance and withdrawal of God from the mere absence of the gods? What is the true form of the unsayable of distance? How do we say the unsayable in its twofold character as a supreme nonbeing and as a hyperbolic separation? Distance is both "a censure and a condition" and requires one to "think the doubly unthinkable according to excess (supremacy over beings in general) and according to lack (withdrawal as insistence, without being)" (ID, p. 140)? How think distance without reducing it to an object or a supreme being, without an ontic treatment of God within a system of objective predication, and without even let ting the supreme being state a predication about itself by itself (reference to Barth?)? How is a discourse of distance on its own terms possible? How speak of God while maintaining precisely God's unthinkability as a condition of its own authenticity? (ID, pp. 45^6,140-141).8 7 Marion (2001, p. 140). I use the abbreviation, ID, in the body of the text. 8 Ibid., pp. 140-41; see also Marion (1991, pp. 45^16). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="10">108 Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 Here Marion, along with Levinas and Derrida, dismisses predicative language as language unacceptable to distance. Predicative language categorically attributes a predicate to a subject and crosses the distance between subject and predicate; the predicate exhausts the subject. Categorical, predicative language thus eliminates whatever distance or excess the object may have through appropriation. The claim to appropriate the subject through one's own predicative language and achieve ade quacy between subject and predicate is inherent in the very nature of all predicative language, which, therefore, is simply unacceptable as the language or discourse of dis tance. The impossibility of predicating anything of God or attaining God as a referent that would verify a proposition still harbors the regret that such predication would be desirable. For Marion, such a regret harbors idolatry, the reduction of God to an entity in the world. We must go beyond the predicative, propositional use of language altogether and find a qualitatively different use. Here Marion picks up on Dionysius's turn from the saying of predicative language to "praise" or from discourse to prayer. Praise is neither true nor false. Marion goes beyond the alternatives of either saying or keeping silence. Even if one cannot say, it does not follow that one must be silent. A discourse of praise remains an alternative to saying and silence. It conjoins the rigor of a precise language and the assurance that it maintains and travels through distance. It maintains distance because it praises the Requisite, the object of prayerful request, as anonymous and outside every name. Anonymity is not a question of a negative predication, less an inverted category than an inversion of the category, not the simple absence of names but the name of absence. Distance opens up, and the name of the absent gives itself to be believed. Names fail only to betray the distraction of possible meanings, and the abdication of meaning gives to be thought "the sense-less direction of an excessive signification" and "the excrescence of signification over possible statements and meanings" (ID, p. 185). The Requisite is anonymous not only because no name can remove that anonymity but more because anonymity itself becomes a name through excess. Anonymity does not make the signification it avoids disappear but designates it as strictly anonymous, which in turn introduces the play of the icon?of the invisible. The anonymous leaves us without a name, speechless, and in astonishment, ensuring the direction toward distance. Here (non-predicative) signification and (predicative) meaning grow in inverse proportion. The impoverishment of meaning alone acknowledges the depth of signi fication of anonymity as anonymity. By renouncing the category and its affirmation in favor of a "praise as ..." finally set off against any meaningful adequation of the pred icate to the subject, language highlights distance and the iconic depth of language emerges. Signification achieves unspeakably the pertinence that meaning acknowl edges not ensuring. It is this transfer of pertinence that properly announces distance. "The same distance that masks the excess of signification (anonymity) provokes the excess of meaning and the multiplication of names" (ID, p. 186). Because anonymous, one and the same meaning-lessness [in-sense] gives rise to an infinity of praises?thus distance, now ensured of its irreducibility, can be endlessly traversed. Anonymity and polyonymy go together. Marion presents praise as the appropriate language of distance by exploring its "as" structure. Typically, a human being, x, praises the Requisite, as y, e.g., good, beautiful, lord, etc. The "as" here does not mean either "as if" or a categorical predication that identifies the Requisite. It only indicates the "relation" under which x aims at the Requisite. Y here presupposes distance and refers back first to x. Each x or reques ^y Springer</page><page sequence="11">Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 109 tant aims at the Requisite under the relation in which the latter remains immanent in the former (interior intimo meo) without claiming to categorically predicate y of the Requisite. That is, the y aims at the Requisite, but describes the requestant x, although y relates itself to the Requisite in that it is this relation that constitutes the only stake of the statement. Praise corresponds to this nonpredicative reserve of "as." Praise describes the requestant, not the Requisite, while aiming at the Requisite. The "as" announces a relation of request between x and the Requisite under a certain relation y. A statement is made, but it is not a purely objective statement that may be true or false. It is made always within a metalanguage that implicates the speaker in the very determination of the statement. The "as" indicates that the request ("I praise you, Lord, as beauty") springs from the requestant in order to target or aim at a third point beyond the speaker and the statement, a point "infinitely" beyond the segment of the line that these two can determine. The self-implication does not presuppose any subjective reduction but "takes up the subjectivity of the speaker within the unsurpassable aim of the Requisite" (ID, p. 188). The speaker thus speaks in distance. Marion insists, however, that this discourse of praise is not simply identical with the performative use of language. There are two reasons for this. One is that the performative presupposes a minimal qualification of the speaker as the author of the performative statement. Only lovers can say "I love you," only the police officer "I arrest you." But who will ensure a qualification of every requestant according to the infinity of names that support praise? It is also clear that the performance of the request depends on more than the requestant, who cannot make the request except in that which commands and precedes it, in the anterior distance, the Requisite. In short, the authorization of performance must come from the Requisite as such, who summons the requestant to make the request insofar as it exceeds all predication and performance of all statements. In the case of the performance of praise, the performer receives his qualification, previously, not from himself but from that at which his state ment aims without predicating anything of it. As an anterior gift, it is distance that qualifies the requestant. This investment by distance disqualifies both the subjectivist reduction of the language of praise and its assimilation to a simple performative. The second reason for distinguishing between the discourse of praise and simple performative use of language is that the performative treats language as a practice, as an act, without saying or stating anything. It marries, sells, loves, arrests, etc., and terminates outside of a statement. When words make things, they do not state any meaning; they speak not in order to say anything but in order to act. The discourse of praise, on the other hand, maintains the propositional statement, although referred to the act of praising. If the statement disappeared in the performance, the aim would relate no name to the Requisite. Praise does not attempt to resolve the statement into a fact. Praise indeed functions as a performative, but as a performative that elabo rates gifts with words, not make things with words. Praise performs all the more, the more radically it sets the statement outside of the one stating. Instead of reabsorb ing the statement within the performance by the speaker, praise absorbs the speaker in the performance of the gift through the statement. Praise is ecstatic in this sense. Discourse of praise, then, plays beyond any performative, the three terms, the proposi tional statement, the requestant, and the Requisite, remain irreducible to one another. The discourse of praise, then, is possible only because there are other legitimate uses of language in addition to the verification of truth and falsity. As for Wittgen stein, so for Marion propositions can function without any of their significations being ^ Springer</page><page sequence="12">110 Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 attested by empirical or quasi-empirical verifications. The language of praise utilizes unverifiable significations but delivers an intelligible meaning through the intention and the "forms of life." The usage of praise is not founded in the empirical verifi cation of the Requisite but in the quasi-liturgical form of life that establishes it in distance, for a request, in the manner of a requestant. Truth value is not the only source of the validity of propositions. Praise is neither true nor false, nor even contra dictory. It answers to other uses each of which has irreducibly its own language game (ID, pp. 189-195). Derrida and Marion: pure address or praise? What about "pure prayer" vs. "praise"? Does the invocation of the unnameable God require "pure prayer" in the sense of a pure address to an indeterminate addressee as Derrida insists, or "praise" in the sense of a prayer addressed to God determinate enough to command praise as Marion does? Why the struggle between indeterminacy and determinacy of the addressee? For the deconstructionist Derrida always concerned over the danger of the tyr anny of the same and ideological manipulation, it is a matter of crucial importance to make sure that apophasis does not say "just anything" in its passage to excellence or eminence, and to prevent apophasis from "manipulating" its negations. It is the expe rience of prayer that provides this insurance and prevention. Here the role of prayer is not introductory or secondary but essential. Prayer "adjusts discursive asceticism, the passage through the desert of discourse, the apparent referential vacuity which will only avoid empty deliria and prattling, by addressing itself from the start to the other, to you. But to you as 'hyperessential and more than divine Trinity'" (DNT, p. 110). There are, however, two traits that Derrida finds it necessary to distinguish in the experience of prayer. One trait is that it is an address to the other as other, even God. Prayer at least means the act of addressing oneself to the other as other, asking, supplicating, searching out, no matter what. The "pure" prayer "demands only that the other hear it, receive it, be present to it, be the other as such, a gift, call, and even cause of prayer" (DNT, p. 110). This purity of invocation ("no matter what") is characteristic of prayer as a discourse that is not predicative, theoretical, or constative. It is a pure "speaking to," not a "speaking of," a pure "apostrophe" without further determination. The other trait of prayer is that of praise or encomium. In Dionysius, Hans Urs von Balthasar, and Marion these two traits are inseparable. For Derrida, they are neither identical nor inseparable. To be sure, neither pure prayer nor praise is a mode of constative predication; both are performative. For Derrida, however, pure prayer or prayer "in itself" "implies nothing other than the supplicating address to the other, perhaps beyond all supplication and giving, to give the promise of His presence as other, and finally the transcendence of His otherness itself, even without any other determination." On the other hand, praise, although not a simple attributive or predicative speech, "nevertheless preserves an irreducible relationship to the attribution." For Derrida, praise "qualifies God and determines prayer, determines the other, Him to whom it addresses itself, refers, invoking Him even as the source of prayer." No longer "the pure address of the prayer to the other, praise contains a "movement of determination" which determines God as "Trinitar ian" and "hyperessential" and thus distinguishes the Christian from all other kinds of ^ Springer</page><page sequence="13">Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 111 prayer (DNY, p. 110). To reject this distinction between pure prayer and praise, for Derrida, is to reject the essential quality of prayer to every non-Christian prayer. For Derrida, this Christian attempt to express the real transcendence of God by means of a movement of determination results, as Marion insists, in the multiplication of voices and discourses, but this is precisely where the danger lies. In the multiplication of predicates, however carefully chosen and qualified, "a predicate can always conceal another predicate," and "the voice of an utterance can conceal another," introducing into the discourse "the subtlety, but also the conflicts, the relations of power, even the aporias of a politics of doctrine: I want to say: a politics of initiation or teaching in general, and of an institutional politics of interpretation" (DNT, p. 113).9 Derrida, then, is opposed to praise because it introduces determining predicates which then can be abused as justification of the persecution of the other, the whole point of deconstruction. Marion is right in interpreting Derrida as deconstructing praise as "a disguised form of predication" (IN, p. 23).10 Marion's response to Derrida is twofold. First, by elaborating an interpretation of Dionysius already given in his early work, The Idol and Distance, Marion classifies three ways of referring to something, "affirmation," "negation," and "beyond every affirmation and negation." Affirmations and negations are simply contraries of each other and at the same level, the level of truth and falsity. The third way is played out simply beyond the field of truth and falsity, no longer interested in affirming anything, not even in the guise of negation, as Derrida accuses negative theology of doing. Dionysius is quite explicit about this. It is no longer a question of naming God nor a question of not naming God but simply of "de-nominating him?in the twofold sense that this term can have: to name (to name in view of..., to nominate), but with some thing close to a negation, and consequently also to undo him from all nomination" (IN, p. 27). This is a purely pragmatic function of language, that of referring to some thing without the predicative intention of either affirming or denying something about something. For Dionysius, the name of aitia or cause has this denominating function. For Marion, Dionysius' mystical theology, misnamed "negative" theology, cannot be accused of introducing affirmation in the guise of negation; it simply transcends both affirmation and negation. For Marion, this third way is a "saturated" phenomenon. Every phenomenon is defined by the inescapable duality of appearing to and what appears and therefore also signification and fulfillment, intention and intuition, and noesis and noema. There are three possibilities we can envision of the relationships between the terms. When the intention finds itself confirmed by the intuition, this equality defines adequation and therefore the evidence of truth, the way of kataphasis. On the other hand, the intention can exceed all intuitive fulfillment, in which case the phenomenon is inca pable of delivering objective knowledge on account of a lack, the way of apophasis. These two ways operate within the horizon of predication. There is a third possibility: the intention, concept, or signification can never reach adequation with the intuition or fulfillment, not because intuition is lacking but because that intuition exceeds what the concept can receive, expose, and comprehend. The object here remains incom prehensible in the strict sense not because of any deficiency in the giving intuition as in the second case but because of "its surplus which neither concept, signification, 9 Ibid., 113. 10 Marion (1999a). For this essay, I use the abbreviation, IN, in the body of the text. On Derrida's fear of anything "determinate," see Min (2004, pp. 31-34, 38^40). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="14">112 Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 nor intention can foresee, organize, or contain." "The excess of intuition overcomes, submerges, exceeds, in short saturates, the measure of each and every concept. What is given disqualifies every concept." It is the excess, not deficiency, which here undoes knowledge and predication altogether. For Marion, then, "God remains incompre hensible, not imperceptible?without adequate concept, not without giving intuition." The proliferation of names may suggest that the concepts are still there, but it also calls attention to the insufficiency of the very concepts it puts in play and "constantly sub verts" them (IN, p. 40). The multiplication of concepts does not, as Derrida seems to fear, convert praise into a disguised form of predication. Denomination goes beyond all predication and nomination. For Marion, the Name "is not said, it calls," in the most terrifying of all calls (IN, p. 42). Is the excess of the giving intuition plausible in the case of God, who, it seems, can never be given intuitively? Here, Marion sides with Levinas that it is the very requirement proper to the phenomenality of God to contradict the conditions for the possibility of experiencing objects by way of paradox, the paradox of being given while contradicting the conditions of such givenness. Furthermore, the excess of intuition can be accomplished in the form of stupor and terror imposed by the incomprehen sibility due to excess and testifying to that excess. Likewise, for Marion, the very fact of our obsession with God by way of invocation, discussion, and even denial when we all admit we have no concept of God, the fact that the question of God dwells within us so deeply in these and other ways, is an indication of the fascinating presence of an intuition of God whose concept we clearly lack (IN, p. 41). It is this excess of intuition, nourished through prayer, liturgy, and ecclesial life but without the appropriate words, concepts, and significations capable of adequately articulating it, that makes pluralism of theology inherent in the notion of revelation.11 Against Derrida's critique that praise is disguised predication?after all, praise applies titles to God, Marion raises two objections. One is that Derrida assumes that dedicating a name to someone as in praise necessarily implies identifying him with his essence and thus subjecting him to a metaphysics of presence. The fact, however, is that "proper" names are not really proper and that they never freeze individuals in their essences, and that their function is not the metaphysical one of defining and fixing an individual in presence but the factual, pragmatic one of referring to them. Assuming that praise attributes a name to God, it is not meant to name him properly or essentially but only to mark his absence, anonymity, and withdrawal?exactly as every name dissimulates every individual, whom it merely indicates without ever man ifesting. Marion's second objection to Derrida is that it is not possible to accomplish prayer pure and simple, without naming, at least in the sense of aiming at. Can one really pray without naming, however imperfectly, the identity of the person to whom one is praying? Is prayer possible without invoking the one to whom one prays? Is prayer possible without at least "de-nominating" the addressee? This third way, with out any predicative intention of either affirming or denying, has the sole pragmatic function of "aiming in the direction of_, of relating to ..., of comporting oneself towards..., of reckoning with...?in short of dealing with..." (IN, p. 30). Prayer defin itively transgresses the predicative, nominative, and therefore metaphysical sense of language. Derrida's response to Marion's critique is that Derrida's treatment of negative theology in Sauf le nom, presented earlier in this essay, already agrees with Marion 11 Marion (1999b, p. 69). ^ Springer</page><page sequence="15">Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 113 on the third way of de-nomination beyond position and negation as the appropriate way and on the performative, pragmatic, liturgical function of theological language. Derrida insists, however, that there are still outstanding issues with Marion on the question of prayer and praise. In his penetrating commentary on the exchange between Marion and Derrida, Cap uto points out that for Marion praise implies "pure reference and no meaning," while for Derrida, praise cannot be a matter of pure reference and no meaning because we do not praise just anything but only something that is praiseworthy in a "significant" if not predicative way. This question, however, may be just as applicable to Derrida's own notion of the "messianic" understood as free from apophantic determinability. Ultimately, for Caputo, and I think he is right here, the difference between Marion and Derrida on naming the unnameable God is a political difference. Derrida's main concern in the discourse on the name of God is prophetic justice, and is "more con cerned with the ethico-politics of hospitality than with mystical or negative theology." This means that for Marion, the name of God is enacted in "praise and liturgy," while for Derrida, it is enacted in "peace and justice."12 Concluding reflections All three thinkers under review agree that the God of ontotheology is an idol to be rejected, that there is no way of direct, predicative reference to God, and that we have to go beyond the language of predication to some mode of testimony and invocation. For Levinas, the naming of the unnameable God is not a matter of a direct invocation of a divine Thou but a matter of bearing witness to the infinite alterity of God through the mediation of care for the hungry and poor human others of this world. Without this mediation our relation to the unnameable God remains inauthentic. Derrida also links the authenticity of our relation to the unnameable God to acts of historical tran scendence toward a fullness of truth and justice. Marion does not specifically refer to any particular socio-political relevance of our relation to the unnameable God, not because he is indifferent to politics but because he sees all life as involved in the Trin itarian and christologically mediated process of giving and loving (ID, pp. 162-180). In all three, how we speak of God is inseparable from how we treat our fellow human beings. The question of naming the unnameable God is not only a theological but also a political question. This is an important point. Given the massive historical abuse of the name of God for ideological purposes and the colossal human suffering in its wake, it is under standable and plausible that Levinas and Derrida insist on justice to the suffering other as condition of the authenticity of our praxis of divine names. While justice and liturgy are not mutually reducible, it is also critical to recognize that the liturgical address to God, without the discipline of the praxis of justice, can lapse into senti mental aestheticism without historical efficacy, mere transcendence without historical challenge, while the practice of justice, without prayer, may be deprived of the essen tial support of its most compelling symbol of transcendence. Prayer needs the test of its authenticity through justice, and justice in its self-transcending ideality (Derrida) 12 For John D. Caputo's perceptive comparison of Marion and Derrida, see his essay in Caputo (1999). The quotations are from p. 200. ?} Springer</page><page sequence="16">114 Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 needs transcendent justification through prayer. In this sense, Levinas, Derrida, and Marion are mutually complementary. The preceding discussions, especially the debate over pure prayer vs. praise, also remind us of the critical importance of maintaining tension between the positive and the negative in our language about God. Not speaking about God at all may prevent us from falling into the idolatry of reducing God to a projection of human ideologies and interests, but it also spells the end of all (theistic) religion and theology. What we need to do is to maintain a tension between the positive and the negative in our necessary reference to the unnameable God. This is especially important in the case of Christianity, which believes in a God who is both incomprehensible in her absolute transcendence and accessible to humanity in her incarnation. More than any other religion, Christianity has to speak of God because God has spoken to us in the Son in the language of humanity, but also has to speak of God in such a way that it does not reduce God to another object in the world even if it is the highest or most exalted object. The danger of reducing God to another familiar object of our worldly expe rience is a constant reality and threat in so much of theology and church life, often exploding into public life in the form of fundamentalism. In this sense, the concen trated critique of the God of ontotheology by the three thinkers is well taken and must be taken seriously even by those who may not go all the way with them. It is their special merit to remind us that God is always greater than our concept of God, that we are always tempted to abuse our concept as a weapon against others, and that we can speak of God as God only when we speak with an irreducible sense of dissatisfaction, insufficiency, and uncertainty.13 The preceding discussion also raises a question about the merits and adequacy of phenomenology as phenomenology in dealing with the question of divine transcen dence. On the one hand, I count it as a merit of phenomenology to try to provide a lived experiential content for divine transcendence and bring that transcendence closer to our experience precisely in its transcendence. Levinas speaks of the infinity of the infinite other as well as of the infinity of the human other that interrupts and devastates the arrogance and sovereignty of constitutive consciousness and subjectiv ity. Derrida speaks of the "emptiness" of intuition, the "desertification of language," and the "kenosis of discourse" in relation to the "wholly other," and Marion of the "excess" of intuition and the terror and torpor that overwhelms us in our experience of the incomprehensible God. These thinkers may emphasize different aspects of our experience of the divine, but all of them try to understand divine transcendence precisely in relation to human experience and human subjectivity. In that sense they contribute to the richness of the human experience of the unnameable God. It is plau sible to believe that those are authentic aspects of our human experience of divine transcendence. On the other hand, their common attack on ontotheology and insistence on phenomenology as the only way of preserving divine transcendence raise questions about the adequacy of phenomenology to account for divine transcendence by itself. However one may conceive phenomenology, and whether or not one holds to the concept of "horizon" and "conditions for the possibility of experience" as essential to phenomenology, it is essential to phenomenology to bring things into the realm of hu man experience, describe them in terms of its essential structures (e.g., noesis/noema, 13 See especially Kevin Hart, "Jacques Derrida: The God Effect," in Blond (1998, p. 278); also Min (2007). ?) Springer</page><page sequence="17">Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 115 intention/fulfillment), and in any event consider things only in relation to lived human experience and by the same token discount things as irrelevant insofar as they are out side of that experience. A tendency to humanize things and put human experience and human subjectivity at the center of reality is inherent in all phenomenology. Insofar as phenomenology claims to be the only access to reality, it is essentially homocentric. It does not help in this regard to say that all three authors seek to overcome precisely the absolutism of human subjectivity in their common critique of the will to power and ontotheology as its specific product. This only reinforces two further concerns. The first concern is that negation of human subjectivity as the only mark of authentic relation to the unnameable God still harbors a central preoccupation with the human subject and thus remains homocentric. Whether one insists on exalted human sub jectivity as in ontotheology or on ruptured and ove whelmed human subjectivity as in our three thinkers, it is still human subjectivity that operates as the criterion of the authenticity of our relation to God. Our three thinkers remain just as homocentric in their negation of human subjectivity as is ontotheology in its affirmation of human subjectivity. Don't we need emancipation from homocentrism altogether in order to truly release the real transcendence of God? As long as we continue to measure God's real otherness by how God transcends, negates, surprises, or even loves us, we still determine God within our narrow human horizon. If the service of human desires and ideologies does not manifest God's transcendence, the mere rejection and contradic tion of such desires and ideologies is not going to do so either. If God is more than our desires and ideologies, she is also more than their mere negation. The other concern is whether it does justice to divine transcendence to conceive it only in opposition and contradiction to human subjectivity, a question also raised in the context of Barth's insistence on the absolute sovereignty of God. This question has been answered by Hegel and Rahner among others who say that it is a sure way of compromising divine transcendence because it makes transcendence both relative to (the negation of ) human subjectivity and a finite being limited by another finite being. It also introduces a hostile dualism in the relation between God and human beings and subjects itself to all the criticisms such a dualism has evoked in modern thought.14 These concerns raise the much more fundamental issue about the adequacy of phe nomenology to account for divine transcendence by itself. The transcendence of God experienced in the infinite responsibility to a human other (Levinas), in the excess of intuition (Marion) or in its emptiness (Derrida) is simply not identical with divine transcendence in its full reality. Such lived experience only raises the further question, What is there about the reality of God such that human beings can experience her in those ways? We cannot claim that God is infinite and incomprehensible because we experience her that way. We only experience God that way because God is that way in her own right. The measure of God's transcendence must be sought on her own terms, on who she is, not merely on what she does or does not do to human beings. The horizon of the transcendent God transcends the horizon of humanity and indeed all created things. Lived human experience as such cannot be the adequate source of our knowledge of divine transcendence. Lived experience is itself a function of our existence in the 14 For a critique of Levinas as a latter-day Manichean for his extreme dualism of God and the world and his relentless emphasis on the contradiction between them, see Emmanuel Levinas: God and Phenomenology, in Bond (1998,195-228). %1 Springer</page><page sequence="18">116 Int J Philos Relig (2006) 60:99-116 cosmos where our existence is itself that of one among other existents, not the privi leged center of the universe. What we need, therefore, is a mode of knowing that goes beyond the phenomenological analysis of our lived experience and its essences and is capable of surveying the whole of the universe in its structure and dynamics so as to both recognize the proper place of humanity in the larger scheme of things and marvel at the transcendence of the creator who is larger than the universe, which is larger than human history, which is larger than our lived experience. It is a mode of knowing that is truly contemplative, interested in knowing the world for its own sake, not in exploit ing its mysteries and resources, truly receptive and unitive in seeking harmony and communion with reality which it has not created, not aggressive or confrontational, and truly self-transcendent in seeking to know all that can be known in its structure and dynamism. Such a mode of knowing has an ancient name, theoretical or contem plative intellect, used and appealed to by the likes of Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, and Aquinas. Perhaps it is high time that we had retrieved something of this contemplative intellect for our time for God's sake? The choice is not between phenomenology and ontotheology. The way of contemplative intellect remains a third option.15 References Blond, P. (Ed.). (1998). Post-secular philosophy: Between philosophy and theology. London: Routledge. Caputo, J. D. (1999).
