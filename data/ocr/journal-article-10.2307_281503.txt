CARIBBEAN BAHAMAS. Robert S. Carr (Archaeological and Historical Conservancy) is conducting archaeological surveys on Abaco, working with the Albert Lowe His- torical Museum on Green Turtle Cay and the Bahamas Archaeological Project. Research includes extensive interviews with informants and a review of materials collected during the last century. Carr's fieldwork in- cludes recording cave and midden sites, such as a small midden at Hole-in-the-Wall on the south end of Abaco, and the discovery of two small prehistoric campsites farther north, one at Treasure Cay characterized by a thin deposit of shell refuse and Palmetto Plain sherds. The latter were overlain by historic materials from the Loyalist Carleton settlement. The other site, found on little Abaco, contained shell refuse, Palmetto Plain ce- ramics, and a nonlocal lithic abrader. This site is lo- cated on a sand beach and has been eroded by wave and tide action. A particular emphasis in Carr's research is deter- mination of Lucayan-Florida interaction. Ethnograph- ic reports indicate that early in the sixteenth century Arawaks arrived on the south Florida coast and were allowed to settle by the cacique Senquene. Surveys have revealed one site on Key Largo with a single shell-and- limerock-tempered Palmetto Plain sherd, the only re- corded example outside the Bahamas. Other sites in the Florida keys have large quantities of Surfside In- cised lugged bowls suggestive of an Antillean influence. An effigy ceramic bottle, probably recovered from an Abaco cave, is in the Albert Lowe Museum collections at Green Turtle Cay. It is similar to effigy bottles of the Weeden Island period of Florida's Gulf coast. The bottle combines the form of a bird on top of a gourd, and its paste is similar to that of St. Johns vessels found throughout northern Florida. Excavations continued at the Long Bay site on San Salvador Island, where fifteenth-century Spanish ar- tifacts were found in direct association with prehistoric Lucayan pottery, firecracked rock, burnt shell, shell tools and beads, and fish bones. The site is located along the Bay at which some historians believe Chris- topher Columbus first landed in the New World on October 12, 1492. The 1988 excavations produced ad- ditional glass beads, pieces of sulfur, majolica, and glazed pottery, all presumably manufactured in Spain before the fifteenth century, and decorated Palmetto Ware pottery, a considerable quantity of tiny shell "heishi" beads, broken and burnt shell, and fish and small animal bones. A stone metate and mano were found, perhaps the first to be excavated in the Baha- mas. Research was under the direction of Charles A. Hoffman (Northern Arizona University) with support from the Science Museums of Charlotte (North Car- olina) and the Bahamas Field Station (BFS). 166 February 15. May 15. August 15: November 1:</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT RESEARCH Also on San Salvador, the Three-Dog site was ex- cavated by Mary Jane Berman and Perry L. Gnivecki (Wake Forest University). Analyses of six flotation and three in situ charcoal samples from the midden and activity area revealed Lignum vitae, Conocarpus sp., Erythroxylon sp., Exostemea sp., and Croton sp. All are hard and dense woods. Two phytolith samples in- dicated weedy and herbaceous species, but no identi- fications could be made by Deborah Pearsall (Univer- sity of Missouri-Columbia). This research was carried out through the BFS on San Salvador. JAMAICA. Research by Douglas V. Armstrong (Syracuse University), Barry Higman and Kofi Eman- ual Agorsah (University of the West Indies, Mona) at the eighteenth-century slave settlement on Seville Sug- ar Plantation, St. Anns, identified 43 probable house- yard areas grouped in two temporally distinct loci. Sur- vey data confirm historical estate plans indicating a shift in village location and the spatial organization of houses between 1721 and 1795. Armstrong will ex- amine houses at each locus and address questions con- cerning African to Jamaican transformations. The project is supported by a grant from Syracuse Univer- sity and by the Jamaican National Trust Commission. PUERTO RICO. The Maisabel Archaeological Project, sponsored by the Centro de Investigaci6nes Indigenas de Puerto Rico (CIIPR), is in the fourth year of continuous full-time operation. Following a 13- month field season (July 1985-September 1986), the artifacts are being analyzed, tabulated, and cataloged. Based upon characteristics of the site structure and preliminary results of the artifact analysis, project di- rector Peter Siegel (CIIPR) offers inferences for socio- political organization in the Saladoid and Ostionoid periods. There are five rounded midden areas arranged in a circular configuration in the central portion of the site. Centered amongst and ringed by the mounds is a cemetery that appears to span the Saladoid and Os- tionoid occupations. Based on the careful positioning of the mounds in relation to the cemetery, as well as on the high density of elaborate artifacts found within the mounds, Siegel suggests that the mounds and cem- etery together comprised a ceremonial complex of sorts. The central location of the mounds and cemetery would provide a visual, spatial, social, and cosmological focal point for the occupants of the prehistoric settlement. This architectural complex may be a physical repre- sentative of the ancestor cult that is very important for many lowland South American Indian groups. Siegel further believes that the caretakers and organizers of this centralized sacred space would mediate between nature and supernature, as well as adjudicate disputes within the settlement. He argues that the Maisabel data provide evidence for the initial stages of political con- solidation in the early Ceramic age of the Caribbean, ultimately resulting in the complex chiefdoms known as "Classic Taino," observed by the Spaniards in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries. One of the problems in determining the occupational history of the Maisabel site is the palimpsest nature of some of the Saladoid and Ostionoid deposits. Further, it is not clear whether all of the burials from the cem- etery and a separate house area are contemporaneous with each other or derived from the different cultural complexes represented in the site. Few of the burials were interred with temporally diagnostic artifacts (Sa- ladoid series). Thus, Siegel will date, by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS), fragments of bone from the burials without grave goods. The University of Arizona AMS Laboratory, through a National Science Foun- dation (NSF) grant to Siegel, is analyzing fragments of bone from 18 burials. In addition, NSF is supporting a program of ther- moluminescence (TL) dating of selected ceramic arti- facts from Maisabel mound 1 (predominantly Hacien- da Grande style artifacts), Mound 2 (primarily Cuevas style artifacts), and the house area (mainly Monserrate and Santa Elena styles of artifacts). The dating of pot- tery from each of these complexes will assist in cor- relating the relative chronology to the calendrical scale. The first 89 cm of mound 1 yielded the expected assortment of Hacienda Grande artifacts: well-execut- ed white and red painted pottery, nicely polished stone celts and adzes, shell amulets, etc. From 80 to 100 cm very little cultural material was recovered and it seemed that the unit would bottom out shortly thereafter. From 100 to 130 cm, however, a fair amount of pottery decorated with zoned-incised crosshatching (ZIC) was recovered. This situation presents a good opportunity to test the current debate in Saladoid archaeology re- garding the temporal placement of the controversial cultural "complex" known as La Hueca. Siegel's opin- ion is that the ZIC ware is simply part of the Hacienda Grande complex, as opposed to a distinct style (La Hueca), or distinct subseries (Huecan Saladoid), or dis- tinct tradition (Huecoid). The TL dating project has been expanded to include specimens from the lower ZIC deposit with the upper, painted-ware deposit. This work is being done in collaboration with Ian Bailiff of the TL Dating Laboratory, University of Durham, En- gland. In addition to examining site-structural and settle- ment-pattern aspects at Maisabel, characteristics of the overall adaptive pattern are being addressed. Susan deFrance (University of Florida [UF]) completed an analysis of the faunal remains. Contrary to the con- ventional wisdom held by many Caribbean archaeol- ogists, deFrance finds that the early Saladoid colonists were not exploiting primarily the terrestrial resources. In addition to land crabs (Gecarcinus and Cardisoma) and hutia (Isolobodon portoricensis), the Saladoid de- posits yielded a wide range of aquatic faunal remains, indicating that marine, estuarine, and riverine habi- tants were exploited. DeFrance suggests that models of Saladoid subsistence adaptation presented in the past largely are a product of sampling bias. Without fine-mesh screening many of the aquatic species simply are lost, producing an image of heavy reliance on ter- restrial organisms. However, at Maisabel soil samples from every recovery context were screened and used for flotation. Therefore, the data are more reliable for subsistence reconstructions than those generally used in the past. Macrobotanical analysis of archaeological features from Maisabel is the responsibility of Lee Ann New- som (UF). Although the flotation samples have been 167</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY unproductive in terms of plant subsistence remains, and generally lacking in charcoal, the carbon samples represent dense accumulations of charcoal collected with the surrounding matrix and bagged in their en- tirety. Laboratory procedures were devised to mini- mize breakage of the charcoal in conjunction with flo- tation of the matrix for evidence of seeds and other plant remains, but no direct evidence of subsistence remains has emerged. From the charcoal Newsom identified six wood types: Bully-tree (Pouteria sp.), Thespesia, guava (Psidium), Cassine, Sterculea, and an unidentified hardwood. William Keegan (Florida State Museum) is con- ducting a stable-isotope analysis of human skeletons from Maisabel; nitrogen and carbon isotopes are being examined to learn the relative degree of reliance on marine vs. terrestrial animals and maize versus other plants. As part of her continuing osteological analysis of the Maisabel skeletons, Linda Budinoff (Kent State Uni- versity) has begun facial reconstructions of Arawak skulls. Skull anatomy confirms observations by Chris- topher Columbus that both males and females had very broad faces and foreheads, and large eyes. Alveolar prognathism and large anterior teeth suggest full lips, while rugged markings on the zygomatic arch hint at large masseter muscles. NEVIS. Samual M. Wilson (University of Chicago) as located 22 sites, of which two are preceramic; one has been dated to 540 ? 60 B.C. (Beta-19328). Two sites are Saladoid. Of eighteen sites ofElenan Ostionoid tradition, one has been '4C dated at A.D. 670 ? 60 (Beta-19327). Wilson tested three of these sites. Set- tlement from all periods is concentrated on the wind- ward southeast coast of the island. The research was undertaken in collaboration with the Hamilton Mu- seum and the Nevis Historical and Conservation So- ciety, with their support and that of the Organization of American States. ANTIGUA. Bruce K. Nodine (Brown University), continues his research on the use of shellfish by aceram- ic peoples in the Lesser Antilles. On Antigua, he is working with 45 aceramic sites, almost 10 times more than recorded on any other Lesser Antillean island. A date of about 320 B.C. at an aceramic site on Nonsuch Bay is compared with a date of about 1775 B.C. from the Jolly Beach aceramic site that Dave Davis (Uni- versity of Southern Maine) recorded. Shellfish remains from the two sites are similar, yet the high densities of lithic debitage and fish bone at Jolly beach are absent at Nonsuch. Nodine also excavated the Twenty Hill site, one of two that are more than 1 km inland and at elevations of more than 30 m. The remains more closely resemble those found at Nonsuch rather than those from Jolly Beach. Nodine suggests that the prime reasons for the high incidence of aceramic sites on Antigua are (1) Antigua's better-than-average reef re- sources as compared to "high" islands and (2) the abundance of chert, while other islands have little. MONTSERRAT. Analysis of skeletons and arti- facts recovered at the Harney site is complete. Robert W. Mann, Lee Meadows, and William Bass (University of Tennessee) identified 17 individuals from the cem- etery. Analysis of artifacts and burial patterns by David R. Watters (Carnegie Museum of Natural History) in- dicates the individuals most likely were slaves buried in the late eighteenth century. ST. MARTIN. Jay B. Haviser (Archeologisch-An- thropologisch Instituut Nederlandse Antillen) reports a Saladoid site on the Hope Estate. A single test pit has produced zoned-incised crosshatch sherds, white- on-red sherds, and several examples of inverted-bell- shape rim profiles. The faunal assemblage chiefly is land crabs (Cardisoma sp.), dog, and bird bone. The primary shellfish is Cittarium pica. The '4C dates, from charcoal samples, are approximately 325 and 290 B.C. These would constitute some of the oldest Saladoid dates for the Antilles. TRINIDAD. Arie Boomert resigned his position at the University of the West Indies (Trinidad) in early 1988 to rejoin his family in Holland, much to our professional regret. Peter Harris is holding on for him on a one-day-per-week basis. Harris also regrets to report that some 80 percent of the important Archaic site of Banwari (6500-4000 B.C.) was destroyed through illegal bulldozing by the owner. This has been stopped and fortunately enough remains for a multidisciplinary excavation at some future date. The freshly cut face of the remaining portion showed seven stratigraphic layers, as opposed to the three re- ported in the 1970 excavation. Layer thicknesses vary from 20 to 30 cm. A large chipped-stone, stemmed, trianguloid point, of local brown chert, was found on a low ridge along a major freshwater swamp, near Biche in eastern Trin- idad. Although it resembles other finds dating after 6000 B.C., Harris estimates a 9000-8000 B.C. date, just before rising sea level separated Trinidad from the mainland, a situation compatible with a forest or swamp-edge-feeding megafauna. Other large-stemmed trianguloid points are known from Guyana; possibly this type of point was made earlier in eastern northern South America than previously thought. Harris also reports a chipped, ovoid, unifacial scrap- er/knife in the early Ceramic site of Atagual (ca. A.D. 0-250). The site is shallow and disturbed, but the abun- dant material is exclusively early Saladoid with strong Barrancoid influence. It has several features: an inland hilltop location, strong Barrancoid influence at this ear- ly date, and unique items (stone nose ornament, fos- silized shark's tooth, knife, small magnetite pestle (?), pieces of imported, unmarked greenstone, perhaps for celts). Overall it seems likely that this style scraper/ knife was part of the early Ceramic repertoire. Two large, Spanish, faceted chevron beads were found in the late Ceramic site of Mamoral, in central Trini- dad. Size (30 x 25-27 mm) and colors (blue/white/ red/white/green/white) suggest a date prior to 1550. The associated Amerindian pottery has the micaceous sand temper characteristic of the St. Joseph's complex, an assemblage local to northern Trinidad, and prob- ably, therefore, Mainland Carib or just possibly Ne- puyo. Beads may represent purchase of provisions or 168 [Vol. 55, No. 1, 1990]</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT RESEARCH slaves during Spanish west-coast slave raiding, but, interestingly, the site is 22 km inland. One small (13 mm) red bead with longitudinal white stripes was found in the late Ceramic site of Esmeralda in southern Trin- idad. The bead is made from a hard stone such as jasper, and the white stripes are narrow incisions filled with molten white material, possibly powdered glass. The associated Amerindian pottery has the cariape temper associated with the Mayoid series, an assem- blage restricted to southeastern and southern Trinidad before Columbus, and then to the mission villages of the "Naparima" Indians (A.D. 1687-1849). A fragment of a European clay-pipe stem was found in the Amerindian site of Speyside on the extreme east coast of Tobago. The bore diameter of 6/4 inch suggests a date of A.D. 1680-1710, while associated Amerin- dian pottery seems to be a degenerate form of the Caliv- iny/Suazoid complex. For most of this period Tobago was a no-man's-land, occupied or visited by local Amerindians, French-speaking Caribs, privateers, French turtlers, and Barbadian woodcutters. During the eighteenth century the eastern end of Tobago was visited often by French-speaking Island Caribs and pri- vateers, seeking wild meat and other provisions, who may have been responsible for this pipe stem. Steps are being taken to preserve in perpetuity the Amerindian mission village of Saraneta (A.D. 1688- 1789). After the Indians were relocated, the site was abandoned. Unlike other mission villages it was never built over, but has been plowed twice for sugarcane in the last 11 years. Surface collections suggest to Harris a central plaza, with Amerindian artifacts all around it, including a rectangular "snuff-grinder." A small number of European artifacts in the northeast corer include a large "upholstery" tack with gold-leaf surface. There seems to be considerable potential here for add- ing to our meager information on the historic Amer- indians. Charles A. Hoffman and Thomas F. Lynch THE AMAZON, EASTERN BRAZIL, AND THE ORINOCO BRAZIL. Amapd Territory. In September, 1988, Klaus Hilbert (Museu Paraense Emilio Goeldi [MPEG]) began a study of the preceramic occupation of the Am- azon Basin. Initial research financed by the Museu Goeldi was carried out in the Igarape do Lago, a trib- utary of the Rio Maraca. A 4- x -l-m trench was ex- cavated in the Buracao do Laranjal rockshelter to test for a preceramic occupation. The shelter is formed by a ledge of polished sandstone between 2 and 6 m high that extends for about 200 m. The ledge is partly col- lapsed, so that only a few small niches remain. Farrier Penny, who founded the Museu Goeldi in 1872, dis- covered anthropomorphic funeral urns of the Maraca phase in some of the niches. Klaus Hilbert found a number of lithic artifacts and a hearth with charcoal under 50 cm of fluvial sand and on top of a layer of fragments and blocks of sandstone, which had fallen from the roof of the rockshelter. The artifacts are made of local raw material such as compact sandstone and quartz. Cores are flaked with a bipolar technique, similar to artifacts from the Serra do Carajas site of Para. No biface tools have been found in this site. Excavations were carried out to a depth of 120 cm where water was encountered; no other occupation lay- ers were found. Washed-out red geometrical designs were painted on the walls of some of the rockshelters. One niche contained an anthropomorphic pictograph. The geometric paintings could belong to the Maraca phase that lasted more or less to the time of European contact, while the anthropomorphic figure might be- long to the preceramic occupation of Buracao do La- ranjal. A 14C date of 3750 ? 110 B.P. (Beta-30746) recently has been obtained for the site. More systematic excavations are planned for this site and other rock- shelters known in the area. Ilha do Cunahy, Gruta das Caretas, and Possinho rockshelters are to be excavated in late 1989. Future work at the sites of Monte Alegre and Serra do Carajas will extend the project into the state of Para. Pard. In June and July 1988, Klaus Hilbert took up the Porto Trombetas archaeological salvage project that was initiated by the late Mario F. Sim6es (MPEG). The project is to continue for a period of five years under a cooperative agreement between the Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento e Technol6gico (CNPq), MPEG, and the Mineragao Rio do Morte Mining Com- pany. The objective is to carry out salvage work in the terras pretas (black earth sites) disturbed by activities related to the mining of bauxite in the Serra do Saraca. The first stage of work involved the systematic survey of an immense area along the Rio Trombetas extending as much as 30 km inland. During the survey, 40 terras pretas sites were identified (25 situated on the Batata, do Moura, and Acari lakes on the right bank of the Rio Trombetas, eight sites about 6 km inland along small tributaries of the Trombetas, and seven sites more than 30 km from the Trombetas in the Serra do Saraca. All the sites, even those located in the Serra do Saraca, are near rivers. On six of the terras pretas sites, no archaeological evidence could be found. Sites with an absence of archaeological finds were characterized by large amounts of burnt soil and charcoal that may have resulted from slash-and-burn agriculture. Alternative- ly, these sites may have had a ceremonial function. Polished and flaked lithic material and Konduri style ceramics were found on the habitation sites. Konduri is believed to be contemporary to the Santarem culture. The pottery is cauixi (sponge-spicule) tempered and is characterized by punctate incised decoration, biomor- phic and anthropomorphic applique, and tripods. From the area of the Rio Trombetas, Rio Nhamunda, and Lago Sapucua more than 100 sites with Konduri pot- tery are known. The depth of cultural refuge in habi- tation sites, where only Konduri pottery could be found, rarely exceeded 30 cm. Five sites along the Lago Batata, Lago do Moura, and the Rio Trombetas contained evidence of a second ceramic component tentatively called the Boa Vista phase as well as Konduri pottery. Two carbon samples, collected in 1975 by Peter Paul Hilbert from the deepest stratigraphic cuts of the Boa Vista site (Rio Trombetas), gave uncorrected '4C dates of 3280 ? 45 B.P. (Hannover Lab. Nr-7452) and 2950 169</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ? 130 B.P. (Hannover Lab. Nr-7453). Further inves- tigations are planned for the Boa Vista site in 1989. Dirse Clara Kern (University of Rio Grande do Sul) carried out pedological studies of archaeological terras pretas (ABE) in the region of Orixmina to verify the influence of human settlements in their formation. Kern was advised by Nestor Kampf (University of Rio Grande do Sul) of the school of Agronomy. Two sites, one with Anthropogenic Humic Latosolic Cambisol and the other with Anthropogenic Humic Pethroplin- thosol, were tested. Soil profiles from inside the sites were compared with ones from outside. The analysis showed that Ca, Mg, C, P, Zn, and Mn occurred in higher concentrations in the ABE soils. These elements also show vertical and horizontal discontinuities in the archaeological sites, decreasing to the extremities and with soil depth. ABE layers that appeared to be ho- mogeneous or difficult to separate visually, showed morphological divisions in various horizons. The ele- ments Ca, Mg, Zn, Mn, and C can be used in archae- ological research as an additional aid to find boundaries and to identify areas of human occupation. Morpho- logical analysis of profiles can be an important addition to stratigraphic descriptions. Bahia. Carlos Etchevarne (Museu de Arqueologia e Etnologia da Universidade Federal da Bahia [UFB]) reports that the museum's staff-Verbena Galvao, Lei- la Almeida, Carlos Etchevarne, Marco Martins, Mar- cos Messeder, Janai Macedo, Pedro Agostinho, and Rosario G. de Carvalho-has continued analyzing ma- terials excavated in the Itaparica archaeological salvage project. Between 1985 and 1988 work was carried out in the areas affected by construction of the Itaparica hydroelectric complex on the middle and lower Rio Sao Francisco. The area studied is circumscribed by caatinga so that the Sao Francisco stands out as the principal source of subsistence. Along the river's course four ecological zones inhabitable by pre-Colonial man have been identified. These zones are dunes, pans, vdr- zeas, and hill flanks where caves are found. The dif- ferent ecological zones are useful units of analysis. Flaked-stone tools were found in all sites studied, including those of ceramic-using peoples. The majority of flaked tools were of quartzite and quartz. Two kinds have been identified. The first consists of finely re- touched flakes and cores well made into scrapers and other small tools. The second includes large flakes and cores for axes, planes, and other large instruments that show no retouch. The ceramic occupation has elements that corre- spond closely to the Tupi-Guarani tradition. These include tools made by direct percussion, with or with- out retouch, primary burials without urns, lip plugs of amazonite, and ceramic pipes. It was possible to obtain a 14C date of 3840 ? 180 B.P. at the Paraiso site located in the Surubabel Dunes. Considering that ceramic materials were found on the surface of the Paraiso site, it is probable that the site has more than one component. Rockshelter sites located on the flank of the moun- tains contain pictographs. Geometric painting occurs at the sites of Pedra do Letreiro, Serra do Maroto, and Ponta da Serra. Three engraved geometric styles of art are found at other sites: (1) Bededouro das Pedras site has schematically engraved figures; (2) Pedra da Moeda has ovoids and circles of the vulva type; and (3) Ita- coatiara I has parallel and rectilinear incised designs with ovoid designs superimposed. The areas adjacent to the rivers and the vdrzeas were the areas preferred by colonizing populations through various periods of expansion. River sites are complex and have the great- est time depths, as exemplified by Itacoatiara I, dated to 2290 + 170 B.P. and 420 ? 160 B.P., and Guga, a vdrzea site, with dates of 3250 ? 180 B.P., 2900 ? 170 B.P., and a level of Colonial occupation. Dates were obtained from UFB with the aid of Antonio Ex- pedito G. de Azevedo and Luis R. P. A. Lima. Mato Grosso. The ethnoarchaeological and ar- chaeological project in the Sao Lourenco River basin continued through 1988-1989. Irmhild Wiist (Uni- versidade Federal do Goias) received financial support from Fundagao de Amparo Pesquisa do Estado de Sao Paulo (FAPES) and other support from CNPq. New 14C dates confirm that the area between the Vermelho, a tributary of the Sao Lourenco, and the Gracas, a tributary of the Araguaia, was occupied before Colonial times. Research results were presented at the Inter- national Congress of Americanists, Amsterdam. Most ancient are open-air sites near rivers. Refuse indicates relatively permanent settlements occupied by hunter-gatherers of the Itaparica tradition who made tools of chalcedony in the hard-percussion technique. Tools include plano-convex scrapers with much sec- ondary work around the edges and a great variety of small flakes with less retouch used to scrape, cut, pol- ish, and perforate. A second stone-working industry is found in the deepest beds of rockshelter sites. The final stage of this second tradition is dated at Tapera cave to 2970 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-27424), indicating a cultural continuity of less than 500 years. This second industry is character- ized by chalcedony flakes without secondary chipping. Food remains consist of fish and small-animal bones. These caves appear not be habitation sites, but no other sites could be associated with them. There is a sharp break between the Itaparica tradi- tion and the subsequent one dated at the site of Tom- bador to 2570 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-27428). The six sites of this second tradition are open-air encampments in areas transitional between the open woodlands (ce- rrado) and denser forest (mata) or within a strip of forest. They are located frequently on large outcrops of sandstone as much as 400 m in extent. Preference for such locations assured the reoccupation of the same site over a long period of time, and the depth of ar- chaeological deposits reaches a maximum of 25 cm. Tools made from flakes of quartzite predominate. Heavy unifacial tools with secondary work on the uti- lized edges frequently are ground on the opposite edges. Distinct scraping and digging instruments, occasionally with secondary bifacial work, as well as polishers and the first blades of axes, appear at this time. A sporadic presence of ceramic fragments on the surface of sites appears to indicate contacts with the carriers of the Uru tradition and of another tradition still not iden- tified. During this period, sites with occupations of short duration exclusively are located in areas of open forest and on tops of elevated mounds with ample 170 [Vol. 55, No. 1, 1990]</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT RESEARCH vistas. The elevated areas could indicate a growing territorial competition between local groups during the seasonal exploitation of the cerrado. Large circular villages with one to three concentric rings of habitations mark the appearance of the Uru tradition about 1000 B.P. The Uru tradition continues until the occupation of the area by the carriers of the bororo tradition, dated by the Arigao Bororo site (tra- ditionally, the first town in the Vermelho River area) to 230 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-27427). Tupiguarani ceramics are found in the most ancient towns of the Uru tra- dition. Low-relief figurative designs in rockshelter sites (with associated potsherds) also relate to the Uru tra- dition. Large flat plates dated at Pobore Raireu to 700 + 70 B.P. (Beta-27426) may indicate the introduction of bitter manioc. A defensive site (Morro das Araras) dat- ed to 590 ? 60 B.P. (Beta-27432) suggests ethnic ten- sions in the area, and the introduction of red slipped pottery with simple contours indicates new subtradi- tions in the area. During the 1988 survey of the middle course of the Sao Lourenco in the Municipality of Juscimeira, 18 new sites were located (13 rockshelter sites with mono- chrome and polychrome painting, two lithic work- shops, and 3 open-air ceramic sites of the Uru tradi- tion). The rock art represents a local variation of the Planalto style with influence from the Northeast Bra- zilian tradition. There are also two miniature geometric scenes illustrating everyday life. Rio de Janeiro. Ondemar F. Dias Junior (Instituto de Arqueologia Brasileira [IAB]) reports that the staff of the museum has been analyzing materials excavated in previous years by the Programa Nacional de Pes- quisas Arqueol6gicas and the Programa Nacional de Pesquisas Arqueol6gicas na Bacia Amaz6nia. Both projects were jointly supported by the Conselho Na- cional de Pesquisas and the Smithsonian Institution. Special efforts have been directed to the materials ex- cavated in 1985 through 1986 on the Juru and Soli- m6es. Six new ceramic phases are recognized in the middle Jurua River in the region of Itamarati. Another six phases have been defined for the Moa River area of Acre. Material excavated still earlier in the cave sites Ze Preto, Boqueirao Soberbo, and Barreirinho (Minas Gerais) also is undergoing analysis. Publication has been high on the list of priorities set by the Instituto de Arqueol6gia (IAB), with Volume I of Arqueo-IAB published and Catalog 3 in final preparation. Jandira (site RJ-JC-79) in the town of Marica is linked to the Itaipu "B" phase of maritime fishermen and collectors, tentatively dated to 1800 B.P. Nearby, other similar but smaller sites (RJ-JC-80 through RJ- JC-86) demonstrate a pattern of dispersed settlement. Archaeological salvage also was carried out for the Secretaria do Patrim6nio Hist6rico e Artistico Na- cional (SPHAN) on the Caju site (RJ-MP-8) in the city of Campos. There, ceramics of the Mucuri phase of the Una tradition are dated to 1430 ? 65 B.P. (SI- 705). Partially destroyed by construction since 1969, new work revealed an area with secondary and primary burials in urns or in holes lined with ceramic sherds. SPHAN and the prefectura of Campos hope to excavate the remaining one-fifth of the site next year. SPHAN also will analyze material collected at Morro Grande, Araruama (RJ-JC-78). Ceramics probably pertain to the Sernambitiba phase of the Tupiguarani tradition. Finally, the IAB began legal proceedings against the owner of the Malhada site (RJ-JC-15) in Cabo Frio, which dates to the Itaipu "A" phase. A large part of the post supports were preserved in situ, most having been destroyed when the site was turned into a cattle pasture by the owner. This is the only site in Brazil that has revealed such complex and extensive habi- tation structures. PERU. Ronald Weber (Field Museum of Natural History), Jose Roaque, and Jos6 Rodriguez (both from San Francisco de Yarinacocha) surveyed a portion of the central Ucayali from Pucallpa to Contamana. A site on high ground is located 1 hour by canoe from Nuevo Loretto according to Leguia Arvales, a resident health worker. It could not be reached easily during the dry season and, therefore, was not visited in 1988. Silvia M6nica Panaifo Teixeira (Universidad Cat6lica) reported a site located 8 hours by canoe from Paoyan. The site of Samaria on the Quebrada Quenquesh has at least two components. Weber collected a number of fragments of classic Cumancaya material and was told that copper axes had been found previously. Material collected by Panaifo Teixeira was not typically Cu- mancaya, as was that found by Weber, and the cultural and chronological relations of this second component need to be defined and identified. A second site located a one-half-hour walk from the village of Canaan de Cachiaco was not visited because the arroyo separating the site from the village was in flood stage. Heavily washed sherds collected by Alicia Sanchez Santos from the arroyo were quite varied in form and temper. Some of the sherds seemed to be tempered with shell, while others were tempered with sherds. Roaque related a myth about an ancient "Inca" that lived down river from Contamana, near Nueva Co- londria at Suaya. It is said that ceramic vessels, houses, and a great bell are at the site. Some informants said one could see houses and pottery under the water, but also it was mentioned that people (water spirits) could be seen in the houses. The Suaya site should be in- vestigated archaeologically. Work planned at Imariacocha in 1990 would involve shovel scraping a large area of a Caimito site to reveal data on settlement patterns and other cultural aspects of the Caimito occupation (300 to 500 B.P.). Panaifo Teixeira surveyed on the upper Ucayali and in the Pachitea area and is preparing a publication on the petroglyphs of the Pachitea. She also has carried out archaeological salvage work on the lower Ucayali at San Salvador. VENEZUELA. Work in the Federal Territory of Amazonas, begun in 1985, is being completed by Al- berta Zucchi (Instituto Venezolano de Investigaci6nes Cientificas). The project is financed by the Instituto. Research is designed to study the differences between human occupations of white- and black-water rivers. He located 37 sites (five on the Atabapo River, 16 on the Alto Orinoco, four on the Guainia, four on the 171</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY upper Negro, two on the Casiquiare, and six on the Canio San Miguel). Some are known only from surface collections; however, the majority have been tested archaeologically and one has been excavated exten- sively. In 1990 Zucchi will study another three sites, all oriented towards riverine resources. The sites lo- cated along the Orinoco are larger and more complex than those along the black-water rivers. At this time 18 14C dates (Beta-18451-18459, -25387-25389 and -25390-25396) indicate that the Alto Orinoco and Ata- bapo were occupied between 2060 ? 130 B.P. and 690 + 190 B.P., while the sites on the Negro, Guainia, and San Miguel rivers embrace a period between 1800 + 80 B.P. and 320 ? 50 B.P. Ceramic material pertains to at least four different related complexes. Archaeo- logical data, combined with linguistic, ethnographic, and environmental information, led Zucchi to (1) set up a new model to explain expansion in the northeast Amazon and northern South America of a population whose language pertains to a northern Maipurin Ara- wack family and (2) establish a new "Parallel Lines" ceramic horizon for the tropical lowlands to the north of the Amazon. Materials from five areas pertain to this new horizon (Central Amazon, Alto Negro-Ca- queta, Alto Orinoco-Atabapo-Vichada, Guyana, and the western Antilles). The temporal range is between 2950 B.P. and 350 B.P. Ronald L. Weber ANDEAN SOUTH AMERICA It is probably fair to say that the trends reported here previously have intensified over the succeeding 12 months. The economic problems in Andean South America continued to undermine locally funded ar- chaeological investigation in Peru and Ecuador, while the political upheavals in Peru increasingly restrict the regions in which studies can be conducted safely. With nearly half of Peru's population currently living in emergency zones, many project leaders have chosen to cancel or postpone archaeological fieldwork. The pre- mature suspension of the Upper Mantaro Archaeolog- ical Research Project is one unfortunate example of this phenomenon. On a more positive note, research continues to be initiated on the Peruvian coast, par- ticularly in the far north, and numerous programs of archaeological survey and excavation are flourishing in Ecuador and Bolivia. Despite the difficult times, the inauguration of the archaeological wing of the new Mu- seo de la Naci6n in Lima was scheduled for July of 1989. Also noteworthy is the organization of "Quito, antes de Benalcazar," a major exhibit on the prehistory of Quito, under the direction of Ivan Cruz Cevallos. Scholars working in the Andean region mourned the loss of Oscar Lostanau who died on February 24, 1989, at the age of 66. Although not a professional archae- ologist, Lostanau was an acknowledged authority on the archaeology of Jequetepeque and neighboring val- leys of the Peruvian north coast. He played an impor- tant role in defending the ruins of this area against destruction and he also provided critical assistance to national and foreign archaeological projects for half a century. H. Ubbehlohde-Doering, R. Kosok, R. Schae- del, H. Disselhoff, S. Izumi, U. Hecker, J. Zevallos, R. Keatinge, C. Donnan, and many other scholars bene- fited from his aid. Oscar Lostanau will long be remem- bered for his generosity and unflagging dedication to the study and preservation of Peru's prehispanic her- itage. ECUADOR. An intensive surface survey of a 120 km2 unit in the northeast sector of the Hoya del Guay- llabamba, in the northern Ecuadorian highlands, was completed recently by Tamara Bray (State University of New York [SUNY]-Binghamton). The project area comprises the southern sector of the Pais Caranqui, one of the last regions to be conquered by the Inca, and contains within it the towns of Guayllabamba and the important Inca mitmaq center of El Quinche. Bray surveyed the region during 1986 and 1987 using pedestrian transects spaced at 30-m intervals. A total of 111 archaeological sites were recorded and system- atically collected. The strategy resulted in a regional sample of approximately 40,000 potsherds and 14 kg of lithic materials. Obsidian detritus is particularly common. The area surveyed contains two site types with visible structural features. These are the tolas or mound sites, of which four were identified, and the pucaras or forts, of which six were identified. The dis- tinctive tola sites are considered to be diagnostic of Caranqui culture or influence, but there is still consid- erable debate as to whether the pucaras were con- structed by the Incas or by the local population. Three basic pottery types have been identified within the project area. All are chronologically late and rough- ly date between 1200 and 1530 A.D. The pottery styles include the Local wares, which constitute the vast ma- jority of the pottery recovered; the Inca materials, which are relatively few in number; and the Panzaleo wares, distinctive ceramics found in small quantities at ap- proximately one-third of the sites surveyed. Local material refers to the sturdy, coarse, and typ- ically plain wares identical to those reported from mound sites to the north in the province of Imbabura. These simply decorated wares constituted part of a broad technological tradition that characterized the re- gion of Caranqui culture. The Panzaleo material generally is thought to be a trade ware. It is distributed widely within the region, but rarely constitutes more than 5 percent of any given site assemblage. The vessel forms found within the Panzaleo complex include a large, globular-bodied olla and the compotera (pedestal) form. The pottery itself is recognizable by its extremely thin walls, orange paste, and thickened rim. Though very little Inca material was recovered, each of the pucaras was found to con- tain at least a few pieces of Inca polychrome. Inca pottery was also found at the site of El Quinche. In- terestingly, the Panzaleo ceramics rarely are found in association with Inca materials, suggesting that these two cultural components may be mutually exclusive of one another. In 1988, James A. Zeidler (University of Pittsburgh) and Deborah M. Pearsall (University of Missouri-Co- lumbia) initiated a joint archaeological/ethnobotanical study of Prehispanic chiefdoms in the Jama River drainage in northern Manabi Province, coastal Ecua- 172 [Vol. 55, No. 1, 1990]</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT RESEARCH dor. The first season of archaeological research was aimed at refining regional cultural chronology prior to a future valley-wide survey. Previous stratigraphic ex- cavations by Zeidler at the large regional center of San Isidro (M3D2-001) in the middle Jama Valley revealed a 3,000-year sequence beginning in Terminal Valdivia (Phase 8) times, followed by successive occupations of the Chorrera, Jama-Coaque I, and Jama-Coaque II cul- tures. Three separate layers of volcanic ash (tephra) also were identified at different points in the sequence, the first of which occurs within the Terminal Valdivia component dated by four radiocarbon assays between 3500 and 3630 B.P. (ISGS-1220-1223). More recent archaeological testing and systematic coring at San Isidro has corroborated this stratigraphic sequence, while testing at known sites in the lower reaches of the Jama Valley and adjacent coastal strip has allowed regional-level ceramic comparisons for the Jama-Coaque II occupation. The stratigraphic place- ment of two tephra layers located at various lower valley sites allows tentative correlation with the upper two tephra deposits from San Isidro. Limited testing in the upper levels of La Mina and El Tape, two sites in an alluvial terrace of the lower valley, revealed ar- chaeological deposits of the Integration period Jama- Coaque II culture. The site of La Mina (M3B3-001) yielded three dates, in correct stratigraphic order: 305 ? 35 B.P. (PITT-414); 515 ? 40 B.P. (PITT-415); and 1120 ? 30 B.P. (PITT-417). A single radiocarbon sam- ple from El Tape (M3B3-002) produced a date of 1260 ? 30 B.P. (PITT-410). Since samples come from these deposits overlying the uppermost tephra layer in the lower valley, the '4C date of 1260 B.P. places an upper limit on the timing of that volcanic event. Samples of volcanic ash deposits from various Jama Valley lo- cations and the adjacent coastal strip are currently undergoing tephrochronological analysis by J. Isaacson (Gordon McKay Laboratory, Harvard University) for purposes of internal correlation, as well as interregional correlation with known volcanic eruptions in the An- dean cordillera. In collaboration with James A. Zeidler, Deborah M. Pearsall has been investigating the nature of change in agricultural systems in the prehispanic Jama Valley. Research has focused on analysis of flotation and phy- tolith samples from San Isidro and collection of maize and manioc yield and cropping data for modeling ag- ricultural productivity. Maize phytoliths and charred remains of gourd and Canavalia bean have been iden- tified in Terminal Valdivia contexts at San Isidro. Charred maize kernels and cupules have been re- covered from Chorrera, Jama-Coaque I, and Jama- Coaque II contexts. Other analyses of biological ma- terials include archaeofaunal research by P. Stahl (SUNY-Binghamton) and palynological analysis by L. Zimmerman (Texas A&amp;M University). A textile adorned with gold-plated copper plaques was among the materials recovered by Leon Doyon (Yale University [YU]) from the Regional Develop- mental period shaft tombs at La Florida near Quito. Analysis of this garment by Suzette Doyon-Bernard (University of West Florida) revealed that it was woven of llama wool utilizing a twill weave similar to that employed by the prehispanic cultures of the northern coast of Peru. The identification of camelid fiber tex- tiles in the Ecuadorian highlands long before the Inca conquest accords well with George Miller's (California State University, Hayward) recent analysis of the fau- nal remains from the Regional Developmental period occupation at Pirincay, reported here last year. In May 1987, Jozef Buys (Cooperaci6n Tecnica al Desarollo del Gobierno Belgica) and Victoria Domin- guez (Instituto Nacional de Patrimonio Cultural del Ecuador) concluded excavations at Jardin del Este, a site located 5 km east of Quito in the Tumbaco Valley. A total of 450 m2 was excavated as part of a rescue- archaeology program initiated in response to the ur- banization of the zone. The investigations documented 20 tombs, 15 midden concentrations, a canal, and oth- er features. A radiocarbon sample from one area of refuse yielded a measurement of 2080 ? 65 B.P. (IRPA- 812). Most of the interments were in shallow (less than 60 cm depth) irregular or oval pits; grave goods in- cluded red-painted jars, tripod plates, copper ear- spools, and copper rings. Dominique Gomis de Idrovo (Museo del Banco Central [MBC], Cuenca) excavated at the site of Chau- llabamba in the lower Tomebamba Valley. He en- countered a number of flexed burials, as well as abun- dant ceramic evidence of exchange with the Ecuadorian coast and, perhaps, with northern Peru. The site had a single period of occupation. It is roughly contem- porary to Huancarcucho, excavated by Wendell Ben- nett in 1943, and the final part of the early component at Pirincay. MBC investigations at the Late Formative site of Pirincay, Province of Azuay, continued in 1988 under the direction of Karen Olsen Bruhns, San Francisco State University. Excavations continued in the site cen- ter where a 12- x -6-m area was opened to investigate the compacted volcanic-ash pavement discovered in 1987. The pavement covered most of the leveled por- tion of the hill and a stone-lined drainage system ran beneath it. Pits containing the residues of ceremonial activities from the level of an overlying midden cut into the pavement. The contents included painted cups, large jars, and camelid bones, many of which still were articulated. One pit contained a thoroughly burned young camelid and three whole vessels. The southern half of the area under study was excavated to bedrock, exposing the remains of three superimposed structures. The oldest was a rectangular stone pavement laid just above bedrock. Later in the site's history, a building with a floor of volcanic ash was constructed on .5 m of loose rock and midden fill. Bruhns uncovered ad- ditional rock-crystal-bead workshops, bringing the to- tal to over 40 in the excavated portion of the site. Obsidian cores and chips from the early levels indicate trade with northern Ecuador, while the appearance of sea shells, iridescent painted pottery, and imported Chorrera vessels is a clear indication of the importance of coastal trade from the earliest occupation until the site was abandoned in the early centuries A.D. A Cha- vin-related sherd of possible Lambayeque or Piura or- igin was associated with the latest of these structures. Finally, Bruhns notes that Norman Hammond (Boston University) ceased his association with the Pirincay Project in 1987. 173</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY In 1988 the Proyecto Arqueol6gico Tahuin, a salvage program of the Museo Antropologico of the Banco Central del Ecuador, Guayaquil, under the direction of Patricia J. Netherly, shifted the focus of research to the lower Arenillas Valley, downstream from the Ta- huin Dam. The presence of two major periods of flo- rescence associated with the Arenillas (ca. 800-300 B.C.) and Jambeli (ca. 300 B.C.-A.D. 600) cultures is now well established in both the lower and middle valley. There is also evidence of a substantial Late Valdivia occupation with sites in the mangrove littoral, on both sides of the river, and from two locations in the middle valley behind the dam. Evidence for con- tinuous occupation between Valdivia and Machalilla comes from several sites in the lower and middle val- ley. The presence of stylistic influence from the Ec- uadorian highlands (Loja) is evident in the Regional Development and Integration ceramics of the Arenillas Valley. In addition to surveying the east side of the Arenillas River from San Agustin to Jum6n, John Staller (South- ern Methodist University [SMU]) opened an excava- tion at La Emerenciana, a partially destroyed site on the Santa Rosa River. He recovered late Valdiva and transitional Valdivia-Machililla materials in ceremon- ial and habitational contexts. Netherly also carried out preliminary studies at the Poza Santa Maria site, a 7.5 ha Jambeli town with four areas of elite midden. Ad- ditional sites from earlier and later periods with similar intrasite patterning have been mapped. Geographer Alfred H. Siemens (University of British Columbia) has concluded the first phase of research into the wet- lands of the lower Arenillas Valley, which includes oblique aerial photography as well as ground testing and observation. NORTHERN PERU. During 1988, the Alto Piura Project, directed by Peter Kaulicke (Pontificia Uni- versidad Cat6lica [PUC]) and Jean Guffroy (OR- STOM, Lima) carried out the second field season of archaeological investigations in the upper portions of the Piura drainage. Kaulicke focused his efforts on Loma Valverde, one of the larger mounds in the region. Over 10 m in height and 66 m in length, this completely artificial construction was built by the Early Interme- diate period (EIP) Vicis culture using a technique of intentionally filled small chambers. The 1-3-m-high walls of the Vicus monumental architecture utilize a construction technique still employed on the far north coast of Peru. Wooden posts, probably of algarrobo, were set vertically at approximately 40 cm intervals and bound together by frameworks of cane and braided cordage both in front and in back of the logs. Clay mortar was pressed into this composite wall, leaving finger and cloth impressions in the mud. The platform summit supported standing structures of the Vicus cul- ture, most of which have been destroyed by a super- imposed Chimu-Inca zocalo and platform. Most of the ceramics recovered from the floors on the summit, like the pottery from the platform fill, consists of Vicfs- style material with the predominant vessel forms being jars with tall everted necks and bowls with rounded bases and everted lips. Straight and/or undulating bands and semicircles painted in fugitive white pigment are the most common mode of decoration on this pottery. Fragments with resist painting and Moche-related dec- oration exist in much smaller quantities. An earlier occupation ofLoma Valverde was isolated 2 m beneath the outer wall of the Vicfis platform. These deep ex- cavations documented a floor fragment covered by a thick layer of ash associated with non-Vicuis pottery, possibly dating to the final epochs of the Early Horizon (EH). Eighty meters south of the Loma Valverde platform is a low mound which once supported domestic build- ings of logs and, perhaps, wattle and daub. Judging from the associated pottery, its east-west orientation, and the construction techniques utilized, this mound was contemporary with the monumental Vicis plat- form complex at Loma Valverde. A large quantity of animal bones was recovered in this residential area and from Vic6s contexts at the nearby areas of public ar- chitecture. The faunal remains are quite varied and include large mammals (both deer and camelids), me- dium and small mammals, and birds. Abundant fish remains and lesser amounts of marine shell demon- strate the strong economic links between this upper valley area and the Pacific littoral. As part of the same project, Kryzystof Makowski (PUC) carried out excavations at Pampa de Juarez, a 20 ha site at the foot of Loma Valverde. This settlement is one of a series of superficially similar sites that extend along the hills on the shore of the Piura River. Small scale excavations in 1987 had revealed a small "fur- nace" utilized in the production of copper objects. This feature was associated with Vicis style pottery and an associated carbon sample yielded a measurement of 210 ? 65 B.C. The more extensive 1988 excavations covered 200 m2 and sampled four sectors of the site. These investigations confirmed that the main occu- pation was during the EIP and the Late Intermediate Period (LIP). No domestic architecture was discovered at Pampa de Juarez, but a thick layer of garbage was located next to an adobe wall fragment in a heavily eroded section of the site. It is possible that this sector could have been the habitation area. The excavations unearthed numerous subterranean features dug directly into unconsolidated sand. There were clay-lined, bot- tle-shaped chambers with depths up to 51 cm. The walls had been reddened from fire and a layer of carbon suggests the chamber's use as some kind of oven or hearth. Other features encountered include rectangular and oval pits up to 1.5 m across, filled with ash, and round, shallow pits with traces of burning. The specific function of these features has not been established, but the absence of cultural stratification suggests that most probably were used only briefly and perhaps represent different episodes of activity. It is clear from the pottery that Pampa de Juarez is contemporary with the two adjacent EIP cemeteries of Huaca Carbonell and Huaca Las Animas. The third focus of the Alto Piura Project was Cerro Macanche (Batanes), where excavations were carried out by Isaac Perez (Instituto Nacional de Cultura [INC]). This site is a modified natural promontory that has been heavily damaged to extract gravel and stone for modern construction. The ceramics recovered include Formative, Vicis, Middle Sicfn, Late Sican, and Chi- 174 [Vol. 55, No. 1, 1990]</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT RESEARCH mu-Inca styles. The Formative pottery is concentrated on the south slope along with a great quantity of flaking debris and numerous ax preforms. These materials seem to indicate the existence of a lithic-production area, perhaps dating to the Initial period (IP) or EH. Exca- vations on the summit of Cerro Macanche revealed alternating layers of tamped floors and gravel, as well as Late Sican and Chimu-Inca walls made of small rectangular adobes. Lisa Wells (National Center for Atmospheric Re- search) and Jay Noller (University of Colorado, Boul- der [UCB]) continued their investigation of the climate, landscape, and geoarchaeological history of the north coast. At Bayovar in Piura they studied marine terraces and overlying alluvial sediments that include shell middens. These deposits put constraints on the dating of the early Holocene progradation and will shed light on the early Holocene environment and the way in which local populations made use of the marine re- sources. Tom DeVries (University of South Carolina, Columbia) currently is studying the molluscs from the Bayovar terraces. Wells and Noller also studied de- posits of 10 large Holocene floods which are preserved in the overbank stratigraphy of the Lambayeque and La Leche valleys. The six oldest events apparently pre- date the development of ceramics in these valleys and the four youngest date to the age of ceramics. Since these plains did not flood during 1982-1983 El Nifno, all 10 events were probably produced by river dis- charges higher than in 1982-1983. The latest of these floods may be coeval with the flooding of the Colonial villa of Safia in 1720 and the penultimate event, which left deposits covering most of the surface area of Lam- bayeque and La Leche, is associated with Chimu pot- tery. The preceding flood is believed to have occurred between A.D. 1100 and 1300, and may correspond to deposits of the so-called "Nyamlap Flood." During spring of 1988, archaeologists of the Rio Abi- seo National Park Research Project continued archae- ological reconnaissance and exploration of the regional chronology of the northeastern Andes near Pataz. Co- directors Thomas Lennon (UCB) and Segundo Vas- quez (Universidad Nacional de Trujillo [UNT]), along with students Warren Church (YU) and Elke Cedr6n (UNT) explored various open sites and rockshelters in the grasslands just above the cloud forest. Several rock- shelters were tested, and two of them, Manachaqui and Chirimachay, produced abundant, well-preserved cul- tural materials in stratified contexts. The 2-m-deep cultural deposit at Manachaqui Cave contains stratified materials dating from the Preceram- ic period. The oldest remains include blades, burins, scrapers, and a projectile point much like the El Inga long-stemmed style from Ecuador. Early ceramic ma- terials include carinated vessels similar to those of the early IP at Pandanche in the Pacopampa area and Hua- caloma in the Cajamarca Valley. Some ceramics can be related to both the Montecristo and Abiseo phases defined in the upper cloud forests at Gran Pajaten. Chirimachay, located farther west, produced some Huari-related fineware sherds and some coarse wares, perhaps pertaining to the Middle Horizon (MH) and LIP. Inge Schellerup (National Museum of Denmark) cur- rently is investigating the southern part of the Chacha- poyas Province, Department of Amazonas. She reports the presence of fine kaolin pottery dating to Initial Cajamarca and Early Cajamarca phases on the eastern side of the Maraiion River in the Cascayunga Valley. In this same area, she documented LIP nucleated set- tlements in higher altitudinal zones (3,000-3,700 m). These sites were found in locations where agriculture and herding were feasible. Remnants of prehispanic terracing and drainage systems frequently still are vis- ible nearby. Typical features of these villages are large leveled plazas, platforms, and round residential struc- tures. The houses, generally from 3 to 8 m in diameter, have narrow raised doorways and internal stairways. Access to the entrance sometimes is provided by a ramp. Large subterranean stone-lined chambers for storage are located in the interior of these buildings. Larger structures are decorated with tenon heads, cor- nices, and protruding stone slabs that form geometric motifs such as triangles and meanders. At the village site of Patr6n Samana, a stone wall bisects the settle- ment, and a deep trench cuts off the settlement from the rest of the mountain ridge. These LIP sites share many cultural traits with coeval settlements in the mountainous area on the eastern side of the Marafion. Schellerup's work confirms that the Incas penetrated deep into the ceja de selva. She has located numerous Inca sites associated with stone terracing in southern Chachapoyas. In 1987, the Zaiia-Niepos Project directed by Tom D. Dillehay (University of Kentucky [UK]) and Patri- cia J. Netherly (University of Massachusetts) contin- ued with a five-month field season in the Nanchoc Quebrada of the upper Zafia Valley. Jack Rossen (UK) directed excavations at six small Preceramic open hab- itation sites in the Quebrada de Las Pircas, a dry lateral quebrada perpendicular to the Nanchoc River. His work revealed domestic architecture of wattle and daub and adobe, primary and secondary burials, and a wealth of materials within intact midden deposits. Radiocarbon measurements from two of these single-component sites indicate an age of approximately 7500-8000 B.P. Anal- ysis has focused on the definition of the local unifacial lithic industry, dubbed the Nanchoc tradition, and the separation and analysis of a variety of activity areas at these sites. The investigators infer an economy based on plant collecting within an environment of true trop- ical rain forest, in what is presently a semiarid zone. The research provides important evidence for a dis- tinctive and elaborate middle Preceramic culture in a lush western-slope setting. In 1988, the Archaeological Mission of the Univer- sity of Tokyo (UT) directed by Yoshio Onuki con- ducted investigations at Huacaloma in the Cajamarca Valley and Kuntur Wasi in the district of San Pablo. The Excavations at Huacaloma focused on the cere- monial architecture of the Late Huacaloma period. They uncovered a subterranean stairway that led from the base of the stepped platform to the uppermost of the three terraces. This stairway was roofed with large stone slabs and its interior walls were plastered with a thick layer of clay. The retaining walls of the stepped plat- form partially were cleared, and it was determined that during the last building phase of the Late Huacaloma 175</page><page sequence="11">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY period the construction measured 108.8 m from north to south and 81 m from east to west. It was super- imposed above earlier IP buildings of correspondingly smaller scale. Clay mural fragments painted in six colors were found at the foot of the four perimetric walls. These murals apparently decorated the exterior of the public architecture, but unfortunately they were com- pletely destroyed by the later, even more massive con- structions of the Layz6n culture. Residential areas seem to have occupied the flat land surrounding the Huaca- loma mound. A trench located to the east of the main mound revealed a series of superimposed houses dating to the Early Huacaloma and Late Huacaloma periods. Finally, Onuki reports that the investigations have con- firmed that the EL phase corresponds to the final part of the Late Huacaloma period. The UT investigations at the well-known site of Kuntur Wasi clarified the architectural layout and chronology of constructions at this site. A central stair- case measuring 11 m in width was located on the north- ern side of the terraced platform mound. Open stone- lined channels exist on both sides of the stairway, presumably to facilitate drainage. On the summit of the upper terrace is a semisubterranean quadrangular plaza measuring 24 m on a side. The stone walls of the plaza were plastered in clay and painted with white, black, red, and orange pigments. Next to it was a plat- form, 24 x 15 m in area, on which a free-standing temple structure probably stood. Subfloor canals ran beneath the central plaza and summit terrace, and the earliest of these had been cut into the bedrock. The investigations determined that the ceremonial complex had been built in two construction phases by a people using a Cupisnique-related ceramic assemblage, per- haps coeval with the Late Huacaloma occupation in the Cajamarca Valley. This assemblage is dissimilar from the IP and EH materials recovered from Cerro Blanco, located only 2 km to the north. A third con- struction phase at Kuntur Wasi, associated with ma- terials similar to the EL phase at Huacaloma, added a large summit platform to the east of the central plaza and changed the layout of the canal system. The most radical changes were made during the fourth and final building phase, when access to the central plaza was walled off and the central staircase was destroyed. A decapitated stone sculpture, probably carved centuries earlier, was recovered from a late transverse wall of large stones built on the summit. This last occupation of the site is characterized by Sotera-style ceramics, like those described for nearby Cerro Blanco, and very similar to the Layz6n period pottery in Cajamarca. Under the auspices of the INC in Trujillo, salvage archaeology is being carried out in the areas of the Santa and Chao valleys that will be affected by the Chavi- mochic irrigation system. In 1988, investigations in the Quebrada del Silencio in the Santa Valley revealed a large complex which included some 200 tombs, hab- itation areas, a field and irrigation system, and terrac- ing. At another site, they documented a stone building some 2 m in height, possibly of the Recuay culture. Beneath this occupation, they encountered a stone plat- form that supported a series of quadrangular chambers, a sunken circular pit, and a central hearth; these fea- tures may date to the late Preceramic. The Huamachuco Archaeological Project conducted its sixth field season in the north Peruvian sierra during the summer of 1987. The project concentrated on Mar- cahuamachuco, the dominant site in the region, which is now known to have been occupied from about A.D. 400 until the Inca conquest. Of special interest was a specific architectural type-the niched hall. These ma- sonry structures have great length (up to 60 m) com- bined with narrow width (5 to 10 m). While some are single story, many supported a second floor that may have functioned as space for civic or religious func- tions. Most of the niched halls display formally ar- ranged ornamental niches on one or more walls. The largest number and the most-elaborate examples of niched halls are located at El Castillo in the monu- mental core of the Maracahuamachuco. John Topic (Trent University) had seriated 20 of the niched halls and excavations were planned to test the seriation as well as to investigate the function of the structures. Excavations were carried out in 10 niched halls. Among the difficulties was the very great depth of fallen floor, roof, and wall material. One structure had little material in it and may never have been used. Another showed no real floor level and no roof supports. It may have been abandoned in the middle of construction as the result of an earthquake. Most of the other halls showed considerable remodeling. Lumps and semitab- ular chunks of a powdery white material were found in several of the cuts. These items appear to be lime pressed into rectangular forms. The only other context in which this material has been found in the Huama- chuco area is in an MH tomb at Cerro Amaru. The ceramic collections from the niched halls contain higher proportions of decorated wares than those from other contexts at the site, as well as many more cups, bowls, and spoons. The investigators suspect that the niched halls were used for dispensing hospitality. The number of wall tombs in the niched halls is high. In other cuts at Marcahuamachuco very little human bone has been recovered, but in the niched-hall ex- cavations it was clear that many burials were placed in the walls during construction. No unlooted tombs were found, but it appears that disarticulated skeletons were placed in the cavities in the wall. All ages were represented in the osteological material recovered, and some skeletons may have been incomplete. The quan- tity of bones and their disarticulated state make it un- likely that these were dedicatory burials. Instead, bones of individuals connected in some way to specific halls may have been moved to the halls from other tombs or from the caves under the site. H. Stanley Loten (Carleton University) directed the Huamachuco Architectural Project in 1986 and 1987. His focus in 1987 was preparation of a set of measured plans and profiles of gallery A (McCown's designation), the largest of the niched halls at Cerro del Castillo. Loten was able to demonstrate that unlike fort A (the largest of the circular galleries on Cerro de las Monjas) gallery A was planned and constructed as a single unit by well-coordinated work parties. At present, the dating of the niched halls is uncertain. Teresa and John Topic suspect, though, that the niched halls were built at different times, and that many of them were in use simultaneously and over long periods. 176 [Vol. 55, No. 1, 1990]</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT RESEARCH The form of the niched halls, the materials found in them, the methods by which they were built, and their spatial distribution within the site lead them to hy- pothesize that the halls were places of assembly, serving different segments of the Huamachuco population, and that the structures were created to display the wealth and the power of the lineage that built and maintained them. The Castillo and the plaza and structures adja- cent to it may have been communal space in which activities that integrated the entire community were carried out. The 1988 excavations at Marcahuamachuco focused on the Castillo, a four-story masonry structure 80 m in diameter that was the ceremonial and religious cen- ter of the ancient town from at least A.D. 700. Several moderate-scale excavations tested architectural details of the structure, followed collapsed walls, and attempt- ed to sort out the construction sequence. One large- scale stepped cut was laid out to extend down to the original floor level, located 9 m below the modem ground surface. This excavation penetrated the artifi- cial fill that had been placed in the structure, probably between A.D. 800 and 1100. Just above floor level, the Topics found the remains of 3 humans and 17 llamas. Several of the cuts on and around the Castillo uncov- ered carved stone blocks featuring animals and geo- metric motifs; these had been thrown into the fill when the Castillo was remodeled. Excavations in patios, courts, and halls adjacent to the Castillo shed additional light on the functioning of this part of the site. Among the more spectacular finds was a small offering pit containing 9.2 kilos of spon- dylus shell and hundreds of miniature turquoise stone carvings, many in the shape of shells, which had been smashed ritually. This same building produced llama sacrifices. Between 1985 and 1987, Joan Gero (University of South Carolina) surveyed and mapped EIP sites in the Callej6n de Huaylas, including the site of Anta Jirca (2 km south of Huaraz), but focused mostly closely on Kotu and Queyash. These two sites, approximately 10 km apart, manifest strong parallels in terms of site context, layout, chronology, and artifact variability that may relate to EIP "administration" or other public functions. Both sites occupy elongated ridge tops and have low mounds at each end, with a series of artifi- cially leveled courtyards and plazas extending between the mounds. The earliest occupation at both sites is represented by a small, late EH component, and both sites exhibit dense Huaraz White-on-red, as well as some Recuay, materials on the surface. In 1988, excavations were opened at Queyash (PAn3- 12) to test areas on the ridge top as well as on the northern terraces. All identified constructions at the site date to Huaraz times (ca. 200 B.C. to A.D. 0). Work at the west mound yielded a large sample of Huaraz-style bowl fragments along with concentrations of other ceremonial feasting equipment: musical in- struments (panpipes, a bone flute, and a ceramic trum- pet), colanders, spoons, and ladles (presumably for serving chicha), obsidian and quartz crystal knives, copper tupu pins, and a variety of llama figurines. Quantities of llama bone were associated with fire pits. The terrace area, excavated under the supervision of Steve Wegner (University of California, Berkeley), ex- hibited evidence of possible elite residential occupation and, unlike the ridge top itself, had well-represented strata of MH materials overlying the Huaraz levels. It is likely that the major Huaraz occupation at Queyash was contemporaneous with activity at the nearly center of Huaricoto. SOUTHERN PERU. W. Wurster (Kommission fir Allgemeine und Vergleichende Archaologie des Deutschen Archiologischen Instituts) continued the study of prehispanic urbanism in the Toparf Valley with two final field seasons in 1987. During May and June, he concluded a detailed survey of Pallanmarca (T46) in the central area of the Topara Valley at 600 m above sea level. In addition, Wurster excavated a 25-m2 area at Hua- quinf Este (T34). The diagnostic ceramic material in- dicates that the site was first inhabitated at the end of the MH and that it was used continually until the LH. Beneath about 1 m of collapsed stone and adobe walls, there was a construction consisting of large rectangular rooms. This building complex is characterized by clay mortar, white paint, fine-mud floors, access passage- ways, and a series of wooden posts that once supported the flat roofs of these rooms. Judging from the material associated with their floors, the main function of these rooms was extensive food preparation in large hearths. Abundant kitchenware of coarse quality was recovered. Clay figurines, a flute, weapons, and textile-production implements were also found in specific portions of the complex. Painted clay was used to finish the walls and floors of two rooms, and Wurster suggests that the rooms might have been associated with ceremonial activities. Research also revealed a shaft tomb with stone-lined circular walls. Although it had been looted previously, the tomb con- tained more than 20 skulls and bundles of long bones in the form of a secondary burial. During late 1987 Wurster excavated an EH site at Cerro Arena (Hacienda Vieja Alta, T7) located on a sand dune at 350 m near the mouth of the Toparf Valley. The rectangular and ovoid houses are built of mud-plastered and clay-mortared stone walls. They are scattered irregularly around a stone-faced mound. The excavation of these EH houses revealed a series of superimposed floors with wooden-post constructions. Abundant ceramics can be subdivided in four groups: one characterized by pitchers with short necks and neg- ative decoration in gray or colored tones on cream ware, perhaps related to Engel's Disco Verde style; another typified by neckless or short-necked globular vessels and incised decoration, probably related to Wallace's "Pato tradition" from Cafiete; Paracas pot- tery in the Pinta style, corresponding to Paracas Caver- nas from Pisco and Ocucaje; and the local variations of Paracas-style pottery known as San Pablo, Jahuay, Chongos, and Campana. The abundant remains of cul- tigens, as well as one copper fishhook and a large quan- tity of marine shell, indicate the importance of both agricultural and marine resources for this EH hamlet. Helaine Silverman (University of Illinois-Urbana) has been conducting site survey in the Ingenio Valley of the Nasca drainage, where she located 151 archae- 177</page><page sequence="13">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY ological sites in the upper valley, including an early Nasca civic-ceremonial center and 14 habitation sites with Paracas pottery. Paracas and Nasca 1-2 pottery also is found at sites in the middle valley. The project encountered EH pottery in a distinctive local style, dubbed the Grande style by Silverman, which displays similarities to materials from Ica and Chavin de Huan- tar. Thirty-eight sites with Grande ceramics were found in the upper valley. The inaccessible location and de- fensive walls of one Grande site suggest a defensive function. The largest Grande site in the upper valley covers 3.2 ha and appears to be a civic-ceremonial center. Silverman currently is studying the lower In- genio Valley. Another project of intensive archaeolog- ical reconnaissance, directed by Anita Cook (Catholic University), surveyed much of the lower Ica Valley during 1988. During the summer of 1987, Brian Bauer (University of Chicago [UC]) conducted a series of test excavations in the province of Paruro, Department of Cuzco. He identified two new ceramic styles dating prior to the LIP. The first, named Muyu Orqo after the site where it is most abundant, displays possible Tiahuanaco in- fluence. Fragments of Muyu Orqo pottery have been identified in the surface collections of 12 sites and in a number of test excavations. The strong use of black-, orange-, and black-and-white-pigmented slip paint on a dark-red background suggests the influence of late Tiahuanaco pottery and a MH date, as do the pedestal bases, rim tabs, raised facial features on keros, and other vessel forms. Several fragments of incised incen- sarios, related to early Tiahuanaco shapes, have been found at four sites in the Paruro region and appear most numerous at sites that also contain Muyu Orqo pottery. The second new ceramic style was first iden- tified in 1984 at a site south of the village of Ccoipa, in the District of Pacariqtambo, and similar materials subsequently were recovered at 34 other sites in the region. The Ccoipa style is characterized by a variety of designs, the most common of which is a central dot surrounded by nested rectangles alternating in color between dark red and black. These designs most com- monly occur on keros, but they sometimes appear on straight-sided bowls and globular pots. Bauer provi- sionally dates the Ccoipa style to the late EIP or the MH. Nicolaas van der Merwe (Harvard University [HU]) and Richard Burger (YU) continued their research on prehispanic diet through the use of stable carbon iso- topes in human remains. They completed a study of materials from Chavin de Huantar and Huaricoto and concluded that C3 cultigens, rather than maize, pro- vided the staple of the EH diet for the people living in these intermontane valleys. More recently, they began analysis of skeletal materials from Machu Picchu. Pre- liminary results indicate that maize was the dominant food in the diet of the people buried at this Inca site. BOLIVIA. During the 1988 field season, the Pro- yecto Wila Jawira, a multidisciplinary archaeological project directed by Alan Kolata (UC) and Oswaldo Rivera (Instituto Nacional de Arqueologia [INAR]) be- gan excavations at the site of Tiwanaku. Mapping and surface collection of the nonmonumental component of the site, directed by Kolata and James Mathews (UC), indicate that the site extends over an area of some 8-9 km2, a substantial upward revision over ear- lier size estimates. Linda Manzanilla and Maria Renee Boudoin (Uni- versidad Nacional Aut6noma de Mexico) conducted excavations of the pyramid of Akapana, located in Ti- wanaku's civic-ceremonial core. These excavations re- vealed a construction consisting of at least four massive stepped platforms and associated architectural fea- tures. In the northwest corner of the Akapana, Boudoin discovered the remains of an extensive ceramic offer- ing, consisting of broken finewares, predominantly polychrome keros dated to Tiwanaku IV. The plat- forms of the Akapana also contained the remains of what appear to be human and animal sacrifices, con- sisting of 20 individuals in a number of distinct con- texts. Analysis of the human remains is currently being conducted by Eric Woodard (UC) and the faunal ma- terial is being studied by Ann Webster (UC). Manzan- illa also excavated on the west side of the Akapana, on the top of the pyramid, and inside the sixteenth-century Spanish trench in order to shed light on the pyramid's construction history. John Janusek (UC), Howard Earnest (USDA Forest Service), Max Portugal Ortiz (INAR), and Javier Es- calante (INAR) carried out test excavations in the Pu- tuni, a possible palace complex to the west of Akapana. In excavations at the northwest corner of Putuni, Ear- nest and Janusek uncovered the remains of a complex system of subterranean canals and drainages that ap- pear to date to Tiwanaku IV, but which also exhibit evidence of substantial reworking in the subsequent phases. The excavations of Portugal and Escalante con- centrated on the center and the southeast of Putuni and further confirmed that the complex was used during multiple phases. Kolata excavated a third area in the civic-ceremonial area of Tiwanaku, called the Chunchukala. This zone is located north of Putuni and west of the Kalasasaya complex. A stone floor was uncovered extending to the north and east, in association with a large quantity of cut masonry blocks in disturbed contexts. Archaeol- ogists also found a fragment of a stone sculpture that appears to be a duplicate of a monolith located in the same area by Gregorio Cordero Miranda. The discov- ery of a llama sacrifice beneath the floor pavement seems to confirm the hypothesized ceremonial context for the area. Ann Webster and James Mathews (UC), assisted by Javier Escalante and Leo Ticcla (INAR), and Oscar Ayca (INC, Puno), began test excavations in the area east of the civic-ceremonial core of the site. Webster's excavations encountered dense refuse deposits, includ- ing substantial quantities of broken and burned ca- melid bones. The midden was adjacent to a terraced living platform. Mathews's excavations, slightly fur- ther to the east, yielded very different archaeological contexts, possibly related to the ritual disposal of cer- emonial refuse during Tiwanaku V. The rectilinear foundations of an adobe structure were noted, but there were no associated features and the structure's date could not be determined. Research in the hinterland of Tiwanaku continued 178 [Vol. 55, No. 1, 1990]</page><page sequence="14">CURRENT RESEARCH during the 1988 season. Michael Binford (HU), Mark Brenner, and Philip Moore (University of Florida) ex- tracted two laminated lake cores near the ports of Gua- qui and Huatajata, as part of the project's paleoecology component. The basal portions of the cores have been radiocarbon dated to 3500 and 3300 B.P. by Herbert Haas (Radiocarbon Laboratory, SMU). Charles Ortloff (FMC Corporation) and Mathews investigated a pre- hispanic canal, 20 m in width by 15 km in length, located west of Tiwanaku, which was associated with large expanses of raised fields. Mathews also began a survey of agricultural features in the Tiwanaku mid- valley, the preliminary results of which indicate the presence of some 2,000 ha of previously unreported fields. Kolata, Rivera, and Jorge Guzman (Unidad Aca- demica Campesina de la Universidad Cat6lica Boli- viana) continued with rehabilitation of raised fields. Yields from 50 ha of fields currently under experi- mental cultivation reconfirm the positive results ob- tained last year by Rehasuk, as well as those reported by Erickson and Garaycochea in Huatta, Peru. Juan Albarracin-Jordan began a pilot survey of the lower Tiwanaku Valley during the 1988 season. Results of this survey indicate a substantial population increase in Tiwanaku III times. Tiwanaku III sites appear to be associated with natural springs and seasonal streams, and they also are associated with terracing systems in the south side of the valley. Tiwanaku IV sites exhibit the same general patterns established in the Tiwanaku III phase, but they exhibit extensive raised-field con- struction as well. Jose Huidobro Bellido (Centro de Investigaciones Etnoarqueol6gicas) reports that excavations at Tiwa- naku under the auspices of INAR discovered the pres- ence of intentionally fire-hardened adobes associated with Tiwanaku I ceramics. He also notes the contin- uation of the JACHAPHASA archaeological project whose principal objective is the study of post-Tiwa- naku cemeteries. Gary Graffam (University of Toronto) carried out 12 months of field research in the Pampa Koani zone on the shores of Lake Titicaca during 1986 and 1987. This zone was part of the Tiwanaku heartland and later was incorporated into the Pacajes-Omasuyu polity be- fore being conquered by the Incas. The ruins of vast systems of raised-field agriculture still are visible throughout the area, and these fields and associated sites cover an estimated 4,400 ha. Graffman surveyed 1,300 ha of these ruins, focusing on the small, indi- vidual house mounds that were integrated within the field system. These mounds usually measured less than 20 m in length and were bordered by raised fields. Forty-two structures were located within the sample area and test excavations were carried out at seven of them. Surface collection was insufficient for assigning a cultural affiliation, but the excavations at five of the mounds yielded ceramic associations that point to a post-Tiahuanaco date; the other two mounds did not yield pottery adequate for temporal placement. Graf- fam recovered decorated Pacajes-Omasuyu ceramics in a variety of contexts, such as the core, the top of the mounds, and the adjacent fields and canals. Only one piece of decorated Tiwanaku pottery was discovered, and this came from an ambiguous context. Although the overall assemblage of decorated pottery was small, the evidence indicates that small house mounds were largely a post-Tiahuanaco phenomenon. Graffam con- cludes that raised field agriculture was maintained dur- ing post-Tiahuanaco times in the southern Titicaca Basin and that management at the ayllu level was suf- ficient for organizing and maintaining ridged-field ag- riculture. These findings contradict the traditional as- sumption that raised field agriculture in the Titicaca Basin was dependent on intensive bureaucratic labor management. Richard L. Burger SOUTHERN CONE In 1988, the Latin American Association of Biolog- ical Anthropology (ALAB) was founded in Santiago, Chile. The founding board members are Francisco Rothhammer (president-Chile), Jose Alberto Coci- lovo (vice president-Argentina), Monica Sanz (sec- retary-Uruguay), Sidia Callegar-Jacques (treasurer- Brazil), and Francisco Carnese (director-Argentina). ARGENTINA. Northwest. Jorge Fernandez (Consejo Nacional de Investigaci6nes Cientificas y Tecnicas [CONICET]) and the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia (INA) excavated the ceramic site of Cueva de Cristobal in the Quebrada de Humahuaca (Jujuy). The main feature of the site is rock art characterized by anthropomorphic figures wearing white painted feathers. Various lithics, including small, stemmed projectile points, and black-on-gray pottery were re- covered. Radiocarbon dates ranged from 2530 ? 100 B.P. (AC-1209) to 2880 ? 140 B.P. (AC-1212). Lidia Clara Garcia (CONICET, Universidad de Bue- nos Aires [UBA]), under the direction of Carlos As- chero, continued archaeological research at Formative period caves and rockshelters in Jujuy. Excavation in Azul Pampa suggests that semisedentary people from Alto Sapagua (3,400 m.a.s.l.) seasonally migrated to Inca Cueva Alero 1 (3,650 m.a.s.l.). One '4C date as- sociated with ceramics was processed at 2900 ? 70 B.P. (Beta-25116). Garcia is also excavating the To- mayoc rockshelter with the French mission headed by Daniele LaVallee. Both Formative and post-Formative deposits, 14C dated at 2230 ? 70 B.P. (GIF-7333) and 650 ? 60 B.P. (GIF-7332), respectively, were re- covered. Technical analysis of ceramic assemblages from sites in the Quebrada de Huamahuaca and Valliserrana areas was carried out by Maria Beatriz Cremonte (UBA). She reports that paste composition and "briquette" manufacture have established regional and interre- gional exchange patterns. Per Cornell (Gothenburg University) initiated a study of the emergence and growth of administrative and other central places in Santa Maria (Tucuman). Cornell studied one large site, El Pichao (Colalao), which mea- sures 6 km2 in size, to establish a local chronological sequence and to map internal site features. Excavated cultural materials indicate ceramic period to historic 179</page><page sequence="15">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY period occupation. This research is supported by Goth- enburg University, the Institute of Archaeology at Tu- cuman, and Stockholm University. Excavations were carried out by Myriam Noemi Tarrag6 (UBA, CONICET) at sites 15 and 16 in Rinc6n Chico in Santa Maria (Catamarca). A large patio and circular structure were recovered in association with metalworking, ceramic-production, and food-prepa- ration areas. Detailed analysis of wall- and roof-con- struction techniques are underway. The cultural ma- terials correspond to phase 5 and the Famabalasto phase (ca. A.D. 1500-1600) of the Santa Maria tradition. Tarrag6 and personnel from the Instituto Interdisci- plinario de Tilcara (IIT) also excavated several resi- dential sectors of the Pukara de Tilcara site. Floors and multiple burials of adults, subadults, and children were found in a mausoleum (casa tumba). Associated ce- ramics correspond to the Late Regional Development period. Veronica Williams (CONICET, UBA) pursued ar- chaeological research on Inca occupation in central Ca- tamarca. She excavated the Potrero-Chaquiago site (Andalgala) to identify residential, craft, storage, mil- itary, and administrative areas, and to understand the role of the local economy in the Inca state. Preliminary results suggest that textile and ceramic production were the most important economic activities. Elizabeth Pintar (CONICET) continued research on lithic assemblages and settlement patterns of early hunter-gatherers and pastoralists of the puna. Exca- vations at the Quebrada Seca 3 site primarily yielded finished lithic tools, suggesting seasonal reoccupation by transient groups. Maria Isabel Hernmndez Llosas (Fundaci6n Para La Educaci6n, La Ciencia y la Cultura) is investigating stylistic designs on ceramics and rock-art panels at 20 sites in the Quebrada de Pinto Scayoc (Huamachaca). Excavations at the Alero de las Circumstancias has revealed a long sequence of occupation associated with rock painting. Dolores Elkin, Carlos Aschero, Mercedes Podesti, and Elizabeth Pintar (CONICET, INA) conducted ex- cavation at the preceramic site of Quebrada Seca 3 in Antofagasta de la Sierra (Catamarca). Radiocarbon dates ranging from 4930 ? 110 B.P. (AC- 1 115) for the upper levels to 8670 ? 350 A.D. (AC-1118) for the lower levels are reported. Vicuna (Lama vicuna), llama (Lama glama), scrapers, stemmed projectile points, and other lithic debris were recovered from the lower levels. The lithics are stylistically similar to those recovered from nonlocal open-air sites in different environment zones. Cultural debris excavated from the upper levels (4500- 4900 B.P.) suggest a local pastoral lifeway. Undated occupational layers lie below the deeper levels. Elkin is focusing on the butchering patterns, taphonomy, and species identification of the faunal remains, especially guanaco. Aschero and Podesta also are investigating the as- sociation between certain settlement patterns and rock- art styles in Quebrada Seca 1-2, Inca Cueva (Jujuy), and sites in northern Chile. Certain styles are associ- ated with residential base camps and subsistence modes (hunter-gatherers or herders). Pampa. A. M. Aguerre and C. J. Gradin initiated archaeological research on human occupation in the semiarid, high basalt plateaus of the western Pampa. These results are being compared to findings in Casa de Piedra, Nefiquen, and Salado-Curaco. Aquerre and M6nica Bar6n (CONICET) are studying the late ce- ramic material excavated at Rinconada Giles (Rio Col- orado). N. Flegenheimer (CONICET) and M. Zarate inves- tigated local and regional stratigraphic and chronolog- ical sequences at Abrigo I (Cerro El Sombrero). Fell's Cave stemmed projectile points were recovered from the deeper levels. Experimental lithic research carried out by I. Ariet suggests that rocks from Abrigo I and from Paleoindian sites near Cerro La China were heat treated. In 1988, Maria Jos6 Figuerero (Universidad Na- cional de La Plata [UNLP]) continued investigations along the coast of Bahia Blanca and Rio Colorado. The project focuses on the exploitation of marine resources and on cultural affiliations between the Pampean and Patagonian coastlines. Valliserrana, Mendoza, Neuquen. Mariano Gam- bier continues investigations at several sites in Calin- gasta. At Barrealito, an Aguada period site, six distinct architectural clusters and 15 irrigation canals were ex- amined. Gambier suggests that the clusters represent different cultural groups coresiding at the site. A sub- terranean house was recovered at Sondeo 6. Well-con- structed floors and walls and a red-painted panel were found at Sondeo 3. These features predate the Bau- chaceta and Aguada cultures. Gambier and Mario Consens (Universidad de Uru- guay) also investigated rock art at Conconta, Agua Blanca, Las Burras, and Villicum in San Juan. Gambier also is involved in Catalina Teresa Michieli's study of Inca textiles and in Alicia Sanchez's investigation of aboriginal groups in Cuyo at the time of the Spanish Conquest. Amalia C. Sanguinetti de Bormida, Luis A. Borrero, Eduardo A. Crivelli, Hugo G. Nami, Damiana E. Cur- zio, Mabel Fernandez, Florencia Borella, and Ulises Pardinas (CONICET) carried out archaeological sur- vey in Piedra del Aguila (middle Limay River valley), where a reservoir is under construction. Preliminary results suggest that sites are of the local El Chocon and Alicura cultures. Jorge Fernandez (CONICET, INA) participated in several projects, one of which was the publication of archaeological research at Haichol cave in Neuquen. An interdisciplinary research team studied the chro- nology, floral and faunal remains, and other materials. Thirty-three 14C dates range between 7020 ? 120 B.P. (AC-69) and 225 ? 85 B.P. (AA-3095). Several sub- sistence changes were recorded during this period. Ear- ly hunters and gatherers (ca. 6000-4300 B.P.) using stemless, triangular arrow points, sharp cutting tools made of obsidian, and grinding stones were the first occupants. They were followed by intensive hunter- gatherers (2500-1300 B.P.) who produced more grind- ing stones, a wider variety of lithics, and pottery. The last occupants were historic gatherers and hunters who possessed tembetas, Valdivia pottery, pyramidal dice (presumably used for gambling), and small, triangular arrow points. Pinyon seeds (Araucaria araucana) were 180 [Vol. 55, No. 1, 1990]</page><page sequence="16">CURRENT RESEARCH recovered from porous surfaces of grinding stones. The earliest faunal record consists of rodents (Ctenomys, Cavia, Microcavia), carnivores (Conepatus, Dusicyon), and edentates (Chaetophractus). Guanaco, clams (Dip- lodon), and iiandu (Pterocnemia) were exploited later, around 2500 B.P. Human skeletal remains represent- ing 17 individuals were associated with the earliest occupation. Two skeletons resembled the Archaic types recovered by J. Bird at Cerro La Sota in southern Chile. Fernmndez also has 14C dates on two types of pottery, one a local pumicitic and basalt-andesite-tempered ware and the other a granitic-tempered ware from Chile or northern Patagonia. Radiocarbon dates for the oldest pottery (gray-black and brown wares) are 1250 ? 80 B.P. (AC-15), 1290 ? 110 B.P. (AC-897), 1290 + 70 B.P. (AC-75), 1440 ? 90 B.P. (AC-898), and 2130 + 110 B.P. (AC-900). Negative resist wares and Valdi- vian styles from Chile were introduced sometime be- tween A.D. 1500 and 1800. The remains of corn, squash, and European animals (horse, sheep, goat) were in the upper levels. Patagonia. Since 1984, Maria Estela Mansur- Franchomme (Centro Austral de Investigaci6nes Cien- tificas, CONICET) has investigated open-air base camps located on the lower Rio Gallegos. Test pits and block excavations were placed at site R1BK, '4C dated around 3200 ? 80 B.P. (LP-160). Surface materials from the site and others in Punta Bustamente suggest a mixed economy, primarily focused on the exploitation of guanaco and other terrestrial game and secondarily on shellfish, fish, and birds. Smaller sites were used for specialized activities, such as shellfish gathering or hunting. Scrapers and blades made of basalt and pet- rified wood were found at base camps; few lithics were recovered from specialized sites. Monsur-Fran- chomme interprets a terrestrial population intermit- tently exploiting marine resources, instead of a coastal- adapted population. For several years, Cecilia B. Perez de Micou (CON- ICET, UBA) has been undertaking a paleobotanical analysis of floral remains recovered from two com- ponents at Campo Moncada 2 in Chubut. The older component, 14C dated at 5080 ? 100 B.P. (AC-666), contains Chuguiraga avellanedae, Colliguaya sp., Ber- beres sp., Stipa sp., Atriplex sp., and other local plants. The most recent component, dated between 860 ? 80 B.P. (AC-668) and 780 ? 80 B.P. (AC 667), yielded the same species, in addition to Rumex sp., Typha sp., Mulinum spinosum, and Senecio sp. The presence of knots and cords made of reed suggests a basketry tech- nology. Perez also is carrying out an ethnobotanical study of present-day Patagonian plants. The objectives are to map the spatial distribution of floral zones, the seasonality and use of economic plants, and the natural and cultural factors determining the deposition and preservation of plants in archaeological sites. Maria Jose Figuerero (UNLP) and Guillermo Men- goni Gonalons (Programa de Estudios Prehist6ricos), in conjunction with the Museo Territorial de Ushuaia, are continuing archaeological survey on the coast of Bahia Golondrina. A high density of small-to-medi- um-size sites have been located at different elevations of the hilly coastline. Surface-collected materials in- clude various types of stone tools made of local cherts, numerous faunal remains, and bone tools made of ma- rine animals. One excavated multicomponent shell midden (Tolkeyen) contained well-preserved plant re- mains, a rarity in Tierra del Fuego, and diagnostic artifacts indicative of human occupation over the last two millennia. The site stratigraphy suggests minor sea- level changes during the late Holocene period. In 1988, Laura Lucia Miotti (UNLP, CONICET) continued archaeological research on the central pla- teau between the Rio Deseado and Rio Chalia. Two sites were excavated. Laguna Sierras Blancas is an open- air lithic workshop, located at the edge of a saltwater lagoon. Diagnostic lithics recovered from the deeper levels correspond to the late Pleistocene and early Ho- locene cultural levels at Los Toldos. Piedra Museo is a stratified cave site which, along with others, exhibits the only painted and pecked rock art discovered to date in the area. Miotti also is examining the faunal remains recovered from Los Toldos and participating in a multidisciplinary project focused on the archae- ology of Punta Walichu. Several rockshelters, caves (with painted rock art), and deeply stratified open-air sites have been discovered. An educational and tourist program is underway to inform the public of the value of archaeological sites and the prehistory of the region, and to establish open-air museum sites. Ana M. Aguerre (Instituto de Ciencias Antropolo- gicas, CONICET) and Carlos J. Gradin (INA, CON- ICET) continued research in Rio Pinturas (Santa Cruz) on changing adaptive systems and resource-procure- ment strategies over the past 9,000 years. Examining the relation between group territories and clusters of rock-art sites is the main research objective. Settle- ment-pattern analysis has focused on the exploitation of salt in Canadon Caracoles, obsidian in the foothills and plateaus of Lago Buenos Aires and Lago Ghio, and paint pigment in other areas. Excavation at one site, Prusto El Rodeo, has yielded three human skeletons '4C dated between 4860 B.P. and 1380 B.P. Associated firepits and bone remains of several animal species suggest a ritual offering. One skeleton, under study by Z. Ceirano (Instituto Nacional del Cuero), was wrapped in a guanaco skin and associated with paint pigments and adornments. R. Guich6n (Ministerio de Educaci6n de Chile, CONICET) is examining the human remains for nutritional and pathological data, and A. M. Aguerre and I. Pereda are studying the faunal remains. Aguerre also is processing data recovered from excavations at Cueva 4 de la Martita. Preliminary results suggest that the cave was occupied by Toldense hunters between 8,000 and 5,000 years ago. Additional excavation was carried out in the deeper levels (6 and 7) of Alero Cardenas. Under the auspices of the Direcci6n de Cul- tura de la Provincia del Chubut, Gradin and Aguerre also have continued archaeological investigations on the Kanquel Plateau and in Chubut. This project is associated with the salvage work ofR. Scandroglio and M. Onetto. Hugo Nami (UBA, CONICET) reports on his ty- pological and replicative analyses of lithics (especially a microblade industry) from several sites in Piedra del Aguila (Nefiquen and Rio Negro). This research is com- plemented by archaeological reconnaissance of quarry sites and by replicative work on projectile points and 181</page><page sequence="17">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY blades from early occupation levels at Cueva Trafal I, Cueva 4 de la Martita, Fell's Cave I, and Campo Mon- cuda 2. Nami's objective is to formulate a model to explain changing technological systems. He also plans to examine Paleoindian occupation in Rio Chico and Santa Cruz. A comparative analysis of archaeological materials recovered from Estancia Maria Luisa and Cabo San Pablo in Tierra del Fuego is underway by Jos6 Luis Lanata (UBA, Programa de Estudios Prehist6ricas [PREP], CONICET) and Luis Alberto Borrero (UBA, PREP, CONICET). The objective is to examine adap- tive systems on the east coast over the past 1,000 years. In conjunction with the Museo Territorial de Ushuaia, they also gathered data on local environmental changes and taphonomical patterns in order to expand their comparative faunal collection. Limited excavations also were carried out at Site SP4. In addition, salvage ar- chaeological work, sponsored by Hidrono-UBA, was conducted by Lanata and Borrero in Piedra del Aquila. Lanata and Borrero also initiated work on different cultural processes in the northern and southern areas of the Strait of Magellan and examined previously col- lected artifact assemblages from Fell's Cave, Alero del Diablo, and Cueva del Medio. In 1989, Vivian G. Scheinsohn and Osvaldo Herrera continued work on the classification and technomor- phological analysis of bone tools from several sites in the Canal Beagle. Scheinsohn is focusing on sites of all time periods, the critria selected by archaeologists for classification, the relation between tool type and ma- terial type, the mechanical bone properties of various animal species, manufacturing techniques and stylistic forms, and the hunting strategies of ancient Fuegians. Herrera also continues zooarchaeological research on faunal collections from Cerro Casa de Piedra 5 (Santa Cruz), Piedra Parada, Campo Moneada, Tunel, and Shumakush sites. Herrera and Scheinsohn also began a micro-use-wear study of bone tools from several sites in Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. Comparative replication and ar- chaeological analysis of penguin, bird, deer, guanaco, and sea lion were carried out. CHILE. Atacama. Mario Rivera (Universidad de Tarapaca) notes that final excavation reports for sev- eral sites in the Azapa valley have been published. The Universidad de Tarapaca and the Fundaci6n J. B. Bird also have published a Spanish edition of Bird's classic work Excavaciones en el Norte de Chile (1943). Rivera also collaborated with Manuela Dittmar and W. Bern- hard (Universitat Mainz) to investigate the biological origins of Tiwanaku populations in northern Chile and their relation to Aymara populations. Another project, focused on prehistoric interethnic relations between San Pedro de Atacama and northwest Argentina, was initiated by Rivera and Jose A. Perez under the aus- pices of the Museo Etnografico de Buenos Aires and CONICET. Rivera also continued work on biological, genetic, and nutritional aspects of Chinchorro mum- mies. These findings are compared with data on Am- azonian groups. Several other scientists are collaborat- ing, including M. Kelly, A. Aufderheide, L. Tieszen, and J. Shipman. In 1988, Mario Orellana (Universidad de Chile [UC]) and Agustin Llagostera (Universidad del Norte) in- vestigated the Calor site. Excavations focused on a multicomponent structure that contained early ceram- ic assemblages, lithic debitage, agricultural imple- ments, and a large quantity of camelid, bird, and other bones. Postholes, storage pits, and other debris relate Calor to the nearby Tulor site. One '4C date from an early ceramic level was processed at 140 ? 70 B.C. Jose A. Berenguer and Jose I. Martinez (Museo Chi- leno de Arte Precolombino [MCAP]) continued re- search on rock-art styles in the upper Rio Loa. Ber- enguer and Martinez view rock art as a dynamic ritual and mythical representation of social and economic organization. In conjunction with Pedro Mege, Ivan Caceres, Viviana Manriquez, and Paola Moreno (MCAP), they also initiated a study of the functional and symbolic relations between Kalina and Taira rock- art styles (characterized by camelid scenes) and herder sites. To date, 144 sites, including 27 Kalina and Taira sites and 11 rockshelters have been recorded. Radio- carbon and TL dates range from 6250 ? 240 (Beta- 29763) and 940 ? 100 (UCTL-137). A 4,000-year as- sociation is suggested between habitation and rock-art sites and camelid herding. Carlos Aldunate (MCAP), Victoria Castro (UC), Luis Cornejo (MCAP), Jose Luis Martinez (MCAP, UC), and Fernando Maldonado (MCAP), in conjunction with students from the Universidad de Chile, excavated the site of Turin in the middle Rio Salado. They also lo- cated several new Inca settlements in the high puna. Studies of bone, ceramic, stone, architecture, and other material recovered from Turin are underway for the purpose of defining intra- and intersite activity areas and for distinguishing pre-Inca and Inca occupational foci. Research at Turin has been supported by Fun- daci6n de Ciencias y Tecnologia, UC, and the towns of Turin and Paniri. In 1989, the Organization of American States sponsored an international sympo- sium at Turin. Miguel Cervillino of the Museo Regional de Ata- cama (MRA) and colleagues from other institutions carried out several projects. Cervillino, Gast6n Cas- tillo, and Nelson Sills made topographic maps of sites in the Quebrada Finca de Chaniaral. Analysis of re- covered cultural materials is underway. The first '4C date from a ceramic site in this part of Chile was pro- cessed at 1610 ? 60 B.P. Extensive survey and the collection of moder floral and faunal material also was initiated in the Chafiaral cordillera, particularly in the upper Rio Copiapo. This work was carried out in collaboration with Hans Nie- meyer (Museo Nacional de Historia Natural [MNHN]) and Gast6n Castillo (Museo Arqueol6gico de La Serena [MALS]). A short field season focused on the Carri- zalillo Chico, Quebrada Seca, and Puntilla Blanca sites in Rio Pulido. A 14C sample from Quebrada Seca was processed at 1230 ? 60 B.P. The MRA also analyzed several prehispanic metal objects and carried out archaeological survey at the ceramic sites of Vega Redonda and Quebrada de Las Pinturas in the Quebrada de Paipote. Cervellino and associates also continued archival work with the Ser- vicio Nacional de Geologia y Mineria de Atacama. The 182 [Vol. 55, No. 1, 1990]</page><page sequence="18">CURRENT RESEARCH objective is to locate and protect prehispanic and co- lonial period mines in the area. Several field expedi- tions also were initiated in Iglesia Colorado (Rio Puli- do), including salvage excavation of several Inca- Diaguita sites. The Consejo de Monumentos Naciona- les and the MNHN are sponsoring this work. In 1988, a group of archeologists headed by Hans Niemeyer, Gonzalo Ampuero and Marcos Buscupovic (Museo de La Serena), and Jorge Zambra (Museo del Huasco) excavated the Cemeterio Alto del Carmen. Eleven Diaguita and Diaguita-Inca tombs, containing Cuzquefia and local pottery and shell jewelry, were discovered. Separate residential and storage areas, in- cluding complex Inca and Colonial period architecture, were recorded. These sites are located at the conjunc- tion of the El Carmen and El Transito rivers, where lateral roads headed west to the coast and the Paitanas Valley and south to the Carmen Valley. Valles Transversalles, Central Valley. Gast6n Cas- tillo (MALS) began a long-term settlement pattern study of the Rio Choapa and its tributaries. He reports that Paleoindian sites were found on the coast and Archaic period sites in the interior valleys and mountains. The late ceramic sites are of the Bato-Molle-Llolleo cul- tures. Late Diaguita pottery phases are affiliated more with southern areas than northern areas. Sites of all periods exhibit rock art. Salvage excavation was carried out at Site CHF 15.01 by Ivan Caceres Rogue (UC, Municipalidad de Rengo) on the Rio Claro. Human burials were associated with local pottery styles (Inca-Diaguita and Aconcagua), necklaces, and copper objects. In central Chile, Ruben Stehberg (MNHN) and col- leagues completed two extensive surveys of the wide- spread Inca road network in the upper Rio Huasco. The main north-to-south road extends 70 km from Tronquitos de Montosa to Paso Valeriano. Four sites were mapped and tested. The main east-to-west lateral road extends 30 km from Rio Grande to Vallenor, passing through high-altitude grazing lands. This road is associated with two large tambos (Pasteadero and Colinai) characterized by habitation areas, storage units, and corrals. Inca-Diaguita sherds were recovered from all sites. Stehberg plans to investigate Inca roads in the Elqui, Limari, Illapel, and Aconcagua valleys in the future, a study that, when completed, will cover a 1,500- km-long section of central Chile. He notes that the Inca established a much more complex and extensive state structure in the area than previously realized. Javier Simonetti and Luis Cornejo (MCAP) began an archaeological investigation of prehistoric ecologi- cal and cultural change in the precordillera of central Chile. Preliminary results indicate continuous occu- pation of rockshelters from the late Archaic period (5030 ? 80 B.P., Beta-25725) to early ceramic period (1520 ? 280 B.P., Beta-26376). Faunal remains re- covered from excavated sites suggest reduced vegeta- tion over this time span. Burned teeth of large rodents suggest that these animals were a staple of the local diet. For the first time in Chile, 180 isotope studies were carried out on marine shells from sites on the central coast to measure paleotemperatures over the past 5,000 years. Fernanda Falabella (UC) and Alberto Pollastri (Centro Chileno de Energia Nuclear) report that several species of moder marine shells have been tested, with Concholepas concholepas showing the most promising results. Modern Concholepas provides a reading of per- cent 8 value of 1.9 = +? 13.1?C. The results from 70 archaeological specimens show few climatic and en- vironmental changes over the past few millennia. Two percentage values taken on archaeological specimens were: x 52.23 (12.4?C) for the late preceramic period (1500 B.C.) and x 51.42 (15.6?C) for the Llolleo II ceramic period. Warmer and drier episodes similar to today's climate occurred between A.D. 400 and 800. In 1988, Falabella also continued investigations at the LEP-C, Marbella, and El Mercurio sites. LEP-C is a multicomponent habitation and cemetery site dating to the Archaic period ('4C date of 3540 ? 160 B.P., Beta-18529) and Llolleo ceramic period (eight '4C and TL dates ranging from 93 B.C. [UCTL-94] to A.D. 710 [1240 ? 90 B.P., Beta-18530]. Marbella I belongs to the Bato tradition (TL date of A.D. 260 + 100, UCTL- 22) in the Rio Aconcagua valley to the north. This research is shedding new light on local settlement-sub- sistence patterns and on connections between early ce- ramic cultures of central Chile and the Molle culture of the semiarid north. El Mercurio is an intact site located on the Rio Mapocho in the Santiago Basin. This site dates around A.D. 100 and has habitation structures and human burials. Fernanda Planella, An- tonia Benavente, and Carlos Thomas (UC) are working with Falabella on different phases of this research. Pla- nella and Falabella are establishing a comparative flo- ral and faunal collection for multidisciplinary research on regional biotic resources. These data will be used with ethnohistorical and archaeological information to reconstruct preconquest vegetation patterns. Araucania. Zulema Sequel and Orlando Campana von Vriessen have carried out paleoecological and ar- chaeological research at several coastal and island sites near Concepci6n. Their main interest is prehistoric human exploitation of marine resources and changing sea levels and coastal environments. Sequel and von Vriessen have excavated the Bellavista I and Raqui- Tubal sites. Bellavista I is a deeply stratified preceramic and ceramic shell midden '4C dated around 3870 ? 80 B.P. Human remains associated with shell and bone adornments were found. The recovered marine re- sources include Tagelus dombeii (Lamarck), Charo- romytilus chorus (Molina), Ensis macha (Molina), Os- trea chilensis (Philippi), and several species of fish. The Raqui-Tubal midden dates between 8500 and 4500 B.P. and contains two marine species--Clamys pur- purata (Lamarck) and Ostrea chilensis-that are ex- tinct in the area today, but are found further north in warmer, Mediterranean-like water. Their presence sug- gests a warming trend during late Pleistocene and early Holocene times. A cool and wet period is indicated between 6500 and 4500 B.P. Several species of birds, sea lions, and small terrestrial animals were recovered from both sites. Ximena Navarro (Universidad Austral de Chile [UAC]) conducted archaeological survey on the coast near Valdivia. Numerous shell middens and cave sites dating from Archaic to late historic times were re- corded. Most middens (San Carlos, Curinanco, Pichi- 183</page><page sequence="19">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY cullin, Cheuque, and Ronea) are small in size, located in protected bays and inlets, and date to the late historic period. The presence of deer and bird bones suggest terrestrial hunting as a primary activity. The ceramics show strong affiliations with groups residing in the cen- tral valley and precordillera. A wide variety of local and nonlocal lithic material also appears. Navarro is working with ecologists to study the impact of human exploitation on marine resources, particularly the mus- sel Mesodesma donacium, and on the maritime envi- ronment. The objective is to conserve both the ar- chaeological and maritime resources. In 1988, Marijke van Meurs (Leiden University and Amsterdam University) and Americo Gordon (MNHN, Temuco) carried out excavation at the Monkul 1 shell midden, located in a river bank about 4 km from the Pacific Ocean. The midden contains Mytilus chilensis and Elminias kingii shells, in addition to a hearth and lithics. Excavations were continued at the sixteenth-century Spanish fortress of Casa Fuerte Santa Sylvia (Puc6n) by Americo Gordon. The architectural foundations of a church, associated with human burials, and two large residential compounds were recovered. European ar- tifacts indicate that the fortress was occupied by a Spanish encomendero between 1558 and 1599. The research is supported by the Sociedad Agricola El Coi- gue, the owners of the fortress, Benjamin Davis and Sylvia Lecaros de Davis, the Consejo Nacional de In- vestigaci6nes, and the Fondo de Investigaci6nes Cien- tificas y Tcnicas. Excavation and ethnohistorical investigation contin- ued at the sixteenth-century Spanish fortress of Villa- rica, located in the foothills of the Andes near Temuco. Jose Saavedra and Patricio Sananza (UAC), in con- sultation with T. Dillehay (University of Kentucky), report that the fort was occupied between 1598 and 1602 and that it was destroyed by fire, probably burned by the Mapuche. Three types of ceramics have been recovered (Mapuche, Mapuche-Spanish, and Euro- pean) that permit the study of interaction between dif- ferent groups. Villa-rica was one of several forts located along the southern frontier of the Spanish empire. The project is supported by the Pontifica Universidad Ca- t6lica de Chile, CONICYT, and the Municipalidad de Villarrica. Patricia Soto-Heims (Muse&amp; de L'Homme, Paris) is investigating isonymy (Crow and Mange's method) and inbreeding patterns in present-day Mapuche popula- tions. Anthropometric and patronym and matronym analyses suggest a wider range of variation for females, as opposed to males, in the Quetrahue area. Patagonia. Last year I summarized the work of Hugo Nami (Universidad de Magallanes) at the Cueva del Medio in Seno de Ultimo Esperanza. He now re- ports two 14C dates of 9595 ? 115 B.P. and 12390 + 180 B.P. from the deeper levels of the cave. Patricia Soto-Heim is studying prehistoric human skeletal remains from several sites. She reports that cremated remains of burials from Cueva Lago Sofia are similar to those from the Cerro Sota and Palli Aike sites. Canals. Carlos Ocampo (UC) received a research fellowship from the Swedish government to carry out an archival study in Stockholm of historic travelers' and sailors' accounts of Fuegian indigenous groups. Patricia Curry (Cambridge University) continued laboratory work on archaeological materials collected around Puerto Eden. Radiocarbon dates from sites in Puerto Rio Frio, Morton Island, and Puerto Eden sug- gest human habitation around 1500 B.P. Preliminary examination of stratigraphic columns indicates several occupational phases, characterized by vertical discon- tinuities and distinct faunal assemblages. Curry also is assessing the potential of various chemical and mi- croanalytical techniques to provide data on human be- havior from the types of archaeological deposits found in the canals, where preservation is poor and indige- nous technology was based on perishable materials. Soil and midden samples collected in 1988 are being tested to identify the most effective procedures and to guide the strategy to be used in fieldwork planned to resume at Puerto Eden. Antarctica. Claudio Paredes Diaz (Instituto An- tarctico Chileno) and a biological research team in- vestigated the recovery of one human skull while work- ing in Cape Sherriff (Shetland Island). Excavation suggested that the skull represents a historic mariner who died and was buried while hunting whales. Tom D. Dillehay 184 [Vol. 55, No. 1, 1990]</page></plain_text>
