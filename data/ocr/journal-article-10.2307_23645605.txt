<plain_text><page sequence="1">THEMED SECTION: REORGANIZATION AND RESILIENCE STATE COLLAPSE AND HOUSEHOLD RESILIENCE IN THE OAXACA VALLEY OF MEXICO Ronald K. Faulseit A two-year project of survey, surface collection, and excavation on the hill of Cerro Danush within the site of Dainzú Macuilxóchitl in Oaxaca, Mexico, was focused on identifying and characterizing the Late Classic (A.D. 600-850/900) and Early Postclassic (A.D. 850/900-1300) components of the site, which coincide with the political fragmentation and reor ganization of complex society within the Valley of Oaxaca. The transition in sociopolitical organization from the Classic to Postclassic has been the subject of several research projects, but few, if any, have clearly identified an Early Postclassic settlement. A radiocarbon analysis of charcoal samples collected during the excavation of a residential complex on Cerro Danush reveals its most recent period of occupation to be between A.D. 1000 and 1300, placing it firmly within the Early Postclassic. The excavation data are contextualized with data from the surface collection, illuminating patterns of Late Classic political fragmentation and Early Postclassic household resilience. Since Dainzú-Macuilxóchitl emerged in the Late Postclassic (A.D. 1300-1521) as a powerful city-state, exploring its Early Postclassic component contributes to the study of how societies reorganize on a local level after the collapse of centralized authority, such as the Classic period Monte Albán state. Un proyecto de dos años con periodos de trabajo en campo, enfocados unos en la recolección de superficie y otros en excava ciones en Cerro Danush, dentro del sitio de Dainzú-Macuilxóchitl en Oaxaca, México, tuvo como meta identificar y carac terizar los componentes del Clásico Tardío (600-900 d.C.) y del Postclásico Temprano (900-1300 d.C.) del sitio, los cuales coinciden con la fragmentación y reorganización política de la sociedad compleja dentro del valle de Oaxaca. La transición en la organización socio-política del Clásico al Postclásico ha sido el tema de varios proyectos de investigación, pero pocos, si es que alguno, han podido identificar y definir claramente un asentamiento del Postclásico Temprano. El análisis radio carbónico de las muestras de carbón recogidas durante la excavación de un complejo residencial en Cerro Danush revela que su periodo de ocupación más reciente ocurrió entre 900 y 1300 d.C., ubicando claramente a esa ocupación durante el Post clásico Temprano. Los datos de excavación se contextualizan con datos de la recolección de superficie, arrojando luz sobre los patrones de fragmentación política en el Clásico Tardío y la resistencia doméstica en el Postclásico Temprano. Puesto que Dainzú-Macuilxóchitl emergió en el Postclásico Tardío (1300-1521 d.C.) como una poderosa ciudad-estado, explorar su com ponente del Postclásico Temprano contribuye al estudio de cómo las sociedades se reorganizan localmente después del colapso de la autoridad centralizada, como ocurrió con el estado de Monte Albán del periodo Clásico. Over the last 40 years, scholars have devoted been paid to what occurs after collapse.

As this lineage grew in power and prestige, settlement became more concentrated around it, and by the Late Postclas sic the remaining occupied terraces on Cerro Danush were abandoned in favor of nucleated set tlement within the burgeoning city-state. While other sites, such as Lambityeco (Lind and Urcid 2010) and Jalieza (Elson 2011), also show evidence for reduced Early Postclassic occu pation, they appear to have been completely aban doned by the Late Postclassic, when towns like Macuilxóchitl were emerging as important regional authorities (Oudijk 2000; Whitecotton 1977). Colo nial-period documents, such as the Relaciones Geográficas of Oaxaca (Acuña 1982), suggest that prior to European contact, Macuilxóchitl played a prominent role along with other powerful balka nized (Marcus and Flannery 1983) city-states (Oudijk 2002; Winter 1989b) like Cuilapan, Mitla, Zaachila, and Tehuantepec. Excavations at these sites, as well as further excavation at Dainzú Macuilxóchitl, may yield more evidence for Early Postclassic origins for their Late Postclassic civic ceremonial cores and are essential to developing a better understanding of the Postclassic reorganiza tion that occurred throughout the valley.

Two phase names are reported because there are com peting methods for classifying the Valley of Oaxaca ceramic sequence: one that uses the original system established by Caso et al. (1967), where phases are identified with the term Monte Albán followed by roman numerals (e.g., Monte Albán II), and one that uses a system of phase names (e.g., Pitao) first proposed by Lind (1991-1992). These proposed phases do not exactly correlate with one another chronologically, especially in the Late Classic and Early Postclassic, but there is considerable overlap, and I have coupled them based on similarities in the diagnostic materials, not chronology. 2. My use of the term orange paste simply reflects the color of the ceramic fragments recovered and does not refer to the "Z Fine Orange" (Paddock et al. 1968) or "Balancán Fine Orange" (Markens 2004; Martínez López et al. 2000) diagnostic ceramic types, which have contested chronologies in the Oaxaca Valley (Marcus and Flannery 1990; Markens 2004; Paddock 1983b). In fact, I did not recover a single frag ment of any Fine Orange type during the surface collection. 3. Terrace S20 was elevated above Terrace S19 by a stone retaining wall. It was small (surface area = 170 m2) and located directly below a vertical rock face. The excavation of several well-spaced 2-x-2-m units revealed a very shallow layer of soil and sediment on top of bedrock. This led to the conclusion that Terrace S20 was not a domestic terrace, but its retention wall actually served to protect the lower terrace from falling rocks, and it had subsequently filled in with sed iment that had eroded from above. Artifact densities were comparatively low on this terrace, and no archaeological fea tures were found.
