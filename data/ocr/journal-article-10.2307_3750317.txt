<plain_text><page sequence="1">Freud and the Freedom of the Sane R. A. SHARPE It is commonly allowed that madmen have no liberty. David Hume Freud seems to have been torn between a literary and a scientific model for his enterprises. On the one hand he stresses the scientific nature of his researches to an extent which makes the suspicious reader wonder whether he protests too much. On the other hand it is well known that he regarded many writers, though predominantly Shakespeare, as anticipa- ting his findings on the unconscious. In one famous passage in the Intro- ductory Lectures on Psycho-analysis he places his discovery of the un- conscious on a par with the discoveries of Darwin and Copernicus in their effect upon man's picture of himself.1 He is justified, of course, and if we add Marx to this triumvirate we add a figure even closer to Freud in claiming a scientific status for his work, a scientific status which is, to the uncommitted, dubious. Theodore Mischel2 argues that Freud increasingly construes neurotic behaviour upon the model of ordinary intentional behaviour and, though he continued to show interest in the view that the unconscious impulses which are repressed are physiological in nature, this ideal of a reduction of the psychological to the physiological became a less active ingredient in his published work as his collaboration with Fliess receded into the past. So although he may have paid lip service to some form of psycho-physical identity, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately no more or less than physical happenings in the neurones of the brain, in mature Freud this seems to have been an idly spinning wheel. Roy Schafer has recently pointed out3 that many of Freud's fol- lowers use the concepts of natural science (force, energy and discharge, etc.), whilst simultaneously retaining traces of anthropomorphism in their metapsychology. For instance Heinz Hartmann emphasizes the concept of a 'higher organizing function' which resists formulation in the mechan- 1 Introductory Lectures on Psycho-analysis, Pelican Freud Library, I, 326. 2 'Understanding Neurotic Behaviour', Understanding Persons, T.

Philosophy 55 1980 485</page><page sequence="2">R. A. Sharpe istic metapsychology he favours. Similar difficulties obtrude in the work of Waelder and Kohut. The significance of these conflicts leads Schafer to frame basic Freudian insights in terms of the theory of action, stressing the manner in which an action may be described in differing ways and thus allowing us to present the fact that a patient's behaviour may both tell and not tell us of his deepest anxieties. Yet curiously Schafer denies that freedom plays any part in his account whereas we would have expected a concept so central to agency to have an equally central role in any re- casting of psycho-analysis in terms of the theory of action. Whilst I share Schafer's conviction that action is crucial to any attempt to understand the nature of Freudian explanation, we cannot dismiss the question of human freedom. Indeed the puzzle I wish to tackle in this paper is what sort of explanation Freud can give of the subjective experience of loss of freedom experienced by neurotics. People who suffer from phobias or obsessions find their freedom to act thereby reduced. I shall argue that a Freudian understanding of this loss of freedom requires the physiological model of the sort described in the Project but that it is difficult to regard this model as much more than a metaphor. There remains a fundamental incoherence in the Freudian account of the behaviour of neurotics. Loss of freedom might seem even more apparent in schizophrenics and others of the more extreme cases of psychosis. Freud, however, rarely paid much attention to these cases and did not claim that analysis could help the insane. He does, though, consider one rather extraordinary case in some detail. The case of Dr Schreber, like the study of Jensen's story Gradiva, is a second-hand attempt at analysis, here based upon the auto- biography of a paranoid; Der wiirdigkeiten eines Nervenkranken (Memoirs of a Neurotic) was published in I903.4 This is a frank defence of the delu- sions of a paranoid coupled with the claim that his symptoms are not sufficiently disturbing to merit his incarceration. He suffered from nervous disorders on two occasions, firstly, when he stood as a candidate for the Reichstag and secondly when he became President of the Senate. The first illness was short lived and occurred in 1884-85; the second was much more severe and began in I893. Schreber was a highly intelligent and articulate man and his delusions took a particularly complex and fascinating form. Indeed one of his reasons for publishing his memoirs was his desire to contribute to religious progress. When his civil rights were restored in 1902 the judgment summarized his belief system. 'He believed that he had a mission to reform the world and to restore it to its lost state of bliss. This, however, he could only bring about if he were first transformed from a man into a woman.' This case differs from those histories of neurotics which we will consider in that Schreber, typically amongst sufferers from this sort of condition, 4 Collected Papers, 3 (case studies), 342. 486</page><page sequence="3">Freud and the Freedom of the Sane seems to have lost the capacity to recognize what is the case, a capacity he presumably once enjoyed. He thus differs from the irrational man, not so much in the contents of his beliefs, because many people have the strangest conceptions, but in his ability to see what the truth is. In contrast, the man who is irrational may, through self-deception or laziness or from a variety of other causes, fail to tailor his beliefs to the facts. Whilst he retains the capacity to do so, however, he remains sane but irrational. Part of the task of philosophy is to impart techniques of analysis with which we may subject our beliefs to critical examination. When we say that a man who is irrational is free we mean that he could apply, or could learn and then apply, methods of criticism by means of which he could enlighten himself or learn from the objections of others. As I have observed, Freud has no explicit or implicit account of the unfreedom of sufferers from these more severe conditions which fall, in our rough and ready classification, under the heading of psychoses. So in this paper I concentrate, faute de mieux, on the account which Freud could have given and occasionally suggests, of the unfreedom of the neurotic. Since the phenomenon of subjective loss of freedom is our starting point, it may be as well to spend some time illustrating this fact about neurotic patients. In the clinical study of the patient who has become known as the rat man,5 Freud describes the curious ritual the patient acted out. He would be at his desk working between midnight and one o'clock; finding it difficult to concentrate he would then go downstairs and open the door to an imagined visitor. Having closed the door, he then undressed and examined his penis in the hall mirror. Freud construes this as the rat man's attempt to placate his father by showing how hard he was working (at a time when others were in bed) and yet to defy his father by masturbating (the act of examining himself in the mirror). The rat man's helplessness in the face of these compulsions comes over very clearly in the clinical record. Phobias are perhaps more familiar. May I instance the recently reported case of a woman unable to enter any lavatory which had an overhead cistern. In a strange house she required a friend who would act as a scout before she could use the lavatory. As a third and lengthier example, let me quote from a very interesting personal record of mental illness, W. S. Stewart's The Divided Mind.6 Stewart was an intelligent and articulate man (a Cambridge graduate, no less, as Sir Cyril Burt so pertinently observes in his foreword) and something of a poet. He was forced to give up his career as a schoolmaster by an illness which involved extreme depression, apathy and anxiety, indeed the classic neurotic symptoms, and eventually, whilst in hospital, flowered into elaborate rituals which he describes as follows: 5 Ibid., 484. 6 Allen and Unwin, i964, 190ff. 487</page><page sequence="4">R. A. Sharpe I have never been subject to any experience so strange, or, at its onset, so terrifying. In its purely physical manifestations it was a series of rhythmic movements, contraction and relaxation of various muscles and manipulation by the hands and fingers in a kind of massage. It would start with the fingers of both hands locked at the back of the neck, while the thumbs exerted a strong but varying pressure at each side of the windpipe, digging in deeply at the base of the neck where it widens to join the shoulders. Then the thumbs and fingers would play with gentle circular movements and pressures over the face and head, sometimes turning the lobes of the ears clockwise and counter-clockwise, then doing the same with the whole ear, then pressing the circumference of the eyeballs in from each side towards the nose, and so on. This elaborate massage would go on from the head, face and neck downwards over the whole body, in a series of movements so complicated that if I had had to learn them from a manual of instructions it would have taken me months. Sometimes these exercises would last an hour or an hour and a half at a stretch, without repetition. They are really indescribable to anyone who has not suffered them. It was as though the hands and body took on a life of their own and performed these immensely elaborate and complicated rituals without reference to the mind, automatically. Or, as I thought of it then, as though they were possessed by another mind, more powerful and complex than my own. My own conscious mind, so far from co-operating, would protest in panic and exhaustion, as the body went on its strange way. But however much the mind protested, these involved and ritualistic movements would continue to their appointed end ... I had a gold fob-watch on a chain and this to me was a symbol of eternity, sometimes of the world, or the whole universe. I would take it out and swing it slowly in a circle from the end of its chain, then clasp it in the palms of my hands till it was hidden, and finally wind the chain three times round the body of the watch and clasp the whole tightly. All these were compulsive actions, many at the dictation of the Voice. Indisputably, as Szasz points out, these patients all suffer a 'subjective' sense of loss of freedom. I intend a minimum of theoretical overtones to this 'subjective sense' of loss of freedom. It merely records the phenomen- ological fact that these patients felt themselves compelled to act as they did or unable to act in the specified way. It is, if you like, the opposite of the phenomenological sense of freedom which most of us feel in ordinary contexts and which, no doubt, Dr Johnson had in mind when he uttered his famous riposte. As I have said, Freud was a fairly conventional determinist of a standard nineteenth-century sort. In the fullness of time he expected a theory which would enable us to explain and predict mental phenomena as an 488</page><page sequence="5">Freud and the Freedom of the Sane offshoot of the physiological explanation of the firing of neurones and synapses. Whether Freud was an epiphenomenalist or a proto-Australian materialist has been discussed but need not detain us. It is a familiar fact that he believed that all events are caused and one may find an echo of this in the rhetorical question that took Wittgenstein's fancy, 'Do you want to say, gentlemen, that changes in mental phenomena are guided by chance?' However, whilst paying his respects to this general conception, when he comes to discuss individual dreams, jokes, and slips of the tongue he uses concepts like 'meaning' and, 'sense'. He talks about the sense of dreams and parapraxes. Dreams, parapraxes and neurotic rituals have significance and their explanation is not to be found merely in terms of their being effects of some cause. In the circumstances it is understandable that some have viewed Freudian explanations as a species of hermeneutics. Consistent with this picture is the fact that mental illness is unlike physical illness in certain important respects. For the form the symptoms of hepatitis take are not, I imagine, culture-dependent. Whether one comes from Croydon or Calcutta, the disease will show symptoms invariant with respect to the social milieu of the patient. But the rat man's neurotic ritual could only have the significance Freud ascribed to it in a culture where people do not generally work between midnight and one and are normally clothed rather than unclothed. They incorporate elements only possible for a being who participates in social life and only intelligible to somebody familiar with that particular society. It is perhaps in virtue of this rather than in virtue of any attempt at communication by the patient that we can describe the rituals as signs rather than symptoms. These rituals distort accepted forms of social behaviour and the form the distor- tion takes reveals the nature of the patient's problems. The analyst endeavouring to make sense of these patterns of behaviour is in some ways like the reader endeavouring to make sense of a work of fiction. In both cases one is faced with a product which, one assumes, reflects certain characteristics of the agent. The behaviour is revealing of the patient's mental state; the novel reveals something about the intentions, sympathies and ideas of the author. More pertinently, both may contain elements which the agent could not consciously have controlled. The complexity of inter-relations in a great work of art goes well beyond what the author or composer could have foreseen and it is partly as a result of this that we feel entitled to assume that every element has some sort of role to play in the total effect of the story. In the same way Freud assumed that no element in a dream or a fantasy was without significance, a presupposition that Rieff plausibly relates to the critical assumption of density in works of art as well as justifying the astonishing ingenuity that Freud brings to the interpretation of dreams and parapraxes.7 7 Philip Rieff, Freud: the Mind of the Moralist (MIethuen, i965), I22. 489</page><page sequence="6">R. A. Sharpe Confirmation of this is to be found in the insouciance with which Freud interpreted fictional as well as genuine dreams, and the role played by the analysis of fantasies such as screen memories in his patients. It is noteworthy that as early as the eighteen-nineties Freud observed to Breuer that their studies lacked the 'serious stamp of science' and sounded more like fiction.8 Thirdly, such interpretations do not necessarily hold for other similar objects. A satisfactory scientific explanation explains, mutatis mutandis, like events and theories; therefore of necessity a scientific explanation is generalizable and provides a key elsewhere. And although the interpreta- tion of an action or of a work of art may depend upon our drawing on our interpretation of other events, it may not necessarily provide the interpreta- tion of quite similar actions or objects. The understanding of a work and of a copy or pastiche of it may require quite different considerations. Consider, for instance, the way that Vermeer's paintings are an expression of their time whereas van Meegeren's forgeries are not. As against this interpretation of Freud, it is noticeable that the form of mature Freudian explanation does in fact mirror one important, indeed paradigmatic form of scientific explanation; it is, in a phrase, a 'hidden mechanism' type of explanation. Overt behaviour which is difficult to understand is accounted for by the machinations of various sub-agents in the psyche rather as the observable symptoms of a disease are explained by the activities of bacilli at the microscopic level or as the Brownian motion is explained in terms of molecular movements. Having relinquished one form of scientism, Freud has embraced another. If physiological determinism is a sleeping partner at least in the explanations of human behaviour required in therapeutic contexts, the form of those explanations mirrors the way in which many phenomena studied in the sciences are explained. This has an important bearing on the next stage of my argument. II One central problem is in what sense, and for what agent, neurotic rituals are actions. In the passage quoted Stewart clearly regards the rituals as actions he performed and equally clearly regards them as something he was unable to avoid. Equally Freud is prepared to describe dreaming as involving an action on the part of some agent even though we cannot regard ourselves as responsible for what we dream or indeed dreaming as something we do (in any straightforward way). His use of terms like 8 For a general discussion of psycho-analysis, science and the arts see Rieff, passim. 490</page><page sequence="7">Freud and the Freedom of the Sane 'dream work' focus our attention on the way in which the censor is acting to modify the form the dream takes. Freud viewed adult dreams as fre- quently incorporating wishes whose nature was too shocking to be admitted en plein; they therefore had to be disguised in order to surface in the half-conscious world of the dream without being vetoed by the censor. In view of the lack of freedom which the neurotic displays, we might be tempted to regard what goes on as the effect of some neurological causes, the whole to be understood in terms of some physiologically determinist narrative. But although Freud is committed to determinism, his deter- minism is of no help in this particular case. We still need, even upon the assumption that all human action is determined, to distinguish between those which are apparently free and those which are apparently unfree. The very universality of the physiological account renders it useless as a specific tool for understanding the unfreedom of the neurotic. And, of course, apart from its failure to explain neurotic behaviour, there are general difficulties attached to determinism, not least for the psychologist propounding a new theory. Indeed Freud himself, when not openly advocating his determinism, often does not speak in causal terms. Apart from the references I gave earlier there is an otherwise puzzling remark as early as the Studies in Hysteria9 where he speaks of there being a rational connection between trauma and symptom. This commits him very strongly to the thesis that the form of explanation appropriate to neurotic illness is in terms of reasons, motives, intentions, etc. I do not wish to discuss in detail the extent to which this relation could be described as rational. On the face of it the claim is absurd since what distinguishes neurotic rituals is precisely the opposite, their irrationality. According to Freud, the rat man's ritual was designed simultaneously to affront and placate his father; but how could this be possible when his father had been dead for nine years? On the other hand if we view this as a form of perverse or distorted ration- ality and contrast it with a cause-effect relationship in which the question of rationality or irrationality cannot even arise then we can perhaps better appreciate Freud's contention as being a form of category claim. And then its incompatibility with the cause-effect form of explanation which his avowed determinism might seem to favour becomes more visible. A Freudian account which simultaneously recognizes the loss of freedom of the neurotic whilst avoiding a standardly causal explanation of a neuro- logical variety can, however, be given. Freud does not give any very explicit or lengthy account of the loss of freedom suffered by the neurotic. Indeed only in one case study have I been able to find so much as a hint that the account I shall propose is the one he would have held: 9 Pelican Freud Library, 3, 380-381. 49I</page><page sequence="8">R. A. Sharpe The content of his phobia was such as to impose a very great measure of restriction upon his freedom of movement, and that was its purpose.10 The explanation is that the agent is restricted by the activities of sub- agents within the person, i.e. the super-ego and id. This could never be explained in terms of the activity or suppression of physiological impulses by other physiological features, because then the element of agency would be irretrievably lost. The id, for Freud, is not governed by the Reality principle as the ego is but by the Pleasure principle. It pursues its own instinctual ends." But we can recognize the id as an agent without attributing to it powers of ratiocination simply by regarding it much as we regard animals as agents. Indeed Freud's use of the Platonic metaphor of horse and rider in describing man as having an animal and a rational nature seems to me very appropriate. The model then is that the unfree neurotic is unfree in the way that a man whose behaviour is constrained by other agents is unfree. This then is the general picture Freud offers of the commonwealth of the mind. As he says, it is 'no peaceful ... self-contained unity. It is rather to be compared to a modern State in which a mob, eager for enjoyment and destruction, has to be held down forcibly by a prudent superior class."12 It would be possible, of course, to leave the argument here. This is the theory of mind behind Freud's account of psycho-analysis and this is how it can provide an account of the unfreedom of the mentally ill. But I shall defend the theory of multiple agency within the personality against some objections before I raise some difficulties of my own. Philosophers like Thalberg,13 who object to the notion of mini-agents or homunculi operating within the person, have to find an alternative account, not just for the phenomena studied by Freud, but for such less theory-laden and commonplace observations as that of the compulsive gambler or drinker who is not in total command of his behaviour. In these cases, the agent admits both that he has done whatever it is that he has done and also both avers that he cannot help doing it and that in some respects he wanted to do it. The phenomenology of the situation is that he feels he cannot avoid doing what he is doing and yet that he admits that he has done it. An alternative account to the Freudian theory I have offered might be that all such actions are simply to be explained in terms of an inconsistency between the agent's behaviour and his professed standards. Perhaps this is Thalberg's way out. However, there remains a difference between the man who says that he believes in moderate drinking only 10 Collected Papers, 3, 280. 11 There are many discussions of this in Freud. See, for example, Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety (1936). 12 Rieff, ibid., 59. 13 'Freud's Anatomies of the Self', in Critical Essays on Freud, R. Wollheim (ed.) (Doubleday Anchor, 1974). 492</page><page sequence="9">Freud and the Freedom of the Sane and then inconsistently abandons his principles with no more ado when he reaches the bar and the man who, fighting with himself, nevertheless succumbs to the temptation and drinks himself insensate. In this last case it is, I argue, a natural explanation that the agent is not in control of certain sub-agents within him. As I have observed, we do not need to assume that the sub-agent is conscious of what it attempts to achieve. With Kenny I believe that both animals and human beings can be agents whilst unconscious of the exact nature of their acts.14 Suppose, now, that someone was to argue that a person who produces com- pulsive or obsessional behaviour was not acting any more than a man pushed over a cliff acts, what should one say? The answer is to point to the fact that the agent, whilst claiming that he cannot avoid doing these things, still avows that they are his actions. Do we wish to say that he is mistaken in claiming agency? Certainly, an agent could be mistaken about his responsibility. The obvious case is post-hypnotic suggestions. Nevertheless, even in these cases we are prepared to say that the agent did the action even though he was not responsible for it and we say exactly the same about the victim of a neurosis. The criteria for agency incorporate the recognition both of the origination of movements by an individual body and of their purposiveness. So I cannot see any general reason to deny that the neurotic acts in carrying through these compulsive rituals. The man who is overcome by lust or the man who is forced to cross himself when he sees three horse droppings is impelled by the agents within him to do so. The Freudian theory claims that the agents act in combination so that neurotic behaviour represents the outcome of a struggle in which no agent is entirely victorious. Theodore Mischel seeks to explain obsessional behaviour, not in terms of homunculi but in terms of self-deception. He argues that obsessional behaviour is one end of a continuum whose other pole is occupied by self-deception: When Freud says that in an obsessional neurosis 'the actual wording of the aggressive impulse is altogether unknown to the ego. .. [but] the super-ego behaves .., as though it knew the real wording' (ibid., p. I17), his point may be, not that we are to conceptualize the person in terms of homunculi, but that the neurotic has avoided the conflict by deceiving himself: his lack of awareness is motivated, he has made himself unconscious of an incompatible impulse which he knows, in one sense of that term, to be his. And he can do that only in so far as he can also keep himself unconscious of the technique he is intentionally using to deceive himself.15 But the differences between the compulsive neurotic and the self-deceiver are marked and very important. The self-deceiver's actions are by no 14 Will, Freedom and Power, Ch. IV (Blackwell, I975). 15 Ibid., 235. 493</page><page sequence="10">R. A. Sharpe means necessarily irrational per se. They may be irrational in that they flow from beliefs which are irrational. Thus a man whose son is an em- bezzler but who cannot bring himself to face the facts, may irrationally entrust his son with his company's funds. Once granted his irrational refusal to recognize that his son is untrustworthy, there is nothing irrational in his subsequent behaviour. It is only irrational in the light of the irrationality of his belief and its irrationality is parasitic upon that. But Paul Lorenz's behaviour was different in that it had no point; furthermore, its pointlessness was obvious to Lorenz himself, as well as to others. His behaviour could not be seen as being a means to any end he avowed. His nightly ritual of opening the door and then exposing himself in the mirror could only be given some sense by a psycho-analytic explanation. So the difference between the self-deceiver and the compulsive neurotic is the difference between the irrationality of belief and the irrationality of action; furthermore, the crucial point as far as the topic of this paper is concerned is that the self-deceiver is by no means unfree: he is not forced to believe what he does nor to behave as he does; the unfreedom of the neurotic cannot be accounted for by reference to self-deception. In the case of phobias and compulsive behaviour the actions indicate beliefs which the agent rejects; in the case of the self-deceiver his actions point to beliefs which we know he has grounds for rejecting but never- theless still holds. I conclude that self-deception and neurotic behaviour are not alike. Self-deception does play a part in the metapsychology of late Freud. Disavowal (verleugnen) is his term for the refusal of small boys to admit, in the face of observation, that little girls lack a penis. And, of course, rationalization is itself a form of self-deception. We may generate an 'end' which conveniently explains our behaviour or claim to be acting from motives other than those which actually generated our behaviour; whilst this is not invariably self-deception, sometimes it may be; it depends upon the extent to which the agent is suppressing an inkling that his or her behaviour may be described in other and less flattering terms. In the Introductory Lectures he makes a reference to the Socratic doctrine: (a neurosis would seem to be the result of a kind of ignorance-a not- knowing about mental events that one might know of'. III I am unfree if I am acting under threat to my person as well as if I am physically constrained. The bank manager who is forced to hand over the keys to his bank by a robber who holds a pistol to his head is generally recognized not to be acting freely, though he is acting. But if the keys are snatched from him, then, of course, he has not acted any more than a man 494</page><page sequence="11">Freud and the Freedom of the Sane who is thrown over a cliff acts. Actions which are unfree because they are under duress are such that the consequences of doing otherwise are so grave that no rational person could be expected to do other than behave as he does. Now which of these two models do I have in mind when I describe Freud as regarding the neurotic person as unfree? Well certainly it would be a mistake to regard the individual as deciding upon a form of compulsive or obsessional behaviour because the consequences of any alternative would be particularly unpleasant. Neurotic behaviour may be the alternative to some more catastrophic breakdown but it is implausible to suppose that the individual decides between the two and that the choice is rational. The examples I quoted at the outset showed that the individual felt unable to act otherwise. In some sense or other he felt that his essential self was not an agent. The model must then be that of physical constraint. It is only in the broad sense of 'self' that the self can be said to be the agent of the neurotic behaviour. If this picture is correct it leads us to ask which of the various agents Freud recognizes in the human psyche is having his freedom curtailed. Is it the ego, the super-ego or the id? Freud would, I believe, have replied that it is the ego. He explicitly claimed on one occasion that it is the ego which is neurotic. It is by therapy that the beleaguered ego can overcome the recalcitrant id. It is an 'instrument to enable the ego to push its conquest of the id still further'.16 The ego is caught between the implacable claims of conscience embodied in the super-ego and the demands of the instincts which have to be satisfied. In the healthy individual, reason, in the form of the ego, adjudicates either by siding with the super-ego, buttressing it and thereby strengthening the moral inhibitions, or else by relaxing them so as to reduce conflict. The inference we draw is that the ego represents the true 'I' and it is this 'I' to which the neurotic refers when he says of himself that he cannot act. Whereas the id represents our common humanity, it is the ego which first enshrines individuality. The term 'ego' translated the German 'ich' and there is some indication that the standard English translation of this word did not please Freud. Thus the essential or 'thin' conception of the 'I' is identified with the ego. It is the ego to which the therapist addresses himself. His concern is for the ego and not for the id. The id, in contrast, has no concepts and can form no objects of its desires: any apparent cunning in the ways in which it tries to cir- cumvent the ego, through dreams or devious behaviour, is to be explained in terms of the fact that a straightforward onslaught is doomed to failure. However, the id remains an agent. It is purposeful; there is a teleological element in its pressure upon the ego and in the broad sense of 'I' the self acts in performing the neurotic rituals even if the essential I, the ego, is the unwilling victim of these forces. 16 See Rieff, ibid., 58-64. 495</page><page sequence="12">R. A. Sharpe We may recall Freud's own mechanistic analogy here. But the fact that the energy of the id takes the route available to it does not imply that the id is not an agent. In some of his early work Freud speaks in mechanistic terms, though, to be fair, it is not clear how much force should be attached to the analogy. In one respect however the analogy is required. It is implausible, as we have seen, to suppose that in sickness the ego is acting under duress. The ego no more acts than the man acts who is flung about bodily by external forces. So the sense in which the ego is unfree is not the sense in which our bank manager is unfree when he acts under threat but unfree in the sense in which a person who is bodily moved by other agents is unfree. But the intelligibility of this conception is by no means clear, and in examining it we focus upon a deep incoherence in the Freudian account. We have the notion of a person acted upon by external forces and unfree in that way (as opposed to being unfree in acting under duress) because we can see that person as a physical lump of matter subject to the laws and forces of the physical world. But the ego is not a lump of matter, so how can it be unfree in the same manner? All Freud offers are uncashed metaphors such as 'channelling'.17 To understand the loss of freedom involved we revert to understanding the processes in terms of physical movements and physical constraint. We are therefore thrown back upon the model of the early Project; if we conceive of the ego as corresponding to a part of the brain which is determined by events in those other parts of the brain which correspond to the super-ego or id then we have the glimmerings of an intelligible thesis. But, as I pointed out earlier, there is no way in which such a theory can account specifically for the loss of freedom of the neurotic whilst leaving the behaviour of the healthy and sane individual undetermined by physical causes. The model is a blunderbuss. The conclusion must be that a Freudian account is basically and irremediably flawed. Determinist or compatibilist, a Freudian has to make somewhere a distinction between those actions which are, at least apparently, free, and those which are, at least apparently, unfree. Freud's mature theory of personality structure can offer no answers.1 8 Saint David's University College, Lampeter 17 Three Essays on Sexuality, Pelican Freud Library, 7, 85. 18 An earlier draft, which was read at a University of Wales staff-student colloquium at Gregynog Hall in 1977, was also read by Professor Peter Alexander, for whose comments I am grateful. 496</page></plain_text>
