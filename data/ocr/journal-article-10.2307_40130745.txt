<plain_text><page sequence="1">Serge Koster. Le soleil ni la mort. Paris. Denoel. 1975. 245 pages (faulty pagination). 38 F. When a father dies, what happens to life? Serge Kos- ter, a young Parisian professor, cites La Rochefoucauld as a prelude to his first novel: "Le soleil ni la mort ne se peuvent regarder fixement." The Irish wake and the French repas de choix before an interment are il- lustrative. A central figure veers: fascination with death's trappings, life's erotic powers. Koster's novelistic sway is unique. From semi-orgasmic exaltation to atomic speculation, he dances in prose, often lurid. The je obtrudes. Francis Ponge's anthropomorphic poems, sad or rejoicing, insinuate a lyric/musical counter- point, even by distant suggestion. K. S. White</page></plain_text>
