<plain_text><page sequence="1">p THE HAJJ The Muslim Pilgrimage to Mecca and the Holy Places F. E. Peters Whhatever its outcome--spiritual enrichment, cultural exchange, financial gain or ruin-the road to Mecca w has long been an exhilarating human adventure. By collecting the first-hand accounts of travelers and shaping their experiences into a richly detailed narrative, F. E. Peters here provides an unparalleled literary history of the central ritual of Islam from its remote pre-Islamic origins to the end of the Hashimite Kingdom of the Hijaz in 1926. Peters has enhanced his presentation with an abundance of rare nineteenth-century photographs of pilgrims and the Islamic Holy Places from the unique collection of the Harvard Semitic Museum, annotated by the curator, Dr. Carney Gavin. "F.E. Peters has created an extraordinarily rich and de- tailed mosaic. I cannot imagine that we will ever have a more vivid portrait of Mecca. His anthology is unique and irreplaceable." -Stephen Humphreys, University of California, Santa Barbara Cloth: $29.95 ISBN 0-691-02120-1 MECCA A Literary History of the Muslim Holy Land F. E. Peters or the non-Muslim, Mecca is the most forbid- eden of Holy Cities-and yet, in many ways it is Sthe best known. Muslim historians and geogra- phers have studied it, and countless pilgrims and travelers-many of them European Christians in disguise-have left behind lively and well-publicized accounts of life in Mecca and its associated shrine- city of Medina. The stories of all these figures come together in this book to offer a remarkably revealing literary portrait of the city's traditions and life. "Full of informative detail, and with substan- tial notes and bibliography, [Peters'] work is a true scholar's guidebook to further study...." -Library Journal Cloth: $29.95 ISBN 0-691-03267-X</page><page sequence="2">S-HVCM A SJECVLVM THAT SHinE s n and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism Elliot R. Wolfson comprehensive treatment of visionary experience in some of the main texts of Jewish mysticism, this book eveals the overwhelmingly visual nature of religious experience in Jewish spirituality from antiquity through the late Middle Ages. Using phenomenological and critical histori- cal tools, Elliot Wolfson examines Jewish mystical texts from late antiquity, pre-kabbalistic sources from the tenth to the twelfth centuries, and twelfth- and thirteenth-century kabbalistic literature. His work demonstrates that the sense of sight assumes an epistemic priority in these writings, reflecting and building upon those scriptural passages that affirm the visual nature of revelatory experience. He shows how Jewish mystics pre- served the invisible transcendence of God without doing away with the visual dimension of belief. "The book is a dazzling accomplishment, a landmark study from one of our most gifted scholars." -Elliot Ginsburg, University of Michigan Cloth: $49.50 ISBN 0-691-07343-0 I i;!i': 4? i;? 1 New in paperback CRfEATION AND THE J'RSJST-ENCE OF EVIL The Jewish Drama of Divine Omnipotence Jon D. Levenson his paperback edition brings to a wide audience one of the most innovative and meaningful models of God for this post- Auschwitz era. In a thought-provoking return to the original Hebrew conception of God, which questions accepted conceptions of divine omnipotence, Jon Levenson defines God's authorship of the world as a consequence of his victory in his struggle with evil.

In this book the authors undertake to show how reli- gions in all parts of the world meet the needs of ordinary people and frequently have important consequences for individual reproduction and survival. Reynolds and Tanner show that religions have down-to-earth func- tions in the management of the main events of the human life cycle-birth, marriage, death, and the events in between.

What are the historical roots of modern Christian doc- trines, and what logical connections link them together? Now expanded to incorporate discussions of the sac- raments, the Church and the ministry, recent ecumenical movements and trends, and women's ordination, this concise introduction to Christian thought provides thorough, yet succinct, answers to these and other impor- tant questions.Avoiding a strict chronological approach, the author traces the development of each great issue that formed Christian theology. Questions of doctrine, such as the Trinityand the Incarnation, are dealt with in full, and the important issues in natural theology such as the existence of God, miracles, freedom of the will, and the problem of evil are also addressed. The text endeavors to show which issues in Christian thought constitute the "common denominators" of Christian belief, and traces the roots of Christian doctrine to their sources, explaining why certain doctrines were adopted and which are logically essential to Christianity.

However, these "domestic" values have been relatively ne- glected by Indologists, who have tended to view India and Hinduism through the prism of poverty, misery, asceticism, and themes of purityor pollution. Follow- ing recent scholarship by arguing that the earthlypur- suits are equallyvital to an understanding of popular Hinduism, Feldhaus examines the role of these ide- als in the religious meanings of rivers in Maharashtra, a large region of western India.

ESPOSITO, Georgetown University T his is the first comprehensive encyclopedia dedicated to the institu- tions, religion, politics, and culture in Muslim societies throughout the world. Placing particular emphasis on the 19th and 20th centuries, over 750 articles by a group of international scholars focus on the Islamic dimension of the Muslim experience in recent history. Background articles ground the information in its historical context and ensure continuity. Unlike more limited explorations of Islam, this work looks at Muslim societies in the Arab heartland as well as in South and Southeast Asia, and even in Europe and the Americas. Thus it offers extensive, comparative, and systematic analyses of Islamic beliefs, institutions, movements, prac- tices, and peoples on an international scale. Unique in its focus on the modern Islamic world, it is an invaluable ref- erence for anyone concerned with Islam: scholars and students, govern- ment and media analysts who increasingly require an understanding of the Muslim world, and interested lay readers who are becoming more and more familiar with Islamic politics and culture.

One is the broad sweep of the author's inquiry into the history of three concepts that are fundamental to the Great Goddess. She fol- lows a thread of continu- ity that has never been so crisply delineated. The result is kind of a concep- tual "adventure story" told in flashbacks: we know State University of New York Press c/o CUP Services * PO Box 6525 Ithaca, NY 14851 1-800-666-2211 (orders) what the mature concep- tion is, as it is now com- mon knowledge. Where it came from makes for very interesting reading. The second striking fea- ture is the provocative, suggestive linking of this history to contemporary issues regarding gender and women." - Thomas B.

CARMAN "In this valuable book Dr. Carman offers a careful and sensitive ac- count of ideas about God in Hinduism and Christianity, with comple- mentary views in Buddhism, Islam, and Judaism. It is a profound theological work that compares religious traditions in order to take seriously the challenge they represent." -Lamin Sanneh "From this study Christians will in an engaging way learn much about others' religious perceptions around the world on matters of central theological importance to us all. More significant yet, they will also learn much about themselves and gain a new, deepened appreciation of Christian issues.... A striking work."-.Wilfred Cantwell Smith ISBN 0-8028-0693-7 * Paper, $24.99 - - oo - omt-eI-t - -fo A-a - - -stan tu - At your bookstore, or call 800-253-7521 FAX 616-459-6540 4201 W. B.
