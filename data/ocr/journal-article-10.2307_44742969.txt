Fasanella PRC Kentron ABSTRACT On December 1 , 1 984 , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) con- ducted the first remotely-piloted air-to-ground crash test of a transport category aircraft. The Full-Scale Transport Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) was the culmination of four years of effort by the two agencies. NASA and the FAA had many objectives during the joint planning and conduct of the Controlled Impact Demonstration. NASA's interest was primarily structural crashworthiness • The FAA's primary interest was the demonstration of an antimisting fuel additive's performance. Demonstration of improved crashworthy design features was a secondary objective for the FAA. This paper is a report on the NASA experi- ments conducted during the CID. A portion of the preliminary structural loads data was released to the public at a Government/ Indus try CID Workshop held April 10, 1985, at Langley Research Center, Hampton, Virginia. ON DECEMBER 1 , 1984, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) conducted the first remotely-piloted air-to-ground crash test of a transport category aircraft. The Full- Scale Transport Controlled Impact Demonstration (CID) was the culmination of four years of effort by the two agencies. The FAA initiated the program for the purpose of testing an antimisting fuel additive which had been under development for years. NASA was invited to conduct crashworthiness experiments because of Langley Research Center's extensive experience in general aviation full- scale crash testing, crash data acquisition and analysis, crash photography, energy absorbing seat development, and finite element structural analysis. In addition, NASA was invited to Hampton, VA assume the responsibility for the developmental flight program and remote piloting of the un- manned vehicle to the impact site. NASA Ames Dryden Flight Research Facility at Edwards Air Force Base, California, has conducted many remotely piloted vehicle (RPV) tests in recent years, such as the recent testing of the Highly Maneuverable Aircraft Technology (HiMAT) vehicle. NASA and the FAA had many objectives during the joint planning and conduct of the Controlled Impact Demonstration. NASA's interest was primarily airframe structural loads measurements. The FAA's primary interest was the demonstration of the antimisting fuel addi- tive's performance. Demonstration of improved crashworthy design features, primarily seats, was a secondary objective for the FAA. Specifically, the CID objectives were : o Verify antimisting fuel (AMK) performance - (FAA) o Demonstrate operational AMR fuel/propulsion system capability - (FAA) o Acquire baseline structural crash dynamics data - (NASA) o Test improved crashworthy design features - (FAA). The NASA Ames Dryden Flight Research Facility developed the RPV control system and supporting simulator for the developmental manned flight program and for remote piloting the Boeing 720 aircraft to the impact site. Dryden developed a telemetry system for ground- based control of the aircraft and for recording the telemetered experimental data. Dryden also had the responsibility for systems integration. Dryden personnel integrated the FAA's AMR, fireworthiness, and crashworthy design features experiments, as well as NASA Langley Research Center's structural measurements experiment, associated electronics, on-board photographic system, and experimental seats. The NASA Langley Research Center was responsible for the selection, testing and installation of instrumentation for measuring 6.684 0096-736X/86/9406-0684$02.50 Copyright 1986 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">851885 the impact loads throughout the aircraft struc- ture» as well as for measuring the transmission of the loads into anthropomorphic dummies (seat performance)» a galley» and overhead bins« Langley developed» tested and qualified two independent 176-channel Data Acquisition Systems (DAS)» including hardware and software» for recording and transmitting aircraft impact loads« In addition» Langley developed a lo- carne ra photographic system to provide on-board high-speed film coverage during the controlled impact« Langley was also responsible for ac- quisition of the airframe structural response data» subsequent analysis of the airframe data» and development and validation of the aircraft mathematical structural model« This paper is a report on the NASA experi- ments conducted during the CID« A portion of the preliminary structural loads data was released to the public at a Government/ Indus try CID Workshop held April 10» 1985» at Langley Research Center» Hampton» Virginia« This paper presents the rationale behind the selection of the planned CID impact scenario» a description of the test article, the data gathering system used, the test, results from the NASA seat experiments, and concluding remarks« CID CRASH SCENARIO In 1980, as a prelude to the CID, NASA and the FAA initiated study contracts with the three major U.S. transport airframe manufacturers - Boeing Commercial Airplane Company, Lockheed- California Company, and McDonnell Douglas Corporation« The objectives of these study contracts were to review and evaluate all com- pany and government transport accident data; to define a range of survivable crash scenarios that could form the basis for improving crash- worthiness design technology; and to identify test techniques and analytical methods needed to evaluate impact dynamic response of transport aircraft« Between the years 1958 and 1979, 993 world- wide jet transport accidents occurred« From this total, 176 well-documented survivable accidents were selected for detailed evaluation. Generally, the three manufacturers examined accidents associated with their own aircraft, with the Venn diagram of figure 1 illustrating the degree of multiple review« This study effort provided definition of accident scenarios throughout the transport aircraft operational regime« The actual CID air-to-ground impact scenario evolved from this basis. After analyzing the accident data base, evaluating structural damage, and identifying injury causing mechanisms, three basic crash scenarios evolved: "Air-to-Surface, Hard Landing"; "Air-to-Surface, Flight Into Ob s truc t ion¿* ; and, "Surface-to-Surface, Overruns" (1) • Approximately 28 percent of the transport accidents occur during take off and climb and 54.5 percent during approach and landing. During these two phases, 85 percent of the operational time is airborne« Consequently, the most frequent accident scenario, an air-to- ground scenario, was selected for C ID . The "Air-to-Surface, Flight Into Obstruction" scenario considers those accidents in which an airplane encounters a hostile en- vironment off the runway at impact, such as during an undershoot« Because hazards and terrain conditions have a significant effect on structural damage and post-impact behavior, this scenario was eliminated in favor of the scenario with fewer ground variables - "Air-to-Surface, Hard Landing"« The "Air-to-Surface, Hard Landing" scenario considers those accident types in which the aircraft at a high sink rate impacts a level surface from the air, wheels up or down, and symmetric nose-up or -down attitude« This scenario is typical of a hard landing, approach, or takeoff accident. The planned CID scenario resulting from these detailed studies is depicted in figure 2« This scenario is representative of an "impact survivable" accident, that is, an accident in which the liveable volume is maintained and in which crash impact forces would be survivable for some of the passengers« The transport aircraft in the planned scenario would follow a 3 «3 to 4«0 degree glide slope in a 1.0 degree nose-up attitude« The aircraft would have a nominal 17 fps sink rate with no roll or yaw and a longitudinal velocity of approximately 150 knots« The planned impact conditions called for a symmetric impact for the crashworthiness experi- ments prior to encountering obstructions« The fuselage was planned to slide through a corridor between two rows of heavy steel wing-opening structures* These wing openers were designed to guarantee fuel spillage at 20 to 100 gallons per second« Powered frangible landing lights and a packed stone bed beyond the wing openers were to provide additional ignition sources for the fuel« Two jet-fueled flame generators were mounted in the tail cone to provide an onboard positive ignition source« The planned take off gross weight of the aircraft was 175 ,000 to 195,000 pounds« CID TEST AIRCRAFT The aircraft used in this demonstration was a Boeing 720, four-engine, intermediate range, jet transport originally owned by the FAA. This aircraft entered service in the mid -1 960 ' s • Even though the Boeing 720 is now considered obsolete, its structural design and construction are still representative of transport aircraft currently in use by domestic and foreign airlines« Because this paper deals with NASA's struc- * Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper« 6.685</page><page sequence="3">turai and seat experiments , the modifications to the aircraft for the AMK experiment are not described in detail* Suffice it to say that the fuel delivery system was extensively modified and that each engine carried a turbine-driven AMK /fuel degrader device* This device "degraded" the properties of the AMK so that the fuel characteristics were nearly those of Jet A fuel prior to entering each engine* Further information on this fuel delivery system exists in reference (2). The floor plan of the CID aircraft is presented in figure 3. Two sets of coordinates are used in the figure, both running fore to aft* The usual body station (B.S.) system is supplemented by an X-coordinate which is the distance in inches measured from the nose of the aircraft* Instrumentation hardware consists of two data acquisition system (DAS) pallets (one in the forward cabin and one aft), four power pallets (camera/lights) , eleven cameras, and associated lights* Experiments onboard included seats, galley, overhead bins, hazardous cargo, and flight recorders. There were 27 seat sets aboard for a total of 75 seat places (fig. 4). NASA had one row of experimental seats aboard at Body Station 1220* Of the 73 dummies placed onboard, only 17 were of anthropomorphic research quality with 13 instrumented. The remaining were CPR-type (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) dummies. The instrumented anthropomorphic dummies were lo- cated strategically to maximize coverage of the experimental seats* The two anthropomorphic dummies in the NASA triple seats (one each, center position) were tied, bent-over in a crash position* A total of 350 instruments were distributed throughout the fuselage structure, wings, storage bins, seats, and dummies, as shown in figure 5. The distribution was 45 percent on the seats and dummies versus 55 percent on the structure. The vast majority of transducers were accelerometers (305). The remaining 45 channels were strain gage-type transducers* The instrumentation layout of the aircraft is shown in figure 6. Basically, seven major frames spaced along the length of the fuselage were instrumented from belly to crown to measure load transmission during the impact (fig. 6a). The eros s -sectional views show the distribution at a particular frame. Eight bending bridges along the fuselage near these major frames were installed to obtain the variation of vertical bending moment during impact. The wing instrumentation (fig. 6b) was limited and primarily intended to measure verti- cal loads as transmitted along the spars. Both inboard pylons had two accelerometers at the engine connections (fig. 6c). These transducers measure the load transmission from the engines to the wings. Each wing had two strain gage bending bridges for measuring vertical bending moment • The NASA row of seats was located in the aft-end of the aircraft in anticipation of an aft-end primary impact. On the right-hand side of the aircraft at Body Station 1220, (see fig. 3), a standard Fairchild Burns Airest 2000 triple passenger seat jarried three dummies. A modified Airest 2000 seat was situated on the left-hand side opposite the aisle. NASA Langley researchers modified the Airest seat into a collapsible energy-ab s orbing seat (3). As shown in figure 7, several innovative design changes converted the standard triple passenger seat frame into a forward /downward collapsing four- bar linkage. Split sleeve and nylon bearings were installed at the leg/tube connections. Conventional aircraft bolts were employed as hingepins at the leg/floor rail attachment points. The four-bar linkage system provided the proper kinematics. Two graphite-epoxy , energy absorbing tubes, installed diagonally between the forward and rear seat legs, provided stability during normal flight and energy ab- sorption capability under crash conditions. The graphite-epoxy tubes progressively crush under axial load during aircraft impact if the loads exceed design levels. The schematic drawing in figure 8 il- lustrates the crash position of the center- seated anthropomorphic dummy and the seat/dummy/restraint system instrumentation. Both the standard and energy-absorbing NASA seats had similar center-seated instrumented dummies • CID DATA ACQUISITION SYSTEM NASA Langley Research Center developed the complete instrumentation/data acquisition system (fig. 9) for the CID crashworthiness experiments. The data acquisition system (DAS), as designed, included two independent systems each capable of collecting and processing data from 180 sensors. The signal conditioning units (used in the DAS) had 30 channels per unit. There were six of these systems in each DAS for a total of 180 channels of which 176 were used for data and the balance for system monitoring. The gain in the units ranged between 1 and 1000 with a full- scale output of 5 volts into the PCM (pulse code modulation) system. The PCM format for the data was set up in a frame format with 129 8-bit words per frame at a bit rate of 1 megabit. Within this format, 60 words were assigned to the 180 Hz sensors and 58 words were assigned to the 100/60 Hz sensors. The sampling rates for these data were: 1) 180 Hz data at 5.38 which is approximately 969 * Identification of commercial products and companies in this paper is used to adequately describe the energy absorbing seat design, testing, and performance. The identification of these commercial products does not constitute endorsement, expressed or implied, of such products by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration or the publishers of this paper. 6.686</page><page sequence="4">851885 frames per second; 2) 100 Hz data at 4*85, which is approximately 485 frames per second; and 3) 60 Hz data at 8.08, which is approximately 485 frames per second. The requisition time (due to synchronization loss) was three frames. (Potential data loss s 3 times 129 words) • The conversion of the sensor data in the PCM system was accomplished with a master con- verter which processed all data sequentially from the ÂMX (analog multiplexing) input cards in the PCM system. The data was then clocked out at the rate of approximately one megabit per second. The PCM data from each DÁS was trans- ferred directly to two onboard 14-channel tape recorders, then simultaneously through a delayed 262 msec memory (for initial shock) to each tape recorder in case of a single failure. The PCM data, while being recorded redundantly onboard, was also being transmitted redundantly air-to- surface via four telemetry transmitting systems to the ground receiver control station and mobile recording vans. CID FLIGHT With ideal weather conditions on December 1, 1984, the CID aircraft took off from Edwards ÁFB under the g round -based control of Fitzhugh Fulton, a highly experienced NÁSÂ test pilot. During descent to the impact site, a modified instrument landing system and an aircraft nose- mounted video camera for visual cues aided the pilot in guiding the aircraft to an extremely small impact footprint, 30 feet laterally and 200 feet longitudinally. At an altitude of 200 feet the aircraft was off the target centerline, but not enough for the pilot to call a go-around. The 150-foot level was the agreed-upon commit altitude be- cause of activation of time-critical, limited- duration, onboard photographic and data recording systems. At the 150-foot altitude the pilot made a fairly sharp left aileron control input to bring the aircraft back to the target centerline. This control input initiated a lateral oscillation problem after commitment, but prior to impact. The pilot concentrated his efforts on damping the oscillations, achieving the best line up possible with the target cen- terline, and meeting a critical project requirement of impacting the ground in front of the wing openers. The structural and seat experiments were planned for an impact and slide-out prior to contacting the artificial obstructions (wing openers) intended for the FAA AMK experiment. Impacting beyond the wing openers would have jeopardized the AMK experi- ment if fuel spillage had not occurred. Figure 10 is a sequence of photographs illustrating the CID impact. The aircraft's left outboard engine impacted the ground first with the aircraft rolled 13 degrees, yawed 13 degrees, and at nearly zero degree pitch (fig. 10a) • The aircraft was traveling at a speed of approximately 150 knots with a sink rate of 17 .3 ft/sec. The impact occurred 285 feet short of the planned impact area. The fuselage, pitching nose down after the left wing impact, struck the ground 0.5 second later at the forward cabin (fig. 10b) with a pitch of -2.5 degrees and a C.G. sink rate of 12 ft/sec. The wing absorbed a large portion of the kinetic energy and sig- nificantly reduced the severity of the fuselage impact. The aircraft continued to yaw during slideout and contacted the first wing opener at approximately 3 8 degrees left yaw (fig. 10c). This wing opener (3rd on right hand side of centerline) cut through the right inboard engine and diagonally slashed the leading edge and lower wing. The right wing failed, lifted upward as the aircraft continued to slide, and separated, dumping fuel during the process (fig. lOd) • All four wing openers on the right hand side cut open the fuselage, permitting fuel to enter the fuselage from the bottom. The ensuing fire took hours to extinguish, even though the Edwards AFB fire department was on the scene within 2 minutes of the impact. The time sequence of events during the first few seconds after impact is shown in figure 11 by a select set of vertical accelera- tion time histories. The time from initial left wing impact to the impact of the right-wing inboard engine with the wing cutter was nearly two seconds. Since the fuselage impact was nosedown, the nose to tail progression of struc- tural response can be seen from the pilot floor and B.S. 960 curves in figure 11. The major structural damage to the fuselage occurred at contact with the wing openers. This damage, however, is not pertinent to the NASA structural crashworthiness experiment. It was unfortunate that the aircraft fuselage did not slide through the corridor between the wing openers as planned. This fact along with the obliterating fire damage (fig. 12) made it difficult to correlate the initial fuselage impact data with corresponding final structural damage. RESULTS The overall performance of the NASA data acquisition and onboard photographic systems was excellent. Ninety-seven percent of the transducers were active at impact and all ten onboard cameras functioned properly. The data acquisition system and photographic system were enclosed in thermal insulation. The insulation prevented fire damage to all onboard recorded information, even though the fire lasted for a significant period of time and was hot enough to melt some of the aluminum airplane structure. The onboard film provided unique insight into the propagation of fire and smoke in the aircraft interior. The results presented here are from the impact and slide-out prior to contacting the wing -op ener s • This initial impact of the aircraft fuselage was the event of interest for the crashworthiness experiments. 6.687</page><page sequence="5">The distribution of impact-induced ac- celerations along the floor of the aircraft is presented in figure 13. The abscissa is the distance in inches measured from the nose (see fig. 3 for Body S t a t i on / x -c o o r d i n a t e equivalence). Acceleration levels are plotted along the ordinate in G units. The square symbol represents an acceleration peak read from the individual filtered time history. The plus (+) symbol represents a further refinement or "filtering" of the data. The "filtered" acceleration data point (+) corresponding to a particular time history is determined in this manner: The pulse duration corresponding to the primary impact is determined. Integration over this duration interval yields the change in velocity which, when divided by the duration, yields the average acceleration. Doubling the average acceleration to obtain the + data points is effectively a triangular ization of the actual acceleration pulse. Overall, the fuselage impact loads, as measured along the floor, were survivable using accepted criteria for human tolerance. The levels were substantially lower than anticipated because of the wing-nose-fuselage sequence of impacts. The peak vertical acceleration loads along the floor were highest in the cockpit and forward cabin near the nose wheelwell and were approximately 14 G's (fig* 13a). The remaining cabin floor received vertical acceleration peaks typically about 7 G's or less. The aft fuselage experienced levels below 4 G's. These levels were disappointingly low. Particularly, since the NASA energy absorbing seat in the aft end of the aircraft was designed to initiate stroking at 10 - 12 G's. The peak longitudinal acceleration levels showed a similar distribution with the highest level being 7 G's in the cockpit and forward cabin (fig. 13b). The levels were generally less than 4 G's over the rest of the floor. The lateral acceleration peaks on the floor were also generally low. They ranged from about 5 G's in the cockpit to 1 G in the aft fuselage (fig. 13c). Additional data have been included in figure 13 over that presented in reference (4) . Refinement of the previously presented data resulted in slight changes in correlation be- tween the acceleration peak (□) and "filtered" data (+) of figures 13a and 13b. A significant reduction in correlation occurred during refine- ment of the transverse floor acceleration data (figure 13c) as compared to reference (4). The previously presented results were not consis- tent, i.e., the transverse peaks corresponded to the left wing impact period of the time history which was nearly triangular. When the results were reexamined and compared for the the primary fuselage impact period, the correlation between acceleration peaks (□) and "filtered" data ( +) was not as good. The reason for this is, simply, that the transverse accelerations during the primary fuselage impact period were more oscillatory than triangular in nature. Generally, the peak averaging technique ( + points) produced good correlation with the peak data except at a few locations. Sharp spikes, producing high peak points, tend not to corre- late with the triangularization peak (+). The triangularized peaks ( +) are believed to be more significant from a structural and human response perspective. Histograms of preliminary results in figure 14 illustrate the structural response interac- tion and load path definition at various locations along the fuselage at primary impact. As discussed earlier, the loads were generally higher in the forward fuselage than in the aft section because of the nose-first impact of the fuselage. Locations B and C demonstrate that the load transmission through the fuselage section to the subfloor and dummies was sig- nificantly reduced by the crushing and energy absorption of the fuselage structure. At fuselage location B (Body Station 540), for example, the fuselage bottom experienced a sharp peak vertical acceleration of 32 G's and 0.04 sec. duration (fig. 15a). At the subfloor level this transmitted load was reduced by structural deformation to 6-7 G's with duration increased to 0.15 sec. (fig. 15b). The loads at floor level were essentially the same as the subfloor at this location (fig. 15c). The acceleration time histories (fig. 15d) from the seat and dummy's pelvis at this location shows that the higher frequencies have been filtered out by the seat cushion, pan, and soft dummy material, but that the level and duration was essentially unchanged. No seat dynamic load amplification occurred during load transmission to the dummy's pelvis at this location. The overall fuselage crush, as shown in figure 16, was determined after the test by measuring the distance from floor to ground on both sides of the fuselage. The left and right fuselage measurements were averaged and this subtracted from the pre-test floor-to-underbelly height to obtain global crush data. These data indicate 6 to 7 inches of crush in the forward cabin area at the point of con- tact near the nose wheelwell, 9 inches of crush forward of the wing, 5 inches over the wing and landing gear well, and 13 to 15 inches aft of the wing. The fact that the forward cabin did not contact the wing cutters gives some credence to those crush measurements, even though intense heat may have contributed to the deformation. However, the crush data aft of the wing is suspect because of the loss of structural in- tegrity after impact with the wing cutters and the intense heat. The NASA energy absorbing seat in the aft fuselage saw very low load levels and did not stroke. Figure 17a contains the vertical ac- celeration time histories of the energy absorbing seat and dummy's pelvis overlayed to illustrate these low acceleration levels and similarity of response, with the pelvis response (without amplification) lagging the seat impact, 6.688</page><page sequence="6">851885 as would be expected. The corresponding vertical time histories for the standard triple seat across the aisle from the NASA energy absorbing seat are presented in figure 17b. The performance results are comparable to the NASA energy ab- sorbing seat within the accuracy of the measuring equipment at this low load level. CONCLUDING REMARKS Even though the load levels measured in the CID were much lower than anticipated, the struc- tural loads experiment was very successful. The data will be useful in corroborating structural analysis computer programs being developed to simulate transport crashes. Ninety-seven per- cent of the data acquisition system channels were active, capturing a wealth of data still being studied and assessed by NASA and FAA researchers. The interior photography also captured, quite graphically, the crash behavior of the interior of the aircraft with all ten cameras functioning. The films are unique and contain significant information on fire propaga- tion and smoke obscuration. From an occupant human tolerance stand point, the CID primary impact loads were survivable. The impact with the wing openers and resultant fire were not assessed in this paper. A release of the preliminary CID structural loads data was made at the Government/ Indus try CID Workshop held April 10, 1985, at NASA Lang ley Research Center, Hampton, Va. The CID structural loads data are still being studied and assessed. REFERENCES 1. Thomson, R. G.; and Caiafa, C.: Structural Response of Transport Airplanes in Crash Situations.
