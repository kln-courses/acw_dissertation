Although some had favoured the move, others interpreted this as an attack on their lifeworld, with a number of herder-hunters choosing to remain in the forest where they reside in five campsites. This paper traces the development of the relocation from the perspective of three competing levels of experience: that of the national state, the regional government, and the Reindeer-Evenki themselves. Although the community represents the only reindeer-herding people in China, their experiences reveal insights into the nature of minority-state relations char acteristic of Northern and Inner Asia, including the contradictions associated with relocation. At the same time, as little research has been carried out amongst China's Evenki minority, I update the situation by providing material from a lesser-known ethnographic region. Keywords: Chinese Reindeer-Evenki, environmental resettlement, ethnic minorities, perspectivism, Inner Mongolia INTRODUCTION In 2003 the Chinese Reindeer-Evenki, a community of just over 230 individuals, were relocated 250 km to a purpose-built settlement on the fringes of Genhe City in China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This was justified on the grounds of environmental conservation in the Greater Xinggan Mountains' and the social development of an ethnic minority people (shaoshu minzu). Since then, the majority have remained permanently in the settlement, where they receive free housing, electricity and a monthly welfare payment of 190 yuan. Concurrently, between 30 and 40 individuals continue to live and work in the Xinggan taiga, practising mobile reindeer-pastoralism from five campsites,2 through which they procure and sell antler and other reindeer products.3 While Inner Asia 12 (2010): 317-45 © 2010 Global Oriental</page><page sequence="2">318 RICHARD FRASER some in the community had agreed to relocate, specifically those that had been separated from the reindeer economy at an earlier stage, the remainder largely opposed the decision and continue to maintain ties with the reindeer lifeworld, something problematised by their increased disengagement from the herding economy and the dissolution of subsistence-hunting. This paper traces the development of the relocation from the perspective of three competing levels of experience: that of the Chinese national state, the regional government, and the Reindeer-Evenki themselves. Through this, the relationship between sédentarisation and mobility is explored, including the interconnections between the forest-dwelling herders, their friends and families in the settlement, the regional government and the new tourism industry. THE CHINESE-EVENKI In China there are three groups that share the designation 'Evenki', the largest being the Solon-Evenki who number 25,000 and whose ancestors crossed the Amur, or Heilongjiang River, in the mid seventeenth century. Coming to settle in and around the townships of Hailar and Nantun, around half are today engaged in the animal husbandry industry, some of which is practised through mobile herding strategies and includes the use of Mongolian yurts. The second group consists of 5,000 people known as the Tungus-Evenki, who departed the Chita region of Russia around the beginning of the twentieth century. Like the Solons, they became pastoralists in eastern Inner Mongolia where the majority continue to reside and engage in animal husbandry. The Reindeer-Evenki, who are the focus of the present research, consist of 237 individuals referred to in Chinese sources as Yakut, specifically because they entered Chinese territory from Yakutia in Russia's Sakha Republic at the end of the twenties of the last century (Heyne 2002). Chinese authorities were unaware of this until the beginning of the twentieth century, when a delegation was sent to the Xinggan Mountains instructing the community either to return to Russia or to stop paying taxes to the Czar (Nentwig 2003). Like other peoples of the Russian North they had been in contact with the Russian state, both directly through forced tribute payment (yasak) and indirectly through the Russian Revolution, the Communist uprising and Siberian immigration (Forsyth 1994). Choosing to remain on the southern banks of the Amur River allowed the community to avoid such developments, with their encounter with the Chinese delegation proving to be their only major contact with the state until 1945. In 1958, following consultations with representatives from the three Evenki groups, the Chinese state amalgamated the Solon, Tungus and Yakut under the collective term Evenki (Ewenke [Chinese]). As in the case of Russia (Anderson 2000), however, such classification fails to capture the specificities of differing Evenki lifeworlds and although the Reindeer-Evenki identify themselves as eth nically related to the other Evenki groups, distinctions between the three continue</page><page sequence="3">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 319 to play an important role. For example, while the Solons have been influenced by the Mongolians living in Hulunbuir, signified by their adoption of the yurt and ability to speak the Mongolian language, the Reindeer-Evenki traditionally char acterise themselves as a community of hunters, more closely affiliated with the Oroqen who have been classified as a distinct ethnic group. The Reindeer-Evenki refer to two events in recounting their history with the Communist state; the collectivisation of 1967 and the reforms of 1984 (Beach 2003). Prior to collectivisation, the community's livelihood was derived from hunting, with reindeer used as pack animals and for subsistence milking. With collectivisation, this came to be managed under the auspices of a 'hunting pro duction brigade' (lieye shengchangdui), with the state acquiring a portion of the hunted pelts, furs and meat in exchange for production points, credits and, subse quently, monetary payment. By the 1960s, an analysis was made of the community's reindeer antlers, with the state, recognising their viability for tradi tional Chinese medicine,4 reorganising the hunting economy into a collective enterprise modelled on the Soviet sovkhoz [state farm] design. Here approxi mately 1,000 head of reindeer were collectivised, with the state purchasing the animals from the herders, providing them with a salary in return, collecting the harvested antler on an annual basis and marketing the product. Although a radical transformation, this ultimately proved agreeable for the Evenki5 them selves, specifically because reindeer remained under the care of their previous owners and they continued to engage in subsistence hunting and reside in taiga encampments. It was also at this time that the state sought to sedentarise the Evenki by con structing Aoluguya, a settlement which became the principal domain of the community and included wooden houses and an antler-processing factory. Although this was not the first time they had experienced forced settlement (Nentwig 2003: 4), the construction was undertaken with a hitherto unforeseen level of authority, with the new Communist administration actively integrating the community into its project of socialist modernisation and officially termi nating their Russian affiliation.6 Here the state erected a museum alongside the settlement to position the Evenki 'scientifically' along a scale of social and eco nomic development, seeking to justify sédentarisation through ideological means. Although widely recognised as instigating sédentarisation, the construction of Aoluguya was not wholly perceived in a negative light. Indeed, all of the people I spoke with stressed their gradual acceptance of the settlement, a place which remained peripheral to the nation-state and which people felt had become their home. This was also the case amongst the forest-dwelling herders, who recognised the old settlement as facilitating the reindeer economy, acting as a base from which to engage in subsistence hunting and maintaining the newly implemented antler industry. At the same time, the construction did result in an increasing number beginning to distance themselves from the hunting and herding economies, some finding employment in the forestry industry or the mil</page><page sequence="4">320 RICHARD FRASER itary, and a small but significant minority becoming members of the Chinese Communist Party. In 1984, the state reformed the antler industry and returned the reindeer to the 20 remaining herding families, seeking to increase profits through privatisation. This was reflective of the broader reforms taking place across Inner Mongolia, where the social engineering of the state was replaced by the current administra tive procedure of increasing autonomy within the domestic sphere of production (Sneath 2000). However, while the 'Household Responsibility System' was implemented throughout China, with pastoral households assigned ownership of domestic animals and use-rights to specific pastures (hetong), the Reindeer Evenki experienced a partial transformation, coming to reclaim ownership of their reindeer7 but not being granted use-rights to taiga pasture. Although they continued to engage in subsistence hunting, which was renamed a 'hunting enterprise' (lieye gongsi) in line with decollectivisation, the state came to prioritise the antler industry at the expense of hunting, with the enterprise taking responsibility for the processing and packaging of the antler in exchange for 20 per cent of the profits. This resulted in what Beach (2003) terms a 'dual-ownership system', with reindeer remaining in the hands of the Evenki while the antler crop was under full state control; 'A specific household head from each family signed a contract... with the newly established antler company, agreeing to care for the deer and to supply the entire antler crop to the company' (Beach 2003: 28). Coupled with this was the introduction of new infrastructural support, such as vehicles that provided transportation between the campsites and Aoluguya, as well as increased access to consumer goods and healthcare. Despite attempts at forced settlement, relocation and shifts brought about via collectivisation and reform, the economic and cultural base desired by the reindeer-herding Evenki was maintained; namely, the opportunity to live in taiga encampments, engage in subsistence hunting and carry out reindeer husbandry with an incentive towards economic gain. As had been forewarned, however, the future of the community remained uncertain, specifically as a result of their relo cation to a settlement on the fringes of Genhe City, accompanied by a state-imposed hunting ban and the confiscation of hunters' weapons. IN THE NAME OF CONSERVATION: THE REINDEER-EVENKI AND THE NATIONAL STATE In 2003 the state began its relocation of the Evenki, dismantling the village of Aoluguya and constructing a new settlement8 where the community were offered housing as compensation for relocating and accepting the newly implemented hunting ban. At the national level, the relocation has been characterised as a nec essary step in the environmental protection of Inner Mongolia, something visible in the national media which characterised the decision in terms of what the state calls 'environmental resettlement' (shengtaiyimin).</page><page sequence="5">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 321 The decision to move was made for recovering the environment and the develop ment of the tribe... In the wake of the 1998 deluge that ravaged the Yangtze River and rivers in northeast China a nationwide green-for-grain campaign has been launched. Meanwhile, steps have been taken to protect wild animals, especially the rare and endangered species (Xinhua 2003). Here, parallels are drawn between the relocation of the Evenki and the Yangtze River floodings, China's perennial environmental problem, with the state justi fying the decision in the name of national development and prosperity, what Flower describes in a comparable case as 'a local sacrifice for the greater national benefit'(2009:41). Since the advent of reform, the Chinese state has implemented a series of forced settlements and relocations, displacing and affecting the lives of millions of people nationwide (Flower &amp; Leonard 2002). Occurring alongside this has been the proliferation of policies of conservation, with the state further effecting relocations via the placing of a number of locales under official protection. The Greater Xinggan Mountains are a case in point, constituting China's largest forested zone and a primary site for the implementation of the Natural Forest Protection Programme {tianranlin baohu gongcheng). Over the past 40 years, the Mountains have provided 110 million cubic metres of commodity timber, gener ating 4.9 billion yuan (5 million euros) in revenue. As a result of increasing ecological instability, however, most notably in the form of forest-fires and demise of wild animal populations, the national state has designated protected areas (ziran baohuqu) where human habitation and logging have been restricted. At the national level, the relocation has been justified as a direct result of such policy transformations, with the Xinggan Mountains being redefined as an eco logical zone demanding state protection. Although the majority of relocations in China result in some degree of con flict, the case of the Evenki is distinct as a result of two interconnected factors. Firstly, the community comprises one of the smallest ethnic minorities in the country and, as a result, remains particularly susceptible to the top-down devel opment strategies of the state (Mackerras 2003). This is compounded by the fact that the Evenki engage in animal husbandry, a mode of production long consid ered 'backward' from the perspective of the Han-Chinese and modem Socialist state. As Qi Jingfu, former Minister of Agriculture, recently stated; 'It is the PRC's national policy to end the nomadic way of life for all herdsmen by the end of the century' (Xinhua 1998). Here the case is made further problematic by the fact that the community is the only minority engaged in reindeer husbandry and one of only two practising subsistence hunting,9 something that positions them at the bottom of the state's perceived hierarchy of social and economic development. The relocation must itself be situated within the broader national project of 'ecological construction', implemented in the western (Xi) provinces of the country which, as Yeh (2005) points out, is less of a geographical demarcation</page><page sequence="6">322 RICHARD FRASER and more of an ideological one.10 Ecological construction begins with an attempt to attract investment linked to the national and/or global economy (Yeh 2005), something which, in the case of the Evenki, began with the decollectivisation of the antler industry. As we shall come to see, this has been furthered by the initia tion of an Evenki-based tourism industry, which has received funding from the World Bank and technical support from a Finnish consultancy firm. The second feature involves the state investing in environmental protection, visible in the Natural Forest Protection Programme and in the state's earmarking 11.2 million yuan (1.2 million euros) to protect reindeer, 'expect(ing) to raise the population to more than 3,000 within 10 years from the current 700' (Xinhua 2003). In China, the implementation of conservation is undertaken via the corollary programme of 'ecological compensation' (shengtai xiaoyi buchang), involving, for example, the granting of new housing to those affected by relocation. In the case of the Evenki, this included the construction of an entire settlement, with the state providing material benefits to assure the community publicly that it is 'willing to make every effort to protect their traditional culture after they (have) settled' (China Daily 2003). Here, the designation of protected areas and allocation of compensation allows the state to present itself as a genuine agent, specifically distancing itself from the treatment of ethnic minorities and the environment characteristic of the Maoist era. This is misleading, however, because the implementation of such projects 'retain[s] a campaign-style mentality reminiscent of the Maoist era' (Economy 2004: 14), with conservation serving to justify development and forced relocation. This can be seen in the words of Wun Nanlan, former mayor of Genhe City: 'Their living methods resulted in a sharp decline of wild animals and environment degradation. Mushrooms and bryophyte on which reindeer feed have almost disappeared due to overgrazing. It will take 25 years to grow back to its original state' (China Daily 2003). Here scientific 'rationality' renders the herder-hunters accountable for their 'degradation-inducing practices', and, once achieved, they are then subjected to forced 'improvements' such as relocation (Yeh 2005). In this way, the state positions the local land users as wholly respon sible for the degradation of the taiga, deflecting attention away from its own role as facilitator of the timber industry and national industrialisation. The purported 'need' for conservation is, however, part of a larger quest: that of modernisation. The following ethnographic data will illustrate how the regional government is implicated in this process. IN THE NAME OF MODERNISATION: THE REINDEER-EVENKI AND THE REGIONAL GOVERNMENT Visiting the new Aoluguya in April 2009 I enter the office of Pu Lingsheng,11 a middle-aged Evenki man bom in the former settlement and now the mayor of Aoluguya. The office is situated in the centre of town and, like much of the new</page><page sequence="7">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 323 settlement, it is still under construction. 'This is my castle', he tells me while ges turing towards the window, 'From here I can see the whole settlement. There is the factory where the government processes the antler and there is the new hotel'. A broad grin stretches across his face: 'I guess this makes me the king'. Pu Lingsheng's father was one of the first Evenki to ask the government for support, requesting that they be given a settlement so as to modernise their way of life. He was one of the increasing number of community members who did not own reindeer and thus perceived himself to be at a disadvantage. The state responded by building the old Aoluguya, where, according to Pu Lingsheng, 'Life was difficult and we were poor', a characterisation not shared by all mem bers of the community. 'Now we have access to hospitals and schools. There will be a museum representing our culture and a hotel for tourism.' Aoluguya's mayor then shows me plans of the new settlement, presenting artist's renditions of tree-lined streets and chalet-style houses. The new settle ment now includes 40 such houses, as well as an antler-processing factory, a government building, a cultural museum, a hotel and various Evenki-inspired constructions from where traditional handicrafts are manufactured and sold. Each of the houses is divided into two halves, one for each family. There are two bedrooms in each half, as well as a kitchen, bathroom, and living room, with elec tricity and water freely provided (Figure 1 ). With the assistance of the Finnish consultancy firm, the intention has been to transform the settlement into the 'Aoluguya Ethnic Reindeer Resort', a mm HI J yam* &gt;: a; .^ftv:'&lt; / ■■ "•'■J ft ft'lftftl: -..1 fer- W £ESmm^m^' .', -: i . £#»' Yj m'MMM JUgi v, .,., FIGURE 1. House in the new Aoluguya. (Photo: author.)</page><page sequence="8">324 RICHARD FRASER residential-cum-tourism centre providing housing to the Evenki while simultane ously creating opportunities for tourism-related employment. Here the resort depicts the reindeer-herding lifestyle and history, featuring reproductions of tra ditional dwellings and posters of the community. Tourists are encouraged to stay in the resort and gain a sense of the cultural uniqueness of the 'reindeer-tribe', the settlement being akin to the model villages found throughout contemporary China (Gladney 2004), where 'traditional culture' is equated with tourism pres entation. In the new Aoluguya former hunters demonstrate 'how they used to live', sitting with tourists in the reconstructed dwellings and presenting activities such as crafting birch-bark storage containers and baking traditional bread. Across the street from the settlement is the 'forest-exhibit', featuring reproduc tions of traditional tents fixed into the earth and a small number of fenced reindeer grazing on a cleared patch of forest. The new Aoluguya is now situated 2.5 km west of Genhe City, where there are schools, commercial enterprises and a hospital. Its location is set amidst taiga forest but, as compared with its former locale, the settlement is urbanised, struc tured and integrated into the national transportation network. A statue of a golden reindeer has been placed at the highest peak overlooking the settlement, peering down at the hurried construction and marking this the home of a reindeer-herding community. Pu Lingsheng informs me that four million euros will be spent on the settle ment: 'With this we also hosted a meeting with some specialists from Norway.' The people he is referring to are representatives of the Association of World Reindeer Herders, an organisation into which China has recently been admitted. 'I also visited Norway myself and now Aoluguya will host the 2013 World Reindeer Herders Congress.' As we have seen, the national state presents itself as a genuine agent by ratio nalising the relocation in the name of conservation. At the regional level, however, this is subsumed under an explicit desire on the part of the regional gov ernment to modernise the Evenki and integrate them into the political and economic framework of the region, appropriating the 'reindeer-culture' of the community for regional self-promotion. This is visible in the tourism-orientated structure of the settlement and the state's utilisation of the Finnish consultancy firm, as well as the contradictory rationale behind the relocation itself. Indeed, while the national state had characterised both hunting and reindeer-pastoralism as detrimental to the environment, the latter continues to be practised in the same form as prior to relocation, despite the state having called for the domestication of reindeer as part of its conservation efforts: 'Reindeer raising will still be a major income for (Evenki) people, although they will be kept in stables instead of the traditional way of raising them in the wild' (China Daily 2003, my emphasis). When the relocation began in August 2003, hundreds of reindeer were trans ported by vehicles to newly constructed stables on the outskirts of the settlement. Soon after, however, many deaths were incurred as a result of inadequate condi tions and lack of lichens (Heyne 2007), forcing the herders to open the fenced</page><page sequence="9">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 325 enclosures and move their animals back to the forest. As one of my informants remarked; 'They wanted the reindeer to live in the city. Of course the living con ditions (for people) are better than those in the mountains but my reindeer will go hungry.' The persistence of taiga-based reindeer-pastoralism thus sheds light onto the fact that the regional government and, by implication, Pu Lingsheng, view the relocation not in terms of conservation but as an opportunity for modernisation and regional development, welcoming the funding allocated by the national state.12 Genhe, it must be noted, is a small forestry town with a population of 70,000; in terms of natural environment it is one of the most scenic in all China, with rivers and forests supporting an abundance of animal and plant life. The area, however, is not at all well known, with both local and international tourism remaining limited. As a result, the regional government is adamant in developing a tourism industry, something it seeks to achieve through the natural beauty of the Xinggan Mountains, as well as the 'unique culture' of the Reindeer-Evenki. This is articulated by Pu Lingsheng himself in describing his visit to the Sami reindeer-herders of northern Norway: 'They combine green tourism with the reindeer-culture of the people. Genhe is a good place to develop this here. I would like to make this a site for eco-tourism.' Here, the relocation emerges as a tactic in the development of the region's tourism industry, something visible in the newly constructed facilities and publi cation of an English-language advertisement outlining the government's intention to 'develop reindeer-culture-based tourism'. At the same time, the advertisement characterises Genhe as 'China's Reindeer City', despite the fact that the Evenki were, up until the time of the move, spatially separated from Genhe by 250 km. The advertisement also describes the 237 Evenki as com prising 154 'practising' reindeer-herders, something that is in sharp contrast to my own research, which has found the number to be not more than 40. Such a dis crepancy is significant as it highlights the regional government's desire to promote positively the image of (China's) 'reindeer people', a manipulation that is at least partly successful, given that Aoluguya will host the 2013 World Reindeer Herders Congress. Here, the regional government extends its authority that began with the con struction of the old settlement, in this case using tourism to compartmentalise further the different components of the Evenki lifeworld. While ethnic minori ties, according to such a view, should ideally reside in villages and be given modernised facilities, animals should either be left in the forest (where they can be hunted by tourists or high-ranking officials - see below) or in stables. In this regard, tourism emerges as the medium through which the state actualises its goal of modernisation, commodifying 'Evenki culture' so that it becomes suitable for public presentation (cf. Comaroff &amp; Comaroff 2009). This vision of modernisa tion, however, is not shared by all members of the community, nor is it experienced in equal terms. As one former hunter now living in Aoluguya told me while sitting in his newly constructed dwelling: 'While the government gave us</page><page sequence="10">326 RICHARD FRASER this (pointing at the light bulb hanging from the ceiling), they have taken away the forest and the animals too.' 'PERHAPS WE HAVE TELEVISIONS AND TELEPHONES, SO WHAT?': LIFE IN THE NEW AOLUGUYA Unlike Genhe, where, despite subarctic temperatures, residents readily go about their lives, frequent restaurants, and visit family and friends, Aoluguya gives the impression of an artificial settlement; there are no commercial enterprises dis tinct from the tourism industry and very little means for community interaction. As one relocated person commented, 'They put the golden reindeer in the moun tain to remind us that we are reindeer-herders. But all it reminds me is that we are separated from the forest.' It is important to note that a number of non-reindeer-herding Evenki had already moved to Genhe, specifically those that had lost their ties to the reindeer lifeworld at an earlier stage. These individuals have, on the whole, adapted well to the relocation, content with modernised housing and free electricity.13 The greatest impact, however, has been on those who maintain ties with the reindeer lifeworld, such as former hunters now living permanently in Aoluguya, as well as the family members of the current herders who do not reside in the forest camp sites, typically because they have children in regional schools. In the case of the latter, the relocation has demanded new strategies of coping, with increasing numbers of herders having to divide more of their time travelling between the settlement and taiga. One manifestation of this has been the setting-up of shops selling antler from individual houses, typically those of the herders who employ family members as salespersons. As we shall come to see, people increasingly make use of the settlement within the practice of reindeer-herding, specifically through the medium of kinship. At the same time, however, the families empha sise their ambivalence with the relocation, enjoying the material benefits but disliking the new settlement and their increased separation from the forest camp sites. Those who work as salespersons in the homes of their reindeer-herding kin also wait, I was told, up to two months for a new customer to arrive, an issue exacerbated in the case of former hunters who are now unemployed and dependent on government payments. As one person explained, 'All the herders are in the forest and in the town there are only old people, children, and former hunters, and they are all drinking and watching television.' A few days after settling into the home of one former hunter now living per manently in Aoluguya, one of my informants suggests one evening that we watch a DVD comprising scenes of Evenki hunting activities.14 As we gather around the television sharing bottles of beer, the old hunter watches attentively, commenting upon every action and singing along with the songs featured in the footage, nos talgia clouding his words as the new medium serves to objectify 'Evenki culture'. He speaks in the present tense, reflecting the contemporaneity of the relocation:</page><page sequence="11">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 327 'Look, this is how we track boar, we follow those markings. Yes, you see that boar, this is enough to feed us for one week. ' As the evening progresses people begin to grow tired, with a Han Chinese companion of mine complaining that we should all be getting some sleep. The old hunter turns to him and roars with anger; 'This is my culture! You do not know how to do these things! Can you catch a boar like that?! ' Glancing over in my direction he points at his face: 'You can see, I am an Evenki! [Referring to his high cheek-bones.] These are just Han, they do not understand!' The old hunter then spits on the floor as we laugh loudly, continuing to watch over another bottle of beer. Here, despite the pride felt by the old hunter in watching the footage, there emerges a sense of ambivalence, recognised too by one of my informants: 'He lives in the town but he wishes to be in the forest. He is always pinning for his days as a hunter. Now all he can do is drink every day.' The old hunter, when asked if he would prefer to have continued hunting in the forest, replied: 'Of course! We are from the forest. Here there is nothing for us.' Such moments occur throughout my time in Aoluguya and begin to capture the experiential implications of forced relocation. On another occasion, I meet an elderly Evenki woman, perpetually sewing an ornamental patchwork. Her father, she tells me, was a great hunter, and her mother, pointing at her needle work, 'did this'. 'Chinese development is taking place too fast', she remarks, expressing her dismay at cities such as Beijing. 'Over there the shaman's drum cannot travel into the sky', something she expresses in an embodied fashion by crunching the plastic table cloth upon which our food is placed together in her hands and emphasising its similarity to the urban setting. 'It is the same in the new settlement. The forest is too far away. There are no reindeer and no hunting. People no longer meet spirits because they are too far away from the forest. This is why he [pointing at one person who lives in Beijing] does not believe in them.' Here, the state's justifications, for relocation, conservation and modernisation respectively, are disregarded in favour of a personalised level of experience. Indeed, for many Evenki, like other peoples of Northern Asia, the world consists of various kinds of persons, only some of which are human, the remainder being non-human animals such as reindeer, as well as the intentionality attributed to specific trees and mountains. As Willerslev (2007: 186) remarks, 'it is not only spirits but all beings, including humans, that are understood in this relational way ... the person is not isolated and self-sufficient in the Cartesian sense of the cogito, but essentially and inherently relational, having no existence of his own outside or separate from the relationships in which he participates.' In this regard, the kinds of meaningful interaction considered paramount are co-dependent upon the forest-lived-space of the taiga, something alluded to in the old hunter's ambivalence towards living in the settlement, where 'there is nothing for us'. In this regard, what the relocated hunters and herders conceive as meaningful, from 'meeting spirits', 'having something to do' and 'interacting with reindeer', is intertwined with a proximity to the forest itself, a physical and existential</page><page sequence="12">328 RICHARD FRASER closeness that grounds local conceptualisations of personhood in the ongoing relationships between people and their environment. Here, Ingold'sphenomenology of dwelling provides an apt hermeneutic, for if the person is said to perceive his or her environment not as a passive recipient of stimuli, 'but as an active agent who purposefully specifies the meaningful prop erties of his or her surroundings' (Ingold 2000: 167), then in a context of relocation one's removal from those meaningful properties results in an existen tial dilemma, separating one from the things in life considered vital. This is what Austin-Broos (2009: 5) terms, in the context of aboriginal Australia, an ontolog ical shift: (Here) I have in mind Heidegger's idea that the very materiality of life ... is defined by particular acts, 'concernfiil dealings'. These dealings make both things and strategies 'ready-to-hand', with value that is taken for granted. In turn, this value is realised in practices that make discrimination between things and acts so that value occurs as 'regimes' or relational orders. When such orders are dis rupted, in this case by invasion and subsequent forms of change, things and strategies start to lose sense. Here, it is the lack of 'concernfiil dealings' that renders life in Aoluguya ambiva lent, a place which disables the things (forest, reindeer) and strategies (herding, hunting) considered meaningful. This explains why some relocated hunters con tinue to venture into the taiga, even if to collect berries; 'We are used to life in the forest, surrounded by reindeer. We are even used to the mosquitoes. Interaction with the forest is an indispensable part of life.' As Stammler (2005: 329) notes with regard to the Nenets of the Yamal Peninsula, 'It is through movement that the reindeer-herders define their position in the world ... and in order to lead a "real life", one has to be on the move.' Here it is the inverse that characterises the experience of the relocated hunters and herders: without access to the forest there is no movement and no interaction, one is no longer able to live a 'real' meaningful life. As one person commented at the time of the relocation, 'We can no longer sit on the ground and make bonfires. Opening the front door, we can no longer see the forest. Perhaps we have televi sions and telephones, so what?' (Xinhua 2003). This existential dislocation is visible in the context of alcohol consumption, a prominent domain of cultural embodiment throughout Inner Mongolia (Williams 2002). Drinking in Aoluguya, however, is of a different kind to that amongst the forest-dwelling Evenki, where, as we shall come to see, people make ritualised offerings every time a bottle is opened, indicated by dipping their finger into the liquor and flicking it three times, once towards the sky, once to the ground and once away from the body, an act reproduced also prior to eating. This is referred to locally as giving thanks to the sky, earth and hearth, and has been documented across Northern and Inner Asia (Humphrey 1996; Sneath 2000; Ziker 2002; Vitebsky 2005). In the new Aoluguya, however, veiy few people observed this, drinking greedily from their own bottles and often reaching a level of intoxica</page><page sequence="13">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 329 tion not seen in the campsites. Discussing this with one of my informants, he agreed that drinking had become more individualistic since the relocation, no longer seeking to appease non-human agents through offerings. Here the existen tial effects of relocation become visible through the relocated Evenki's lack of desire to perpetuate the relationships between human and non-human agencies, as well as their own physical embodiment through drunkenness. The ethnography of forced relocation remains a neglected theme in the anthropological literature; while some research has considered aspects of reloca tion,15 little of this has made its experiential effects a primary concern. This is the case, I argue, because forced relocation induces experiences that are not easily translated by normative anthropological theory, such as those of the relocated kin of the reindeer-herders and the recently settled former hunters. Here people apply ambivalent self-characterisations such as 'in-betweenness' and Toss' to capture their shifting existential moment, an apt comparison to the resettlement that accompanied the construction of Mexico's Zimapan Dam, where people experi enced pain and loss when their landscape, perceived as the source of belonging, was removed: 'As the natural and cultural landscape deteriorated before their eyes, many succumbed to mental and physical health problems, speaking of the dolor ("pain") of seeing their lifeworld "sacrificed" for light/electricity in other places' (Jackson 2005: 17). These feelings of loss, drunkenness and physical sickness are examples of what Bourdieu termed conatos, 'critical moments when the expectations that sustain people's habitus are no longer available, when our illusio - our interest and investment in life (is) shattered' (Jackson 2005: xxii). Although, as we shall come to see, some adjust to the transforming situation, finding employment, for example, in the presentation of 'Ethnic Culture' or developing strategies to cope with life between the taiga and settlement, for many their experiences remain undefined, emerging through specific events and encounters, such as watching the DVD or answering the anthropologist's ques tions. It is for this reason that I adopt a phenomenological perspective, attending to the ways in which change is grasped, experienced and (not) dealt with. The case of the relocated hunters and herders demands such an approach because many in the new Aoluguya are caught within the ebb-and-flow of the relocation itself, with negative implications emerging as experiential encounters between individuals and between people and public space (Jackson 2005). Here transformation is expressed contextually, in everyday experiences, comments and actions, from 'having nothing to do' and 'just watching television' to per petual inebriation and, on some occasions, murder and suicide. As Merleau-Ponty remarked, being human is not only a matter of 'I think' but ' I can' ( 1962:137). As Jackson adds, however, it is also frequently a matter of 'I cannot' : 'To be human is not only to have intentions and purposes, which one strives to consummate ... it is to be thwarted, conflicted and thrown by contingency and circumstance' (2005: xiii-xiv). Here in Aoluguya, the former reindeer-herders and hunters are just coming to terms with this realisation.</page><page sequence="14">330 RICHARD FRASER BETWEEN THE SETTLEMENT AND THE TAIGA: REINDEER PASTORALISM IN CONTEMPORARY CHINA There are 30-40 Evenki living and working in the Chinese taiga, herding clan owned16 reindeer and harvesting antler on an annual basis. This number fluctuates according to the seasons as well as personal preference, with many spending all of their time in the campsites and rarely visiting the settlement, while others visit periodically, primarily to purchase supplies, deliver the harvested antler and visit family and friends.17 There are five campsites currently operating, with the Evenki collectively owning 700-800 head of reindeer, a number that is perceived to be in need of augmentation.18 Camp 1 is the largest in China, situated in close proximity to the former settlement and consisting of 350 reindeer, owned by five families and with 15 people living permanently with the herd. It comprises some of the oldest members of the community, including the Evenki matriarch, Maliya, as well as her youngest son, Hexie, and daughter, Dekesha. Andao, another elderly genera tion Evenki, also lives in Camp 1 with his daughter, Gu Limei, her husband, Hou Shoulin (a Han Chinese), and their son. Camp 2 is located 180 km from Genhe and consists of 50 reindeer belonging to one family. Camp 3 is 90 km from Genhe and consists of 200 reindeer, with three families living permanently with the herd. Camp 4 grazes 40 km from the settlement and includes 80 reindeer herded by men of three families, whose wives and children live in Aoluguya. Camp 5 grazes 50 reindeer 30 km from Genhe, herded by one family. No slaughtering of reindeer takes place in any of the campsites and in 2009 wolves and lynx killed a total of 15 new-bom calves, problematising the banning of firearms from the per spective of the herders. Fifty kilometres north of Genhe, the paved road that leads out of the city turns into a dirt track, leading to the northernmost settlements of Alongshan and Mangui. The campsites are located within the taiga off smaller paths that diverge from this track, most near logging roads that cut through the forest. Although one is able to access these by foot, not all are open to vehicles, some thing which has implications with regards to hunting, which some Evenki continue to practise.19 Depending on the site, there are between two and six dwellings in an encamp ment, comprising two types of tent. The first is a larger, rectangular-shaped tent consisting of a birch-bark frame covered with canvas material. In the centre is a wood-burning stove, surrounded by benches used for sitting and sleeping, with a chimney protruding from the top of the dwelling (Figure 2). The second is a con ical tent, comparable to a North American tepee and known locally as a cuoluzhi. It consists of birch poles forming a conical hut covered with canvas material and birch-bark, and with an open fire in the centre (Figure 3). It was during the 1980s that the herders began to replace their tepee-tents with the new canvas dwellings, provided to them by the state as a means of increasing productivity. Able to house the wood-burning stove, they were happily adopted,</page><page sequence="15">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 331 BgSSa §0 FIGURE 2. Ridge-tent in campsite. (Photo: author.) FIGURE 3. Cuoluzhi in campsite. (Photo: author.) as the stoves maintained the level of warmth within the tent. At the same time, however, the stoves are extremely heavy and require motorised transportation between encampments. This reduces the mobility of the herders and limits the scale and frequency of their movements, something which has detrimental</page><page sequence="16">332 RICHARD FRASER effects on hunting and the grazing of reindeer, as well as making people more dependent on the township enterprise. Mobility continues to be seen as an essential feature of reindeer pastoralism with an encampment moved around four times per year. Having a number of 'favourite' locations to which they return, the herders often leave the birch-bark frames that support the tents standing once an encampment is moved, with all movements using government-supplied transportation. In winter, as pasture becomes more scarce, reindeer are left to venture deeper into the mountains and as snowfall reaches up to two metres in height, an encampment will not usually be moved at all. Occasionally, a group of men will travel in the vicinity of their animals, primarily to watch over the herds and engage in small-scale hunting. It is for this reason that spring is the most impor tant season, marking the return of the reindeer to the campsites and signifying the beginning of the antler-cropping season and birth of reindeer calves. As we have seen, the reform of the antler industry was not accompanied by the specification of designated grazing rights. As a result, it is the local forestry station (linchang) that oversees the movements of the herds to which the herders must report the whereabouts of their campsites. The absence of formal rights to pasture results in a high degree of uncertainty, with conflicts occurring when reindeer enter an area designated for conservation. This is further complicated by the fact that the herders, unlike all non-Evenki individuals, have special permis sion to cut timber for firewood and the construction of their dwellings, despite the forests remaining state property. Ownership of reindeer is structured according to clan affiliations, signified by tags attached to one ear of each animal. When a calf is bom it remains with its mother and thus becomes the property of the mother's owner. Even if the animals are in private ownership, however, the tasks of the pastoral enterprise are com munally practised, including the setting-up of a campsite, the sharing of firewood, alcohol, reindeer-harnesses and salt and, most notably, the cropping of antler. Discussions are made a few days before concerning which reindeer's antler are ready to be cut; a number of men will then tie the animal and position it on its side, two people holding the head and body while a third uses a metal saw to crop the antler. As it is removed large quantities of blood issue from the wound, which is collected and stored in bottles to be consumed as a beverage mixed with baiju,20 said to give the drinker immense strength. String is then used to control the bleeding while ash and leaves are rubbed over the wound to promote healing (Figure 4). Social relations between people and the environment are consistent with those described by Shirokogoroff (1929; 1935), Lindgren (1933), and Kajgorodov (1968);21 everyday life revolves around the relationship between people and their reindeer, with all tasks being geared towards some aspect of the husbandly enterprise. As in the past, such tasks are divided according to gender distinctions, with men taking charge of campsite construction, antler-cropping and, up until recently, subsistence hunting, while women spend their time</page><page sequence="17">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 333 «5§S FIGURE 4. Cropping the antler. (Photo: author.) cooking, milking and bringing salt to the reindeer, as well as ensuring that the smoke towers, used to deter biting insects, are kept alight (Figure 5). NON-HUMAN PERSONHOOD AND THE EXPERIENCE OF RELOCATION In order to understand their reluctance to relocate, it is imperative to note that the reindeer-herding Evenki characterised themselves, up until the time of the move, as hunters who used their reindeer as pack animals, supplemented with antler cropping and subsistence milking. This is consistent with the other reindeer-herding peoples of Inner Asia,22 who together comprise the southern most extreme of reindeer pastoralism. Unlike the large-scale reindeer ranchers of Scandinavia, northern Siberia, Alaska, and Canada, who live in tundra areas and raise large herds of reindeer for meat, these cultures practice a peculiar form of reindeer husbandry, raising small herds of deer in mountainous forest areas (taiga) predominantly as pack and riding ani mals and for their milk products, while wild game is the principal source of food. (Donahoe 2003: 12) This exemplifies what Stammler &amp; Beach term symbiotic domestication-, small-scale reindeer-pastoralism necessitating intimate human-reindeer rela tions (2006: 8). Indeed, the Reindeer-Evenki engage in a characteristic form of</page><page sequence="18">334 RICHARD FRASER FIGURE 5. Milking a doe. (Photo: author.) symbiotic domestication, providing lichen and salt to their animals while simul taneously working to deter biting insects. In return, reindeer explicitly seek human contact by returning to the campsites throughout the day without coer cion, something which necessitates an ontology of human and non-human personhood that mediates people's experience of relocation. As we have seen, for the Evenki the world consists of various kinds of per sons, with the taiga perceived as the proper domain from which to maintain relationships with such persons, ideally with the assistance of a shaman.23 As Heyne remarks (1999: 377), 'The Reindeer-Evenki are pure animists and believe that each thing has its soul. In their understanding, various spirits populate the whole universe', a characterisation that has already been documented (Shirokogoroff 1929; 1935; Kajgorodov 1968) and which positions the commu nity on apar with other indigenous peoples ofNorthern Asia.24 An apt example is when the herders open a bottle of alcohol and make a ritualised offering by dip ping their finger into the liquor and flicking it three times, paying respect to the sky, earth and hearth. Here the sky, earth and hearth are perceived as having their own modes of being, which specifically affect humans and require material con sideration. Connected to this, each clan is said to be watched over by a fire-spirit, permanently residing in the fire-stove of the tent. Prior to cooking or alcohol con sumption an offering, usually consisting of a glass of baiju, is thrown into the stove, and, in local parlance, 'feeding the fire'. On one occasion, I observed He Xie enter the tent in which I was staying and begin pouring himself a drink. As he was about to consume it, Gu Limei, the lady of the tent, reprimanded him,</page><page sequence="19">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 335 picking up her fire-poker and striking it against his leg; 'Do not drink until you pay respect to my home! ' Laughing, but realising his insensitivity, He Xie offered what everybody agreed was an excessive amount of alcohol into the fire. Another example concerns the herder's specifically perspectivist (Viveiros de Castro 1998) relationship to their reindeer. Indeed, peoples ofNorthern Asia have been noted to adopt the perspective of non-human animals: for example, with hunters, in recounting the story of the hunt, being said to do so from the perspec tive of the animal itself ( Willerslev 2007; Pedersen 2001). Although this was not identified amongst the Reindeer-Evenki, a comparable perspectivism did never theless emerge, specifically when observing the herders lead their reindeer back to the campsites at the beginning of spring. Reindeer, as we have seen, are left to venture far during winter and, being an ungulate species uniquely adapted to the taiga and tundra regions, are able to travel vast distances. As they are led back to the campsites the herders begin recounting intricate descriptions concerning how far the reindeer had travelled, what paths they took, whose animals travelled together and which ventured the furthest away. These would occupy people's attention for several days, with comments made such as 'Reindeer X chose to travel all the way to the valley', 'Reindeer Y found the path leading to the river', or 'Big Antler is always wishing to travel to the stream. He is looking for Liu Ba.' Such remarks reveal, in their embodied familiarity with reindeer-persons and forest-locales, not simply the manner in which the Evenki grant their animals agency, but the perspectivism alluded to above, with the herders emphasising the reindeer's own motivations from the perspective of the animals themselves. In this way, reindeer are granted 'an intentionality formally identical to human con sciousness, reflexive selfhood and social agency' (Viveiros de Castro 1998:467), an ontology that influences their avoidance of relocation. As Habeck remarks (2006: 133), 'The statement that a draught reindeer "lis tens well" and "obeys well" is an illustration of the animal's sensual perception and its rapport with the sledge driver. By doing so, a draught reindeer attains per sonhood.' While the characterisation that an animal 'listens well' or, in the case of the Evenki, 'travels far' appears anthropomorphic, this is to misapprehend the ontological presuppositions of an animic lifeworld (Descola 1992). Indeed, from the perspective of the Evenki and other northern indigenous peoples, an animal that 'listens well' and 'travels far' is not like a human person, but rather is a person like a human being, something seen in the aforementioned examples of the herders attributing to their reindeer capabilities typically reserved for the human species. Here human-reindeer relations are envisaged as a 'confrontation with the natural as well as the social environment' (Bird-David 1999:132), some thing evident in the herders' characterisation of their reindeer as possessing their own unique personalities. When the antler-cropping season comes around, for example, reindeer are said to know at which time the cutting will begin, with the would-be target purposely remaining at the margins of the campsite. When the cropping does get under way the herders act especially sympathetically to the reindeer involved, speaking to them in highly personalised terms: 'For us</page><page sequence="20">336 RICHARD FRASER reindeer are our children. When we cut their antler we always speak to them as our children, calling them by name.' Here, it is arguable that the 'new' antler industry has been incorporated into the community's ontology of the environment. Indeed, while in the past, hunting provided a suitable medium for the articulation of perspectivist relations, the cur rent reindeer-herders envisage antler-cropping (and reindeer more generally) as the primary 'reason' for being in the forest, particularly vis-à-vis the hunting ban. As a result, it is through antler-cropping that the herders maintain the web of rec iprocity in which they perceive themselves, taking the antler from the reindeer and, in return, providing for them the necessary sustenance in the form of wild lichens. In this way, antler-cropping fulfils the maintenance of generalised reci procity characteristic of northern hunters (Nadasdy 2007: 27), as well as perpetuating the symbiotic domestication discussed at the onset. As one herder remarked, 'If I am not here, who will look after the reindeer?', a comment that reveals an ontology in which human and animal persons coexist in a reciprocal relationship, 'not only for their movements in the landscape, but also for their sustenance and reproduction, their life and death' (Stammler &amp; Beach 2006: 12) (Figure 6). As such examples demonstrate, Evenki personhood is maintained through the relationships between human and non-human persons, specifically via the exchange of antler, lichen, salt and blood. This explains why the herders choose to remain in the forest campsites, a place which allows them to perpetuate such relations, as well as the ontological shift amongst the relocated, who are no longer part of this person-based network. FIGURE 6. The herd takes a rest. (Photo: author.)</page><page sequence="21">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 337 As Ingold remarks ( 1991: 16), 'It is through dwelling in a landscape, through the incorporation of its features into a pattern of everyday activities, that it becomes home to hunters and gatherers' (my emphasis). Similarly, in the case of the Evenki the ontology of non-human personhood extends beyond non-human animals to 'the environment' as well. Thus, travelling through the taiga the herders regularly associate forest locales with past actions, persons and encoun ters, with the taiga and certain sacred mountains experienced as actors in a field of non-human sociality. Here, it is the taiga that is home to the Reindeer-Evenki, who have incorporated the practices of reindeer-pastoralism, hunting and antler cropping into their everyday lived experience. This is in contrast to the new Aoluguya, where the lack of relationships and memories results in the de personalisation of the settlement, something that explains people's preference for remaining in the campsites and, as we shall now see, their conflicting relationship with the regional government. 'LIFE WITHOUT REINDEER IS LIKE LIFE WITHOUT RICE FOR THE HAN' Evenings in the campsites are spent preparing food, eating and drinking, typi cally each family separately. My presence, however, facilitated larger meals which, along with the chance to engage in heavy drinking, afforded the herders the opportunity to, in their own words, 'tell me the truth about their situation'. Hunting is our real life. When we were in (the old) Aoluguya we could hunt freely and made a lot of money. Now there is no hunting and life is difficult. The antler gives us a very small amount of income. This means we are dependent on a small amount of reindeer and they become weaker every year. (He Xie) Here, it is the demise of hunting that emerges as the dominant source of tension between the state and the herders, with the antler industry perceived as a supple mentary activity. Each family continues to own one rifle, which the regional government allows for protection against predators. The contradiction, however, is that the herders are not allowed to hunt predators if encountered, specifically because they remain protected species. This is further made problematic by the fact that the herders regularly encounter illegal hunters in the taiga, typically poachers and, more controversially, government officials. When meeting Pu Lingsheng I failed to obtain adequate information con cerning the antler industry, specifically because of an ambivalent moment that occurred whilst interviewing him. He told me that each spring the antler are cropped, then delivered to the new settlement where they are processed by the township enterprise. "The next step', Pu Lingsheng remarked, 'is we throw them away' (women ba ta reng le), laughing and speaking no further about the situa tion. Although intended as a joke, Pu Lingsheng's comments bring to the fore the contradictions associated with the antler-industry. As He Xie tells me:</page><page sequence="22">338 RICHARD FRASER We cut the antler once a year and deliver it to the settlement. Then it is processed and packaged in the factory. The antler is then returned to us for sale, which we do from our shops. The government also takes a portion for itself and sells it sepa rately. We are told that because it is an open market, each family can sell his antler at whatever price, but it is difficult because there are 10 shops and the government also sells. We do not know how much the government takes and we know that it is possible to buy antler in Beijing which comes from Russia. Beach (2003) found that in 1997 the Evenki maintained ownership of their rein deer while the antler crop was under full state control, with the former cooperative selling all of the antler and passing on 80 per cent of the profits to the herders. My findings suggest that, although the antler is still processed and mar keted by the state in the form of a production unit (which charges a fee), and the proceeds from sales go to the herders,25 the latter also maintain shops in their new homes from where antler is sold privately to visiting customers. As described above, there is therefore a mixed collective-private dimension to today's antler economy, with private sales complementing those of the production unit. This suggests that antler ownership has been at least partly transferred to the Evenki since relocation, resulting in an increasingly marketised industry and diminishing the 'dual-ownership system'. At the same time, however, this does not imply full privatisation, since the township enterprise technically holds a monopoly on the reindeer economy, something further problematised by the ongoing debate sur rounding reindeer ownership. As could be seen in Pu Lingsheng's remarks, which were reproduced by officials I spoke with in Genhe, the regional govern ment does not view the antler industry as an important source of income, placing greater emphasis on ethnic-based tourism which is perceived to be the 'future' of the community. Each herding family is, in this regard, in direct competition with one another, despite practising communal-style herding. At the same time, they are in compe tition with the state itself, which sells its own portion of the antler through a state-affiliated company. Here the 'free market' renders competition unbalanced, with the herders selling their antler from individual shops, thus relying on clients travelling to Aoluguya, while the state company, through its increased access to technology, operates a website facilitating national delivery. I ask Hou Shoulin to describe the government-support that is provided and his response is brisk: 'They spend all the money on the settlement and send us a car once a month, but it is not enough. ' Another herder interjects: ' When the car comes they bring us only limited supplies, maybe vegetables. But we must pay for oil, alcohol, rice, medicine, and school supplies.' In this regard, the relationship between the herders and the state is contrary to the government leader's character isation: support is provided but it is of a limited kind, particularly in comparison with the funding allocated to the new Aoluguya. The welfare allowance of 190 yuan26 is considered a meagre contribution from the perspective of the herders, all of whom must rely on settlement-based kin outside the reindeer economy.</page><page sequence="23">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 339 I also learn that the herders dislike the regional government leader, despite their tentative support for the central government: 'The state gives a lot of money to minorities, but who knows what happens before it gets to us? Pu Lingsheng is not a reindeer-herder. He does not understand our way of life. ' This is made prob lematic by the fact that Pu Lingsheng has himself been granted a position in the Association of World Reindeer Herders, and is described there as an 'Evenki reindeer-herder'. Undoubtedly, his position serves to facilitate the material benefits granted since relocation, as well as drawing attention to the Chinese Evenki through the Association of World Reindeer Herders. At the same time, however, there exists a stratification between him, the relocated Evenki and the reindeer-herders, with the latter emphasising their absence from the macro decision-making affecting the community. Despite such restrictions, the reindeer-herders are passionate about the value of their lifeworld: 'Of course life is harder in the forest, but it is the place where our culture survives. This is why we withstand the hardships. This is why we keep on living here! It is nice to have a house and I am happy my son can stay there after school, but the settlement is like a zoo! ' 'Yes, I agree', Gu Limei inter rupts. 'Life is not the same there. I can never stay for too long. There is nothing to do, there are no animals, no reindeer. I cannot live in a place like that.' (Figure 7). I have already commented on the intimacy between the Evenki and their rein deer, as well as the ontology of relations between human and non-human persons characteristic of Inner Asian reindeer-herders. This intimacy is what captures the divergence between life as it is experienced in Aoluguya and that in the forest campsites, explaining why my reindeer-herding informants dislike the new FIGURE 7. Liu Xia and a young calf. (Photo: author.)</page><page sequence="24">340 RICHARD FRASER settlement, why the settled hunters experience existential dislocation and why tensions have emerged between the herders and the regional government. This takes on an even greater significance when the herders begin their nightly rendi tion of song, embodying their relationship to the forest and their reindeer by singing about their life and its dissimilarity to Aoluguya: I sing about my love for the forest and my reindeer, How can I sing such songs when I cannot see the stars? We may not see cars and trains, But we are happy because the forest is our home, For us, life without reindeer is like life without rice for the Han. [Song lyrics] CONCLUSION It has been my aim, in this paper, to provide an ethnographic update on the Chinese Reindeer-Evenki, describing the relocation from the perspective of three competing levels of experience: the state, the regional power-holders and the inflicted community. Studies of Northern and Inner Asia (Humphrey &amp; Sneath 1999; Habeck 2005; Stammler 2005) have shown that sédentarisation and mobility are not mutually exclusive, with mobile pastoralism remaining compat ible with more sedentary modes of dwelling. In the case of the Evenki this is true to a certain extent, with the relationship between the herders, the settlement and the regional government providing the basis for the perpetuation of the reindeer lifeworld. At the same time, however, my findings suggest that this is not the result of a sustainable economic arrangement, such as a viable antler industry. Despite pro viding benefits to those relocated, as well as limited support to the reindeer-herders, the regional government does not take seriously the antler industry, the herder's primary source of income and last remaining feature of the reindeer lifeworld. At the same time, it does little to make the reindeer economy appear attractive in the eyes of Evenki youth, with only a handful of young people expected to continue practising reindeer-herding. Although many in the community have found it difficult to adjust to the tran sition, there are those who seek new sources of livelihood; for example, one family has set up a website from their house facilitating delivery of the antler product, capitalising upon the settlement's access to technology. At the same time, new strategies are emerging which seek to mediate the taiga-settlement divide, creating new modes of relation which will demand further attention in the future. To illustrate this, on one occasion I travelled with a group of herders to the settlement, driving for four hours. Upon arrival, one met his brother at his newly constructed house and delivered the harvested antler and another visited his wife and son who reside permanently in the settlement, where he 'rested' and acquired</page><page sequence="25">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 341 supplies. A third herder 'went home' after having spent four months in the taiga, replaced with a new herder (his brother) who travelled back to the campsite. Here, new linkages between the settlement and taiga allow people to arrange strategies in line with reform and the availability of state-supplied transportation, taking advantage of their new dwellings to rest, store supplies or house their fam ilies. In this regard, despite an increasing number having to divide more of their time between the settlement and the taiga, this is not to suggest a uniform pattern of sédentarisation. Instead, the settlement serves to facilitate the reindeer lifeworld alongside sédentarisation, enabling people to move from one location to another depending on the season or the number of herders currently in the campsites, as well as personal preference. Of course, it would be misleading to present flexibility in over-simplistic terms; as we have seen, there are those who perceive the taiga-settlement divide as insurmountable, almost never visiting the settlement and staying in the campsites for over 300 days a year.27 For these indi viduals, relocation was a threat to the taiga-based lifeworld, a variation which demands a subtle approach able to consider the ways in which some herders develop strategies between the taiga and settlement, as well as the specific demands of those less accustomed to life outside the forest. According to the regional government, the 'Aoluguya Ethnic Reindeer Resort' will provide new employment opportunities in the form of hotel jobs, souvenir production and ' Evenki home-stays '. With the assistance of the consul tancy firm, the intention is to preserve the cultural heritage of the community by turning the 'old' skills and lifestyle into a tourism product (Poyry 2008: 7). The question, however, is how viable these skills and lifestyle will be as a tourism product, how the presentation of 'traditional culture' will be managed and what implications this will have on the reindeer lifeworld outside the resort and in the taiga.28 Thus far, failure on the part of the state to designate grazing rights has only destabilised the reindeer economy, creating a situation of uncertainty with regard to state privatisation. Here, it is arguable that relocation has set the conditions for a dependency on government assistance and tourism, the latter providing employment in the form of hotel jobs and souvenir production but transforming the Evenki lifeworld into a tourism product itself, not necessarily perpetuating a taiga-based lifeworld. China's entry into the Association of World Reindeer Herders has been char acterised as a step towards the development of a sustainable reindeer-herding enterprise. As pointed out by my informants, however, this will only be the case if the government recognises the demands and specificities of the reindeer-herding lifeworld (including the value people attach to subsistence hunting and taiga based residence) and if future-generation Evenki are granted legal rights to, and provided with skills for, reindeer-husbandry.</page><page sequence="26">342 RICHARD FRASER ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS Fieldwork amongst the Reindeer-Evenki was undertaken in the winter of 2008 and the spring of2009.1 thank all my Evenki and Oroqen friends who hosted me during this time and generously shared their knowledge, skills, and lives. I would also like to thank Bai Ying of the Minzu University, Beijing, for facilitating all introductions; Skyler, for all of his assistance; and Hing Chao of the Orochen Foundation. Finally, I thank two anonymous reviewers from Inner Asia for their insightful comments and advice. NOTES 1 The Xinggan Mountains are in the northeastern part of China. Extending 1200 km, they divide the Manchurian Plain from the Mongolian Plateau and are the homeland of China's northeastern minorities, including the Evenki, Oroqen, Daur, and Hezhen. 2 At the time of publication I leamt of the creation of a sixth campsite, emerging from a split within Camp 1. 3 This includes dried reindeer placenta and penis. 4 Reindeer antlers grow throughout the year and are cut before any bone substance has formed. Consisting of high quantities of rantarine, said to increase the immune system and build masculine virility, they are highly prized by Asian clients. If antlers are not cut they will shed naturally but are less potent and hence diminish in value. 5 From now on, 'Evenki' refers to the Reindeer-Evenki unless otherwise specified. 6 This included the prioritisation of the Chinese language over Russian and the expecta tion that the community accept China as their official homeland. 7 The ownership of reindeer remains a debated issue. While the herders consider the ani mals theirs, some township officials state that all reindeer continue to belong to the township government. 8 Although argued as a matter of convenience, in keeping the name of the former Aoluguya the radical nature of the relocation is diminished. 9 The other being the Oroqen. 10 According to Yeh, the 'west' includes Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Qinghai provinces, as well as the autonomous regions of Tibet, Ningxia, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Guangxi. 'Thus defined, "the west" is home to about three-quarters of China's ethnic minority population' (Yeh 2005:10). 11 The names of some informants have been changed. 12 The national state acquired the funds for the resettlement/sedentarisation from a source specifically for cases of'ecological migration' (shengtai yimin). 13 In 2009 Aoluguya consisted of sixty-two households, twenty of which had government employment, twenty-four worked within the reindeer economy and three had members working for external companies. 14 This film was produced by the Minority Nationalities University in Beijing, with footage from the 1980s. 15 This includes the rise of alcohol-abuse amongst hunter-gatherers (McKnight 2002) and the relationship between conservation, forced settlement and mobile indigenous people (Chatty &amp; Colchester 2002).</page><page sequence="27">FORCED RELOCATION AMONGST THE REINDEER-EVENKI 343 16 In 1949 the Reindeer-Evenki comprised six clans. Today there are five (Heyne 1999). Clan organisation plays a fundamental role within the campsites, with each camp named after the current head of the clan. The clan-heads are considered the most respected mem bers of the community and informed of all decisions, including the movement of encampments and visits to Aoluguya. 17 Unlike in the Russian north (Habeck 2005), where state- and company-managed herding designates work-shifts for reindeer-herders, creating seasonal linkages between the tundra and village, it is a matter of personal preference how long the Chinese-Evenki spend in the taiga. Some almost never travel to Aoluguya while others, particularly younger herders or those with wives and children in the settlement, visit on a monthly basis. 18 For comparative purposes, the Tsaatan reindeer-herders of northern Mongolia number 300 and own 500 reindeer, while the Tozhu-Tuvans of the Republic of Tuva number 300 and own just over 400 reindeer. 19 This is done in secret, usually at night, and can result in incarceration. 20 Baijiu literally means 'white spirit' and is a distilled liquor, 40-60 per cent alcohol by volume. It is drunk on a daily basis. 21 The works of Shirokogoroff, Kajgorodov and Lindgren must be situated in the context of their production. Shirokogoroff's work, in particular, avoided consideration of the impact of Russian history on the Evenki. All remarks concerning the specificities of the human-reindeer relationship, however, remain apt. 22 This includes the Soyot of Buiyatia, the Tofalar of Irkutsk Oblast, the Tozhu-Tuvans of the Republic of Tuva and the Tsaatan of northern Mongolia. 23 The last Reindeer-Evenki shaman (female) died in 1998. For a discussion of shamanism amongst the community, see Heyne (1999). 24 For example, their Evenki and Eveny counterparts in Siberia (Vitebsky 2005; Anderson 2000), the Nenets of the Yamal Peninsula (Stammler 2005), the Yukaghir of Yakutia (Willerslev 2007), as well as the Saami (Ingold 1980), the Cree and Ojibwa of northern Canada (Feit 1973; Hallowell 1960) and members of the Kluane First Nation (Nadasdy 2007). 25 The continuing involvement of the production unit is an issue of contention for the herders. Once the antler is processed and sold the herders wait for up to one year before they can collect the proceeds from the sales, hence their desire to maintain private shops. 26 This is distributed by the Bureau of Civil Affairs (minjian ju). 27 Here, flexibility is a matter of existential and skilled competence, with new contexts demanding the embodiment of practical knowledge through socialisation and practice that is re-grown (Ingold 2000:5). This is the basis for my future research amongst the commu nity. 28 It has been suggested that one use of such cultural resources would be to establish a 'hunting park'. However, it was the protection of wildlife which was the primaiy reason for the resettlement, with great criticism having been levelled against the hunting ban. As a result, it would be highly problematic if hunting was allowed to be practised as a tourism product while the community had to forego what they perceived to be their centuries-old way of life.</page><page sequence="28">344 RICHARD FRASER REFERENCES Anderson, D. 2000.
