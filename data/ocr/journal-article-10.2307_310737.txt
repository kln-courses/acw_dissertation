<plain_text><page sequence="1">PARMENIDES AND HESIOD BY EDWIN F. DOLIN, JR. P ARMENIDES' poem sometimes seems to evoke the same fascina- tion and sense of borrowed glory as his wandering moon, shining with a light not its own (B.I4): VVKTrcpaE TEpl yaitav acAt[Evov AAd'rptov -6S The assurance and calm with which the poem offers this and other examples of disquieting imagery, particularly in the "proem," has stimulated a search for sources and prototypes, whether in mystery religion or in Hellenic myth, legend, and poetry. It should be said at once, of course, that the power and brilliance are Parmenides' own and not borrowed from anyone. To assume, as this paper does, that the tradition from which Parmenides drew was the main poetic tradition of Homer and Hesiod is not to imply that hexameter poetry by itself somehow accounts for Parmenides. Rather, the assumption is that the tradition was there, pervasively and ineluct- ably, in the cultural atmosphere, that Parmenides used its motifs and imagery as freely and naturally as he breathed, counting them as allies in his poetic communication with Hellas, and that he criticized this cultural donnee whenever he saw fit, which was not seldom, by the very manner in which he made use of what he liked of it. The prototypal aspect of Homer in Parmenides, especially of the Odyssey, has been discussed by E. H. Havelock.' Odysseus, the ex- perienced and knowing traveler protected by the goddess Athena, reaches an ultimate place where day and night meet and where he is told by Circe, goddess and daughter of the sun, what road to take home. In another ultimate place, Thrinacia, he finds the immortal cattle of Helios, the sun, guarded by the sun's daughters. Telemachus, Odysseus' son, makes a chariot journey in search of his father. And, in the Iliad, Achilles' famous chariot horses are immortal and wise. So, in Parmenides' poem, the narrator is a knowing man (E$W' qWs) on a journey to an ultimate place where day and night meet and where he is told what road to take. His chariot is drawn by wise, immortal horses. His guides are goddesses, daughters of the sun. The Homeric parallels and language, Professor Havelock remarked, suggest that</page><page sequence="2">94 Edwin F. Dolin, Jr. the experience of Parmenides is to be viewed as a new form of traditional epic heroism. Hesiodic parallels, on the other hand, have been remarked by Werner Jaeger, among others. Jaeger, in fact, suggested that the Greeks saw "in Parmenides' adoption of the verse-form of his venerable theological predecessor an avowed intention to compete with him on his own territory... Parmenides present(ed) himself as one who had followed in Hesiod's footsteps and beaten him at his own game."2 This article seeks to extend the comparison with the Theogony by suggesting a specific parallel between Parmenides' daughters of the sun and the Theogony's Muses and by commenting on the parallel between Parmenides' gates of night and day and those of the Theogony.3 Its hypothesis is that Parmenides was deliberately attacking the archaic thought processes represented by Hesiod and wished to present himself as the exponent of a new intellectual approach which would be associ- ated in its spirit with the Homeric ideal of the heroic individual. I The similarity between the Muses' message to Hesiod and the goddess' message to Parmenides has been widely noted.4 7TOL, EVES (YPaUVAOt, K K E'AE'XE 1 yaOUTEpE&amp;t otov, LpLEv EvO/EVa EroAA&amp; AA "yEWv ETV/,LOo'UV o, ca, !SLEV S', EVT E'-OE'AWEV, aAriOEa yrIpvraaaroac.

(B.I.24, 26-30) The vocative mood is followed in both by the assertion of the two- fold character of knowledge, a stress on truth, and anaphoric syntax: '/1 . E .. '8ijE vY, Y7/LEV... 77E. Typically, for Parmenides, the blunt didactic presentation of Hesiod is softened by Homeric politeness. The Theogony's Muses, as though perhaps shepherds themselves, say straight out, "Rustics, disgraces, mere bellies." The goddess, however, greets Parmenides with elaborate epic courtesy. "Graciously, the goddess received me, took my hand in hers and spoke to me these words: '0 youth, accompanied by im-</page><page sequence="3">Parmenides and Hesiod 95 mortal guides and these horses which bring you to our home, welcome. For no evil destiny sent you forth...' "5 This fusion of a basic Hesiodic form with Homeric tone is character- istic of the whole poem. It is repeated in the merger of the Muses with the daughters of the sun, the Heliades, who bring the poet to the gates of night and day and thus to the goddess herself.6 As a group they are the divinities responsible for Parmenides' instruction in the way of truth. If the goddess is comparable to the Muses (as Jaeger believes), then the daughters of the sun may be also. In fact, like the Muses, Moicax 'OAvtTTLCaSES&amp;, KoMpac dOIS alycdXoto they are KoVpat (B.I.5, 9,15, 21) and they have a characteristic patronymic: rHAca'SES Koipat (B.I.9). The Theogony opens with a description of the Muses dancing on Mt. Helicon, then moving away at night, veiled in mist, to sing of Zeus and the Olympians and to instruct Hesiod. Parmenides' poem begins with a chariot journey guided by the Heliades, who have left the house of night and cast off their veils and are bringing Parmenides to his place of instruction beyond the gates.

The didactic song of the Muses came at night, veiled, under Mt. Helicon. The didactic discourse of the Heliades comes in the light, unveiled, beyond the gates of any place or time in this world.7 The Theogony's song of the Muses organized Hellenic religion around Zeus, chief of the third-generation rulers of a changing universe, whom the Muses sang and served. But in Parmenides, Zeus and the Olympians have vanished without a trace, leaving the Kovpat masterless, daughters of a god almost without cult. Their only function is to bear witness to 7r 5V, being itself.</page><page sequence="4">96 Edwin F. Dolin, Jr. To replace the specific, well-defined Muses of Hesiod, Parmenides has created an abstract blend of the sun-daughters of Thrinacia and Circe. II The "gates of the paths of night and day" occur at line ii of the first fragment of Parmenides and recall Theogony 736-57. Hesiod there recounts how the rebellious Titans were confined in Tartarus within a wall guarded by the Hecatoncheires, Kottos, Gyes, and Briareos. The place has gates, beyond which is a huge "chasm," the home of night. In front, Atlas supports the sky near where night and day speak to each other as they pass crossing the threshold. Within are Sleep and Death, Night's children, and Hades' house, guarded by Cerberus, and the loathsome sources and ends of the universe (Theo- gony 736-41, 744-49): IvOa 8E yr 8voEp77 Kl T`prc&amp;pov 7jEpdEVT70O TorrVTOV T aTpvyETOLO Kct ovpcvov CXUTEpOEVTO.

The obvious difference, of course, in these two accounts is that Parmenides asserts that his gates are not in Tartarus, but in the ether (ateO'ptat), just as the chasm beyond his gates contains not Titans, night and death, but the gracious goddess. The "loathsome sources</page><page sequence="5">Parmenides and Hesiod 97 and ends of the universe" give place to the goddess' account of "well- rounded truth's unshaken heart," which is "like the bulk of a well- rounded ball," Being without beginning or end. As guardians of the chasm, the hundred-handed giants have yielded to Dike.

Like the Heliades and the goddess, Dike is at best only a very distant relation to the well-defined anthropomorphic figures of Hesiod and the myth in general. In fact, popular religion, if not religion altogether, is gone, and we are not surprised. But Parmenides' treatment has done more than simply ignore religion. By carefully evoking Hesiod's effort at systematic presentation of the myth, while at the same time draining it of individuality and twisting its images of dark to light, he has doubly condemned it. A new vision of man accompanies this new vision of the universe. He is a traveler on a lonely road - -rvS' 6ev, Iq yap r" &amp;vOp W6iTWV EKTO7 rrd-rov uv. He is not taken in by the 0os- rroAV'7TEtpov, the established wisdom of society. His road is straight ahead, not rraAlv-rporTos like that of other people. But, lonely though it is, this road will lead him to all knowledge XPEw 6 SE rrdv-ra rrvE'crOat. For him, Dike, the law of nature,s will yield and open her gates. He will pass within and "judge by reason the strife-encompassed proof spoken" (B.7.5-6) by the goddess (Kp cvat h Aoy TOAre&amp;St nhp" AEYXOV/ "OEVo p EnV"rua).

In fact, the first notable departure does not come until the end of the "proem," when 5~da and lrraUr suddenly thrust the fifth century and its preoccupations into the Homeric-Hesiodic context, as the goddess explains the double character of knowledge (B.I.30): 7'5 flpor&amp;v 6S'as, raiZs orK V t 7rldUs &amp;0~XA s. Later, the follow- ing nouns characteristic of post-epic language occur: Kp&amp;6iUS, Kptuts, pJt, yEVEOLSE yvva, 0os, , KAEYXOs, 'yKos, rdrros. One verb and one adverb are notably non- epic: vopldw and Eflflahus. Parmenides' nearly twenty negative adjectives include several which occur rarely or seldom in epic: &amp;y7v7-roS, &amp;KVIT7OST, &amp;Vdr7TOS, rcravUros, uavAos.
