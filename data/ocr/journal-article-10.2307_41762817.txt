One of the most fascinating and enigmatic archaeological objects in the Americas is a certain type of anthropomorphic gold pectoral found in southern Panama and, most especially, in Colombia. Called "Darien pectorals," these ornaments are not confined to one region, although their greatest concentration seems to be in the Sinů country in northwestern Colombia, near the border with Panama's Darien Province. They are found also in the Quimbaya region of Colombia, farther south. The dating of the Colombian gold objects and the styles of these objects are still rather indefinite, although archaeologists would generally place Sinů and Quimbaya goldwork in the late pre-Columbian centuries, most likely in the span of 1,000-1,500 A.D., but with the possibility of beginnings as early as 500 A.D. Interestingly, one such "Darien pectoral" has been found as far north as Chichen Itzá in Yucatán, where it undoubtedly found its way as an item of long-distance trade, along with other lower Central American and Colombian gold artifacts. The Maya centre of Chichen Itzá - and its famed cenote of sacrifice, iThis paper is published in English in the Botanical Museum Leaflets of Harvard University and in Spanish in the Boletín Museo del Oro (Banco de la República) Ano 3, Bogotá, Colombia.

This, however, does not help in placing the manufacturing date of the object in ques- tion, as many of the other objects found in the Chichen Itzá cenote were clearly heirloom pieces (Willey, pers. comm.). Although they vary slightly, these ornaments all follow a gen- eral plan. They are anthropomorphic, usually highly stylized. The most prominent feature is the pair of dome-shaped or rounded objects arranged side by side on the head. Lateral wing- like ornaments with spiral decorations made up of double spirals almost invariably frame the head of the pectoral. A flat face or mask, sometimes more or less natural but usually with complex filigree ornamentation, is discernible. Arms and hands hold two sticks or wands usually in an inverted V-shape. A frog or toad, sometimes very natural but usually extremely stylized, is almost always present immediately beneath the face: that is, on the chest. These pectorals have been divided into two general types: "Darien pectorals" and "Darien-related pectorals." The former are the more typical, with most of the principal diagnostic fea- tures; the latter have very stylistic variations and fewer of the main diagnostic features, diverting in one or several ways from the basic morphological pattern of the Darien type. Although a few specimens are to be found in private collec- tions and in several museums, the greatest concentration of these gold pectorals is preserved in the Museo del Oro in Bogotá, Colombia. Thanks to the director, Dr. Luis Duque Gómez, we have had the opportunity of examining in great detail the Muse- um's collection of more than 150 specimens and of conferring with Mrs. Ana María Falchetti de Sáenz, whose meticulous research is embodied in her thesis entitled The Goldwork of the Sinti Region, (Northern) Colombia (Falchetti-Sáenz, 1976). Because of the two dome-like objects on the head, these pec- torals have popularly been called "telephone-bell gods." This term originated apparently from the description given by Dr. José Pérez de Barrada in 1954, when he mentioned "the semi- spherical buttons to which I have referred that remind one of the bells of old fashioned telephones or of a pair of mushrooms" (Pérez, 1954). 114</page><page sequence="3">II. Following the intense ethnomycological activities of Dr. R. Gordon Wasson (Wasson, 1962, 1968, 1972, 1979, 1980), his late wife Dr. Valentina P. Wasson (Wasson and Wasson, 1957), and the late Professor Roger Heim (Heim, 1967, 1978; Heim and Wasson, 1958) unveiling the ancient and the contemporary reli- gious use of hallucinogenic mushrooms in southern Mexico, Pérez de Barrada wrote: "It would not be strange to reconsider with great reserve this casual attribution. It should be noted that these semi-spherical buttons are not fixed directly to the head but are attached by means of filaments soldered to the back of the piece . . . We know nothing about the ritual use of mush- rooms amongst the Indians of Darien at the time of the discov- ery nor later, but if we remember, but keep it in mind, since no trace was found in the indigenous pharmacopoea of the Catios of the Golfo de Urabá, notwithstanding the excellent mono- graph by Father Severino Santa Teresa. On the other hand, the secrecy with which these Indians guard their knowledge of the properties of plants and their shamanistic ceremonies could have hidden a possible use of hallucinogenic mushrooms - a use which might be very ancient and which possibly existed in dis- tinct forms. The bridge between Guatemala and Darien is diffi- cult to establish but easy to suspect. Our suggestion that these buttons represent mushrooms is accepted by A. Emmerich" (Pérez, 1954). This reference to Emmerich leads us directly to the second mention in the literature that these dome-like objects represent mushrooms. "It appears likely that the puzzling, hitherto uni- dentified hemi-spherical head dress ornaments in fact represent a pair of mushrooms, probably of hallucinogenic properties. It is significant that such mushroms are to this day traditionally counted, ceremonially used and consumed in pairs . . . the mush- room head dress ornaments were hammered out separately, riveted to short stems and then soldered to the body" (Emme- rich, 1965).2 2 In a note, Emmerich states: "I am indebted to Mrs. Mary U. Light for her original insight in identifying these ornaments as mushrooms." 115</page><page sequence="4">A third consideration of the "telephone bell gods" as mush- room effigies was offered in 1974 by Professor Peter T. Fürst. Referring to Emmerich, he reported: "André Emmerich developed the interesting theory that the pairs of telephone bell-like, semi-spherical, hollow-stemmed ornaments surmounting the head dress of a certain class of con- ventionalized anthropomorphic gold pectorals in the Dariên style from Colombia ("telephone gods") are in fact mushrooms. Emmerich demonstrated convincingly that over time these orna- ments gradually changed position as the effigies themselves became more and more stylized. On early, more realistic pieces, the mushroom form is unmistakable, the semi-spherical caps being separated from the head dress by stems or stipes attached to the top of the. head. Subsequently, the stipes became shorter and the caps were slightly inclined forward. Eventually, the stipes, though still present beneath the cap, disappeared alto- gether from view and the two caps faced forward like a pair of female breasts. By this time the human characters had also been stylized to the point of abstraction" (Fürst, 1974, 1976). III. Our own studies of the many gold pectorals in the Museo del Oro and our familiarity with the complexities of magico- religious, shamanic or ceremonial use of hallucinogenic plants, together with consideration of the natural range of psilocybine- containing genera of mushrooms in the New World, lead us to the belief that this identification of the dome-shaped head dress ornaments is indeed correct and that, further, they strongly sug- gest the religious use in prehispanic Colombia of intoxicating mushrooms. This interpretation of the gold pectorals has already twice been supported (Schultes and Hofmann, 1979, 1980). No other explanation of the possible significance of these domes has ever, so far as we know, been advanced. Significance they most certainly must have had. We are left, then, with the inescapable conclusion that they cannot represent anything else than mushroms. In a number of the pectorals, the domes are elevated on a stipe. Furthermore, a few of the domes have a mammiform tip 116</page><page sequence="5">characteristic of some species of Psilocybe, and several have a design along the margin of the cap which could be interpreted as indicative of the scalloped edge of the cap of Panaeolus sphinc- trinus. We have, in addition, several tangential arguments which have not hitherto been offered and which, we believe, lend weight to this interpretation. As with the intoxications induced by many hallucinogens, lévitation - the sensation of flying or soaring through the air and visiting distant places - is a commonly experienced psychic effect of psilocybine, the principal active constituent of species of Panaeolus, Psilocybe and Stropharia (Schultes and Hof- mann, 1979; Brown, 1972). In her long and involved chant during the Mazatec mushroom ceremony, for example, the famous shaman Maria Sabina repeatedly sings such descriptive phrases as "Whirling woman am I," "Look, I feel as though I'm going to the sky," "Woman like the big eagle am I," "Woman of space am I" (Halifax, 1979). Dr. Albert Hofmann, the chemist who first isolated psilocybine and psilocine from the sacred mushrooms and who elucidated their structures and synthesized them, mentions lévitation amongst other symptoms produced by small doses of psilocy- bine: ". . . bodily relaxation and detachment from the environ- ment . . . effects . . . associated with a pleasant feeling of extraordinary lightness, a bodily hovering" (Schultes and Hof- mann, 1979, 1980). Wasson, the first to provide a detailed de- scription of psilocybine-mushroom intoxication, reported spe- cifically, amongst many other effects, the experience of lévita- tion: ". . . the bemushroomed person is poised in space, a disembodied eye, invisible, incorporeal, seeing but not seen . . . your body lies in darkness, heavy as lead, but your spirit seems to soar . . . and with the speed of thought to travel where it listeth, in time and space . . ." (Schultes, 1973). The Colombian gold pectorals almost invariably have two wings formed by spirals and arising at an angle lateral to the head dress ornaments. They vary somewhat in shape but always involve spiral filagree work. While occasionally abbreviated, they are usually elongated. We believe that these represent wings, the wings of a mythical bird, and are directly associated with lévitation. Furthermore, we need not detail how frequently 117</page><page sequence="6">and how generally, not only in the Americas but in the Old World as well, are birds associated with hallucinogens, but sev- eral examples will suffice. Amongst the Koryaks of Siberia, the culture hero, Big Raven, discovered the hallucinogenic mushroom Amanita muscaria from the spittle of the god Vihiyinin (Schultes and Hofmann, 1980). The mythical Thunder Bird carries the prayers of the peyote-eating Indians of the United States to heaven (LaBarre, 1938), and lévitation is important in the Huichol peyote ritual in Mexico (Fürst and Anguiano, 1977). In eastern Brazil, the Indi- ans who drank vinho de jurema (Mimosa hostilis) flew all night carried on the back of a huge bird that skirted thundering rapids and showed its passengers the abodes of the dead (Gonçalves de Lima, 1946). In several "Darien-related pectorals," the hands hold a bar on which are perched four birds. In one of the pectorals, the birds are movable. We suggest that, in these examples, too, the avian ornamentation indicates association with the flying sensation experienced in mushroom intoxication. But there is an even more compelling argument for the hallu- cinogenic connection of the pectorals: the frog or toad. Almost all of the pectorals are ornamented with these amphibian fig- ures. In some cases, the figure is realistic; in others, it is flat but easily discernible - with eyes, legs and a median dorsal band, indicating undoubtedly the coloured band on some of these animals. In most, however, it is highly stylized, their eyes and legs represented by circles of double spirals, the tail portion indicated by a flat triangular projection, and the snout repre- sented occasionally by a knob-like protuberance. This extraordinarily constant association of the frog or toad with the pectorals would seem to have deep significance. No other animals represent change and transition more sharply with their dramatic metamorphosis and fertility - passing from the egg to a wholly water-living, gill-breathing creature resembling a fish to a terrestrial, four-legged amphibian. Furthermore, cer- tain frogs of the Dendrobatidae are frighteningly toxic - one species producing the most highly poisonous substance known (Daly and Myers, 1967; Daly and Witkop, 1971). For millenia and in widely separated parts of the globe, frogs and toads have 118</page><page sequence="7">been associated with origin myths, mysticism, rain and fecun- dity, the moon, magic and, especially, with intoxication from hallucinogenic agents (Wasson, 1980). This significance of the toad-frog motif has been emphasized by Fürst (Fürst, 1974, 1976) who succinctly states: . . there is clearly much more than only the 'obvious' connection with rain to account for the impor- tance of the toad-frog motif in the indigenous symbolic system . . (Fürst, 1979). Hallucinogenic constituents found in plants employed for their psychoactive properties have been isolated from frogs and toads. The alkaloid bufotenine, known from the leguminous tree Anadenanthera peregrina from which a highly psychoactive snuff is prepared in South America (Holmstedt and Lindgren, 1967), is present in the skin glands of Bufo marinus and other amphibians (Schultes and Holmstedt, 1968). The related and more potent hallucinogen, 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine, one of the active components of the snuff prepared in South America from several species of Virola trees (Schultes and Holmstedt, 1968), has recently been found in the North Ameri- can desert toad, Bufo alvarius (Fürst, 1974). Extremely toxic substances occur in the skin of some species of Phyllobates and Dendrobates, colourful amphibians of northwesternmost South America in the general region where the gold pectorals are found in greatest concentration. The venoms of some South American frogs and toads are employed in magical contexts, sometimes producing even ecstatic or hallucinogenic states. It was the Swedish anthropologist S. Henry Wassén who, many years ago, reviewed the literature and concluded ". . . that the ubiquitous frog/ toad motif in South American mythology and art, includ- ing the great number of effigies of cast gold from prehispanic Colombia and Panama, was inseparable from the practical use of frog venom for blowgun dart poison (which in any event had a magical component) and from the widespread magico- religious beliefs and practices involving the toxins of different species of these amphibians" (Wassén, 1934). Frog poison - probably from a species of Phyllobates or Dendrobates - is used by hunters among the Amahuaca Indians of Amazonian Peru for inducing hallucinations: the poison is rubbed on self-inflicted cuts, inducing a violent illness, characterized by vomiting, diar- 119</page><page sequence="8">rhoea, convulsions, unconsciousness. Supernatural expertness in the hunt results from the hallucinations which are interpreted as communication with forest spirits (Fürst, 1974). There can no longer be any doubt that the high place occupied in magico-religious spheres by frogs and toads must be attrib- uted in great part to the toxic properties of some species. Although the potently poisonous South American species can- not be termed hallucinogenic in the usual sense of that word, their toxins do act upon the central nervous system with effects so unreal as to induce the Indian to ascribe supernatural powers to the animal and actually visual and other hallucinations may indeed accompany the violent intoxications caused by agents that can in no wise be considered true hallucinogens (Fürst, 1974, 1976). For, as has been correctly pointed out: . . the massive assault on the system brought on by bufotenine- containing Bufo venom is of a very different order than the shift from one state of consciousness to another triggered by bufo- tenine-containing snuff' (Fürst, 1974). Perhaps it may not be wholly coincidental that toads were so frequently added as an ingredient of the hallucinogenic witches brews of medieval Europe. Whether as hallucinogen-inducing organisms^ or as poisonous animals causing what might be termed pseudohallucination syn- dromes, these amphibians assumed - for this and other peculiari- ties - a significance in aboriginal mythology and magic, an exalted position amongst the peoples who created the Colombian gold work. In almost every gold-working culture of Colombia, there are numerous examples of the toad-frog motif. There are hundreds of specimens in the Museo del Oro in Bogotá. These are espe- cially abundant in the Tairona area of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta. From the surviving aboriginal groups of Indians still living in this region, it is known that the frog is considered a mythological being at the center of the cosmos (Reichel- Dolmatoff, 1963). We believe that, especially when other characteristics of the gold pectorals (wings, birds, mushrooms) are taken into account, the constancy of the frog-toad motif on these artifacts must of necessity be interpreted as an indication that they played some 120</page><page sequence="9">role in a magico-religious system based on the hallucinatory experience. That no reference to the hallucinogenic use of mush- rooms amongst the Indians of Colombia is found in the writings of the Spanish conquerors hardly argues against the possibility of such employment: the use and the cults connected with the mushrooms may well have died out between the dates of the latest gold pectorals and the 16th Century. IV. It would, of course, be a futile exercise to presume that the gold pectorals in question - or any other artifact, for that matter - represent the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms, unless mushrooms possessing psychotomimetic constituents actually do occur in the region where the artifacts were made and used. Although the collection and study of mushrooms in Colombia is still in a very preliminary stage, psilocybine-containing species have been reported. Species of Psilocybe are known to be widely distributed in the world, and the field studies of Dr. Gastón Guzmán in 1964 and 1971 have indicated that hallucinogenic species of Psilocybe occur in Colombia (Guzmán and Varela, 1978). The localities are widely distributed throughout the nation and vary from the warm lowlands to páramos at high elevation. According to Guzmán, the following species of Psilo- cybe have been registered from Colombia: P. antillarum (Fr.) Quél., P. argentina (Speg.) Sing., P. bullacea (Bull, ex Fr.) Kumm., P. Columbia Guzmán, P. Pintonii Guzmán and P. sub- cubensis Guzmán (which is occasionally considered to be a var- iant of Stropharia cubensis). A number of these mushrooms are presumably psilocybine-containing, since they are cyanescent and have a farinaceous odor and taste - indicative, according to Guzmán's experience, that they are hallucinogenic. Further- more, Panaeolus sphinctrinus (Fr.) Bresadola, known as one of the hallucinogenic mushrooms of Mexico, has been collected in Colombia (Guzmán and Varela, 1978). Guzmán writes in a letter: "I agree with you that the South American Indians used hallucinogenic species of Psilocybe. I reported 30 species from South America, but I think that there are more, but we need more explorations. Even I think that the 121</page><page sequence="10">Indians from the Atlantic zone and not only those of the Andes used the hallucinogenic mushrooms." The recent field work of Dr. Kenneth Dumont has resulted in the registration from Colombia of other species of Psilocybe, a number of which may likewise be psilocybine-containing (Dumont, pers. comm.). V. Our studies of the Darien and Darien-related gold pectorals of Colombia have strengthened our belief that mushrooms perhaps enjoyed a widespread magico-religious place in aboriginal cul- tures from Mexico, through Central America and in the Andes south to Peru. There are many pieces of evidence that may be interpreted as supporting such a belief. One manifestation of this cultural trait is provided by the numerous "mushroom stones" of Mexico, Guatemala and El Salvador, which have been extensively stu- died and documented (Borhegyi, 1957, 1961; Wasson, 1957; Rose, 1977). Four of these stone figures significantly have a frog-figure at their base (Wasson, 1980). Further south in Mex- ico and extending southeastward to El Salvador are various ceramic representations which have been interpreted as mush- room-related artifacts. From Colombia, there is one ceramic object from the area of greatest concentration of gold Darien pectorals which, although far less convincing than the gold objects, might be interpreted as representing a mushroom, since it has an undulating "cap" which occurs in some species of Psilo- cybe. There are, furthermore, numerous clay artifacts from Mexico with representations of mushrooms in contexts sugges- tive of their significance in magico-religious rituals (Borhegyi, 1963; Fürst, 1974). We might also mention at this point that several unusual "mushroom-like" ceramic pieces have been excavated at Arara- cuara in the Colombian Amazon (Herrera, pers. comm.). Further to the south in the Andes, ceramic pots in the form of a human head with a mushroom-like protuberance from the forehead are frequent in the Mochica. This protuberance could not function as a handle: if the pot were filled with liquid, it 122</page><page sequence="11">would be too heavy to be supported by such a brittle handle. To the best of our knowledge, no functional explanation of this type of protuberance has been offered. They are all in shape very suggestive of mushrooms. One of the pots figured actually has painted flecks on the cap which might lead one to suspect that it represents Amanita muscaria, even though the species is believed not to have existed this far south in pre-Columbian times. These and other pottery artifacts, considered in detail by Fürst (Fürst, 1974), tend to support the belief that mushrooms were impor- tant in pre-Columbian art in more than one locality in the Andes of South America. VI. It has only recently been discovered that the fly agaric Aman- ita muscaria, has deep-rooted religious significance and is still ceremonically used by the Ojibway Indians living on Lake Superior in the United States (Wasson, 1979) and that Indians of the Mackensie River area of British Columbia, Canada, sim- ilarly employ this hallucinogen (Halifax, pers. comm.). It is possibly significant that the Mackensie River area, being largely glacier-free in the Pleistocene, may have been one of the main routes taken by early man on his migrations from Siberia to the Americas. Perhaps it may not be superfluous, in closing, to point out that from Asia ancient mythological ideas stemming from the use of hallucinogenic mushrooms and their concomitant associ- ations are traceable in European witchcraft, in the cult of soma in the Indian subcontinent, in the use of fly agaric in Siberia and at least in two contemporary and unrelated and widely separated indigenous groups in North America. In view of the recognized widespread magico-religious use of mushrooms in the New World, we believe that the interpretation of the Colombian "telephone bell gods," as mushroom-related artifacts, represents perhaps the most plausible explanation thus far advanced and that it may be of the utmost importance in our studies of the role of hallucinogens in aboriginal societies of the New World. 123</page><page sequence="12">124</page><page sequence="13">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Permission to publish plates 23 to 33 has graciously been given by Dr. Luis Duque-Gomez, Director, Museo del Oro, Bogotá, Colombia.
