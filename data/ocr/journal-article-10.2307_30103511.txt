One statuette was discovered at Tegea in south- eastern Arcadia, and two at Lousoi in northern Arcadia; single examples were also found at Olympia and on the island of Samos. Though each differs in details, the five riders are all similar in general concept, consisting of nude human figures (female, when the gender is indicated) riding side-saddle on horses, sometimes with saddles or foot-rests, and with arms in a variety of positions. These Geometric-style riders have attracted the attention of several scholars over the years, because of their distinctive appearance and their limited distribution in comparison with other, more standard, bronze dedications. Interest in the type is enhanced by a relatively greater number of representations in terracotta in the Archaic period. Schweitzer considers some of the bronze and terracotta votives in the course of a discussion of the identity of the rider seated side-saddle type. He argues that the image was derived from a Mycenaean religious system that survived in Arcadia, and identifies the riders as Artemis Soteira.2 Despite his consideration of the origin of the type, however, Schweitzer does not appear to know about the existence of riders seated side-saddle from the Late Bronze Age. The Minoan and Mycenaean riders were portrayed seated on fantastic animals, which led Levi to believe that the type originally came into Aegean iconography from the Near East.3 A thirteenth-century terracotta rider from a Mycenaean chamber tomb differs from the earlier depictions, in that the rider is shown on a horse.4 Levi's study of the Bronze Age riders was followed by others, but no scholars have taken into account the Bronze Age riders' relationship to the later examples in bronze and terracotta.5 At the heart of the issue is whether any factors, other than coincidence, lie behind the apparent similarity of the Bronze Age riders to the later Geometric and Archaic ones. Some scholars assume the existence of some sort of unspecified link, despite the hundreds ' This article developed out of a paper offered at the 9oth Annual General Meeting of the Archaeological Insti- tute of America in Jan. 1989; see AJA 93 (1989), 273.

A question of identity is raised in this context as well. Are we simply looking at depictions of ordinary women, or are they female deities with some undefined association with horses? Riders seated side-saddle have also been found on Cyprus. The role of Cyprus in the transmission of the type is pertinent to this discussion. Karageorghis describes a number of terracotta riders from Cypriot sites dating to the end of the Bronze Age and to the eighth century BC. The Cypriot riders differ significantly from the Bronze and Iron Age Greek examples in gender: all are male. Karageorghis believes that the type was derived from a Mycenaean source.8 He does not mention the existence of the later Greek examples in connection with the riders from Cyprus; but Schweitzer had thought there was a link between Cyprus and the Greek riders. Long before any rider figurines had been discovered on Cyprus, he had argued that the bronze rider from Samos was made in a Cypriot workshop.9 Although there is no direct evidence for this view, it is clear that the Samian rider is significantly different from the others. Unlike the other bronze riders, she holds a baby in her arms and has a non-Greek appearance.'0 The role of Cyprus vis-a-vis the riders thus requires further attention. The present study offers a more comprehensive history of statuettes of riders seated side-saddle in Greece. The inspiration for, and identity of, the riders are discussed, and the possible connections between the Bronze Age and Iron Age examples are evaluated. The necessary conditions which would allow the type either to be preserved through the Dark Age or to be reintroduced in the Iron Age are considered, and the role of Cyprus is further explored. Places of production for the Geometric examples are examined in the light of recent research on local bronze workshops. The limited geographical distribution of the type is taken into account, with a particular focus on Arcadia. The significance of the Geometric riders is assessed, and their identity is explored within the context of eighth-century sanctuaries. CATALOGUE OF GEOMETRIC RIDERS IN BRONZE i.

She sits in a fancy saddle with a high armrest and two decorated bands around the back. A foot-rest appears to be indicated. Quadruped wears a harness; it has a long narrow neck and ears jutting forward, features which are not particularly equine. As is often the case with early votive offerings, stratigraphic contexts are unavailable for dating these bronzes. The two Lousoi riders (I-2) were acquired at the end of the nineteenth century by the Karlsruhe and Vienna museums, without any precise informa- tion about their contexts.16 The Tegean rider (3) was presumably found in a black layer of earth in the region of the temple, together with many other votives, ranging in date from at least Protogeometric to the mid-seventh century." The findspots of 4, the Olympia rider (in the second south wall of the stadium), and 5, the Samian rider (south of the large altar of Hera) do not permit accurate dating. Despite the lack of stratigraphical information for the riders, the manner of depiction of the quadrupeds and the human figures permits a date based on stylistic criteria to the latter half of the eighth century.18 A possible sequence of production is suggested by levels of sophistication in the depiction of the riders. The simplest rider is from Tegea (FIG. 3); it has no saddle, footrest, anatomical details, or ornamentation. The Lousoi rider (FIG. I) is the closest to the Tegea example in terms of simplicity of style, though it has the addition of a saddle. These two may stand at the beginning of the sequence. The other Lousoi statuette (FIG. 2) is considerably more elaborate; the female is depicted with breasts and the horse is provided with a saddle and decoration on its mane. The rider from Olympia (FIG. 4) is more advanced still, with the addition of facial featueres, breasts, fingers, saddle, and footrest. Finally, the rider from Samos (FIG. 5) is the most advanced; this is indicated by the baby in the arms of the rider, the elaborate saddle and footrest, the greater degree of represen- tation of the facial features, and the details of hair, fingers, and necklaces. On the basis of style, then, the riders from Tegea and Lousoi may have been the earliest examples made, sometime in the second half of the eighth century. S C.

The bronzes are generally of a more standard type, however, consisting of quadrupeds and human figures made separately, either to be affixed to a tripod cauldron or to be left free- standing; in addition, votive birds, jewellery, and pendants were offered.20 Seen amongst this variety of bronze dedications, the five statuettes of riders seated side-saddle are unusual offerings. The rider statuettes have attracted discussion as to their style and place of production. The Lousoi riders (1-2) are argued by some to have been made in a local Arcadian workshop, on the basis of their horses.21 Others maintain that the one horse (in FIG. I) was a product of an Olympian workshop, and that the second (in FIG. 2) was an example of an Argive-Olympian quadruped derived from an Argive prototype.22 The author has discussed the place of manufacture for the Lousoi riders elsewhere, and has suggested that both were made locally in a productive workshop in the Lousoi vicinity for dedication to Artemis. There is evidence to support the case for the local working of bronze at the site; the great variety and amount of bronze votives found at Lousoi further enhance this view.23 Although some connection is apparent between certain types of bronzes found at Olympia and at Lousoi, there is no particular reason to assume that the Lousoi riders were made in Olympia.24 The statuette from Tegea (3) is also likely to have been made in a local bronze workshop. The horse has a strong parallel with another horse figurine from the site.25 Of the five examples of riders seated side-saddle, this is the only one with a base-plate. This type of solid base-plate is commonly found supporting the horse and human figurines from Tegea. In addition, the simple depiction of the human figure was a usual feature of this workshop and further strengthens the case for local production. The example from Olympia, 4, has some novel features in comparison with the other statuettes. Although the rider is portrayed as a stick figure, she also has significant traits such as outstretched arms, facial features, breasts, and fingers, and is provided with a footrest. Heilmeyer considered the horse to be a standard Olympian product made under Argive influence. There are other similar horses from Olympia, which suggests that the statuette was produced either at Olympia or at some other Peloponnesian (or Arcadian) workshop that made numerous dedications for the sanctuary.26 The rider from Samos, 5, is more problematic. The place of its production is obscure. There are some Peloponnesian features in the quadruped, and possibly in details of the 19 A. M.

Also note that the 1990 excavations at Tegea yielded large pieces of bronze slag in a 7th cent. BC context, found in the area N of the temple. It is thus conceivable that local bronze production was taking place at the site from at least the 7th cent. and probably earlier. See M.

The lower part of the animal is similar in appearance to one of the Lousoi horses (FIG. I), but the long, narrow neck and extended head with ears jutting forward are not especially equine.28 When found, this figure was believed to be foreign-made; this view has received support over the years.29 The statuette is now generally believed to be Caucasian (see discussion below). In all cases, these bronze statuettes represent an unusual votive type at their respective sanctuary sites. Among the hundreds of horses, birds, human figurines, pins, and fibulae, the riders seated side-saddle are rare and distinctive. Unfortunately, the meaning of this rider image within the context of eighth-century sanctuaries is ambiguous. To judge from their findspots, there is no doubt that they were made specifically for dedication. In order to understand the significance of these riders and reasons for their relative rarity, it is necessary to explore the possible origins for the type, which has a long and varied history in Aegean art and iconography.

These seal impressions were found in carbonized debris in the north-west corner of the Minoan villa, and depict a woman wearing a flounced skirt and seated on the back of a strange animal or monster (FIG. 6). A similar scene was depicted on the seal impression from Gournia. Illustrations of related fantastic animals without riders have been found elsewhere on Crete.37 On the mainland, examples of riders seated side-saddle are known from fourteenth-century BC sites in the Argolid. Eight blue glass plaques were found in a tholos tomb at Dendra, near Medea (FIG. 7). A fragmentary ivory plaque with a female rider on a dragon was found in a tomb at Mycenae. Finally, a lentoid seal with a similar scene was discovered near the tomb of Clytemnaestra at Mycenae (FIG. 8). In all these cases the female wears a flounced skirt, has her arms upraised, and sits side-saddle on an unusual quadruped. It has been argued that the inspiration for the depiction of female riders seated side-saddle on quadrupeds was derived from Near Eastern iconography. Levi identifies the fantastic creature in the Minoan and Mycenaean examples as an adaptation of the 27 Schweitzer 157. 28 While a case might be made to identify the animal as a donkey, it appears more likely to be a horse on the basis of its graceful pose and the depiction of the lower body. 21Jantzen (n.

Gill supports the view of an Eastern derivation, and argues that the exact details of the Mesopotamian dragon were lost in transit to the Aegean. He further suggests that the Minoans would have come into contact with the dragon through Syrian intermediaries, from whom they learned of its physical appearance and its associations with deities. The function of this animal would thus have been understood as transportation for a god.39 Poursat argues for an Egyptian source. He bases his case particularly on the illustrations of the countryside in the Aegean scenes, where papyrus flowers are depicted in a manner similar to Egyptian scenes; he identifies the fantastic animal as the Egyptian 'dragon-crocodile'.40 He notes that the undulating lines indicating the earth are also seen on Egyptian fragments, corresponding to the Egyptian 38 Gill (n. 5), 1-4; Levi (n. 3), 27o-80.

Poursat concludes that the similarities in depiction of the terrain and the image of the 'dragon-crocodile' reflect the connection between Minoan beliefs and the Egyptian conception of the land of the dead. The motif of a rider seated side-saddle on a quadruped had a long history in Near Eastern art, beginning in the late third millennium Bc and continuing down well into the first.41 There are few examples of deities seated side-saddle on quadrupeds in Egyptian iconography, however, and creatures such as 'dragon-crocodiles' are depicted alone. An Egyptian source for the Minoan dragon, moreover, cannot be inferred from the illustra- tions of papyrus flowers depicted together with the dragon in Minoan art; these flowers were also popular as a ceramic motif and are found on frescoes.42 A scene on a fragment of pottery of the eighteenth dynasty from Deir-el-Medineh, however, shows a female rider seated side-saddle on a horse. This depiction is closer to the Aegean riders than the 'dragon-crocodiles'. The rider has been identified as Astarte, though there is uncertainty surrounding the attribution. Unfortunately, the image bears only a general resemblance to the Aegean riders.43 The Eastern riders seated side-saddle also differ from the Aegean ones in that they usually do not sit directly on the animal's back but on thrones or cushions (FIG. 9). There was a long history in the Near East of depicting deities or important personages seated side-saddle in this manner.44 The human figures were male or female, the quadrupeds either dragons or actual animals. It appears that the side-saddle pose in itself served to distinguish the status of the rider, and that the dragons generally transported deities. The Minoan artists seem to have adapted this type of depiction to suit their own needs; a deity was shown riding directly on the back of the quadruped, just as Cretan women did and have continued to do since. The figure was depicted as female, with upraised arms, and clad in a Minoan flounced skirt. It appears that the Minoans connected the dragon with their chief goddess in her own garments, rather than with a male god as was more common in Mesopotamia. The female's divinity is expressed by the position of her arms in a ritual gesture, and by her dress. This concept of a rider seated side-saddle on a dragon appears to have been assimilated into the Mycenaean artistic repertoire. There is no evidence to suggest that the Mycenaeans borrowed the depiction from the Near East or Egypt directly; rather, it is likely that they adopted the image from Crete. The Mycenaean examples have the closest ties with the Minoan riders in terms of the nature of depiction of the animal and the appearance of the female with flounced skirt and upraised arms. Both the Minoan and Mycenaean riders were depicted on two-dimensional plaques or seals in a variety of media. Three-dimensional riders appear in terracotta later in the Bronze Age. A terracotta rider seated side-saddle on a horse was found in a tomb at Spata, in Attica (FIG. Io). The statuette has been dated to the thirteenth or twelfth century BC. The female figure is a psi-type with upraised arms; she is seated on a saddled quadruped. Crouwel calls the animal an 'equid of uncertain species'.45 It is most likely a horse, though its short legs and ' Crouwel 51; Levi (n. 3), 269-73. 42 Gill (n. 5), 4. 43 Poursat (n. 5), 467-8, fig. 2.

Another terracotta rider seated side-saddle, attributed to the 'fourteenth to the twelfth centuries BC', was found at Archanes, Crete. The rider, with no gender indicated, is seated sideways on a U-shaped saddle. The quadruped, presumably a horse, is proportionately much larger than the Attic example. The human figure has one hand resting on the saddle, the other on the horse's mane near its head. These terracotta examples, especially the one from Attica, are stylistically and chronologically the closest parallels for the bronze votives that appear in eighth-century sanctuaries. A discovery possibly related to the terracottas is a Linear B tablet from Pylos referring to a POTINIJA IQEJA (PY AN 1281), a 'Mistress of the Horse'.46 The tablet was uncovered in the large room of the north-east wing of the palace of Pylos, close to an outside court where an altar and small chapel were found. Rousseau suggests that the Mistress of the Horse was the divine protectress of at least part of the palace. Chadwick sees the title 'Potnia' (or Mistress) in itself as a reference to a specific female deity who was worshipped at a number of different places in various forms.47 The close association of this find with a sacred area within the palace at Pylos may be relevant. No less significant is that roughly contemporary with the reference are terracotta figurines which may illustrate a Mistress of the Horse. This Linear B tablet and the terracotta riders invite us to consider the significance of the horse in Bronze Age Greece. It is known that horses were introduced into the Greek world from Anatolia in the Middle Helladic period.48 In Late Bronze Age art, horses are used primarily by the aristocracy; they are not common beasts of burden.49 They are usually represented with chariots - in military or hunting contexts, in religious or funerary processions, or in chariot races.5o The portrayal of a female seated side-saddle on a horse, and not on a mythical quadruped, may reflect a development from the earlier Aegean illustrations where she rides a fantastic creature. The horse was highly respected in Mycenaean culture and not commonly used for riding.5' For this reason, it was perhaps considered appropriate for the transport of a divinity. It is noteworthy that Hood has attempted to argue that the early Aegean quadrupeds (the Minoan dragons) depicted on the seals were also horses, similar to early illustrations of horses in Eastern art.52 While the details of the early Aegean creatures (paws, tails, etc.) bear no resemblance to features of horses, it is known that in other Indo-European cultures horses were depicted as mythical beasts.53 There is thus a possibility that the early Aegean illustrations of fantastic quadrupeds were depictions of horses too. It is conceivable that, together with the introduction of the horse into the Aegean, came the Indo-European name for it, as well as certain mythical or religious associations.54 It has been noted that Indo-European cultures shared an inclination to worship the horse, 46 M.

It is possible that such an association of a deity with a horse was assimilated into Aegean religion and iconography. The findspots in tombs for many of the Aegean riders seated side-saddle may reflect something of the function of the deity. She may have been associated with life after death and fertility generally. THE ROLE OF CYPRUS: A CASE FOR SURVIVAL THROUGH THE DARK AGE? It is unclear whether the Bronze Age riders were the direct forerunners of the eighth- century bronzes found at a small number of Greek sanctuary sites. If so, one must account for the intervening period of at least 400 years from which no such representations have come to light. It is possible that the type survived through the Dark Age in other media, such as textiles, or persisted in human memory and oral traditions. Equally, it could be a case of the revival of older elements of cult in the period known as the Greek renaissance. The reintroduction of the type in bronze may also have been the result of foreign contact, prompting a renewed appearance. The island of Cyprus, where riders seated side-saddle were depicted in the Late Bronze Age and the early Iron Age, may provide some insight into these issues. A significant difference between the Greek and Cypriot riders is that the examples known from Cyprus depict males, rather than females, riding side-saddle. The custom of depicting male riders was probably derived from Eastern art. A terracotta rider is known from the mid- thirteenth century Bc;56 another terracotta rider, possibly from Xerolimni near Kouklia, is dated to the eleventh century.57 A recent discovery from an eighth-century (Cypro- Geometric III) tomb at Old Paphos is a terracotta horse and rider group, consisting of a long-necked male riding side-saddle and holding a lyre in his arms.58 The findspot is particularly significant for the cemetery at Skales, Old Paphos, shows evidence of a strong Mycenaean presence and continuous, uninterrupted habitation from the Late Bronze Age well into the Iron Age.59 It appears that the Cypriot riders were first made after Mycenaean Greeks had settled on the island, in the thirteenth century BC. Karageorghis notes that there are no contemporary Eastern prototypes known for the Late Bronze Age Cypriot riders, and that the nearest parallel is the terracotta from Spata in Attica. It is noteworthy, however, that the Cypriot statuettes reveal both Mycenaean and local traits. The divergence of the Cypriot riders from the Aegean ones may reflect local Cypriot taste, which contained a blending of indigenous Cypriot and Eastern elements.60 It is conceivable that this type of depiction survived through the centuries in Cyprus, where continued occupation at some sites, such as Old Paphos, is attested. The survival of the type in Cyprus may offer a parallel for a similar occurrence in mainland Greece, especially in regions that may have been continually inhabited but relatively isolated during the Dark Age. Such a case could 55 Ibid. 56 Karageorghis (n. 8), 131, pl. 17. 1-2. 57 H. W. Catling, 'The Bomford horse and rider', RDAC 1974, 97-100, fig. I; F. G. Maier and V.

The linguistic connections between Arcadia and Cyprus have long been recognized. Both regions preserved elements of an older dialect, most closely akin to Mycenaean Greek. These two relatively isolated areas revealed dialects in historic times which had many similar and unusual features, hence the name 'Arcado-Cyprian' for the dialect. Of all Greek dialects, it has the closest affinities to Linear B.62 In addition to certain features of language being preserved in these regions, it is conceivable that other aspects of culture were also retained. The concentration of riders seated side-saddle in eighth-century Arcadia supports this hypothesis. Although no Late Bronze Age riders are yet known from Arcadia itself, this geographically remote region appears to have provided a refuge for Mycenaeans, as did Cyprus, during the great destructions in the Argolid and elsewhere in the Peloponnese in the thirteenth and twelfth centuries. In the ensuing Dark Age the isolation of Arcadia permitted a greater chance of survival for certain aspects of Mycenaean culture than other regions. The archaeological record for Bronze Age Arcadia is limited. The information we have comes from surveys and some excavation.63 Recently, however, south-western Arcadia has been further investigated and has revealed considerable evidence from tombs, which contain abundant Mycenaean III c and Submycenaean material, suggesting the existence of refugee settlements.64 There is also some evidence from eastern Arcadia. The sanctuary at Tegea has revealed a small number of finds that span the Dark Age, suggesting that the site was in use from the twelfth century BC. These include two III c stirrup jar fragments (one early III c, one late III c), a twelfth-century psi-figurine, twelfth-century bronzes (two fibulae and a female figurine), and many Protogeometric pottery fragments.65 At Lousoi there is no clear evidence of activity from the Late Bronze Age, though the current excavations there may shed more light on the earlier period. A Linear B tablet from Pylos inscribed 'the Gods of the Lousoi territory' is the only hint of earlier activity there; it may refer to the sacred nature of this vicinity in the Late Bronze Age.66 The present archaeological evidence thus appears to point to Tegea as the likely place where a memory of the image survived. Tegea may also have been the place where the first bronze rider was made and dedicated in the eighth century (see above). The site's proximity to the Argolid, where most of the Mycenaean riders were found, may also be significant. The bronze rider from Samos seems to belong to a different cultural tradition. Schweitzer attempts to show that it was made in Cyprus and imported to Samos. There are no bronze riders known from Cyprus, however, and the eighth-century terracotta rider from Cyprus is very different from the contemporary Greek examples; the rider is male 61 Voyatzis (n. 58), 161-2; see also Turnbull (n. 2), 16. 62J.

It is conceivable that the similarities Schweitzer observes between the Samos rider and some Cypriot terracotta figurines are due to common Eastern influences. Schweitzer also notices Peloponnesian elements in the quadruped of the Samos statuette and in details of the rider. This is not surprising, since it is known that other eighth-century bronzes from Samos likewise reflect Peloponnesian traits.67 The most significant feature of this bronze, however, is its similarity in appearance to bronzes from the Caucasus. In Jantzen's study of the bronzes from Samos, he argues that this rider is the most interesting of all the Caucasian imports to Samos.68 Jantzen sees Caucasian affinities in the precise treatment of detail, such as the broad necklace and long hair of the female rider and the thick tail of the horse. He makes no mention in this context, however, of the four other Greek examples of riders seated side-saddle. In the light of the thematic similarity of the five statuettes, their roughly contemporary dates, and the fact that they were all found at Greek sanctuaries, this is a surprising omission. A number of examples of female riders seated side-saddle and holding a baby are known from a necropolis in modern-day western Georgia (ancient Colchis) in the Caucasus region. At an eighth- to seventh-century BC tomb at the site of Oureki, a bronze rider holding a baby in her arms and seated side-saddle on a quadruped (horse or donkey) was discovered.69 Further similar figurines, of the so-called 'Grande MWre des Dieux', were apparently found at this site. The example illustrated by Lordkipanidze and Mikeladze provides the closest known parallel to the Samian bronze. There are important differences too, however. The Georgian example is cast in two separate pieces, not as a single one like the Samian bronze. The figure is also much more simply portrayed; she has neither saddle nor necklace. But the overall conception bears a striking resemblance to the Samian bronze. Other Caucasian bronzes depict female riders seated side-saddle on double protome horses; these examples may also be linked to the riders holding babies.70 It is known that Samos had close connections with the Caucasus from the sixth century onwards.7 The Samian bronze rider seated side-saddle, as well as other Caucasian bronzes from the Heraion on Samos, suggest that some links with the Causasus went back to the eighth century BC. The enigmatic Samos rider thus appears to possess a mixture of traits, but has a predominantly Caucasian appearance. This apparent combination of influences speaks for a workshop situated somewhere where Greek, Orientalizing and Caucasian elements were all present, possibly on Samos itself. Schweitzer argued that the craftsman who produced the Samian bronze had seen the Olympia rider.72 Although this statement cannot be substantiated, it is clear that the Samian bronze is an advanced version of the side-saddle rider type. In view of the evidence from the Caucasus, the island of Cyprus may thus be seen, not as the source of the Samian bronze, but, like Arcadia, as a place where the rider image survived through the Dark Age. In geographically isolated places such as Arcadia, where the significance of a rider seated side-saddle on a horse was conceivably retained, it is 6 See the bronzes in Coldstream (n. 20), 256-7; see also U.

In the eighth century BC, when all aspects of Greek life were being rejuvenated,73 the image of a rider seated side-saddle on a quadruped began to be made again, in a very simple form and at relatively remote sites in Arcadia (Tegea and Lousoi). This revival may in turn have prompted the dedication at Olympia. The Samos bronze may initially have been influenced by the Olympia rider or another rider statuette, but is clearly the product of a different tradition and is apparently meant to portray the Caucasian Great Mother.74 The predominance of rider statuettes in the Peloponnese, and the fact that no eighth-century riders seated side-saddle have been found at more accessible sites such as Argos, Corinth, or Sparta, suggest that the influence originated in Arcadia, where some memory of the image was conceivably preserved through the Dark Age.

At the sanctuary of Artemis Hemera at Lousoi, the source of two bronze riders seated side-saddle, a later terracotta rider was found (FIG. 13). She differs from the bronze examples in that she is draped to the feet and has the boxy hairstyle found on other local terracottas from Lousoi. The terracotta rider from Hagios Sostis may be significant because of its proximity to the Tegea sanctuary. Hagios Sostis is on a hill which is part of the greater city of Tegea, and is just north of the region where the temple of Athena Alea is situated. This statuette is much later than the bronze riders, and differs significantly from all other examples in that the female is seated on a camel. The site at Hagios Sostis appears to have been a shrine dedicated to Demeter.82 Many examples of riders are known from Laconia: fourteen from the sanctuary of Artemis at Sparta, and at least five from the neighbouring Menelaion. Riders seated side-saddle are also known from sites elsewhere in the Peloponnese. There are single examples from the sanctuary of Hera at Perachora, the Argive Heraion, and the sanctuary 7" Snodgrass (n.

Richardson, 'Terracotta figurines from Corinth', AJA 2 (1898), 2Io, fig. II.) As for the remains of the so-called rider from Amyklai, I have seen a photograph and believe it unlikely that they could be reconstructed as a rider seated side-saddle.

The next terracotta rider in the sequence is from Artemis Orthia at Sparta, and dates to the later seventh century. The rest of the riders, from Laconia, the Argive Heraion, Perachora, Kombothekra, and Hagios Sostis, are sixth-century in date, the Hagios Sostis example being the latest. It therefore appears that the type in terracotta began at Lousoi and spread to Laconia in the seventh century. Because of the proximity of Tegea and Sparta and the similarities in their material cultures, however, the influence for the first Laconian rider may well have come from Tegea. From Laconia the influence spread north along the east coast of the Peloponnese to Argos and Perachora. A westward diffusion of the rider type is also illustrated by the example from Kombothekra, near Olympia. This rider may have been influenced by the Lousoi terracotta (or even the Olympia bronze), since there were connections between Lousoi and Olympia (and Kombothekra and Olympia) in the types of Geometric and Archaic votives dedicated. It is significant that the majority of terracotta examples known date to the sixth century BC and are from Laconia. The reason why the type became relatively popular in this region may be due to the association of the rider figure with the local cults of Artemis Orthia and Helen. CONNECTION OF ICONOGRAPHIC TYPE WITH EARLY DEITIES Of the 29 bronze and clay riders seated side-saddle known in the Peloponnese, the majority (approximately 18) were dedicated to Artemis, four to Hera, one to Athena Alea, one to Demeter, and five to Helen at the Menelaion.84 The riders from these various sites have generally been thought to represent deities. Weber believes that the Lousoi bronzes depict Artemis. Schweitzer identifies all the terracotta riders (and possibly the earlier bronzes as well) as Artemis Soteira. Coldstream also suggests that the terracotta from Lousoi represents the Arcadian Artemis (later Artemis Soteira), daughter of Demeter and Poseidon Hippios.85 The riders from Sparta were thought by the excavators to represent Artemis Orthia, and those from the Menelaion were believed to be Helen.86 It is, in fact, not clear whether the female riders are meant to depict mortal women or goddesses; if the latter, there is uncertainty about whether they represent the same deity at all sites. In pursuing the question of identity, the Late Bronze Age riders may also be considered. A case has been made for the assimilation of the female riders (seated side-saddle on a fantastic quadruped) from Eastern into Minoan art. It is clear that the side-saddle position was used in Eastern art not only for deities but also for important personages, both male and female; in addition, it is known that fantastic beasts generally carried deities. In Greece and Crete, the side-saddle position was also a common way for women to ride. That the Minoan rider was a deity rather than a mortal woman, however, is likely from her dress and her raised arm gesture. These features are also seen on the Mycenaean riders; in the latest Mycenaean example in terracotta, the female rider is depicted as a psi-figurine. 84 For the purposes of this paper I maintain that the bronze found at Olympia was dedicated to Hera; since numerous deities were worshipped at Olympia, this attribution must remain tentative. It is probable, in any case, that this statuette was dedicated to a female deity, as were all the other Greek rider figurines. For other tabu- lations see Bevan (n. 6), i. 202; ii. 424. Bevan does not include all the riders known, and thus determines a smaller total number. 85 Weber (n. 12), 9; Schweitzer 156-9; Coldstream (n. 20), 157. Zimmermann (n. 6), 323, also believes it likely that the Arcadian bronze riders are deities. 86 Dawkins I5o-1; Thompson (n. 8o), 124.</page><page sequence="17">VOTIVE SIDE-SADDLE RIDERS AT EARLY GREEK SANCTUARIES 275 psi-figurine. Although there is some debate about whether or not psi-figurines represent divinities, they may generally be understood as such.87 The next appearance of the type is in bronze at eighth-century sanctuary sites, predominantly in Arcadia, followed by terracotta riders at seventh- and sixth-century Peloponnesian sanctuaries. The terracotta rider from Lousoi has the same boxy hairstyle and appearance as some other female figurines that are believed to represent the deity at the site."8 While the possibility remains that these females were depicting mortal women, the evidence from the Bronze Age to the sixth century BC suggests that the riders were intended to represent deities. A clue to the identity of the rider lies in her association with the horse. It is known that in Geometric times, as in Mycenaean times, the horse was a highly respected animal. It symbolized wealth and status and, in votive form, was considered a most appropriate offering to a variety of deities. The horse was not commonly ridden, however, and women who rode in daily life were more likely to use a donkey. The status of the rider as a goddess may have permitted her to be depicted on a horse; but who was the goddess, and why was she depicted in this way? It is possible that she was associated or identified with aspects of various deities. Artemis is the most popular recipient of riders seated side-saddle, presumably because of her primary role as a mistress of animals. At the sanctuaries of other deities, however, it is not clear why this votive type was dedicated. For instance, the single dedication to Athena is unusual: it is the only example of a rider seated side-saddle dedicated at an Athena sanctuary. The sanctuary at Tegea was originally one in honour of a fertility goddess and mistress of animals named Alea, who became associated with Athena.89 There are marked indications, however, that from the eighth century BC this goddess also possessed properties of a protectress, as shown by the votive 'Dipylon' shields, arrowheads, and spears.90 This sanctuary may reflect a transitional stage in the evolution of Athena, from the Bronze Age to the Iron Age. The bronze rider dedicated at this site appears to have been offered to a local precursor to Athena, presumably because of the deity's early traits as a mistress of animals and fertility. As Alea became increasingly linked to the standard protectress of the city (Athena), no additional dedications of riders seated side-saddle were made to her. The pattern of the distribution of the Archaic riders indicates that the type eventually became more closely linked with Artemis in particular, but occasionally also with Helen and Hera. In all cases, the deities in question have ancient roots which may go back to the Late Bronze Age. Numerous deities were worshipped in connection with horses, including Poseidon, Artemis, Athena, Hera, and Demeter.91 The manifestations of worship of these deities in their capacity as Hippia or Hippios, or in association with horses, varied greatly and were not limited to a particular iconographic image. The riders seated side-saddle, from their earliest appearance in Geometric times, may thus reflect an attempt to 7' E.

It is possible that the identity of the early riders may be connected with the region of Arcadia in particular. Schweitzer thinks that the West Arcadian cults, known from literary sources to be located at Phigaleia, Thelpousa, and Lykosoura, are significant. These cults involved the worship of Demeter and Poseidon (as Hippia or Hippios) and the offspring of these deities: a daughter, Despoina (or Soteira), and at Thelpousa a horse as well, named Arion. Schweitzer concludes that Arcadia preserved an ancient (Mycenaean) stratum of religious beliefs, from which, he believes, the connection between a goddess and a horse was derived. He argues that, since the later terracotta riders were clearly connected with Artemis and the most common Artemis cult in the Peloponnese was that of Artemis Soteira, the Arcadian 'Soteira' later became Artemis Soteira in the Pelopon- nese. He thus identifies Artemis (Soteira) as the deity depicted in the Geometric and Archaic images.92 Schweitzer's suggestion that the riders were connected to the Demeter-Despoina cults of Arcadia requires further examination. Jost, in her work on Arcadian cults and sanctuaries, also discusses a very ancient cult, later connected with Demeter, which existed at Phigaleia, Thelpousa, and Lykosoura. She maintains that the legendary accounts of the mating between an ancient earth goddess and Poseidon (Hippios) are independent and ancestral to the Eleusinian version (which has Demeter mating with Zeus). The offspring in the Arcadian account are Despoina (Mistress) and sometimes the horse, Arion. The daughter of the union is also called Soteira (Saviour) by the Arcadians (instead of Kore), according to Pausanias (viii. 31. I). In addition, Jost notes that Despoina is linked with Artemis in the traits they share, such as the practice of ritual dance in their cults and their ties to the animal world. She suggests that the links between Despoina and Artemis are older than the connection between Despoina and Demeter.93 Clearly, Schweitzer's and Jost's analyses of the literary evidence suggest that there was a significant link between Despoina/Artemis/Soteira and the horse. The antiquity of the (Arcadian) Demeter and Poseidon cult, moreover, is attested by a fundamental similarity to related Indo-European stories.94 The introduction of the horse into the Aegean from the East in the Middle Bronze Age, and the Indo-European source for the horse's name and its mythical associations (discussed above), further support the antiquity of this cult. The earliest representations of the bronze riders at Tegea and Lousoi may therefore reflect the preservation of a memory of this ancient cult in various parts of Arcadia. It is necessary, however, to examine the archaeological record for related evidence of unusual cults in this region. At Lykosoura, the only one of the above-mentioned West Arcadian sites to be excavated, the sanctuary of Despoina yielded many illustrations of animal-headed human figures. Though they date many centuries after the dedication of the riders seated side-saddle, they may reflect the preservation of an ancient ritual connected with Despoina.95 In central Arcadia, at Petrovouni, a remote sanctuary site probably sacred to Poseidon Hippios, a bronze group was found depicting four dancing, ithyphallic male figures with horses' heads. This bronze is roughly contemporary with the 92 Schweitzer 156-9. Zimmermann (n. 6), 11o, supports Schweitzer's general conclusions regarding the signifi- cance of the rider in Arcadia and the connections between females and horses in Arcadian cult. 93Jost (n. 89), 301-17; 333-5. 9' Langdon (n. 50), 199-200. 95Jost (n. 89), 332-3.</page><page sequence="19">VOTIVE SIDE-SADDLE RIDERS AT EARLY GREEK SANCTUARIES 277 bronze riders seated side-saddle, and may reflect an early expression of the Poseidon- Demeter-horse cult in the heart of the region.96 From Tegea, a Geometric bronze disc, probably of local manufacture, depicts a female standing on a quadruped and holding a poppy in her hand - explicit qualities of a mistress of animals and goddess of fertility. In addition, numerous bronze pomegranate pendants were offered to the deity at Tegea; the pomegranate also has a clear association with fertility and is an attribute of Demeter.97 There is Late Bronze Age and Dark Age evidence from Tegea indicating that the cult was ancient and conceivably derived from a Mycenaean goddess of fertility and nature.98 Despoina/Soteira was the mistress of the underworld and was connected with life after death generally; these same qualities have already been discussed as being attributable to the Bronze Age rider figurines, which were found primarily in tombs. It is thus conceivable that the Geometric riders reflect the survival in Arcadia of a memory of a Mycenaean mistress of fertility, vegetation, and wild nature connected with horses, who retained a local significance. It is not surprising that the riders became especially connected with Artemis, the supreme mistress of animals, who also possessed the traits of a goddess of wild nature and fertility.99 The evidence, however, does not show any special connection between the Demeter/Despoina cult and Artemis Soteira in particular, as Schweitzer had proposed. Artemis' suitability as the most appropriate recipient of this type of votive in the Archaic period continues to be seen at the sanctuary of Artemis Orthia at Sparta, where numerous later depictions of goddesses with horses in various poses in lead, clay, and ivory were dedicated. Images of a female figure between two horses' heads are common (FIGS. I3-14).100 Helen, who was worshipped at the Menelaion, may also have come under the influence of the neighbouring Artemis Orthia cult. It is likely that the close proximity of the Menelaion to the much larger Artemis Orthia sanctuary resulted in the dedication of riders to Helen. CONCLUSIONS The importance of the eighth-century riders seated side-saddle is attested by the place they occupy in the long history of representation of the type from the Bronze Age to the late Archaic period. At the early end of the sequence, the Minoan riders depicted on seals are likely to have been derived from Eastern counterparts that were probably meant to represent a deity seated side-saddle on a fantastic animal. Unlike them, the Minoan riders are exclusively female, ride bareback, and feature the local attributes of upraised arms and a flounced skirt. The Minoan image was incorporated into the Mycenaean repertoire in "' F. Hiller von Gaertringen and H.

In the thirteenth and twelfth centuries there are additional depictions of riders; they are in terracotta and the quadruped is a horse. The high status of the horse in Late Bronze Age society is important for understanding the depictions of the female riders. The Linear B tablet from Pylos mentioning a 'mistress of the horse' may serve to identify the rider. It is conceivable that even the images of fantastic animals were meant to portray horses, as was common in other Indo-European cultures. The exact function of the riders in the Bronze Age contexts is unclear, though their placement in tombs may reveal a connection with life after death. The rider may have been a goddess of fertility, an association common amongst Indo-European-speaking peoples. When the image reappeared in the eighth century, it was at sanctuaries of three different deities: Artemis, Athena, and Hera. The two bronzes offered to Artemis at Lousoi reflect the beginning of relative popularity for this type of dedication at Artemis sanctuaries, perhaps because of Artemis' clear role as a Potnia Theron or Mistress of Animals. The dedication to Athena at Tegea, on the other hand, may in fact have been offered to her precursor, Alea, who herself had aspects of a mistress of animals and fertility. In the case of the bronze riders dedicated to Hera, the recipient deity at Olympia remains open (see n. 84); the bronze from the Heraion at Samos is only tangentially related to the others, since it has strong Caucasian traits in details of both appearance and iconography. From these few surviving examples, therefore, it is clear that bronze riders reappeared primarily at sanctuaries in the Peloponnese, with a concentration in Arcadia, and with some ambiguity regarding the identity of the recipients. The significance of the eighth-century examples is both temporal and geographical. They mark the reintroduction of the type into the Greek artistic and religious repertoire. The limited evidence indicates that the image was generally found at relatively remote sanctuary sites, where it was produced in a very simple style and offered to the local female deity. It is likely that a memory of an ancient goddess associated with a horse had been preserved at some of the first Greek sanctuary sites in Arcadia. This study suggests that the rider from Olympia was commissioned and dedicated by an Arcadian who understood its significance. The identity of this deity is associated with the Arcadian Despoina cults, which seem to preserve ancient elements of worship. Evidence for later cults in isolated areas of Arcadia, in the west and south-west of the region, may reflect memories of a goddess ancestral to Demeter who mated with a horse-god, Poseidon, and gave birth to a daughter called Despoina or Soteira, and in some versions a horse. It is conceivable that the eighth-century sanctuaries in more accessible parts of Arcadia (Tegea, Lousoi) also retained memories of this ancient cult and expressed aspects of it in a tangible form from this early period. The eighth-century bronze group of horse-headed figures from the sanctuary of Poseidon Hippios in central Arcadia, and certain bronzes from Tegea and Lousoi, support such a view. The bronze riders may thus be linked in a general way to Despoina, the mistress of the underworld, who was a fertility goddess intimately connected with horses. At the other end of the sequence, the later terracotta examples reflect strong connections with Artemis, who was herself a mistress of animals and fertility. As the popularity of the type grew in the Archaic period, the image of the rider seated side-saddle was occasionally offered to other goddesses (Hera, Helen) who may have possessed some of the same traits. The type remained concentrated at Artemis sanctuaries in the Peloponnese, however, throughout the Archaic period. It is thus possible that the eighth-century BC Greek riders reflect a memory of an</page><page sequence="21">VOTIVE SIDE-SADDLE RIDERS AT EARLY GREEK SANCTUARIES 279 iconographic type derived from the Bronze Age and preserved in Arcadia. Arcadia (like Cyprus) served as a place where Mycenaean refugees fled at the end of the Bronze Age, and had conditions that allowed older elements of language and culture to be preserved. The elusive connections between the Bronze Age and Iron Age female riders may thus be found in the cults and sanctuaries of Arcadia, where there are many clues to illuminate the significance of this unusual votive offering.
