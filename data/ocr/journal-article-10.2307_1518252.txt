<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST 247 Geschichtswerkes". Kaiser has kept abreast of recent publications and has sought to take new ideas into consideration. This new edition may be warmly commended to O.T. scholars. [J.A.E.] W. C. KAISER, Toward Old Testament Ethics. xiv + 346 pp. Academie Books, Zondervan, Grand Rapids, 1983. Inevitably more comprehensive than ex- haustive, Kaiser's volume deals with numerous texts and numerous facets of O.T. ethics in mainly short sections and chapters. Discussion of such previous contributions as there have been is included in Part I ("Definition and Method"). The problem of finding a central organizing principle being much the same as is encountered in the quest for a "centre" in O.T. theology, Kaiser opts for a "combination approach" that includes "elements of the synchronic, diachronic, central theme approach along with exegetical studies of summariz- ing texts and apologetical analysis of key moral difficulties in the canon" (p. 21). The use of the word "apologetical" here serves as a kind of trailer for Part IV ("Moral Difficulties in the Old Testament") where the apologetical endeavour to acquit God of serious charges tends towards what seems to the reviewer to be forced exegesis of some of the problem texts. Part II ("Sum- marizing Moral Texts in Old Testament Ethics") deals with the Decalogue, the Book of the Covenant, the Holiness Code and the Deuteronomic laws (follow- ing W. Schultz and S. Kaufman, he divides these last into sections correspon- ding to each constituent part of the Decalogue). Part III ("Content of Old Testament Ethics") is holiness-orientated ("Holiness in the Family and Socie- ty", "Holiness in Wealth and Possessions", etc.). Part V consists of a single chapter, which treats of the relationship of the N.T. and of the Christian believer to the law of the O.T. Kaiser writes clearly and informedly and, it would seem, particularly with the conservative Christian student and pastor in mind. Others, while benefiting from many of his insights and observations, will regret that he makes so few concessions to critical O.T. scholarship. [R. P. GORDON] O. KEEL (ed.), Monotheismus im alten Israel und seiner Umwelt. Biblische Beitrage 14. 193 pp. Verlag Schweizerisches Katholisches Bibelwerk, and Benziger Verlag, Einsiedeln, 1980. This book contains discussions of polytheism and henotheism in the religion of Ebla by G. Pettinato, the question whether there was monotheism in Mesopotamia by B. Hartmann, monotheism in pharaonic Egypt by E. Horung, God and the gods at the beginning of biblical religion by H.-P. Miiller, and monotheism in Israel by F. Stolz. An introduction is con- tributed by O. Keel. It is useful to have this collection of essays on a topic which, in spite of its importance in the study of the O.T., has been strangely neglected. Some of Pettinato's comments on Ebla need to be treated with cau- tion. [John DAY] H. A. KENIK, Design for Kingship. The Deuteronomistic Narrative Technique in 1 Kings 3:4-15. SBL Dissertation Series 69. viii + 249 pp. Scholars Press, Chico, 1983. $13.50; $9 for members. This dissertation was completed at St Louis Universi- ty in 1978 and has not been revised for publication despite the appearance meanwhile of a number of pertinent studies. It comprises a detailed analysis of the structure and, in particular, of the phraseology of the account of Solomon's dream at Gibeon. It is suggested that the Deuteronomic Historian compiled the passage as a unity from traditional elements derived from early Yahwism and other sources known in royal circles in order to present his ideal of kingship. It is not "historical" in any sense. Furthermore, the passage is to be set alongside other compositions of the Deuteronomist which, according to M. Noth, marked major transitions in the history as a whole. It may be wondered whether short phrases, and even single common words, have not been over-interpreted as be-</page><page sequence="2">248 BOOK LIST ing by themselves the vehicles for major theological or institutional traditions and motifs. It is also surprising that no detailed comparison is undertaken with the law of the king in Deut. xvii 14-20. Moreover, the English style of the author is often bizarre (e.g. "enfleshed", p. 43; "vehiculed", p. 45; the use of "adumbrating" with the apparent meaning of "damaging", p. 49; "capsuliz- ed", p. 203). Nevertheless, she has succeeded in drawing attention to an im- portant passage in the DtrH and in suggesting a fresh appreciation of its literary function in the composition as a whole. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] M. L. KLEIN, Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopathisms in the Targumim of the Pentateuch, with Parallel Citations from the Septuagint. xxvi (English) + 176 (Hebrew) pp. Makor Publishing Ltd, Jerusalem, 1982. It is frequently stated as a generalization that the Targumim avoid or tone down anthropomorphisms. In his doctoral dissertation, presented in 1978 to the Hebrew University and here published with the provision of an index of references and an up-to-date bibliography, Klein examines the origins and moder expressions of this view before subjecting it to analysis and common-sense criticism. It is shown that the Targumim are in no way consistent in their translations, and that more often than not we must reckon with general translation equivalents rather than specifically anti-anthropomorphic renderings. Amongst other relevant topics covered we should note here, in view of various recent publications, the salutary remarks about the inconsistent use of memra' in the Targumim. Instead of an English summary, two of Klein's articles in English (SVT 32 [1981], pp. 162-77, andJTS, N.S. 30 [1979], pp. 502-7) are included. Between them, they discuss in brief compass most of the areas covered by the dissertation, but not, we may note, the rendering of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic verbs at- tributed to God, where Klein's generally convincing thesis is most open to criticism. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] R. W. KLEIN, 1 Samuel. Word Biblical Commentary 10. xxxiv + 307 pp. Word Books, Waco, Texas, 1983. After a list of abbreviations, a general bibliography, and an introduction of little more than twelve pages, the com- mentary follows the usual pattern of the series, and there are indexes of authors, principal subjects, and biblical references, but unfortunately no maps. Klein is well informed and writes clearly, and the commentary is generally helpful and, among other things, takes textual evidence from Qumran into con- sideration. The reader would sometimes have welcomed more information (e.g. a discussion of the phrase "Yahweh of hosts" in i 3, and the meaning of miptan in v 4-5, and a fuller discussion of "seer" and "prophet" in ix 9 and of the im- plications of the command to "serve other gods" in xxvi 19), and sometimes references are made to philological matters and cognate languages without stating precisely what the relevant information is (pp. 32, 50, 175; cp. p. 232). One wonders whether the author was allowed enough space to meet the needs of exegesis. The commentary is readable, though there are places where the English is in need of polish or even correction (e.g. "decimation" seems to be used as a synonym of "massacre" on pp. 27, 108, and "transpired" as a synonym of "happened" on p. 224; "data... is", p. 35; "Saul was very angry with Michal, as he would be with Jonathan, his other son", p. 198; Jonathan is described as "presumptive heir" of Saul on pp. 199, 210-or is the phrase in- tended to have a different meaning from "heir presumptive"?). Notwithstan- ding such blemishes, the commentary deserves to be widely used. J.A.E.] G. A. F. KNIGHT, Servant Theology. A Commentary on the Book of Isaiah 40-55.
