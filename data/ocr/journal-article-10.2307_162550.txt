Hourani ISLAMIC AND NON-ISLAMIC ORIGINS OF MU'TAZILITE ETHICAL RATIONALISMI The ethical theory of the Mu'tazila is properly called 'rationalism', because it held that the values of human and divine actions are knowable in principle by natural human reason. Since this doctrine and related parts of the theory (men- tioned in the next section) were the prevailing ethical theories in the major pre- Islamic religious cultures of Iran and Byzantium, the question easily arises, to what extent were the Mu'tazila as the first systematic theologians in Islam indebted to these cultures for their ethics? This question is part of a wider one, that of the origins of systematic theology in Islam (kaldm) as a whole. In order to provide a context for my inquiry into the origins of the ethical system, it will be useful to begin with a brief review of the conclusions of scholars on the origins of kaldm. Perhaps it was Maimonides who, more than anyone else, set the tone for early modern views in a famous passage of his Guide of the Perplexed: Know also that all the statements that the men of Islam - both the Mu'tazila and the Ash'ariyya - have made concerning these notions are all of them opinions founded upon premises that are taken over from the books of the Greeks and the Syrians who wished to disagree with the opinions of the philosophers and to reject their statements [after those two nations became Christian].... When thereupon the community of Islam arrived and the books of the philosophers were transmitted to it, then were also transmitted to it those refutations composed against the books of the philosophers. Thus they found the kalam of John Philoponus, of Ibn 'Adi, and of others [and used them for their own purposes].2 The nucleus of the present article was a paper delivered at the sixth annual conference of the Middle East Studies Association, in the plenary session held in honor of Gustave E. von Grunebaum on 4 November 1972. Von Grunebaum published two articles of characteristic breadth and richness on topics related to our problem: 'The Concept and Function of Reason in Islamic Ethics', Oriens, xv (1962), pp. I-I7, and 'The Sources of Islamic Civilization', Der Islam, vol. LVI (1970), pp. 1-54, also in The Cambridge History of Islam (Cambridge, 1970), vol. II, pp. 469-510. 2 Daldldt al-.Hd'irin, ed. S. Munk and I.

Hourani The importance of John Philoponus as a source for Islamic kaldm has been demonstrated by Herbert Davidson.' But Maimonides is undoubtedly exag- gerating when he claims that all kaldm arguments are derived from the pre- Islamic sources mentioned. The weight of his authority is reduced considerably when we realize that he had a strong aversion to the mutakallimun, shown throughout the Guide; that he was writing more than four centuries after the beginning of kaldm, when rather less was known about it than we know today; and that he makes a chronological blunder in the passage quoted when he puts this beginning of kaldm later than the translations from Greek philosophy and even than the lifetime of Yahya ibn 'Adi (d. 974). Many of the older scholars of the twentieth century, while not going as far as Maimonides, emphasized the influence of Greek philosophy and Christian theology on early kaldm. Michel Allard, in a valuable survey of orientalists' opinions on this question, suggests that their motives for seeking these connec- tions may have been a desire to explain obscure Arabic texts in the light of more coherent ancestors, and to see what changes Muslim theologians brought about.2 However that may be (and it is always risky to attribute motives), Allard is on sure ground in pointing out some difficulties in these views, and he sums up their major weakness by saying that 'their authors do not explain adequately the concrete conditions in which these influences were exercised'.3 He then surveys the more cautious approach of recent scholars, such as W. M. Watt and 0. Pretzl, leading to more reserved conclusions about non-Islamic influences, and he finds similar conclusions being drawn independently about other fields of early Islamic learning, such as law and grammar. The study of Mu'tazilite origins has until now been incidental or fragmentary, amounting to a few pages at most out of a treatment of some larger subject. It deserves a monograph, in which the possible influences on each topic of theology would be carefully estimated on the basis of all available evidence, and some general conclusions would be drawn from comparison of the results on the separate topics. What is attempted here is a beginning on one topic: a study of origins concerning Mu'tazilite ethics only. It is undertaken in full awareness of limitations due to the author's lack of specialized knowledge in some of the cultures involved, the scarcity of evidence, and the absence of cumulative indi- cations that a study of all the topics of theology together would provide. But it is hoped that others will make studies of the same kind on other topics of Mu'tazi- lite theology, until finally a solid basis will have been laid for broad conclusions.

Nonetheless it is possible to state five main points which were con- stant in the school, and which provide a manageable starting place for our inquiry. I. Values are objective. Good and evil, just and unjust are descriptive charac- ters of reality which are no less 'there' in things than their other qualities such as shape and size or mental qualities.' 2. There is one God, the only divine Creator. He knows all good and evil. He wishes and commands only good for men, but He allows them to do evil and to disobey His commands. 3. The values of many things and acts are known rationally by men. This knowledge does not come through sense perception alone but through the intellect, after we are informed of the relevant facts. A consequence of this rationalism is that people without a revelation are able to make sound ethical judgments to a certain extent. 4. Man has power to act as well as to know values, and so he is responsible for his just and unjust acts. 5. God rewards the just and punishes the unjust in an everlasting afterlife, and He does so justly because of man's full responsibility as mentioned in points 3 and 4. Did these ideas come to the minds of the first school of theology in Islam from within the intellectual resources of early Islam, that is to say, from less explicit ideas suggested in the Qur'an, the Traditions, and/or the earliest Muslim indivi- dual thinkers such as al-Hasan al-Basri? Or did they come directly from one or more of the older religious or philosophical cultures without any previous Islamic filter? Such a formulation of questions already achieves a certain progress in defining as 'Islamic' anything that is mediated through the earliest sources of Islam, regardless of whether these had originally drawn upon non-Islamic sources. But two problems call for brief discussion. The first is in regard to this definition. It may seem arbitrary to call 'Islamic' any idea that comes through an early Muslim before the Mu'tazila, for al-Hasan al-Basri and even his predecessors may already have been receiving non-Islamic ideas. But at about this point, as we look back into past time, the sources recede into an inarticulate, almost indiscernible past, and in order to pose answerable questions we must set this conventional rule: Whatever a Mu'tazili took directly from another MIuslim or whatever he thought out for himself is Islamic, at that stage. I For the present purpose we can leave aside the Mu'tazilite definitions of value terms, e.g. of 'evil' as blameworthy, etc. These were probably constructed later. For the developed theory see G. F. Hourani, Islamic Rationalism: The Ethics of 'Abd al-Jabbdr (Oxford, 1971).</page><page sequence="4">62 George F. Hourani The second problem arises from the oversimplified formulation of the questions at the beginning of this section. They are defective in demanding yes/no answers which cannot contain the complexity of historical reality. To move one step away from simplicity, some of the five points may be Islamic in origin, others non- Islamic. Then to move another step, some of the five may be more Islamic, others less Islamic, for within each one there may be combinations of sources resulting from several influences playing on one or more minds, and the receiving minds may - almost must - themselves change what they receive. We have to think in terms of transmissions with multiple termini at both ends; that is, with several donors and several recipients; and of transformation by recipients through more or less conscious fusion with ideas from other sources, including their own creative thoughts and those of contemporary associates and adversaries. Our questions should therefore be refined thus: to what extent did the earliest Mu'tazila derive their ethical system from Islamic and non-Islamic sources, and how much of the main points did they derive from each source? This is about as precise as we should be, and even with an amount of deliberate vagueness in the questions we must not expect more than probable answers because of the deficiency of historical evidence. III At first glance, a non-Islamic origin for Mu'tazilite ethics appears to be favored by the fact that the main opposing view is so strongly Islamic in its claims and tone.' This is the traditional ethics that soon became dominant among Sunni jurists and theologians, from Malik to al-Shafi'i, Ibn Hanbal, al-Ash'ari, and all their disciples. It agrees with the Mu'tazila only on the unity of God; apart from that, the theory differs sharply from theirs on all five points. I. Values are not objective in a sense that is prior to God; they are created by His will. 2. God can wish good or evil for men, according to His unrestricted will and power. 3. Man can know values only by revelation directly, or by reasoning dependent on the data of revelation, but never by any process of reason independent of revelation. I This argument was used by C. H. Becker, 'Christliche Polemik und Islamische Dogmenbildung', first published in 9i i and reprinted in his Islamstudien (Leipzig, 1924), I, 432-49. Supporting a Christian origin for the Mu'tazilite view of human qadar, he wrote: 'Certainly the opponents on both sides could later prove their opinions with Qur'an quotations, but the contest over the whole question is yet in the first place imported into Islam; for John of Damascus [who has been shown to be well informed about early Islam] indicates determinism as absolutely the Islamic doctrine, with which he contrasts free will [to autoexousion] as the specifically Christian doctrine' (p. 439, my translation.) Allard (op. cit. pp. I6o-I) notes the weakness of this argument. But Becker gives other evidence; see below, section viii, on Christian theology.</page><page sequence="5">Islamic and non-Islamlic origins of Mu'tazilite ethical rationalism 63 4. God has power over all man's choices and acts, and ultimately predestines their direction by giving or withholding His grace. 5. Whatever God decides is just, because He decides it as the Lord and not because it conforms with standards of 'justice' thought out by human reason. This theory arose from strong currents in primitive Islam. But to conclude that its Mu'tazilite opponents were therefore deviators from Islam in their own times would be to judge them from a false perspective of later history; and to go further and infer a non-Islamic origin of their doctrines would be unwarranted on the basis of their minority status alone. To find more solid arguments for a non-Islamic origin we shall have to look for features of Mu'tazilite thought in the religious and philosophical systems of the preceding and surrounding non-Muslim cultures. But general resemblances will not be enough. Before proceeding to particulars it will be useful to reflect briefly on methods and criteria for establishing historical truth in matters of intellectual transmission. To reach an adequate proof of affiliation of ideas, an intellectual historian needs one or both of two kinds of evidence: (i) external evidence of affiliation; for example, a report of a biographer that one scholar was taught by another or was favorably impressed by his works; (ii) detailed resemblances so close that they could not be accidental; for example, exact correspondence of sentences, or numerous correspondences in technical terms. No precise rules can be set. Combinations of external evidence with several general resemblances may give conclusions of various degrees of probability. But it may happen that there is little external evidence and only general resemblances. This is the case with Mu'tazilite origins. The background of the school before Wasil's foundation of it is almost prehistoric, in the proper sense of being unrecorded in writing, and we know little enough of him and his con- temporaries. From the nature of the situation, they would not express any intellectual debt they owed to non-Muslim sources. Consequently we have to rely heavily on circumstantial evidence, and this will produce probable hypotheses at most. In considering possible non-Islamic sources of influence we can quickly eliminate two bodies of thought. One is Arabian paganism. Most of the Mu'tazila were not Arabians, so they would have learned nothing of the Arabian tradition through their families. Any influence it had on them must have been filtered through the Qur'an and Traditions, so that it is not to be counted as non-Islamic, according to the criterion set up previously. The other possible source is Judaism. This was a developed system of religious thought, which may have had some influence on the origins of other Islamic sciences such as grammar and history, but of which no traces have yet been found in early Islamic theology, so far as I know. This leaves four systems with which Muslims had substantial contacts:</page><page sequence="6">64 George F. Hourani Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism, Christianity and Greek philosophy. These four will be examined in turn. Finally, the background of Mu'tazilism within Islam itself will be considered, and some general conclusions will be drawn. IV To provide a context for the case of Zoroastrianism, it will be useful to give here a broad survey of the historical encounter of Zoroastrians and Muslims in the first three centuries of Islam. To begin with their political and social relations, it should be remembered that the Zoroastrian religion in its straight dualist form, with its supreme gods Ohrmazd and Ahriman,I had been the orthodox faith of Sassanid Iran, supported by the Shah, and consequently by the civil service, army, and dihqdns. Its priests, the m6beds, had been almost an arm of the govern- ment and had shown little independence or intellectual vitality under that regime. Its flocks were large, containing the mass of Iranian townsmen and peasants, who no doubt accepted the religion with more or less enthusiasm in proportion to their appreciation of its wholesome and positive teaching and their pride in the power and glory of their national empire. There was no missionary activity because this was a national religion that was exclusive of non-Iranians. In spite of its long survival, such a religion rested largely on the precarious foundation of support by the state, which could lead it to collapse in face of one of the more vigorous new world religions, endowed with believers ready to proselytize and if necessary to accept martyrdom. The Manichaeans in the Sassanid empire had been held down by persecution; the Christians too, at times, yet the Nestorian church had gained numerous adherents, especially in Aramaic-speaking 'Iraq. But the Arab Muslims came in with an army as well as a faith and destroyed the Sassanid state. The dihqdns were then mostly won over to Islam by economic policies which allowed them to retain their lands and tax- collecting privileges on condition of conversion.2 This double loss of political and economic support left the mobeds and the people to struggle as best they could for the continuation of their old religion. In the circumstances they were fighting a losing contest. But it took several centuries before Zoroastrianism became negligible in Iran. The first emigration of Zoroastrians to Gujerat and Bombay occurred in 717.3 Islamic heresies with roots in one or another branch of Zoroastrianism appeared in the form of popular revolts in Iran under the earlier 'Abbasid caliphs, such as I Distinguished thus from the Zurvan heresy, with its more ultimate source of the two gods, Zurvan or Infinite Time.

Maziyar in the ninth century and Mardavij in the tenth attempted without success to recreate Zoroastrian states in Tabaristan. Quite large Zoroastrian populations held out in the mountain areas of northern and western Iran, as well as in Fars, Yazd, and KirmAn, into the ninth century' and even the tenth.2 It should not be thought, however, that the struggle between Muslims and Zoroastrians was conducted entirely on the political level. There were also intellectual encounters, and it is these that concern our subject more directly. Most of the surviving sources for our knowledge of Zoroastrianism date from the Islamic period: the Denkart and other Pahlavi books, and the Arabic writings on heresies.3 But it is certain that the doctrines found in them had been formu- lated under the Sassanid dynasty. The first Muslims who came into 'Iraq and Iran therefore faced a pre-existing developed religion. And this religion, although by now less vital than it had been, presented an intellectual challenge to them because it was new to them in a sense that Christianity and Judaism were not. For the Qur'an itself had prepared some answers and attitudes to the Christians and Jews but had barely mentioned the religions of Iran.4 It was thus a task for the first Muslim theologians to take up this challenge, and particularly to refute the prevailing dualist position of the Zoroastrians. The Mu'tazila were the pre- dominant early theologians, and nearly all of them were born and lived in 'Iraq or Iran; many were mawali, converts or sons of converts.5 They did not ignore the challenge, and there is evidence of early debates.

From de Menasce and Monnot we may expect fresh light on the relations of these religions with Islam. The former has completed a French translation of the surviving portions of the Denkart, the latter is preparing a book, 'La r6futation des dualistes et des mages par 'Abd al-Jabbar et ses predecesseurs musulmans'. al-thanazviyya, 'dualists', in medieval Arabic texts usually refers to the Manichaeans not the Zoroastrians. 4 Qur'an, xxii, 17, mentions the Magians (al-Majuis), without clarifying the attitude to be taken by Muslims toward them. 5 Individual origins of the Mu'tazila in A. Nader, Le systeme philosophique des Mu'tazila (Beirut, 1956), pp. I6-46, and in biographies in the Encyclopaedia of Islam, New Edition (= EI2) (Leiden, i96o-). A historical problem that deserves attention is why the former Byzantine provinces of Syria and Egypt ceased to be active centers of intellectual life after the Islamic conquest and were so soon overtaken by 'Iraq and Iran, both of which under the Sassanids had been undistinguished on the world scene of the sciences. Did the Islamic caliphate do something to deaden eastern Mediterranean culture and to bring 'Iraq and Iran to new life? Whatever the explanations, the fact is undeniable and applies to law, literature, historiography, theology, and even the secular sciences and philosophy with their strongly Hellenistic bases and traditions.</page><page sequence="8">66 George F. Houtrani ment, debated with Zoroastrians, Manichaeans, and others, and is said to have converted more than 3,000 men to Islam.' Misa al-Aswari (d. c. 816) taught Qur'an interpretation (probably in al-Basra) and 'used to set the Arabs on one side and the mawalt on the other, and explain to each group in their own language '.2 v To estimate the probable influence of Zoroastrian on Mu'tazilite ethics in this his- torical situation, we have next to compare the two systems. This may be done most effectively for our purpose by setting them side by side in their barest elements. Zoroastrian ethics3 Mu'tazilite ethics I. Objective values Objective values 2. Ohrmazd and Ahriman, sources Allah, source of good alone of good and evil 3. Rational knowledge of values Rational knowledge of values 4. Man's power Man's power, source of evil 5. Everlasting rewards, Everlasting rewards and purgative punishments punishments The resemblances between these two systems are impressive at first sight, and combined with the eastern origins and environment of most of the Mu'tazila they can lead to a spontaneous conclusion that these Muslim theologians took over most of their ethical theory from their Zoroastrian predecessors. Such a conclusion was indeed drawn by opponents at a very early stage, before the Mu'tazila had systematized their doctrine but when their first leaders or even their predecessors were known for their doctrine of qadar, human power to act. The accusation found its way into a Tradition, in which the Prophet is reported to have declared, 'The Qadariyya are the Mazdeans of this people'.4 But such accusations were commonly used to discredit opponents: the same one is found later in use against the Shi'a,5 and the Mu'tazila were sometimes charged with Ibn al-Murtada, Tabaqdt al-Mu'tazila: Die Klassen der Mu'taziliten ed. S. Diwald- Wilzer (Wiesbaden, I961), pp. 44-9. 2 Ibid. p. 60. The second language might have been Aramaic or Persian. If the latter, then we are witnessing here an aspect of the rise of modern Persian, since a Muslim theologian must have injected an extensive Arabic religious vocabulary into his Middle Persian lectures. A short argument between 'Amr ibn 'Ubayd (699-76I) and a Zoro- astrian is also recorded in a late source, Taftazani, Sharh 'ald al-'Aqi'id al-Nasafiyya (Cairo, I939), p. 99, Eng. trans. E. E.

For a Zoroastrian-Mu'tazilite influence there is, in fact, no direct evidence, either external or philological, known to me at present. It will therefore be necessary to fall back on estimates of the total situation. Let us return, then, to the comparison of the two theories. With all their resemblances, the dominant fact in the minds of the adherents of both systems at the time of their encounter was the unbridgeable gap between their positions on the second point. The Mu'tazila held to the basic doctrine of Islam, the unity of God, and could not admit the infringement on His divinity that would be constituted by a co-eternal being, original cause of the evils of the world, and not to be subdued by God's efforts until the final days. In spite of holding less extreme views on God's omnipotence than their traditionalist Muslim opponents, Mu'tazilite theologians emphasized His unity and uniqueness to the extent that tawhid was one of their watchwords. And we must not lose the full significance of this word by relating it only to inner disputes of Islam; in those days the Mu'tazila were missionaries of Islam against the eastern religions,2 and tawhid was their battle-cry against every form of dualism and polytheism. There was also disagreement with the dualists on the fourth point, following from the disagreement on the second: for Zoroastrians could relate evil in man (sin) to Ahriman in a causal manner, whereas the Mu'tazila refused to do that for the relation of man to God with respect to human sin. On the fifth point, it would have been convenient for Mu'tazilite ethics to have argued for the tempo- rary limits of punishments in the afterlife, but they were prevented from doing so by explicit teaching of the Qur'an that the punishment of wrongdoers is everlasting. Thus they had to find other arguments than purgatory to support their theodicy. On top of these differences, there were others beyond ethics which need not be mentioned. At the basis of all, and making any compromise with Zoroastrian doctrines impossible, was the fundamental divergence about the source of religious authority, between the followers of the Avesta and those of the Qur'an. The central disagreement, on the cause of moral evil, may be illustrated briefly from two controversial writings which survive. On the Zoroastrian side we have a Pahlavi book of the mid-ninth century by Mardan Farrukh, the Skand Gumanik Vidcr,3 which includes arguments against the Mu'tazila as well as against traditional Islam. On the Mu'tazilite side, late in the tenth century 'Abd al- Jabbar wrote the fifth part of his al-Mughni, dealing with non-Islamic sects.4 I See below, section viii, p. 70, n.

Houirani These two theologians do not address each other directly, but they are familiar enough with the positions of their adversaries to enable us to draw from them the main elements of the disagreement between the two groups on the problem of evil. The Zoroastrian knows that the Mu'tazila would not accept to make God the cause of moral evil in man or allow Him to be defective in any way. He therefore has to attack the Mu'tazilite view that man alone, not Ahriman, is the cause of such evil. His argument is that if the devil is excluded as a cause, man's doing evil is impossible to explain without imputing a defect to God. For either God would be ignorant or impotent to prevent the evil, which makes Him defective in knowledge or power, or else He would be wise and able to prevent it but unwilling, in which case He would be lacking in goodness and mercy. But if one believes with orthodox Zoroastrians that there is a devil who is uncreated, independent of God in his actions and evil by essence, then it is impossible for God to prevent him from showing ill will and doing evil, and he is the prime cause of human evildoing. God's omnipotence does not extend to the impossible, so no defect is now imputed to Him. Nevertheless He will control the devil at the end. The Mu'tazili on his side argues that an uncreated devil is impossible, be- cause if he were uncreated the whole world might equally be so, and then both God and the devil would be unnecessary as causes of what exists. But if the devil is a creature of God, as Islam holds, the Zoroastrian argument collapses because, once it is admitted that God has created this most evil being without a defect in Himself, it can equally be admitted that He has directly created other beings who do evil, without a need for the devil as an intermediate creator. Thus the devil is not a necessary part of the world; he exists as a contingent fact, and he does not have the attributes and role ascribed to him by the Zoroastrians. Man chooses evil; he is tempted by the devil, but the devil is not a cause of his evil acts in the proper sense of 'cause', as when we refer to natural causes. There are similar arguments concerning the punishments of the just in the next life. The Zoroastrian is at an advantage in his theodicy in being able to hold that all punishments of men in the afterlife are purgatorial and all men will end up in paradise. But there is no need to go further. The tone of debate between Zoroastrians and Mu'tazila is mild, compared with the far more severe opposition of Mardan to traditional Islam, or the severity of Mu'tazilite authors against the Manichaeans. Still, the Mu'tazila were nowhere near being close to the Zoro- astrians. They were of two different religions engaged in a life-struggle, and nothing could bring them into alliance or sympathy. For 'Abd al-Jabbar the Zoroastrian myths of creation were non-sensical tales (khurdfdt) which hardly deserved refutation. Does all this mean that the resemblances between Mu'tazilite and Zoro- astrian ethics are mere coincidences? No, there is probably influence; but the</page><page sequence="11">Islamic and non-Isla.nlic origins of Mu'tazilite ethical rationalism 69 relation is less definite than a take-over of specific doctrine from specific texts. Islam as a system of beliefs was still fluid, capable of being interpreted in different ways by different parties. The 'traditional' Islam, with its voluntaristic and pre- destinarian ethics, was not yet an orthodoxy and was in sharp contrast with the prevailing ethical beliefs of the eastern regions with their masses of Zoroastrian and recently converted subjects. It was natural that there would be another Muslim party that would take account of these beliefs, to the extent that they were not excluded by the evident meaning of the Qur'an. This party would then make a stronger appeal for conversion to surviving Zoroastrians and have a more attractive Islam with which to hold and indoctrinate converts. Thus the influence of Zoroastrianism would take the form of a pervasive pressure for accommodation to large numbers of people, both educated and illiterate, who formed an impor- tant part of the intellectual environment of the Mu'tazila at the period when they were constructing their theology. This explanation is a hypothesis; perhaps we shall never have texts to prove it, because the nature of the influence does not admit confinement to any specific texts. But the hypothesis will be strengthened by the accumulation of similar ones in relation to other sects to be examined. VI The Manichaeans had never been an established church in Iran or 'Iraq, and their numbers were always far fewer than those of the Zoroastrians. On the other hand they were missionaries for a new world religion, the last before Islam, and they seem to have penetrated intellectual circles in the cities of 'Iraq. There was an upsurge of Manichaean propaganda in Arabic before and after the 'Abba- sid revolution, led by 'Abdallah ibn al-Muqaffa', 'Abd al-Karim ibn Abi al-'Awja', and other prominent authors, according to later Arabic sources.' We cannot be sure about individuals, but at any rate enough alarm was aroused in Muslim circles by these zindiqs2 to stimulate the caliph al-Mahdi and some successors to combat them with official persecution, and to provoke refutations by Mu'taz- ilite theologians. The Manichaean position on ethics resembled that of the Zoroastrians in its general dualistic lines, but differed from it in important respects. The source of good was eternal Light, the source of evil eternal Darkness; and the good and I For an account of the leading figures, real or supposed, see G.

Hourani evil acts of men were caused in them by these two natural forces. These doctrines aroused sharper opposition from the Mu'tazila than Zoroastrianism had. Light and darkness were physical forces, thus making the Manichaeans ultimately materialists, however much they might disguise their doctrine in myths. As physical forces they could not be eternal and must be created, hence in need of a Creator above them, Himself eternal. There was no correspondence of light with good, of darkness with evil, for there are common situations in which light is harmful (for example, in helping criminals to find their victims) and others in which darkness is beneficial (for example, concealing the innocent from aggres- sors). Finally, the attribution of the good and evil acts of one man to the forces of light and darkness, working respectively in him, denies both the unity of the person - that it is the same person who does both good and evil - and his free- dom, since he has the power to act by choice, not by the compulsions of nature. These and other Mu'tazilite objections are gone over in detail in the two longest surviving refutations of Manichaeism in Arabic, by Qasim ibn Ibrahim' in the ninth century and 'Abd al-Jabbar2 in the tenth. Qasim reacts more passionately to Manichaean attacks on the Qur'an and Muhammad; 'Abd al-Jabbar's criti- cisms are more profound. From the hostility of the Mu'tazila to the Manichaeans we can conclude that they took nothing from Manichaean ethics, except probably some terms.3 It is also unlikely that they made any effort to accommodate their doctrines to attract Manichaeans, who as mentioned were not numerous. The main effort was directed to rescuing wavering minds from the temptations of this infidel religion. VII The situation of the Christians in the new empire of Islam differed from that of the Zoroastrians in several respects, most of which placed them in a stronger position in face of Islam than the Zoroastrians enjoyed. They were by far the majority of subjects in Syria and Egypt, and remained so for more centuries than the adherents of the eastern religions in 'Iraq and Iran. They maintained a presence in 'Iraq which was more important intellectually than their smaller population there would suggest. It is true that the Christians were divided into sects, Chalcedonian (Orthodox), Monophysite and Nestorian, and this division weakened them politically, but in the areas of controversy their division was on the issue of the nature of Christ, which had no bearing on the ethical questions that are being considered here. Two other political factors are more relevant. One is the survival of the I al-Radd 'ald al-Zindiq al-La'in Ibn al-Muqaffa': La lotta tra l'Islam e il Manicheismo, ed. and trans. M.

Close to the Christian provinces of the caliphate, just across the Mediterranean Sea and the Taurus Mountains, was the everlasting Christian state, heir to Rome, with its glorious capital the new Rome on the Bosporus. Christ had for a while cut off his servants in the East because of their sins and divisions, but He had not abandoned His larger flock in the West, and they would return to restore His reign when penance had been done. The proximity of Byzantium, and the hopes it aroused, certainly brought dangers from the inevitable reactions of Muslims, but on balance these factors gave confidence to the Christians under the Umayyad and early 'Abbasid governments. So long as they exercised tact in their dealings with their new rulers they would have the benefit of the protection and tolerance prescribed for peoples of the Book, which applied to them more clearly than to Zoroastrians. They were subject to social and economic discrimination which would in time bleed their communities, but such pressures would have their least effects on the clergy who conducted religious discussions with Muslims. The other political factor that favored the Christians more than the Zoro- astrians was that the Orthodox church had not been quite so heavily dependent on the state, and the Monophysite and Nestorian churches had had to maintain themselves against the state. Thus they were less liable to collapse when left to rely on themselves under Muslim rulers. In the sphere of polemics, both sides in the Christian-Muslim controversy were more confident in their intellectual stances than the parties in the dualist- Muslim controversies. Confidence on the Christian side was supported by the factors mentioned above and, on the theological level, by the high degree of sophistication that their leading preachers and authors had attained after so many centuries of debate with pagan Greek philosophers and other Christian theologians. If we can judge from early dialogues, which have survived only in Christian records, Christians were able to rebut their simple-minded adversaries by questions that they could not answer.' Muslims on their side were more confident in facing Christians because the Qur'an had already given them a few guidelines for debating with them. Their criticisms were directed mainly against the divinity of Christ and problems of the Trinity. See F.

Hou.rani VIII Before we attempt to answer our specific problem, the influence of Christian ethics on Mu'tazilite ethics, it is necessary to review at some length the more general question of influences of Christian theology on Mu'tazilite theology. Marked resemblances have long been noticed in several areas of theology: divine attributes, ethical principles, structure of treatises, methods of inter- pretation of scripture, and so on. Contemporary Muslim opponents of the Mu'tazila were the first to draw the inference of Christian influence, which in their eyes amounted to an accusation of heresy. This accusation was made early enough to get into the accepted collections of Traditions of the Prophet, in these sentences: 'Perhaps you will live long enough after me to meet people who will deny the power of God and ascribe sins to His servants. They [will] have drawn this argument of theirs from the Christians.I This Tradition contains an unmistakable reference to the early Qadariyya, who probably go back to a time before the first Mu'tazila but held the same beliefs on free will and human responsibility. The saying is, of course, without value as historical evidence of Christian influence; all it shows is that such an assertion was thought by some early traditional Muslim to be plausible and was expected to discredit the Qada- riyya among many Muslims. Thereafter, the sophistries of guilt by association were not unknown to the mutakallimuzn and were applied freely in associating opponents with non-Muslim doctrines.2 But if these medieval assertions prove nothing about causal connections, we must take more seriously the conclusions of many modern scholars relating the Mu'tazila to Christian theology. No doubt von Kremer was the first to do so,3 and he was followed by de Boer, Macdonald, Goldziher, Arnold, and most thoroughly by Becker in his influential article 'Christliche Polemik'.4 Becker's first argument on the question of qadar has already been mentioned: that because John of Damascus treated predestination as the characteristic doctrine of Islam, its Muslim opponents must have drawn their doctrine of qadar from a non- Muslim source.5 He then goes on to point out some similarities of the Christian and qadarite positions, which are not very striking. Next he quotes the Tradition given above, which proves nothing. On the question of creation of the Qur'an, he is able to show how the doctrine of the uncreated Qur'an would arise naturally I Quoted by Becker,' Christliche Polemik', p. 441, referring to' Ala' al-Din al-Muttaqi al-Hindi, Kanz al-'Ummal (Hyderabad?, 1894), I, 35, no. 652, and cf. p. 36, no. 668. 2 Some references in Allard, Probleme, pp. 153-6 (not limited to Mu'tazila and Chris- tians).

A similar argument follows, on the question of anthropomorphic attributes of God and the incar- nation of Christ. Then some emphatic statements on the Christian origin of the methods of kaldm, an argument that has been viewed more recently with skepticism by Gardet and Anawati in their classic study of Islamic theology.' The cumulative weight of so many resemblances should not be disregarded, and it must be held a reasonable hypothesis that Christian theology had some influence on Islamic theology. But no decisive proof can be expected unless more precise answers can be obtained to the questions, How, when and where? Prompted by awareness of this need, attempts have been made to answer such questions. They have generally focused on St John of Damascus (c. 675-750),2 so the arguments for his being the main link between the two systems will next be discussed. IX At first sight, John seems to combine sufficient elements to constitute a probable influence on the early Mu'tazila. There are many points of resemblance between his theology and theirs. He was educated in Damascus, the Umayyad capital, and lived there until around 730, in close contact with Muslim ruling circles. He knew Arabic and wrote something in it. He was familiar with the Qur'an and Islam and wrote a short manual in Greek for use by Christians in discussing religion with Muslims, the Dialogue between a Christian and a Saracen, as well as a sharp criticism of Islam in a chapter of his Heresies.3 Finally, he was Although they do not refer to Becker on this point, it will be instructive to quote the two passages side by side in translation: Becker, 'Christliche Polemik', p. 445: 'It is known that the whole method of the kaldm springs from Christianity. Whoever reads Islamic dogmatic writers and Christian patristics in turn is so convinced of the connection that he has no further need of detailed proof. They form a single world of thought.' L. Gardet and G. Anawati, Introduction a la theologie musulmane: Essai de theologie comparec (Paris, 1948), p. 206: 'Again we reserve our opinion on the question of possible sources, and we in no way believe that a very general correspondence in plans must necessarily lead to a conclusion of direct influence. In any case, the only common points are related to the order: (i) God in Himself (and His attributes); (2) God and His acts ad extra; (3) the economy of salvation (in one case Christology, in the other prophetology); and the outline thus traced is so normal for monotheistic theologies which have reached a certain level of elaboration, that it is no doubt as hard to prove a direct influence of [St John] the Damascene on the problematics of AbC al-Hudhayl as it seems to us idle, in spite of Asin, to see in the plan of the Iqtisdd [of al-Ghazali] the prime origin of the plan of the later Summas.' 2 E.g.

Hourani a contemporary of the first two of the Mu'tazila, Wasil ibn 'Ata' (699-748) and 'Amr ibn 'Ubayd (699-761), and a predecessor of Dirar ibn 'Amr (c. 728-815)' and Abu al-Hudhayl (c. 751-849), the founder of a more systematic Mu'tazilite theology. The argument has some weaknesses in its geography and chronology. Damas- cus was the political capital but not an important center of Islamic learning. Wasil and 'Amr lived in 'Iraq. So did Dirar, Abiu al-Hudhayl and the other Mu'tazila of the first 'Abbasid century; and they had no reason to visit Damascus after the 'Abbasids opened Baghdad as their capital (762). How would John's writings have reached them? For Wasil and 'Amr it is next to impossible, for reasons of chronology and language. John's main work, the Fountain of Knowledge, was completed in or after 743, and not in Damascus but at the monastery of Mar Saba, to the southeast of Jerusalem. Since it was written in Greek, it would have had to be translated into Arabic and brought to the attention of Wasil and 'Amr within a maximum period of seven years, even if we suppose that their Mu'tazilite position was not formed until the very end of their lives. The known Arabic writings of John are insufficient as a basis for Mu'tazilite theology. A use of John's works by Dirar is chronologically possible because of the sixty-five years' interval between the dates of their deaths; and for Abu al- Hudhayl the interval is a century. Still, the language barrier remains. The Fountain of Knowledge is not known to have been available in Arabic before the latter part of the ninth century,2 and they would not have read it in Greek, nor in Syriac (if there was a Syriac translation). There are also doubts related to these two theologians individually. Dirar's doctrine of predestination removes him further from the likelihood of influence by John than other Mu'tazilis. Abu al-Hudhayl's life-span is rather late to make a predominant influence by John probable, in the light of the extent of theological development already found in his most direct Muslim predecessors, Wasil, 'Amr, and Dirar. It would be different if we could point to any evidence for verbal copying or even a close resemblance in reasoning in a specific passage, but we cannot. Thus a link between John of Damascus and the early Mu'tazila remains not only unproved but without grounds to support any degree of probability. All that can be said is that it is not impossible for the generations that followed Wasil and 'Amr. A.-T. Khoury, Les the'ologiens byzantine et I'Islam: Textes et auteurs (VIIIe -XIIIe s.)

I9.</page><page sequence="17">Islamic and non-Islamic origins of Mul'tazilite ethical rationalism 75 x The foregoing discussion of John of Damascus brings out the fault in method of efforts to link individuals to individuals, in the absence of specific evidence of the kinds required. But this does not rule out influences of undetermined Christian theologians on undetermined early Mu'tazilis, inferred from resem- blances in doctrine. What needs to be sought is a broader relation, to be sup- ported by a broader consideration of the history of the two religions in the centuries before and after their contact. This is attempted first with reference to theology as a whole and afterward with reference to ethics in particular. John of Damascus's Fountain of Knowledge is a summa that distills the essence of centuries of preceding Christian theology in the tradition of the Greek fathers. In the direct line of his predecessors the main figures are Origen, the Cap- padocians Basil and the two Gregories, then Nemesius of Emesa, Pseudo- Dionysius the Areopagite, and Maximus Confessor. Platonic and Neoplatonic ideas and Aristotelian logic are absorbed in the accumulated product of this tradition.' Now some works of each of these writers except Maximus had been translated into Syriac before Islam,2 and were therefore accessible to the Nestorian and Monophysite scholars of 'Iraq. Thus to a large extent these 'Iraqi Christians shared a common heritage with John. They too, like John, must have known Arabic well by the beginning of the eighth century at the latest. The Mu'tazila of 'Iraq were much closer to them than to him and communication with them is more likely. What form communication may have taken is hard to discover. There may have been conversations and dialogues. Some of the Mu'tazila, being converts, may have read Syriac theological literature before or after conversion. Or they may have read Arabic works after Christians had begun to write in Arabic. The most notable and pertinent Christian Arabic theologian was Theodore Abu Qurra (c. 750-820 or 825), an Orthodox Christian schooled in the tradition of John, who lived at Edessa, Harran where he was bishop, Jerusalem and perhaps Mar Saba, and made missionary journeys to Egypt, 'Iraq, and Armenia. Abu Qurra's Syriac works are lost, but several in Greek and Arabic have survived. They show a bold and active apologist, although the Arabic works are said to be more cautious than the Greek.3 It seems rather probable that his Muslim I See ibid, pp. 20-I; Gardet and Anawati, Introduction, pp. 202-3; and generally on Greek Christian Platonism before John, I.

Hourani contemporaries, Dirar and Abui al-Hudhayl, were acquainted with his thought through personal contact, reading his Arabic treatises, or both. How formative such contacts would be, however, is debatable in view of these Muslims' well- advanced intellectual evolution.' This survey is not meant to exclude John of Damascus, but only to put him in his place as one of several sources of influence, and probably not the most important. The total of resemblances and contacts makes it difficult to deny that there was an influence of Christian on Mu'tazilite theology, but the forms it took are elusive to the historian and will probably remain so. The reasons for this lie in the reticence of medieval Muslim theologians to acknowledge any studies beyond Islam, except for the purpose of refutation, and in the sheer multiplicity of channels. Historians have expressed this elusive but real relation of the two cultures in a variety of ways: the common thought-world (Becker), osmosis (Gardet and Anawati), taking spoils (Van Ess).2 Another symbol of the process may be found in the Corinthian capitals found on columns in early mosques, taken from unknown older buildings but all harmonized in the new Islamic art of the mosque. This image also reminds us that we must not overestimate the extent of influences. The sharp differences between Christian and Islamic theology, even at their closest convergence, have been pointed out by Catholic scholars in particular.3 In different ages, each one has taken from the other what it has found useful and adapted what it took to its own structure and needs. The quest for Christian influences on Mu'tazilite theology is further hampered by the extent of common doctrines between Christian and dualistic theologies. Since the same early Mu'tazila had access to Christian, Zoroastrian, and Mani- chaean theologies, it is sometimes impossible to decide whether they took ideas on a particular topic from one of these sources rather than another. An example is the doctrine of human free will. If a Mu'tazili looked outside Islam for sug- gestions on this question, he would find the same affirmation of free will in all three preceding religions. Meanwhile he would also be thinking for himself within the circle of Islamic discussion. I For the same reason, and more strongly, later Christian Arabic works and translations from Greek are of little relevance. Translations from the ninth century include Nemesius of Emesa, On the Nature of Man (not Gregory of Nyssa's Peri kataskeues anthr6pou), Gregory of Nyssa, al-Abwdb 'ald Ra'y al-.Hukamd' wa al-Faldsifa (a doxographical collection), and John of Damascus, De Fide Orthodoxa.

After drawing attention to 'strikingly near' parallels between Abu al-Hudhayl and Origen, he writes (pp. 458-9): 'Very little is known concerning AbC al-Hudhayl's theological background and to seek sources by grasping at the straws of too easily paralleled formulae is fruitless'. 3 Gardet and Anawati, Introduction, passim, esp. p. 207, last paragraph; Allard, Problekie, pp. I65-9.</page><page sequence="19">Islamnic and non-Islamic origins of Mt'tafilite ethical rationalism 77 XI Within the historical and theological framework outlined we can now consider the influence of Christian ethics on Mu'tazilite ethics. It has become clear that John of Damascus is rather late to have been a dominant influence on the earliest Mu'tazila. It will be helpful to go back to a much earlier thinker, whose ideas would certainly have had time to enter the bloodstream of Orthodox and Eastern Christianity before the first Muslim theologians were at work. To some extent it is arbitrary who is to be considered, since we cannot easily trace direct links between any earlier Christian theologian and the Mu'tazila. We should look for someone with similar ideas on ethics. We could find notable resemblances between Origen and the Mu'tazila, and he is worth mentioning as a founder of Christian rationalistic theology. But perhaps this would take us too far back (A.D. third century) to be relevant. We shall do better to attend to Gregory of Nyssa (335-394), a central mind in Christian theology who expressed an ethical doctrine steeped in Neoplatonism which can be regarded as 'classical', in the sense of setting the main lines for most of medieval Christian ethics in both east and west. His thought on ethics can be gathered from his Oratio Catechetica Magna,I and is set out briefly under the five headings used before.2 i. Objective values. The Logos is good and chooses good in everything. It made the world good (v, 2). 2. God, source of good alone. He had to share His light and pour out His love, so He made man able to participate in the divine goodness (v, 3-4). He cannot be the creator of evil, which is not in Him (v, i ). 3. Rational knowledge of values. Man had to be provided with reason and wisdom, so that he might desire to know the divine and have a relation with it (v, 6). 4. Man's power, source of evil. Man must also have been given freedom, so that he could practice virtue and be rewarded for it (v, 9-10). But this implies the possibility of choosing evil, which is vice (v, i i; viii, I8-9; vii, 3). This is lack of good, without actuality (v, I ; vii, 3). Its causes lie in man, with professional help from the Devil (vi, I--I ; viii, 6, I8-I9). 5. Everlasting rewards and purgative punishments (viii, i ). All five headings of Gregory's ethics coincide with those of the Mu'tazila, except for Gregory's belief in a purgatory which will be temporary for all sinners until the final purification of souls at the time of Judgment (viii, i ). But the details differ in many respects, above all in Gregory's doctrine of the negative character of evil and other Neoplatonic elements, none of which are found in Mu'tazilite ethics. Both purgatory and negative evil give Gregory more complete I Text in Works, ed. W. Jaeger et al. (Leiden, 1952-), vol. ix. German trans. J.

Hourani solutions to the problem of evil and its special form, the problem of theodicy, than the Mu'tazila could achieve. With all the variations, however, the agreement on the main positions be- tween Gregory and the Mu'tazila is notable. Could the latter have had any direct knowledge of Gregory's writings? Many of these were translated into Syriac, including the Oratio.' The possibilities for Mu'tazilite knowledge of Syriac learning have been discussed above (section x). There is no known translation of Gregory into Arabic before the ninth century.2 Thus there is no definite evidence linking Gregory with early Muslim theologians. A similar situation is true in regard to Pseudo-Dionysius, who may be con- sidered because he is probably later than Gregory (most likely of the later fifth century). The same positions on ethics are found in his work On the Divine Names whose chapter 4, 'On good and evil', is heavily dependent on Proclus.3 His works were translated into Syriac in the early sixth century by Sarjis of Rish'ayna.4 There are several in Arabic translations, but none known to be of early date.5 Maximus Confessor, of the same school of Christian Neoplatonists, would have been still more promising on chronological grounds since his life (c. 580-662) coincides with the origin and first expansion of Islam. But there is no evidence that he was known to medieval Muslims except as a mere name, listed among commentators on Aristotle.6 So we return to John of Damascus, this time as an ethical thinker. We find in his treatise On the Orthodox Faith all five of the Mu'tazilite propositions, co- inciding also with those of Gregory of Nyssa except for a tacit abandonment of universal purgatory for sinners.7 It would be tedious to repeat these headings or go into details. John's way of thinking is less Neoplatonic and more Ari- stotelian than Gregory's, and his style of writing is more in the manner of a systematic textbook, but his intellectual affiliation is clearly with the Cappadocians and Maximus. The broad resemblance to the Mu'tazila on ethics is just as marked, making allowance for the differences between Christianity and Islam, especially in Christology. But here an affiliation cannot be assumed, for reasons I See p. 73, n. 2 above. 2 See p. 74, n. I. 3 Ch. 4 in Migne, PG, vol. III, cols. 693-736; Fr. trans.

The decisive point is that some of the Mu'tazilite positions on ethics are already found in Islamic sources before the thought of John could have been known to Muslim theologians. This point needs to be supported by some details of the chronology of early Islamic ethics. Approximate dates are given for the earliest recorded assertions under the five headings of Mu'tazilite ethics. I. Objective values. Wasil (d. 748) in discussing qadar: God is 'Wise and Just', man 'is the agent of good and evil'.1 Objectivity seems implicit in these state- ments, in the context of what we know of Wasil's thought. Probably the earliest explicit statement is by Abu al-Hudhayl (c. 75I-849): Man prior to revelation 'must know the goodness of what is good and the evilness of what is evil'.2 2. God is the source of good alone. al-Hasan al-Basri (d. 728): 'Everything is by the decree and determination of God except sins.'3 Then Wasil on qadar: 'Evil and injustice cannot be attributed to God.'4 These are negative statements, but the positive side, that God is and does good, can be taken for granted in Islamic thought from the Qur'an onward. 3. Rational knowledge of values. The earliest statement seems to be one by Abu al-Hudhayl, that obligation is prior to revelation: A man ought to know God by proof (al-dalil), and he should know as well the good and evil qualities of human acts.5 Thus the theory of ethical knowledge starts relatively late, as would be expected. 4. Man's power is the source of moral evil. This is the position of the Qadariyya, forerunners of the Mu'tazila. The problem of qadar arose early in Islam. The first to discuss it was Ma'bad al-Juhani (d. 699) at al-Basra.6 Ma'bad is said to have talked with and learned from an 'Iraqi Christian named Susan.7 The statement of al-Hasan quoted above under point 2 implies that man is responsible for sins. Wasil says it plainly: 'It is the servant [man] who is the agent of good and evil, belief and unbelief, obedience and disobedience.'8 5. Everlasting rewards and punishments.

Hourani documented in early Islam, but it is well known that the Mu'tazila from the beginning insisted on it as a consequence of their belief in God's justice. Wasil says that man is requited for his acts; Abu al-Hudhayl that a man who is morally ignorant is subject to everlasting punishment.' Thus it appears, based on the limited evidence, that points 2, 4, and 5 are prior in Islamic theology to John of Damascus, point I is roughly contemporary, and only point 3 is later. On this basis no strong case can be made for an influence of John on Mu'tazilite ethics in its formative age. The latest Christian theologian who could be considered as having had an influence is Theodore Abu Qurra. As mentioned, his contacts with the Muslim intellectual world were close. What is known of his ethical views seems to follow the doctrines of his predecessor John. But by his time (c. 750 to 820 or 825) the Mu'tazilite theory was formed in its main lines, since his contemporary was Abui al-Hudhayl who was the real founder of this rationalism as a system. From this whole account, what connections can be seen between Christian and Mu'tazilite ethics? In every instance of a Christian theologian, taken alone, the conclusion seemed to be negative: no influence of this particular theologian on the Mu'tazila could be proved. Yet a survey of the field as a whole has given a different view. From the fourth to the eighth centuries there is a definite coincidence of doctrines on five major headings of ethics between a long line of Christian thinkers and all or most of the Mu'tazila. If we cannot point to this or that Christian as an influence, there was plenty of time and adequate opportunity for some Christian or other to have been influential. Whether or not anyone or several had such an influence must remain obscure in the absence of sufficient evidence. But the probabilities will be affected by our answer to questions still to be asked concerning the internal development of early Islamic thought: To what extent is there a necessary logic leading from the Qur'an and Traditions to Mu'tazilism as one side of an Islamic dialectic? And what evidence is there that this position was actually worked out among Muslims debating with one another? XII The three non-Islamic religions studied up to this point in their relations to the Mu'tazila had adherents, in greater or less numbers, whose opposition or conversion to Islam was an important consideration always present to the minds of Muslims. The situation of Greek philosophy in the Islamic world was com- pletely different. It was represented by a handful of disciples of the ancient philosophical tradition, working in Syriac or Arabic. They were not to be feared as a popular challenge to the solidarity of the Muslim community. Yet in another way Greek philosophy could be very powerful. Precisely because it was not a living threat, educated Muslims could respect its intellectual appeal all the more. 1 Ibid. I, 51 and 55.</page><page sequence="23">Islamic and non-Islamic origins of Mu'tazilite ethical rationalism 8T Some of them did so intensely, in the small circles that cultivated the secular sciences and philosophy, from the days of HArufn al-Rashid (reigned 786-809) and thereafter for several centuries; and these circles adopted Greek thought in form and content, with no attempt at concealment and with varying efforts to harmonize their theories with Islam. As a preliminary step to estimating the influence of this philosophy on Mu'tazilite ethics, it will be helpful to review the main stages by which it became familiar to Muslims and, parallel to these stages, the knowledge of Greek philosophy attributed to leading early Mu'tazila. No trace of Hellenism is to be detected in the founders of Mu'tazilism, Wasil and 'Amr, and this is to be expected in the light of the general ignorance of Greek thought in Islam at their period. But a surprising discovery has recently been made about a Muslim theologian contemporary with them, Jahm ibn Safwan (d. 746). Richard Frank has shown the Neoplatonic structure of his thought, to a degree that can hardly be accidental.' Jahm is not counted among the Mu'tazila, but he was close to them, so his Neoplatonism opens the possi- bility of Greek influence on the earliest of them. Yet there is no evidence of this. In the reign of Harun the first translations of Greek philosophy were made; meanwhile Abu al-Hudhayl (c. 751-849) was working out the first detailed Mu'tazilite system. It is reported that 'he studied something of the philosophers' books',2 but as he had a long life it is impossible to give any precision to the period of his study. Another Mu'tazili, al-Nazzam (d. 845), showed impressive knowledge of Aristotle in the presence of Harun's vizier Ja'far ibn Yahya al-Barmaki.3 In the reigns of al-Ma'mun (reigned 813-33) and al-Mu'tasim (reigned 833- 42) Islamic philosophy came to birth, evidently with some encouragement from the Mu'tazilite movement. Al-Ma'mun was an enthusiastic patron of both the Mu'tazilite doctrines, which he exalted to an official orthodoxy, and the intensive translation of the major writings of Greek philosophy. This double patronage was continued by al-Mu'tasim, although with less interest. The first philosopher in Islam, Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Kindi (d. c. 866), was close to the Mu'tazila in his theological views.4 The final stage in the adoption of philosophy in Islam was the physical home- coming of the philosophers to Baghdad. Max Meyerhof in a celebrated article described how the small remnant of the school of Alexandria emigrated from there to Antioch in the reign of 'Umar II (reigned 717-20), from Antioch to Harran under al-Mutawakkil (reigned 847-61), and finally to Baghdad under al-Mu'tadid (reigned 892-902).5 At the period of this last move, al-Jubba'i R.

Hourani (d. 915) was working out at Baghdad and al-Basra the classical Mu'tazilism of the Basra school in its more or less complete and enduring form. This sketch shows that there was contact, through books or persons, between the Mu'tazila and Greek philosophy at several times in the period under con- sideration; and it is probable that there was much more contact than is known from the haphazard evidence. Without going into the general question of the extent of affinity between the two schools, we may ask with regard to ethics: What were the points of agreement and difference? Such a question can only be answered here in a broad way, leaving out the many variations in the positions of individuals of both schools. I. The objectivity of good and evil was accepted unanimously on both sides. The Mu'tazila had to assert it and argue it emphatically against their voluntarist opponents in Islam; the Greeks could almost take it for granted, since to them the eternal 'laws' of the universe had always been supreme over gods and men alike. Even the hymn to Zeus of the Stoic Cleanthes is only a personalized paean to the immanent law or logos that governs the world. But the later Greek con- ceptions, from Aristotle to Plotinus, of good as actuality and evil as privation, are absent from Mu'tazilite thought. And this absence continues down to 'Abd al-Jabbar (c. 935-I025), although the Greek theory was well known in his life- time through the works of the Muslim philosophers and the Ikhwdn al-.Safd'. This suggests that the absence is due not to ignorance but to rejection, and although the Mu'tazilite writings are generally silent about this theory a few critical remarks on it are made by 'Abd al-Jabbar.' 2. Although in both systems 'good' is not defined by a relation to God, equally in both God is a source of actual good in the world, and of good alone, never of evil. But there is a difference in the manner of His causation of good: simply stated, to the Greeks it flows from His nature, to the Mu'tazila He creates it by His will. 3. Both groups held that man can know good and evil, obligatory and wrong acts by his reason. But the Mu'tazila accepted in addition a second source of ethical knowledge, the commands of God given in revelation. A legend reported in the Fihrist attributes the Mu'tazilite view to Aristotle. It is said there that one of the reasons why books on philosophy became abundant was a dream of al- Ma'mun, in which he saw Aristotle and questioned him as follows: Q. 'What is the good?' A. 'Whatever is good by reason.' Q. 'What next?' A. 'Whatever is good by the Law [al-sharl'a].' Q. 'What next?' A. 'Whatever is good according to the public.' Q. 'What next?' A. 'Nothing next.'2 I Mughtn, vol. vi, part i, p. 80; Hourani, Islamic Rationalism, pp. 65-6. 2 Nadim, Fihrist, p. 339; trans.

In the ethical writings of Plato and Aristotle, as in those of the Mu'tazila, man has power to do evil. But in all of them the possibility and actuality of this moral evil did not create much of a problem in relation to God; He is simply not responsible for human sins. For the Stoics with their stronger sense of divine omnipotence and providence it created a problem of harmonization, somewhat akin to that of traditional Islam (even though their solution was different from that of al-Ash'ari). 5. Rewards and punishments in an afterlife are not taken very seriously in Greek philosophy, as they have to be in any theology based on the Qur'an. Plato writes of them in myths at the end of some dialogues, thus making clear their speculative status. Consequently problems of theodicy are also not prominent among the Greeks, whereas the Mu'tazila devote much attention to them in controversy with their traditional Muslim opponents. Aside from the differences mentioned under the five headings, Mu'tazilite ethics as known fully from 'Abd al-Jabbar is developed in quite another way from Aristotle's ethics which became the basis for philosophical ethics in Islam; for example, in Miskawayh's Tahdhib al-Akhldq. Among the notable omissions by the Mu'tazili are any use of Aristotelian technical language and the whole theory of virtue, including habit, the mean, the life of happiness, the methods of practical reason, and so on. The conclusions from this account are fairly clear. Mu'tazilite theologians from Abu al-Hudhayl onward either knew something of Greek philosophy or had it available if they wished to study it. Since they did not make use of it in their ethics, this must have been a deliberate choice. The main lines of their ethical thought were already laid down prior to Abu al-Hudhayl, determined by their Islamic background and whatever influences had come in from Christianity or elsewhere. They then developed it according to the demands of their con- troversies with Muslim traditionalists and with opponents in other religions. XIII We must now try to see how Mu'tazilite ethics could have grown to its finished form as a result of stimuli occurring within the sphere of Islam. As a methodo- logical device all outside influences will be excluded at this stage, with a view to estimating how far we can explain the system of thought on a purely Islamic basis. Discussion on ethics in Islam was carried on within the framework of two fixed points, the unshakable beliefs of all parties with regard to point 2, 'God is one, the Creator and entirely good,' and point 5, 'He rewards and punishes men justly in an afterlife'. The first problem that arose was that of theodicy, when a strict predestinarian interpretation of point 2 led to the doctrine of jabr, that God creates all the acts of everyone: thus there was no room under point 4 for human freedom and responsibility. The roots of such an interpretation lie in 6 M 1: s7 I</page><page sequence="26">84 George F. Hourani many passages of the Qur'an, but the Qur'an also contains roots for an opposite interpretation, so the Book as a whole did not settle the question. The Traditions are generally more predestinarian, perhaps reflecting ancient Arabian beliefs, as Watt suggested.' John of Damascus shows predestinarianism as the prevailing belief of Muslims in his time.2 Such a position raised the obvious theodical conflict between 2 and 4 as thus interpreted and 5: 'If God compels the evil acts of men, He cannot be just in punishing them for these acts.' The Qadariyya took up the challenge of this conflict and solved it in a simple way by reinterpreting 2 and 4. God was the all-powerful Creator but had given men the power to determine their own acts. Thus the punishments of God for a man's sins would be just. This position was taken up by the Mu'tazila, who called themselves the party of justice (ahl al-'adl) as against their Muslim opponents of predestinarian views. Thereafter both parties refined their positions as a result of their mutual tensions. The remaining two headings, i, ontology of value and 3, theory of ethical knowledge, were the products of a more advanced stage of thought on each side. They were not logically dependent on the first three but rather were derived from the same attitudes to God and scripture which had produced those three. The traditional party (ahl al-sunna) were those who insisted on two principles: the overwhelming power of God and the obligation on man to follow the teaching of revelation as the sole source of religious knowledge. From the latter principle point 3 follows directly: Revelation is the sole source of ethical knowledge. Point I follows from both principles: Values must be derived from God's will and could not be independent objects knowable by human reason. In other words, objectivity of values would set a limit to God's power and would threaten the monopoly of revelation as the source of religious knowledge. The Mu'tazila sought above all a reasonable and morally convincing religion which they believed could also be justified by the text of scripture. If God is just, man must be responsible for his acts, and responsibility implies the pos- sibility of sufficient moral knowledge even when a scripture is not available, as for many non-Muslims. This leads to 3, the power of human reason to know right and wrong in actions. And from this point i follows directly, since reason must have real objects for its knowledge. This is a bare outline of positions, which could be enriched almost infinitely from the history of the two theological schools in detail, as well as by a study of parallel movements in jurisprudence and by considerations of political history. But the intention has been only to show how the intellectual constructions of both schools could have arisen out of a purely Islamic background, and this could be shown more clearly by presenting the essential structures of their thought without distractions of detail.

But that is too simple a statement. For although there is no definite evidence linking a Mu'tazili with a non-Muslim theologian, the ac- cumulation of circumstantial evidence on the historical relations between early Muslims and their non-Muslim neighbors and rivals cannot be ignored. A more accurate conclusion may be expressed as follows. Within the context of early Islam, two main ethical positions were easily possible, of which one would be more acceptable to former Zoroastrians, Manichaeans, and Christians, while the other might appear more purely Islamic to Muslims untouched by such circles or reacting against them. The Mu'tazila were the party who took the first position, because they were missionaries on the frontiers of Islam, who felt the weight of the large populations and powerful intellectual traditions that they were called upon to combat. The pressures in the sphere of ethics may be illustrated with a few quotations showing non-Muslim demands for theodicy. On the Christian side we may go back to Origen, who lived long before Islam but was one of the formative founders of Christian theology. We say that God is unable to do evil, because a God who would be able to do so would not really be God. For if God does anything evil He is not God.' John of Damascus takes up this theme against his traditional Muslim opponents. Christian: But how do you say that good and evil things are from God? God according to you will then be unjust, which He is not.2 In the Zoroastrian tradition, Mardan Farrukh attacks the contradiction in any religion which affirms that evils can come from a perfect God. If they could, that would mean that He would not be perfect; and if He is not perfect, it is not right to praise Him for divinity and perfect goodness.3 There is no need to gather more quotations. The idea of theodicy was deeply embedded in the two religions. It may even be called a 'natural' human idea, and it was one that would inevitably have been demanded by many Muslims even if they had not found it in their own scriptures and the teachings of other religions. The Muslim community would have been insensitive if it had not produced a response to this demand which came from all sides. The Mu'tazila were those who tried hardest to respond to it.

Hourani xv Beyond the particular sphere of ethics, rationalistic methods are normal in interreligious controversy, because if the adversaries are to be able to discuss religion at all they must find common ground and not presume the truth of their own faith. This is an idea that recurs constantly in the history of religion. Theodore Abfi Qurra says he will argue with Muslims not on the basis of scripture but 'from common, agreed notions' (ek koinon kai homologoumenon ennoion).' On the Muslim side, a certain al-Hashimi of the time of al-Ma'mun expresses the rational spirit of the age in a letter inviting a Christian al-Kindi to embrace Islam: Therefore bring forward all the arguments you wish and say whatever you please and speak your mind freely. Now that you are safe and free to say whatever you please, appoint some arbitrator who will impartially judge between us and lean only towards the truth and be free from the empery of passion: and that arbitrator shall be reason, whereby God makes us responsible for our own rewards and punishments. Hereby I have dealt justly with you and have given you full security and am ready to accept whatever decision reason may give for me or against me. For 'there is no compulsion in religion' and I have only invited you to accept our faith willingly and of your own accord.2 St Paul practiced the same method without formulating it when he preached to pagan Greeks near the Areopagus in Athens: he presented his argument for Christianity in rational terms which might persuade Stoic and Epicurean philosophers.3 Before long this became a firm policy of early Christian apologists, when the problem had to be faced on a larger scale, as Werner Jaeger explained so clearly in his Early Christianity and Greek Paideia: Thus there came into existence, about the middle of the second century, a large body of literature through which Christians spoke to the pagan majority of the population in self-defense. It is obvious that this polyphonic chorus could not in their apology take for granted what they were going to defend. That is what distinguished their situation from earlier Christian literature. These new advocates of their religion had to find some common ground with the people they addressed if they wanted to reach an understanding. That compelled them to take a more rational approach to their own cause, in order to make it possible for others to join them in a real discussion.4 Finally, Thomas Aquinas gave classic expression to this necessity in announcing his intentions in the Summa contra Gentiles: ...some of them, such as the Mohammedans and the pagans, do not agree with us in accepting the authority of any Scripture, by which they may be convinced of their I Opuscula, in PG, vol. xcvII, col. 1551; quoted by Becker, 'Christliche Polemik', p. 445.

Thus, against the Jews we are able to argue by means of the Old Testament, while against heretics we are able to argue by means of the New Testament. But the Mohammedans and the pagans accept neither the one nor the other. We must, there- fore, have recourse to natural reason, to which all men are forced to give their assent. However, it is true, in divine matters the natural reason has its failings.' So this is what the Mu'tazila were doing, only without the reservation stated in the last sentence quoted from Thomas. As time passed and Islam became ever more secure and dominant, these pioneer apologists were reproached for having deviated from the true religion, now seen by Sunnis more and more in a tradi- tional, predestinarian and voluntarist light. Such reproaches were defective in historical understanding of the original context and role of the Mu'tazilite movement. For the Mu'tazila always chose whatever doctrines suited their position inside Islam and were never overwhelmed by any non-Muslim system, however impressive it might be on an intellectual level. That is proved by their cool reception of Greek philosophy, which they passed by almost unnoticed, although certainly not unknown to them. Von Grunebaum stressed the independence of early Islamic culture, taking it back to the cocoon stage in Arabia. Even when every allowance is made for the contingent character of historical develop- ments it still remains safe to state that on their exodus from the Peninsula the Arab Muslims had made the 'governing decisions' in regard to what they considered their physical and spiritual ancestry; hence they had so to speak predetermined what, on being exposed to a large spectrum of cultural possibilities, was to fit in with their sense of cultural affiliation, and thus, too, the sources on which they might draw to solve problems and fill gaps of which as yet they were, for the most part, unaware.2 Perhaps von Grunebaum went too far. If we try to apply his generalization to the Mu'tazila, we have to remember that they were 'Iraqis or Persians, whose cultural background was Babylonian or Persian, Christian, Zoroastrian, or Manichaean. It was not likely that they had so quickly assimilated themselves to the Arabs as to accept Arabian attitudes not considered essential to Islam. But certainly their outlook on life was already firmly bound within the new Weltan schauung created by the Arabic Qur'an. No ancient culture, however rich, could withstand the tremendous power of the Book. STATE UNIVERSITY OF NEW YORK BUFFALO, NEW YORK I, ii, sect. 3, as trans. A. C.
