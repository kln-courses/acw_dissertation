<plain_text><page sequence="1">GENERAL/SPECIFIC, LOCAL/GLOBAL: COMPARING THE BEGINNINGS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA (ETHIOPIA/ERITREA) AND SOUTHWEST ARABIA (YEMEN) Michael J. Harrower, Joy McCorriston, and A. Catherine D' Andrea The Horn of Africa and Southwest Arabia are less than 30 km apart, yet the timing and nature of transitions to agriculture along the margins of the southern Red Sea differ substantially. This paper compares and contrasts the beginnings of agri culture in highland Ethiopia/Eritrea and Yemen. We evaluate the applicability of general models, emphasize social circum stances and particularities, and highlight the importance of differing spatiotemporal scales from interregional perspectives that address millennia-long changes across continents to local choices during human lifetimes. We consider why agricul ture appears so much later than it does throughout the eastern Mediterranean and argue that the traditionally rigid dis tinction between the u origins" and "spread" of agriculture oversimplifies transitions along the southern Red Sea in which agriculture in some ways diffused to, and in other ways, uniquely originated in Southwest Arabia and the Horn of Africa. We concordantly maintain that, particularly when agriculture is considered a societal transformation, regions where agri culture appears comparatively later are as important to understanding transitions to agriculture as regions where agricul ture appears earliest. Hay menos de 30 km de distancia entre el Cuerno de Africa y el Suroeste de Arabia, sin embargo, cudndo y como ocurrieron las transiciones a la agricultura a lo largo de las mdrgenes sur del Mar Rojo es sustancialmente diferente. Este documento compara y contrasta los inicios de la agricultura en las altiplanicies de Etiopia y Eritrea y Yemen. Se evalua la aplicabilidad de los modelos generates, haciendo hincapie en las circunstancias sociales y sus peculiaridades, y se destaca la importancia de las diferentes escalas espacio-temporales desde una perspectiva inter-regional, abarcando los cambios en los dos conti nentes a lo largo de milenios, asi como tambien las selecciones locales durante la vida de los asentamientos humanos. Con sideramos por que la agricultura aparece mucho mas tarde de lo que lo hace en el resto del Mediterrdneo oriental, y sostenemos que la tradicional, y rigida, distincion entre los "ortgenes" y el " extendimiento " de la agricultura simplifica demasiado las transiciones a lo largo del sur del Mar Rojo, donde la agricultura, en ciertas maneras, se propago, y en otras, se origino de una forma unica en el suroeste de Arabia y el Cuerno de Africa. Tambien sostenemos que, sobre todo cuando la agricultura se considera una transformacion social, las regiones donde la agricultura aparece comparativamente mas tarde son tan impor tantes para entender la transicion a la agricultura que las regiones donde la agricultura aparece mas temprano. Archaeologists traditionally divide regions into those where agriculture first origi nated and those where it subsequently spread. In light of recent evidence illustrating the comparatively late appearance of agriculture along the margins of the southern Red Sea, it would seem the Horn of Africa and Southwest Arabia should be placed within the latter group. However, osten sibly secondary transitions to agriculture involve far more than simply receiving the idea of agricul ture or merely transplanting species first domesti cated elsewhere. This paper examines transitions to food production in highland areas on either side of the southern Red Sea. It considers why agricul ture appears comparatively far later than around the eastern Mediterranean, draws attention to prob lems with the often rigid dichotomy drawn between the origins and spread of agriculture, and high lights conflicts induced by differences in the spa tiotemporal scale of general models.

Southwest Arabia and the Horn of Africa are separated by only 30 km at the southern end of the Red Sea but are often viewed as separate archaeo logical culture areas that are frequently examined independently. These regions, however, share sig nificant historic and environmental similarities that make them attractive for comparison. Highland areas in both regions are characterized by a diver sity of terrain at roughly the same latitude and even tually came to rely on many of the same domesticates. They share significant ancient con nections and were in contact with some of the same influential regions, including Egypt, the Levant, and Mesopotamia. In both regions adoption of for eign species as well as formulation of locally viable farming techniques were important, and in the Horn of Africa domestication of indigenous crops played a role. Just as the Nile has been viewed as a gate way to Africa, the Red Sea served as much as a con duit of contact as a barrier (Mitchell 2005). Important recent contributions that integrate evi dence from along the Red Sea have often focused on first millennium B.C. and later trade (e.g., Lunde and Porter 2004; Starkey 2005, Starkey et al. 2007). However, the first millennium B.C. was not only a time of dramatically expanding trade and sociopo litical transformation in the region but, additionally, marks the earliest conclusive evidence of crops in Ethiopia/Eritrea. These changes were undoubtedly closely interconnected. Thus, explaining the begin nings of food production continues to be crucial for understanding rapidly burgeoning sociopolitical complexity (and vice versa). Early scholars identified the highlands of Ethiopia as a center of agricultural origins (e.g., Sauer 1952; Vavilov 1951) and many continue to hypothesize that agriculture developed along the southern Red Sea substantially earlier than avail able archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological evi dence can demonstrate (Barnett 1999; Butler 2002; Fattovich 2005a; Lyons and D' Andrea 2003; McCorriston 2006). Given the still relatively scant archaeological survey coverage and the likelihood that processing of African crops made them less amenable to preservation (D'Andrea et al. 1999; Lyons and D' Andrea 2003; Young and Thompson 1999) there may indeed be considerably earlier herders or farmers yet to be discovered, but it also remains possible that current evidence does approx imate the earliest agriculture (Neumann 2003, 2005). While a single site with well-documented domesticates could establish that agriculture appeared far earlier than heretofore demonstrated, for the purposes of this paper, we rely on what direct archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological evi dence is presently available. We largely avoid the issues of rockart and linguistic evidence that are dif ficult to accurately date and therefore require more exclusive, lengthy consideration (see Bellwood and Renfrew 2002; Blench 2006; Brandt and Carder 1987; Diamond and Bellwood 2003; Dowson 1994; Ehret et al. 2004). Current archaeological evidence indicates that species domesticated in the Levant (incl. cattle, sheep, goats, wheat, and barley) and Africa (incl. sorghum and cattle) were among the staples of early agriculture in the Horn of Africa and Southwest Arabia. Cattle and sorghum emerged as crucial resources of post-Pleistocene Nilotic fisher herder-cultivator communities, and the intersection of the African "cattle complex," Levantine crops, and sorghum along the Nile (Haaland 1995,1999; Magid 1989; Magid and Caneva 1998; Shirai 2006; Wetterstrom 1993, 1998) clearly influenced peo ples along the southern Red Sea. To assume, how ever, that agriculture was discovered and merely spread north to south vastly oversimplifies complex histories (Chami 2007). Southwest Arabia and the Horn of Africa are far more than peripheral hin terlands that passively received agriculture as an invention from abroad. Rather than cinematic extras who appear at the end of a drama nearly completed somewhere else, ancient residents of these regions are more appropriately viewed as assiduous pro tagonists who selected from a variety of options and, in the Horn of Africa, domesticated local species, namely, tef (Eragrostis tef), enset (Ensete ventricosum), noog (Guizotia abyssinica), and pos sibly hyacinth bean (Lablab purpureus) (Engels et al. 1991; Fuller and Harvey 2006:225). Reasons why agriculture did not appear as soon as it was known are arguably as important and enlightening as reasons why agriculture does eventually appear (Barakat 2002; Marshall and Hildebrand 2002; Neumann 2003, 2005). This does not require that agricultural lifeways are considered superior and</page><page sequence="3">454 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 3,2010 that areas where agriculture appears comparatively late must be considered developmental backwa ters; but, instead, acknowledging a comparatively late appearance of agriculture prompts one to con sider not only the economic and social advantages and attractions but, also, the disadvantages and aversions that made agriculture less alluring than frequently assumed. Indeed, a long and successful history of foraging is remarkable in and of itself (Tosi 1986) and we need not necessarily look to an early Holocene appearance of agriculture to high light ingenuity and acumen. General Explanations for the Comparatively Late Appearance of Agriculture Continental to global scale explanations of transi tions to agriculture frequently obscure subregional complexities, particularly in lesser-known areas, and the southern Red Sea margins are therefore well-suited to clarify the diversity of trajectories toward agriculture. General explanations: (1) often paint stark dichotomies between supposed regions of origination and regions of spread, (2) frequently overlook the crucial "why not before?" question, and (3) often focus on a particular spatiotemporal scale with little emphasis on the complexities and diversity of local contexts. Indeed, a wide range of competing general explanations for transitions to agriculture emphasize a variety of factors, includ ing climate change (Richerson et al. 2001), demo graphic stress (Binford 2001; Rosenberg 1990, 1998), coevolution and subsequent extensification (Rindos 1980, 1984, 1989), social pressure (Hay den 1995, 2003), and ideological change (Cauvin 2000; Hodder 1990). The former three emphasize interregional to global scale changes over many millennia, while the latter two emphasize smaller scale human choices and agency. Studies that mobi lize linguistic and genetic evidence to explain the spread of agriculture (Bellwood 2004; Bellwood and Renfrew 2002; Diamond and Bellwood 2003) concordantly depict broad outlines across conti nents, rely on a long-term view of agriculture as demographically inevitable, and underplay the vari able and often discontinuous local circumstances that led particular groups to choose (or not choose) food production. Applications of Human Behav ioral Ecology emphasize the economic efficiency of different food acquisition options (e.g., Kennett and Winterhalder 2006) yet require local cultural perspectives to balance efficiency against idiosyn crasy and the often diverse ramifications of differ ent choices for particular social groups. While the longevity of the aforementioned models and tem plate approaches indicates that each have a role to play in explanation, as Zeder emphasized, "causal scenarios that narrowly focus on a single, univer sally applicable prime-mover levers of change will never provide satisfying answers to the critical 'why' questions about the origins of domestication and subsequent agricultural emergence" (2006:115). Rather than a single explanation, a multivariate balance, that acknowledges both the wide spectrum of plant and animal exploitation strategies (Smith 2001) along with the profound sociohistorical changes that often accompany agri culture, more likely lies amidst the present diver sity of long-standing models (Barker 2006). Overviews of early food production in Africa have long noted the importance of climatic, demo graphic, and social factors (e.g., Clark and Brandt 1984; Harlan et al. 1976) and they continue to be identified as important (Bower 1991, 1995; Has san 2002; Marshall and Hildebrand 2002; Muz zolini 1993). However, archaeologists face substantive challenges in evaluating the relative importance of contributing influences. In contrast with the Near East and Europe, for which culture histories have been outlined in rich detail, research on agricultural origins along the southern Red Sea still grapples with basic chronological questions and issues of independent invention, diffusion, and migration. In both Yemen and Ethiopia/Eritrea, it remains challenging to distinguish between allochthonous influences spawned by incursions of foreigners versus autochthonous influences spawned by local dynamics. At present numerous alternative scenarios, including: (1) immigration of foreign pastoralists or farmers, (2) foragers inde pendently domesticating local species and then, soon after, adopting foreign domesticates, and (3) foragers importing foreign domesticates, cannot be excluded. We take the slightly different heuristic tack of considering environmental, demographic, revo lutionary, and social explanations for the compar atively late appearance of agriculture (see Tables 1-2). Indeed, for almost any potential explanation for a switch to agriculture, a reciprocal explanation</page><page sequence="4">Harrower et al.] BEGINNINGS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ARABIA 455 Table 1.

Competing hypotheses are drawn as reciprocals from expla nations for the origins of agriculture and from a number of recent contributions that have explicitly considered the late appearance of agriculture in Africa (Barakat 2002; Magid 1991; Marshall and Hildebrand 2002; Neumann 2003, 2005). Impor tantly, any explanation for agriculture's delayed appearance must be consistent with any proposed explanation for why agriculture did eventually appear, and explicit integration of "why" and "why not before" explanations offers an informative, unique perspective on transitions to agriculture in any and all regions. Evidence for Cattle, Sheep, Goats, Crops, and Irrigation Recent finds have pushed dates for animal hus bandry and crops in Yemen back to the very early sixth and fourth millennia cal B.C., respectively (see Table 3). The earliest evidence for domestic fauna in the Horn of Africa falls during the third millennium and crops significantly later during the mid-first millennium cal B.C. (see Table 4).

Egyptian hieroglyphs document expeditions to the land of Punt (the southern end of the Red Sea) as early as 2,500 B.C., and by the second millennium independent records, including Temple of Hat shepsut reliefs at Deir el-Bahri, describe thousands strong trading ventures to Punt (Fattovich 2005b; Kitchen 1993, 2004; Meeks 2003; Phillips 1997). Mesopotamian 'Ubaid ceramics found at sites in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (as early as the second half of the fifth millennium) attest to early trade along the Persian Gulf (e.g., Uerpmann and Uerpmann 1996), and movements down the middle or western side of the Arabian Peninsula may have similarly contributed to dis semination of animal and plant rearing lifeways (Zarins 1992, 1998). Through contact with the Lower or Middle Nile, the Levant, or somewhat more indirectly from Mesopotamia, residents of the southern Red Sea margins would have there fore been exposed to agriculture, but they appar ently continued foraging for thousands of years after contacts with agriculturists. In both Yemen and Ethiopia, cattle is the earli est domesticate with sheep and goats following shortly thereafter. Cattle were domesticated in the northern Levant by the eighth millennium B.C. (Peters et al. 1999; Russell et al. 2005), and although it remains a point of controversy, they may have been domesticated in northeast Africa by nearly the same time (Close and Wendorf 1992; Gautier 2002; MacDonald 2000; Wendorf and Schild 1998). While there have been claims for sev enth millennium domestic cattle at Ash-Shumah along the Tihama coast of Yemen (Cattani and Bokonyi 2002:34), this assertion (based largely on a single horn-corn fragment) is widely considered inconclusive (Edens and Wilkinson 1998; Fedele</page><page sequence="6">Harrower et al.] BEGINNINGS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ARABIA 457 Table 3.

Cattle remains from Wadi at-Tayyilah 3 (Yemen) more convincingly point to cattle hus bandry during the fourth millennium (Fedele 2008), and finds at al-Buhais 18 in the United Arab Emirates attest to caprine husbandry (along with some exploitation of cattle) at the end of the fifth millennium B.C. (Uerpmann et al. 2000). Most recently, excavations at Manayzeh in Yemen's east ern highlands yielded a small collection of domes ticated cattle, sheep, and possibly goats dated to the cusp of the seventh and sixth millennia (Mar tin et al. 2009). The earliest cattle fall substantially later during the late-third or second millennium in the Horn of Africa at Laga Oda and Lake Besaka, Ethiopia (Brandt 1984; Clark 1988; Clark and Prince 1978; Clark and Williams 1978), Asa Koma, Djibouti (Guerin and Faure 1996), Gogoshiis Qabe, Somalia (Brandt 1986, 1988; Brandt and Carder 1987), and perhaps somewhat earlier (in an assemblage dominated by caprines) near Lake Turkana along the border of Ethiopia and Kenya at Dongodien (Marshall 2000; Marshall et al. 1984). Domestic cattle have also been reported from Late Stone Age (LS A) Ethiopia at the site of Quiha (Clark 1988:59), where on the basis of ceramics, Barnett (1999:137) speculatively sug gests a date between the fourth and first millen nia; as well as during the first millennium B.C. at Gobedra (Phillipson 1977, 1993), Ona Nagast (Bard et al. 2000), and Lalibela (Dombroski 1970, 1971) making their presence during this later inter val comparatively well documented.

Because identifications of crops from impressions are fre quently equivocal, the timing of sorghum's appear ance remains controversial (de Moulins et al. 2003; Fuller 2002:281; Tengberg 2003). Indeed, some have argued sorghum was cultivated at sites near Khartoum as early as 4,000 B.C. (Haaland 1995, 1999; Krzyzaniak 1991), yet the earliest defini tively domesticated sorghum in Africa dates to the mid-first millennium B.C. (Fuller 2004; Pelling 2005; Shinnie and Anderson 2004:366). This issue has long remained perplexing because African crops including sorghum have traditionally been identified in South Asia long before this time. Indeed, recent reevaluations confirm sorghum and other African cultivars presence in South Asia at least by the early second millennium B.C. (Fuller 2002, 2003, 2006). This finding strongly supports the possibility that sorghum was first cultivated for a substantial interval without genetic changes pos sibly because of the reaping strategies employed (Hillman and Davies 1990), because of out crossing with adjacent wild stands (see Arriola and Ellestrand 1997; Dje et al. 2004; Schmidt and Bothma 2006), or because selective pressures were otherwise insufficient to isolate cultivated popula tions and induce requisite genetic changes (Fuller 2007; Magid 1991). Somewhat less controversially, a recently retrieved macrobotanical collection of wheat, barley, lentils, chickpeas, peas, and possi bly broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) from Hayt al-Suad and Jubabat al-Juruf (near Dhamar) places the earliest crops in Yemen during the late fourth millennium (Edens 2005; Ekstrom and Edens 2003). Terrace agriculture in western Yemen (Wilkinson 2006) and small-scale hillslope runoff irrigation in eastern Yemen similarly date to the fourth millennium (Harrower 2008b). Thus far, no plant domesticates have been documented in the Horn of Africa before the first millennium Pre Aksumite (Ethiopia) and Ona (Eritrea) periods. Levantine domesticates along with the now earli est evidence of domesticated tef were retrieved from Ona Culture sites in Eritrea (D'Andrea et al. 2008b). Wheat, barley, lentils, and flax have also been recovered from first millennium B .C. contexts near Aksum (Bard et al. 1997; Boardman 1999, 2000; D'Andrea 2008), along with barley, chick peas, and other tentatively identified legumes from Lalibela cave (Dombrowski 1971). Southern Red Sea Transitions to Agriculture: The Applicability of General Models Recent research warrants renewed consideration of factors responsible for the nature and timing of agriculture's appearance along the southern Red Sea. While it is possible that the still comparatively scant coverage of field investigations has failed to establish appropriate dates for the beginnings of agriculture, this possibility is becoming less likely. Independent investigations in Yemen (de Maigret 1990, 2002; McCorriston et al. 2002; Wilkinson 2005, 2006) and Ethiopia/Eritrea (Brandt 1984; D'Andrea et al. 2008b; Phillipson 2000; Schmidt et al. 2008a) have arrived at similar dates within, but very different dates between the two regions. Assuming that archaeologists have now established approximately appropriate dates (sixth millennium for cattle and fourth millennium B.C. for crops in Yemen, third millennium for cattle and first mil lennium B.C. for crops in Ethiopia/Eritrea) there is even less consensus regarding how transitions to agriculture along the southern Red Sea can or should be explained. Climatic and Environmental Change Southwest Arabia and highland Ethiopia/Eritrea fall at approximately the same latitude (10? to 16?). Monsoon precipitation, largely a function of sea sonal shifts in the position of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone, occurs predominantly from March through August. Moist conditions during the early Holocene variably deemed the Holocene climatic optimum (Rossignol-Strick 1999) or African Humid Period (de Menocal et al. 2000) ended during the fourth millennium as identified, for instance, in the drying of African Lakes and reduced flows along the Nile (Gasse 2000; Hassan 1997; Krom et al. 2002; Pachur and Hoelzmann 2000). In Southwest Arabia, increasing aridity dur ing this interval (Wilkinson 2005) may have con tributed to wild plant food scarcity and therefore initial experiments with cultivation. Along middle Wadi Sana, early Holocene sedimentary accumu lation shifted to erosion near the end of the fourth millennium (Anderson 2007; Oches et al. 2001), yet it is presently difficult to establish whether irri</page><page sequence="9">460 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 3,2010 gation began just before, or concurrent with, arid ification (Harrower 2008b). Some have suggested that drier mid-Holocene conditions pressured Sana ran pastoralists to move south (Bower 1991,1995; Hassan 2002). In Tigrai, paleoenvironmental stud ies focusing on the later half of the Holocene show continually oscillating conditions and a trend toward aridity with human-induced erosion after the late first millennium B.C. (Bard et al. 2000, Dar byshire et al. 2003; Dramis et al. 2003; Machado et al. 1998) but the beginnings of agriculture in the Horn of Africa have yet to be conclusively con nected with climate change. A number of recent explanations for the com paratively late appearance of Africa have empha sized environmental circumstances. Neumann (2003,2005) presents a "Garden of Eden Hypoth esis" that argues rich savanna environments offered such attractive hunting, foraging and herding opportunities that they inhibited the appearance of crops. Neumann considers a number of potentially contributing factors including missing evidence, lack of demographic pressure, and emphasizes the role of mobility in precluding cultivation, but offers no explicit explanation for why crops did eventu ally appear, which would clearly need to be con sistent with any explanation for why they were initially eschewed. Presumably the Garden of Eden Hypothesis would imply an interval of aridity or population pressure eventually reduced prosperity and mobility and made agriculture more attractive than foraging. In a more lengthy treatment Mar shall and Hildebrand (2002) offer an environmen tally oriented risk management explanation for transitions to agriculture in Africa. They discuss the late domestication of plants and mention a variety of factors, including preservation and recovery issues, but ultimately emphasize that: this [the late appearance of crops] is largely because the unpredictable environments of the early middle Holocene Sahara, and the mobile pastoral lifestyles they fostered, together cre ated circumstances in which humans would not have exercised continuous, directional selection on cereals [Marshall and Hildebrand 2002:129]. While risk avoidance and mobility may have inhib ited cultivation, Marshall and Hildebrands' expla nation largely leaves open the issue of why crops did eventually appear. Shifts in the relative cost benefits of different strategies spawned by chang ing environmental circumstances, harvesting practices, and migration are highlighted, but a spe cific, widespread change in risk-related variables is neither identified nor emphasized as a prospect for future research; rather, mosaic constellations of such factors are emphasized. Barakat (2002) also offers a number of environmentally focused expla nations to account for the late appearance of agri culture in Africa and notes rich environments in some areas, high interannual variability in others, intervals of drought, and the importance of domes ticates introduced from Southwest Asia. Less variable climatic conditions after the end of the Pleistocene (Dansgaard et al. 1993) may have been necessary for sustainable agriculture but they clearly were not sufficient, and did not (at least during the first half of the Holocene) make agri culture obligatory as Richerson et al (2001) sug gest. Areas along the southern Red Sea must have been missing some other necessary stimulus or stimuli. At least at their apparently low densities (see below), moist early Holocene environments would have comfortably sustained mobile foragers. Rather than new avenues of experimentation made possible by favorable climates, periods of increased aridity appear to have been more important in pro moting subsistence change. Aridification, begin ning near the end of the fourth millennium, had important impacts in Southwest Arabia (McCor riston et al. 2002; Wilkinson 2005) and perhaps later lesser magnitude oscillations were important throughout the Horn of Africa. However, with dra matically different dates for the appearance of food production on either side of the Red Sea, a single interregional climate shift falls short as a prime mover of transitions to agriculture. Population Pressure In light of the depth of human history in Ethiopia and Yemen, one would expect a considerable num ber of early Holocene sites, but the southern Red Sea margins appear to have been relatively sparsely populated prior to the earliest evidence for agri culture (Brandt 1986; Edens and Wilkinson 1998; see also Marks 1987). Although recent erosion may have displaced or covered early remains, the relative paucity of early Holocene sites (particu larly in highlands of the Horn of Africa) is strik</page><page sequence="10">Harrower et al.] BEGINNINGS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ARABIA 461 ing. In the 100 km2 area of eastern Tigrai initially systematically surveyed by the Gulo-Makeda Archaeological Project (G-MAP), the LS A is rep resented by only shallow deposits in two small rockshelters and sporadic finds in survey transects (D'Andrea et al. 2008a). Although LSA site den sities are possibly marginally higher in western Tigrai, including near Aksum (Finneran 2000a, 2000b; Phillipson 2000:26) and Shire (Finneran et al. 2005; Finneran and Phillips 2003; Negash 1997) , survey in the Greater Asmara area of Eritrea similarly yielded few pre-first millennium B.C. sites (Curtis 2008:331). The low density of LSA sites is intriguing given that moist early Holocene conditions offered open-forest environments pre sumably attractive for foraging (Dramis et al. 2003). Many areas of Southwest Arabia were com paratively more arid and demographic stress may have arisen even when population densities were low (McCorriston et al. 2005a). But if agriculture was introduced, in part, by emigrants from the Middle Nile or the Levant, they would have encountered foragers at relatively low densities. If so, adapting agricultural strategies to new envi ronments (McCorriston 2006) may have been a more formidable obstacle than supplanting for agers from territories. Demographic circumstances must have shaped the available range of subsistence options, but if population pressure was the driving force behind transitions to agriculture why would these areas have taken so long to reach their supposedly cru cial carrying-capacity threshold(s)? Increased sedentism (potentially prompted by demographic stress) is associated with crop agriculture in some regions, including the Levant (Rosenberg 1998), yet connections between residential mobility and food production are diverse and complex (Garcea 2006; Rocek and Bar-Yosef 1998). African agropastoral ists such as the Nuer (Evans-Pritchard 1940), and Jebali agropastoralists in Dhofar (western Oman, see el-Mahi 2001; Janzen 1986), for example, were only temporarily tethered to fields. Widely distrib uted houses, tombs, and hearths in Wadi Sana sug gest a similar pattern of transhumant mobility may have prevailed during ancient times (Harrower 2008a). After the close of the Pleistocene, popula tion densities on either side of the Red Sea increased significantly (Brandt 1986; Edens and Wilkinson 1998) . However, as in the Levant, the most sub stantial population increases occur after, rather than before agriculture appears, and there is little evi dence an abrupt population pressure or "people packing" threshold (Binford 2001) necessitated transitions to food production. Coevolution Rindos's(1980,1984,1989) revolutionary model sidesteps the "why" question and explains the ori gins of agriculture as the inevitable culmination of long-term mutualistic relations between humans and plants. Although Rindos concentrated on plants, the same explanation might presumably be applied to animals; yet coevolution stumbles on the challenge of explaining why agriculture appeared when it did, and not before. Behavioral Ecology offers promising avenues to address the econom ics of different choices (e.g., Kennett and Winter halder 2006) but without evidence illustrating which plants and animals were most important to southern Red Sea foragers the relative cost-benefits of different options are difficult to assess (McCor riston 2006). Indeed, the overarching interpretation that agriculture is more advantageous than forag ing (Diamond and Bellwood 2003) is treacherous without reference to specific sets of contextualized potential choices. Rindos explains the spread of agriculture as a process of extensification in which farmers progressively supplanted foragers. Com parable demographic frontier models do help explain the spread of agriculture in Europe (e.g., Colledge et al. 2005; Price 2000; Rowley-Conwy 2004), yet cannot adequately account for the slow and sporadic appearance of agriculture in Africa (Marshall and Hildebrand 2002; Neumann 2003). Long histories of experience with local plants and animals, and associated coevolution, likely played a role in the adoption of Levantine and African domesticates, but wide north-south dif ferences in the timing of transitions to food pro duction leave assertions that domestication was gradual and inevitable begging for an explanation of differential timing. Some have suggested that because tef is seemingly so low yielding it must have been domesticated before Levantine crops arrived, otherwise it would not have been domes ticated at all (Butler 2002; Clark 1976; Harlan 1992; Stahl 1984). Yet this argument neglects to consider that contemporary populations continue to cultivate tef today. Tef must hold some attraction; possibil</page><page sequence="11">462 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 3,2010 ities include mitigation of vulnerability to drought, because it offers particularly "palatable and digestable" forage for oxen (McCann 1995:19), or because of culinary legacy and preference (Lyons and D'Andrea 2003; McCann 1995). Yams, enset, and noog are less visible in the archaeological record. McCann's (1995:83, 153-154) argument that cereal crops were preferred by elites in recent history because they could be more easily accu mulated and stored may similarly apply to the very ancient past and (along with preservation bias) may help account for the dominance of cereals in Pre Aksumite and Aksumite contexts. Yams and enset, for instance, are particularly attractive for house hold production as they can be left growing in the wild or garden plots until needed (Hildebrand 2003). Yet this makes them more difficult for elites to accumulate in comparison with cereals that must be harvested when ripe and can be stored for longer periods. Archaeologists therefore must not only consider opportunities of plant-people, animal-people mutualisms, but probably more importantly, how social dynamics induced intra community attractions and pressures to pursue potential symbioses. Social and Historical Factors Sociohistorical dynamics and changing notions of relations with nature offer the arguably most promising avenues toward more sophisticated explanations of southern Red Sea transitions to food production. Indeed, climate change, demo graphic stress, and coevolution each hold some util ity for explaining changing livelihoods but they neither adequately answer the "why not before?" question nor account for wide differences in the timing and nature of changes on either side of the southern Red Sea. Over many millennia, Holocene foragers encountered innumerable environmental opportunities and challenges, endured countless intervals of demographic stress, and eschewed potential agricultural mutualisms. While each of these factors likely played a role at different spa tiotemporal scales, they leave the story of food pro duction incomplete. Understanding the eventual adoption of domesticates requires reference not only to the aforementioned extrinsic factors but also to intrinsic sociohistorical dynamics that con tributed to, or more accurately resulted in, food production (cf. Cleuziou 2005). The resurgence of social factors in explanations of transitions to food production, particularly vis ible for instance in the Levant (e.g., Byrd 2005; Kuijt 2000; Verhoeven 2004), is recognizably born of shortcomings in exclusively climatic, demo graphic, and revolutionary explanations. Socio historical contexts, however, differ widely from region to region. Interregionally, Hayden has emphasized the role of accumulative personalities in co-opting food as a (if not the) primary instiga tor of both incipient social inequality and transi tions to agriculture (Hayden 1995, 2001, 2003). While Hayden (2003) contends that most domes ticates were exotic luxury foods produced for pres tige, rather than as staples, to accept his explanation one would need to determine why pressure to pro duce exotic foods never led to agriculture thou sands of years before (particularly given that foragers were long aware of agriculture in sur rounding regions). Instead, the advantages of emer gent food production, particularly in Southwest Arabia, appear to have been distributed throughout communities rather than exclusively to a handful of domineering individuals (Edens 2005). More over, explanations of emerging status differences in transegalitarian societies have thus far over looked the ethnographically most important avenue of tribal authority in Yemen?dispute mitigation. Tribal leaders in Yemen traditionally achieve authority predominantly through success as per ceived impartial arbitrators in disputes within and among confederacies, tribes, and subtribal social groups, and often were (and are) not particularly wealthy (Dresch 1984, 1986; Shyrock 1990; Varisco and Adra 1984). This traditional mode of tribal authority in Yemen contradicts notions that leadership in village societies is invariably con nected with accumulation of material wealth. Trajectories of history differ significantly on either side of the Red Sea, but in both cases inter vals during which domesticates appear are marked by significant social change. A ring of more than 40 cattle bucrania discovered at Shab Kheshiya in eastern Yemen (McCorriston et al. 2005b) demon strates the importance of communal gathering and feasting that bonded social groups from dispersed territories. At least some of the nearby circular upright slab structures likely served as periodically occupied homes for transhumant families but there is presently little evidence of social inequality or</page><page sequence="12">Harrower et al.] BEGINNINGS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ARABIA 463 differential wealth. Even with evidence from small villages in western Yemen (e.g., de Maigret 1990, 2002) archaeologists are hard-pressed to offer evi dence of significant intragroup status differences prior to the development of towns during the third millennium B.C. (Edens 2005). High circular (cairn) tombs dated to the late fourth and third mil lennia B.C. (incl. fields of thousands in Yemen's Ramlat as-Sab'atayn Desert; see Braemer et al. 2001), bear close resemblance to forms through out the Arabian Peninsula, in the Sinai, and south ern Levant (Steimer-Herbet 2004) suggesting long-range migration or at least dissemination of homologous mortuary practices. Incipient irriga tion agriculture is accompanied, at least in some locales, by the construction of such tombs along high visibility cliff lines (Harrower 2008a). These monuments marked changing land-water rights and patterns of territoriality important to the social viability of agriculture, but such tombs are lacking in some areas of western Yemen (Edens 2005) and in the Horn of Africa. Fourth and third millennium tombs and some settlements have yielded ceram ics, bronze awls, shell and stone beads, anthropo morphic and zoomorphic statuettes (Braemer et al. 2001; Edens and Wilkinson 1998; Fedele and Zac cara 2005; Steimer-Herbet et al. 2007; Wilkinson 2003) but there is presently little evidence that such stylized exotic goods were only available to a par ticularly wealthy subset of early agropastoral groups and they may have instead signified socioideational changes within and among com munities. Significant social changes accompanying tran sitions to agriculture are similarly apparent in the Horn of Africa during the third and first millennia (Finneran 2007:67-108). Cattle are known from rockshelter and open-air sites while crops appear in tandem with dramatic sociopolitical change during the rise of Pre-Aksumite and Ona kingdoms (D'An drea et al. 2008a; Fattovich 1990; Michels 2005; Schmidt and Curtis 2001; Schmidt et al. 2008b). The influences of Egyptian, Sudanese, andYemeni states are difficult to ignore (Munro-Hay 1991; Phillip son 1998). Temple of Hapshetsut reliefs, for exam ple, attest to myrrh, gold, ivory, baboons, monkeys, dogs, cattle, and other commodities brought from Punt (Phillips 1997:429^30). The reliefs depict Puntites with "cattle strolling and lying about" indi cating they were "cattle-herding pastoralists" (Phillips 1997:431). This is consistent with zooar chaeological evidence of domestic cattle in Ethiopia by this time, yet the reliefs offer no clear evidence of crop agriculture. How early Egyptians arrived as far south as the Gulf of Zula (Adulis) and how far they contributed to the spread of crops is challeng ing to determine. At least through rumor, the peo ple of ancient Punt must have been aware their distant neighbors were supported by more than hunted animals and gathered plants. Sites near Agor dat, Eritrea have long promised to help link the Mid dle Nile lowlands of Sudan with highlands of the Horn of Africa (Arkell 1954; Clark 1988, Fattovich 1988; Fattovich et al. 1984). Indeed, a test unit recently excavated at Kokan rockshelter (Eritrea) yielded Gash Delta and Pre-Aksumite type ceram ics that confirm the area as a gateway to the high lands (Brandt et al. 2008), but it remains to be established if crop agriculture (arguably as early as the third millennium at Gash Delta sites near Kas sala, see Fattovich 1993; Sadr 1991) did indeed spread to the highlands earlier than heretofore demonstrated. If crops had arrived in the highlands of Eritrea or Ethiopia by the third or second mil lennium, we yet lack evidence of them or settle ments they sustained. Later, near 800 B.C. during the Pre-Aksumite and Ona Culture periods, numer ous large towns supported by mixed farming devel oped between Aksum and Adulis, including Kohaito, Matara, Sobea, and Yeha (see Figure 1). The Pre-Aksumite period in Tigrai is marked by closer connections with South Arabia than with Egypt or the Levant, including Sabaic language inscriptions, architecture and incense burners dec orated with South Arabian iconography. Yet as Cur tis (2004:59) noted, emphasis on the most visible, exotic elements of the archaeological record has generated a skewed picture of first millennium B .C. cross-Red Sea interactions and more detailed under standings of non-elites lives are sorely required. Recent survey and excavation along the Red Sea/Gulf of Aden coast of Yemen has better docu mented second and first millennium B.C. societies likely in consistent contact with Africans (e.g., Dur rani 2005, Khalidi 2007). Bronze Age standing stones found at al-Midaman (Giumlia-Mair et al. 2002; Keall 1998) perhaps foreshadow those of Aksum, and at Sabir and MaTayba ceramics report edly show significant similarities with Sudanese types (Buffa 2002; Buffa and Vogt 1999; Vogt and</page><page sequence="13">464 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 75, No. 3, 2010 Figure 1. Map of Southwest Arabia and the Horn of Africa showing the sites mentioned in the text Sedov 1998), but corresponding agricultural settle ments dated to the third or early second millennium have yet to be documented in the highlands of the Horn of Africa. The influence of South Arabian states appears to have been somewhat more limited in Eritrea than in Ethiopia, and the prevalence of miniature Ona Culture "bulls' heads" icons (appar ently lacking in adjacent Tigrai) demonstrates the importance of unique, local ritual in the lives of early crop-rearing populations (Schmidt and Naty 2008). Agriculture could have appeared substan tially earlier than present evidence demonstrates, and may have first involved local domesticates, but given evidence of multiregional connections and local idiosyncrasies, it is nearly impossible to inter pret movements toward agriculture as entirely endogenous or exogenous. Conclusions Investigations of transitions of agriculture have tra ditionally concentrated in regions with the earliest evidence of plant and animal domesticates and in regions most readily accessible to archaeologists. Chronologies of change in the Levant and Europe, for example, are known in considerable detail but far less is known about areas on the ostensive peripheries of core regions. Continental to global scale explanations of transitions to agriculture have often framed the issue as one of revolutionary orig ination and subsequent spread (e.g., Diamond 1997), which fits well when domesticates are either indigenous or not yet, culturally, the origins of agri cultural lifeways are more difficult to locate in one or a few areas. Moreover, the recently better illus trated continuous and protracted nature of domes tication (e.g., Allaby et al. 2008; Fuller 2007; Zeder et al. 2006) depicts agricultural origins as more dif fuse in time and space than previously envisioned making it more challenging than anticipated to pin point precise places and times of domestication and directly connect morphological and genetic changes with specific changes in human action and culture. These considerations make it important not</page><page sequence="14">Harrower et al.] BEGINNINGS OF AGRICULTURE IN THE HORN OF AFRICA AND SOUTHWEST ARABIA 465 only to link genetic with archaeobotanical and zooarchaeological evidence but concordantly to continually reconsider the crucial "why?" and "why not before?" questions with respect to the diverse range of societal transformations interconnected with transitions to agriculture (Barker 2006; Zeder 2006). Rather than a revolutionary invention that swept through adjacent regions rapidly, the comparatively late appearance of agriculture along the southern Red Sea is striking. Current evidence indicates that plant domesticates appeared in the Horn of Africa roughly eight thousand years later than they did in the Levant, far more time than required if crop agri culture was an inevitably superior or demographi cally inevitable invention that inexorably transformed the lives of almost all those who encountered it. Given the relatively limited and geographically patchy coverage of research, new investigations will undoubtedly yield earlier evi dence of agriculture along the southern Red Sea but it is unlikely dates will ever approach those of the eastern Mediterranean. Culturally imbued prefer ences, experiences, and choices along with the regional availability and exposure to domesticates were both important, and the stereotypical alter natives that agriculture either originated in the north and spread south, or originated independently in Ethiopia underestimates the joint importance of local conditions and multiregional interaction. When viewed at continental-millennial scales, agriculture revolutionized global human histories, yet local-decadal scale perspectives depict transi tions to agriculture as multiplex histories shaped by the tandem influences of ecological, biological, demographic, cultural, and political factors, rather than as an invention for which local social geogra phies played a negligible role. Particularly in light of wide differences in the nature and timing of tran sitions to agriculture along the southern Red Sea, unique social histories arguably best answer the "why not before?" question. If so, investigations in less-known areas, where trajectories differ from general patterns, hold arguably as many new insights as continued research in areas where social chronologies and mechanisms of change are bet ter established. Indeed, the differential timing and expression of agriculture along the margins of the southern Red Sea and the importance of both local and interregional influences demonstrates that tra ditionally rigid lines between regions of origina tion and regions of spread substantially understate the complexities of agriculture's diverse begin nings.
