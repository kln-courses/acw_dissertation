<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Orientation of Animals. Kineses, Taxes, and Compass Reactions. By GOTTFRIED S. FRAENKEL and DONALD L. GUNN. Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1940: i-viii, 1-352, figs. 1-135. $6.00. THOUGH dealing essentially with the mechanism of ori- entation, with particular emphasis on the classification and nomenclature of responses, this needed volume on "The Orientation of Animals " has an evolutionary back- ground. The responses of animals in posture and move- ments are repeatedly stated to have adaptive significance. Through Part I orientations of increasing complexity are treated in turn:''ortho-kineses," involving different de- grees of hit-and-miss movement, varying with the in- tensity of the stimulus; "klino-kineses" (better "clino- kineses"?)--the trial-and-error responses in which the frequency of turning is the variable; "klino-taxes," in- cluding similarly irregular but directed movements; "tropo-taxes, "in which the definitely directed responses, operating through two receptors, are balanced; "telo- taxes"-similar reactions in which a single receptor dominates the action at any one time; "light compass reactions,' in which any response is at a certain angle to the stimulus; "dorsal (and ventral) light reactions" and "ventral earth reactions," causing the animal to orient itself at right angles to light and gravity. Experi- mental results with these and other types of orientations are treated in some detail in Part II, which seems more designed for the investigator than the student. The in- terpretations are on a mechanistic basis, though Loeb's reduction-to-the-simplest explanations of animal move- ments are not agreed to. The terminology is adopted, 604</page><page sequence="2">No. 761] REVIETWS AND COMMENTS 605 and in part propounded, in an effort (not wholly success- ful) to eliminate the anthropomorphic attitude. Some workers on animal behavior will no doubt feel that too much attention is given to the classification and nomen- clature of animal reactions. The authors freely admit that difficulties are involved in the identification of the many types of response according to their own scheme, which is a modification of KIUhn's classification of 1919. NEWS ITEMS THE ASSOCIATION FOPR THE STUDY OF SYSTEMATICS IN RELATION TO GENERAL BIOLOGY is continuing to function despite the conditions which war has brought to England. During the year the association issued its second report, for 1938-40, in which there are listed 14 investigational projects initiated or assisted by the Research Committee, and 4 symposia arranged or suggested by the association, including "A Discussion on Phylogeny and Taxonomy" published in the Proceedings of the Linnean Society (152, 1940: 234-55). Subsequently, on July 10, the asso- ciation held a joint meeting with the Linnean Society to discuss "Differences in the SyTstematics of Plants and Animals and their Dependence on Differences in Struc- ture, Function and Behaviour in the Two Groups. " Fol- lowing this symposium the annual general meeting was held. The association sponsored the publication of "The New Systematics,' reviewed in the AMarch-April number of THE AMERICAN NATURALIST. Genetics and speciation will be highlighted at the Christmas meetings in Dallas. The AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ZOOLOGISTS is arranging or participating in four Syin- posia: (1) Isolating Mechanisms; (2) Temperature ancd Evolution; (3) The Genetic Control of Embryonic Devel- opmuent; (4) Humnan Genetics. The annual address of the vice-president of Section F of the A. A. A. S. will be de- livered by Professor J. T. Patterson, who will speak on "Drosophila and Speciation."</page><page sequence="3">606 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST [VOL. LXXV THE GENETICS SOCIETY OF AMERICA (Th. Dobzhansky, president) will meet with the other biological societies affiliated with the A. A. A. S. in Dallas, Texas, from De- cember 29 to 31. The tentative program of the society includes- two sessions for the presentation of scientific paperss by the informal type of demonstration that has characterized the meetings of the society during recent years. One session will be devoted to the reading, of short papers (5 to 10 minutes), and another to the presentation of a small iiumber of papers selected by the program com- mittee for more extensive consideration. The lullclieon and business meeting is scheduled for December 30. Sev- eral other groups are joining with the geneticists in spon- soring a symposiumn dealing with isolating mechanisms. The list of speakers includes G. Ledyard Stebbins, Albert P. Blair, Alfred C. Kinsey and J. T. Patterson. Profes- sor Patterson has been asked to serve as chairman of the meeting. The tenth edition of the Records of the Society, containing the membership list, and the complete pro- gram together with preprints of abstracts of papers to be presented at the Dallas meetings will be sent to members of the society about December 15. Non-members can pur- chase copies of the Records from the secretary, B. P. Kaufnmann, Carnegie Institution of Washington, Cold Spring Harbor, New York. The annual meeting of the American Society of Natu- ralists, also at Dallas, will be highlig hted by the Presiden- tial Address by Dr. W. W. Cort, of Jolms Hopkins Uni- versity, oni " Human Factors in Parasite Ecology.'' This will be given at the Wednesday evening Naturalists' Dinner, December 31, 6: 30 P.M. Jointly with other or- ganizations, the Society is sponsoring an important syin- posium on Human Genetics, scheduled for 2: 00 P.I., December 31. The program is as follows: 1. The 11uman1811 Geiie. Laurience TI. Snyder, Ohio State Uniiver'sity. 2. lThe Genietics of HIuman Populations.. Heiluf H. Straiidskov, Ulid- versity of Chlicago.</page><page sequence="4">No. 761] REVIEWS AND COMMENTS 607 3. The Biometrical Approach in Human Genietics. Charles AV. Cotter- man, University of Michigan. 4.

In the passing of Victor Jollos the science of evolution has lost one of its leading modern contributors. This scienltist's eventful career, from his birth at Odessa in 1887 through wanderings and teachings in many lands until his death at Madison in July of this year, is briefly told in the September 19 issue of Science. He wxas trained by Robert Kvochl, and first attained prominence as a protozoologist. Perhaps the greatest of his contributions was to the conception of Da'uterimXoclifikatio'u en,. His work OIn the directive influence of external factors o01 mutation, however, has received the widest notice and the strongest criticism. It is of interest to learn that Jollos himself was unable to reprodulce his original results.</page></plain_text>
