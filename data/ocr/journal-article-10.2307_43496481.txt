<plain_text><page sequence="1">International Review of Modern Sociology Volume 39, Number 1, Spring 2013 WOMEN AND GIRLS LAST?: FEMALE VISIBILITY IN CHILDREN'S PICTURE BOOKS BY WHITE, BLACK, LATINO AND GAY-SYMPATHETIC AUTHORS Roger Clark, Julie Kessler and Allyssa Coon Rhode Island College We mark the fortieth anniversary ofhenore Weitzman et al.'s (1972) study that found women and girls to be essentially invisible in children's picture books of the late 1960s by examining female visibility in books by White, Black, Latino/a and Gay-Sympathetic authors of the early 21st century. We find female characters enjoy much more attention today than they did in the 1960s in books by all four sets of authors. We find that they are more visible, however, in books by current Black, Latino/a and Gay-Sympathetic authors than in books by White authors, in books by female authors than books by male authors, and in books by Black, Latina and Gay-Sympathetic women authors than by White women authors. We interpret these findings in terms of multicultural feminist theory and, particularly, the role assigned by that theory to women in helping marginalized communities "get over" oppression. It is forty years since Lenore Weitzman and colleagues published their classic (1972) piece, "Sex-Role Socialization in Picture Books for Preschool Children." They showed that children's picture books of the late 1960s depicted male and female characters in stereotyped ways and, worse, rendered female characters essentially invisible. Twenty years later, Clark et al. (1993) replicated and expanded Weitzman et al.'s study with an updated sample that, like Weitzman et al.'s, included winners and runners up of the Caldecott Medal, as well as winners and runners-up of the Coretta Scott King Medal, an award that had, since 1982, been given by the American Library Association to honor African- American illustrators. This enabled them to show that both conventional and Black illustrators of the late-1980s gave considerably more attention to female characters than did conventional illustrators in the earlier</page><page sequence="2">112 International Review of Modern Sociology period and that they did so, generally, in a less stereotyped way. Our goal here is not only to continue the focus on the visibility of female characters in well-regarded picture books, but also to update and expand the investigation to include not only well- regarded books by White illustrators (primarily Caldecott winners and runners-up) and Black illustrators (primarily King winners and runners-up), but also well-regarded books by Latino /a illustrators (PuraBelpré award winners and runners- up) and Gay-Sympathetic illustrators (picked from Saries' [2011] list). Overview Clark et al. (1993) made use of significant developments in the universe of children's book publishing and awards after Weitzman et al. 's (1972) publication. In 1965, Nancy Larrick had justifiably claimed that children's literature was an "all-white world." But by 1982, the American Library Association, which had sponsored the Caldecott Medal since 1938, began offering a Coretta Scott King Award for books by Black illustrators. So, by the late 1980s, Clark et al. were able to compare Caldecott and King award winners to discern differences between books by conventional (a small percentage of which was Black) and Black illustrators. In 1996, the American Library Association established the Pura Belpre Medal, for Latino and Latina illustrators, so it is now possible to examine another "not-completely-white world" within children's literature. Larrick might well have claimed that, in addition to being all white, children's picture books of the 1960s were completely heterosexual. This is no longer the case. Newman's (1989) Heather Has Two Mommies, published by Alyson Wonderland, was the first gay- themed children's book to register on the literary-critical and socio- controversial maps, but it hasn't been the last. The first decade of the new millennium has seen the publication of at least 75 gay- themed picture books (Sarle, 2011). So it is now possible to do true multicultural analyses of picture books - one that involves books by White, Black, Latino and Gay-Sympathetic writers and illustrators directed at White, Black, Latino and Gay-interested readers. A Gay-Sympathetic writer, in our view, is one who has written a book with significant gay themes, usually by focusing on a single-sex couple.</page><page sequence="3">Women and Girls Last? 113 There have also been significant developments in research on children's books and in feminist theorizing since the 1960s as well. At the time Weitzman et al. (1972) published, liberal feminism was the dominant version of feminism. It made sense that, in the context of liberal feminism, they should be checking whether male and female characters got equal time. The liberal feminist paradigm came to dominate social science approaches to children's books. By 2002, in fact, Clark (2002) identified 27 (of the 35) social science studies that employed equality of depiction as a standard for evaluating children's picture books. That number has grown. Perhaps the most comprehensive of the new pieces is McCabe et al.' s (2011) study, involving almost 6,000 picture books published in the U.S. between 1900 and 2000. McCabe et al. picked up on Weitzman et al.'s focus on the relative presence of female characters in picture books, suggesting, using Tuchman's (1979) phrase, that the absence of female characters represented a "symbolic annihilation" of women and girls from the genre, an annihilation that could have negative consequences for girls' self-esteem. McCabe et al. found that the relative presence of female characters declined between 1930 and 1970, or between the end of the first women's movement and the second, but that it increased after 1970. We do not learn from McCabe et al., however, whether the presence of female characters is similar in contemporary books authored (and illustrated) by artists of different ethnic backgrounds and sexualities. Nor do we learn whether the gender of the author makes any difference, a question that, to the best of our knowledge, remains unexploredin research generally. Clark et al.'s (1993) update relied on yet another version of feminism: Black feminism. By then, bell hooks (1984) and Patricia Hill Collins (1990) had provided nuanced, feminist answers to Rudine Sims' (1985) question of how the Black community in America "got over," surviving simultaneously oppressions of race, class, and, in the case of women, gender. These theorists helped lay a foundation for what is today more frequently referred to as multicultural feminism, concerned about "multiple systems" of oppression - such as sexism, racism, classism, nationalism and heterosexism - that affect the lives of different women in different ways, depending on their particular locations within these systems. Multicultural feminist theorists have different takes on what it</page><page sequence="4">114 International Review of Modern Sociology takes for their communities, women and girls to "get over." Thus, Black feminists emphasized the importance of techniques involving dialogue, caring, empathy and personal accountability and especially relationships among Black women; Chicana feminists, like Gloria Anzuldua (1987) and Cherrie Morago (1983), have sometimes stressed an independence from men and a close bond between women of different generations; and lesbian feminists (see Lorber, 2001) have again stressed close alliances between women, often as lovers, and a critique of heterosexual romantic love. All multicultural feminists, however, have stressed the centrality, not just the equality, of women. Consequently, one might expect that, to the degree that authors (and illustrators) are apt to convey multicultural feminist messages, they will feature female characters. The preceding considerations have led us to the following hypotheses about the relative presence of females in contemporary children's picture books: 1. Books by White, African American, Latino/a and Gay- Sympathetic authors and illustrators today will all make female characters more visible than books by White authors and illustrators in the 1960s. This hypothesis is based on the presumption that feminism, generally, has been successful in raising the consciousness of all artists and publishers about the need for female characters in children's picture books. 2. Books by African American, Latino/ a and Gay-Sympathetic authors and illustrators today will all make female characters more visible than books by White authors and illustrators today. This hypothesis is based on the assumptions that, while not all African American, Latino/a and Gay-Sympathetic authors will have multicultural feminist values, they are more likely to have them than White authors and that these values will inspire them to make female characters central. 3. Books by female authors will make female characters more visible than books by male authors, no matter what the race, ethnicity or sexual-sympathies of the authors. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that female authors are more likely than male authors to have feminist values.</page><page sequence="5">Women and Girls Last? 115 4. Books by African American, Latina and Gay-Sympathetic female authors will make female characters more visible than books by White female authors. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that African American, Latina and Gay-Sympathetic female authors are more likely to value making female characters central, and not just equal, to male characters in their narratives. Method Caldecott Medalists and runners-up from 2007 to 2011 are our source for White-authored and -illustrated books. The Caldecott is the most prestigious award given for children's picture books but it is not given just to White illustrators, so we have deleted books by known Black in certain analyses. (There were no Latino/ a authors among Caldecott illustrators.) Winning the Caldecott assures winners phenomenal sales (e.g., Clark, 1992: 6); consequently, Caldecott medalists are often among the picture books that pre- school children are most likely to read or have read to them. Whereas the Caldecott award is given only to illustrators of "outstanding picture" books, the Coretta Scott King and Pura Belpre awards are given to books that meet more specific goals. The King award, for instance, is given to African American illustrators whose works "promote understanding and appreciation of the culture of all peoples and their contribution to the realization of the American dream of a pluralistic society" (Coretta Scott King Award home page, 2011). And the Pure Belpré award honors the Latino/ Latinaillustrator whose "work best portrays, affirms, and celebrates the Latino cultural experience in an outstanding work of literature for children and youth" (PuraBelpré Award Home page, 2011). We used the Pura Belpre award winners and runners-up from 2007 to 2011 for our sample of Latino/Latina-illustrated books. To obtain a comparable numbers of main characters in the King books, books that from 2007 to 2011 tended to focus on generalized subjects, like illustrations of poems by Langston Hughes, rather than stories with clear-cut characters, we examined King award winners and runners-up from 2002 to 2011 for our sample of books by Black illustrators. Our Gay-Sympathetic books are from Patricia Saries (2011) webpage entitled "Gay-Themed Picture Books for Children." Saries' goal is to acknowledge books</page><page sequence="6">116 International Review of Modern Sociology that deal with the "experience of being a child in a gay family, or having a gay friend or family member" (Gay-Themed Picture Books Home page, 2011). We only examined books that had already been adopted by 100 or more libraries by the time of our study (Saries supplies data on library adoptions) andexamined all such books that had been published between 2003 and 2010. As a result, we ended up with closely examining 70 books: 18 Caldecotts, 26 Kings, 15 PuraBelprés and 11 Gay-Sympathetic books. We also present, for comparative purposes, data on 18 books analyzed by Clark, Lennon and Morris in 1993, the 18 Caldecott winners and honor books from 1967 to 1971. We have followed Clark et al. (1993) in their measurement strategies and employed four indicators of female visibility: the proportion of human single-gender illustrations depicting only female characters; the proportion of animal single-gender illustrations depicting only female characters; the proportion of books with no female character at all, and; the proportion of books with a central female character. We agree with Williams et al. (1987) and Clark et al. (1993) that it isn't always possible to definitively discern the gender of characters, even by studying illustrations and parallel tests. In Red Sings from the Treetops, Joyce Sidman (2009) creates a remarkably vivacious character and an apparent sibling, and neither character's gender identity is perfectly clear. The egg in Seeger 's (2007) First the Egg is even less clearly gendered. Two recent Gay-Sympathetic books, Newman and Thompson's (2009) Daddy, Papa, and Meand Mommy, Mama, and Me, feature infants (the titular "me's") of unidentifiable gender. With these exceptions, however, we made reasonably confident gender assignments. Our counts of single-gender human pictures and single-gender animal pictures were, for the three of us, correlated at the .93 level or more. We took the average of our three counts to be our final score for a book. We agreed on whether books had any female characters and whether they had a central female character over 90% of the time. When we disagreed, the decision made by two out of the three of us dictated how we coded the variable. We used two tests of significance here. When sample sizes are large enough (i.e., when we use pictures as units of analysis), difference of proportions are tested using traditional chi-square measures. When samples sizes are small (i.e., when we use books as</page><page sequence="7">Women and Girls Last? 117 units of analysis), Fisher's exact test is used for difference of proportion test. Results Weitzman et al. (1972) claimed that females were essentially invisible in children's picture books (Caldecotts) of the late 1960s. Hypothesis 1 suggests that books by white, Black, Latino/a and Gay-Sympathetic authors today will make females more visible than books by Caldecott authors in the late 1960s did. Table 1 supplies a good deal of evidence to support this hypothesis. Following Clark et al. (1993), we have defined human single-gender Table 1 Comparisons of Gender Visibility Caldecotts Caldecotts Kings PuraBelprés Gay- 1967-1971 Late 2000s 2000s 2000s Sypathetics 2000s Human Single- Gender Illustrations Total Number 186 356 245 111 76 Percentage Female 11.7 28.7a 41.9a 34.2a 34.2a Male/Female Ratio 7.5 2.5 1.4 1.9 1.9 Animal Single- Gender Illustrations Total number 96 31 5 1 48 Percentage Female 1.0 90.0a 0 0 14.6 Male/Female Ratio 95.0 0.2 - - 5.9 Books Total Number 18 18 26 15 11 Percentage with no 33.3 22.2 15.4 0bc 9.1 Female Character Percentage with 11.1 44.4b 57.7b 60b 63.6b Central Female Character Notes : a indicates this percentage is different from the 1960s Caldecotts figure at the .001 level; b indicates this percentage is different from the 1960s Cadecotts figure at the .05 level; Cindicates this percentage is different from the 2000s Caldecotts figure at the .05 level.</page><page sequence="8">118 International Review of Modern Sociology illustrations as ones depicting only male or female human characters. Clark et al. (1993) found that the percentage of such illustrations that depicted females was 11.7 per cent of all single- gender illustrations for the Caldecotts of the late 1960s. By the late 2000s, we find that this percentage was 28.7 for Caldecotts, substantially and significantly greater than it was in the late 1960s. The Kings, PuraBelprés and the Gay-Sympathetic books also made female characters substantially and significantly more visible by this measure than the 1960s Caldecotts. We defined animal single-gender illustrations as ones depicting only male or female animal characters. Only 1 per cent of animal single-gender illustrations in the 1960s Caldecottswere of females. Fully 90 per cent of the animal single-gender illustrations in the 2000s Caldecotts were of females, and 14.6 per cent of these illustrations in 2000s Gay-Themed books were. Both of these figures are substantially and significantly greater than that marking the 1960s books. For instance, Interrupting Chicken, a 2011 Caldecott winner, includes many images of the female protagonist, Chicken, as single-gender illustrations; there are only two images depicting Papa by himself, and the remaining images contain both characters. Similarly, the Gay-Sympathetic book, Uncle Bobby's Wedding, has many images of the protagonist, Chloe, alone or with her mother; the vast majority of the remaining images feature her uncle and his fiance, Jamie. Of the images in Uncle Bobby's Wedding, two-thirds of the single-gender illustrations depicted female characters. None of the 5 animal single-gender illustrations in the 2000's King books were of females and the one animal single-gender illustration in the PuraBelpré books was of a male. But neither of these results is substantially or significantly different from those of the 1960s Caldecotts and is a clear indication that animal single-gender illustrations don't play a large part in either the Kings or the PuraBelpres. Our other two indicators of female visibility, the percentage of books with no female character, and the percentage of books with a central female character, tell much the same story. Among 1960s Caldecotts, 33.3% of the books had no female character, higher than in any of the 2000s books: 22.2% of Caldecotts, 15.4% of Kings, 0% of PuraBelprés, and 9.1% of Gay-Sympathetic Books. Only the PuraBelprés have significantly fewer books without female</page><page sequence="9">Women and Girls Last? 119 characters than the 1960s Caldecotts, but the lack of significance is likely a function of small sample sizes. Despite these relatively small samples, however, all four of the categories of 2000s books were substantially and significantly more likely than the 1960s Caldecotts to have central female characters. In fact, while only 11% of the 1960s books had female central characters, around half of all categories of the 2000s books had them: 44% of Caldecotts did; 58% of Kings; 60% of PuraBelprés, and 64% of Gay-Sympathetic books. In addition to being fewer in number, the 1960s Caldecott females seem smaller in stature - less visible in this sense as well - than their 2000s sisters. For example, Sam of Evaline Ness's (196 7) Sam, Bangs and Moonshine, is essentially a passive agent in the resolution of conflict in the story; instead, she cries to her father, who then rectifies the mess she's created. By contrast, Rosa Parks (from Giovani and Collier's [2005] Rosa) is a pioneer of social change; by standing up (or sitting down, in this case) for her rights, Rosa helped spark the Civil Rights movement. Similarly, PuraBelpré (not the award, but the protagonist of Gonzalez and Delacre's [2008] The Storyteller's Candle: La Velita De Los Cuentos ) is the embodiment of hope for a community. As a bilingual librarian, she welcomed Puerto Rican families, wary of the library as an English-only zone, and established it as a safe place for learning. Hypothesis 2 posits that female characters will be more visible in today's books by African American, Latino/a, and Gay- Sympathetic illustrators and authors than in books by their white counterparts. This hypothesis is generally, though more weakly, supported by Table 1 as well. Thus, the percentages of human single-gender illustrations that are of females in the Kings (41.9%), the PuraBelpré (34.2%) and Gay-Sympathetic books (34.2%) are all greater than in recent Caldecotts (28.7%). None of these differences is statistically significant, however, unless one eliminates from the Kings Kadir Nelson's (2008) We are the Ship, a book that is a history of the Negro baseball league and therefore presents 44 pictures only of men. Then, the percentageof human single-gender illustrations that are of females jumps to 51.2% among the Kings, almost twice as great as the percentage in the Caldecotts and significantly different, at the .01 level, than that percentage. The two indicators based on books, rather than illustrations, as units of analysis tell the same story: that females are more visible in</page><page sequence="10">120 International Review of Modern Sociology the current Kings, PuraBelprés and Gay-Sympathetic books than the Caldecotts. Thus, while 22.2% of the current Caldecotts have no female character, only 15.4% of the Kings, 0% of the PuraBelprés and 9.1% of the Gay-Sympathetic books do so. (Only the difference between the PuraBelprés and the Caldecotts is statistically significant, however.) And, while 44.4% of the Caldecotts have a central female character, fully 57.7% of the Kings, 60% of the PuraBelprés and 63.6% of the Gay-Sympathetic books do so. (None of these differences is statistically significant, however.) In general, once again, the relative stature of the current Caldecott femalesadds to their relative invisibility vis-à-vis King, PuraBelpré and Gay-Sympathetic females. We don't learn very much, for instance, about the nameless protagonist in Swanson and Krommes's (2008) The House in the Night (a Caldecott). She's a child who requires putting to sleep. By contrast, Thunder Rose of Nolen and Nelson's (2003) Thunder Rose, is fierce, independent and heroic, able to stop stampedes and thunder storms with her wit and physical prowess. The PuraBelpré book, Me, Frida, tells the story of FridaKaWö and her journey to become a famous artist. Frida's name alone is evocative; the little girl's in The House in the Night is not mentioned.Meema and Marmeeof Polacco's (2009) In Our Mother's House (a Gay-Sympathetic book) are also women who make an impression. The story is told from the point of view of one of their adopted children, describing how happy and loving their family is. Most of their neighbors are accepting; however, one neighbor is disapproving of their family, headed, as it is, by two women. Meema and Marmee treat everyone respectfully, even their scowling neighbor. The couple's quiet strength helps carve a respected niche in the community. Indeed, while the female characters depicted in Kings, PuraBelprés, and Gay-Sympathetic stories are generally substantial, only one Caldecott female character, Harriet Tubman from Weatherford's (2006) Moses, is a mover or a shaker; andMoses was created by a Black, not White, author. The only indicator on which we found no support for Hypothesis 2 was the percentage of animal single-gender illustrations that were of females. 90% of these, within the 2000s Caldecotts, were of females, while 0% of them within Kings were, 0% within PuraBelpréswere, and only 14.6% within Gay-</page><page sequence="11">Women and Girls Last? 121 Sympathetic books were. The Kings, PuraBelprés and the Gay- Sympathetic books also made female characters substantially and significantly more visible by this measure than the 1960s Caldecotts had by this measure. In fact, in no King or PuraBelpré book were animals central characters, so, in some ways, this disparity is misleading. It is especially misleading, for our purposes - which are to distinguish White-illustrated books from others - because one of our two Caldecotts that were about animals, Jerry Pinkney's (2009) The Lion and the Mouse, is by a Black author /illustrator and contains the majority of the Caldecott animal single-gender illustrations. 94% (17 of 18) of this book's single-gender animal illustrations are of the mouse, which, as it turns out, is the mother of several baby mice.Because only 85% (11 of 13) of the remaining single-gender animal illustrations in Caldecotts are of females, there are actually slightly more single-gender animal illustrations in Caldecotts by Black author/illustrators than by White author/ illustrators. Hypothesis 3 holds that books by female authors will make female characters more visible than books by male authors, no matter the race, ethnicity or sexual sympathies of the author. Table 2 provides strong support for this hypothesis. In fact, on the two key indicators of female visibility, the percentage of human single- gender illustrations that are of females and the percentages of books with central female characters, the data are unambiguous. Caldecotts, Kings, PuraBelprés and Gay-Sympathetic books by female authors all have substantially and significantly higher percentages of human single-gender illustrations that are female (45%, 61%, 44% and 47%, respectively) than books by male authors (19%, 25%, 10% and 17%, respectively). And the same books by female authors are substantially more likely to have female central characters (50%, 44%, 64% and 66%, respectively) than books by male authors (30%, 18%, 50% and 50%, respectively), even though none of these differences is significant at the .05 level. The data are only slightly more equivocal on our other two measures of visibility, the percentage of animal single-gender illustrations that are female and the percentage of books that are without a female character at all. In the case of the former indicator, the equivocation exists only because King and PuraBelpré books don't have enough animal illustration for comparison. In the case of the Caldecotts and</page><page sequence="12">122 International Review of Modern Sociology the Gay-Sympathetic books, the differences support the hypothesis, and the difference for the Gay-Sympathetic books (2.6% of images in male-authored books are of female animals, while 100% of such illustrations in female-authored books are) do so at a statistically significant level. In the case of the indicator involving the percentage of books without a female character, there is no difference between the PuraBelpré books by male and female authors (all books have female characters) or for Gay-Sympathetic books (84% of all books have female characters). But the differences for Caldecotts and King books are in accord with the hypothesis (30% of Caldecott books by males don't have female characters, while only 12.5% of Caldecotts by female authors don't have them; for Kings, the figures are 45% and 11%). Hypothesis 4 suggests that books by African American, Latina and Gay-Sympathetic female authors will make females more visible titan books by White female authors. The majority of the relevant comparisons available in Table 2 support this hypothesis, especially once we take into account that one of the Caldecotts, Carole Boston Weatherford's (2006) Moses, is by an African- American author. Once this adjustment is made, and the 13 illustrations of Harriet Tubman are associated with Black authors and not White ones, the percentage of human single-gender illustrations that are of females becomes only 37% for books authored by White female writers (rather than the 45% reported in the table for Caldecott female authors), that for Black female authors becomes 63%, for PuraBelpré female authors, 44%, and for Gay-Sympathetic authors, 47%. Those in books authored by minority authors have a higher percentage of such images, with the ones by Black authors having a significantly higher percentage. Similarly, a higher percentage of books by Black female authors (47%), Latina authors (64%) and Gay-Sympathetic female authors (66%) have female main characters than books by White authors (43%), once Weatherford's book is treated as it should be (a book by a black author) though none of these differences is statistically significant. Moreover, a higher percentage of the books by White female authors (14%) have no female character than the books by Black female authors (about 10%) and by PuraBelpré female authors (0%), even though this percentage is actually lower than it is for Gay-Sympathetic authors (16%).

Once again, there is a difference in stature that complements the difference in literal presence. Among the Caldecott female characters by female authors, the little girl in The House in the Night is nameless, the Grandma in A Couple of Boys Have the Best Week Ever is minor (and the only female character in the book), and Trixie, from Knuffle Bunny Too, reminiscent of Sam in Sam, Bangs and Moonshine of the 1960s, compels her father to retrieve her favorite stuffed animal after a mix up at schooLConversely, the female characters in the Kings, PuraBelprés, and Gay-Sympathetic books</page><page sequence="14">124 International Review of Modern Sociology by female authors stand out more. Bessie in Talkirí About Bessie (a King) is the first female aviator. Frida (from Me, Frida, a PuraBelpré) is an influential artist. Molly, from Molly's Family (a Gay- Sympathetic book), embodies tolerance and acceptance. Although Caldecotts by white female authors do present interesting, engaging stories, non-white female authors are more likely to present interesting, engaging female characters. Discussion Consistent with Clark et al.' s (1993) and McCabe et al.' s (2011) studies, we find that there's been a substantial increase in the visibility of female characters in children's picture books since the 1960s. This increase holds for award-winning books by White, Black, Latino/a and Gay-Sympathetic authors and illustrators, at least in comparison with the primarily White authored and illustrated Caldecotts of the 1960s. The "symbolic annihilation" of girls and women, an annihilation that concerned Gaye Tuchman (1979), is no longer an issue in children's picture books, as fully half of the 2000s books we examined featured central female characters. We believe, as Clark et al. (1993) and McCabe et al. (2011) did, that this achievement reflects the consciousness raising entailed by the second-wave women's movement, whose attention Weitzman et al. (1972) directed to children's books. Their study shone the light of feminist criticism on an industry that, since the end of the first women's movement, had gone unlit. The rest of this paper expands previous findings by showing that: (a) books by women authors, whether White, Black, Latina or Gay-Sympathetic, are substantially more likely to make female characters central, than their male counterparts, (b) books by Black, Latino/a and Gay-Sympathetic illustrators are substantially more likely to feature female characters than books by White illustrators and, (c) books by Black, Latina and Gay-Sympathetic female authors are substantially more likely to feature female characters than books by White female authors. We had anticipated these latter findings through our reading of multicultural feminist scholars, each of whom had suggested a special place for women in helping their communities "get over" oppression based upon their marginal status in American society. In general, we find the female characters created by Blacks, Latinas</page><page sequence="15">Women and Girls Last? 125 and Gay-Sympathetic women to be not only more numerous than those created by Whites and White women, but also more impressive in their stature and in the marks they make on the world. Part of the reason for this difference is the relative paucity of adult human characters in books written by Whites and White women. (There are substantially and significantly more adults in Kings, PuraBelprés and Gay-Sympathetic books than in Caldecotts.) This is partly because the Caldecott committee is apt to honor pure fantasy, whether it be focused on anthropomorphic chickens (in Interrupting Chicken), wild and crazy letters (in Gone Wild: An Endangered Alphabet), or pure philosophy (in First the Egg). But it's also because the Caldecotts are simply more likely to feature children, including the little girl in The House in the Night. The adults featured in both the Kings and the PuraBelprés are very likely to have been historical figures, genuine icons. These include, among the Kings, Martin Luther King Jr., Duke Ellington, Bojangles, Rosa Parks, Bessie Coleman, Langston Hughes (in several recent Kings), participants in the Negro Baseball League, various male and female jazz musicians, including Bessie Smith, and Harriet Tubman. The lost boys of Sudan are, perhaps, icons-in- waiting in Williams' (2008) Brothers in Hope. Among the PuraBelpres, the icons are FridaKahlö (a couple of times), Diego Rivera, PuraBelpré and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. There is only one such icon among the Caldecotts (Jen Bryant's William Carlos Williams in her [2008] A River of Words, who is not an African American created by a African American. (There are three such icons presented by African Americans among the Caldecotts: Dave the potter, Harriet Tubman and Henry, who traveled North in the freedom box). Almost as if to suggest that an icon isn't required to create anoutsized character in a King or PuraBelpré, however, Jerdine Nolen and Kadir Nelson gave us Thunder Rose, the rootenest, tootenest, African American cowgirl the West has never seen. One can find Kings and PuraBelprés in which characters aren't larger than life, but the rule seems to be: no Mr. or Ms. Cellophanes need apply. Gay-Sympathetic authors also create noticeable characters, and particularly noticeable female characters, by depicting adult same- sex couples that are admirable and interesting. Here the goal, we presume, is to make young readers with same-sex parents feel a</page><page sequence="16">126 International Review of Modern Sociology little less different, a little more mainstream. Every book is about children with such parents (or adult relatives), whether they be guinea pigs, penguins or, as they are in most cases, humans. Some of these, like Bertie and Lee, as they pursue adventure in the jungle in King &amp; King &amp; Family, are fascinating in every way, but most, like Meema and Marmee, are simply notable for their affection andstrength of character. As a rule, then, the characters created by the Black, Latino/a and Gay-Sympathetic authors and illustrators in our sampleare intended to help young readers see what it takes to successfully deal with oppression. At times, and depending on their point of view, these creators provide historical models of what it once took; at times, they focus on making what may seem unusual in their readers' lives seem moretypical. That this involves the creation of more visible female characters, especially when the authors and illustrators are themselves female, may not be a great surprise, after all. Nonetheless, one of the major findings of the current research is the degree to which female authors are more likely to create female characters than male authors, whatever their race, ethnicity or sexual sympathies. We anticipated this finding in terms of women's greater likelihood of being attuned to various modes of feminist thought, though we didn't anticipate the strength of the relationship between gender of author and the presence of female characters. It is not clear whether this relationship has always existed in the production of children's picture books, but itsstrength in our sample of 21sł century books suggests that gender of author needs to be included in any subsequent studies of the presentation of gender in children's literature.
