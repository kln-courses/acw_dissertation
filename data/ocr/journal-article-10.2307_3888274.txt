<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Earlier Stone Age Settlement of Scandinavia by Grahame Clark. Cambridge, Cambridge University Press. 1975. During the Late-Glacial period, about 10000-8000 B.C., when part of Scandinavia was still covered by ice, the first settlers were nomadic reindeer hunters. With the climatic and vegetation zones shifting upwards there was a rather rapid change of the economy from one based on the reindeer and open tundra to one adapted to a forest environment, an adaptation that for archaeologists marks the transition in this part of the world from Upper Advanced Palaeolithic to Meso- lithic. When temperatures reached their Post-Glacial maxima and deciduous forests became dominant, conditions existed for the introduction and spread of mixed farming, including cereal agriculture, about 3500-3000 B.C. In the first chapter Clark discusses the basic concepts used in reconstructing the story-the ecological approach, material culture, territories, subsistence and seasonality, settlements, stability and change. In the second chapter he describes the changes in the physical environment: the rise in sea- level, accompanied by recovery in the land mass as the weight of ice was lifted, and the introduction of new plants and animals. The third chapter deals with the Late-Glacial settlement of Denmark and Scania (southern Sweden). This was the period of the first reindeer hunters known from settlements at Hamburg and Ahrensburg in northern Germany, at Lyngby and Bromme in Denmark and at Segebro in Sweden. The industries from the German sites consisted of a variety of blade tools including endscrapers, burins and tanged or shouldered points, but no axe or adze blades. Barbed harpoon heads were also made of reindeer antler. The industries from Denmark and Scania contained a higher proportion of burins but were otherwise similar to the German ones. Chapter 4 deals with Early Post-Glacial settlement in south Scandinavia. The period is divided into Pre- Boreal (before 7000 B.C.), Early Boreal (7000-6300 B.C.) and Late Boreal (6300-5600 B.C.) with the majority of settlements in Denmark, but also some in Scania and on the island of Bornholm. More is known about the technology of this period as many sites have been discovered in bogs. The flint industries reflect on the one hand continuity with the earlier traditions and on the other innovation stemming from adapta- tion to a forest environment. The bifacially flaked axe or adze has become recognized as an explicit index of adaptation to the new, forested environment. Among the microlithic tools are narrow drills and arrow- 64</page><page sequence="2">points and barbs. Bows and arrows from this period have been recovered in bogs. Elk antlers or aurochs bone were used for mattock heads. Wood was also used for dugout canoes and paddles. Some of the latter have been discovered in the region. The archaeological material available from Pre- Boreal and Boreal times in southern Scandinavia shows that men used remarkably similar equipment for coping with their material needs over the whole extent of the north European plain. It appears that the Late-Glacial to Post-Glacial transition was marked by a strong swing in hunting land mammals from harpoons to spears and arrows, even if harpoon heads did survive especially for seal- hunting. Elk, red deer, aurochs and wild pig were hunted and the hunters now had dogs. Fish-hooks of bone show the importance of fishing, especially of pike. From this period come the first finds of symbolic art in the form of engravings on antler and bone objects. Fine incisions were generally used but also deeper grooves and sometimes also pattern of drilled pits. The motifs comprise geometric patterns, e.g. mesh design, animal figures and anthropomorphic figures, often in combination. Small amber carvings of animals probably also belong to this period. This art group forms part of a coherent tradition rooted in south Scandinavia but stemming from much more ancient Advanced Palaeolithic sources. Chapter 5 describes Atlantic settlement in south Scandinavia and the old Maglemose/Ertebblle dicho- tomy. The former culture covers what has been described above while the latter, which has mainly been recovered from kitchen middens, has now been divided into the Kongemose, Vedbaek, Bloksbjerg and Ertebblle phases covering approximately the period between 5600 B.C. and 3200 B.C. The main differences between the Maglemose and the Ertebolle industries are as follows. Microliths abound in the former but are virtually absent in the latter as is also the case with barbed spear-heads of antler or bone. Pottery, on the other hand, occurs only in Erteb6lle sites as do also perforated stone axe blades. The pottery is of some interest to South Africans as it rather resembles Strandloper pottery found on the South African coast. The potsherds have been dated from between 3800 and 3600 B.C. and come from bag- shaped vessels with pointed or nippled bases and with plain, everted rims which are often milled. The pots were built with coil technique and the outside was smoothed with a flat pebble. There are also some shallow, oval vessels interpreted as lamps. The final chapter discusses the Older Stone Age colonization of the Fennoscandian Shield, i.e. Norway, Finland and northern Sweden. The book is fully illustrated and documented with many maps and tables. It provides a balanced picture of the economy of the first settlers and their descendants in an area the archaeological past of which has been exceptionally well investigated and documented. The colonization of Scandinavia is considered in its European context, but the main emphasis lies on the process of change and the continuity of settlement in the territory itself.
