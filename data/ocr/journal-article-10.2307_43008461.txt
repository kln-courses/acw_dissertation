Most taken of up this by issue ten of articles Science about Mag the is taken up by ten articles about the crown of thorns starfish, a marine or- ganism that is destroying sections of the Great Barrier Reef along the north- eastern coast of Australia. The starfish is a problem throughout the Pacific and Indian Ocean basins, from Mada- gascar in the west, to the coast of Cen- tral America and Baja California in the east, but the worst ravages are found in Australia and nearby Pacific islands. The dramatic rise in starfish numbers observed over the past two decades has been attributed mainly to two anthropomorphic causes. First, inter- ference with coastal river systems has increased pollution along the Reef, and many believe, without being able to* establish a definite connection, that this is the root cause of the problem. Their 472 JCST May 1988</page><page sequence="2">APSTRACTg opponents dismiss this as "greenie" hysteria, pointing out that pollution in the area is extremely low by world standards, and that evidence of reef destruction in proximity to settlement is highest simply because that is where most of the observers are! More significant, perhaps, is evidence that the only known predator of the starfish has been systematically re- moved from the reef by shell collec- tors. This is the giant triton, the kind of shell in which divers get their feet caught in those exciting Pacific movies. The triton is, even in undisturbed areas, quite rare, so it is hard to see how it played more than a minor role in con- trolling starfish populations. A great deal of research is underway in Australia to find out more about coral growth and starfish pr√©dation. Even geologists are involved, testing the theory that periodic "plagues" of starfish are a historic phenomenon. Support is available for this we-just- have-to-live-with-it school of thought, but the issue is not beyond doubt. De- struction of coral is seldom complete, and not much is known about survival and regrowth rates of coral polyps. Meanwhile, amateur groups and navy divers patrol the reef, injecting poisons into starfish found in large colonies. The predators seem to release a pher- omone when they feed, thus attracting more starfish to a good browsing spot, so chemists and biologists are having a field day with their studies of the com- plex life cycle and behavior of the star- fish. Government support for ecologi- cal research of this kind is running at about $1 million a year, so whatever else the crown of thorns starfish is doing, it's keeping a lot of Australian scientists in jobs! - Ian Rae , associate professor of chem- istry , Monash University, Clayton , Victoria 3168, Australia</page></plain_text>
