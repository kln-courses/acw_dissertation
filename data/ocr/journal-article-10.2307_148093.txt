<plain_text><page sequence="1">PREHISTORIC FIGURINES FROM CORINTH (PLATES 33-44) T HE NEOLITHIC and Early Helladic figurines in the following catalogue, including one or two pieces that may not properly speaking be figurines, are the fruits of nearly ninety years of excavations by the American School of Classical Studies at the main site of Old Corinth and its outliers.1 The total number of figurines to date is 69, of which 10 lost or sent to the National Museum of Athens by the end of the Second World War were pub- lished by Mrs. Walker Kosmopoulos.2 Of this number 32 human and 5 animal figurines are more or less certainly Neolithic and 19 are Early Helladic (EH); 2, 39 and 40, could be either. The reasons for the chronological attribution of each figurine, based on context, tech- nique, or as a last resort typology, are given in the catalogue. In the case of those for which such evidence is particularly tenuous, the probability of the date given is estimated accord- ing to the frankly subjective opinion of the writer. 1 The idea of publishing all the Neolithic and Early Helladic figurines together in one article was very kindly suggested to me by Dr. C. K. Williams, II, Director of the Corinth Excavations. A few have been previously published in greater or lesser detail but are included in the present catalogue for the sake of com- pleteness. I am most grateful to Dr. Williams for his advice and comments on the article and to Dr. N. Booki- dis, Secretary of the Corinth Excavations, for her patience and help in locating all the information available about the figurines. The photographs are by I. Ioannidou and L. Bartzioti.

PHELPS During the Neolithic and EH periods the cultural separation of the Peloponnese from central Greece, and even more so from Thessaly and Macedonia, that is apparent in the different regional styles of pottery is just as marked in the field of coroplasty. From its considerable, albeit commonly mixed prehistoric deposits, Corinth has produced 10 Middle Neolithic (MN) and some 17 Late Neolithic (LN) clay human figurines; the corresponding figures for the Franchthi Cave are, pending the final publication, 5 Early Neolithic (EN), 14 MN, 13 LN, and 6 Final Neolithic (FN) figurines,3 but no more than a handful is known from the other Peloponnesian Neolithic sites. From Thessaly, by contrast, Hour- mouziadis in 1974 reported a total of 599, including 246 from Prodromos alone,4 but ex- cluding 227 from Achilleion5 and others found since then. A large number, if not the ma- jority of these, are EN in date,6 although they continue to be common in the Middle Neo- lithic, while EN figurines are scarcely known from the Peloponnese.7 There are, furthermore, typological differences between the figurines from Thessaly and the Peloponnese, including the absence from the latter region of the schematic piriform Proto-Sesklo figurines, coffee-bean eyes, figurines seated on stools, and male figurines, to name a few more obvious features and types that are characteristic in Thessaly. On the other hand the very typical Peloponnesian MN half-legs or half-figurines with hands on thighs, if that is what they are, are virtually unknown in Thessaly, although Macedonia has some interesting parallels. The chief difficulty when discussing the typology of prehistoric Greek figurines lies in the fragmentary condition of most of them combined with their great variety and consid- erable regional differences. 1 is a classic incised "Rod Head" as defined by Nandris, who lists only three others from Greece but 30 in the Balkans.8 Some of them resemble each other to a fair degree while others do not.9 The non-incised Rod Heads, of which there are none at Corinth, are much commoner, and they, too, display considerable diversity in the treatment of the head, eyes, and nose.10 Few of them are associated with bodies; the few I Talalay, table 5-1. Dr. Talalay has applied the methods of attribute and cluster analysis to the body of Neolithic anthropomorphic figurines from southern Greece, with interesting results. The groups to which the Corinth figurines that were analysed were assigned are given in the Talalay reference for each entry in the Catalogue. 4 Hourmouziadis, p. 16, fig. 1. M.

It is interesting that four of the five EN fragments are lower legs and only one a torso (FC 190).

Certainly it is significant that whereas 10 as- sorted MN Rod Heads have been published from Chaironeia, only 4 or 5 are known from the much greater body of MN material excavated at Corinth, Franchthi, Lerna, and Akrata. ' 2 The simple fact is that long columnar or slightly tapering necks-cum-heads appear in different periods on different bodies and with different features and do not in themselves reflect a cultural horizon. For an illustration of this, one has only to look at the marble head from Alepotrypa,'3 which from its context can hardly be earlier than LN, or the long- necked Eleusis figurine, which was reported by Tsountas as having come from a burial at Mandra,'4 thus making an MN date unlikely, because no sites of this period are known in the region. A wide variety of typological traits, including different arm forms, body propor- tions, and postures, can be shown to be contemporary, while similar ones occur in different chronological periods. 15 It seems to me doubtful, although often attempted, that one can, on the basis of a few shared characteristics, assign to one category figurines whose date and provenance are unknown or which come from widely separated regions. The only two kinds of figurines from Corinth that might reasonably claim the status of a class are the Neolithic half-legs and the EH slaughtered animals. Both have limited and known chronological and geographical distributions. Some 15 or more half-legs are known from the Peloponnese, all but one of which are MN in date: 7 from Corinth, 2 from Akrata,'6 2 from Asea,'7 3 from Lerna,'8 and at least 3 or 4 from the Franchthi Cave;'9 there is also one instance from Lerna of a pair of legs still united, which may belong to this class.20 The rest are all single leg-and-buttock fragments and vary in their proportions from the two Asean examples with exaggerated buttocks and vestigial legs to the long leg and small buttock of Akrata (museum inv. no. 1021). They are all either broken or terminate naturally at the waist except for Akrata (museum inv. no. 985), which preserves part of the torso. The two legs from Asea certainly, and Akrata no. 1021 probably, were complete entities; the larger Asea leg has no break at the waist, and on " Cf.

PHELPS the other the break is so small in area and in such a position that one cannot see how it could have supported any kind of torso.21 Furthermore, the inner medial surfaces of both were finished before firing in the same way as the rest of the leg; one with a low burnish and the other with a thin overslip in the common Urfirnis manner.22 Akrata no. 1021, like the two from Asea, carries no traces of having had a hand attached to the thigh and shows signs of polish on the medial surface. Akrata no. 985, with part of a torso preserved and vestiges of a hand resting on the thigh, also may have been separated from its other half before firing, because the quite flat medial surface appears to the eye to have traces of a thin, transparent slip, and the pubic-triangle groove looks as if it had been touched up, if not wholly made, after separation in a leather-hard state.23 These features of the Akrata and Asea half-legs have been stressed here because they show that half-legs were being deliberately manufactured in the Peloponnese during the MN period, although in the case of the Corinth examples it is difficult to tell from simple inspection whether they were separated accidentally or intentionally from their mates. The only two legs for which there are perhaps indications of prefiring separation are 10 and 11. The evidence is discussed in the catalogue below, but without a technological examination no firm opinion can be expressed about them. Nevertheless, whether the legs were separated before or after firing, they suggest both from the nature of the break and the extent of the medial grooving that the separation may have been deliberate rather than accidental. First, the surface of the break is always rela- tively flat and smooth, and the edges of the break are clean, in contrast to the LN figurines that have broken vertically down the middle, like 19, 20, and 23. It may be argued that this flat surface at the break is due to the method of manufacture, using separate cores for differ- ent parts of the body, which were pressed together and then invested with a layer of clay on which the final modeling and decoration were executed.24 If the two leg cores were pressed together while in a semidry state, the clay would not bond well and would thus be liable to fracture at the joint, a phenomenon sometimes observable in the case of handles, bases, and coil-made pots.25 This argument, however, does not explain the extreme flatness and smoothness of the joining surfaces or the fact that the upper breaks at the torso, also pre- sumably made from a separate core, are always ragged and uneven. It is also unlikely that such technically expert and sophisticated workers in clay as the MN potters would be so consistently incapable of achieving a stronger bond between the leg cores had they so wished. 21 Cf. Talalay, p. 158 for a similar comment on FC 122 from Franchthi. 22 These features are clearly visible in Phelps, fig. 78:1, 2. 23 Cf. Talalay, pp. 155-156, 174-175. 24 E.g., G. F.

This feature is not necessary merely to indicate the division between the legs, nor is it appar- ent in contemporary figurines from sites north of the Peloponnese, like Chaironeia, Eutre- sis, Elateia, or Thespiai.26 It would, however, be consistent with an intention to split the figurine into two halves.27 Apart from one or two possible half-legs from Boiotia, including that published by Bass from Thespiai,28 the only sites in the north that have produced anything comparable to the Peloponnesian half-legs are Servia, where two joining halves of a figurine originally held together by a wooden peg were found in MN levels,29 and Nea Nikomedeia, where a com- plete pegged-leg figurine was found in EN levels.30 These examples, however, are not really the same as the Corinthian half-legs, because the legs were clearly not intended in the first place to exist as separate entities. Another distinctive feature of the Peloponnesian legs is that, apart from the three excep- tions mentioned above, they all, including the joined pair from Lerna, bear either the ves- tiges of hands or fingers on the front of the upper thigh, or else scars where the hand has flaked off altogether. This shows that they had originally been modeled as complete stand- ing figurines with arms curving downwards free of the body.31 Standing figurines with the arms in this position appear to be very uncommon, and the only ones known to me outside the Peloponnese are two from Eutresis32 and one from Hacilar.33 Thus, these standing MN figurines with their hands on their thighs, and in most cases, we think, made intentionally to be separated into two independent halves, would seem to represent a Peloponnesian class of figurine as native to the region as was the contemporary Urfirnis pottery. There remains another problem about these figurines: we do not know what the torsos and heads were like, and there is no more reason to assume that these were all alike than that all the half-legs were fashioned as such deliberately or had one single function. Of the four contemporary torsos that have been published, the one from Asea34 has stub arms, and 2 from Corinth preserves the broken stump of the right arm projecting outwards and down- wards from the shoulder; the other two from Corinth are too fragmentary to tell what kind 26 E.g., Theochares (footnote 11 above), pl. 35; Caskey and Caskey, "Eutresis," pl. 52:1.33, 34. 27 Cf.

It is possible that 2's arms did extend downwards to the thighs in the position described above, and it may well have belonged to a pair of half-legs; it is broken jaggedly along a horizontally incised line that may be meant to mark the waist, although it is anatomically too high, and the torso is too wide at this point to match the upper break on any of the half-legs.35 What can be said of the two torsos on which the breasts are preserved (2 and the one from Asea) and of all the legs (except for the two from Asea, the published one from Franchthi already cited, and perhaps 9) is that while the female characteristics are clearly delineated, they are, if any- thing, under- rather than overemphasized. The two from Asea, which are atypical in other respects, are just exaggerated buttocks with vestigial legs and inconspicuously incised pubic triangles; the Franchthi specimen is a fat, but not exaggerated, buttock in a sitting posture; 9 is too incomplete for one to judge. The purpose of these figurines is anybody's guess, the bibliography on the subject is considerable, and I shall not make any surmises here,36 but it may be relevant in this context to note the small stone pendant in the form of a pair of legs from an early MN level at Franchthi.37 The other group of Corinth figurines sufficiently specialized in form and circumscribed in date and range of distribution to qualify as a class is that of the EH II animal figurines. They are 19 in number; most of them are fragmentary and some very worn, but identifiable features show that both cattle and sheep were represented. Most of them are painted with vertical stripes, two are spotted, and the rest have an over-all coating of Urfirnis paint. Of the 15 preserved body fragments, 9 clearly represent slaughtered and gutted animals; these each have a more or less deep, longitudinal belly cut, running from the forelegs to the hind legs, and deep gashes around the throat, showing the method of slaughter. Of the remaining animal bodies, 4 are without cuts, and the other 5 fragments are heads or other parts. Published parallels to the Corinthian slaughtered carcasses are few and confined to the Peloponnese: there is a bull from Tiryns with a slit belly,38 and 3 are reported from Lerna 35See footnote 28 above for complete figurine. 36 Much has been written on the interpretation of prehistoric figurines, ranging from the scepticism of P. J. Ucko at one end of the scale (Anthropomorphic Figurinesfrom Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete, Greece and the Near East, London 1968, chaps. 14-18) to the religiocentric approach of M. Gimbutas at the other (The Gods and Goddesses of Old Europe, 7000 to 2500 B.C.: Myths, Legends and Cult Images, London/Los Angeles 1974, passim).

In this context it is interesting that 38, which has been assigned to the Late Neolithic, appears to be a unique example of a Neolithic animal-carcass figurine;40 if the date is correct, 38 would have been made over a thousand years before the EH II figurines and can hardly be connected with them. This is not the place to speculate on the function of these animal figurines. The gamut of superstitious beliefs and practices, since magic and religion are closely intertwined in primitive societies, is so great that it is difficult to prefer one hypothesis to another. Do they represent real animals that were ritually sacrificed in some religious ceremony to honor or placate a tribal deity, or were they talismans to ensure the fertility of the domestic animals? The opinion expressed by Ucko4 I concerning the Egyptian animal figurines, that they prob- ably had a magical purpose to promote the growth of the flocks and herds, may be echoed here. In the flourishing culture of the Early Helladic Peloponnese, where agriculture, met- allurgy, and trade were expanding as never before, these slaughtered-carcass figurines were surely intended, in some way we shall probably never know, to increase the meat production of the Corinthian farmers. CLAYS, SLIPS, AND PAINTS Since, in the introduction above, unstratified figurines are sometimes attributed to a particular Neolithic or Early Helladic phase on the basis of their fabric and finish, it may be useful to describe them briefly for the reader unfamiliar with Corinthian clays and slips used in those periods. The fabric and finish of the figurines are generally similar to those of the pottery with which, when they come from a stratified context, they are known to be contemporary. The characteristic wares of the Neolithic and Early Helladic periods from Corinth are usually sufficiently distinctive to be readily identifiable by visual inspection, but atypical examples do occur that are difficult to classify when found in a mixed context. The earliest figurines from Corinth belong to the Middle Neolithic period, which is characterized by Urfirnis ware. The fabric is fine, hard, dense, and slightly granular, with a filler of small white grits and sometimes dark inclusions and a little gold mica. The grits are evenly dispersed through the clay. This filler and the granular texture clearly distinguish Urfirnis ware from the typical fabrics of the other periods. The color is predominantly red, ranging from pale pink to deep brick, although buffs and tans are not uncommon. Some pieces have been reduced in the firing to gray and black, and where the reduction process has not penetrated the full thickness of the clay a pink or orange core may be visible. The surface was normally smoothed and lightly burnished. The figurines, unlike the 39 Banks (footnote 18 above), p. 638: type A 1, "sacrificial rams"; chart on p. 624. 40 The lively Neolithic head of a doe from Prodromos has a long, deep gash in the center of the face, proba- bly representing a slaughtered animal: Theochares (footnote 11 above), pl. 101. 4' Ucko (footnote 36 above), pp. 416, 424.</page><page sequence="8">240 W. W. PHELPS pots, seem not to have been coated with slip, although 3 appears to have a thin, transparent overslip. The painted decoration is commonly red brown to dark brown and slightly lus- trous, like the slip and paint on the pottery. It resembles the EH II Urfirnis and the Myce- naean, Geometric, and Classical "glazes" and was the result of a similar technique.42 The relative uniformity of the MN Urfirnis was replaced by a number of different wares, of which the most important for our purpose is the Matt Painted, whose appearance was taken by Weinberg to mark the beginning of the Late Neolithic period.43 The generic term Matt Painted covers a wide range of fabrics and colors, whose only common feature is that the paint used for the decoration is characteristically, but not in- variably, matt. The fabric varies from fine, dense, and almost gritless to coarse with large white, brown, black, and red inclusions; the presence of the latter as a filler is new in this period and characterizes a number of Late and Final Neolithic wares. The body may be hard and clinky, like the best Urfirnis, or soft and friable. The color of the clay may be red, buff, or white, often with a greenish tinge, and there may be a dark core. The surface color some- times differs from that of the body owing to firing, slipping, or burnishing, and the surface may be highly burnished or, more usually, simply smoothed. The paints can be divided into a dark and a red group. The dark group includes black, chocolate brown, and faded mauve, and the paint may be thick and crusty or thin and watery. The red group includes orange red, red brown, cherry red, and vermilion. Occa- sionally the dark and red paints have a low natural luster; lustrous black is very uncommon in the Peloponnese on this ware, but lustrous cherry red and vermilion are found either alone or together with matt black paint on certain late Polychrome wares. Apart from the Matt Painted examples there are a number of more or less coarse, monochrome figurines that could be Late Neolithic, Final Neolithic, or Early Helladic I, since such monochrome pottery is common to all three periods. It is true that certain wares and shapes are characteristic of each period, but some of the figurine fragments are either so worn that the original surface, which might have associated them with a particular ware, has been destroyed or else the fabric and finish are too generalized to be assigned to one phase rather than to another. The LN, FN, and EH I monochrome pottery can be black, dark, red, tan, or mottled, with or without a slip, and the surface may be burnished, smoothed, or slurry finished. The fabric and finish of the EH II animal figurines are relatively uniform. Even though some of the pieces are fragmented and worn and the surface finish has been destroyed, the fabric is sufficiently characteristic to distinguish it from the other fabrics described above. The clay is fine and dense, with a few fine grits; for this reason the gritty fabric of 58 stands out as an exception. The color is predominantly light or medium buff, but pale red or creamy white also occur. 42 M. Farnsworth and I. Simmons, "Coloring Agents for Greek Glazes," AJA 67, 1963, pp. 389-396. 43 S.

Almost half of these figurines are coated overall with red, red- brown, black-brown, or black Urfirnis paint, and the rest have patterns painted directly onto the smooth, unslipped surface. The paint is the same as that used for slipping or deco- rating the EH II pottery and is very similar to the Middle Neolithic Urfirnis described above, from which, however, it can often be distinguished by the crackled appearance of the surface where the paint was applied thickly.

The closest parallel in the Peloponnese is a clay head, no. 992 in the Patras Museum, from Akrata, which is longer and thinner and has painted hair in the Urfirnis technique. The closest parallel in Greece, however, is a head from Karabairam in Thessaly (C. Tsountas, AL Hpow(-To- PtKaL 'AKpo7rdAS ?L/J7OV Kat IEKAov, Athens 1908, fig. 224).

Twelve out of the 13 samples of his group M, to which 59 belongs, came from the sites of Keramidaki (Gymnasium Area) and Korakou, as did two thirds of the samples of his group N, to which 48 and 53 belong. 41 was not attributed to a group. Attas' conclusion is that 59 almost certainly, and 48 and 53 very probably, were made of local clays taken from the Corinthian plain.</page><page sequence="10">242 W. W. PHELPS 3.

A painted line follows the deep, sharp, medial groove in front and behind; remnant of a hand with incisions to mark the fingers on the front of the upper thigh. Painted lines above the hand probably indicate the pubic triangle. The smooth surface of the break is exactly outlined by the groove, and it seems to have been separated after firing, to judge by the light-red color in the center of the break and the finely ragged edges. The inner surface must have been quite flat when the legs were pressed to- gether before firing. Lavezzi, "Corinth," pl. 104:9. Talalay, fig. 6-4, p. 155: Group P. 7.

Incised pubic tri- angle and scar where the hand was attached to the upper thigh, with thin incisions to mark the fingers. The foot is complete and slightly concave. The leg gives the impression of having been separated in a still semiplastic state, because the lower edge of the medial break is slightly raised and the surface of the break shows signs of having been finger smoothed. Besides being unpainted, the leg is also atypical in that the lower part and the foot appear not to have been united to the other half. I have assigned the leg to the MN period solely on the grounds of fabric and technique, which, though not characteristic, look to me more MN than LN. 11. LN Matt Painted figurine leg P1. 34 MF-70-36. Forum West, EH II pit, 1970. P.H. 0.058, max. W. 0.025, max. D. at buttock 0.031 m.

Left female leg, lower abdomen to foot; upper left side flaked off. The painted lines follow the deep me- dial groove and the pubic triangle incision. The foot is complete. The surface of the medial break is smooth but not flat, with slightly raised margins, as though the fragment had been pulled apart from the other half while still in a semiplastic state. Lavezzi, "Corinth," pp. 427, 450-451, pl. 110:7. Talalay, fig. 6-4, p. 155: Group P. This leg came from an EH pit which contained some LN but virtually no MN material; the fabric and paint are typically LN, which may also explain why the upper break is different from the upper breaks on the MN legs. There can be little hesitation in assigning the leg to the LN period. Since the tran- sition from the MN to the LN was not abrupt, and Urfirnis pottery coexisted for some time with Matt Painted pottery during the LN I (Forum West) phase, a half-leg in the Matt Painted technique need not cause a chronological problem. 12.

Complete human head, broken at the neck, which is round in section. The tip of the nose is chipped, and a patch of the hair, which is made of small ap- plied pellets, has flaked off the upper right side. Black matt paint outlines the hairline, back and front; two horizontal lines between the nose and the hairline, barely visible, are probably meant to indi- cate eyes, like the incisions on 1.</page><page sequence="12">244 W. W. PHELPS Weinberg, 1939, pp. 599-600, fig. 12. Talalay, fig. 6-3, p. 139: singleton. Weinberg (1951, p. 129) assigned this head to the MN period. Stylistically it is unique and has no close parallels. In view of its provenance, however, a mixed LN and EH fill in which there was very little MN material, and of its fabric and paint which are typically LN, a LN date is the more probable. 13. LN painted figurine head P1. 35 MF-70-25. Sacred Spring, mixed fill, 1970. P.H. 0.047 m. Dense, coarse, buff-gray clay with coarse grits; the surface, where preserved, is pink buff and smooth with traces of red-brown glossy paint. Clay 5YR 7/1; surface 5YR 7/6. Complete human head with part of the neck, very worn. A shallow groove separates the face from what is probably the hair; a faint incision may mark the mouth, and two small protrusions the eyes, but these features could be accidental surface irregularities. On the back of the neck are traces of a painted zig- zag, and in front of the neck two applied pellets might represent a necklace. The head is bent for- ward at a curious angle to the neck. The condition of this piece is so weathered that little can be said about it. The clay and paint are LN rather than MN.

Standing female figurine preserved from the waist to the feet, which are chipped. The navel is indicated by a hole, and incisions mark the pubic triangle, leg division, and ankles. The black patches apparent in places could be deposit but I think are more probably paint. Robinson and Weinberg, pp. 250-251, pl. 63:e, 1. The fabric is typical of the LN coarse Matt Paint- ed variety. The worn condition of the figurine makes visual identification of the paint uncertain, but if I am not deceived by the apparent indications, it would have been polychrome. In any case the date should be LN. 15. LN figurine P1. 35 MF-1 977-1 11. Temple Hill, mixed context, 1977. P.H. 0.046, max. W. 0.042, max. Th. 0.020 m.

The left arm resting beneath the left breast and part of the right breast are preserved; whether the right arm, now missing, was in a similar position is not certain. On the straight back two deep incised lines, begin- ning at the waist, cross and pass over the shoulders to end in a V between the breasts. No parallels for this figurine are known to me in the Peloponnese. The plasticity of the modeling is reminiscent of Thessalian EN and MN figurines: cf. Zervos, fig. 255. If this piece is not imported, how- ever, the fabric would exclude any but a LN date in Corinth. 16. LN Matt Painted figurine P1. 34 MF-68-285. Temple Hill, mixed fill, 1968. P.H. 0.042, max.

A deep, curving, transverse groove separates the stomach from the prominent abdomen. Vertical, wavy, painted lines down the back and sides below the elbows probably depict long hair. H. S.

The ample proportions of the waist, abdomen, and arms qualify this figurine as a real fat lady, of which there are few clay examples in the Pelopon- nese, unlike Thessaly.

Fat female torso, shoulders to thigh. The breasts are partly preserved; the arms and the hands, which originally rested under the breasts, are missing. Two incised lines on the belly indicate rolls of flesh, and the navel is shown by a hole; on the lower back two depressions indicate buttock dimples. In the incised groove and between the breasts are traces of thick, red paint. The figure, in a standing posture, is well modeled and finished. Weinberg, 1937, p. 522, fig. 41. Talalay, fig. 6-3, p. 147: singleton. Weinberg (1951, p. 128) assigned this figurine to the EN period. The mixed context does not help in dating it, but the fabric is LN rather than MN or EN. The type is well known in Boiotia and Thessaly (cf. Caskey and Caskey, "Eutresis," pl. 52:1.34; Tsountas [under 1], pl. 32, which are EN and MN), but it is too generalized to have chronological sig- nificance. The closest in technique is 18, of slenderer proportions. 18. LN painted figurine P1. 36 MF 8505. Museum West, mixed LN-EH fill, 1939. P.H. 0.070, W. waist 0.030, D. at buttock 0.028, Th. at upper break 0.016 m. Clay similar to 17: dense, grayish core, light tan- buff surface; well burnished, with thin, dark matt paint. 7.5YR 7/4. Female torso, chest to left thigh, broken at the lower margins of the breasts and the right buttock and leg. As with 19 and 20, the breaks probably indi- cate where the component clay cores were joined. The incised lines across the abdomen denote creases of skin, as on 17. On the back of the left thigh are traces of painted, vertical, wavy lines. The angle of the thigh indicates a setting or reclining posture, but there is no clue to the position of the arms except that the hands do not appear to have rested under the breasts or on the thighs. The proportions and model- ing are excellent, and I know of no close parallels. The fabric and paint are LN in appearance, and the Museum West excavations produced little other than LN and EH material, and so a LN date is the most probable. 19.

Fine, dense, pale cream clay; low burnished, cream surface with traces of black paint. 2.5YR 7/4. Left half of a torso, chest to thigh, broken vertical- ly down the medial line. There are no obvious breasts, unless the gentle swelling of the upper part of the torso is intended to indicate them, but the sex is probably female, to judge from the general propor- tions. The stomach and thigh are full but not exag- gerated; the projection of the buttock may be put down to the sitting posture. The back is slightly con- cave. On the worn surface are traces of black paint but too few to reveal a pattern. The medial break is rough and jagged, in contrast to that on the MN legs, and probably indicates the use of separate cores to build up the figurine. The fabric is typical of the Co- rinthian LN. See 17 for comments. 20. LN figurine P1. 36 MF 8506. Museum West, mixed LN-EH fill, 1939. P.H. 0.068, p.W. 0.020 m. Soft, pale gray clay with dark grits and pitting; pale gray-buff worn surface. 10YR 7/2. Left torso and leg, broken vertically down the me- dial line. The chest and abdomen, which had two belly grooves like 17, have also broken away, show- ing clearly the core junctions. There are no visible signs of paint on the worn surface. The figurine is standing; there are no positive indications of sex, but it is assumed to be female because of the proportions. Weinberg (1951, p. 129) suggested that it has much in common with 17; it also has something in common with 13 and 19. The LN date is based on the provenance and fabric; see 12. 21.

Lower torso and crossed legs of a sitting female figurine, broken above the protruding abdomen; part of the right breast is preserved. The spreading but- tocks are separated by a groove, and two grooves on either side of the waist may denote rolls of flesh. The figurine appears to have been constructed from sev- eral cores.

Talalay, fig. 6-4, p. 154: Group N. Weinberg (1951, pp. 121-133) discussed at some length a number of sitting, cross-legged female figu- rines from Greece and the Aegean and concluded that they should be dated to the MN period; C. Ren- frew agreed ("The Development and Chronology of Cycladic Figurines," AJA 73, 1969 [pp. 1-32], p. 29). More recently, however, Weinberg has sug- gested that the "production of such figurines . .. con- tinued well into the Late Neolithic period, if not through it . . ." ("Anthropomorphic Stone Figurines from Neolithic Greece," in Art and Culture of the Cyclades, J. Thimme, ed., Karlsruhe 1977 [pp. 52- 58], p. 52). In fact, the provenance of most of the figurines is unknown; see Tsountas (under 1), p. 385, note 50 for the five Sparta figurines; A. J. B. Wace, "Prehistoric Stone Figurines from the Mainland," Hesperia, Suppl. VIII, Commemorative Studies in Honor of T. Leslie Shear, [Princeton] 1949 (pp. 423-426), p. 425, for the Sparta, Aigina, and two Amorgos figu- rines; J. D. Evans and C. Renfrew, Excavations at Saliagos near Antiparos, BSA Suppl. Vol. 5, [Lon- don] 1968, p. 86, for general comment. In every case where the provenance is secure, the date is LN (e.g. Saliagos, ibid., fig. 75, pl. XLII), and Corinth 21 from the fabric and context must surely be LN; see comment above under 12. Nevertheless, even if the island provenance attrib- uted to some of the figurines be accepted, it is neces- sary to explain why on the islands cited, except for Saliagos and Crete, either no Neolithic material has been found or, at most, only a little Final Neolithic. This is not to say that none of the cross-legged figu- rines are MN, but simply that there is no evidence pointing to a MN rather than a LN date for any of them. The posture must have been as common in Neolithic times as it is today in many part of the world, and the assumption that this posture is unique enough in itself to constitute a chronological- ly closed series seems to me difficult to justify. 22.

A broken chevron band in black paint runs across the front; the back is very worn. No features indicating the sex are preserved, and there is no evidence for the type of body or legs; the latter could have been crossed, like 21, or straight, like the Matt Painted figurine from Franchthi (Jacobsen, 1973, pl. 52:b, c). Robinson and Weinberg, p. 251, pl. 63:e, 2. The LN pit in Trench IV, from which 22 came, consisted chiefly of LN material with very little MN Urfirnis and some EH II Urfirnis and coarse ware; the context, fabric, and paint set this figurine firmly in the LN period. 23.

Three vertical lines are painted down the side and three across the upper thigh, which continue underneath the buttock. The central break is very like that on 19, and the fabric is similar; the core is visible in the section, covered with a clay coating ca. 0.002 m. thick.

The back shows some modeling. Robinson and Weinberg, p. 251, pl. 63:e, 3. Weinberg comments that the fabric appears to be foreign to Corinth; indeed, both the clay and what little can be discerned of the torso are quite unlike anything else at Corinth. Earlier than LN it cannot be, because of the fabric and context, and a date later than FN is unlikely because, although some EH II was present in the deposit, EH II human figurines are very rare and more or less schematic in form (cf. C. W. Blegen, Zygouries, Cambridge, Mass. 1928, pl. XXI:1; J. L. Caskey, "Excavations at Lerna, 1954," Hesperia 24, 1955 [pp. 25-49], pl. 22:j, k). 25. LN figurine foot P1. 36 MF 8507.

Lower leg and slightly concave, chipped foot, which may originally have had a heel and toes. One side, probably the medial, has been left unburnished. The core and outer layer of clay are visible. It is as- signed to the LN period because of its context and fabric. Solitary legs of this sort have turned up in LN and FN contexts at Alepotrypa and Franchthi, and it is not always clear whether they are from very large figurines or vases; in this case the unburnished side suggests that it was one of a pair, close together but not joined. It is different from the Nemea EN legs cited earlier (footnote 7 above). 26. LN Matt Painted figurine P1. 38 MF 13360. Agora SW, mixed context, 1934. P.H. 0.085, W. of buttocks 0.027 m.

Torso and legs of a female figurine, broken at the neck, all the front of the body broken away below the breasts, which are partly preserved. Both shoulders and the broken stumps of the arms are preserved. The left hand rested under the left breast, but the right one may have hung down. The feet below the painted ankle bands are broken. Two horizontal bands are painted on the back and sides above the buttocks; from the lower band depend vertical lines extending halfway down the legs. This decoration probably represents a belt and skirt (cf. Jacobsen, 1973, pl. 52:b, c). In the broken front a wide V- shaped groove has been deeply cut with a sharp tool, and the sides of the figurine splay outwards at the edge of the break. It is hard to imagine the purpose of the tooled groove, but the figurine was clearly at- tached to some object, perhaps the wall of the vase, as they sometimes were in Thessaly (see K. Grund- mann, "Figuirliche Darstellungen in der neolitischen Keramik Nord- und Mittelgriechenlands," JdI 68, 1953, pp. 1-37). Another instance of the LN potters' taste for unusual objects is the "Lady of Corinth" published by Walker Kosmopoulos (p. 50, pl. IV:a), which was apparently the upper part of an anthro- pomorphic vase. The fabric and paint are LN. 27. LN patterned base P1. 37 MF 6742. Temple Hill, Neolithic fill, 1937. P.H. 0.052, oval top 0.055 x 0.037, oval bottom 0.057 x 0.040 m. Pinkish core, light-buff clay with many inclusions of red pellets, some up to 0.0025 m.; burnished surface with glossy red paint. 7.5YR 8/4. A base, oval in plan, expanding slightly at the bot- tom, and broken at the top along a deep wide groove. It is decorated all around with a meandroid pattern, much worn. Weinberg, 1937, p. 522, fig. 43. It is impossible to tell to what this base belonged; it may have been to a pot or utensil or even to some kind of figurine. Weinberg suggested that the tech- nique was that of the EN painted ware, but the fab- ric, with the red pellet inclusions, is characteristic of the LN period, and the glossy red paint, the result of over-all burnishing, is typical of a small class of</page><page sequence="16">248 W. W. PHELPS pottery associated with the polychrome wares of the late LN and commoner at Gonia than at Corinth (cf. Phelps, p. 251). The pattern also, although I know of no exact parallel, would be more at home in a late LN context. 28. LN/FN/EH figurine head P1. 37 MF 1942. South of Temple E, intrusive prehis- toric fill, 1932. P.H. 0.051, max. W. 0.052, Th. below nose 0.023 m. Light-gray core, dense, orange clay; smooth sur- face. 2.5YR 6/8. Human head, broken at the neck, which is circu- lar in section. The lower part of the nose, which has two holes for nostrils, is broken; the ears, each of which has three holes, are chipped. The eyes and mouth are indicated by holes and the eyebrows by light grooves. The abnormal projection of the chin may be meant to denote a beard. The unusually de- tailed rendering of the facial features contrasts with the flatness of the head and the huge perforated ears. Walker Kosmopoulos, pp. 31, 54, fig. 8:a, b. I know of no close parallels. The use of holes for the eyes and mouth in a similar manner is not infre- quent in Thessaly (e.g. Zervos, figs. 191-193), and perforations are a feature of figurines in eastern Macedonia and Thrace, but none of them appear to be relevant to 28. The fabric is not EN or MN. The pottery of the intrusive fill from which the head came was chiefly EH II and perhaps, from the author's description, EH I; only 7% was Neolithic, and that was LN in date (Walker Kosmopoulos, p. 58). Since neither typology nor technique serve in choosing between LN, FN, EH I, and EH II, it is idle to speculate on the date of this grotesque head. The statistical odds are heavily against LN; on the other hand, the few known FN figurines are schematic, no figurines have to my knowledge so far been attributed to EH I, and the rare EH II human, as opposed to animal, fig- urines are also schematic. 29. LN figurine P1. 38 MF 8543. Museum West, mixed LN-EH fill, 1939. P.H. 0.080, p.L. 0.043 m. Yellow-cream clay with fine grits; smooth surface. 7.5YR 7/4. Torso and upper right thigh of a female figurine; broken at the neck, arms, and legs. The back is rounded and the waist circular; there are two small pellet breasts. The object attached to the waist was presumably held by the left arm and may have been a child. Weinberg, 1939, p. 600, fig. 13. Talalay, fig. 6-3, p. 144: Group I. Weinberg suggested that this was a male figurine wearing a triangular dagger, but the breasts and shapelessness of the object seem to me to make this unlikely. The context only allows the probability of a LN or an EH date; for the reasons given under 24 above, the former is preferable. 30. LN/FN figurine P1. 39 MF-75-85. Temple Hill, mixed context, 1975. P.H. 0.071, Th. 0.022 m. Fine, dense, orange-brick clay; finger smoothed surface. 5YR 7/6. Upper torso of a female figurine, broken at the neck (which has a rectangular section), at the arms, and at the oval waist. The pellet breasts have flaked off. Both front and back are quite flat and are paral- lel, except for a slight thickening towards the waist. The context and fabric are of no help in dating this figurine. There is nothing like it among the handful of published EH figurines, but the flat, schematic body does have rough parallels in FN con- texts (Jacobsen, 1969, pl. 99:b, 1; Jacobsen, 1973, pl. 53, from Franchthi; N. Lambert, La grotte pre- historique de Kitsos (Attique) I, Paris 1981, p. 395, fig. 254, from Kitsos Cave). Because of the fine fab- ric, an EH date cannot be excluded, but on typologi- cal grounds a FN date would be more satisfactory. 31. Marble figurine P1. 38 T 40 (Sc 3). Theater, mixed fill, 1925. P.H. 0.037, W. shoulders 0.033, W. hips 0.032, max. Th. 0.015 m. White, fine-grained stone, probably marble; very smooth surface with a warm patina. Torso and thighs of a female figurine, complete except for the head. The breasts and the arms meet- ing under them are very lightly modeled, and shal- low incisions mark the waist, thighs, and vulva. The underside of the thighs is not horizontal but beveled at a low angle; the back and front are flat except for a slight narrowing at the waist.</page><page sequence="17">PREHISTORIC FIGURINES FROM CORINTH 249 The closest parallel known to me is the stylisti- cally very similar figurine of unknown provenance published by Thimme ("Neolithic Idols from Greece," in Art and Culture of the Cyclades [under 21] [pp. 415-425], pp. 216, 422, no. 16). For the treatment of the upper torso, cf. ibid., p. 215, no. 14; Phelps, fig. 102:2, Alepotrypa. For the lower torso and legs, cf. Zervos, fig. 139, "Sparta"; Thimme, op. cit., p. 213, no. 10, "Aigina"; and a figurine in the Brummer Collection: J. Coolidge, Ancient Art in American Private Collections (Fogg Art Museum exhibition catalogue), Cambridge, Mass. 1954, pl. 34, no. 125, "Cyclades". For comments on these figurines and their alleged provenances, see 21 above. Of the figurines just cited, the only one with a secure provenance is that from Alepotrypa, where virtually all the material is LN and FN. The looseness, however, of the typological parallels and the lack of positive evidence for the chronology of most of them make the dating of this figurine a matter of speculation; my preference is for a LN/FN date. 32. Marble figurine P1. 39 S 786. One meter southwest of Martyr VI, 1907. P.H. 0.12 1, max. W. 0.055, Th. buttocks 0.038 m. White stone similar to 31, probably marble (al- though Johnson [see below] did not think so); pol- ished surface with patches of incrustation all over, including the broken surfaces and especially on the back. Torso and complete left leg of a female figurine; the head, left shoulder and arm, and the right leg are missing. The right arm and presumably also the left were short, round stubs. The modeling is full and careful. An incised line separates the breast from the stomach; other incised lines mark the buttock cleav- age, pubic triangle, and creases on the thigh; deeper grooves appear to indicate the knee and ankle joints. F. P. Johnson, Corinth, IX, Sculpture 1896- 1923, Cambridge, Mass. 1931, pp. 1-2, fig. 1. Talalay, fig. 6-3, p. 146: singleton. Like 31, this figurine is unique. Perhaps the clos- est parallel, except for the arms, is the Alepotrypa figurine cited under 31; and, in fact, similar arm stubs occur on another, more schematic figurine from the same site (Phelps, fig. 102:1). Such similar- ities, however, are not enough to date this figurine, although they show that the same techniques and traits were current in the FN or LN periods, to which the Alepotrypa examples belong. My own suggestion is that the figurine is unlikely to have been carved before the LN period. 33. Stone figurine P1. 39 MF 6741. Temple Hill, mixed fill, 1937. P.H. 0.065, Th. 0.031 m. Rough limestone; original unworked surface. The figurine appears to be a natural calcareous concretion or field stone, broken at one end, with, at the other, a forked projection slightly suggestive of a pair of legs. At some period it was roughly chipped to produce a groove in the area of the crotch and a longer groove at the back to indicate buttocks. The result is a very crude representation of the lower part of a human figure. There is no clue to its date. 34. LN/EH animal head P1. 40 MF 8545. Museum West, mixed LN-EH fill, 1939. P.L. neck to brow 0.040, max. L. poll to tip of jaw 0.035 m. Coarse, dark gray core, dark red outside with a black patch on the neck; full of big, perhaps quartz, grits; smooth, slurry surface. 2.5YR 6/6. Head and part of the neck; right ear and snout broken. The ear is short and upright; the complete lower jaw is broad, short, and rounded; the mouth is open. The general shape of the head and neck and the absence of horns make it unlikely to be a rumi- nant. The other possible candidates are bears, carni- vores, and pigs. Because of the ears and the lower jaw profile I prefer the last, with bear as second choice. The context makes either a LN/FN or an EH date possible. The fabric and finish are not helpful, because rather rough, small animal figurines are not uncommon in EH contexts; cf. K. Muller, Tiryns, IV, Die Urfirniskeramik, Munich 1938, pls. V:7, XXV:9, which is the closest parallel, and Holmberg, Asea, fig. 111:12 for the open imouth. It is classed by Talalay (Table 6-5) as FN; there is a similar but more canine FN head from Franchthi (Talalay, fig. 102 B).</page><page sequence="18">250 W. W. PHELPS 35. LN animal head P1. 40 MF 9915. Lechaion Road East, LN context, 1959. P.H. 0.040, oval neck 0.025 x 0.015 m. Fine, dense, light-gray clay with coarse grits; smooth surface with traces of what looks like black paint but which could be deposit. lOYR 6/1. Head broken at the neck and left ear. Perforations below the projecting ears may represent eyes or ear holes; in the center of the face is a short conical pro- tuberance. The back of the head is flat, and the neck is thicker from front to back than the head. I know of no parallels for this curious piece, which seems nei- ther human nor like any specific animal, even allow- ing for schematization. It rather suggests an owl of the eagle or long-eared species. The date, however, is almost certainly LN, to judge from the context pottery with which it was found, which is all LN except for a handful of EH sherds. 36. LN/FN animal head P1. 40 MF 13144. New Museum East, mixed context, 1940. P.L. 0.038, max. H. 0.020, Th. 0.015 m. Hard, coarse, dark red clay, gritty like 24; dark red, finger-smoothed surface. lOR 4/8. Head and neck merging into the left foreleg are preserved, broken at the shoulder; mouth and right eye indicated; very compressed laterally forward of the eye. No parallels are known to me, but the head would be quite a realistic representation of the head of a tortoise. The only clues to its date are the fabric, which could not be earlier than LN, and the subject and style, which seem to me more LN than EH. Classed by Talalay (Table 6-5) as FN. 37. LN animal figurine P1. 40 MF-1977-112. Temple Hill, mixed context, 1977. Max. L. 0.063, central section 0.015 x 0.013 m. Fine, dense, gray core, buff outside, with small dark and micaceous grits; well-burnished surface with red-brown matt paint. 7.5YR 7/4. Curved, tapering shaft of subcircular section, broken at both ends, with two projecting tines. Two carelessly painted bands circle the shaft, and broader lines outline the tines; there is a small, neatly made perforation at the base of the smaller tine. This curi- ous object is well made and finished; its distinctive form suggests part of an antler, left side, of either a red or a roe deer. The fabric and paint are characteristic of LN Matt Painted ware. 38. LN Matt Painted animal P1. 40 MF-68-103. Sacred Spring Area, mixed fill, 1968. P.L. 0.072, Th. 0.036 m. Pale red core shading to buff outside, with black and brown grits; smooth, greenish cream slurry with brown matt paint. 5Y 8/1 1. The rear half of the trunk, broken behind the thorax. The stump of the right leg is preserved, the left one is missing; the short triangular, rounded tail is complete. The back and sides are painted with zig- zag lines. Some sort of protuberance has flaked off the right haunch. A deep V-shaped groove in the belly runs from the break to a point just forward of the hind legs. The only animal with hindquarters and a tail like these is a sheep, and the belly cut must represent a slaughtered carcass (see pp. 238-239 above for comment). The fabric and finish are unmistakably LN Matt Painted. 39. LN/EH animal figurine P1. 40 MF 3269. New Museum, mixed context, 1931. P.L. 0.055, p.H. 0.025 m. Fine, orange-buff clay with white and dark grits; burnished, buff surface with thin, dark matt paint. 5YR 6/6. Trunk and head, with part of the upturned tail and hind legs preserved; the muzzle, horns, and front legs are missing. The head and body are painted with broad transverse bands. The tail, body, and head angle are characteristic of a goat. The fabric, paint, and subject of this tiny figurine virtually restrict its date to a choice between LN and EH. In favor of the former are the fabric, paint, style, and small size; they differ from the typical EH II animal figurines catalogued below. In favor of an EH date are the subject, a domestic animal, which is commoner in Corinthian EH than LN, and perhaps the fact that six other figurines from the New Museum excavations are certainly EH II. The choice is an open one but just marginally weighted in favor of LN, to my mind.</page><page sequence="19">PREHISTORIC FIGURINES FROM CORINTH 251 40. LN/EH animal figurine P1. 40 MF 13145. New Museum, mixed context, 1931. P.L. 0.095, max. W. 0.063, max. H. 0.026 m. Pink clay with white and other grits; cream slip with traces of red paint. 10YR 8/3. Probably part of a trunk, round on top and slight- ly concave laterally underneath, very compressed dorso-ventrally. In plan the trunk tapers from the wider end to a distinct waist and begins to widen again at the other end; underneath at the wider and slightly thicker end the root of a limb(?) is visible at one side, its angle to the horizontal plane of the body being very open. On the flanks are traces of oblique painted stripes. This strange object is a puzzler, and I have no suggestions to offer. The date is also problematical. The context is the same as that of 39 and six of the EH II animal figu- rines. The fabric and slip would fit slightly better, I think, into a LN Matt Painted context but would not occasion great surprise in an EH II one. 41. EH II animal figurine P1. 41 MF 2270. New Museum, mixed context, 1931. P.L. 0.171, p.H. 0.107 m. Light-buff clay; smooth, rosy buff surface with red-brown Urfirnis paint. 7.5YR 8/4. The figurine is complete except for the face, horn tips, and downturned tail; restored from six frag- ments. The back, sides, head, and horns are painted with vertical stripes. The eyes are shown by incised and painted applied pellets. The large horns curve down and forwards and perhaps formed a spiral. A deep, sharp belly cut runs from the fore- to the hind legs, and there is a deep slash on either side of and under the throat. It represents a slaughtered ram carcass (see pp. 238-239 above for comment). Walker Kosmopoulos, p. 60, figs. 42, 43. The EH II context is not in doubt: J. C. Lavezzi, "Early Helladic Hearth Rims at Corinth," Hesperia 48, 1979 (pp. 342-347), p. 346, note 12. For the analysis by Attas, see footnote 44 above. 42. EH II animal figurine P1. 41 MF 2271.

Body and head preserved; legs, head, muzzle, and tip of tail broken. The preserved right eye is indi- cated by a small cut in the clay in front of the horns, which appear from their curve to have resembled those of 41 and are offset from the poll by a slight groove. There is a long gash under the throat, and a deep, wide V-shaped groove in the belly. The back, sides, and head are painted like 41, to which it is almost identical. EH II ram carcass. 43. EH II animal figurine P1. 42 MF 2269. New Museum, EH pit 42a, 1931. P.L. 0.070, diam. belly 0.031 m. Light-buff clay; smooth, rosy buff surface with black-brown Urfirnis paint. 7.5YR 8/4.

Light-buff clay; smooth, rosy buff surface with black-brown Urfirnis paint. 7.5YR 8/4. Neck and part of head preserved; the horns and the face, which is round in section, are broken. The angle of the head, the set of the horns, and the mas- sive, sculptured poll and brow strongly suggest a bull (cf. the Bos primigenius horncore from Neolithic Anza in M. Gimbutas, Neolithic Macedonia as Re- flected by Excavation at Anza, SE Yugoslavia, Los Angeles 1976, fig. 234). 45. EH II animal figurine P1. 42 MF 2300. New Museum, EH pit 42a, 1931. P.L. 0.063 m.

Body, forequarters, and head preserved; forelegs and face broken. The solid body is subcylindrical with a ridge between the legs and no groove. The very worn horns were modeled separately from the head and suggest a ram rather than a bovid. The EH II context of 46 is not so secure as that of the preceding examples, but the fabric and traces of paint look more EH II than anything else. 47. EH II animal figurine P1. 40 MF 12232.

From the worn surface it is hard to tell whether the paint was over-all or in stripes. The appearance of the rather schematized head strongly suggests a bovid. 48.

Morphologically there is no clue to the species, but the spots, if they are not simply deco- ration, could indicate a bovid, because dappling is, I believe, characteristic of certain breeds of cattle; cer- tainly spots are clearly visible on the calves and the bull illustrated on the Ayia Triada sarcophagus (S. Marinatos and M. Hirmer, Crete and Mycenae, London 1960, pls.
