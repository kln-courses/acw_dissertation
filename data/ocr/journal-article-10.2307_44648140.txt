The high penetra- tion resistant laminated windshield, available on the market for about 10 years, provided a ma- jor improvement, avoiding most of the cases of head penetration through the windshield in case of collision in the field, and being able to properly absorb the kinetic energy of head imp- act to avoid severe injury to brain and cervical spine . But the numerous glass fractures which devel- op during the impact unavoidably cause facial laceration and may cause eye injury. On the oth- er hand, the actual effectiveness of the res- strain systems has its own limits in the field. Consequently, a new generation of windshields, which would keep or improve penetration resist- ance and proper energy absorption of the "conven- tional laminate, and which, in addition, would preserve the occupant against facial injury in case of head impact during a collision, would bring a major improvement to safety, in the field. As soon as a plastic material was involved as inner layer in the proposed new windshield, the - ABSTRACT The four-layer laminated Securiflex wind- shield has been tested in simulated collisions at the Wayne State University up to 40 mph Barrier Equivalent Velocities, to demonstrate that it causes no laceration. has been exposed to usual and extreme envi- ronmental conditions to demonstrate its service- ability in field use. The new windshield consists of a conventional laminated construction (glass/high penetration resistant interlayer/glass) combined with a 0.5 mm innerlayer of plastic. Glass is used on the outer surface of the windshield to withstand the abrasion and scratching of sand, windshield wipers and cleaning. The laminated construction prevents penetration and provides a pocket or cushion action to decelerate the head without injury. The innerlayer is made of a special plastic film which protects the face of the occupants against laceration and eye injury during head impact. It also prevents glass par- ticles and splinters from flying inside the vehicle from external impacts of stones and other objects. The inner plastic film is abrasion and scratch resistant. Extended installation in vehicles has shown that it is not damaged through normal use. The Securiflex construction has been ex- posed to high and low temperature and humidity, chemicals, food, cosmetics, cigarette, smoke, etc.: it is not adversely affected by these agents and has performed perfectly well in long term service tests. 1101 0096-736X/78/8602-1 101 $02.50 Copyright © 1978 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">1 102 O. JANDELEIT AND R. O RAIN major problem (after to demonstrate its high safety performance) was to thoroughly evaluate the ability of the new plastic material to withstand all usual actions of environmental conditions the interior of a windshield is sub- jected to, as also the eventual problems for handling and mounting. Accordingly, the follow- ing matters are successively considered in the paper : 1 . Basic properties of the new windshield: optical properties, performance in case of col- lision, performance in case of flying object impact to the exterior. 2. Performance of the new plastic as inner- layer: abrasion, ageing, cleaning, chemicals, static electricity, flammability. . . 3. Handling and mounting or other problems at the car manufacturer^ facilities. BASIC PROPERTIES OF THE NEW WINDSHIELD OPTICAL PROPERTIES - Even if noteworthy for its performance in case of accident, it is an evidence that a new windshield has, first, to ensure as high visibility as the standard wind- shield in normal use. The optical properties are measured according to ASA specifications for windshields, i.e. lu- minous transmittance , optical deviation and vis- ibility distorsion, light stability. Luminous Transmittance - The luminous transmittance of Securiflex is very close to the luminous transmittance of its conventional lami- nated basis, as shown in Table 1 and on Fig. 1 and 2. Optical Deviation and Visibility Distortion - The Securiflex windshield passes both the opti- cal deviation and the visibility distortion tests of UASA Test No. 15 Z-26.1 - 1966 Light Stability - After I5OO h exposure to the radiation of a 2500 Watts XBF-2500 W/1 Xenon lamp, no noticeable discoloration develops in the irradiated specimens, no noticeable change of luminous transmittance is measured (see de- tails in Appendix No 1 ) . Light Reflectance - It has been measured that the reflectance of light striking the. plas- tic side of the new glazing at 45° is 5 to 10 /0 lower than measured on the glass side. This property could help to reduce the reflected image of the instrument panel on the windshield. HEAD IMPACT (l)*- The performance of a wind- shield in case of head impact is measured by means of 3 main criteria: Resistance to Penetra- tion, Potential Brain Injury, Laceration. Securiflex has been compared with convention- al laminate. The results reported below concern *USAS Z-26.1 - 1966 ANSI, 1430 Broadway N.Y. N.Y. 10018 **Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper the program completed at the Wayne State University, they fit in well with other pro- grams completed in other laboratories. The ob- jectives were achieved by simulated collisions at velocities ranging from 20 to 65 km/h with the windshields installed in a 1975 Peugeot 504 automobile. A Part 572 anthropomorphic dummy was seated in the right front passenger position to simulate the occupant in the collision. Resistance to Penetration - It is evaluated by measuring the velocity at which penetration occurs. It is considered that penetration occurs as soon as some interlayer tears occur, because it was observed that there is a substantial in- crease of laceration severity (about 2 TLI units) as soon as interlayer tears occur in the standard windshield. The threshold of penetra- tion for the standard windshield was around 35 km/h, that means that above this velocity a majority of experiments resulted in substantial interlayer tears. Only one Securiflex windshield had interlayer tears, of 50 and. 75 nim, at the 57 km/h velocity. There were one Securiflex run at 62 km/h and one at 65 km/h with no tears in the interlayer. Potential Brain Injury - It is measured by calculating the Head Injury Criterion HIC (2) as a function of Barrier Equivalent Impact Velocity. The HIC from the best fit curve for the Securiflex windshield data is approximately 100 units higher than the best fit curve for the standard windshield. The theoretical maximum allowable HIC of 1000 is reached at about 48 km/h with the Securiflex and 51 km/h for the standard windshield, which is considered as a no significant difference, because of the low cor- relation coefficients and the usual scatter in windshield performance data. Fig. 3 graphically shows HIC versus B.E.V. for the simulated colli- sions with Securiflex and standard windshields, as well as the second order best fit curves. Laceration - The laceration severity is eval- uated by calculating the Triplex Laceration Index TLI (3) as a function of B.E.V.- There were no lacerations at BEV up to 65km/h for the Securiflex windshield. Laceration occured at all velocities above 20-25 km/h for the standard windshield: the laceration index was TLI 5 at 25 km/h and TLI 8 at 60 km/h. TLI as a function of BEV is shown on Fig. 4 on which are also reported the penetration data (interlayer tears) FLYING OBJECT IMPACT - The performance of the Securiflex windshield has been compared with the standard windshield behaviour. When a hard fly- ing object hits the exterior of a standard wind- shield, there is a projection of small and sharp glass particles and splinters inside the com- partment and possibly to the eyes of the occu- pants. Fig. 5 illustrates the development of such projection of particles. Above a threshold of impact velocity, the penetration of the ob- ject into the compartment occurs, and there is a risk of severe injury to the occupants. Accordingly, two criteria have been measured in</page><page sequence="3">NON-LACERATIVE WINDSHIELD 1 1 03 Table 1 - Light Transmit tance Transmittance Transmittance Y .

The flying object was simulated with a steels ball to eliminate, in experimental results, spread due to the irregular shape of an object like a stone. The steel-ball was thrown by a compressed-air cannon to the car windshield which was installed in a frame, with respect to its angle in the car. Particles and splinters were gathered on an adhesive paper laid on a wood sheet. All the tests were achieved at room temperature ranging from 15 to 25 °C. The results are presented in Table 2. They show: 1 . a threshold of penetration 25 $ higher with the Securiflex than with the standard wind- shield. 2. no particles and splinters flying inside the compartment up to the penetration with Securiflex. PERFORMANCE OF THE PLASTIC MATERIAL AS INNER- LAYER As soon as a highly transparent material was considered as innerlayer of a windshield to pro- vide a major improvement to its safety perfor- mance, the first questions related to what about abrasion and ageing performance.

IN-CAR-USE OPERATION - Several series of cars equipped with Securiflex windshields of the present construction have been running for three years, with no specific instructions to the drivers. Up to now, the field of experience ex- tends from Polar Circle to south of Italy and Spain. During about the first two years of the in- car-use operation, the windshields were examined about every three months. Afterwards it was decided to wait for eventual complaints from the drivers. However, from time to time (for example when a car will be sold) , a windshield is remov- ed from one car and sent back to the laboratory for thorough checking.</page><page sequence="5">NON-LACERATIVE WINDSHIELD 1105 10| - 1 ~ SECURIFLEX STANDARD T ^ od o d no fracture t hJ ■ d md fracture . „ ¿ Q û - ■ P • ¥ fracture &amp; interlayer tear - 0 û - K ^ ' r leaf*-- - - z li I i /^&gt;r^ ^ ' r leaf*-- % z 2 1 ? s ? /L-^rł À dcss^^"^ Se- ü ¿ - * iL S ' lļ§ fc ïfe ¡£ 2- ' i U v 0_|0_¿.^.- .1 imIM - lk&lt; - - *^'~7m 60 km/hr v 20 30 ¿0 50 60 km/hr VELOCITY Fig. 4 - TLI versus BEV, Wayne State University program, 1975 Fig. 5 - 227 g steel ball impact to the external surface of a conventional laminated windshield, below penetration velocity Table 2 - Flying Object Impact to the Outer Surface of a Car Windshield Steel Ball Parameters Weight (gms) Conventional Securiflex Mean Penetration 68 140 185 Velocity (kilometer/hour) 132 120 150 227 105 135 Mean Weight of N° splin- Splinters inside 227 10 to 20 ters up to the compartment penetration (gms)</page><page sequence="6">1 106 O. JANDELEIT AND R. O RAIN There have been no complaints during the three years the Securiflex windshields of the present construction have been installed in cars in normal use plus the more severe than normal use that auto manufacturer's fleet car experi- ence . Moreover, occasional visual inspection shows that cleaning of the interior does not require any special care in normal use: as a matter of fact, there is no significant scratching or oth- er defects due to cleaning or other action on the inner side of the windshield, even when scratching of the outside is severe after 30 to 50 thousand kilometers. In addition, uniform performance of Securiflex windshields is confirmed by thorough checking some windshields after ari extended run- ning period: no visible or measurable change can be detected with respect to initial data: visi- bility distortions, bubbles, delaminations , lumi- nous transmittance , haze, as well as for adhe- sion of Securiflex plastic layer to glass, abrasion and scratching resistance of it. ABRASION AND SCRATCHING - When both surfaces of the windshield are glass, there is no need to differentiate between the tests for evaluation of the inside and outside surfaces. However, the gross difference between exposure to the inner and outer windshield surfaces is obvious. Conse- quently no correct evaluation of new materials for inside use can be established from existing standard mechanical tests for windshield. According to the fact that cleaning is the main action to the interior of a windshield, a basic study was completed to simulate the mechanical action of cleaning it, to subject to such action the Securiflex construction for a period which would represent several times the actual amount of mechanical action of cleaning for the life of the car. Details of the equip- ment and results with Securiflex are reported in Appendix No 2. The results of this study were transposed to laboratory tests for easier evaluation as also to take into account inadvertent scratching which could occur from the occupants, mostly during cleaning. For cleaning action, the Taber Abraser apparatus with felt wheel (which is one of the standard wheels of the Taber range) was considered as most convenient and representative. Scratching action was simulated by the action of a diamond needle with a controlled load on the tested material. Taber Abraser Tests - 20 000 revolutions are completed on each sample, with a 500 grams load on the dry felt wheel, which represents a very high cleaning pressure. As shown in Fig. 6, there is no significant change of transparency on the Securiflex specimen after cleaning with a solution of 0.5 i detergent in water, which is a usual mean to clean a windshield. The plastic side of the Securiflex glazing was also tested according to the ASA Test No 17» abrasion test for plastics. Results are reported in Fig. 7, they show that the plastic side of Securiflex complies with the requirements of this test (2.5 to 4-5 Ì of haze increase for 15 i maximum allowed haze increase). But we can- not conclude anything significant from this result, because the kind of mechanical action of the CS 10 F wheel used in this test is quite different from cleaning action on the interior of a windshield. The plastic side of Securiflex does not pass the ASA Test No 18 for windshields, which is representative of the hard abrasion action to the exterior of a windshield. But the procedure of Test No 18 does not specify what surface of the windshield has to be submitted to the test (*) Scratching test - It is performed with the apparatus described in Appendix No 3* The plas- tic innerlayer of Securiflex has a specific behaviour in case of scratching: up to a maximum load on the needle, which represents the scratch resistance of the specimens, the trace made by the loaded needle self-heals in a short time. This is due to the partial elasticity of the material. Above this maximum load, the material is scratched by the needle, without self-healing. The scratch resistance of the Securiflex plastic material, measured in grams and according to this method, ranges from 25 to 35 gms. Un-coated plastic materials like acrylate or polycarbonate have a scratch resistance below 3 to 5 gnis. The best hard coatings up to now have a scratch resistance below 15 gms. Submitted to the same test, glass presents a scratch resist- ance of 18-20 gms. Just above this limit, scratches are very thin and not easily seen. But a series of such scratches close together are easily visible and contribute to increasing haze . AGEING - In the same manner as for abrasion, the ageing evaluation of the Securiflex construc- tion was undertaken in two ways: exposure to typical climates (which is continuing) and labo- ratory tests. Exposure to typical climates - Such evaluation is essential to know the actual performance of a new glazing in extreme natural conditions, to be able to settle and perform further adequate and representative laboratory ageing tests. Such climatic exposure operations have been running for several years with Securiflex, chiefly in three typical locations: 1. sea-side climate, mediterraneen sea-shore, with high ultra-violet radiation and high corrosive atmosphere (close to salt-pans). 2. high altitude (5900 ft) in French Alp 3. tropical climate in French Guiana, with high relative humidity and temperature all year long.

About twice a year, small ref- erence specimens are brought back to the labo- ratory for a thorough checking including lumi- nous transmittance , haze, adhesion, self-healing measurements. After two years of uninterrupted exposure some full size specimens were sent back to the laboratory to be submitted to the same checking program and finally to impact tests. After three and half years of uninterrupted ex- posure, no noticeable change can be observed on the specimens of the three locations with re- spect to the initial situation, in particular no delamination, no haze, no bubbles or other de- fects. Ageing simulation in laboratory - The purpose of the tests is to simulate the action of high temperatures, high level of moisture in the at- mosphere, change of temperature, combined ac- tion of heat, humidity and light (weathering). High temperature - The ASA Test for wind- shield evaluation is the Boil Test (ASA Test No 4)&gt; in which specimens are kept in boiling water for two hours. No bubbles, no delamination, but a haze develops inside the specimens during thè test. Such a haze is totally reversible within 3 to 5 days. When submitted to the Bake Test (ASA Test No 5) in which specimens are kept for two hours at 100°C in an oven, no bubbles, no delamination, no haze develops on the Securi- f lex specimens which fully withstand the Test. Moisture in the atmosphere - The ASA Test for windshield evaluation is the Humidity Test (ASA Test No 3) in which specimens are kept for 14 days in an atmosphere at 55°C and 100 fo relative humidity with permanent deposition of condensed water on the specimen. The evaluation is made referring to "the delamination. No bubbles, no delamination, but a haze develops</page><page sequence="8">1 1 08 O. JANDELEIT AND R. O RAIN inside the Securiflex specimens during the test. Such a haze is fully reversible within 4 to 6 days after the Test. Such a haze was never observed on samples exposed in the actual tropi- cal climate of Guiana. Weathering - The ASA Test No 16 is not re- quired for windshield but for plastic materials. The Securiflex construction withstands the condi- tions of this test. Change of temperature - There is no ASA Test to check the performance of the windshield face to change of tempersture. But since a plastic material is used as innerlayer bonded to glass in the Securiflex construction, Securiflex curved windshields were submitted to ASA Test No 28 (Resistance to temperature change, for bullet resistant glazing materials) as well as to other tests as shown in Table 3» Some flat specimens were also submitted to additional tests to measure eventual change of adhesion. According to both series with wind- shields and flat specimens, it is concluded that 1 . there is always a sufficient level of adhesion of the Securiflex innerlayer to glass, after stay at extreme temperatures or after change of temperature. 2. there is no evidence of any change in visual appearance, haze, delamination, cracks... after stay at extreme temperatures or after change of temperature. The present analysis of the performance of the plastic material as innerlayer of the Securiflex windshield shows that the specific behaviour of the Securiflex construction in three of the ASA standard Tests for windshields, namely Boil Test, Humidity Test and Abrasion Test, does not fit with the actual performance of Securiflex exposed for an extended period of time to high temperatures and high level of mois- ture in the atmosphere, and in car use. Conse- quently, the approval procedure has to be dis- cussed and established for such a new product. OTHER USUAL OR EVENTUAL ACTIONS TO THE INNER SURFACE OF A WINDSHIELD - Cleaning is the action most likely to damage the inner surface of a windshield. And cleaning represents a mechani- cal action (see above), possibly combined with action of chemical agents, in particular for de- icing, fog, cigarette smoke, fogging removing. Since the inner surface of the windshield is a plastic material, it was also necessary to evaluate the eventual inconvenience due to static electricity and flammability. Chemical resistance - Dirty traces on the inner surface of the car windshield are the re- sult of: 1. road environment, which reaches the inte- rior of the compartment through air pipes or nozzles 2. compartment environment, with cigarette smoke, plasticizer deposition from plastic mate- rials of dash board, seats, etc. or inadvertent contact of various products like lip-stick, chewing-gum, fruit juice, etc.. Wet cloth or chamois skin are commonly used for cleaning, but some additional agents are also commonly used to facilitate cleaning. Consequently, some series of polluted specimens were tested with some series of chemical agents, to check the efficiency of cleaning which was evaluated with respect to ease of totally re- moving the dirty marks, as well as the chemical resistance of the cleaned surface, which was evaluated with respect to eventual development of haze, tackiness, crazing or apparent loss of transparency, as required in ASA Tests No 19 and 20. Results are reported in Table 4 and below: 1 . Lipstick marks are easily removed with a dry cloth. Moisture from breath to the area to be cleaned helps. 2. Chewing-gum can be removed with fingers and finger-nails. It is easier to remove dry gum than fresher one. After removing the gum, there is a slight superficial deformation which dis- appears within a few hours. 3. Ice-cream traces can be easily removed with a wet cloth. A slight "orange skin" pattern develops on the plastic surface under the traces if removed only after 2 to 3 days. Such pattern disappears in time. 4. Coca-cola or orange-juice traces are easy to remove with a wet cloth. 5. The plastic surface is not easy to be marked by a ball pen. Eventual traces are remov- able with alcohol or acetone, 6. Water resistant felt pencil traces are removable with alcohol. 7. Cigarette extinguishing on the interior of the windshield: 1 cigarette: no trace 3 cigarettes extinguished at the same place: slight or ange -skin pattern 10 cigarettes: yellow spot 43 cigarettes: dark yellow spot, partial deterioration • In addition, the combination of mechanical and chemical actions of cleaning was simulated with the cleaning machine described, as well as conditions of testing and results, in Appendix No 2. Finally, the standard tests of ASA Code (Test No 19) &gt; StVZO (German standards) and ISO, for chemical resistance evaluation of plastic mate- rials, were conducted with no adverse effect to the Securiflex innerlayer. See Table 5- In conclusion, the recommendation for clean- ing the interior of Securiflex windshield would be as following: 1. in most cases, use WATER as basic cleaning agent, applied with a spong or a chamois skin. If not sufficient, use a solution of detergent in water (like most of glass cleaning agents on the market) 2. exceptionally, if dirty traces resist (for example stick-on-label glue), the best is to use mineral spirit. Such procedure could be áso recommended to clean conventional windshields.

Static electricity - Since it is well known that most of the plastic materials are more or less static charge carriers, the inner surface of Securiflex was evaluated with respect to eventual inconvenience. The purpose was to eval- uate the effect of actions such as cleaning and air blowing to the plastic surface. Accordingly, the following pragmatic Tests were achieved on Securiflex specimens compared to glass and vari- ous plastic specimens, namely Polyamid, Cellulose aceto butyrate, Polyester, Polyvinyl- chloride , Polymethylmethacrylate , Polycarbonate s</page><page sequence="10">Ilio o.

HANDLING AND MOUNTING The mas s -pro duct ion processes of manufactur- ing cars cannot always easily fit to eventual specific conditions of handling and mounting a new component. Consequently, it was useful to evaluate the ability of Securiflex to fit with Electro-static fieldmeter Q 475 Kleinwächter, 785O Lörrach West Germany usual methods and processes in which the wind- shield is involved at the car manufacturer's plant. Studies about some specific questions which could arise with Securiflex, because of its plastic innerlayer, were undertaken. Thfey con- cern in particular: fixing the windshield to the car body, fixing the base of rear view mirror to the windshield, sticky labels on the windshield, "tunnel" bake Test. FIXING THE WINDSHIELD TO THE CAR BODY - There is no specific problem to fix the windshield to the car body by means of a rubber gasket, as commonly used in european cars when they have not to withstand FMVSS No 212. In case of bonding, the Securiflex windshield can be delivered with a peripheric zone 1 /2 inch wide, free of innerlayer (which provides no change to the properties of the windshield in case of impact), then there is no particular conditions for bonding to the body if compared with conventional windshield. However it was considered useful to test Securiflex bonding with no consideration of this opportunity and with consideration of some kinds of adhesive strips used by the car manufacturers: 1 . electrically-heatable chloroprene strip (Solbit from Bostik) 2.

ORAIN 5. impact strength after ageing (heat, humid- ity, cold water, UV radiation, coldness) 6. fatigue before and after ageing The Securiflex windshield bonded with the three tested kinds of adhesive materials with- stands the specified requirements. FIXING HEAR VIEW MIRROR RETAINER BUTTON TO THE WINDSHIELD - Fixing the inner rear view mirror button to the windshield is common in America and under development in Europe. In Europ, double-side adhesive film is occasionally used, but in some recent developments, an ana- erobic acrylic adhesive material is used, poly- merized by UV radiation or by chemical action. Such an adhesive material was tested to bond mirror retainer button made of Zamac to Securi- flex (Loctite No 356 and Loctite No 312 adhe- sive materials). The following requirements were taken into accounts Two series of specimens are previously sub- mitted to two conditions of ageing: 7 days at 70°C for one series of specimens, 1 hour at 100°C for the second series. Afterwards, both series are submitted to the following ageing conditions before a cleavage resistance Test, the effort being applied paral - lely to the bonding surface at 25 mm of it: 1. After 22 h at 20°C. Required cleavage resistance (RCR)&gt;50 daN 2. After JO h at 60°C and 95 $ relative humidity RCR&gt; 50 daN 3* After 50 000 cycles of shearing fatigue at i 10 daN, frequency 3 Hz - RCR&gt; 50 daN 4« After 3 cycles, .75 h each. Xenontest - RCR&gt;50 daN 5. After 30 minutes at 110°C, measurement before cooling back to room temperature - RCR&gt;3 daN Samples of both series are also submitted to a shock resistance Test at 20°C and -30°C. Zamac retainer bonding to Securiflex with Loctite 312 and Loctite 356 adhesive materials withstands the requirements. STICKY LABELS ON THE WINDSHIELD - Sticky labels on windshields may be either provisional, like identification labels at the car manufac- turer's plant, or for extended period of time, like tax labels. The following types of adhesive materials and bases have been tested with respect to the level of adhesion and easiness to remove, after ageing: 1 . Polyvinyl acetate and butyl acrylate coated on cellulose acetate 2. Butyl polyacrylate coated on PVC 3. Chloroprene, Mg resinate and phenolic resin in solvants, coated on any kind of base 4. Polyvinyl pyrrolidone, glycerin and paraf finie wax coated on any kind of base. The following ageing conditions have been successively considered: 1 • one minute at room conditions 2. 48 hours at room conditions 3. 22 hours at 80°C 4« 22 hours at -30°C 5. 70 hours at 40°C and 90 fo Relative Humid- ity 6. 10 cycles (6 hours at - 40°C 6 hours at + 80°C and 90 Ì° R.H.) 7. 10 cycles (4 hours at -30°C 4 hours at + 70°C and 80 $ R.H.) Results are as following: 1 . in all cases the level of adhesion remains sufficient. 2. Adhesive materials types 1 and 2 can he removed rather easily, hut traces of adhesive material stay on the innerlayer. They are easily removed with mineral spirit. 3« Adhesive type 3 cannot be removed with no damage to the innerlayer. 4. Adhesive type Ą can be removed rather easily • Traces of adhesive material on the innerlayer can be easily removed with water. "TUNNEL" BAKE TEST - The windshield may be exposed to the heat of an oven, at the car manufacturer's plant, if painting has to be re- touched after assembling the car. The most severe conditions usually met in tunnel oven of car manufacturer's plants result in a tempera- ture of 90 to 105°C on the inner side of the windshield, this highest range of temperatures being kept for 15 to 20 minutes. Consequently, we consider that in conventional as well as in Securiflex windshields no bubbles must develop up to a temperature of 110°C kept for 30 minutes No flat specimens but windshields are tested in an , oven, with such conditions. Securiflex wind- shièld fully succeeds in this test. Such specific studies as described above are to be rather considered as examples. They lead to the general feeling that Securiflex use does not involve basic problems for the car manufac- turers. But it is an evidence that there is a large variety of specific details in the assem- bling process of each car manufacturer, which could involve specific questions with respect to Securiflex use. But these questions are not to be considered as fundamental, and a specific study must lead easily to an acceptable solution. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 1 . The basic optical properties of Securiflex stand at the same level as those of the conven- tional windshield. 2. Securiflex provides complete protection from laceration in the Peugeot 504 &amp;t barrier collisions up to 65 km/h. The potential Brain Injury is slightly higher for the Securiflex than for the standard windshield in the same evaluation program, but the difference is not considered significant. 3* Securiflex provides a substantial improv- ment to the protection of the occupants from impact of flying object, simulated by a steel ball at room temperatures ranging from 15 to 23 °C: the threshold of penetration is about 25 fo higher with Securiflex than with the convention-</page><page sequence="13">NON-LACERATIVE WINDSHIELD 1113 al windshield, and there is no glass particles projection inside the compartment up to the penetration impact velocity. 4. Simulated cleaning, abrasion and scratching in laboratory, as well as in-car-use operation demonstrate that the plastic inner- layer of the Securiflex windshield is suitable for long term service in automobiles. 5. Simulated ageing in laboratory as well as extended exposure to extreme climates demonstra- te that the Securiflex construction withstands high temperatures, high level of moisture in the atmosphere, combined action of temperature, moisture and solar radiation, as well as change of temperature. 6. Laboratory investigations as well as in- car-use operation demonstrate that the plastic innerlayer of the Securiflex windshield with- stands usual or eventual action of chemical agents, and does not present any particular problem versus static electricity and flammabil- ity. 7. Handling and mounting Securiflex at the car manufacturer's plant provide no basic ques- tion in the process. But some details of the process could have to be checked relating to their compatibility with the plastic innerlayer of the windshield. It is obvious that facial lacerations due to head impact to the windshield occur in the field And, even if seldom dangerous to life, such in- juries often involve painful consequences, psy- chological, social, financial consequences. A windshield construction such as Securiflex can be considered as a new generation of high safety windshield, as far as the control of a special plastic material, of its transformation to a highly transparent plastic film, of combining and assembling it with some conventional materi- als leads to a windshield construction which effectively eliminates facial laceration at substantial collision severity, and whichihas demonstrated its suitability for long term service in automobiles.

APPENDIX I LIGHT STABILITY OF THE SECURIFLEX CONSTRUCTION - The Securiflex light stability has been checked according to DIN 53 389 (light stability checking project) , the conditions of which are reported below: Twelve 185 x 65 nim Securiflex specimens are fixed on a revolving platform, inside an ATLAS- 25/1 8-WR weather-o-meter . At the center is a 25OO Wat t-XBF 25OO W/1 -Xenon lamp, at a distance of about 25O mm from the specimens. Specimens turn around the lamp, with 1 revolution/minute, the face of specimens to be glazed on the out- side of the vehicle facing the lamp. The lamp is water cooled between internal and external Pyrex filters. Water-cooling also works as an infra- red radiation filter. With such a device, irradiation to the spec- imens is the same as irradiation from sun, without filter, at sea level. The total irradia- tion intensity decreases about 10 $ during the I5OO hours exposure period, and UV irradiation intensity decreases about 20 The luminous intensity on specimens is about I50 000 Lux. Radiation is continuous, there is no day/night cycle. Temperature of the black panel ranges from 45 to 58°C, and air and specimen tempera- ture in testing field from 29 to 43 °C, with a relative humidity from 35 to 70 io . Intermediate luminous transmittance measures made on three among the twelve specimens after 437 9 1012 and I510 hours irradiation are report- ed in Table 6. APPENDIX II SIMULATION OF MECHANICAL AND CHEMICAL ACTION of cleaning the inner surface of a wind- shield - The machine reproduces a manual clean- ing motion (See Fig. 8) . To simulate the action of the hand, the cleaning pad, which is made of a 8 cm diameter wooden plate covered with a chamois skin, is pressed on the test surface resulting in a pressure of 40 gms/sq.cm cor- responding to the pressure exerted when cleaning by hand. The center of the round cleaning pad moves in an ellipse with a 17 cm major axis and a 8 cm minor axis at a frequency of 1 cycle per second. A carriage moves the cleaning pad over the test specimen a distance of 27 cm in 3 minutes (I8O cycles) after which it reverses direction. A cleaning agent is supplied by means of a hole in the middle of the pad. Cleaning agent (about 7 ml) is added when the surface becomes dry (about every 10 minutes). With this equipment, one can study the ef- fect of mechanical cleaning action combined with action of cleaning agents on glazing (See above). The basic test is to run about 30 000 elliptical cycles, which represent a very inten- sive weekly cleaning (50 cycles per 250 x 350 mm area) for more than 10 years. Haze increase of the specimen is measured periodically during and after the test. Various kinds of cleaning solutions were tested:</page><page sequence="14">ììl4 o. JANDELEIT AND R.

APPENDIX III SCRATCHING TEST PROCEDURE - A diamond needle of standardized dimensions is pressed with a controlled load (measured in grams) on a flat specimen of the tested surface. The speci- men is clamped on a turntable, so that the needle follows concentric circles on the tested surface, one circle for each load. Increasing loads are successively applied to the surface, on increasing radius circles. The scratch resistance of the tested surface is measured in grams by the maximum load which does not leave any permanent scratch mark on the surface.</page></plain_text>
