<plain_text><page sequence="1">314 REVIEWS Ecology, Vol. 33, No. 2 The choice of the title is unfortunate since it implies that the book is about all of the birds of Arizona, whereas it is only about some of the birds in less than one-tenth of the state. It is more adequately described in the lengthy subtitle, "A naturalist's adventures with the nesting birds on the deserts, grasslands, foot- hills and mountains of southeastern Arizona." When first leafing through the pages of this huge book, one has the impression that it is merely a verbose narrative of the birding experiences of a man who is particularly proud of his "life list," and who was nearly overwhelmed by the splendor of Arizona. However, after reading the introduction and various sections in the body of the book, it is discovered that the author has attempted to create a technical treatise on the breeding birds of a diverse and highly interest- ing area. He has been thoroughly impressed by the need for the "scientific method" in orni- thology and constantly calls the reader's atten- tion, with pride, to his methods of collecting data, even allowing one a glimpse of a page from his field notes (p. 640). Nevertheless, the book is in no sense "scientific," although one cannot doubt the sincere intentions of the author. If one has the patience to struggle through the tremendous mass of words, which the re- viewer is under moral obligation to do, he will find the text studded with anthropomorphisms, exaggerations, and inaccuracies. For example, the cowbird which is childless and lax in its morals (pp. 160-161 ); the entire chapter (Chap. 42) which is devoted to an account of the dis- covery of a new race of wren (Troglodytes brunneicollis vorhiesi), which, in spite of being the first record of this species north of Mexico, hardly warrants the sensationalism which the author has given it; and the fact that the egg of a turkey is precocial (p. 636). There is only a very occasional reference in the text to the published literature and no list of what little has been cited, although the author must be familiar with the many publications on the avi- fauna of Arizona, since he says (p. xiv), that he has spent every free hour over a period of several years in research. The book is not without some merits, how- ever. It is beautifully printed and bound, and there is a splended collection of color plates, line drawings, and photographs by well-known artists and photographers. If one is willing to search through the book, he will find frequent references to the fact that the breeding season of many species may be delayed by prolonged dry seasons. Also, there are suggestions that the clutch-sizes of some species rise during, or even prior to, unusually wet periods, although the author is apparently unaware of the current interest and publications on these matters. One finds a useful annotated list of the breeding birds of the area studied (Sec. 6), and a long discussion of the avian populations in the various life zones of the region (Chap. 3). A descrip- tion of a new race of martin (Progne subis oberholseri) is presented. (p. 669), although such a book seems an inappropriate place for a taxonomic description. The work will be of interest to those who collect beautiful bird books, but it hardly does justice to the avifauna of the state of which the author exclaims (p. 1) "Arizona! Magic is thy melodious name !" RAYMOND A. PAYNTER, JR. PEABODY MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, YALE UNIVERSITY, NEW HAVEN, CONNECTICUT STUDIES OF GULLS Few comprehensive long-term studies have been made of the breeding biology of colonial birds, owing to the usual inaccessibility of large avian populations and to the difficulties en- countered when dealing with vast numbers of highly mobile animals. Within the past year two excellent publications concerned with avian aggregations have appeared, which are notable not only because they have resulted from years of careful observations, but also because of their fundamental ecological significance. Un- doubtedly they will serve as touch-stones for future population work. The first of these publications is a five-year study made by Paludan 1 of a colony of 1,200 1 Paludan, Knud. 1951.

AND PENGUINS pairs of herring gulls (Larus argentatus) and a colony of 1,000 pairs of lesser black-backed gulls (Larus fuscus), nesting on a group of is- lands in the Baltic. Most of the paper is con- cerned with a very useful account of the breed- ing behavior of the two species, which often differs markedly, but of even greater interest is the discussion of the population dynamics of the herring gull. It was found that the clutch-size of the herring gull was almost invariably three eggs, although this could be reduced by the addition of foreign eggs to the nest shortly before egg laying began. Egg mortality was highly variable, but in a year in which there were no floods approximately ten per cent of the eggs failed to hatch. Chick mortality was heaviest during the first eight days after hatching, when seventy per cent of the young died. As the birds became older it</page><page sequence="2">April, 1952 REVIEWS 315 was increasingly difficult to find them and to note their deaths, but it was estimated that not more than twenty per cent lived to leave the colony, or, in other words, less than one chick for each two pairs of adults. A life table was constructed using nearly 1,000 recoveries of gulls banded as fledglings in Den- mark from 1917 to 1942. Only birds recovered after August 30 of the year in, which they were banded were included in the study in order to confine the life table to fully fledged birds. How- ever, the rate of recovery for the first-year birds is probably disproportionately high because newly-fledged birds remain near the colony and are more easily recovered than the older, wide- ranging gulls. Before it was possible to employ the life table data to ascertain whether sufficient young were being produced to maintain the population, it was necessary to establish the age at which the gulls begin to breed. Heretofore the herring gull has usually been thought to breed in its fourth year, since it is known that fully adult plumage is acquired in the fourth year and birds in immature plumage are rarely seen in a colony. Paludan found a breeding third-year gull in sub-adult plumage and from this slim evidence concluded that most of the birds breed in their third year, but that the banded individual was retarded in attaining its adult plumage. A more reasonable interpretation would appear to be that this was a bird breeding unusually early. The life table indicates that there is 62 per cent mortality in the first year of adult life and that the rate then drops to roughly 15 per cent annually. Paludan points out that if 150 of every 1,000 sexually mature birds die animally, they must be replaced by 150 gulls which are breeding for the first time, if the population is to remain constant. It is difficult to estimate how many young must fledge in order to yield 150 adults two and one half years later, \vhen, according to Paludan, they begin to breed, since the first year mortality rate as calculated in the life table is probably too high. However, using these figures, it was found that approximately 600 birds must be fledged. This is slightly more than one chick per pair of adults and twice the estimated production of the colony. Yet, in Denmark, as in North America, the population is known to be increasing. If the gulls do not breed until their fourth year the discrepancy is even greater. Paludan then analyzed the earlier herring gull life tables of Marshall (Auk, 64: 188-198, 1947) and of Paynter (Bird-Banding, 18: 156- 170, 1947) and found that the annual rate of mortality for sexually mature birds in North America is 29 per cent as opposed to 15 per cent in Denmark. Because the oldest record available for the North American life table compiled by Marshall is only 17 years, while there were five recoveries in the 26-year group in the Danish material, Paludan thought that the lower annual mortality rate for his birds may have been brought about by the longer span of the Danish study. To test for this, all of the Danish recoveries older than 17 years were discarded and the annual survival data were plotted on a semi-log graph and compared with the North American curve. The Danish mortality rate was raised somewhat but it was still considerably lower than the North Amer- ican rate. It was then concluded that the dif- ference is real, although the cause of the varia- tion is unknown. There is possibly one serious objection to this conclusion. In spite of the elaborate cor- rections which were necessary before Marshall's rather inadequate life table could be used, Palu- dan neglected the fact that although the North American table was constructed from returns from a 25-year period, very few gulls were banded in the early part of the period. In fact, Marshall included recoveries for only the years prior to 1940 and stated (op. cit., p. 190), ". . . few Herring Gulls were banded in this country before 1921, ...." Therefore, recov- eries of gulls even 17 years of age were very unlikely, simply because so few had been banded for so long. The importance of older birds in reducing the mean annual mortality rate may be very important, as has been shown by Paynter (Ecology, 30: 146-166, 1949) in a later life table covering returns for 11 years, which, un- fortunately, apparently was not seen by Paludan. In this paper it was shown that if one per cent of the birds live 25 years the mortality rate would drop to 14.5 per cent. It is interesting to note that approximately 0.5 per cent of Paludan's birds lived to their twenty-sixth year and the mean annual mortality was 15 per cent, which seems to confirm the earlier speculations of Paynter. It appears, therefore, that eventually the life tables for the Danish and the North American gulls will be found to be similar. The fact that the Danish colony does not seem to be producing sufficient young to maintain the population may not be at all serious. In the Kent Island colony in New Brunswick Paynter found that only 50 per cent of the young are fledged. The 80 per cent loss estimated by Paludan may be found to be considerably lower if better techniques for locating the young can be devised. Also, it is possible that the mortality rate for the young chicks was abnormally high in the year in which the study was made. The second of these outstanding publications on avian populations is the product of a ten- year study by Richdale of the sexual behavior of the yellow-eyed penguin (Megadytes anti-</page><page sequence="3">316 REVIEWS Ecology, Vol. 33, No. 2 podcs) on the Otago Peninsula in New Zea- land.2 The scope of the book is broader than the title would imply, since the term "sexual be- havior" has been broadly interpreted to include information on measurements, weights, and molts, but only when they have some bearing on the general sexual behavior of the species. There are frequent discussions of similar pat- terns of behavior in. other penguins as well as in other birds. These increase the breadth of the work and make it more useful to the reader who may be interested in the more general as- pects of avian sexual behavior, rather than spe- cifically in penguin behavior. There is an un- fortunate paucity of references to European literature, but the difficulties in securing these publications in New Zealand are great and the author can hardly be blamed for his unfamiliarity with them. A unique feature of the study, aside from the many years it required, is the author's intimate knowledge of each bird. This was achieved by banding every individual with especially made bands which could be read with the aid of a telescope at considerable distances. The idio- syncrasies of each of the 88 males and 96 fe- males, in nearly 300 matings, are thereby fully known. The body of the book consists of ten chapters which in turn deal with the scope of the study, an analysis of the types of behavior, pair forma- 2 Richdale, L. E. 1951.

At the end of each chapter there is a very useful summary. The appendices are concerned with accounts of the behavior of individual birds, which are too detailed to be of general interest, but offer an insight into the thorough nature of the study and the material from which the gen- eral conclusions were drawn. The plates are an integral part of the work and illustrate, often strikingly, many of the postures discussed in the text. It is unfortunate that unskillful retouch- ing has marred a number of them. Anthropomorphism has been scrupulously avoided, although in glancing through the pages the reader wvill note frequent references to "sheepish looks," "glares," "divorce," etc. These have been used to describe particular actions and do not bear the strict connotations associated with human behavior. The choice of these terms appears unfortunate at times, but as they are defined rigorously and used consistently they do not detract from the work if one first reads the definitions presented by the author. In a short review it is impossible to do justice to the wealth of entirely new information found in this book. Without doubt it is one of the classic ornithological studies of the century and should maintain its high position for many years. RAYMOND A. PAYNTER, JR.
