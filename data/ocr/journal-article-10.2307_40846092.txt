<plain_text><page sequence="1">The second Mandala of the Rigveda. In the Sitzungsberichte der königlich preussi- schen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin (1900, xxix) Professpr Weber discusses the composition of this Magala, suggesting that it consists of two parts of different date, and that in the later collection we find traces of a tendency to depose from his throne the popular god Indra in favour of the priestly deity Brahmanaspati or Bjihaspati. In attestation of this view Professor Weber brings for- ward, amongst other evidence, a list of the infinitive forms which occur in this Magala , upon the lines of H. Brunn- hofer's article in KZ. xxv. 329 ff. (1879). From these forms he is only able to draw the conclusion that the second Magala is 'somewhat archaic' in its use of infinitive forms. Professor Weber adds "es ist doch bedauerlich dass, so weit ich mich erinnere, nach seinem Vorgange nicht bereits auch über andere dergleichen grammatische Bildungen ähnliche statistische Untersuchungen mittlerweile erfolgt sind, deren Resultate allerdings wohl mit etwas grösserer Vorsicht, als er dies gethan hat, zu verwerthen sein würden". Professor Weber thus gives the weight of his great au- thority in favour of the 'linguistic' method of investigating the historical development of the Çigveda, which is now depreciated in so many quarters. But before attempting to supply the statistical results which Professor Weber desires as a test of his own theory , it will be well to consider why Brunnhofer's conclusions have proved so unsatisfactory. I find the chief reason of his failure in the inadequacy of his material in quantity. He investigates the infinitive forms only, of which there are less than a thousand in the whole Çigveda, and hardly fifty in this Mandala. Even of those quoted by Weber several are very doubtful infinitive forms, whilt others are of little historical importance, be- cause they are almost equally used in several successive epochs. In my view it is the duty of an investigator upon linguistic' principles to commence his work by making the Zeitschrift für vergi. Sprachf N. F. XVII. 4. 29</page><page sequence="2">430 Edward V. Arnold, fullest possible collection of the material which he judges to be of value. In selecting words and forms of historical im- portance I have myself applied tests with which only a few of the infinitive forms comply r and yet I have found that the occurrences number over 20 000 in the whole Rigveda, and about 850 in this Mandala. Only by these comparatively large numbers is it possible to eliminate the element of un- certainty or chance, which is due to the fact that the deve- lopment of language does not proceed at a uniform speed, but is modified by innumerable influences of which it is im- possible to give a measured record. From the narrow basis adopted by Brunnhofer very slight conclusions could be drawn, except for two hypotheses of the author, both of which are without sufficient foundation. It is assumed first that the family collections of the Rigveda (including such hymns in books ix and x as are ascribed to the respective families) may be regarded as units and arranged in order of time. This is not permissible. The family collections, like the various liturgical collections used in our own day, are on the whole synchronous: but each includes matter both old and new. On the other hand, the matter which stands outside the family collections, particularly in book x., is generally of later date, no matter who the traditional author may be. It is unnecessary to dwell further on this point, because it is assumed by Professor Weber when he commences his inquiry into the relative date of various parts of the Mandala. It may however be noticed that Brunnhofer's conclusion that the Bhãrgava hymns are relatively late is mainly based upon the infinitive forms which occur in the hymns in book x. attributed to the Bhãrgava family. Secondly, Brunnhofer assumed that whilst the ancient Sanskrit possessed the category of infinitive forms throughout, a succession of forms was used to express the required meaning in different epochs. The picture presented to us by the hymns is different. In all the earlier hymns we find a large variety of infinitive forms used side by side: but in the latest hymns, the Atharvaveda, and classical Sanskrit, this number is greatly restricted, until in the end the form in -turn only is employed. But whilst the earlier language</page><page sequence="3">The second Mandala of the IJigveda. 431 draws no clear distinction between the infinitive and certain case forms of verbal abstract nouns, the later language places the infinitive in the distinct grammatical category in which we also find it in Greek and Latin. Nevertheless, Brunnhofer's collection of material may be used, with proper corrections, to establish certain provisional results. The first correction applies to the forms in -táye gene- rally. These Brunnhofer asserts, I know not on what ground, to be characteristic of the period of the Brãhmaças, and therefore notes of late date. I find, on the other hand, that there are 264 occurrences of this infinitive in the Çigveda, and only 4 in the Atharvaveda: later it has disappeared altogether. I have therefore no hesitation in reckoning these infinitives as notes of early date. In drawing up the list of such infinitives, only those words should, in my opinion, be included in which the dative forms are either exclusively, or at any rate principally, used: and I therefore exclude from the list the forms utáye (ii. 32. 8, 34. 14), çrushtáye (ii. 38. 2) and ¿u-astáye (ii. 2. 6. 32. 8) which are rather datives of verbal nouns. These are also amongst the forms of which Professor Weber is inclined to question the infinitival character. On the other hand com- pounds like vãjasãtáye and somapltáye seem to me rightly classed as infinitives, on account of the comparative rarity of the corresponding forms of other cases. However such forms may be classified, they are at any rate specially characteristic of the Iligveda. There is a further occurrence of somapttáye, not noted in the list given by Weber after Brunnhofer, in ii. 41. 21; devavitáye occurs ii. 23. 7. Of the forms in -ase, ávase appears to me distinctively a noun-form. As to cákshase and jiváse, both words are so freely used in the Atharvaveda that they must be excluded from a list of Çigvedic forms. On the other hand dhâyase (ii. 17. 2) should be included. With these corrections, it appears that Mandala ii con- tains seventeen distinct formations of the infinitive, with forty-three occurrences. The only classical form, that in -turn, does not appear. So far the collection agrees in cha- racter with the Rigveda as a whole, or in Professor Weber's 29*</page><page sequence="4">432 Edward V. Arnold, words "es erhellt jedenfalls, dass das zweite Mancala hin- sichtlich der Infinitivbildung immerhin auf einem altertümlichen Standpunkte steht." If we further enquire which of these infinitive forms characterise the oldest parts of the Çigveda, and to what deities the hymns in which they occur are addressed, the result will be somewhat as follows. The forms in -táye, -dhyai, -vane, and -ase (excepting as before cákshase and jiváse) are those which shew the most rapid falling off in frequency of occurrence as we pass from the Çigveda to the Atharvaveda. The statistics on this point will be found in my article on Historical Vedic Grammar (JAOS. xviii, p. 313). These forms are therefore the most distinctive notes of early date, and they occur in this Mandala as shewn below : ii. 1. 10 Agni daváne 2. 6 „ vïtaye 5. 7 „ dhâyase 11. 1 Indra dãváne 12 „ daváne 17. 2 „ dhâyase 6 „ çayádhyai 23. 7 Brahmanaspati devavitáye 31. 3 Viçve Devãh vãjasãtáye 41. 1 Indra- Vãyu somapítáye 21 Dyãvãprithiví somapítáye These forms therefore occur in eight only out of the forty-one hymns of this book, and they go to shew that these hymns are as early as any in the Çigveda. There are included four occurrences in the twelve hymns. addressed to Indra, and one occurrence in the four hymns addressed to Brahmajiaspati or Brihaspati. This test therefore fails to indicate any difference of date in the hymns addressed to these two deities respectively, the number of occurrences being too small, and the difference of ratio too trifling, to allow any conclusions to be drawn. I shall now endeavour to shew how far a more definite conclusion may be reached by the use of a far greater mass of material, and by breaking up the Çigveda into sections,</page><page sequence="5">The second Mancala of the Rigveda. 433 not in accordance with the reputed authorship of each hymn, but in accordance with a precise analysis of its metre. This method can only be fully displayed by a discussion embracing the whole of the Çigveda; but I gladly take the present opportunity of applying it to a single Magala, as an ex- periment preliminary to the larger undertaking. The criteria which I propose affect partly the grammar and partly the vocabulary of the language. Amongst the former I include the use of pronouns, adjectives expressing order in time or place, and adverbs and other particles. All words of this type belong to the formal part of language, and to a large extent perform functions of the same character as the inflections of nouns and verbs. The vocabulary proper will seem to many to be of less value as a test of date, and the notes connected with it are therefore tabulated separa- tely. The result, however, shews that the changes in voca- bulary run precisely parallel to the grammatical changes, and in the discussion of small sections of matter, they are of equal value. I assume also that we have to deal with two bodies of literary matter, each of which is fairly homogeneous in itself: the Çigveda proper on the one hand, and the later Çigveda and the Atharvaveda on the other. That the "later Çigveda" is on the whole in linguistic agreement with the Atharvaveda is generally conceded: most plainly by Professor Bloomfield in his recent work on the Atharvaveda, in which he contracts the "hieratic" language of the Çigveda with the "popular" language of the hymns usually described as belonging to the later Çigveda' and of the Atharvaveda. The list of hymns belonging to the 'later Çigveda' is provisionally taken from that arrived at by me in KZ. N. F. xiv, pp. 337-343 : a statistical proof of the accuracy of this list as a whole is given by me in JAOS. xviii, p. 234. Professor Bloomfield has, however, contended that the difference between the "hieratic" and "popular" languages is not necessarily one of date; and, as a matter of fact, he believes them to have been contemporary dialects. This contention can only be properly examined when the differences between the two dialects have first been duly observed and arranged. As a matter of practical convenience I use for</page><page sequence="6">434 Edward V. Arnold, the present the terms 'early' and 'late', in accordance with the generally received opinion: should Professor Bloomfield's view be established, seme such terms as umore hieratic" and "more popular" will need to be substituted for them. I am not however prepared to admit that the terms 'early' and 'late' have been proved to be inaccurate in this connexion. Their meaning must not be misunderstood. By a 'note of early date' is meant one of those forms or words which is characteristic of an earlier body of literature : by a 'note of late date* one of those forms or words which is characteristic of a later body of literature. But it is not assumed that the former disappear at a particular turning- point in history from the spoken or the written language: or that the latter were created at the same moment ex nihilo. Many of the 'older' forms were revived from time to time in later writers: as is remarked by Boehtlingk-Roth on rádhas tíim Bhãgavatapurãça ist das Wort wieder künst- lich von den Todten auferweckt." Many of the 'later' forms were in use to some extent in much earlier times, and have cognates in other Indo-European languages: but they were not so used as to be characteristic of the earlier literature. Of the grammatical notes hundreds are examined in Whitney's Sanskrit Grammar: and this eminent scholar, all whose work was based upon the elaborate statistical collections made by himself and his pupils, never found any other explanation necessary than the later date of the Atharvaveda. If this position is to be questioned, it must be by a careful study of the linguistic differences as a whole, not by the arbitrary selection of one or two only of the 'notes', of which it may seem easy at first sight to depreciate the value. In other words the evidence must always be cumulative. It is not claimed that any hymn is 'old' because it contains a 'note of early date': but if a hymn contains a great pre- ponderance of such notes, there is a presumption of an early date corresponding in strength to that preponderance. Nor is it claimed that every word or form characteristic of the Atharvaveda is historically later than any word or form characteristic of the Çigveda: but if there is amongst the Atharvan 'notes' a preponderance of those which bear the</page><page sequence="7">The second Mandala of the IJigveda. 435 stamp of later linguistic development, the date of the Athar- van must be judged accordingly. Single words and forms may be reckoned as notes of 'early' or 'late' date either because they occur proportionately more often in one or the other body of literature, or because they occur exclusively there. To ascertain the first point it is necessary to determine the relative bulk of the older and later literature. This I have attempted by two methods. The first method4 is to reckon the number of instances that occur in them of certain of the commonest grammatical forms, the 'early' and 'late' forms being taken together. The result is as follows.

The second method of reckoning is by the number of syllables, as they may be inferred from the metres of the single hymns. These I estimate roughly as follows: Çigveda proper 353,000 Late Çigveda 52,500 Atharvaveda 154,750 207,250</page><page sequence="8">436 Edward V. Arnold, This gives a ratio of 353 to 207, or 1.75 to 1. Neither in this nor in the preceding reckoning do I take account of any padas in the Jjtigveda which are repeated, except for the first three times, nor of any concluding padas or stanzas which, as repetitions, are omitted in Aufrecht's text. This may partly account for the divergence between my reckoning and that of the Anuvãkanukramaçi (MacdoneÜ's History of Sanskrit Literature, p. 272), who gives the number of syllables in the whole Çigveda as 432 000. In the Athar- vaveda I do not reckon any passages which are in substance repetitions of matter belonging to the earlier or later JjÜgveda. As the result of these two reckonings the bulk of the Çigveda proper may be estimated as 1.8 times that of the later Çigveda and Atharvaveda together: that is, the ratio is that of 9 to 5. A form that occurs 9 times in the Çigveda proper for each occurrence in the two later parts therefore occurs proportionately five times as often: if it occurs 27/s times in the later parts for each occurrence in the Çigveda proper, it is proportionately five times as frequent in the later literature. Slightly raising the standards for practical convenience, we reach the following definitions: - (a) An 'early' form is one which occurs in the Çigveda proper ten times as often as in the later Çigveda and Athar- vaveda. (b) A 'late' form is one which occurs in the later $ig- veda and Atharvaveda three times as often as in the Çigveda proper. This rule may be applied strictly if the number of forms occurring in the Çigveda proper in the first case is at least 40, and in the later Çigveda and Atharvaveda in the latter case at least 22. Forms shewing half that number of occur- rences may be admitted if there are no occurrences at all in the other part Between these limits the proportion re- quired should be increased as the absolute number of forms diminishes. I thus arrive at the following criteria, in which, as in my previous articles, the symbol AB denotes the Çig- veda proper, C the later Çigveda tod the Atharvaveda taken together.</page><page sequence="9">The second Mandala of the ßigveda. 437 (a) 'Early' forms and words.

Where the contrary is the case, the evidential value of the 'note' is weakened, and such notes are accordingly omitted from the lists to be given. It is not in every case easy to apply this rule, or even to ascertain the facts. Many 'early' notes recur once or twice in the Brahmagas and even in the later literature, especially in the Bhãgavatapurãfla: but I have not excluded them merely on this ground. On the other hand, a word which is in very frequent use in the Brãhmaças is excluded, even though evidence of its use in classical Sanskrit is wanting. Accor- dingly the list of omitted notes (pp. 453 sq.) may appear to some too short, to others too long. But the cases of doubt are not sufficiently numerous to affect the results. A similar difficulty occurs in collecting the groups of forms or words which make up a 'note'. In most cases each 'word' in the list is to be understood as including all com- pounds and derivatives. But the exceptions are numerous, and in many cases appear irrational. I have thought it best to put all the facts forward in this case, leaving their im- portance to be judged in dealing with the separate hymns. I have felt the greatest hesitation in inserting in the list of</page><page sequence="10">438 Edward V. Arnold, 'late' words such verbs as jlv, pac, pad, mri, and vad, which must have been familiar to the poets of the Çigveda, and of which derivatives or cognates are freely used by them. The relative frequency of these verbs in C seems not to be strictly speaking a linguistic fact, but a question of style or subject-matter. But even so, the occurrences may have a value in assisting the collection of homogeneous hymns. Absolute accuracy in the mass of figures given will hardly be expected of me: nevertheless they have been sub- jected to repeated revision. In regard to the Atharvaveda, my investigations have not required any analysis of its contents: for this reason I have not been in a position to apply strictly the rule that repetitions are only reckoned three times, and the numbers given may in consequence be too high. But this can very seldom be the case except where there is an ample margin to satisfy the conditions of the acceptance of a form as 'late'. The general character of the 'grammatical' notes has been already explained in my article in JAOS vol. xviii, which is in the remainder of this article referred to as HVG. For this reason I do not in the present article discuss in detail the groups selected: but such particulars are given in the notes on pp. 454 sq. as will, I hope, avoid misinter- pretation of the short titles which alone can be given in the tables on pp. 440 sq. It is frequently the case that a single word contains two or more notes of 'early' or 'late' date: for instance the vocative adrivaJi contains the 'early' word Mri and the 'early' vocative suffix -vah. As far as possible the groups are so arranged that such words shall only be reckoned once: thus, in the instance named, the occurrences are given under the heading of 'vocative in -váh' and omitted under ádri. To carry out this plan completely would be impracticable, as it would enormously complicate the drawing up of the groups. It may also happen that the same word contains notes both of 'early' and 'late' date: as the word ulukhalasutanaam in i. 28. 1-4, which contains the letter I twice, being a sign of late date, and the genitive plural in -aaw, which is a sign of early date. Such instances are not common, and are due to overlapping of the respective linguistic develop-</page><page sequence="11">The second Mandala of the Rigveda. 439 inents: in the instance named we must conclude that the genitive plural in -aant continued to be occasionally used at the same time that the use of I was becoming more general. In this case the letter I is once reckoned as a note of 'late' date, and the form of -aain as a note of 'early' date: and both are taken into account in assigning a relative date to the hymn in which they occur. In collecting the occurrences I have felt confidence in following the guidance of Whitney, both in his Roots, Verb-Forms, and Primary Derivatives of the Sanskrit Language (which in many points supersedes his Sanskrit Grammar) and in his Index Verborum to the Atharvaveda. For the Çigveda Max Müller's Index is frequently incomplete: Grassmann's Wörterbuch, with the Addenda made after comparison with Max Müller's work, appears within in its own limits to be fairly complete: but it is often avowedly incomplete in the list of many forms important for the present purpose, and it has the curious practice of ignoring the repetition of a form when it recurs in the same stanza. In these points I have done my best to supplement it by frequent comparison with Max Müller's Index. With these explanations I proceed to give the lists of 'early' and 'late' notes which seem to me at present to have real importance. For the convenience of the tables of occur- rences that are to follow, a symbol, such as ao, ce, as well as a number, is attached to each note.</page><page sequence="12">440 Edward V.

Particulars as to the grammatical notes of early date. 1. aa before «: see HVG. § 65. 2. ib. § 63. 3. ib. § 64. 4. ib. § 61. 5. ib. § 66: but omitting mam (maaip) and vám (vadm), which occur in quite late hymns. 6. See HVG. § 69. 7. This note is partly one of vocabulary, as parallel forms like divid remain in use much longer. 8. See HVG. § 107, and add bhrat(a)ráyi, iv. 23. 6. 10. Except mahitvá, tuá (tod) and krctya: the two latter being counted in Nos. 24 and 65 respectively. 11. Except ashfd. 12. See HVG., § 169. The nom. ace. sing, in -a&amp;, -ani are not included: they remain in use much later. The resolved forms, e. g. -aam, -aàh are not included here either, being counted in No. 2 above. The forms gmdfy, jmdjj, are not included, their connexion with this class being doubtful. 13. These adjectival formations are placed here, because they are cog- nate to Note 12. 24.

Notes of date in the second Mandala. ■ ■ Before making a list of the occurrences of these notes in our Mandala, it is necessary to determine which of the hymns are or may be composite in character. This task is comparatively simple. Hymn 3 is of the Äpriya type: and the comparison of vii. 2 and ix. 5 shews that the last four verses may possibly be a separate composition. Hymn 8 has an appended verse (6), which is possibly of the late Anushtubh type, and in which the combination of the gods Agni Indra and Soma is unusual, and suggests late date. Hymn 32 consists of three sections, vv. 1 - 3; 4. 5; and 6 - 8, which differ in their subject matter. Hymn 41 consists of a series of triplets (chiefly in Gãyatri) each of which is in substance a separate hymn. With these exceptions the hymns appear to be homogeneous. The notes are referred to by the symbols given them on pages 440 - 452 : figures above the line, as in z*. denote the number of occurrences in the stanza, if there is more than one.

Although these notes of grammar and vocabulary at once point to the late date of certain hymns of the Mancala, it will be desirable before discussing any such results to exa- mine carefully the indications of metre. I therefore proceed to take note of certain criteria of early and late date re- spectively, premising that these terms are not used merely to correspond to the difference between AB and C, but that their respective importance is to be determined later. These notes fall into two groups according as they refer to the Gayatrï-Anushtubh or to the TrisMubh- Jagati family of metres: capital letters will be used as their symbols. In the table of occurrences the italic letters abed etc. represent the re- spective padas. The lyric metres may be considered as belonging to the Gayatrï-Anushtubh family as regards the octosyllabic verses they contain, and to the Trishtubh-Jagatï family in respect of their 12-syllable verses. 1.

Arnold, value to y v wherever such a measurement will give to a verse the normal number of syllables: the limitations of this option are discussed by me in HVG. §§ 75 to 105. They create a difficulty in ii. 18 . 2d, which I hold nevertheless to be strictly a Trishtubh verse, with long ninth and short tenth syllable. The resolution of a, e, o and u is permissible in certain words and terminations only: the resolution aa I accept in the genitive plural (-aarfl) of all stems, because this supposition gives us the normal number of syllables in many hundreds of verses throughout the Eigveda, and in a great number of hymns in which we have otherwise no sign of irregularity in the metre. The resolution of ã in the in- flexion of root-nouns, e. g. kshaarn, and of root-verbs, e. g. páanti, is equally well established: as also in certain stems with -as suffix, as bhàs (bháaJt) cf. Greek cpéœç. I accept it with much greater hesitation in other cases, as in this Man- cala dyáatfl 11. be 15d, daasám 11.2c, daasásya 20.6d, dáasl}} 20.76, daaçúshali 20.2c, naasatya 41.7. Resolution of n is fairly certain in nú (núu), pur (púur), pñshán and bhüt, bhnta, bhütu, and sura: it is possible, but hardly likely in nutana 20 Ad: very doubtful in çuurá (as ii. 11. 5d, 18a). As will shortly appear, the metre of hymns 11 and 20 cannot be reduced to regularity even by these suppositions. The resolution of r and n presents difficulties: pitrób is doubtless trisyllabic in 17.7, as always in the Çigveda. But it is not so easy to determine whether índra, rudrá, and çúshna are at times trisyllabic. The reading çûshana proposed by Grassmann in 14.5ft gives the right number of syllables to that päda: but there is no other evidence for it in the Çigveda. In hymn 33 the reading rudará restores the right number of syllables in 13 padas of 33, and makes the whole hymn regular: yet it is only suggested in six other passages in the Çigveda. It seems necessary to accept this form on the ground of economy of reasoning, for otherwise we must introduce into the hymn three different types of decasyllabic verse. Even so this optional measurement gives a distinctive, and presumably an early character to the hymn. In 11 we have at first sight no less than 59 decasyllabic padas out of 83. By reading indara for índra we obtain the right number of syllables ten times: by reading dyaam for dyâni</page><page sequence="35">The second Mandala of the Rigveda. 463 twice (5c, Ibd): páanti once (14eZ): daasá once (2c): çúura twice (5d, 18a): ucátha for ukthá twice (2d, 166). In this way then we may explain 18 of the pädas, but 40 will remain : and of these nine out of every ten deviate from the normal Trishtubh by substituting one long syllable for two short after an early caesura. The only possible conclusion is that we have here a metrical experiment, to which the double measurements of certain words have led the way. This is recognised by the tradition in the special title - Virafsthana Trishtubh - given to the metre of this hymn: it has however nothing in common with the Dvipada Viraj of i 65-70 except that it is decasyllabic. But both experiments presumably belong to the early development of Vedic poetry, for they are quite strange to its later history. This pre- sumption we shall soon find to be strongly supported by other indications. Now although the word indra may be reckoned as trisyllabic in some 180 passages in the Çigveda, yet practically all these occurrences are in the same position in the verse as in this hymn : and the restoration of indara and like forms does not free these hymns from decasyllabic padas. It appears to me therefore that the variation belongs prin- cipally to metre, and I have so reckoned all the occurrences of this word. For the same reason the restoration of ucátha becomes unnecessary. The resolutions páanti, dyáam, daasá and cutirá I have admitted rather for the sake of uniformity than because there is any evidence that the author of this hymn intended them. In 16d I read tnota id, not tuá-ntã id, though the latter would give the right number of syllables. Setting aside the decasyllabic pädas in hymn 11, and also those which become regular if indra be reckoned as tri- syllabic, the following are the padas of the same number of syllables found in this Magala, with the measurements which have been suggested for their emendation: 1 Id (Jag.) tuárn päyur „ dame y ás te (á)vidhat (dama à) 2 la yajñéna (t vardhata jatávedasaw (yajanéna) 4 36 priyám dhvih w ksheshyánto ná mitrám (dadhuh) bd jujurvañ n yo mühur à yúva bhút (jujtiruàft) 86 tritiye „ vidáthe mánrna cañsi 9c surtrãso ì{ abhimatishàhah 31*</page><page sequence="36">464 Edward V.

The pada runs: só aryali pushtîr víja iva minati. So too in 43 2c. The metre of 22 (Ashti) appears to be constructed upon the basis of appending 4 syllables at the end of each Jagatï line: and so far is of the same type as the Atyashti group i 129-139. For convenience of analysis I have taken each pair of 4-syllable appendages as constituting an octosyllabic line. The fourth stanza is very hard to analyze: I take therefore no account of the passage as far as kritám: the remainder appears to fall into padas containing the following number of syllables, 12, 4, 12, 4, 8. In 43.2 we have a Jagatï stanza of five pädas. Such irregularities are common in the AV.: but they seem also to occur as an early variation in the Rigveda, and therefore no account is taken of them here. The value of the rhythmical variations of the Trishtubh- Jagatï family is at present entirely unrecognized: nor is it possible to determine their real importance by the study of so small a portion of the Çigveda as the second Magala. But it at least appears from the tables given that the 'deca- syllabic' variations (A to D) and the 'mixed' variations (Ê.L.) are mutually exclusive: and that the former are always asso- ciated with 'early1 grammatical forms and words, the latter with those hymns which belong by the corresponding notes to the later Çigveda. For convenience of reference we may adopt the following definitions: 1. Decasyllabic Trishtubh: the metre of hymns which contain at least three decasyllabic verses, and at least one such verse in every ten padas. The hymns shewing this metre are 4, 11, 19, 20. 2. 'Decasyllabic' Jagatï: the same metre, except that the verses have the Jagatï cadence, and therefore an additional syllable at the end. Hymn 31 shews this metre. 3. Mixed Trishtubh: the metre of Trishtubh hymns which contain the variations K and L at least twice, and at least once in every twenty padas. Hymn 42 is of this type.</page><page sequence="38">466 Edward V. Arnold, 4. Mixed Jagatï: the corresjjonding metre in Jagatï hymns. This metre is more difficult to recognize, because a cata- lectic Jagatï verse is identical in form with a Trishtubh verse, and yet is no indication of late date. But we need not hesitate to recognise this type in hymn 32 vv. 4, 5, and in 43, where such an interpretation is supported by the subject-matter of the hymns, and the contiguity of other late matter. The metrical interpretation of 3 1-7 is more difficult. With regard to the 'iambic' variations E to G, and the 'cretic' variation H, it is at once clear that they overlap to a very considerable extent, and that great caution must therefore be used in drawing conclusions from their appear- ance in any particular hymn. Yet their relative frequency is not without importance. In the five 'decasyllabic' hymns named above the iambic variations are 73 in number, the cretic 11: in the three hymns in 'mixed' metre there is only one iambic variation, but there are five cretic variations. We cannot avoid the conclusion that hymns in which the iambic variations preponderate are generally of earlier date than those in which the contrary is the case: whilst on the other hand the occurrence of only one or two such variations (of whichever kind) is a very slight indication of date, except so far as it is negative evidence that the hymn belongs neither to the very earliest nor to the very latest. The following definitions must therefore be taken rather as indications than as evidence of date: but their importance is greatly increased when they are applied to considerable bodies of verse, which on other grounds may be considered as homogeneous: 1. Iambic Trishtubh or Jagatï: the metre of hymns containing at least four of the variations E, F, G, being at least one in every eight padas: and the variation H not more often than once in every ten padas: and the former at least twice as often as the latter. 2. Cretic Trishtubh or Jagatï: the metre of hymns containing the variations E, F, G, not more than once in every ten padas, and the variation H at least four times,</page><page sequence="39">The second Mandala of the Rigveda. 467 being once at least in every eight padas: and the latter at least twice as often as the former. Hymns in which the iambic and cretic variations are more evenly distributed presumably belong to an intermediate period : but, if the proportions approximate to those just given, an indication to that effect is given in brackets in the follow- ing table. If the whole number of variations is then not greater than one in¿ four, the metre is denoted as regular: this proportion is very greatly exceeded in hymn 17 in this Marídala, and again, very slightly, namely in hymn 35. Hymns 36 and 37 may be presumed to be but one hymn by their title and by their position in the collection: and they are so treated in the following table in the de- scription of metre.

To these we shall refer later by the symbols attached. (i) Arrangement. (ao) Hymns 9 and 10 are of the same length, but out of their order. This agrees with the indication of homo- geneity given by the metre. (ai) Hymns 23 and 24 may each be broken up into two hymns, the last in each case consisting of three stanzas, and of a concluding stanza which is common to both. But the arrangement shews that in each case the two hymns were united before the Mandala was put together. By the linguistic notes 23 appears earlier than 24, but by the metre the con- trary appears the case: we may suppose them contemporary. (a2) Hymns 27, 28, 29 are only in order if we consider them as addressed to the same deities; 27 and 29 appear to be really akin in character, but not 28, which is addressed to Varuna only. Taking 27 and 29 together, we find a distinct iambic rhythm. (as) The fragments 32 4, 5 and 32 6-8 are out of their order. This is clearly due to their being appendages to the original collection. («4) The hymns 33 to 35 are alike in length: the lan- guage of 33 indicates later date, its metrical form earlier date than for the two following hymns: so that on the whole they need not be separated. («ó) Hymns 39 and 40, though late in character, are not out of their order. The cretic rhythm is well marked in 40, except for the shortness of the hymn. (ae) Hymns 41 7-9, 10-12, 42 and 43 are out of their order. The two last have always been recognized as late additions. (ii) Subject-matter. (/ft) The book is characterized by the four hymns ad- dressed to Brahmanaspati, all of them in the Jagatï metre, to which they thereby give a preponderance. No other collec- tion gives the same relative importance to this deity. It seems therefore likely that the four hymns belong to the same time.</page><page sequence="42">470 Edward V. Arnold, (/fc) The two hymns to the Ädityas also represent a type not very common in the Rigveda. (/?;») The combination of Soma with another deity seems always to be a sign of relatively late date in the Çigveda, and thus confirms other indications as to hymn 40. (/»*) The subject-matter of 32 4, 5 ; 6-8 : 42 : 43 confirms the other indications of their late date, (iii) Refrains. (yi) Hymn 12 has to each stanza (except the last) the refrain sá janasa îndrah. Hymn 13 has from verse 2 to verse 4 the refrain yás tákrinoh prathamáw sásy ukthyàfy. Although this refrain is not carried throughout the hymn, every stanza contains at least the three last words, except the first, in which it is slightly varied, and the last, which is common to hymn 14. These two refrains are alike in filling a half-pãda only, and in commencing with the word sá: they connect closely these two hymns, and confirm the attribution of a cretic rhythm to the latter. In hymn 14 each stanza, except the last, begins with the address ádlwaryavah, and has thus something in its tone which connects it with the two preceding hymns. (y¿) Hymn 15 has in stanzas 2-9 the refrain somásya ta rnáda índraç cakara Hymn 22 has in stanzas 1-3 the refrain saînaw saçcad devo devam satyám índrarfi satyá índulj. Hymn 25 has the refrain yaw-yaw yújaw kriy&gt;uté hráhmanas pátih. Hymn 37 has the refrain [hotrâd] somam dravinodal.i piba ntúbhih. The refrains in hymns 25, 37 seem to dissociate them from 26 and 36 respectively, with which nevertheless it seems imperative on other grounds to connect them. On the whole the refrains of this group seem to have no importance as an indication of date. (iv) Concluding stanzas and padas, (íi) The most common concluding stanza is that beginning nünmyi sá te</page><page sequence="43">The second Mancala of the Big ved a. 471 which is found in the Indra hymns 1 1 , and 15 to 20. Two of its four padas shew iambic variation , and it is therefore presumably an old verse. It is not found in the cretic hymns 12-14, nor in hymn 21 which has a different final stanza, also in Trishtubh metre. The stanza seems distinctly a con- necting link between the hymns which employ it, and an indication of early date. (A) The concluding half-stanza beginning víçvaw tád is found in hymns 23, 24, and 35: in the first two cases preceeded by the half-stanza beginning bráhmanas pate It forms a connecting link between the three hymns. (¿3) A concluding stanza beginning asmábhyarfi tád is found in 13, 14 and 38: but in the last hymn it differs after these opening words. As the cretic variations are also the more numerous in 38, this may indicate later date. (¿4) The concluding stanza yé stotríbhyah . . . connects hymns 1 and 2. We need therefore pay less atten- tion to the somewhat iambic character of hymn 1. (dò) The concluding stanza máhám maghónah connects 27, 28 and 29: but it is clear from its meaning that it is really appropriate only to hymn 28. (Je) All these stanzas (except asmabhyarn tad in hymn 38) include the final päda, also found in hymns 12 (slightly varied), 33, 39, 40, 42, 43 bfihád vadema vidáthe suvtrâb. This pada is however wanting in the following hymns: 3 (Apra), 4, 9, 10 (Agni), 21, 22 (Indra), 25, 26 (Brähmai&gt;as- pati), 30, 31, 32 (the first two sections), 34, 36, 37, 38. It is therefore found in 17 hymns, including some of the earliest and some of the latest hymns, and it is wanting in 15. Its absence is perhaps a slight connecting link be- tween hymns 9 and 10; 25 and 26; 30, 31 and 32 1-3; and 36, 37 respectively. It does not, however, seem possible to group together 30, 31 and 32 1-3, on other grounds.</page><page sequence="44">472 Edward V. Arnold, (v) Style and language. (*i) The authors of the hymns name themselves as Gritsa- madas in hymns 4, 19, and 39; as Çunahotras in 18 and 41 13-15, and as both in 41 16-18. Five of these six hymns are marked out by the metre as early. («) Five of the hymns are described as 'new', viz 11 (verse 16), 17 (verse 1), 18 (verses 1 and 3) 20 (verse 4) and 31 (verse 7). All of these hymns except 17 are clearly marked by the metre as relatively early: nor is there any reason why the earliest writers should not so have described their poems, seeing that they too had predecessors whose productions have not been preserved to us. With this indi- cation we need not hesitate to class 17 with the group 18-20; it contains two decasyllabic and seven iambic variations in 32 padas, which in themselves give it the character of an iambic hymn: and we must attribute to accident the fact that it contains so many as five cretic verses, one of which however (òd) may be interpreted otherwise. («) An enumeration of the priestly offices of hotrcim, potrám etc. occurs in hymns 1, 5, 36 and 37, and connects them. Hymns 1, 36 and 37 are already associated by metre: hymn 5 is the only pure Anushtubh hymn in the Mandala: it has no other sign of later date than the majority of hymns in that metre. (sa) Hymns 25 and 26 are connected by the expression vanavad vamishyatáh, which gives a further reason for disre- garding the slight cretic tendency shewn by hymn 25. (fö) Hymns 11, 15 and 22 are connected by the technical term trikadrnhaJi, which therefore cannot possibly be an indi- cation of late date. (¿e) Hymn 12, as Professor Weber notes, contains a fairly distinct reference to the beginnings of the caste-system by its mention of the subjugation of the dása várna (v. 4) : whereas the earlier hymns of 11, 20 speak of a period of conflict. The joint result of these indications of so many kinds is that we are led to group the hymns of this Mandala in rough order of time, as follows:</page><page sequence="45">The second Mancala of the Rigveda. 473 Chronological Groups of the second Mandala.

It is clear, at a glance that in no point is the Magala homo- geneous: it contains in miniature all the variations which the whole Çigveda shews on a larger scale. But whilst the evidence for some parts of the picture is clear and cumulative, in other parts it is weak and even contradictory. The hymns as to the position of which my doubts are particularly strong I have marked with a note of interrogation. Upon what results can reliance be placed, and what conclusions of importance can be drawn from them? I. There is cumulative evidence for the very early date of the five hymns 4, 11, 19, 20 and 31, which, in addition to their striking peculiarity of metre, have only one half the proportion of late forms which the Çigveda proper shews. Thus Professor Weber's theory, that hymn 11 is a collection of fragments, falls to the ground, unless we are to suppose that the fragments belong to a pre-Vedic period. Of these five hymns three are addressed to Indra, and this is in harmony with the fact so strongly marked in Magala viii also, that the national Indra-worship dominates the earliest poetry of the Veda. n. There is cumulative evidence that the hymns 3, 12, 13, 14 and 30 belong to the latest period of the Çigveda proper; of these five hymns also three are addressed to Indra, so that the worship of Indra may be considered still to be dominant. In hymns 12 and 13 in particular we have something like a proclamation of the honour of this god to a listening people. III. The groups marked A2, Bi, B2 are only roughly distinguished one from another by their metre (for in A2 we have chiefly Gâyatrï, which is of all the metres the least distinctive), and they are not satisfactorily distinguished by the proportion of late linguistic forms. Taking them together, they form about two-thirds of the Magala, and possess certain features which may be said in consequence to cha- racterize the hymns of the Gjitsamada family. These fea- tures are:</page><page sequence="48">476 Edward V. Arnold, (a) the prevalence of the Jagatï metre, in which 12 hymns are written1) as compared with 10 in Trishtubh. The other sections of the Çigveda in which the Jagatï metre is prevalent are the groups i 31-35, 51-57, 140-164, and ix 68-97. (b) the important position occupied by the god Bjihaspati, who is more frequently addressed by the title Brahmanaspati here than in the other parts of the Çigveda; and the recog- nition, wanting in many or all of the collections, of such deities as Varu$a and Savitar (apart from the general group of the Ãdityãh), Rudra and Apãiji Napãt. (c) Except in group A2, a distinctly though not largely greater use of later linguistic forms than is found in the Çigveda generally. As regards date, these indications all appear to me to place this collection among the latest, if it is not on the whole actually the latest of the family collections: but this point cannot be thoroughly discussed unless the material of the Çigveda as a whole is before as. Meanwhile Professor Weber has made the interesting suggestion that these hymns mark a temporary reaction from the worship of Indra in favour of Brahmanaspati or other deities, which was followed later by a revival of Indra-worship. I quote the passages in which this view is put forward by Professor Weber in the article already referred to: (a) p. 2 and note. "Die grosse bevorzugung des Brah- maijaspati, des herrn des gebetes, welchem ebenso wie dem weiterhin an seine stelle tretenden Brihaspati, die th^ten des Indra, die er mittels des brahman, statt des vajra, verrichtet, zugeschrieben werden, gehört nur diesem Magala an. Es ist dies der anfang jener bewegung, welche schliesslich zu dem ausschluss des Indra vom Soma- trunk, sowie überhaupt zur Unterwerfung des kshatrarp unter das brahman geführt hat". (b) p. 3. uEs scheint ferner die herstellung des zweiten Mandala mit einer gegen Indra gerichteten feindseligkeit in Verbindung gebracht werden zu sollen, resp. als ein eintreten ür Indra aufgefasst werden zu müssen". !) counting 36, 37 as one hymn.</page><page sequence="49">The second Mandala of the Rigveda. 477 (c) p. 4. "Für die gegen Indra gerichtete feindseligkeit sodann legt das 12. lied unmittelbares zeugniss ab, welches lied ja gerade eben gegen solche feindseligkeit gerichtet ist. Auch die an Brahmaçaspati gerichteten lieder (23-26) sind in der gleichen richtung aufzufassen. Das Magala erscheint resp. hiernach als zu einer zeit abgefasst, in welcher zwar der Indradienst noch beim volke in vollem ansehen stand, aber in den priesterlichen kreisen doch bereits schwere an- fechtung zu bestehen hatte.44 As a test of these suppositions Professor Weber appeals to statistical investigations. The answer is by no means unfavourable to a modified form of his contention. For my results go to shew that of the 13 hymns in this Magala, which are addressed to Indra, 3 belong to a very early, and 3 to a late period of the Çigveda proper, and one to the late Çigveda: leaving in the body of the collection only six hymns out of thirty-five addressed to this deity, which is a rather small proportion. If the proposed division of the groups A2 Bi B2 could be trusted, then in the latter we should only find one Indra hymn in sixteen. This divi- sion however is not adequately substantiated. But at any rate in the three groups together the Indra hymns shew 27 iambic variations to 11 cretic, whilst the other hymns shew only 79 iambic variations to 67 cretic, so that according to the metrical indications at least the Indra hymns belong mainly to the earlier part of this period. I am unable to find here any trace of hostility to the worship of Indra: the bards of the family may have consi- dered that they were already in possession of a sufficient number of hymns addressed to this deity. But there is at least a lack of enthusiasm in favour of this god : the creative instincts of the bards have sought another outlet. As to its nature Professor Weber makes suggestions: (a) p. 8. aDie Verbindung des namens narãçaúsa mit dem zendischen nairyõçaúha liegt doch so nahe, dass man dadurch unwillkürlich zu denjenigen momenten geführt wird, welche für unser Maçdala eine directe beziehung zu den nordwestlichen, iranischen nachbarn und geschlechtsgenossen der nach Indien einwandernden Arier zu indiciren scheinen. u Zeitaobrift für Tergi.

"Endlich verweise ich noch auf das schöne lied (38) an Savitar, wohl das schönste seiner art in der Ílik-Saiphitã, in welchem der zur zeit der bildung des vedi- schen rituals an den namen des Savitar angeknüpfte, specu- lativ monotheistische zug der vorher an Varuna (Ahura bei den Iraniern) später an Prajäpati (Brahman) anschliesst, zum vollen ausdruck gelangt ist und zwar so, dass er dabei in vers 2 in gestalt eines seine hände segnend über die seinigen ausstreckenden gottes vorgeführt wird, ein bild, das Indien sonst ganz fremd ist, aber unwillkürlich an das gleiche vorgehen eines die gemeinde segnenden priesters bei einem semitischen oder iranischen gottesdienst erinnert." I pass by those suggestions of Professor Weber which suggest a direct connexion, either of place or of time, between the writers of our hymns and the poets of the Avesta: the geographical suggestions because they are too vague, the chronological because they are generally in conflict with the evidence which suggests a somewhat late date for this Man- cala as a whole. For the main argument these suggestions are unnecessary, because a speculative tendency, which could ultimately find its expression in much later times in the worship of Prajäpati or Brahman, could a fortiori display itself in any period of the Çigveda proper. I must also take exception to the reference to an early worship of Varuna. The earliest Vedic hymns always associate this deity with Mitra and Aryaman, or at least with the former: those in which he is addressed separately appear to be quite as late as the hymn in this book to Savitar. With these qualifications I think Professor Weber's theory holds good. The poets of the main part of this Mandala hold themselves to a great extent aloof from the worship of the national Indian god Indra: and they give voice to priestly tradition and priestly speculation, which on the whole is unfavourable to the ambitions of the royal caste. This priestly tradition to a large extent revives Indo-Iranian phrases and habits of thought, as is shewn by the comparatively numerous hymns addressed to the Ãdityãhi as a body or to their chief representatives Mitra and Varuna, and by the revival of the Indo-Iranian titles nárãçáúsa and apárfi nápãt, both of which are from this time on more or less definitely associated with</page><page sequence="51">The second Mancala of the Riveda. 479 the god Agni. But to the old tradition new elements are added. Amongst these I reckon as of first importance the monotheistic tendency, of which I can only recognize the germ in the Indo-Iranian period, for the equations Varujia = Ahura, and Mitra- Varaga = Ahura-Mithra seem to me without foun- dation. But the same impulse, which after the parting of the nations led the Iranians in the time of the Zend-Avesta to cast their religion into a distinctly monotheistic shape in the worship of Ahura Mazda (which shape was afterwards partially abandoned owing to the growth of Mithra worship), seems to me to have led the Indian poets to a series of attempts to establish one deity in the supreme place. The name chosen might be in turn Savitar, Varuna, Brahmaiias- pati, or Brahman: but it was at least always one of those deities whose names suggest a spiritual power, representative of law and order rather than of war and conquest, and therefore not markedly personal and anthropomorphic. Never however has such a type of religion established itself in India beyond the circle of the educated and contemplative: kings and peasants alike have demanded a more concrete ideal. How far the conflict of the same tendencies has tended to mould the existing religious worships of Europe it would be beyond the scope of this paper to discuss: but at least the analogies are sufficiently close to enable us to reject Goethe's dictum "die indische lehre taugte von haus aus nichts" as inapplicable to the spirit which breathes in the Çigveda and in the strain of Indian thought of which the Çigveda shews us the beginnings. I have already said that this paper is intended rather as a programme and experiment for the historical treatment of the whole Çigveda, than as being in any way complete in itself. I now propose to deal with the objection raised in many quarters to investigations which have ultimately a statistical basis, namely that the items of the evidence vary greatly in value, and that they therefore 'need to be weighed as well as counted'. The process of 'weighing' is necessa- rily of a very subjective character, as may be seen at once from the great difference in value which different writers attribute to indications of date: it is therefore well to notice that it is superfluous when the number of the indications 32*</page><page sequence="52">480 Edward V. Arnold, is large or the proportion in a particular direction over- whelming. Thus it is unnecessary to 'weigh' the evidence that ii. 11 is an early hymn, and ii. 43 late: for even if one-half of the evidence were thought to be of little impor- tance, the remaining half would be sufficient to establish the same result. Nor again would it be of use to 'weigh' the evidence which goes to shew that this Maculala is on the whole of rather later date than the Çigveda proper as a whole: for that evidence depends upon the comparison of a very large number of particulars in each case, and a veri- fication or evaluation of each would leave the general result unaltered. If any doubt is entertained on this last point, it will not be by those who have any experience of sta- tistical investigation. But where one or two hymns only are concerned, and the evidence is more or less evenly balanced, the quality of the evidence is undoubtedly of importance. I propose therefore to give in detail the evidence for each hymn in this Mancala in which this is the case: my estimate of its value will naturally be open to criticism in the widest sense. The hymns, then, as to the position of which there can be serious doubt, seem to me to be those which are discussed in the remainder of this article. 3. Apra hymn. Metre, cretic Trishtubh, strongly marked, one päda in every five being of this type: with a hyper- syllabic päda in the third stanza, and three such in the sixth, unless we reckon this as a Jagatï stanza with one catalectic verse. Early forms: v. 3. imperative ydkshi' v. 7 loc. nâbha before consonant; v. 9. instrum. çru$hti' v. 11 imperative vakshi. Early words: v. 1. pavakáJi; v. 6. ápãnsi; v. 7. sánushu. Late words: v. 5. áyana; v. 6. páyasvatl. This hymn stands on the border line between the Çig- veda proper and the late Çigveda. Several of the hymns of the Apra type appear to consist of an older part (vv. 1-7) and a later (vv. 8-11): but in this case the indications of later date are more numerous in the earlier section. The term náracáñsa in v. 2 is a connecting link with the Zend- Avesta on the one side, but with the Brãhmajias on the other: it is therefore no criterion of date. None of the forms</page><page sequence="53">The second Mandala of the ßigveda. 481 and words quoted are very decisive of date : but the extreme- ly limited number of linguistic indications of any kind is remarkable, and indicates a middle date. It is impossible to discuss this hymn to advantage except in connexion with the other Apra and Ãpriya hymns: but generally it appears that the type of hymn is old, but the separate verses were adapted from time to time to the ritual in actual use. 5. Agni. Metre, early Anushtubh. There is no reason except the similarity of subject to hymn 1 to cause us to assign this hymn to any date but the earliest. Agni is addres- sed by the titles of the priestly offices hótar, potar, [anu- vaktár], praçastár, neshtár, adhvaryú, and fitvíj in succession, giving us the number of seven priests taking part in the sacrifice. In this case it seems to me that the subject-matter is of more importance than the slight evidence of metre: for although the Anushtubh is rare in the middle Çigveda, we can hardly suppose that it ever went entirely out of use. 8, 6. Agni, Indra, Soma. Metre, either Grayatrï with extra pada or late Anushtubh. Early word: utibhiij,. The combination of deities is unusual, but we can hardly say impossible, in the Çigveda proper: it is common in the Brãhmanas. The form utibhih occurs in the late Çigveda in iii. 53.21 only, and once only in the AV.: in the ÇV. proper it is common. The balance of evidence seems to me in favour of early date. 9 and 10. Indra. These hymns are out of order according to the usual rule, by which they should follow hymn 5. No explanation has been suggested: the hymns themselves are certainly not of late date. 12. Indra. Metre, cretic Trishtubh, with a hypersyllabic ("hybrid" verse) in stanza 5. Early forms: v. 4 aryah' v. 5. aryáh, víjali (monosyllabic stem); v. 14 ütí.

Of these the last is of no importance, as it occurs in what is only a slight variation of the usual con- cluding pada of the Magala, which is also found in i. 117.25, and viii. 48.14.</page><page sequence="54">482 Edward V. Arnold, In my investigation in KZ. xxxiv I found reason to reckon this hymn with the later Jfrgveda. This suggestion I now withdraw: even if the evidence for late date were stronger, I do not think it would be possible to separate the hymn from the two that follow. 15. Indra. Metre: regular Trishtubh, with one deca- syllabic pada (7a). Early forms: v. 1. mahâni, and the following unaugmented past tenses; verse 2, dharayat, paprá- that; v. 7 sthat' v. 8 bhinát, rinák. Early word: v. 5 and v. 9 dht'tnirfl. Late forms: v. 5 sá with hiatus before tip; v. 6 údañcarfl. Late words: v. 4 sám asrijat, v. 9 svápnena. The number of late forms and words in a hymn which on other grounds seems to be distinctly early in type is remarkable. But sá with hiatus only indicates late date so far as it suggests the later form sáh, produced by assi- milation to the -a declension: in the earliest times sá like any other word ending in a (e. g. no) would be freely used with hiatus. The words udac, sam srij, and svápna, though all such as characterize the Atharvaveda by their greater frequency, are, as a reference to the table will shew, used with fair frequency in the Çigveda proper. In this case the linguistic evidence seems not to be of great importance. 28. Varuna: Metre, regular Trishtubh, but with a hyper- syllabic (hybrid) verse (6a). Early forms: ná 'as' in verses 2, 4, 8; v. 4 sim; v. 5 khâm (monosyllabic stem); v. 8 tué (v vocalic). Early words: v. 1 mandrá; v. 2 gómatlnam; v. 4 párijman; v. 8 tuvijata. Late form: mã with aorist passive injunctive twice in verse 5. Late words: v. 2 upáyana, v. 5 chedi, çãri. v. 10 svápne. The position of this hymn is specially interesting, because it is one of the few addressed to Varuija singly. I do not hesitate to assign it to the Çigveda proper, because it seems impossible to separate it from the hymns which precede and follow : but the number of late linguistic notes is remarkable. That four of the six are found in a single half-stanza má tántuç chedi váyato dhíyam me má mátra çary apásah pura xiloli reminds us how strange to the bulk of the Çigveda such appeals for personal preservation are. The only parallel to</page><page sequence="55">The second Mandala of the Rigveda. 483 this hymn that I know in the Çigveda proper is vii. 89: for i. 24 6-15 distinctly belongs to the later Çigveda. But the early date of this hymn seems vouched for by the form khâryi in v. 5, which (as Professor Weber points out) recalls the Avestan ashahe khao (Yaçna x. 4), whereas the word has adapted itself in the Çigveda generally and in the Atharva- veda to the -a declension: and by the resolution of v in tve, which seems never to be found in the late Çigveda or Atharvaveda. 33.

Late words: v. 1 prajábhih ; forms of bheshajá in w. 2, 4, 7, 12, and 13; v. 9 áügaib; v. 10 vicvárüpa. In this hymn the linguistic indications are in opposition to the metrical; for, though the hymn finds a place in the Çigveda proper on both grounds, yet within this range the linguistic indications decidedly favour a rather late date, the metrical indications an early date. The early linguistic indications are 25, and are of 21 different types. Amongst them the stem yuyo-&gt; the compound tvâdatta, the stem hávlmany the subjunctive form griyixshe, the imperative bodhi and the words sumná, tánaya, and maghávan are all very strong evidence of early date, and their cumulative weight is great. The late indications are 13, or more than half as many; but they are of 8 different types only, since the word bheshajá is counted not less than five times. Neither this word nor jalasha is very strong evidence of date; both are found with fair frequency in the Çigveda proper; and though the latter contains I which is in itself a sign of late date, y$t this I seems to be Indo- European, and the sh after a is contrary to the later rules of euphony. But on the other hand kalmalikin with its two i's is a quite typical Atharvavedic word, whilst the double</page><page sequence="56">484 Edward V. Arnold, occurrence of a particle so rare in the Çigveda proper as vai can hardly be explained away. And perhaps the strangest feature in the hymn is that the words tánaya and prajâ, the 'hieratic' and 'popular' expressions for the same idea, occur in it side by side. Thus the difficulties connected with this Rudra hymn cannot be got over by 'weighing' the criteria. Neither will the hypothesis of a 'transition' period be satisfactory, for in such period 'early' and 'late' notes alike should be rare. Again the number and variety of the 'early' forms is in- consistent with the supposition that a late writer has sprink- led his verse with archaisms. Nor is the hymn a patchwork of old and late material: for it has a uniform metrical rhythm, and the early and late notes are thoroughly mingled. I am therefore obliged to resort to the hypothesis of Professor Bloomfield, and to assume that the 'hieratic' and 'popular' dialects were to some extent contemporaneous. I do not see any reason to question the supposition that the 'hieratic' is the older and indeed the mother dialect, and the 'popular' its successor. But it seems to me possible enough that its life was artificially prolonged in the circle of the court and the priests : and that in the period which I indicate by the letter B many of the 'popular' forms and words were in common use in other circles and on other occasions. Now Rudra is distinctly a 'popular' deity: and in this way we may perhaps account for the fact that in a hymn addressed to him a certain number of 'popular' expressions are allowed place. This supposition does not destroy the historical se- quence of the hymns, but it does greatly diminish the neces- sary interval of time between the earlier and later hymns, and it helps to explain how so precise a metrical form as the cretic Trishtubh bridges the gap, in all other points so wide, between the Çigveda proper and the late Çigveda. 39.

These two hymns are test-hymns for the value of the linguistic method in distinguishing the Cigveda proper and the late Çigveda. For according to this method there is clear and sufficient evidence of late date in both hymns: yet in 39 there is no single point so clear as to strike the ordinary reader, an4 in 40 the evidence rests on a single form, which rarely but still sometimes is found in the Çigveda proper. Yet the theory of late date is not unconfirmed: the cretic variations are to the iambic as 10 to 1: and the tho- rough replacement of the 'hieratic' ná 'as' in 39 by the later iva is significant, even apart from the peculiar Sandhi value of iva which Bollensen first pointed out. That hymn 39 is quite different in character from the typical Çigvedic hymn to the Açvins has often been pointed out. 41 10-12. Indra. Metre, Gayatrï. Old word: w. 10, 12 vicarshanilh Late forms: v. 11 paçcât; v. 12 sárvabhyab. Late word: v. 12 áçabhyàl}. I In so short a hymn, and in so colourless a metre as the Gâyatrï, it is very difficult to assign date confidently. Yet there is no term in the Çigveda which is so sure a mark of late date as sárva 'all', and no turn of thought is so characteristic of the later poetry as the reference to 'all quarters of the heaven'. In the Çigveda sárva âçah recurs once, in x 17.5, admittedly one of the latest hymns of the Çigveda. Further, an Indra hymn is entirely out of its order in this part of the Mancala, a point which has very generally been overlooked. I think therefore we need not hesitate to ascribe this hymn to the later Cigveda. Here I conclude my study of this part of the Çigveda. I cannot hope that my results will approve themselves to those who have not had occasion to make themselves ac- quainted with the value of cumulative evidence: and it is sufficiently natural that students of obscure and remote periods of literature should be unfamiliar with such methods. I would simply remind those who see quickly that in such an enquiry the separate arguments are weak, that though a chain is no stronger than its weakest link, yet a cord is a great deal stouter than its slightest strand. Those who</page><page sequence="58">486 W.
