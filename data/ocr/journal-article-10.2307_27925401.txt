<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Alleged 'Demythologization and Secularization5 in Deuteronomy (REVIEW ARTICLE) J. MILGROM University of California, Berkeley It is a privilege to review Moshe Weinfeld's Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomio School,1 a major contribution in its field. The book's main ideas have been made well known through the author's many articles of the past fifteen years. The present work, however, is more than a synthesis of previous research ; it carries the inquiry into un chartered terrain. The book is divided into three parts. The first (pp. 10-178) deals with the typology of the speech form in Deuteronomy (D) and in the deuteronomic editing of the former prophets and Jeremiah, the affinities of this literature to ancient Near Eastern treaty forms and phraseology, and the role of the scribe in its development. Following a pre face in which the and D documents are compared (pp. 179-189) are the second part on the ideology of D (pp. 191-243) and the third (pp. 244-319), which details the im pact of wisdom literature upon the development of the deuteronomic texts. Com pleting the book are two appendices, the first listing and annotating the deuteronomic phraseology (pp. 320-365) and the second briefly comparing Hosea and D (pp. 366 370), and indices under the rubrics of bibliography, glossaries, sources, scriptural references and subject matter (pp. 371-467). Part is clearly the author's main contribution. It reveals a thorough knowledge of the numerous publications in this field and in related ancient Near Eastern texts. The presentation is lucid, the analysis careful, and the original insights abundant. Weinfeld is remarkably able to see the relevant relationships in every source that he consults. The result is a convincing case that Deuteronomy is not structured out of Levitic orations whose Sitz im Leben is a cultic ceremony (von Rad) but is a fusion of two treaty forms : a law covenant and a vassalship covenant, the latter based on first mil lennium state treaties whose adaptation was carried out by a circle of scribes. In Part m (a synthesis of previously published work) these scribes are identified with the wisdom tradition. Weinfeld convincingly demonstrates that the deuteronomic literature is informed by wisdom idioms and ideas.

The title of the section 'Demythologization and Secularization' will serve as the focus of the reviewer's reservations. 'Demythologization' is too strong a term and the evidence adduced as a foil, mainly from P, is not rendered correctly and borders at times on the inaccurate. A few exam ples will suffice. It is not true that 'in expiation is effective only through ritual sacri fices and incense burning, which are not accompanied by confession or prayer on the part of the penitent' (p. 211). To the contrary, P's expiatory system expressly requires confession as a prerequisite whenever a deliberate wrong is committed (mmm, Lev. 5:1-5; Num. 5:5-7). Otherwise sacrificial expiation is only for inadvertant wrongs where regret is inherent.2 It is equally untrue (1) that P's tithe is inherently sacred (p. 215)3 ; (2) that P's sacred gifts 'have a fixed composition compared with the voluntary gifts of D' (p. 221);4 (3) and that D 'deliberately ignored it (suet) because it did not accord with his own religious frame of mind' (p. 213).5 According to Weinfeld, D is free of P's notions that impurity is a miasmic, palpable substance (pp. 225-6) because in bloodshed contaminates the land (Num. 35:33-34) whereas in D it falls upon the people (19:10 ; 21:8). This distinction is illusory : P's concept of the contamination of the land also informs D. Remarriage with a divorced woman who meanwhile has been contaminated (nK?ttn) by another man is forbidden 'that you may not bring sin (ir&amp;nn) upon the land' (24:4). The exact meaning of Kn#m is clarified by Jer. 3:1, a passage influenced by D, which employs the synonym *pnn 'pollute' (see Num. 35:33). Moreover, the rationale for not exposing the corpse of an executed criminal overnight is: kVi 'you shall not contaminate the land' (21:23). Lest one think that D speaks in metaphors, note that the deuteronomist applies this prohibition to non-Israelite residents (so Josh. 8:29 ; 10:27) ? precisely as does in its laws involving the contamination of the land (e.g. bloodguilt, Num. 35:15) ? even though D insists throughout that religious laws are incumbent upon Israelites alone (e.g. eating carcasses, 14:21). In the case of the unsolved murder (pp. 210-211), it is true that expiation is sought for the people and not the land (21:8), but the ceremonial of the broken-necked heifer is incomprehensible without the assump tion that blood does contaminate the land on which it is spilt and that this ritual trans fers the contamination to untillable land6. Indeed, since these three cases where D predicates the contamination of the land are nowhere to be found in P, the reverse case could be made that P's 'magical' prescriptions have been expanded in D ! 2 J. Milgrom : The Cultic Seg?g? and its Influence in Psalms and Job, JQR 58 (1967-8), pp. 115-125. 3 The Levitical portion (Num. 18:21 ff.) is never called 'holy'. 4 D does not abolish compulsory gifts (18:1) and actually encourages giving in excess of the Law (Le v. 23:38 ; Num. 6:21 ; 29:39). 5 According to the suet of game animals may be eaten since it is ineligible for the altar (the pro hibition of Lev. 7:23 refers only to sacrificial animals; note v. 25). D does not contradict but, on the contrary, is its logical and necessary extension, for in allowing profane slaughter, it endows all permitted animals with the status of game. 6 See Encyclopaedia Judaica, s.v. Ariifa'.</page><page sequence="3">158 J. MILGROM Even where D and are distinguished correctly, imbalance has not been avoided. For example, it cannot be denied that D's DtP theology in contrast to P's ? shows a rejection of anthropomorphism and corporealism (pp. 202-204), but is P's concept as static (even more static than JE) as Weinfeld would have us believe? The error consists in misunderstanding P's terminology7 and in not realizing that has transformed more ancient usage into a sophisticated system of its own. Thus P's very notion of tdd and the indwelling God is the vehicle by which it expresses its doctrine of collective responsibility8 ? a doctrine that is suffused with an ethical sensitivity that does not fall short of anything found in D. Weinfeld asseverates that 'in Priestly circles these (early) anthropomorphic features underwent schematization and dogma tization' (pp. 192-3); more accurately, they underwent reinterpretation and abstrac tion. The distortion of is especially evident in the chapter on holiness (pp. 225-232). P's 'you shall be holy' is taken to mean that 'your holiness is dependent upon your observance of the principles of ritual purity' (p. 228). However, the holiness command also stands at the head of Lev. 19, a chapter with a sublime ethical content. In truth, a case for the reverse judgment can be made : it is D and not that makes holiness coextensive with ritual commands (cf. Deut. 7:5-6; 14:1-2, 21)! D's doctrine of holiness can also be scored because it predicates that all of Israel is automatically holy, in contrast to where holiness is a goal which can only be reached by constant ritual and ethical refinement (note who is dynamic and static here). A polemical note in D against is alleged because 'the rationale of a 'holy people' appears particularly in a context that deals with self-mutilation and the eating of nebelah (Deut. 14:1-2 and 21), transgressions which and stress in connection with the priests' (p. 227). In regard to nebelah, however, only distinguishes between priest and layman as to penalties : the layman needs undergo purification (Lev. 11:39-40) but the priest is liable to death by God (Lev. 22:9). Since D is silent concerning sanctions, who is to say that it rules differently (an ex silentio argument, see below). As for self-mutilation, Weinfeld's alleged distinction between layman and priest in is chimerical ; compare Lev. 19:28 with 21:5. Thus, the mythologization of D exists only if D's premises are ignored and P's are misconstrued. As 'Mythologization' is a misrendering of P, so 'Secularization' is a misrendering of D. D's 'Secular Trends' (pp. 233-43) are adduced under four main points : (1) The judiciary. The conclusion is reached that 'appointment of secular magis trates over matters which formerly lay with sacral jurisdiction implies, therefore, that the Israelite judiciary had undergone a process of secularization' (p. 236). Two laws are cited as evidence : piercing the ear of a slave who refuses manumission (15:17, cf. 7 E.g. anp means 'encroach' not 'approach', p. 192; cf. my Studies in Levitical Terminology, Berkeley, 1970, pp. 16-20. ?

All other evidence is deduced ex silentio. To begin with, it can be demonstrated that D grants the priest more powers ? not fewer ? than any other code. Whereas in the operation of the priest is confined to the sanctuary, in D he functions outside the sacred sphere. His responsibility in main taining the morale of the army has prophetic overtones (20:1-4; cf. 1:29; 31:6; 2 Chron. 20:15-17, etc.). As for the unsolved murder (21:1-9), it is true that the priests perform no ritual, but only because the breaking of the heifer's neck is not a sacrifice. The presence of the priests is necessary because D expressly demands it in the adjudica tion of all criminal cases (ibid., v. 5). In fact, it is the new judicial status that D bestows on the priest that constitutes one of its far-reaching innovations. The priest is to sit on the high court in every appealed case of homicide, civil law or assault (17:8; cf. Ezek. 44:24). Moreover as a state official, he is supported by the police power of the state (17:12) ? carrying his authority far beyond the sacred realm. The latter, how ever, remains undiminished ; there is no textual warrant for the claim (p. 230) that 'the central judiciary also dispensed with the sacral media of jurisdiction (lot-oracle, ordeal)'. Indeed, how else is one to explain Hilkiah's fervent advocacy (and initiation) of the deuteronomic reform (2 Kings 22:8-10; 23:24) ? a question that Weinfeld re gretfully fails to ask. Would a High Priest have agreed to a 'process of secularization'? Granted that the priesthood lost some duties and revenues (because of centralization, not secularization), it was more than compensated by the extensive powers it acquired in D's reorganization of the judiciary. (2) The cities of refuge. Weinfeld deduces their secularization from the premise that they were originally temple cities. This premise, however, is unfounded and it betrays a misreading of P. For how could legislate that half the cities (3) be located east of the Jordan (Num. 35:14) if they had to contain sanctuaries? Trans-Jordan is for 'impure' (Josh. 22:19), the mere erection of an altar there an act of treason (ibid., ). It is no accident that in Joshua uses ]na for the dedication of the Trans-Jordan refuges in contrast to tPIp for the Cisjordanian ones (Josh. 20:7-8). The absence of sanctuaries in the cities of refuge is thus a presupposition of and it leads to the corol lary deduction that P's high priest (Num. 35:28) stems neither from the city of refuge (p. 236, n. 6) nor from the manslayer's city9 but from the one authorized sanctuary.10 In Weinfeld's attempt to secularize D's asylum, he further conjectures that the ac cidental manslayer resides in the city of refuge not until the death of the high priest (Num. 35:28), but 'until the rage of the avenger subsides' (p. 237). We may ask : is the subjective mood of the avenger a basis for law? What if his rage never subsides (a most 9 Y. Kaufmann, Toledot ha-Emunah ha- Yisraelit I, Tel Aviv, 1938, p. 140 (Hebrew). 10 Weinfeld is led astray by Kaufmann's thesis that predicates multiple sanctuaries; see op. cit. (above, n. 7), p. 23, n. 78.</page><page sequence="5">160 J. MILGROM likely situation) ; is the manslayer confined to the city of refuge forever? Thus P's high priest still has an essential role to play in D's refuge system, one that is confirmed ra ther than negated by D's silence. (3) The law of warfare and (4) Sin and punishment. All arguments adduced in these sections are ex silentio. Since this kind of reasoning is precarious at best, care must be taken that all possible grounds have been investigated. Weinfeld has failed to do this and therein lies a flaw in his methodology. He attributes the absence of sacral law (fas) in D to opposition or indifference (pp. 240-42), but there is a third possibility : silence may imply consent. This possibility turns to probability upon the realization that D never opposes fas. The penalty of mD, for example, is not abolished or altered even once. Since scholars are largely in agreement that D presupposes the JE Code, it is startling that JE's laws are never transposed verbatim in D but are either reworked or cited in new contexts (e.g. compare Deut. 16:18-20 with Exod. 21:2, 5-6). This probably means that if D repeats a JE law in order to alter its meaning then it will omit a law when it is in agreement with it. D's silence therefore may mean acquies cence. If this be the case with the laws of JE, what of D's relationship to the Code? Weinfeld has correctly shown (following Kaufmann) that by the end of the pre-exilic period 'the book of Deuteronomy and the Priestly documents ... already existed in fixed literary form' (p. 183) and that 'it was the deuteronomic school that incorporated and redacted Priestly tradition' (p. 180). The same can be said, I believe, about their respective Codes. First, let it be noted, huge blocks of extant priestly law are intimated by D. 'The levitical priests ... shall live only off the Lord's offerings by fire ... WKD f? *)Tt, as He promised them' (18:1-2, italics mine). The sacrificial system and its priestly emoluments (Lev. chs. 1-7) are herewith presumed.11 'In cases of a scaly af fection (nsnx 5713) be careful to do exactly as the levitical priests instruct you. Take care to do oms ntPKD as I have instructed them9 (24:8, italics mine) ; D thus alludes to the existence of a system of impurities and purifications under the authority of the priests (Lev. 11-16). Indeed, in the case of the forbidden foods it has been shown that D actually quotes P.12 If then D presupposes a crystallized (if not final) form of P, is it plausible to argue that its silence in respect to P's laws bespeaks their abolition? So Weinfeld claims. For example, on the basis of 20:14, he concludes that 'according to D all spoils of war accrue to the warriors, and there is no need to consecrate any of them to the Lord' (p. 239). This ex silentio deduction cannot be correct because D never deprives God of His due. D describes many cultic changes but the altar receives the identical allotment as prescribed by (so 18:1-2, see above). Even the firstling must be dragged to the central sanctuary to yield its blood and suet on the altar although its meat is transferred n Even the laws of blemished sacrifices are intimated, Deut. 17:1 ; cf. Lev. 22:17-25. 12 Compare 14:12-18 with Lev. 11:13-19 ; cf. W. L. Moran : The Literary Connection between Lv. 11, 13-19 and Dt. 14,12-18, Catholic Biblical Quarterly 28 (1966), pp. 271-277.</page><page sequence="6">DEUTERONOMY, DEMYTHOLOGIZATION AND SECULARIZATION? 161 to the owner.13 Indeed, D in effect adds to the deity's portions (and to the glory of the temple and its clergy) when it agrees with JE (Exod. 23:18 ; 34:25) that the Pesach is a sacrifice and not a home ritual (so Exod. 12:3-14 [P]) and must be offered up at the Temple (16:1-7). As Israel's cultic history has demonstrated, because of the influence of D, Pesach became the most popular festival in the Temple calendar.14 Again, only because enactments like this one increased the power and prestige of the Jerusalem clergy is it possible to explain their enthusiastic sponsorship of Josiah's reform. Weinfeld forces D's silence to yield other incongruous results, e.g. the Festival of Booths was celebrated without booths (pp. 218-20); blasphemy was not forbidden (p. 240) ; sorcery, though forbidden, was not punished (pp. 240-41). However, no sooner is it predicated that omission is a sign of agreement than the incongruities dis appear, and with them D'? alleged secularization. Finally, let it be asked, does not Weinfeld's thesis of D's wisdom origins predicate an aversion to secularization? As is known, wisdom teaching inculcated reverence for and attention to institutions of re ligion as an essential requirement for achieving the good life.15 Thus D's wisdom orientation belies the notion of secularization. The reader should bear in mind that the above criticisms are directed at only fifty pages out of a total of four hundred ; they should in no way be construed as ques tioning the merit of the remaining seven-eighths of the book. A mere glance at the thematic appendix on Deuteronomic Phraseology, which details the deuteronomic impact upon the style of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah (pp. 320-365), and at the glos saries of all the terms in Hebrew and the cognate languages discussed in the book (pp. 388-410), will give an intimation of the encylopaedic scope of this work. Even Part , though here found wanting, is replete with suggestive insights, e.g. the remarks on the ger in (pp. 228-232). Space does not allow further exposition of Weinfeld's work. Suffice it to say that it will become the starting point of all future studies on the typology and wisdom orientation of the deuteronomic literature. Many problems await solution : there is still no satisfactory answer concerning the origins and textual history of D, an answer bearing heavily upon its ideology (which needs to be restudied, as indicated). For example, if the present critical position is upheld that D's frame work is composed of two strata or that the Code contains post-exilic interpolations, it will then be difficult to conceive of D as an ideological unity, as Weinfeld has assumed in his book. Happily, Weinfeld himself has shown in superb subsequent studies on covenant terminology16 that he is intent on pursuing his research in this vital field. This should generate satisfaction everywhere, since, at least for this reviewer, there is no one better equipped to do so. 13 It cannot be redeemed; cf.
