<plain_text><page sequence="1">Animating Matter: The Corpse as Idol in The Second Maiden's Tragedy SUSAN ZIMMERMAN Because actors, theatrical it is in large illusion part about is produced the body: largely the body through as constitutive the agency in the of actors, it is in large part about the body: the body as constitutive in the formation and expression of human ideas and emotions; the body as object of the spectator's gaze; the body as subject to the transformations of imper- sonation. Notwithstanding significant differences in theatrical traditions, the actor's body nonetheless constitutes the primary locus of performance. Yet in early modern England, at the same time that a burgeoning secular theater was fast becoming a new staple of English public life, Protestant reformers were castigating those uses of the body that made such per- formance possible. The homily on idolatry, for example, one of the most important polemical productions of the English Reformation, effectively precluded the performative agency of the actor as part of its larger attack on material (and especially anthropomorphic) images. The new theatrical industry did not, of course, repudiate itself in response to religious polemic, nor did it shrink from examining the issue of idolatry in its own right by means of corporeal representations. But in an important sense, this theater developed as theater in continual tension with a pervasive Protestant ideology that sought to revise the conceptual framework for apprehending the material body. My project in this essay is to examine the repercussions of this tension in a play that directly addresses the issue of idolatry - Thomas Middleton's The Second Maiden's Tragedy (1610/11). Middleton's play is unusual in 215</page><page sequence="2">216 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN that it features a sustained representation of necrophilia, a sensational and taboo form of idol worship. I shall argue that by focusing on the transgressive desire of a Tyrant who insists on the re/generative potential of the corpse, The Second Maiden's Tragedy is importantly implicated in the core concern of Protestant iconoclasmi that is, the question of what "dead" means in relation to materiality. Further, I shall suggest that by posing this question in performance, through the theater's own mode of anthropomorphic imaging, the play comments metatheatrically on two issues: the ideological reinscription of the body in early modern England and the parameters of dramatic impersonation as expressive medium. The Homily on Idolatry Among the objectives of the English Reformation was the transformation of Catholic hermeneutics, specifically (at least in the context of this essay) the Catholic reliance on body imagery for the interpretation of Christian mysteries. The zealous offensive against idolatrous practices launched by Protestant reformers in England and elsewhere was relentless, even obsessive, but their iconoclastic agenda could not be justified solely on the basis of long-standing abuses or even gross commercialism.1 Rather, the Reformation s attack on the anthropomorphism of Catholic images was symptomatic of its deep distrust of materiality and its properties: the materiality of the image or idol, the materiality of the body, and - at the most profound and originary level - the materiality of the corpse. Prior to the Reformation, and particularly in the late Middle Ages, the difficulty of reconciling ideal (resurrected and transfigured) and debased (postlapsarian and corrupted) bodies within a single redemptive scheme was a persistent concern of the Catholic Church. Transfiguration was not, of course, the only Christian mystery that foregrounded the body; it formed part of a larger gestalt in which the hypostatic union of divine and human natures in the person of Christ, and the centrality of Christ's body to the redemptive sacrifice, constituted the core of Christian belief. As Protestant reformers knew well, medieval Catholicism was acutely cognizant of, and theologically preoccupied by, the interdependent relationships between immaterial/material, soul/body in Christian ideology. Accordingly, Catholic ritual and iconography emphasized the paradox of the material transmis- sion of Christ's spiritual legacy, as in the sacrificial blood that poured from his crucified body, and the host that preserved the God/Man for physical</page><page sequence="3">Animating Matter 217 consumption by future generations. From the Catholic perspective, the transformative union of opposites in the matrix of the body enabled all the Christian mysteries; thus body images seemed altogether suitable as signifiers of the transcendental.2 But it was the ontological status of the corpse - in a sense, the ultimate relic - that foregrounded most dramatically the complexity of the relation- ship between ideal and debased bodies in the Christian system. Paradigmat- ically, the corpse occupied a problematically liminal space. The horror of its putrefaction, a punishment for original sin, underscored the corrupt status of the postlapsarian body; but the destination of the reconstituted corpse in an immortal and changeless union with the soul simultaneously rendered putrefaction as a transformative process, integral to redemption. Indeed, the function of putrefaction as transformation - that is, the generation of change by means of fragmentation and dissolution - was precisely the kind of phenomenon that Catholic theologians felt a responsibility to interrogate.3 To Protestant reformers, however, Catholic speculation about the liminal properties of the corpse dangerously distorted the body-soul relationship by implying that generative power might be a constituent property of mate- riality, and thus that the material body had an independent or autonomous viability - a "life" without benefit of informing spirit.4 Their anxiety about the consequences of this distortion resulted in an effort to reformulate materiality as definitively dead, and the homily on idolatry ("Against Peril of Idolatry and Superfluous Decking of Churches"), first published in English in 1563, served as an important tool in this initiative.5 Interestingly, the homily's agenda for demystifying materiality by condemning anthropomor- phic idols proceeds, at least implicitly, from an argument about the corpse that is a tour de force of circular reasoning. This argument implies that any interrogation of the mode by which the corpse is transfigured is spurious because the change from nonbeing to being is a miracle of God.6 In this context, the corpse, as nonbeing, is axiomatically dead; indeed, it is, beyond disputation, the only entity that can fully demonstrate what "dead" means. In one noteworthy example, the homily emphasizes the originary deadness of the corpse by reference to the biblical account of the first idol: . . . the origin of images, and the worshipping of them, as it is recorded in the eighth chapter of the book of Wisdom, began of a blind love of a fond father, framing for</page><page sequence="4">218 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN his comfort an image of his son, being dead, and so at the last men fell to the worshipping of the image of him, whom they did know to be dead . . . (205) In this narrative, the need of a grief-stricken father for the revivification of a dead son (and not the desire to proliferate false gods) is the stimulus for idolatry, so that the status of idol correlates directly with that of the son's dead body. Here and elsewhere, by strategically affirming the deadness of the corpse as self-evident premise, the homily succeeds in conjuring its image with every utterance of the word "dead" and in rendering this image virtually omnipresent throughout the text, at the same time that it erases the problem that the corpse represented to medieval Catholicism. Thus, whereas formerly the corpse emblematized one of the most vexing of Christian paradoxes - that is, the relationship of the generative process of putrefaction to that of transfiguration- in the homily the corpse is presented as incontestable evidence that this relationship is a nonissue. At bottom, what the homily attacks on every front are the linkages be- tween transformative body processes and spiritual transformation in the Catholic system. Thus the brilliance of appropriating the corpse, the most fearsomely fluid and indeterminate of material entities, as the standard for "dead." This strategy supports the real business of the homily, which is to harden the distinction between material and immaterial in order to shift emphasis from the humanity of Christ to the divinity of God the Father, and from the body as hermeneutic matrix to the soul as ascendant spiritual principle. Thus the body is described in virtual opposition to the soul, and the bodily properties that make visual representation possible - materiality and externality - are condemned as "dead." Further, visual representations themselves, which replicate the dead properties of the body rather than its interior spirit, are likewise "dead" - or in the metaphor of the homily's mantra, "dead as stocks and stones," "dead as blocks and stocks." In a somewhat paradoxical extension of this premise, the homily argues (in accordance with Judeo-Christian tradition) that the danger of "dead" im- ages resides in their power to stimulate carnal desire: And it was very agreeable (as St. Paul teacheth) that they which fell to idolatry, which is spiritual fornication, should also fall into carnal fornication, and all uncleanness . . . (191) The rationale for conjoining these two kinds of fornication is not apparent: how, after all, does a "dead" image serve as a powerful transmitter of affect,</page><page sequence="5">Animating Matter 219 especially that of strong sexual desire? The homily obfuscates this slippage through a lengthy and vigorous polemic against the harlot or painted woman, whose artificial allure, which is exactly like that of the idol, enables both kinds of idolatry: Doth not the word of God call ... a gilt or painted idol, or image, a strumpet with a painted face? . . . the nature of man is none otherwise bent to worshipping of images . . . than it is bent to whoredom and adultery in the company of harlots. (206) Thus the strumpet, who not only demonstrates the connection between spiritual and carnal fornication but herself offers simultaneous experience of both, puts man in a kind of double jeopardy. Moreover, the homily implies, if only obliquely, that because both painted face and gilded image are "dead," carnal fornication with the strumpet can be viewed as a form of necrophilia. Significantly, the fiercest rhetoric of the homily is reserved for the mon- strous but presumably exemplary career of the Byzantine Empress Irene, who supposedly played a prominent role in the ninth-century schism between the Greek and Western churches over the issue of idolatry. In rehearsing Irene's contribution to the so-called Byzantine precedent,7 the homily sets up a series of misogynistic associations in which Irene's taint is connected first to the goddesses of pagan mythology and later to the hierarchy of Catholic saints. The cumulative effect of this strategy is to demonize all women across a spectrum that situates Irene in the center, with Venus and Diana at one end and the Blessed Virgin Mary at the other: When you hear of our Lady of Walsingham, our Lady of Ipswich, our Lady of Wilsdon, and such others; what is it but an imitation of the Gentiles idolaters? Diana Agrotera, Diana Coriphea, Diana Ephesia, &amp;c. Venus Cyria, Venus Paphia, Venus Gnidia. (188) In thus denigrating the Virgin's exalted position in the Catholic hierarchy of saints, the homily underscores one of its strongest beliefs - that the distinc- tion between carnal and spiritual fornication itself collapses in the wan- tonness of bodily images. Beneath the "decking" of the harlot/strumpet and the goddess/idol is an all-encompassing "whoredom" which serves, finally, as metaphor for the Catholic Church itself. In the end - and despite the centrality of the Incarnation to Christianity - the homily comes close to denying the interdependence of body and</page><page sequence="6">220 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN soul.8 By identifying the Catholic idol, in summary, as a "gross [= material], bodily, and visible similitude" (179), and gendering it as female, the homily sets up the terms by which it will present the Protestant alternative to "the Mother of Whoredom." In complete opposition to the idol, God the Father is "pure Spirit" (179) - immaterial, ^embodied, mvisible - and, both directly and by analogy, gendered male. Distrustful of the ambiguities of Christian ideology, the text would point toward categorical clarities, aiming to establish a strong foundation for affirming a noncorporeal God, mysterious and antecedent. As I suggested earlier, the homily on idolatry was only part of a larger re- formist effort to rob the body of its inordinate status of parity with the soul. But because for centuries Catholic traditions had permeated English culture in public and private life,9 efforts by the faithful to come to terms with the Reformation's devalued body were unavoidably conflicted. More than any other physical entity, the corpse gave definition to this conflict. However much the new ideology might try to marginalize materiality, it could not deny the centrality of transfiguration to Christian redemption. The corpse, an integral part of this process, presented a conundrum - that is, a "dead" body whose liminality was somehow inscribed in materiality itself. Idolatry and the Early Modern Theater If the corpse, or the paradox of its signification, can be said to lie at the heart of the Protestant case against materiality, its representation on the stage simultaneously challenged both the ideological and performative agency of the early modern theater. Inevitably, this theater evoked its own problematic relationship to the body-soul conundrum every time it "performed" a corpse for a large and heterogeneous audience, and particularly when it attempted to represent the corpse as stimulus to carnal fornication or idolatrous object of desire. In one sense, of course, to speak of idolatry in connection with the theater is a kind of oxymoron. All theatrical representation depends on artifice: performance, or playacting, is a self-conscious pretense. But if artifice is the sine qua non of any performance, the early modern theater in England pointedly called attention to the conventions that shaped its fictions, to the inner workings, as it were, of the fantasy machine. The distinctiveness of this theater was its metatheatricality: the representation of illusion in a mode that called attention to representation as illusion.</page><page sequence="7">Animating Matter 221 Such metatheatricality precluded drama that we have come to associate with the later tradition of realism- that is, drama constructed on the premise that the illusion must seem "real." On the contrary, performances on the early modern public stage were at midday, whatever the supposed time of a play's action, with most of the elevated platform stage open to the elements; scenery was minimal and for the most part symbolic; and the arrangement of the audience around a three-sided stage precluded a comprehensive view of the action for many spectators. Further, in both public and private theaters, poetic language (including soliloquies and asides), emblematic and stylized modes of acting, unlocalized settings, anachronistic costuming, the mixing of dramatic genres and tonalities, and disparities of time and place all militated against illusionist representation. By showcasing such gaps between fiction and performance, early modern drama encouraged the audience to maintain a double perspective, that is, an identification with the fiction and a simultaneous recognition that this fiction was a pretense, an artificial construct. On one hand, the self-consciousness of metatheatricality would seem to have protected the theater, at least to some degree, against the charge that its artifice was designed to deceive. But the dual perspective required of the theatrical spectator was notably akin to that of the Catholic wor- shiper before the statue, and reformers, among other critics, were acutely aware of this affinity. Moreover, theatrical performance, which fundamen- tally depended on the blurring of categorical divides through the agency of impersonation, posed its own, independent danger to viewers. Each instance of impersonation enacted some convergence of actor/fictional figure, disguise/identity, and it was the actor's business to proliferate such confusions, to multiply roles. As fragmentors or disintegrators of the "self," actors could thereby be seen as idol makers, and spectators who invested such impersonations with any measure of credibility, or false substantiality, as idol worshipers. In addition, the idolatrous ambience of impersonation was significantly compounded by the centuries-old tradition of transvestite acting, or the impersonation of women by boy actors. Transvestism foreclosed the pos- sibility of representing women apart from the agency of male bodies, which meant that no female figure in an early modern play could be represented as unproblematically gendered, nor could the representation of erotic desire be unproblematically differentiated by sex. By virtue of this division or conflation of conventional gender and sexual distinctions, transvestism</page><page sequence="8">222 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN enabled the theater to interrogate the viability of the male-female divide and to explore fluid and shifting erotic valances - from an iconoclast's viewpoint, a kind of free-floating concupiscence.10 Antitheatrical polemicists, who heatedly denounced the theater as idol- atrous, were especially exercised over what they saw as the shamelessly overt way in which stage performances linked idolatry and lust. John Rainolds, one of the most learned and alarmed of these critics, leveled a sustained attack against the temptations of transvestism in a disputa- tious correspondence between 1591 and 1594 with two Oxford scholars, William Gager and Alberico Gentili.11 In one instance, he compared the erotic power of cross-dressed "beautifull boyes" to that of a bigendered, animated idol: . . . beware of beautifull boyes transformed into women by putting on their raiment, their feature, lookes, and facions. For men may be ravished with loue of stones, of dead stuffe, framed by cunning grauers to beautifull womens likenes ... [so also] the cladding of youthes in such attire is an occasion of drawing and provoking corruptlie minded men to most heinous wickedness . . .12 Presumably, Rainolds would not have included himself among his group of "corruptlie minded men," but the passion with which he condemned transvestism bears eloquent witness to Rainolds's own fear of the theater's seductive power. To lose oneself in multiple, unlocalized desires was to risk losing, at least momentarily, the spiritual integrity of a centering self. Despite their deep distrust of impersonation as idolatrous, however, Rainolds and his fellow polemicists did not specifically address the signifi- cance of the corpse on stage. In a sense, their preoccupation with the allure of transvestism precluded attention to the more profoundly unsettling implications of the dead body: nonetheless, the corpse was the ultimate site of the problem of idolatry and of impersonation. If, as Elizabeth Bronfen has argued in the context of the visual arts, every image of death is fetishistic in that it suggests "a severing of the body from its real materiality," 13 then the image of the theatrical corpse is especially complicated in that the material body itself serves as agent for the image: theater is, in Stephen Greenblatt's phrase, "illusory embodiment " (my emphasis).14 Thus the representation of the corpse on the early modern stage entailed the metatheatrical recog- nition not only of an illusion, but in effect of a double illusion - an illusion of an illusion. That is, a material, sentient body was supposed to signify an</page><page sequence="9">Animating Matter 223 insentient one, severed from "its real materiality" - a ¿//¿embodied body. Further, because death was outside the experience of actor and theatergoer alike, "corpseness" itself was unsignifiable. As a disembodied body only in potentia, the body of the actor was thereby enjoined to represent the unrepresentable on several levels, in what might be called the consummate instance of metatheatricality. Yet another complicating set of valences came into play whenever a boy actor was enjoined to impersonate a female corpse, especially, of course, if this corpse were an object of infatuation. Certainly the erotic charge of gender ambiguity, as Rainolds argued so cogently, was an integral part of the early modern theater s ambience. But the eroticism of the cross- dressed corpse was distinctive in that this corpse purported to blur both male-female and body-spirit divides; further, as idol, it interrogated the nature of desire in the absence, as it were, of these categorical structures. As an erotic object in which sexual attractiveness and "deadness" were presumably indistinguishable, the corpse/idol thus invited the audience to a voyeuristic engagement, if only on a subconscious level, with the farthest reaches of eroticism.15 On one level, then, the representation of the corpse/idol in the early modern theater demarcated the limits of that theater's performative agency by calling attention metatheatrically to the artifice of the living actor in- habiting the "corpse," the male actor inhabiting the "female" body, and the compounded artifice of the corpse/idol. Moreover, in several plays featur- ing necrophilia, sensationalist staging provided yet another metatheatrical dimension. In The Second Maiden's Tragedy ' for example, the female idol/corpse was ostentatiously propped up in a chair and cosmeticized in full view of the audience, pointedly calling attention to the body of the actor who occupied the chair, and to the many layers of artifice in his multiple makeovers.16 Paradoxically, however, by thus foregrounding the ambiguities of its own conventions, early modern performance deconstructed gender categories which ordinarily grounded erotic experience for spectators. Just as signifi- cantly, such performance also alluded, if only obliquely, to what lay outside the possibilities of all representation - to the singular fearsomeness of the wwcategorizable, the marginal, the in-between. If the ostensible referent for the theatrical corpse was the putrefying corpse - a disembodied body on its way to becoming a not-body, a body, as it were, in the grips of</page><page sequence="10">224 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN a primordial (or, as Christianity would have it, transfigurating) process - then the impossibility of representing such a corpse on stage raised the specter of indeterminacy itself as the unsignifiable other. To be sure, Middleton's tragicomedy, which provides the most fully de- veloped representation of necrophilia on the early modern stage, ostensibly adopted the official iconoclastic stance of the Protestant establishment. Vetted and approved by the Master of the Revels, the play borrowed from medieval Catholic legend to satirize Catholic practices, basing its Tyrant protagonist on the biblical Herod, king of Judea, made famous in England by his prominent position in the Catholic mystery cycles. But in the early seventeenth century, what made Herod a compelling protagonist and a target for iconoclastic attack had more to do with his reputed infatuation with the corpse of his dead wife than with his campaign against the infant Christ. By enacting this legend under a formal sanction, the theater would seem, at least theoretically, to be demonstrating the ruinous consequences of idolatry. Nonetheless, as we have seen, the theater's own performative process obviated any such straightforward representation. This is not to say that plays about idolatry on the English Renaissance stage deliberately set out to subvert reformist ideology. But it is to suggest that theatrical interventions in the controversy over idol worship were, deliberately or indeliberately, performances in which discourses of the time were doubly and problem- atically reinscribed: as commentary on the issues, and as commentary on the theater's singular relationship to these issues. The Second Maiden's Tragedy Over a period of centuries in medieval England, the popular reputation of Herod, king of Judea at the time of Christ's birth, became increasingly larger-than-life.17 Repeatedly featured in biblical commentary and vernacu- lar sermons, and dramatized in the Corpus Christi cycles, Herod emerged as an Antichrist, a would-be god who slaughtered rather than saved, his secular career a perverse inversion of Christ's redemptive sacrifice. Herod's savagery in ordering the massacre of Judean male infants under the age of two was associated with his paganism, his birth as a Saracen outside the Judeo-Christian tradition. But Herod's monstrous otherness was not wholly comprehended by his pagan roots. As Antichrist, he was presumed to be impervious to all civilized restraints, defiant of taboo. His necrophiliac</page><page sequence="11">Animating Matter 225 attachment later in life to the corpse of his wife Mariamne represented an insane autonomy, that is, a refusal to recognize his subservience to the laws of nature and a reckless assertion of his own power over death. In view of such unnatural aggression, the Christian faithful considered Herod's epileptic frenzies and gruesome demise (usually described as consumption by worms) as symbolically suitable punishments. The chief sources in England for the Herod legend were the Gospels, particularly the Vulgate version of Matthew, and two works by the Jewish historian Flavius Josephus: The Jewish War, 69-79 c.e., and Of the Antiq- uities of the Jews , c. 93 c.e.18 Matthew's accounts of Herod's interrogation of the Magi and his subsequent slaughter of the innocents became popular staples of the mystery plays and vernacular sermons. Josephus mentions neither of these incidents but provides detailed and sometimes conflicting descriptions of Herod's political career (including his three-year siege of Judea and bloody defeat of Jerusalem), his marriage to Mariamne, the slay- ing of Mariamne and her presumed lover, Herod's passionate lamentation after her death, and his own horrible end.19 The only direct reference to Herod's necrophilia is found in the Babylonian Talmud, where Herod is said to have worshiped Mariamne 's corpse, preserved in honey, for seven years.20 Because the medieval mystery plays focused on Herod's challenge to Christ as narrated by Matthew, they emphasized Herod as self-appointed idol, ruthless rival to his infant competitor. This royal and fearsome Herod, sumptuously dressed and fitted with the accoutrements of kingship, was by all accounts a visually compelling image on stage.21 But the melodramatic posturings that increasingly became a staple of Herod's stage persona, the rantings and temper tantrums, rendered the figure of the Antichrist, at least some of the time, as farcical - a secular version of the medieval Vice.22 The inclusion of comic elements in scenes of brutality or tragedy was, of course, a distinctive feature of English native drama (as in the jesting of the soldiers in scenes of the crucifixion). But the doppelgänger approach to Herod's representation (and that of the Vice as well, for that matter) served the particular purpose of diminishing Herod's show of power by transforming him into a kind of grotesquerie.23 In this curious posture, Herod's puissance - his credibility as an adversary of Christ - was indistinguishable from his status as fool. Middleton's Herod-like Tyrant in The Second Maiden 's Tragedy (1610/ II)24 is also a grotesquerie, a melodramatic posturer whose behavior undercuts</page><page sequence="12">226 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN his grandiose claims, but here he appears in the context of the talmudic story of Herod's fixation with the corpse of Mariamne. On two occasions, the Tyrant invites a direct comparison between his idolatrous intentions and those of Herod. In act 4, scene 3, a scene with a probable antecedent in a passage from Josephus which describes Herod desecrating the tomb of David,25 the Tyrant breaks into the tomb of the Lady (object of his obsession) and addresses her corpse: I once read of a Herod, whose affection Pursued a virgin's love, as I did thine, Who for the hate she owed him killed herself (As thou too rashly didst), without all pity. Yet he preserved her body dead in honey, And kept her long after her funeral. (4.3.115-20) Later, in another apostrophe to the Lady's corpse, the Tyrant vows to match the duration of Herod's necrophilia: "I love thee yet, above all women living, / And shall do sev'n year hence" (5.2.25-2Ó).26 By thus reenacting Herod's hyperbolic persona not only as tyrant but also as necrophiliac, Middleton's protagonist signifies both as quasi-comic overreacher (Herod as would-be idol) and as worshiper of the dead (Herod as idolater), a combination that underscores the iconoclastic connection between over- valuation of self and overvaluation of the material body. Because of the sensational manner in which he exercises power, the Tyrant dominates the main action of The Second Maiden's Tragedy. After usurping the throne, he claims as his queen a chaste Lady, betrothed to the rightful king, Govianus; the Lady kills herself rather than submit to the Tyrant's will; the Tyrant, refusing to accept the Lady's death and vowing to reverse it, violates her tomb, steals her corpse, and threatens to make love to it; the ghost of the Lady, through the agency of Govianus, orchestrates the rescue of her corpse before the Tyrant can fully carry out his design; and, in a spectacular denouement, the Tyrant dies after kissing the cosmeticized corpse, whose lips have been poisoned by Govianus. The final passages of the play restore Govianus to the throne.27 Traditionally, the central conflict between the Lady (via her surrogate, Govianus) and the Tyrant has been interpreted allegorically, as the triumph of chastity over lust.28 To be sure, the Lady represents herself as a saint with Govianus as her holy avenger, and virtually everyone at the court identifies</page><page sequence="13">Animating Matter ITI the Tyrant as obsessed and depraved. Further, the death of the Tyrant in the final scene, the reintegration of the Lady's body and soul, and the restora- tion of Govianus to the throne would appear to reinstate the moral order that the Tyrant has usurped. But because, wittingly or unwittingly, the play deconstructs its own ideological oppositions, this allegorical framework serves as template for a much less straightforward representation of idol worship, and the supposed resolution seems awkward and formulaic.29 Much of the ideological confusion in the play derives from dividing the figure of the Lady into three personae that are ultimately irreconcilable: the living Lady, prior to her suicide in midplay; her sainted spirit or ghost; and her desecrated corpse.30 These divisions make clear that the Lady's corpse is without spirit, or, from an iconoclast's perspective, dead. Yet the desperation with which the Lady's spirit seeks to rescue this corpse, and the intense jealousy that Govianus feels at the prospect of its violation by the Tyrant, confuse the boundaries between good and evil, living and dead, saint and strumpet. The play may demonize the Tyrant as monster, but the presumed forces of virtue ultimately prove complicit in his transgression. As ostensible foil to the Tyrant, Govianus, the rightful king, is himself committed to the worship of a material idol. Interestingly, the sexual competition that initially links these adversaries is exacerbated when the Lady's suicide removes her body, the object of rival desires, from the scene. Shortly after her death, Govianus addresses the Lady's dead body as "thou delicious treasure of mankind" (3.1.244), and in a curious anticipation of the Tyrant's own final embraces, caresses it: "I will kiss thee / After death's marble lip" (3.1.250-51). Later, his exaltation in the Lady's ghost is not unlike that of the Tyrant in her corpse. Upon first viewing the ghost, Govianus feels a "fever" worth more than "all the pleasures often thousand ages" (4.4.52-53); moreover, he seems unmoved by the fate of her corpse until the Lady goads his sexual jealousy: I am now at court In his own private chamber. There he woos me And plies his suit to me with as serious pains As if the short flame of mortality Were lighted up again in my cold breast; Folds me within his arms and often sets A sinful kiss upon my senseless lip . . . (4.4.66-72)</page><page sequence="14">228 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN To a significant degree, then, Govianus's attachment to a spirit he envis- ages in material terms and to whom he has an overtly sensual devotion compromises his outrage at the Tyrant's necrophilia. Ultimately it is not in the interests of either the Tyrant or Govianus to forfeit his sexual claim to the Lady by accepting the consequences of her death: neither a moidering corpse nor a decorporalized ghost serves their respective purposes.31 But the function of Govianus as mirror/foil is most striking in the de- nouement, when (in disguise) he would redeem the Lady's corpse by desecrating it. While obeying the Tyrant's command to "hide death upon her face" (5.2.81) by painting the Lady's features, Govianus acknowledges that his act is sacrilegious: "A religious trembling shakes me by the hand / And bids me put by such unhallowed business, / But revenge calls for't" (5.2.91-93). Still, he is willing to risk his own spiritual integrity in order to prevent the Tyrant from despoiling - and thereby possessing - the Lady's body. His final taunt is that of the tainted avenger who rationalizes sacrilege in terms of his proprietary claim on the Lady's ghost: Doom me, Tyrant. Had I feared death, I'd never appeared noble To seal this act upon me, which e'en honours me Unto my mistress' spirit. It loves me for't. (5.2.146-49) But if Govianus is implicated in the unholy desire of the Tyrant, it is the saintly Lady herself who stokes their passion by establishing her dead body as a kind of trophy. In her first appearance as ghost, the Lady stresses to Govianus the urgency of rescuing her corpse from rape, although it is unclear how the status of the corpse can affect the salvation (and presumably the sainthood) that she has already won: On a sudden , in a kind of noise like a wind , the doors clattering, the tombstone flies open , and a great light appears in the midst of the tomb; his LADY, as went out [that is, as she last appeared] , standing just before him all in white, stuck with jewels, and a great crucifix on her breast. (S.DAAÁ 2.1-4) Inexplicably, at least from an iconoclastic perspective, the Lady implies that defilement of her material corpse is capable of canceling out her self- sacrificial suicide32 and of disturbing the tranquillity of her afterlife:</page><page sequence="15">Animating Matter 229 The peace that death allows me is not mine; The monument is robbed. Behold, I'm gone; My body taken up. (4.4.60-62) My rest is lost; thou must restore' t again. (4.4.79) Even Govianus is initially puzzled that the Lady's spirit needs defending: Welcome! Who wrongs the spirit of my love? Thou art above the injuries of blood; They cannot reach thee now. (4.4.55-57)33 By the end of the play, however, Govianus has adopted the Lady's premise as his justification for murdering the Tyrant: "... thy abuser falls, and has no pow'r / To vex thee farther now " (5.2.162-63, emphasis mine). The Lady's overvaluation of her corpse unavoidably evokes the Catholic fixation with materiality so inimical to reformists, an association reinforced in the play by references to purgatory, Sanctus bells, Latin prayers, and rosaries, as well as to the Lady's own "jewels" and "great crucifix." To be sure, the play's Catholic ambience is hardly surprising considering its subject matter. Nonetheless, the spirit "all in white" who represents the supernatural antidote to the Tyrant's transgression, and who orchestrates his downfall, should not, theoretically, be infected with his sin. Fundamen- tally at issue here is whether it was possible for Jacobean drama to address the contentious issue of idolatry without seeming to conflate conflicting ideologies through its use of Catholic trappings.34 But the morally ambiguous representations of Govianus and the Lady de- velop primarily as a function of their responses to the Tyrant's "annihilating autonomy,"35 the benchmark against which idolatrous and anti-idolatrous stances must be measured in the play. From the outset, the Tyrant fixates on the Lady as the sole signifier of his desires: "There was but one / In whom my heart took pleasure (amongst women), / One in the whole creation . . ." (1.1.10-12). Without her: "If it were possible to be less than nothing, / 1 wake the man you seek for" (1.1 .141-42). The intensity of the Tyrant's longing prompts him to configure his sexual conquest of the Lady as a form of religious commitment - she is his "heart's saint" (2.3.109),</page><page sequence="16">230 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN his "blessed object" (4. 3. 59). But her resistance and subsequent suicide challenge this idealizing fantasy, and the Tyrant retaliates by establishing, through violent means, a fetishistic surrogate for the Lady's living body over which he has absolute power. Initially, he would transcend the limitations of his humanity through an erotic investment in a material icon; by the time of his death, he has hypostatized materiality itself as antecedent to spirit, and his own erotic energy as a life-giving force. Throughout the play, the Tyrant's fixation is continually betrayed by his dependence on the sensory perception of external forms - he must always have his Lady in sight: Methinks the day e'en darkens at her absence. I stand as in a shade, when a great cloud Muffles the sun . . . (1.1.212-14) I must not miss her; I want her sight too long. (2.3.3) I've lost the comfort of her sight for ever. (4.2.30) I cannot keep from sight of her so long. I starve mine eye too much. (5.2.Ó-7)36 To be deprived of "her sight" is tantamount to standing "upon a frozen mountain, / Without the confines" of the promised "kingdom" (1.1.144- 45, 142), a kind of death-in-life. Paradoxically, the Tyrant seeks deliverance from this torturous alienation in the disinterment of the Lady's cold and lifeless body, and he welcomes the pale light that fills the darkened crypt as a resurgence, albeit in a less resplendent form, of her influence: O, the moon rises! What reflection Is thrown about this sanctified building E'en in a twinkling! How the monuments glister, As if death's palaces were all massy silver And scorned the name of marble! Art thou cold? I have no faith in't yet; I believe none. (4.3.80-85)</page><page sequence="17">Animating Matter 231 In the absence of the Lady, the Tyrant is "less than nothing"; his "new joy" (4.2.33) is to find that her lost presence remains visible to him in her corpse: O blessed object! I never shall be weary to behold thee; I could eternally stand thus and see thee. (4.3.59-61) The pleasure of spiritual fornication, of beholding the "blessed object," is not, however, enough for the Tyrant: living or dead, the Lady-as-idol incites his carnal appetites as well. For him, the pleasures of sight and touch are, in fact, indivisible, as seen earlier in his violent response to the Lady's rejection ("Force shall help nature" [2. 3. 74]), and in the mode of punishment that he devises for his sexual rival: Nay, more, to vex his soul give command straight They [Govianus and the Lady] be divided into several rooms, Where he may only have a sight of her, To his mind's torment, but his arms and lips Locked up like felons from her. (1.1.232-36) By "resurrecting" the Lady, the Tyrant has of course condemned himself to an identical fate so long as he acknowledges the taboo against necrophilia. That he will not do so is already apparent in the grim resolve with which he addresses the soldiers who accompany him to the crypt: "Death nor the marble prison my love sleeps in / Shall keep her body locked up from mine arms" (4.2.48-49).37 As the Tyrant's desire intensifies, so do his fantasies of power. He would pursue his idolatrous passion through a godlike aggrandizement of himself - the corpse will come alive through an act of his will. Alluding to Herod's example ("Yet he preserved her body dead in honey, / And kept her long after her funeral" [4.3-1 19-20]), he first appropriates external artifice as a means of validating his fantasy: But I'll unlock the treasure house of art With keys of gold, and bestow all on thee . . . (4.3.121-22)</page><page sequence="18">232 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN I can see nothing to be mended in thee But the too constant paleness of thy cheek . . . (5.2.27-28) And as in such a season men will force A heat into their bloods with exercise, In spite of extreme weather, so shall we By art force beauty on yon lady's face Though death sit frowning on't a storm of hail To beat it off. Our pleasure shall prevail . . . (5.2.107-12) Unlike the gilded surface of the painted statue, however, the cosmeticized face of the corpse will not be lifelike " 'sev'n year hence" (5.2.26), and the Tyrant's continued "sight" of the Lady ultimately will require the intervention of a more powerful kind of art. Although the question that roils the play is whether the Tyrant will have sexual intercourse with the Lady's corpse, as the Lady's spirit fears, this threat is not imminent until the Tyrant moves to resuscitate the corpse with his own libidinal - or as his fantasy would have it - creative energy.38 At the outset of this final desecration, with the corpse "decked / In all the glorious riches of our palace" (5.2.8-9) and seated in a chair so that the court may " make obeisance " (S.D. 13.4-5), the Tyrant acknowledges that paint can neither reverse the body's corruption nor permeate the "everlasting frost hangs now upon her" (5.2.106). Nevertheless, in an about-face that is also a reprise of his earlier threat to rape the living Lady ("Force shall help nature" [2. 3. 74]), he resolves to suborn art to his implacable will: Tyr. Keep her up; I'll have her swoon no more; there's treachery in t. Does she not feel warm to thee? Gov. Very little, sir. Tyr. The heat wants cherishing, then. Our arms and lips Shall labour life into her. Wake, sweet mistress! Tis I that call thee at the door of life. [AYsses the body ] (5.2.115-20) In this travesty of divine creation, the soul no longer signifies; as the Tyrant claimed earlier, "The house is hers; the soul is but a tenant" (5.2.3). He would thus "renew heat / Within her bosom" (5.2.96-97), regenerate her corporeal form, with the fire of his own passion, insisting that whereas</page><page sequence="19">Animating Matter 233 ordinary fire cannot "burn back again . . . hard, tough bodies" from "dead ashes" (5.2.101-2), desire can. It is not, finally, the recognition of his own impending death from the poisoned kiss that will bring the Tyrant to despair, but the appearance of the Lady's invincible spirit as witness to the insubstantiality of her tenantless corpse: "I called not thee, thou enemy to firmness, / Mortality's earthquake š'n (5.2.153-54, emphasis mine). By exposing the Tyrant s belief in the primacy of materiality as delusional, this final sequence supports the homily's charge that for a man to engage in sexual relations with a woman whose artifice masks spiritual emptiness (that is, a strumpet) is to surrender to corruption, moral and physical. The Tyrant s necrophiliac transgression is distinctive, however, in that he would possess a strumpet of his own making, a contaminated version of a dead body others regard as saintly and that he himself would bring to life. Further, whereas the incipient death that lurks beneath the mask of the living strumpet exists only in potentia, the Tyrant's strumpet, represented as dead, is already, as it were, unmasked. There is, then, a curious inversion of the homily's exemplum in the play's denouement: the Tyrant purports to transform the Lady's corpse back into the living body of the painted strumpet. The verbal and visual imagery of the scene underscores the horror of this inversion. When the Lady's corpse is carried on stage " dressed up in black velvet which sets out the paleness of the hands and face " (S.D. 5.2.13.1- 2), it already appears unnatural, and the Song which accompanies this entrance urges the audience to think of the body as putrefying: O, what is beauty, that's so much adored? A flatt'ring glass that cozens her beholders. One night of death makes it look pale and horrid; The dainty preserved flesh, how soon it moulders. (5.2.14-17) The Lady's "dainty preserved flesh" (probably whitened with powder or paint) is thus described as "horrid" before Govianus desecrates her face with yet another layer of artifice. After the completion of this "unhallowed business," the supposedly moidering corpse, falsely vivified with poisonous and corrosive cosmetics, would, one assumes, look ghoulish - the Tyrant's corpse-strumpet reconstructed as primordial death mask.39 Significant, when the Tyrant kisses the poisoned lips of the Lady, he is unable to distinguish the "evil scent" (5.2. 122) of the poison from that of the corpse.</page><page sequence="20">234 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN In the production of the play (161 1/12?) by the King's Men, the symbolic status of the corpse was further destabilized as a result of doubling the roles of Richard Robinson, a boy actor who played both the Lady and the Lady's spirit, dressed, respectively, in black and in white.40 Prior to her suicide, the Lady appears "clad in black" (S.D. 1.1.1 11.1-2) to protest the usurpation of Govianus, so that the brilliant white of the apparition attests to the primacy of her living spirit over that of her dead body. But the point of this contrast would have been at least partially subverted in the King's Men's production by spectator recognition of Robinson's shift, and more seriously disturbed by the confused color-coding of the denouement, where the Lady's spirit appears "in the same form as the Lady is dressed in the chair" (S.D. 5.2. 152. 1-2), which is to say, the corpse, spectacularly decked "in black velvet" (S.D. 13.1, emphasis mine). Here, the black costuming connects the spirit not only to the former body of the Lady but also to its depraved transformation into the Tyrant's idol. Thus although the final visual emblem of the play suggests the reunification of the divided Lady ("The Spirit . . . stays to go out with the body ; as it were attending it " [S.D. 205. 1 -2]), it also implicates the ghost in the wanton and unnatural degradation of the now murderous corpse. These ideological confusions are, in fact, exacerbated throughout the scene by the strategies of its staging. For the Tyrant's court to pay homage to his enthroned idol, as he commands, the corpse must occupy a prominent position on stage that would help fix the audience's full attention on the sensational business of painting its face.41 During this process, antithetical visual images of the Lady, as saint and as strumpet, blur or converge, finally coming to rest, as it were, in the indeterminacy of the ghoulish mask. But although these turns and shifts provide a stunning visual metaphor for the categorical confusions of idolatry, it is, after all, the Lady's body that has become the emblem of the strumpet, and the Lady's corpse that the Tyrant is on the cusp of violating. The homily against idolatry may conflate the statues of the Blessed Virgin Mary (saint) and the goddess Venus (strumpet) as equally whorish in their function as idols, but here the Tyrant's delusion of the corpse as idol is represented by the same body - the saint's body - that is in league with the saint's soul to vanquish this delusion. In addition, the metatheatrical effects of the transvestite convention, coupled with the Tyrant's explicit lovemaking, invest the corpse with complicated sexual nuances both at the conclusion of the play and in</page><page sequence="21">Animating Matter 235 the earlier tomb scene. The Tyrant crosses a sacrosanct boundary when he enfolds the dead Lady in his arms in act 5, scene 1 and kisses her, imposing, as it were, his contaminating imprint on her body. But in act 5, scene 2, this invasive act is immediately preceded by the visually compelling painting of the corpse - or more precisely, the painting of a boy actor already made up to resemble a woman. By evoking the role of cosmetics in the theater's own construction (and displacement) of gender categories, this sequence emphasizes the artificiality of the corpse's supposed sexual allure - the boy beneath the saint, the strumpet, and the woman. When the Tyrant fondles a body in which the distinctions among these images are blurred, a body that is also represented as dead, he generates an erotic frisson with cross- and transgendered as well as transgressive valences. But the most obtrusive of the metatheatrical interventions in this climac- tic sequence of events is the representation of the dead body itself through the agency of the sentient actor. As necrophiliac lover in the tradition of Herod, the Tyrant represents the undisguised desire to unite one's being directly with death - a kind of ur-idolatry. That is, rather than confusing the dead image for the living being, as would an ordinary idolater, the Tyrant recognizes the manifest presence of death in his idol but defiantly seeks to subsume and transform it. From this perspective, the poisoned kiss signifies, quite literally, the originary moment in which the Tyrant fails to overwhelm - or in the imagery of the scene, to rape - death. But because the theatrical corpse can be "performed" only by a living body, layered in artifice that cannot be disassembled, what should serve as the ultimate exposé (of the underlying horror of idolatry - the literal embrace of putrefaction - looks more like an enactment of its dynamics. Thus it would seem that the ideological confusions of The Second Maiden's Tragedy foreclosed the possibility of doctrinal orthodoxy despite the play's ostensible condemnation of idolatry. At the same time, how- ever, these confusions, legitimated by the play's purported iconoclasm, greatly enlarged the possibilities of affective experience for spectators. For example, the monstrosity (and the foolishness) of the Tyrant served to distance the horror of necrophilia at the same time that Govianus's erotic investment in a corporeal corpse brought it closer. So too the multiple personae of the (cross-dressed) Richard Robinson, by subverting the allegorical opposites he represented, served up a titillating compound of holiness, eroticism, and ghoulishness. Throughout the play, in fact, the</page><page sequence="22">236 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN monochromatic representation of the Tyrant provided a kind of ideological constant that in effect obfuscated the play's many invitations to spectators to identify vicariously with the transgressive and the taboo. Still more fundamentally, as I have tried to suggest throughout this essay, early modern metatheatricality unavoidably foregrounded the absence of those indeterminate phenomena that escape the parameters of any system of signification. The Lady might announce herself as spirit, but the actor s body was all too visible (and possibly the same body as that of her corpse). The Song that described the corpse in the chair might warn of putrefaction, but the living body of the boy actor could not pretend to rot. Yet the other- worldly and the generative dead terrify because they are unrepresentable, and this underlying recognition or intuition resonates compellingly in the human subject. Paradoxically, by performing its own failure to represent the corpse as idol, The Second Maiden's Tragedy might well have enabled such epiphanic moments for its audience, and in so doing affirmed the affective power of theatrical spectatorship. Notes 1 . In referring to English "Protestants" and "Protestant reformers" for the purposes of this conceptual summary, I do not mean to imply homogeneity among sects in either doctrine or social agenda, nor to minimize the ideological contestations among Anglican and Puritan leaders. 2. According to Caroline Walker Bynum, who has written extensively on the hermeneutic traditions of medieval Catholicism, the late medieval emphasis on body images was more pre- cisely an emphasis on bodily process. Rather than focus, as did later Protestant reformers, on Christ's relationship to God the Father and on the teleological significance of the Incarnation, Catholicism chose instead to explore the implications of Christ 's humanity. The body of Christ thereby figured as central emblem for the redemptive process, but even more important, the transformative functions of the body itself - such as gestation/birth, consumption/ingestion - were seen as deeply imbricated in Christ's redemptive act. See The Resurrection of the Body in Western Christianity, 200-1336 (New York: Columbia University Press, 1995); Fragmentation and Redemption: Essays on Gender and the Human Body in Medieval Religion (New York: Zone Books, 1991); and Jesus as Mother: Studies in the Spirituality of the High Middle Ages (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1982). 3 . The continuity or relationship between seemingly incongruent states of bodily being - that is, the putrefying corpse and its incorruptible heavenly counterpart - was the subject of elaborate, even tortuous theological speculation during the late Middle Ages. Although main- stream theologians adhered to the doctrine (formally stated by the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215) that every Christian soul rises again with his or her own individual body, interpretations of exactly how this change was transacted varied considerably. Such disputation often focused</page><page sequence="23">Animating Matter 237 on narrowly formulated questions later derided by reformists, such as: will the transfigured body retain its age, height, and gender? will the same matter that originally constituted a body part (for example, a finger) return to the same location? what happens to individuals who are mutilated or eaten? how is a hermaphrodite transfigured? and so forth. Bynum views such literalism as symptomatic of a materialist eschatology affirming "that persons are in some sense their bodies, not merely souls temporarily inhabiting matter" (Fragmentation and Redemption, 224), and that the self should be understood as a "psychosomatic unity" C Resurrection of the Body, 11). 4. The conviction that Catholic obsession with the body tacitly affirmed its autonomous status underlies Protestant opposition to such seemingly disparate phenomena as cosmeti- cized women, relics, and painted statues. For example, the false face of the cosmeticized woman served as a symptom of spiritual confusion by presenting, as it were, a separate persona, one divorced from the natural body but pretending to identify with it. In thus reproducing her face as image, such a woman was, in effect, denying or distorting the ontological status of her natural body. Protestants believed that similar ontological confusions, although in different registers, inevitably resulted from ritual devotion to relics and statues. In hypostatizing these artifacts, Catholics not only confused material signifiers with immaterial entities but also embraced the concept of falsely autonomous, and thereby wholly debased, material bodies. 5. The homily was published as part of The seconde tome ofhomelyes (STC 13663). All references to the text are taken from the 1816 facsimile reprint (4th edition) of Sermons or Homilies appointed to be read in churches in the time of Queen Elizabeth (Oxford: Clarendon Press), 144-225. 6. The influence of Calvin's Institutes is pervasive throughout the homily, and it is noteworthy that at one juncture Calvin pointedly declines to speculate about the disposition of Christians between death and the Last Judgment: "Now it is neither lawful nor expedient to inquire too curiously concerning our souls' intermediate state ... it is foolish and rash to inquire concerning unknown matters more deeply than God permits us to know." See John Calvin, Calvin: Institutes of the Christian Religion, vol. 21, ed. John T. McNeill, trans. Ford Lewis Battles (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, I960), bk. 3, ch. 25, p. 997. For an analysis of the dominance of Calvinist ideology in the English Reformed Church, see P. G. Lake, "Calvin- ism and the English Church 1570-1635," Past and Present 1 14 (February 1987): 32-76. 7. This earlier controversy over images (which figured importantly in William Tyndale's attack on idol worship in the 1 520s) became a cornerstone of iconoclastic polemic. According to the reformers, the decline of religion in the West was precipitated by the papacy's endorsement of ecclesiastical images at the second Council of Nicaea in 787 (the council itself being a belated response to Constantine V's condemnation of such images in 754). In the homily's sensational version of this history, Irene, in league with Rome, ruthlessly exterminated her adversaries, including her son, Constantine VI, after blinding and torturing him. For a summary of the Byzantine precedent as it pertains to the English Reformation, see Margaret Aston, England's Iconoclasts: Laws against Images, vol. 1 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1988), 47-61.

In the one passage (180-83) that directly addresses the issue of imaging Christ, the man/God, the homily either sidesteps the implications of the Incarnation or shifts attention to Christ's divinity. 9.

Dympna Callaghan (Oxford: Blackwell, 2000), 320-38, esp. 323-28. 10. This sexually ambiguous ambience, as Peter Stallybrass has persuasively argued, was a function of the cross-dressed boy actor staging two contradictory fixations or fantasies of sexuality: what was visible and prosthetically suggestive of the "essential" marks of female sexual identity (breasts, vagina); and what was absent and imagined - the body beneath the prosthetic fantasy, which might be imagined as either male or female. Transvestism thereby required the simultaneous awareness of contradictions: it was a presence that spoke of absence.

The connection between sexual experience and death as, in each case, the loss of the individuating self is argued cogently by the anthropologist Georges Bataille, who concludes that "eroticism opens the way to death . . . the ultimate surrender" (Erotism: Death and Sensuality, trans. Mary Dalwood [San Francisco: City Lights Books, 1957], 24). In this context, necrophilia is taboo because it points toward the disturbing relationship between sexuality and physical dissolution as generative forces in the life-death cycle. For a recent study of the subject that is attentive to psychoanalytical theory, see Jonathan Dollimore, Death, Desire, and Loss in Western Culture (New York: Routledge, 1998). 16. For the unlikely possibility that Middleton's corpse was a dummy, see note 41. Other plays that prop up the actor/corpse in a chair to be worshiped include Chapman's Monsieur d'Olive (1604-5) and Massinger's The Duke of Milan (1621-22), the latter closely modeling its final scene after that of The Second Maiden's Tragedy There are, in addition, many plays - such as Chettle and Munday's The Death of Robert Earl of Huntington (1597-98), John Marston's Sophonisba (1605), and Middleton's (?) The Revenger's Tragedy (1607) - that feature corpses as idols with less pronounced or sustained necrophiliac overtones. Although representations of dead idols could be manipulated, as did Shakespeare and Webster, so as</page><page sequence="25">Animating Matter 239 to tap profoundly unsettling emotions in viewers (see, for example, Zimmerman, "Duncan's Corpse," esp. 328-35), most Jacobean dramatists did not exploit the theatrical potential of the corpse in nuanced ways. 17. Historically, there were three Herods who were often conflated in legend: Herod the Great, king of Judea; Herod Antipas, tetrarch of Jerusalem, the son of Herod the Great by his fourth wife; and Herod Agrippa, grandson of Herod the Great and his first wife, Miriam. See Maurice J. Valency, The Tragedies of Herod and Mariamne (New York: Columbia University Press, 1940), 33; and Barry Weiler and Margaret W. Ferguson, eds., Elizabeth Cary's The Tragedy of Mariam, The Fair Queen of Jewry (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1994), 20-22. 18. These texts, originally written in Aramaic, were among the first in the Renaissance to be printed in Greek, Latin, and numerous vernaculars, and were translated into English by Thomas Lodge in 1602. For a summation of Josephus's account of Herod, see Weiler and Ferguson, Tragedy of Mariam, 19-20. 19. In patristic commentary, Josephus's graphic description of Herod's fatal illness became the basis for increasingly elaborate versions of his death. That such exegetical additions to the legend of Herod were well known during the English Reformation can be seen in the reference to Herod's death in An Homily against Excess of Apparel: " [God] overthrew Herod, who in his royal apparel, forgetting God, was smitten of an angel, and eaten up of worms" C Sermons or Homilies , 262). 20. This passage reads, "He preserved her body in honey for seven years. Some say that he had intercourse with her, others that he did not. According to those who say that he had intercourse with her, his reason for embalming her was to justify his desires. According to those who say that he did not have intercourse with her, his reason was that people might say that he had married a king's daughter" (I. Epstein, ed., Baba Bathra I [London: Soncino Press, I960], 3b). In the Talmud (but not in any of the accounts of Josephus), Mariamne kills herself after Herod's accusations of adultery. For a discussion of the influence of Jewish texts on Renaissance biblical scholarship, especially in England, see Debora Kuller Shuger, The Renaissance Bible: Scholarship, Sacrifice, and Subjectivity (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1994), esp. 33-36. 21. In plays from the Chester, Coventry, York, and Towneley cycles, Herod himself is prone to self-referential monologues praising his beauty and boasting of his power. See Rosemary Woolf, The English Mystery Plays (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1972), 203-4. 22. For the progressive development of Herod as a farcical figure in the mystery plays, see Roscoe E. Parker, "The Reputation of Herod in Early English Literature," Speculum 8 (1933): 59-67; and especially David Staines, "To Out-Herod Herod: The Development of a Dramatic Character," in Clifford Davidson et al., eds., The Drama of the Middle Ages: Comparative and Critical Essays (New York: AMS Press, 1982), 207-31. It is also possible that well- known iconographie features of Herod - physical deformity, the cross-legged stance of the madman, the black face of the Saracen - were used in performances (both medieval and early modern) to undermine or demonize Herod's preeminence as king. See Penelope B. R. Doob, Nebuchadnezzar's Children: Conventions of Madness in Middle English Literature (New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1974), 109.</page><page sequence="26">240 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN 23. In her illuminating study, Tragedies of Tyrants: Political Thought and Theater in the English Renaissance (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1990), Rebecca W Bushnell situates "the Vice [as] the Tyrant s double" within the tradition of "moral ambidexterousness" characteristic of medieval drama: "the tyrant's discontinuity implies a lack of coherence in the moral universe that his grotesque figure has come to dominate" (96-98, passim). 24. Although The Second Maiden's Tragedy has been attributed to at least six dramatists, most scholars identify Tourneur and Middleton as the most likely candidates. In her edition of the play (Manchester: Manchester University Press; and Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1978), Anne Lancashire argues that the preponderance of evidence favors Middleton (15-23), and the play is scheduled for inclusion in the forthcoming Oxford edition of Middleton s collected works. The only early modern text of the play is a manuscript (included in Lansdowne, 807, ff.29-36), presumably a promptbook for a performance by the King's Men (at Blackfriars?) in l6l 1 , the date of the license on the last page of text in the autograph of Sir George Bue, Master of the Revels from I6O8 to 1622. Because, as Bue says, the manuscript "hath no name inscribed," Bue supplied the title himself along with at least two corrections to the text. Five addition slips to the manuscript are in the hand of the primary scribe; there are two or more additional correctors, including Bue and a hand that appears to be that of the playhouse reviser. The manuscript contains numerous alterations and excisions, none demonstrably authorial in origin. See Lancashire, Second Maiden's Tragedy, 1-15, and Appendix A, 261-85. All references to the play are taken from Lancashire's edition. 25. The passage from Josephus reads: "And at this time in the night season accompanied only with his most trustie friends, being verie warie that none of the people should know of it, he entred into the Sepulchre . . . After the Sepulchre was thus violated, Herods house began to decay ..." (Flavius Josephus, Of the Antiquities of the Jews, trans. Thomas Lodge [London: 1602], 26.1 1.423; quoted in Lancashire, Second Maiden's Tragedy, 295). 26. These lines are marked for excision in the manuscript by an unknown hand. 27. The subplot, which serves as ostensible foil to the central action, features another sexual triangle in which Votarius, friend of Anselmus, agrees to test the chastity of Anselmus's Wife, who succumbs to temptation. The adultery of Votarius and the Wife, together with the illicit affair of the Wife's waiting woman, leads to the deaths (in a single scene) of all five lovers. The "flesh-market" (1.2.272) ambience of the subplot, its successive adulteries and betrayals, contrasts pointedly with the self-sacrifice of the chaste Lady, and functions, at least on one level, so as to throw her virtue into relief. Lancashire contends that the primary source of the subplot is an adaptation of the story of the Curious Impertinent in part 1 of Cervantes's Don Quixote (1605), first printed in English in 1612 and possibly circulating in manuscript prior to that date ( Second Maiden's Tragedy, 30-32). It is noteworthy, however, that Herod's temptation of Mariamne in similar circumstances, described by Josephus m Antiquities and The Jewish War and appropriated by Massinger for The Duke of Milan, was a well-known part of the Herod legend. 28. Lancashire is herself in this tradition. On the basis of a large compendium of materials, she argues that the play is heavily larded with references to saints' lives (her most persuasive case is made for Sophronia, whose literary history reaches from Eusebius to Foxe), and to the life of Christ. In Lancashire's view, the cumulative weight of these allusions suggests that the</page><page sequence="27">Animating Matter 241 Lady functions as a Christ figure, a "Jacobean," or "secular" saint. For her discussion of saints' lives, see introduction to Second Maiden's Tragedy, 23-30, esp. 25-27; and "The Second Maidens Tragedy: A Jacobean Saint's Life," Review of English Studies, n.s., 25, no. 99 (August 1974): 267-79, esp. 270-76. Although my own work on this play has led to quite different conclusions, I am greatly indebted to Lancashire for her editorial commentary, and for her meticulous research in identifying the wide range of contemporary texts that may have served as sources or analogues for the play. 29. From a postmodern standpoint, the disjunction between allegorical framework and ambiguity of representation is implicit in the formal structure of allegory itself. That is, allegor- ical oppositions misrepresent the relationship of their signifiers (good/evil) as independent of each other, whereas binary oppositions are distinctively interdependent - each signifier can be understood only in relation to the other. Thus allegory (like language itself) would guarantee an intelligibility that its signifiers deny. Interestingly, when The Second Maiden 's Tragedy is viewed through this theoretical lens, its allegorical absolutes seem in deliberate tension with its ambiguous representations, so that it may be said that both the conscious and the unconscious of the text challenge its structural framework. 30. The contributions of stagecraft to the confusion of these personae are taken up later. 3 1 . Bushnell's description of the symbiotic relationship between king and tyrant is relevant here: "the image of the king is unimaginable without his reflection in the tyrant . . . the differ- ence between king and tyrant . . . always . . . threatens to collapse into identity" ( Tragedies of Tyrants, 22). 32. The religious controversy over the moral legitimacy of suicide as a means of forestalling rape is elided in this play. Govianus raises no objection to the Lady's decision to kill herself in act 3, scene 1, although he does express disapproval of the Wife's presumed suicide after the exposure of her adultery in act 5, scene 1. 33- These sentiments echo those of the Lady prior to her suicide, when she assures Govianus that her death will put her beyond the reaches of the Tyrant: His lust may part me from thee, but death, never; Thou canst not lose me there, for, dying thine, Thou dost enjoy me still. Kings cannot rob thee. (3.1.144-46) 34. Some references (or assumed references) to Catholicism have been excised from the manuscript, although in most instances it is difficult to know why. For example, allusions to Catholic doctrine (such as the ones to Purgatory [2.1.1 56-57] and to the Virgin's Assumption and Coronation [5.2.195-205]) might have been viewed as unwelcome reminders of still popular beliefs, and/or as gratuitously offensive to Catholic spectators. Moreover, several of the excised passages were probably objectionable on other grounds as well: in act 5, scene 2, the crowning of the Lady's corpse by Govianus after his murder of the Tyrant had disturbing political implications quite apart from the iconography of the Virgin Mary as Queen. It is well to remember in this connection that Bue s is the only hand in the manuscript that can be confidently identified as the work of a censor, and that Bue made only two corrections (see</page><page sequence="28">242 SUSAN ZIMMERMAN note 24). Nonetheless, the preponderance of manuscript cuts does suggest (as do Buc's) an effort to remove passages that might be construed as critical of the Jacobean court. For a classification of manuscript alterations by topic, see Lancashire, Second Maiden's Tragedy, Appendix A, esp. 280. 35. My term is a paraphrase from Bushnell's description of Seneca's tyrant (34). However, Bushnell's analysis of Plato's tyrant, "a man who gives free rein to desire" (13), seems particularly relevant to Middleton's protagonist (see 9-29), as do certain passages from The Republic itself, such as the following: "There is a dangerous, wild, and lawless form of desire in everyone. ... It doesn't shrink from trying to have sex with a mother, as it supposes, or with anyone else at all, whether man, god, or beast" ( Plato/Republic , trans. G. M. A. Grube, rev. C. D. C. Reeve [Indianapolis: Hackett, 1992]: ix, 572b, 571d, 78). 36. Even the Lady herself is metonymically described as an eye: "for where she goes / Her eye removes the court" (1.1.147-48). 37. In the tomb scenes (act 4, scenes 2 and 3) as well as elsewhere in the play, Middleton interpolates comedy at moments of great dramatic tension (as do the medieval Herod plays). Here, the Tyrant's despoliation of the tomb takes place amid the bawdy protests of his incredulous soldiers, which partially neutralize the Tyrant's necrophiliac threat: Tyr. Take up her body. 1 Sol. How, my lord! Tyr: Her body! 1 Sol. She's dead, my lord! Tyr. True, if she were alive, Such slaves as you should not come near to touch her. Do't, and with all best reverence; place her here. 1 Sol. Not only sir, with reverence, but with fear. You shall have more than your own asking once. 1 am afraid of nothing but she'll rise At the first jog, and save us all a labour. 2 Sol. Then we were best take her up and never touch her! 1 Sol. Life, how can that be? Does fear make thee mad? I've took up many a woman in my days, But never with less pleasure, I protest! (4.3.68-79) In general, the Tyrant's imagery in opening the tomb exploits the sexual implications of forcible violation ("Pierce the jaws / Of this cold, ponderous creature" [25-26]), language which the soldiers echo irreverently ("This is ten thousand times worse than ent'ring upon a breach. / 'Tis the first stone that ever I took off / From any lady . . . [56-58]). 38. Prior to this critical juncture, the Tyrant's erotic ministrations have gradually become more resolute, as has his apotheosis of the Lady's body: Madam! 'Tis I, sweet lady. Prithee speak! 'Tis thy love calls on thee- thy king, thy servant.</page><page sequence="29">Animating Matter 243 No? Not a word? All prisoners to pale silence? I'll prove a kiss. (4.3.86-89) Since thy life has left me, I'll clasp the body for the spirit that dwelt in't, And love the house still for the mistress' sake. Thou art mine now, spite of destruction And Govianus, and I will possess thee. (4.3.110-14) 39. For an insightful analysis of early modern poisonous cosmetics as signifiers of "the inseparability of external from internal, of material from immaterial," see Tanya Pollard, "Beauty's Poisonous Properties," Shakespeare Studies 27 (1999): 188, 187-210. 40. The notation "ENTER LADY / RICH ROBINSON" appears alongside the stage direction for the apparition scene (act 4, scene 4). Lancashire (following the suggestion of W. W. Greg) contends that only actors of minor or doubled parts were customarily cited by name in promptbooks. In this instance, the manuscript notation for "Lady" at the first appearance of the ghost "make[s] clear that the actor who played the Lady was also to play her spirit" (see note to S.D.4 2.2-3 222-23). Lancashire suggests further that Robinson may have played the Wife, but this is unlikely since it would have required an interlude between the end of act 3, when the Lady is still on stage, and the beginning of act 4, when the Wife enters ( Second Maiden's Tragedy, 5.5). 4 1 . The stage directions do not make clear who (or what) represented the corpse. Although the staging of a similar scene in The Duke of Milan allowed for the same actor who played the living woman to represent her corpse, thereby providing continuity of image, this option would seem less likely here because of Robinson's dual role as Lady and ghost, and the presence of both ghost and corpse on stage at the end of the play. However, I think it possible, even likely, that in act 5, scene 2, Robinson appeared as corpse rather than as ghost. It seems curious that the ghost has only one and a half lines (163-64), after which the actor presumably exited (there is no stage direction) and did not reappear to "to go out with the body " (S.D. 205. 1-2) until immediately before the end of the play. The corpse, on the other hand, and especially the face of the corpse, was the center of attention throughout the scene. If the body in the chair was Robinson's, then presumably he also represented the corpse in act 4, scene 3, the tomb scene with the Tyrant preceding the first apparition of the Lady as ghost in act 4, scene 4. It is also possible (although I think much less likely) that in both scenes the corpse was a dummy, an alternative which would have altered the erotic frisson of the Tyrant's lovemaking while emphasizing (albeit from another direction) the artifice of theatrical performance.</page></plain_text>
