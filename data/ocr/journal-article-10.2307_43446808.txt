Among readers of the divine poems in particular this intemperate temperament has become an object of controversy . Qual- ities that made Donne a love poet of sublime egotism also, for some critics, damaged his religious verse irreparably; "The 'Holy Sonnets' and the 'Hymns,' " argues a suspicious Douglas Bush, "are focused, like the love poems, on a particular moment and situation, on John Donne, and the rest of life and the world is blacked out, does not exist."1 Moreover, the agoraphobic playfulness and unrelieved ingenuity so appealing in the context of human love have seemed less suitable to the doctrines of the Christian faith. It is one thing to run circles of wit about the straight-line orthodoxy of Petrarchan love poets, quite another to bend the cherished corners of dogma. Poems such as "Batter my heart" and "Show me deare Christ" may appear desperately inventive, the work of a histrionic convert who "has to stimulate his awareness of God by dwelling on the awfulness of God."2 Like other Renaissance poets whose devotional verse has been assailed, Donne has been defended by scholars assuming (however im- plicitly) that negative evaluations are directed, whether by ignorance or design, against the religion itself. Louis Martz and Helen Gardner, locating a tradition of formal meditation intended to achieve sensual immediacy, interior drama, and intense emotion, have disarmed objections by subtly disarming the poems, revealing those idiosyncratic, "tasteless" moments in l.

Something is asked of us we can no longer easily give. Many of the Holy Sonnets have this perilous balance; their wit is always likely to seem indelicate as well as passionate."4 The "we" of this passage is more just than it might first appear, for the great ambivalent power of Donne's sonnet depends on how, as the marital conceit develops toward holy adultery, the "me" of the first line becomes the "our sights" and "most men" of the sestet, thus implicating readers in the express desire to woo the spouse of Christ.5 The poem has been designed to force "us" to participate in the alarming extension of a traditional metaphor. Drawn into uneasy complicity with the speaker, readers may find the "glorious difference" less compelling than the inglorious similarity. The Ignatian exercises evoked to explain these violations of taste are in reality one minor consequence of the major theological problem of an- thropomorphism. As we cannot conceive of God except in terms con- ceivable to a human mind, our apprehension of a timeless, infinite, un- searchably wise deity must be anthropomorphic to one degree or another - as, arguably, must all our apprehensions. On the one hand, anthropo- morphism would seem to be a fundamental human instinct to make this world comfortable, familiar, explicable, and responsive, appropriate in nature to be the object of both our feelings and our thoughts. Such a postulate might account, to choose a trivial example, for the acceptably "normal" behavior permitted the pet owner in our civilized culture, who may name, fondle, dress, and bury his beast, even engage the brute in imaginary conversation ("That's a good boy!") without fear of seeming 3.

Considered ge- nerically, as permissible expressions of our abiding loneliness, there is an unsettling brotherhood between the pet owner projecting his humanity downward in the hierarchy of being to his dog and the religious man pro- jecting his humanity upward to his God, addressing his deity as his "father" or "king." Yet we would err in assuming that this brotherhood is anything but universal. Anthropomorphism, though involved with the unique needs of individuals, may represent the inherent condition of per- ception itself. Men have so often found, even in the most precise endeavors of the mind, that they gaze in a mirror while supposing themselves to observe the world. A case in point from the early decades of this century would be the conviction of molecular physicists such as Eddington and Pauli that the indeterminate position of an electron had solved definitively the ancient debate between free will and determinism; their confusion between the "choice" of quantum orbits and the ethical "choice" of hu- man beings was, as Cassirer realized immediately, based on the imputation of a gross anthropomorphism to an electron.6 Despite the exposure of this and similar misconceptions, the human intellect cannot be expected to ward off forever the specter of its own operations. Thinkers seep into their own thoughts and we are, sometimes unknowingly, the objects of our own intelligence. Egotism, as skeptics both ancient and modern have always hoped to remind us with their array of stunning fallacies, is an attribute of knowing: we must believe what we know and much of what we know is essentially solipsistic. The Nobel physicist P. W. Bridgman, considering the apparatus of perception, has drawn the radically skeptical conclusion that progress in molecular physics will soon be at an end, since the human mind is not so constituted that it may think accurately about the physical world.7 So perhaps we are blind in the very act of seeing. Christian theologians debated similar issues, distinguishing anthropo- morphism as the emotional need of individual believers from anthropo- morphism as the necessary condition of theological knowledge. Recog- nizing the two directions implied by this discrimination, we may draw a useful line between those rational beings who keep always before them the difference between God as he is known and God as he is, and those more 6.

It is precisely the trespass of this fine line that complicates our response to "Show me deare Christ." For what disturbs Kermode, and what has disturbed critics of "Batter my heart," is Donne's eagerness to display the most anthropo- morphic consequences of anthropomorphism - in short, to imagine with some detail the sexuality of God. Approving the theological tenor, we suspect the anthropomorphic vehicle. Perhaps the Ignatian exercises, with their extraordinary reliance on the power of corporeal images, promoted unsettling formulations of this kind. But these impressive poems appro- priately raise the larger question of how and why Donne thought of man while thinking of God. By outlining the history of Christian accommodation and attending to its psychological implications, I hope to appreciate the strategy of these two sonnets, clarifying both the logic which informs them and the am- bivalence which they inspire. I. ACCOMMODATION The problem of anthropomorphism was made acute for Christianity by the key doctrine of the inspired Scriptures. One sacred book held to con- tain all truth, every word used with full awareness of its connection to every other word - the tradition of Christian theology is, from this per- spective, literary criticism of immense complexity, offering its own solu- tions to issues that have engaged the expositors of our own, relatively unseasoned discipline. Much of this literary speculation centered upon the intractably anthropomorphic character of the Bible and confronted, in this context, the relationship between the real and the fictive. One history of Christian theology might be plotted as the tension between limiting scriptural anthropomorphism as strictly as possible and licensing wor- shipers to pursue these inspired metaphors with full imaginative commit- ment. Excluding the simple anthropomorphism of various medieval sects, this history will be concerned largely with degrees of emphasis. Even Aquinas granted that God must be predicated with "life" and "personality," since it would be harrowing to suppose that the emotions invested in God, such as trust and love, were being presented to an impersonal force.8 Augustine understood the anthropomorphic passages of Scripture as 8.

His remarks, like those of later commentators, pertain to the "anger" of God in the Old Testament. We are not to imagine that God is angry as a man is angry: "But if Scripture were not to use such expressions ... it would not famil- iarly insinuate itself into the m inds of all classes of men, whom it seeks to reach for their good, that it may alarm the proud, arouse the careless, exercise the inquisitive, and satisfy the intelligent; and this it could not do, did it not first stoop, and in a manner descend, to them where they lie."9 The Holy Spirit condescends for purposes of persuasion, speaking anthro- pomorphically in much the way a man, stooping to an infant, will imi- tate baby talk. These remarks, concerned entirely with rhetorical motive, represent a proud apology rather than a linguistic philosophy, and one which should be placed against that other traditional excuse for the parabolic nature of Scripture - hiding the truth from impure readers by deliberate obscurity.10 As Old Testament prophecies of the Messiah, who would assume a true human form, were expressed in mysterious language, so the mysterious essence of the Father, who would remain a truly in- human form, was expressed in simple language. For Aquinas the problems associated with anthropomorphism were more philosophical than rhetorical and the correct interpretation of ac- commodated speech became the central issue of theology. He argued that all words predicated of God are, in one sense, improperly predicated: "... every name is defective. For by means of a name we express a thing in the way in which the intellect conceives it As a result, with reference to the mode of signification there is in every name that we use an imper- fection, which does not befit God, even though the thing signified in some eminent way does befit God. For we cannot grasp what God is, but only what He is not and how other things are related to Him. . . ."n On the basis of this passage it would be misleading to suggest that all propositions about God must be either negative or metaphorical. Though no predicate can be meant univocally of man and God, attributes such as "intellect," "reason," and "free will," all of which Aquinas believes "proper" to God, are to be understood as "real" with respect to God. Such attributes in man 9. The City of God xv.xxiv, trans. Marcus Dodds (New York, 1950), p. 515. 10. Ernst Robert Curtius, in European Literature in the Latin Middle Ages , trans.

Whereas anthropomorphism formulates a crude equation, Aquinas dis- assembled that blunt metaphor into many similes, discussing for each case the similarities and dissimilarities between our human "mode of significa- tion" and the divine "thing signified." Accommodation should elicit, not the gift of human emotions to an imaginary "human" deity, but a grandly dispassionate exercise of intelligence: "[This refutes] the simple Jews, Tertullian, the Audian or Anthropomorphite heretics, who endowed God with a bodily figure. . . . The occasion of all these errors was that, in think- ing of divine things, men were made the victims of their imagination, through which it is not possible to receive anything except the likeness of a body. This is why, in meditating on what is incorporeal, we must stop fol- lowing the imagination."13 The God of Augustine made a gracious "de- scent" into anthropomorphism hoping to reach the human imagination, to "satisfy the intelligent" as well as "arouse the careless." Reaching back toward God with all his thought, Aquinas transferred names from this corporeal world to an incorporeal being: as God accommodated himself to man, so man must assimilate himself to God. With small distortion Aquinas' propositions concerning God may be described as a brilliant and deliberate reversal of the embarrassment of accommodation. Given their distaste for Catholic "idolatry" and their sympathy for icon- oclasm, one would expect Protestant theologians to express some reticence about the virtues of accommodated speech. Certainly that is true of Calvin, for whom the gift of accommodation did not in any way mitigate our inability, because of the Fall, to comprehend a supra-rational deity: For because our weakness does not attain to his exalted state, the description of him that is given to us must be accommodated to our capacity so that we may understand it. Now the mode of accommodation is for him to represent himself to us not as he is in himself, but as he seems to us. Although he is beyond all disturbance of mind, yet he testifies that he is angry toward sinners. Therefore whenever we hear that God is angered, we ought not to imagine any emotion in him, but rather to consider that this expression has been taken from our own human experience; because God, whenever he is exercising judg- ment, exhibits the appearance of one kindled and angered.14 12.

We are told that God is "angry" so that "our weakness" may imagine him, yet "we ought not to imagine any emotion in him." What we are offered is what we are denied: the traditional position has been pushed toward Orwellian double- think. In the visual arts we discover the literal consequences of this caution. Those celestial courts, God the King surrounded by angelic courtiers, which adorn the upper halves of Northern and Italian Renaissance paint- ings, etchings, and altar designs, disappear in the biblical illustrations of a Rembrandt. Baptized in a Calvinist church and perhaps a convert in his maturity to the Mennonite sect, Rembrandt portrayed sacred events solely within the discrete context of history, avoiding subjects such as the Last Judgment which would require, by nature and by tradition, the representation of God as a human figure.15 Protestants adopted the Cath- olic genre of the emblem book, which encouraged an anthropomorphism of traditional synecdoches - a divine hand reaching from the clouds, a vigilant eye in place of the sun.16 But with the general movement of Protestant art from the church to the home of the patron came a new restraint in the delineation of the incorporeal Godhead. Although Dürer, whose religious allegiances shifted late in life from Erasmus to Luther, delineated the divine figure on several occasions, although Holbein in- in relation to Christian men. Understandably, then, God spoke to them with "similes fuerunt pueris" ( Institutes n.vii.ii). This metaphor was derived ultimately from St. Paul, especially Gal. 3.24. See also Institutes i.xi.iii, n.xi.ii. Accommodation was a particularly knotty issue for Calvin because of his uncompromising view of the divine inspiration of Scripture.

This rejection of Catholic iconography expresses the concern of Protestant theologians to repudiate superstitious "images" and to reaffirm in exegesis the sensus historicus.17 Yet in Protestant literature we find the devotional anthropomorphism of Donne, Herbert, and Vaughan on the Anglican right and, further to the left, the conceited lyrics of American Puritans such as Philip Pain and Edward Taylor. We find as well the persistently accommodated portrait of God in Paradise Lost . Milton, who would not divide matter from spirit, was far less circumspect than Calvin about the corporeal metaphors of Scripture in his De Doctrina Christiana : ... let us believe that it is not beneath the dignity of God to grieve in that for which he is grieved, or to be refreshed in that which refresheth him, or to fear in that he feareth. For however we may attempt to soften down such expressions by a latitude of interpreta- tion, when applied to the Deity, it comes in the end to precisely the same. . . . and if God habitually assign to himself the members and form of man, why should we be afraid of attributing to him what he attributes to himself, so long as what is imperfect and weakness when viewed in reference to ourselves be considered as most complete and excellent when imputed to God? Questionless the glory and majesty of the Deity must have been so dear to him, that he would never say anything of himself which could be humiliating or degrading, and would ascribe to himself no personal attributes which he would not willingly have ascribed to him by his creatures. . . . In a word, God either is, or is not, such as he represents himself to be. If he be really such, why should we think otherwise of him? If he be not such, on what authority do we say what God has not said? If it be his Will that we should thus think of him, why does our imagination wander into some other conception? Why should we hesitate to con- ceive of God according to what he has not hesitated to declare explicitly respecting himself?18 These defiant questions challenge the traditional reluctance to imagine God. There is nothing here of either the scorn of Aquinas or the strict qualifications of Calvin. "Why should we hesitate. . . ?" Milton asks. We may allow our imaginations to be stimulated by accommodated speech "so long as what is imperfect and weakness when viewed in reference to 17.

For Milton the understanding and construction of accommodated language require an act of moral reorientation. Human imperfection, when imagined as "complete and excellent," will become commensurate with divine perfection. Whereas accommodation denigrates the human in Calvin, it elevates the human in Milton. By descending into anthropo- morphism God both honored mankind and endorsed the faculty of imagination. Within Protestantism itself this liberal position derives from Martin Luther. Despite recent scholarship suggesting that Luther welcomed ec- clesiastical art, there is little in his writings to indicate an enthusiastic ap- preciation for the visual mode. He defended religious images (the crucifix, Madonna, and hagiographical portrait, primarily) against the iconoclastic excesses of Karlstadt (Andreas Bodenstein), but pallidly: art might be instructive, insofar as it reiterated sound doctrine, once all idolatrous images had been shattered in the heart.19 In his commentaries on Genesis, however, Luther presented an energetic defense of anthropomorphic speech against all charges of impropriety. Indeed, he went so far as to absolve the Anthropomorphite sect of heresy: A papal decree condemns the Anthropomorphites for speaking about God as if they were speaking about a human being, and for ascribing to Him eyes, ears, arms, etc. How- ever, the condemnation is unjust. Indeed, how could men speak otherwise of God among men? If it is heresy to think of God in this manner, then a verdict has been rendered concerning the salvation of all children, who think and speak of God in this childlike fashion. But even apart from the children: give me the most learned doctor - how else will he teach and speak about God? And so a wrong was done to good men. . . . How can this nature of ours understand the spiritual essence of God? Scripture, too, here and there makes use of this very manner of speech. Therefore they were unjustly condemned. Their zeal for simplicity should rather be commended as something supremely necessary in doctrinal matters. When God reveals Himself to us, it is necessary for Him to do so through some such veil or wrapper and to say: "Look! Under this wrapper you will be sure to take hold of Me." When we embrace this wrapper, adoring, praying, and sacrificing to God there, we are said to be praying to God and sacrificing to Him properly.20 19.

His evangelical fervor demanded a "zeal for simplicity": the Word, after all, was sufficient. Thus he recognized accommodation as the beneficent gift of the Holy Spirit, essential to the devotional lives of learned doctors as well as naive children. The veil was to be embraced, not thrown aside, for through accommodation the Holy Spirit had prescribed the most efficacious forms of human worship. Directing its suspicions largely against anthropomorphism appealing to the eye, the Lutheran strain of Reforma- tion theology provided justification enough for anthropomorphism of the word. This new enthusiasm for accommodated speech has psychological as well as aesthetic implications. Accommodation is the open door between religion and psychoanalysis, the point where rational theology yields knowingly and decisively to subjective artifice. Liberal formulations of this principle, emphasizing participation rather than restraint, license each believer to pursue his salvation within the terms of an earthly drama - to establish a crucial dialogue with some figure from his own psyche. The nature of God is a dispute of reason; but the exact configuration of an anthropomorphic prayer or poem represents, by definition, the conscious fiction of a religious mind. Ernest Jones has written that "all the numerous mental attitudes that man has at different times displayed toward his various gods - love, hate, dread, adoration, awe, yearning, helplessness, exaltation - are without exception copies or derivatives of corresponding feelings he has at an earlier age experienced, consciously or unconsciously, towards his parents or their substitutes."21 Though he wishes to preserve "the holy" as a distinct and apriori category of human experience, Rudolf Otto arrives at a conclusion remarkably close to that of the psycho- analyst: ". . . the phrase 'We ought to fear, love, and trust him' is verbally identical, whether it refers to the relation of child to father or to that of man to God. But again in the second case these ideas are infused with a meaning of which none but the religious-minded man can have any comprehension or indeed any inkling, whose presence makes . . . the Tear of God' 'something more' than any fear of a man, qualitatively, not merely quantitatively, though retaining the essence of the most genuine 21.

The search for salvation, then, is concurrently the search for loving approval from the human characters of a special and uniquely profound kind of fantasy - the devotional life. Thus George Herbert, for example, often conceives of God as a "father" or "lord," himself as a "child" or "servant." In poem after poem he strains to win the love of this master by elegant praise, exaggerated shame, self-inflicted suffering, or, these failing, by calculated blasphemy. To his patient God these frantic efforts seem ironic and unnecessary, foolish elaborations of the uncomplicated pre- requisites for love. Herbert's many intricate artifices in praise of artlessness suggest his anxious need to seek the love of God before he can rest, con- vinced once more that love merely is, wonderful and undeserved, his like an inherited treasure.23 If the devotions of this poet, fatherless at four, express anxieties common to childhood, John Milton's choice of ac- commodated terms was rooted more immediately in his adult experience. The man who had once intended to write an epic celebrating King Arthur, a subject deeply connected through Spenser and the Tudor historians with the celebration of the English monarchy, came eventually to sign the death warrant of Charles I. His great epic celebrated the God of all creation as an accommodated "King," speaking the royal "we," commanding attendant angels, enjoying festival masques, fielding an army to win a civil war, and generating policy to thwart the intrigues of Satan: Milton translated his literary ambitions to eternity, where heavenly politics were the reverse mirror image of earthly politics. Surely John Donne did not accommodate God as the "lover" in a marital triangle with the frequency that Herbert wrote of his "lord" or Milton of his "sovereign," but the poems expressing this metaphor have a comparable intensity.24 The drama 22.

In the tradition of Luther, Donne the preacher exhibited obvious delight in the imaginative consequences of accommodation. Excoriating the sins of pride, he undertook a curious digression proving that God, who is "often by the Holy Ghost invested, and represented in the qualities and affections of man" in order "to constitute a familiarity and commerce between man and God," never once submitted to the Satanic vice of pride.25 God did, however, accept some other deadly ones, appearing in various passages of the Bible as slothful, prodigal, angry, vindictive, and drunk. Whenever "those inordinate and irregular passions and perturba- tions, excesses and defects of man, are imputed to God," it is solely "for the better applying of God to the understanding of man" (n, 288). But this "better applying" made God terrible even as it rendered Him compre- hensible. Preaching on the "terrible things" of Psalm 65.5, Donne argued that to preserve the "stupendious, reverend, mysterious" aspects of wor- ship, the Holy Spirit called us "to all Acts, and Exercises of Religion" with fearful obscurity; "terrible things" include both the promises of judgment and the "Visions" or "Similitudes" of the Bible that convey these promises (vii, 314). The Christian knowledge of God, "a nearer approximation" than that of any other religion, dazzles beyond mere love: "And therefore, the love of God, which is so often proposed unto us, is as often seasoned with the feare of God; nay, all our Religious affections are reduced to that one, To a reverentiall feare; If he be a Master, he cals for feare, and, If he be a Father, he calls for honour , and honour implies a reverentiall feare" (vii, 316). In effect, Donne has annihilated any distinction between the deliber- ate obscurity of prophetic visions and the deliberate simplicity of anthro- pomorphic metaphors. Both sorts of biblical language require, in his summary phrase, "an awfull discrimination of Divine things from Civili" (vii, 316). The transference of temporal words to an eternal deity compels all Christians to "make a difference" (vn, 314) in the meanings of those words. Yet from the convergence of familiar and divine significance arises "a reverentiall feare" that seasons all our "Religious affections." of religious poetry" (p. 177). "Batter my heart" and "Show me deare Christ" differ from the "amatory tradition" mostly in the extent of their accommodation. It is the difference between elegant courtship and forthright proposition. 25. The Sermons of John Donne , ed. George Potter and Evelyn Simpson (10 vols.; Berkeley, 1953-62), ii, 288. Hereafter quotations from the Sermons are cited in my text by volume and page.</page><page sequence="13">William Kerrigan 349 The consequences of this association between scriptural metaphor and reverent fear may be traced throughout the Sermons. Unquestionably Donne enjoyed imitating the "third heavens of hyperboles" he so admired in the Bible. Addressing God in his Devotions , he wrote: "all profane authors seem of the seed of the serpent that creeps, thou art the Dove that flies."26 But there was a terror in this appreciation. Often he wrenched his exegesis in the direction of the awesome, the unimaginable, the forbidden. He contrived, in a tone somewhere between delight and dread, the "awful discrimination" of the human from the divine. Thus Donne on Jeremiah 9.1: "It was God that was their Father, and it is God, their God that slew them; but yet, that God, their Father weepes over the slaughter. So in the person of Esay, God weepes again, I will bewaile thee with weeping, and I will water thee with teares. ... As though God as contracted an Irregu- larity, by having to do in a cause of blood, He sighs, he weeps when he must draw blood from them" (vii, 243). The passage winds up grief to a mysteriousness. Choosing to recognize God as a "Father" at this moment, Donne formulates an "irregular" situation - a father who, having mur- dered his children, mourns and vows revenge. Yet Donne remains well aware that his propositions cannot mean what, seemingly, they must mean. "As though God had contracted an Irregularity. . . ." It was left the congregation to "make a difference" between perverse human grief and impeccable divine grief. The accommodated metaphor which Donne presented with unique force was that of God as lover or loved one. "God is Love , and the Holy Ghost is amorous in his Metaphors " (vn, 87). He was most amorous, of course, in the Song of Songs. Luther, though careful to distinguish the historical from the allegorical sense, complimented the ancient interpreta- tion of this book as the spiritual courtship of Christ and the church. The notion was "delightful," "ingenious and full of comfort": "Let those who want to devise allegories follow this lead. . . ."27 Taking this advice, Donne found a brother in the example of Solomon: "... Solomon, whose disposition was amorous, and excessive in the love of women, when he turn'd to God, He departed not utterly from his old phrase and language, but having put a new, and spiritual tincture, and form and habit into all his thoughts, he conveys all his loving approaches and applications to God, and all Gods gracious answers to his amorous soul, into songs, and Epithalamions, and meditates upon contracts, and marriages between 26.

Of the many passages of 4 'old phrase and language" in the sermons of this re- formed lover, the most revealing is the sermon of 1621 on Psalm 2.12, "Kisse the Son, lest he be angry." Now, the sanctification of a kiss in scriptural metaphor might not seem so bold an accommodation. Earthly experience, as we know, offers numerous instances of the asexual kiss - the sisterly, the chaste, the hurried - and Donne began by admitting that a lustless kiss was, in biblical times, a sign of deference to authority. Yet in order that his text be as disquieting as possible, Donne soon dropped the Psalmist's kiss into the depths of lewdness: They mistake the matter much, that thinke all adultery is below the girdle: A man darts out adultery with his eye, in a wanton look; and he wraps up adultery with his fingers, in a wanton letter; and he breaths in an adultery with his lips, in a wanton kisse. But though this act of love, be so defamed both wayes, by treachery, by licentiousness, Yet God chooses this Metaphore, he bids us Kisse the Sonne. It is a true, and an usefull Rule, that ill men have been Types of Christ, and ill actions figures of good: Much more, may things not ill in themselves, though deflected and distorted to ill, be restored to good againe; and therefore doth God, in more than this one place, expect our love in a kisse; for, if we be truly in love with Him, it will be a holy and an acceptable Metaphore unto us, els it will have a carnali and a fastidious taste, (in, 318) The unmistakable intent is to maximize the distance between a human and divine "kiss," compelling listeners first to imagine carnal lust and then to imagine that lust "restored to good againe." When the sign of fleshly adultery becomes the sign of heavenly fidelity, this pure embrace will deflect the terrible divine wrath (ra, 324). But the word "kiss," stretched with such tension between two diverse significations, almost snaps into incoherence. What might a kiss be without the desire to touch another's flesh intimately? Of what use is this accommodated metaphor? All the imaginative energy goes into evoking the carnal kiss of this world, while the sanctified kiss is defined solely by negation. The effect is bewilderment. Dividing the love we know from the love we should know, Donne has invested the imperative to kiss with a fear all its own - as if to think of kissing Christ with any carnal taint were to risk the consequences of "lest he be angry." In Holy Sonnet xix Donne compared his "prophane love" to his divine, judging his efforts to "court God" less healthy for his spirit than to "quake with true feare of his rod": "Those are my best day es, when I shake with feare." Yet in the sermon on "Kisse the Son," as in the poems I will consider next, love and fear are contraries that "meete in one."</page><page sequence="15">William Kerrigan 351 II. TWO HOLY SONNETS Joan Webber has shown that Donne, in common with other Renaissance theologians, understood the verses of the Bible as "enfolding" significance. In preaching manuals the word "opening" referred to the division and interpretation of the text; the preacher merely exposed or dilated meanings assumed to be already present, though compressed, in the Bible itself. A sacred metaphor, like a seed bearing a tree, contained the full extension of its vehicle and the consequences of that extension for its tenor.28 Perhaps this conception may help to describe that special way with conceits which we designate "metaphysical wit," indicating how Jack Donne became Dr. Donne without changing his habits of mind. For the way Donne presented the conventional metaphors of love poetry was exactly analo- gous to the way he "unraveled" or "opened" the sacred conceits of his sermons. In "The Broken Heart," for example, Donne constructed an elaborate metaphor to describe his failure with a certain cold lady. His scorned heart shivers like glass. But where is it now? She has refused the heart, so its pieces must still reside in his breast: as a broken mirror shows many little faces instead of one large face, so his heart cannot love any- more, but only reflect lesser images in liking, wishing, and adoring. The poem unravels, unfolds, discloses, and displays what already exists, com- pressed in the hoary cliche "You broke my heart." Donne reinvigorated this dead trope by assuming its literal truth and proceeding to complicate the tenor (his relationship with the lady) to fit the extended vehicle (the broken mirror). In a sense, the witty developments of the poem pre-exist in the initial cliche, folded up in the weave of convention and waiting there for a curious expositor. Donne did not open the vehicle to include, or the tenor to respond to, the sweeping of shards, seven years bad luck, or the purchase of a new glass - but there was nothing in his method, no re- straint in theory, to prevent him from doing so.29 Similarly, the disturbing rape in the last line of "Batter my heart" should be understood as implicit in the ancient theological conceit of the righteous soul's marriage to God.30 If the good man weds God, then the 28.

Given Donne's conception of sacred metaphor, the accommodated marriage would en- fold infidelity, divorce, and even imprisonment. It would compress all the things which attend earthly marriages, the only ones we know and the only ones our language can properly signify. More specifically, it may be appropriate to mention, but absurd to continue mentioning, that Donne was in fact imprisoned by the father of his bride and that this poem re- sembles, with interesting shifts of identity and reattributions of virtue, the drama of his own marriage: Batter my heart, three person'd God; for, you As yet but knocke, breathe, shine, and seeke to mend; That I may rise, and stand, o'erthrow mee, 'and bend Your force, to breake, bio we, burn and make me new. I, like an usurpt towne, ťanother due, Labour to'admit you, but Oh, to no end, Reason your viceroy in mee, mee should defend, But is capti v'd, and proves weake or untrue, Yet dearely'I love you, and would be lo v'd faine, But am bethroth'd unto your enemie, Divorce mee, 'untie, or breake that knot againe, Take mee to you, imprison mee, for I Except you'enthrall mee, never shall be free, Nor ever chast, except you ravish mee. To be sure, the poem is not so daring as it might have been. The phrase "three person'd God," for example, identifies the male lover addressed in Trinitarian terms, themselves derived by accommodation from the earthly family.31 I suppose that John Donne, in a certain mood, might have con- sidered naming the holy lover as the "father" of this hapless bride and played out the grotesque results in allusions to incest - but Donne, thank- fully, was not Crashaw. Nevertheless, "Batter my heart" does suggest by implication the details of its final phrase. 31. Indeed, the familial accommodation indicates one reason why theological arguments about the nature of the Trinity were so complex and often so tortuous: the abiding need was for a nonanthropomorphic formulation. I have a work in progress arguing that Milton arrived at his subordinationalist Christ by assuming the continuity of divine and human signification. The God of De Doctrina generated Christ because anterior fathers always generate posterior sons. Honoring the prior authority of God the Father, Milton imposed the sexual model of father creating son upon the deity, dismissing the orthodoxy of a co-essential and co-eternal Godhead - a rearrangement in keeping with his faith in the virtues of accommodated speech.</page><page sequence="17">William Kerrigan 353 Though often described as a poem with three conceits of equal im- portance developed in successive quatrains, really the poem evolves from and toward a single metaphor.32 For the bride addressing her lover, equated to the soul addressing God, is the implicit situation throughout - unless we are to believe that suddenly and ridiculously, with the phrase "Yet dearely'I love you," our speaker changes sex. Revealed with increas- ing clarity from 1. 9 to 1. 14, the figurative terms of this address are assumed in the "heart" of the opening line and continue to be assumed in the formal simile of the second quatrain. Thus the actual tenor of "Batter my heart" and "like an usurp t towne" is not, as in the usual reading, an experience of conversion. These subsidiary conceits have primary reference to the love relationship, itself an accommodated vehicle for the spiritual life of the soul, and during most of the poem the true sense of this crucial primary reference is left unsettled. So clear as vehicle and so loose as tenor, the language of the first two tropes is purposefully dislocated. This speaker would have her heart re- formed by the tinker's tools. But what exactly is she inviting from "three person'd God" when the terms of tinkering are translated to the terms of love? It will not suffice to recall the emblem tradition, where muscular arms wielding various tools reached from the clouds to batter or burn the miraculously suspended heart of the Christian Everyman, for the heart of this poem belongs to a misguided bride: the "emblem," if such it is, must be reshaped within the figures of another and controlling "emblem."33 The simile of the "usurpt towne" would appear to be clearer, at least in its reference to the interior betrayal of "weake or untrue" reason, since these words provide a semantic link between political intrigue and amorous infidelity. But "Labour to'admit you" implies that "three person'd God" is there at the gates, besieging the "usurpt towne" in the person of a monarch reclaiming his territory. We must contend once again with the activity desired of the lover who is, in this second subsidiary trope, a 32. For years this sonnet has been worried over in The Explicator , most of the debate centering upon the Trinitarian development of the three conceits, usually treated as discrete comparisons to be referred to the same tenor. See J. C. Levenson in 11 (1953), Item 31; George Herman in 12 (1953), Item 18, and the reply by Levenson in 12 (1954), Item 36; George Knox in 15 (1956), Item 2; David K.

What do the propositions of the second quatrain mean when transferred, as they must be transferred, to the love relationship? The language hovers, referentially uncertain, until fixed upon the desired event of the final line. There drama and definition coincide. "That I may rise, and stand, o'erthrow mee," "breake, blowe, burn and make me new," and "Labour to'admit you" - the drifting metaphors of the poem strike anchor in that ravishment which would make the speaker newly "chaste." The root problem in interpreting this sonnet is not whether its tripartite development conceals some allusion to the Trinity. Probably it does. What readers must confront, as fearlessly or fearfully as the poem itself, is the way Donne has unbalanced his central equation by choosing to detail the physical violation. Though metaphors be equations, we do not under- stand them as such: one term of this conceit must have linguistic, philo- sophical, and psychological priority and be, as we say, the theme, subject, or motive of the poem. Because of the personified "Reason," because "three person'd God" is named as the lover, we recognize that sexual rape is here a metaphor for the forcible entrance of the deity into an otherwise impenetrable soul. But the design of the poem grants extraordinary em- phasis to the penetration of a tight body. Insofar as the tropes reach out of local context to describe the climactic invitation, that sexual event acquires the force of a tenor. The intercourse of the speaker and God becomes virtually a "real" presence in the poem, a final repository of reference - the shore on which the gathering wave of implication finally breaks. Donne has turned his anthropomorphic conceit toward actual event, generating what might be termed a "cumulative metaphor." As the tinkering and the besieging express a desire for renewal and reclamation, looking forward to the ravishment, so do the very instruments and ob- jects of attack progress logically toward the sexual. A paradigm of this linguistic mobility, the opening phrase undergoes successive redefinitions. "Batter my heart" is addressed first to God the tinker, then becomes doubly applicable to the warrior God of 11. 5 and 6. She would "admit" the just ruler, but to "no end": by inference she wishes the monarch to reclaim his city with some "battering" engine of war, most likely a battering ram. Finally she "would be lov'd faine," though her heart is hard and her gates are closed, and the initial phrase becomes synonymous with the plea for ravishment, heart being not uncommon as a slang word for vagina during this period.34 The commands of the poem proceed through a 34. The sexual allusion is unmistakable in Fulke Greville's Caelica l, 11. 12-14: "At last he asks her, whose her backside is? / She vow'd that it was Scoggin's only part, / Who never</page><page sequence="19">William Kerrigan 355 series of transformations in assaulter and thing assaulted. The vehicles of her wishes flow together. The battered heart becomes the attacked city which becomes the ravished vagina. The tinker's tools become the mon- arch's engine which becomes, indeed, the penis of God. Donne's accumu- lation of assaults and batteries rests precisely there. We have the effect, in psychoanalytical terms, of moving from sublimation to cathexis or, in theological terms, of moving from relatively "safe" accommodations - God the tinker, God the king - to a "dangerous" accommodation made all the more evocative by the scheme of the movement itself. Donne has contrived a most "awful discrimination" of the human from the divine. Though all of sexuality, even prostatitis and moniliasis, may in theory lie folded within the ancient metaphor of spiritual marriage, Donne has opened a suggestiveness near to crude anthropomorphism. And crude anthropomorphism is another name for outright blasphemy. Recognizing how overtly this poem dares the forbidden, we can appre- ciate the uncommon power of its closing paradox. The equation of ravish- ment and chastity deflects the perilous situation reached through the un- raveling of accommodated love; having painted himself into a corner, Donne extricated himself by switching colors. We should eschew all interpretations that diminish the mystery of chaste ravishing. The word "chaste" here does not denote Spenserian chastity, the sanctification of sexuality in lawful marriage. More to the point, if we must have analogues, are the legends of the hagiographical tradition, which often represent the restoration of innocence to fallen female saints, or the discussion early in The City of God of the ravished martyrs who retained their physical purity.35 For as "make me new" would suggest, "nor ever chaste" con- cerns the recovery of virginity. Donne created this paradox by applying the traditional logic of accommodation. In Milton's formulation, we may participate without error in accommodated speech so long as "weakness when viewed in reference to ourselves" is understood as "most complete and excellent when imputed to God." What does it mean when, in the unfolding of anthropomorphic metaphors, the God we believe to be yet came nearer to her heart" (The Poems and Dramas ofFulke Greville , ed. Geoffrey Bullough [Oxford, 1945], I, 71). I suspect a similar pun in the third stanza of Donne's "The Legacy" and throughout "Loves Infiniteness." The heart, because of its central position in the upper body, its association with erotic passion, and the suggestive contours of its heraldic shape, would serve as a natural metaphor for the very central place of erotic activity. 35. The legend of Mary Margaret of Egypt, who forfeited her virginity to cross the Jordan and regained her virginity to enter the temple, is recounted in Aelfrics Lives of Saints , ed. Walter W. Skeat (2 vols.; Oxford, 1890-1900), n, 2-53. Augustine considers the prob- lem of ravished saints in The City of God i.xvi-xviii.</page><page sequence="20">356 English Literary Renaissance perfect would appear to be irregular? When God himself takes on those qualities he would suppress in us? With the conviction that God is the author of goodness alone, one can only say that human imperfection has obscured divine perfection. But how can we understand divine perfection? Since we know only human perfection, we can indicate our recognition of the failure of accommodation by conflating earthly weakness with earthly virtue: we can reaccommodate the failed accommodation. Therefore the rape of "Batter my heart" must preserve, rather than destroy, chastity. The God who violently ravishes must be the God who honorably abstains, the possessed soul a virgin soul. To escape from an irregular anthropomor- phism, Donne introduces a "complete and excellent" anthropomorphism, equating the imputed human vice to the appropriate and opposite human virtue. Anthropomorphism twice applied eludes anthropomorphism al- together. God, unlike any man, can be at once lustful and honorable. The soul, unlike any body, can be at once ravished and chaste. Beautifully cal- culated, the final line of "Batter my heart" presents the word "chaste" before "ravish me," relaxing anxieties an instant before the revelation that focuses them. As we read the last phrase, the human act we comprehend has already been diverted to a superhuman paradox. All at once we see the base and the miraculous. The strategy of "Batter my heart" - approaching the forbidden, reach- ing a moment of dangerous anthropomorphism, deflecting that danger, just before the moment appears, with an equation between carnality and virtue - also informs "Show me deare Christ." Here the passionate speaker desires to enjoy the true church promised in the Bible, ending the miser- able schisms of history.36 In the accommodated terms of the poem, this desire becomes the eager sexuality of the "amorous soule": Show me deare Christ, thy spouse, so bright and cleare. What, is it she, which on the other shore Goes richly painted? or which rob'd and tore Laments and mournes in Germany and here? Sleepes she a thousand, then peepes up one yeare? Is she selfe truth and errs? now new, now outwore? Doth she, 'and did she, and shall she evermore On one, on seaven, or on no hill appeare? 36. The Divine Poems , pp. 121-27. It is just conceivable that the various false brides of the poem allude indirectly to Augustine's notion in De bono conjugali xxi that Old Testament polygamy signified the future churches subject to one husband, Christ, while New Testa- ment monogamy foreshadowed the coming unity of all churches and all men under Christ, a unity to be perfected only in the city of God.</page><page sequence="21">William Kerrigan 357 Dwells she with us, or like adventuring knights First travaile we to seeke and then make love? Betray kind husband thy spouse to our sights, And let myne amorous soule court thy mild Dove, Who is most trew, and pleasing to thee, then When she'is embrac'd and open to most men. Until the final three lines the revelation sought is only distantly sexual. The speaker wishes to view the "bright and cleare" spouse in her radiant nakedness, not to possess her. Donne might have discontinued the un- folding of his conceit at the provocative but inexplicit "Betray ... to our sights," since the word "betray" carries a sexual implication neatly sub- ordinate to its primary meaning as a synonym for "Show" in 1. 1. More- over, the activity of seeing was itself invested with sexual significance in the classical optics Donne inherited. The word "propagation" referred to the multiplication of the visual image in the spatial continuum between the object and the eye - seeing was making love to the world. "Making babies" in Elizabethan slang denoted the mutual gaze of lovers.37 And certainly the Italianate love poetry of the sixteenth century had established gazing, glancing, glimpsing, peering, peeking, and peeping as a kind of sexual activity, a foreplaying near in effect to a consummation, electric as lightning and magnetic as the lodestone, sufficient to cause both orgasmic ecstasy and postvisual depression: Cupid's poets appreciated the many arrows in the quiver of an eye. However, as "make love" in 1. 10 fore- shadows, the poem shifts from subdued implication to overt proposition. Much resembling the sweep toward ravishment in "Batter my heart," there is a sense of inexorable progression in these lines, an unveiling of desire to match the unveiling desired. The conceit of "Show me deare Christ" extends beyond the tradition of its origin. In the common formulation the church is the bride of Christ, and by joining the church a man becomes metaphorically a woman; he becomes a "member" of the earthly body of the bride.38 Whereas Donne accepted a figurative womanhood in "Batter my heart," here he has made the marriage of the church a triangular affair by insisting on his actual, 37. Donne, of course, puns on the word "propagation" in "The Extasie," 1. 12. The similarity between the Latin pupula and pupulus resulted in the Elizabethan "making babies," a puppy love best represented by Astrophil and Stella , sonnet 11, 11. 9-10. 38. The traditional presentation of the metaphor may be exemplified by Augustine, De virginitate i. Cf. Greville's "Sion lies waste" (Caelica cix), 11. 15-16: "That sensual unsatiable vast womb / Of thy seen church, thy unseen church disgraceth."</page><page sequence="22">358 English Literary Renaissance rather than symbolic, sexuality. Given this fundamental revision, the argu- ment unfolds with pseudo-logical exactitude. Because the church trium- phant has yet to appear, Christ must be guarding his bride from other men; and because such jealousy is contrary to the true nature of Christ, he can be wooed into compliance with human wishes. So Christ is asked to become at last a "kind husband," generously betraying his wife to his friends. She will please him "most" when she is "embrac'd and open to most men." Reminiscent of many of the Songs and Sonnets , the wit of the concluding passage depends upon our ability to deduce the fallacious argument which must have preceded the statement before us. The doors of a church remain open; the more men who enter, the more pleased Christ is. Moving freely from object to concept and tenor to vehicle, the speaker offers a proposition admirable as religious desire but startling as sexual desire. The bride of "Batter my heart" wished to be penetrated by an eager male. The eager male of "Show me deare Christ" wishes to possess an "open" bride and he assumes the collective voice of "most men," con- vincing the husband to permit this betrayal in the interests of his own pleasure. With "a reverentiall feare" we again confront "an awful dis- crimination of Divine things from Civili." And again there is the balm of paradox. The bride is "most trew" when most unfaithful: she is at one time "selfe truth" and yet "errs." The husband finds her "most . . . pleasing" when human cuckolds find their wives most abhorrent: in her openness she will please him as a "most trew" spouse. Just at the moment of its definition, twisted adultery, in accord with the principles of accom- modated speech, becomes equated with exemplary fidelity. The reversal from vice to virtue differs ever so subtly from that of "Batter my heart," yet the difference is telling. For virginity and ravish- ment are forever incompatible on this earth. The conclusion of the earlier sonnet, anthropomorphically nonanthropomorphic, translates readers from the familiar life of the body to the inexpressible life of the soul. We approximate transcendence with the aid of a marvelous proportion: as ravishment is to the body, so chastity is to the soul. Similarly, no wife imaginable can be at once "most trew" and "open to most men." Yet this wife has been imagined, to our exquisite amazement, and she seems worthy to be the wife of Christ. However, the second reversal of "Show me deare Christ" does not escape from human categories. It is indeed possible for a human husband to consider his spouse "most . . . pleasing" when most untrue, and not only in the Darien, Connecticut, of modern</page><page sequence="23">William Kerrigan 359 America.39 Augustine put this case to his interlocutor in the dialogue On Free Choice of the Will: Evodias. I know that adultery is an evil because I myself would be unwilling to allow adultery in the case of my wife. And whoever does to another what he does not wish done to himself, does evil. Augustine. What if someone's lust is so great that he offers his own wife to another and willingly allows her to be seduced by the man with whose wife he in turn wants to have equal license? Don't you think that he does evil? Evodius. Yes, the worst evil! Augustine. By the rule you mentioned such a man does not sin, for he does nothing that he would not endure. You must find some other reason by which to prove that adultery is evil.40 Donne must find some other reason by which to prove that cuckoldry is miraculousš The Christ of the closing passage does not elude a recognizable and unhealthy human attitude. Donne has generated a paradox in the sense of "a proposition contrary to orthodoxy" - for husbands pleased by infidelity are rare - but not a paradox in the sense of "a proposition true but impossible." We are left with an awful similarity rather than an awe- some discrimination; the fine balance of danger and relief at the conclusion of "Batter my heart" does not recur. I feel that this difficulty accounts for the lingering dissatisfaction of Frank Kermode and accounts indirectly for the popularity of Helen Gardner's interpretation of the sonnet, which turns attention away from the problems of 11. 10-14 to concentrate instead upon the theological and topical significance of 11. 1-9.41 The last passage, beautiful as it is, nearly crumbles. Donne almost loses control of his reader's imagination and therefore of his intentional meaning. The lame paradox of "and pleasing to thee, then" threatens to undermine the trium- phant "most trew," for if we can imagine a human mari complaisant , we can also imagine his willing wife. This activity pushes "most trew" away from "most faithful" toward "most true to your desires." By now the poem is close, too close, to the tactless exercises in accommodated devo- tion we find in Crashaw, daring with no sense of danger, creating neither 39. The redoubtable Sir Kenelm Digby comes first to mind, and the homosexual Robert Carr, a principal figure in the Overbury case, may be another example. Certainly the willing cuckold is a familiar theme of romance, comedy, and tragedy. The sporting host of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight appears to be offering everything; Messer Nicia in Machiavelli^ Mandragola becomes so convinced that cuckoldry is in his best interest that he reaches under the sheets to confirm with his own hand the success of the desired betrayal (v.ii); the husband of Arden of Faversham accommodates the passions of Mosbie. 40.

Donne could not conceive of God without discovering, somewhere in the folds of his conception, human vice. It may be objected that the two poems I have discussed do not un- ravel metaphors inherent in Christian theology; one may dismiss the religious implications of these fearful accommodations by supposing that Donne, acting out some private compulsion, deliberately generated the inessential images of God the rapist and Christ the willing cuckold. But consequences of anthropomorphism as grotesque as these lie coiled in the most central Christian doctrines. The De ecclesiastica rhetorica of Valerio, a popular manual for preachers, alerted its readers to this contingency by forbidding the wanton, though logical, "opening" of doctrines such as the redemption: There are, however, many warnings which the orator must heed in the use of metaphors. First that they be not taken from remote things. . . . Finally that they do not originate from anything unseemly, as when someone would call God the killer of Christ; for he commanded that he should die for the sins of men so that he satisfy by that death divine justice and open the gates of Heaven to believing men. He ought not for that reason to be called killer; and, in short, easy metaphors, taken from beautiful things and applied with judgment, which wise men have called the essence of prudence, illuminate the sermon.42 As a "father" God raises his "son" to a position of full equality. But as a "father" God also requires the sacrificial murder of his "son" to atone for our disobedience. Of course, to the extent that God the Father appears sadistic, to that extent he is not to be apprehended as a human being. When the metaphor turns perverse, God vacates the metaphor. Yet again, without the metaphor - and it is one sanctioned by the Bible, the exeget- ical tradition, the liturgy, and the prayers of many generations - we can- not think of God at all. It may be "the essence of prudence" to confine oneself to "easy metaphors." But there is, as Valerio realized, a dreadful logic to be avoided as we expound the most comforting doctrine of the Christian faith. Donne was the one great poet of the English Renaissance to exploit the fearful consequences of accommodation in his devotional verse. Spenser, 42. Quoted in Schleiner, The Imagery of John Donne's Sermons , pp. 45-46.</page><page sequence="25">William Kerrigan 361 Herbert, Milton, and Marvell were careful to avoid imputing vice to God. When they unfolded anthropomorphic metaphors, they did so with evi- dent caution. The Christ of Herbert's "The Sacriflce,, exhibits an inhuman sense of humor, but in comprehending his ironies we admire without qualification the intelligence and self-possession they imply. In the devo- tional lyrics of Herbert accommodated vice never remains, at the end of the poem, to trouble our conception of the God addressed, since by then all blasphemies have redounded upon the speaker. More comparable to Donne in this regard was Ben Jonson, whose lyric "To Heaven" addresses God as an accommodated "judge" dispensing something less than justice.43 But Jonson did not, in the manner of his contemporary, emphasize the distance between true and false human judgment. Donne alone explored the difference between God as we know him and God as we must believe him to be, compelling us to recognize the conjunction of vice and virtue as the necessary condition of our knowledge of the deity. Accommodation for Donne was both our gift and our curse. He wrote of the two faces of God in his brilliant Holy Sonnet xiii, superimposing the compassionate Son upon the vengeful Father: Marke in my heart, O Soule, where thou dost dwell, The picture of Christ crucified, and tell Whether that countenance can thee affright, Teares in his eye quench the amasing light, Blood fills his frownes, which from his pierc'd head fell, And can that tongue adjudge thee unto hell, Which pray'd forgivenesse for his foes fierce spight? Tears extinguish the fearful light, blood hides the frowns, the tongue of judgment prays for mercy - it is a lovely definition of the Atonement, the cancellation of Old Testament wrath by New Testament love. Christ incarnate perfected the accommodated speech of the Bible, embodying God in human form and leaving an example of unambiguous virtue in this life. Yet for Donne that other face remained, hidden rather than vanquished, and while a "beauteous forme" could not "affright," the contorted visage of a wrathful God was there to be imagined behind the face of compassion. The paradoxes of "Batter my heart" and "Show me deare Christ" reenact, within the particular terms of their anthropomorphism, this concealment: behind chastity is violation, behind fidelity is adultery. Mysteriously, our 43.

Within the context of Christian time the fearful accommodation of God to man presupposes a mythic history. The primal likeness between God and man was genuinely harmonious. There was no grotesquerie to complicate our prelapsarian knowledge of the deity, because there was no human evil - no rape, adultery, or murder. Adam in his garden, the Un- fällen image of God, could understand his divine "father" or "friend" without fear of unraveling an "awful discrimination" from these meta- phors.44 That first disobedience, defacing man, inevitably defaced his image of God: No more of talk where God or angel Guest With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us'd To sit indulgent, and with him partake Rural repast, permitting him the while Venial discourse unblam'd: I now must change These Notes to Tragic. . . ,45 So Milton began Book ix of his epic, announcing both the historical loss of "Venial discourse unblam'd" and the loss within his own poem of un- ambivalent celebration. When the Fall turned all notes to tragic, har- monious likeness became fearful likeness. Because we know God in our own image and because that image, being corrupt, will at some time turn perverse when fitted to God, God must remain an object of dread for those unwilling to abjure the ancient privileges of analogy. It is true that God is fearful because he is incomprehensible. It is equally true that God is fearful because we can and do understand him. The creator, in this impor- tant sense, fell with the creature. John Donne dramatized with special clarity the problems of all Christian devotion. Surely Aquinas was correct in his belief that a man with religious 44. Augustine states that our first parents lived with "their love to God . . . unclouded," entirely "free from all perturbation" (City of God xrv.x). Being "exempt from the vicissi- tudes of fear and desire," Adam and Eve found that "true gladness ceaselessly flowed from the presence of God" (xiv.xxvi). Augustine is echoed by Luther in Lectures on Genesis , pp. 61ÍF., 114, 165. 45. Paradise Lost ix.1-6, from The Complete Poems and Major Prose , ed. Merritt Y. Hughes (New York, 1959), p. 378. "May I express thee unblam'd?" the narrator asked at in.3, the word "unblam'd" connecting his attempt to name God with the loss of "Venial discourse unblam'd" after the Fall. Milton's Adam recovers his love for God. But in a fallen world, where good prayers are not spontaneous and language addressed to God may be blameworthy, love is hand in hand with fear: "Henceforth I learn, that to obey is best, / And love with fear the only God . . ."

Sober men such as Calvin endeavored to avoid the embarrassments of anthropomorphism by sealing up the Scriptures against unrestrained imaginations. Theologically this was doubtless the genteel position. But with insistent wit Donne, like other believers before and after him, made the old metaphors reveal their hidden grotesquerie. Such effects should be considered as neither the pathological impositions of a terror-struck convert nor the doctrinal expositions of a stolid conformist. Rather, the temperament and the religion unveiled each other. Donne arrived at these moments by per- mitting the traditional language of devotion to mean what it does mean and opening that language until, having proposed a fallen God, he raised his healing paradox. Behind the merciful face of God lay another face twisted in wrath and capable of the most fearsome acts. Finally, both faces belonged to man. For whenever his accommodated metaphors spoiled, his humanity had failed, not his God: in deference to this failure he con- jured the image of man rectified. At such moments Donne worshipped human evil with the difficult faith that evil was, when predicated of God, perfection. "The love of God begins in fear, and the fear of God ends in love; and that love can never end, for God is love" (vi, 113). UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA</page></plain_text>
