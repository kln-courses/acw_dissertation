<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOURNAL of ADVERTISING EDITORIAL Truth in Advertising Any question regarding truth in advertising de- pends immediately upon the intended meanings of specific ads or commercials. Are these meanings true, misleading, deceptive, or false? Any such question, therefore, immediately entails a search for, and an identification of, these intended meanings. And, once identified, are they true of the product being advertised? Thus, truth in advertising is the problem of advertising evaluation, and automatically assumes its search for obtaining valid techniques that will yield true measurements of intended mean- ing, and subsequently, other psychographic properties. So, how's the search going for achieving truth in advertising?, that is to say, how's the search going for achieving coherent research techniques? Unfor- tunately, not too well. There is, in fact, a coherency crisis in advertising and consumer behavior research. Our best research efforts seem to be singularly re- stricted to some variant of anthropomorphic em- piricism. There is even an effort to re-define the con- sumer's mind (hence, all psychographics) in terms of neurophysiological phenomena-just as if 2500 years of Western Civilization have never existed. In the universities, except for isolated cases, we seem to have great difficulty in moving beyond train- ing programs in vocational education. While the basic trade skills are absolutely necessary in adver- tising education, these simply are not the criteria by means of which a profession is measured - as the current state of advertising and consumer be- havior research would seem to show. Joseph W. McGuire, V.P. of Planning at UC-Berkeley, recently remarked: "Currently the behavioral areas consist of a morass of conflicting theories and schools, with very little that is useful to the practicing manager." In agencies, the status of the search for truth is indicated by the highly virulent skepticism toward advertising research. While many top research people in the industry have repeatedly defined the problem to be at the theoretical level, coherent analyses of currently employed theoretical presuppositions simply do not exist. Understanding that a coherent theory is a necessary prerequisite for explaining advertising on a scientific basis, some positive effort in this direction-beyond anthropomorph ism-woul d seem to be urgently needed. In the meantime, clients are reaching out for something better. With increasing frequency they change agencies, purchase a la carte advertising services, and ponder the feasibility of "house" agen- cies. In fact, some are even beginning to pursue basic research in the social and behavioral sciences. As a matter of economic survival, clients are rapidly learn- ing that "share of market" means, in effect, "share of mind." But, to work for "share of mind" will re- quire knowledge about the mind. This means that the type of psychological theories that direct their research must necessarily be valid for human beings. Coherent consumer research will depend on how psy- chographic phenomena are defined generically. So, the search for achieving truth in advertising suffers the problems normally associated with any embryonic discipline, namely, a lack of solid founda- tions in coherent theory, verifiable laws, and valid scientific methodology. Any test instrument truly valid for measuring consumer behavior will simul- taneously provide a true measurement of the com- municative effectiveness of specific advertisements. The struggle to advance new hypotheses will not be easy, it never has been, and we are very likely to suffer some growing pains in the process. But the nurturing effort should be made by those of us most intimately involved with advertising, and not left by default to the destructive forces of our critics. And this effort will mean, in effect, the encouragement of points of view that differ radically from our own. In universities, the search for truth in advertising means that administrators and faculty might actually encourage that graduate student who sees in adver- tising an intellectual challenge and excitement far beyond that afforded by its vocational aspects. In agencies, it means that top management might actually encourage those research personnel who know the difference between scientific explanation and statistical technology. We aim toward a level of professionalism such that our client can confidently base his advertising budget for next year on our ad- vertising evaluation research. In addition, with the free market system at stake, we should aim to an- swer our critics with explanations based on better theoretical foundations than anthropomorphism. Vo- cational expertise has not provided industry leader- ship in reaching these goals. In client organizations, the main problem now seems to be one of communication between top man- agement, who makes policy, and the research per- sonnel who implement that policy. All evidence within the last ten years indicates that top manage- ment has learned some hard lessons about the validity of current research in the behavioral sciences. In genuine science, coherent explanations are based in some kind of theory-however loosely constructed it may be. And whereas just ten short years ago "theory" was not a word to be safely employed in the "real world", the evidence now is that clients are actually leading the way in the re-examination of those theories that direct current advertising and consumer behavior research. 48</page><page sequence="2">Ultimately, the search for truth in advertising is an issue that can only be decided by the coherency of our psychological theories and verifiable laws es- tablished on their assumptions. However, it is a search that should be shared by everyone connected with advertising in any way. This means that there will naturally arise many conflicting points of view of what constitutes truthful advertising and truthful research. A primary purpose of this journal is to pro- vide a public forum wherein these conflicting points of view can be fairly contested in the market place of ideas. Dan Stewart 49</page></plain_text>
