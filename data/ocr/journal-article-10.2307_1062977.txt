<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lawrence A. Babb THE GREAT CHOICE: WORLDLY VALUES IN A JAIN RITUAL CULTURE Jainism is renowned for its emphasis on extremes. As is well known, the Jains have followed the moral logic of nonharm (ahimsa) to lengths undreamed of by Western advocates of animal rights. Some Jain men- dicants, for example, don masks designed to prevent the wearer's breath from harming microscopic forms of life in the atmosphere. Also, and most significantly for this paper, Jainism is renowned for the rigor of the asceticism it promotes. Jain asceticism is manifested in many ways, but emblematic of its uncompromising severity is the fact that death by self-starvation (sallekhana) is enshrined as one of the tra- dition's highest ideals. For a radically world-rejecting religious tradition to flourish in the midst of the world's endeavors-that is, for it to exist as a reproducible social institution-there must be points of connection between the cen- tral values it affirms and the ends pursued by adherents who make their way in the world. In the case of Jainism, the tradition's highest values define a lifeway suitable only for a monastic elite, but at the same time this elite cannot exist without the support of lay communities. A Jain tradition in the fullest sense, as opposed to a mere soteriology, therefore The research on which this paper is based took place in Jaipur between August 1990 and May 1991 and was supported by a Fulbright senior research fellowship. I thank col- leagues at the Department of History and Indian Culture, University of Rajasthan, for their hospitality and assistance, especially Dr. Mukund Lath. I am indebted to too many members of the Jain community to be mentioned here, but I would like to express special gratitude to Mr. Surendra Bothara. I also thank John Cort and James Laidlaw for ex- tremely helpful readings of earlier drafts. ? 1994 by The University of Chicago.

How can such a religious system "work," especially when, as in Jainism, world renunciation is so central a value? This article deals with this issue by examining the ritual culture of a contem- porary Jain community. The community in question is that of the image-worshiping (miirtipu- jak)1 SvetSmbar Jains of the Rajasthani city of Jaipur, most of whom are linked with a mendicant lineage called the Khartar Gacch.2 In what fol- lows I describe and analyze traditions of worship among these Jains, fo- cusing in particular on the way the identity and religious interests of Jain laity are expressed in ritual symbols. I begin with analysis of the worship of beings known as Tirthankars or Jinas. Here we find an idealized con- cept of what it is to be a lay Jain. This concept, as we shall see, contains an inherent instability. I then turn to the worship of four deceased men- dicants known as Dadagurus or Dadagurudevs. Here the ritual identity of the worshiper is linked with the worldly aspirations and the social iden- tity of lay Jains. At this level the instability is resolved. APOTHEOSIZED ASCETICS Jainism is many things: a soteriology, a theology, a body of myth, and more. But for the present I want to concentrate on one basic fact. Jains worship ascetics. This interaction is the foundation of Jain ritual culture. The charter of Jainism's ritual culture is a particular utterance, the mahamantra (also called the namaskar mantra or the navkir mantra), which is the tradition's universal prayer and all-purpose ritual formula. It is repeated on most ritual occasions, and many Jains consider it to contain an inherent power that, among other things, can protect the ut- terer. It expresses homage to the five paramesthins, the five supreme deities, and it is crucial to note that these are the only entities the tra- dition deems truly worthy of worship. They are, in order, the arhats ("worthy ones" who have attained omniscience), the siddhas (the liber- ated), the acaryas (ascetic leaders), the upddhyiyas (ascetic precep- tors), and the sadhus (ascetics).3 All are ascetics, some living and some not. In the Jain tradition, to be worthy of worship is to be an ascetic. 1 Distinguished from the image worshipers are the Sthanakvasi and Terapanthi sects that are opposed to the worship of images in temples. 2 On the nature of such mendicant lineages and their organization, see John E. Cort, "The Svetambar Murtipiijak Jain Mendicant," Man, n.s., 26 (1991): 549-69. 3 The full mahamantra is as follows: I bow before the worthy ones [arhats]-the Jinas; I bow before the perfected beings [siddhas]-those who have attained moksa; I bow before the [mendicant] leaders [acaryas] of the Jaina order; I bow before the [mendicant] preceptors [upddhyayas]; I bow before all the [Jaina] mendicants [sddhus] in the world. 16</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions The arhats are the principal beings represented by images and wor- shiped in Jain temples. Also known as tirthankars (tirthankaras) or ji- nas, they are human beings who found the path to liberation from the world's bondage and taught that path to others. The term Tirthankar means "one who establishes a ford (across the ocean of existence)." Such beings establish the teachings of Jainism and also leave behind them a social order (the caturvidh sangh) consisting of four groups: male ascetics (sddhus), female ascetics (sadhvis), laymen (sravaks), and laywomen (sravikds). The term "Jina" means "victor," by which is meant one who has achieved complete victory over attachments and aversions. An infinity of Tirthankars have already come and gone in the cosmos; the Tirthankars of the future are likewise infinite in number. The last in our era and sector of the world was Lord Mahavir (Mahavira) who lived, taught, and achieved liberation some 2,500 years ago. All Tirthankars lead the ideal life as Jainism defines it. Although their biographies differ greatly in specific details, the life of each and every Tirthankar is defined by precisely five events, and these events are always exactly the same. They are known as the five kalyanaks (the five welfare-producing events): (1) the descent of the Tirthankar-to-be into a human womb (cyavan),4 (2) his5 birth (janam), (3) his initiation as an ascetic (diksd), (4) his attainment of omniscience (kevaljidn), and (5) his final liberation (nirvdn). The five kalyinaks are paradigmatic for acts of worship in Jainism. Whenever a kalydnak takes place in the life of any Tirthankar, the gods and goddesses who reside in the various Jain heavens come to the scene to admire and support him. In rites of worship, human beings take on the personae of these deities: they admire and support the Tirthankar just as the deities do. All five of the kalyanaks are cele- brated in ritual, but the most important is the first, the birth kalydnak. Whenever a Tirthankar is born, the Indra (ruling deity) of the first heaven conveys the infant to Mt. Meru, where he and other gods and goddesses assemble to give him his postpartum bath (abhisek). Emula- tion of this act by human worshipers is central to daily temple worship and to many other rites as well. The normal daily rite of temple worship is known as the astprakdri pijd, the "eightfold worship," and is so named because it consists of eight separate ritual acts, each centering on the use or offering of one of eight different substances or items. Individuals often perform this This fivefold salutation, which destroys all sin, is preeminent as the most auspicious of auspicious things. [Translation from Padmanabh S. Jaini, The Jaina Path of Purification (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979), pp. 162-63] 4 Before his final lifetime on earth, a Tirthankar-to-be exists as a heavenly deity. 5 Of the twenty-four Tirthankars of our cosmic era, only one (Malli, number 19) was female. 17</page><page sequence="4">The Great Choice rite (or some variation of it) as part of a routine morning temple visit, and its underlying structure is the basis of virtually all SvetSmbar rites of worship. The worshiper first bathes the image with milk and water.6 In doing so, he or she is assuming the role of the Indras or Indranis, the kings and queens of the gods, who take the leading parts in bathing the infant Tirthankar on Mt. Meru.7 The worshiper next anoints the image with sandalwood paste (or a mixture of sandalwood paste and saffron) on nine (or sometimes more) points of its body. He or she then offers flowers, incense, and a lamp. In the rite's final phase, the worshiper offers unbroken grains of rice by forming them into a diagram. The worshiper first creates a svastik, the four arms of which represent the four categories of unliberated beings (deities, humans, dwellers in hell, animals and plants), and above this three dots representing the "three jewels" of Jainism (knowledge, insight, right conduct). At the dia- gram's apex the worshiper forms a crescent enclosing a dot; this repre- sents the abode of liberated souls (siddhsila) at the top of the cosmos. Having formed this figure, the worshiper offers food (usually sweets) by placing it at the svastik's vertex; he or she then offers fruit by plac- ing it on the crescent at the top of the diagram. This rite is considered a form of what is called dravya pijd, meaning worship with "material things." The reference is to the substances and items utilized in the rite: the water, sandalwood paste, flowers, and so on. Having completed dravya piiuj, the worshiper should engage in what is called bhav piij. This is internal, nonphysical worship and consists of meditation on the Tirthankar and the qualities he represents while reciting or singing certain texts. Interpretations of the dstprakdri pijd provided in various laymen's manuals stress soteriological themes, and this is reinforced by the stan- zas such manuals provide to be recited or meditated upon while per- forming the rite.8 For example, the act of bathing the image is said to express the worshiper's hope of washing away the impurities that have accumulated on his or her soul from beginningless time, and the appli- cation of sandalwood paste (a cooling substance) is held to express the 6 For more complete descriptions of this rite, see Lawrence A.

The remaining acts are interpreted in similar ways. The last offering, the fruit, stands for the "fruit" of the rite, liberation, which is why it is placed on the part of the diagram that represents the liberated state. A fact of very great importance is that, according to orthodox ide- ology (as encountered both in written sources and conversation), worshipers do not engage in any kind of transaction with the Tirthan- kar when they worship him. The reason is the fifth kalydnak, the Tirthankar's liberation. This kalyanak is not the focus of very much Jain ritual, but it has a great deal to do with the definition of the ritual situ- ation because it establishes the Tirthankar as a liberated being.9 For the Jains, liberation is a complete withdrawal into a nontransactional state, a total realization of the ascetic ideal. Ascetics who are on the road to liberation attenuate their transactions with the rest of the world; libera- tion is the complete cessation of such transactions. In his liberated state the Tirthankar is entirely devoid of rag and dves (attachment and aver- sion), and is therefore completely disengaged from the world of giving and taking. He responds to no prayers or petitions, and dispenses no saving grace; he exists, but transactionally he is nonexistent.10 The efficacy of worship, therefore, is reflexive; that is, whatever rit- ual does is done by the human ritual actor to himself. This is among the most important themes in Jain ritual culture, and a good illustration of it is provided by the following passages taken from a layman's manual authored by a Svetambar (Khartar Gacch) nun named Hemprabhasri. Worship (pujd), she says, results in "purity of soul" (dtmavisuddhi).1l Elsewhere she elaborates this basic idea by saying, "Just as the darsan of the supreme soul [paramatmd, meaning the Tirthankar] makes the mind pure and becomes the means of the removal of karma [karm nir- jard], so the pujd of the Lord encourages positive feelings [bhdvollds], and the spark of positive feelings burns karma and reduces it to ashes. Worship [dradhnd] is done in order to destroy sensual vices and eradi- cate karma. Just as austerity and self-denial eradicate karma, in the same way the Lord's puja, done with devotion, also destroys karma and provides many worldly benefits [ldbh] besides. Auspicious feelings 9 For Svetambar Jains, divdli commemorates Mahavir's liberation, but this is a rather unobtrusive part of the overall divali celebrations. 10 Although doctrine insists that the Tirthankar cannot be present to the worshiper, it is clear from the emotions that many Jains feel during worship that to many he is indeed present in some sense. Gombrich's well-known distinction between "cognitive absence" and "affective presence" probably applies here. See Richard Gombrich, Precept and Practice: Traditional Buddhism in the Rural Highlands of Ceylon (London: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1971), p. 142. 1l Hemprabhasriji, p. 27. 19</page><page sequence="6">The Great Choice [?ubh bhdv] result in the binding of merit [punya bandh], and from merit, material [paudgalik] happiness is automatically acquired."12 As we see, from her standpoint worship is really a kind of substitute form of world renunciation, which in Jainism is the principal means of shedding the karma that impedes the soul's liberation. In this sense the act of worshiping an ascetic becomes-itself-an ascetic act. She also adds that these ritual acts result in worldly benefits by means of that (relatively) positive form of karma called "merit" (punya). It is impor- tant to note, however, that she nowhere says that any benefit of the rite-material or spiritual-will actually come from the object of wor- ship, the Tirthankar. This is not an arcane or obscure point among Jaipur Jains; it is widely understood.13 Given this context, the aim of the ritual act cannot be connection with the object of worship. In some Hindu ritual cultures (which pre- vail in the wider society beyond the Jain world) the theme of union with divine beings is very strong and is frequently expressed in the way food offerings are treated. Offerings are first given to the object of worship and then consumed by the offerers; the deity's blessing and powers are thereby internalized by devotees. Because the Tirthankar is nontransactive, however, such exchanges are impossible. Nonetheless, if one cannot become him, one can become like him. Thus, in a verse often accompanying food offerings in Svetambar worship,l4 the Tirthankar is characterized as andhiri, noneating, whereas the offerer is a being who eats; just as the Lord has renounced food, the offerer likewise symbolically renounces it, with the goal of attaining the same consumptionless state.15 The offering of food is seen through the lens of ascetic values. The food, having been renounced, cannot be returned to the offerers. Indeed, the consumption of returned offerings is ex- pressly forbidden, a point to which we shall return. And, instead of connection with the Tirthankar, emulation of him emerges as the prin- cipal goal of worship. To the degree that the ritual act is seen as an ascetic act, the relation- ship between worship and worldly values is necessarily tense. Jains be- 12 Ibid., p. 25. 13 The question of how Tirthankar worship can produce material results is a vexed one, even within the tradition. The punya explanation is not the only one. Some say that particular images have special power, and this is sometimes associated with the mantra (sacred utterance) transferred to the image at the time of its consecration. It is also widely believed that the Tirthankar's attendant deities are the actual agency of the rite's material effectiveness. These are partial violations of the principle of reflexivity. For fur- ther discussion of this issue, see Cort, Liberation and Wellbeing, pp. 405-25. 14 HemprabhaSriji, p. 37; Muktiprabhvijay, p. 60. 15 I have discussed Jain ritual food offerings in greater detail in an earlier article ("Giving and Giving Up"). 20</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions lieve that worshiping the Tirthankars can generate worldly prosperity and happiness (in this life or another, on earth or in heaven), and many Jains engage in ritual activities precisely for this reason. Indeed, Hemprabhasri-the nun cited above-explains how worldly benefits result from the merit generated by the act. The desire for worldly benefits, however, is inconsistent with the ascetic values that norma- tive interpretations of the rite express. There is not the slightest doubt that this is felt as a real tension by many lay Jains; certainly such ten- sion was manifested in the hedgings and evasions that were character- istic of the various discussions I had with Jains about the fruits of worship. I was told repeatedly that, although many Jains (some said most Jains) seek good worldly results from their temple going and other religious activities, they should not be seeking such things. Such persons, I was told, are "ignorant" about what Jainism really is; Jain- ism is basically about tyag, giving things up. The entire matter is awk- ward, even embarrassing, precisely because many Jains do indeed seek worldly benefits from worship, all the while knowing that there is something deeply questionable about doing so. The tradition allows worldly values a sphere of legitimacy, but this is a subordinate sphere; the legitimacy of worldly values is, at least at this highest level of the tradition, defensive.16 What, then, is the role of worldly well-being in the Jain cosmos? To explore this issue further we must take a brief look at Jain gods and goddesses, the tradition's paradigmatic worshipers. DEITIES The Tirthankers are not to be confused with "deities" (devs). Although the deities exist on a higher plane than humans, they are nonetheless unliberated beings. Moreover, the deities are not, in the strict sense, ob- jects of worship. They cannot be. Jains worship ascetics, but the gods and goddesses of Jainism are the opposite of ascetics. Because of merit accumulated in previous lives, they reap the rewards of a heavenly ex- istence.17 They are perpetually young and their spans of life are im- mensely long. Their bodies are luminous and impervious to illness, and they are vastly wealthy and possess special powers that humans do not have. They exist for the sole purpose of enjoyment, the very enjoyment 16 Another way to put this is to say that, in this context, what Laidlaw calls "moksa [liberation] discourse" tends to overpower what he calls "punya [merit] discourse." See James A. Laidlaw, "Profit, Salvation and Profitable Saints," Cambridge Anthropology 9 (1985): 50-70. 17 I have drawn these details from Hiralal Jain's commentary on Santisuri's Jivvicdr Prakaran (Santisuri, Jivvicdr Prakaran [sarth-savivecan], ed. Hiralal [Dugar] Jain [Ma- dras: Sri Jain Marg Prabhfivak Sabha, 1949]). Most Jains have a good general idea of what the gods are like. 21</page><page sequence="8">The Great Choice the ascetic rejects. Their lives may be said to represent every kind of worldly happiness in a perfected state, and if the Tirthankars are apo- theosized ascetics, the gods and goddesses represent the apotheoses of worldly felicity. This contrast may be said to represent a Jain version of what T. N. Madan characterizes as a general opposition between the good life and its renunciation in the Hindu tradition, between yogi (as- cetic) and bhogi (enjoyer).18 But there is a flaw in the picture. Despite their special powers, the gods cannot attain liberation, for this is possible only in a human body. Asceticism is the key to liberation, but the gods are "enjoyers" by defi- nition, and thus cannot be ascetics; they cannot even fast, for they do not eat. Jainism does not condemn the felicity of the gods; rather, it affirms it as the natural reward of virtuous action, including acts of worship. Indeed, one of the highest worldly rewards of virtue (or ascet- icism) is rebirth as a deity. But the gods also illustrate the ultimate futility of such a path. Even for the gods, worldly delights are imper- manent, for, although their lives are eons long, they must perish and fall from heaven in the end. And, so long as they are gods, they cannot obtain liberation. In the redemptive economy of the Jain cosmos the deities' role is not to serve as objects of worship, but to be the tradition's archetypal wor- shipers. They are not ascetics; they are lay Jains who project an ideal image of what lay Jains must do as ones who worship ascetics. This role is reiterated whenever the five kalyanaks occur. On infinite occa- sions throughout infinite time the gods and goddesses have come for- ward to be the prime admirers and supporters of those who are truly worthy of worship, the Tirthankars. They thereby provide the pattern for human acts of worship. As we have seen, when human beings wor- ship the Tirthankars, they identify with gods and goddesses, and espe- cially with Indra and Indrani. It is true that certain Jain deities are offered a type of worship, but this illustrates the more general principle that only ascetics are truly worthy of worship. Jains believe that some gods and goddesses will respond to prayers, as Tirthankars do not and cannot, with worldly boons. The ancillary deities (adhis.tayak devs) of the Tirthankars serve this function, and some (such as Padmavati and Cakresvari) have cults of their own. The guardian deities of temples (called ksetrapals) are also believed to come to the aid of worshipers, and some of these have likewise become important deities in their own right. But they are never truly independent objects of worship, and their worship is seen 18 T. N. Madan, Non-renunciation: Themes and Interpretations of Hindu Culture (Delhi: Oxford University Press, 1987), pp. 10, 98. 22</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions as a kind of postscript to the worship of the Tirthankars. Jains say that these deities come to the aid of human beings because of their approval of piety directed not toward them, but toward the Tirthankars. A good example of such a deity is Nakora Bhairav, who is the guard- ian deity of Lord Parsvanath's19 image at a famous temple complex at Nakora (near Balotra in western Rajasthan).20 This god is reputed to be extremely powerful, and has a very large following in Jaipur where his image is a common feature of temples and household shrines. Most pil- grims who go to Nakora do so to worship Bhairav in order to seek his aid in worldly matters. When I was present the sums paid for the priv- ilege of performing rites for Bhairav were considerably higher than for Parsvanath.21 Nonetheless, it is Parsvanath, not Bhairav, who is-in theory-the principal object of worship at this temple, and Bhairav is seen as his worshiper and protector. It is significant that the promo- tional brochures distributed by the temple's trust give only passing mention to Nakora's main claim to fame, which is Nakora Bhairav, stressing instead the images of the Tirthankars, the quality of the art- work, and so on.22 This illustrates the more general principle that from the standpoint of the tradition's dominant values-values that the au- thors of the brochure are willing to articulate publically-the seeking of worldly boons is an awkward feature of the situation that needs to be minimized and that, in any case, it is the Tirthankars, not deities like Bhairav, who are the real objects of worship. For the Jains the most important fact about the cosmos is the advent of beings who establish the path of liberation. The great problematic is the question of what will be the relationship between such a being and other beings. The paradigm of worship, focused on the gods, expresses a relationship that must exist if a Jain tradition is to exist, that between ascetics (epitomized by the Tirthankars) and those who are not ascetics but worship ascetics (epitomized by the gods). This relationship is en- acted whenever lay Jains admire and support living ascetics, and it is at the heart of the act of worshiping the Tirthankars' images. The dei- ties thus illustrate a way-one of two possible ways-of being a Jain. Theirs is the path of the worshiper, not of the ascetic. Moreover, in 19 The twenty-third Tirthankar of our era and sector of the world. 20 See also Caroline Humphrey, "Fairs and Miracles: At the Boundaries of the Jain Community in Rajasthan," in The Assembly of Listeners: Jains in Society, ed. Michael Carrithers and Caroline Humphrey (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1991), pp. 220-21. 21 Prices for the right to perform such ceremonies are determined by means of an auc- tion called boli. 22 The Hindi version includes a small picture of Bhairav with brief identifying captions; the English version includes the same picture and notes (as the Hindi version does not) that many pilgrims come to Nakora who yearn for "wealth, position and worldly desires." 23</page><page sequence="10">The Great Choice their felicity the heavenly deities embody what John Cort has shown to be an entire "realm of value" in the Jain world, that of auspiciousness and worldly well-being.23 But the message the gods send is mixed, for their well-being must always end. Worldly benefits are there to be had, but this is spiritual fool's gold. The alternative is the ascetic's path, which is directly linked with lib- eration. Asceticism can certainly lead to worldly rewards, including di- vine rebirth. Many lay Jains engage in temporary ascetic acts (such as fasting) for the precise purpose of attaining such results, and-as we shall see-some of the ascetics of the past most revered by Jaipur Jains are believed to be deities in heaven at present. Acts of worship, more- over, can be seen as steps along the way to liberation. Nonetheless, as- ceticism is the sine qua non of liberation, which is the tradition's highest aspiration. This, indeed, is the source of the normative ten- dency to interpret ritual acts as ascetic acts. The true goal of asceticism is not the world's delights, but a state of being beyond all delights and sorrows. Deities and ascetics are therefore opposed, and their opposition rep- resents a basic choice between two unequally valued modes of religious practice. This choice, in turn, is embedded in Jainism's conception of how Jain teachings enter history. This brings us to the crucial matter of kingship. KINGSHIP AND THE GREAT CHOICE When a Tirthankar-to-be enters a womb, his mother is visited by four- teen auspicious dreams. It is difficult to exaggerate the importance of these dreams. In accounts of the Tirthankar's birth they are almost al- ways enumerated, and they are also ritually enacted during paryusan, the year's most sacred occasion. They have a double meaning. These are the dreams that precede the birth of a universal emperor (cakravar- tin), but they also announce the birth of a Tirthankar.24 In other words, a Tirthankar is one who might have been an earthly king but became an ascetic instead.25 In this connection it is important to note that a Tirthankar-to-be is always born into a family belonging to the Ksatriya varna, the social class of warriors and kings. Put otherwise, the 23 Cort, Liberation and Wellbeing (n. 6 above), esp. chap. 8. 24 See Dundas, The Jains (n. 6 above), pp. 31-32; Jaini (n. 3 above), p. 7. 25 For a further exploration of this theme, see Lawrence A. Babb, "Monks and Mira- cles: Religious Symbols and Images of Origin among Osval Jains," Journal of Asian Studies 52 (1993): 3-21. It should be noted that the Buddha was also a potential cakra- vartin. A similar complementation between the roles of cakravartin and the Buddha is explored by S. J. Tambiah in World Conqueror and World Renouncer: A Study of Bud- dhism and Polity in Thailand against a Historical Background (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), esp. chap. 4. 24</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions Tirthankar renounces earthly kingship to become a spiritual king. Kingly martial valor is transposed to a transcendental plane; instead of victory over earthly sovereigns, the Tirthankar becomes a "victor" (jina) over attachments and aversions. Asceticism thus turns out to be a spiritualized martial virtue.26 In a sense, cakravartin and Tirthankar invert each other; by conquering all, the cakravartin devours the whole world, whereas the Tirthankar renounces it completely.27 Why are the fourteen dreams reiterated so frequently? I suggest that part of the reason is that they dramatize a basic choice embedded deeply in the Jain way of looking at the world: asceticism versus worldly felicity. The Tirthankar's spiritual kingship is the highest man- ifestation of the ascetic path. Others, however, prosper in the world and use their worldly wealth and power to serve ascetics, and, by im- plication, those who serve ascetics prosper in the world. Worldly king- ship, rejected by the Tirthankar, is the highest manifestation of this latter path, which is dramatized by the heavenly projections of earthly kingship, the Indras and Indranis who are the kings and queens of the gods. It is, as well, the path of nonascetic Jains, who, as worshipers, identify with the kings and queens of heaven. Having renounced earthly kingship, the Tirthankar becomes a king of the spirit who is worshiped by kings, both heavenly and earthly. Those who inhabit human bodies find themselves at the crossing point of these two paths. Unlike the gods, humans can be ascetics. Those who take ascetic vows, on the other hand, cannot (as do the gods) worship with material things; being possessionless, they have nothing to offer.28 Lay Jains are in a perpetual condition of being able to choose. They can worship with material things, but they can also perform the varied acts of temporary asceticism for which Jainism is justly famed. Indeed, for pious Jains life is, in effect, a constant oscil- lation between these two modes of praxis. This same doubleness is replicated in possible interpretations of the act of worship itself. At the heart of the act of worship is an unstable metaphor based on kingship. The worshiper takes the role of wealthy and powerful Indra (or Indrani). The ritually adopted persona of Indra carries with it the image of worldly well-being, and this fits well with the worshiper's expectation that worship will result in earthly versions 26 On which point see Paul Dundas, "The Digambara Jain Warrior," in Carrithers and Humphrey, eds., esp. pp. 173-74. 27 And, at least in Digambar tradition, the Tirthankar "devours" nothing, for the Di- gambars hold that the Tirthankar does not eat. See Paul Dundas, "Food and Freedom: The Jaina Sectarian Debate on the Nature of the Kevalin," Religion 15 (1985): 163-88. 28 Ascetics, however, do indeed engage in worship in a more general sense. They can perform bhdv pija and can also participate in congregational worship as observers and singers. But dravya puja is barred. 25</page><page sequence="12">The Great Choice of heavenly felicity (or even in heavenly rebirth). But the problem is that, although the worshiper's well-being is given due recognition, the ascetic's path alone possesses unquestioned legitimacy. As a result, normative interpretations of the ritual act emphasize mimesis. Meta- phor gets tightened into actual analogy; the worshiper's identity as a regal deity gives way to the idea that he is a renouncer who imitates his spiritual king, and kingly largess becomes the ascetic's giving up.29 The worshiper's role is finally ambiguous. Who is the worshiper? The matter is never quite settled. At one level the worshiper is power- ful and prosperous, but this image is challenged by the ascetic's values. This is reflected in the confusions and evasions about the fruits of wor- ship that we noted earlier. Among Jaipur's Svetambar Jains, however, there is another domain of religious practice in which the worshiper's role is recast in a much more stable form. Here worship is focused not on the Tirthankars, but on certain ascetics of the more recent past. DECEASED ASCETICS At a place called Mohan Bari on Galta Road in Jaipur is a Svetambar temple complex. It is not this community's most important temple, but it is of great interest to us because it exhibits a range of diverse ritual subtraditions in close physical juxtaposition. The main shrine is dedi- cated to Rsabh (also called Adinath), who was the first Tirthankar of our era and region of the world. He is represented (unusually for a Tirthankar) by a pair of footprints (carans) carved in stone. The other structures in the complex do not contain representations of the Tirthankars at all; rather, they are shrines dedicated to various monks and nuns of the past. One shrine contains an image of Santi Vijay, a monk famous for his miracles who died in 1943. There is also a large structure at the spot where the last rites were performed for a much- beloved Khartar Gacch nun named Vicaksansri who died in 1980. Within is her very lifelike image, protected by a glass case. A similar shrine is currently under construction nearby for a nun named Sajjansri who died in 1989. Yet another shrine houses the footprint images of four very distinguished Khartar Gacch monks, known as Dadagurus, who lived centuries ago. There are foot images of other deceased monks and nuns as well. The representations of all these ascetics of the past are objects of worship.30 It seems, then, that in addition to the 29 This latter theme, in fact, precisely echoes what is called the varsi dan, the potlatch- like year of gift giving in which a Tirthankar-to-be, still a worldly prince, gives away everything before becoming an ascetic. 30 Santi Vijay's image and the various foot images of other ascetics are given full rites of worship daily by the temple's pujari on his normal morning rounds. Vicaksansri's im- age is worshiped less formally. 26</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions Tirthankars, certain other ascetic figures are also considered worthy of representation and worship in temples and shrines by Svetambar Jains. Among Jains associated with the Khartar Gacch the most important of these figures are the Dadagurus.31 The Dadagurus are past Khartar Gacch acdryas who are singled out from others because of their roles as defenders and reformers of Jainism, and as miracle workers and creators of new Jains. The four are Jindattsiri (1075-1154 c.E.), Jin- candrasuri "Manidhari" (1140-1166), Jinkusalsuri (1280-1332), and Jincandrasuri II (1541-1613). These figures are the focus of a wide- spread cult.32 Most temples affiliated with the Khartar Gacch contain images of the Dadagurus. There are also many shrines-called dadabaris, "gardens of the Dada"-dedicated specifically to them. Even in ddadbaris, how- ever, images of the Tirthankars are present and, in theory, are the pri- mary objects of worship. The Dadagurus are usually worshiped as foot images, but anthropomorphic images have become more common in recent times.33 It is clear, however, that footprints are more fundamen- tally in character for the Dadagurus than anthropomorphic images, be- cause even when there is an anthropomorphic image there are usually footprints too.34 The structures in which the Dadagurus' images are housed are modeled on funerary chatris, the umbrella-like memorial structures that cover the footprints of deceased individuals of note. Even where temple-like buildings have been erected for the Dadagurus, their images, whether footprints or anthropomorphic figures, are usu- ally housed in chatri-like shrines within. 31 On the Dadagurus, see also Babb, "Marks and Miracles"; and Laidlaw, "Profit, Sal- vation, and Profitable Saints" (n. 16 above). The term dada means "grandfather"; guru means "spiritual preceptor." 32 An early precedent for the Dadagurus' cult may have been the cult of Gautama (Ma- havir's foremost disciple and usually called Gautam Svami by Svetambar Jains), which had emerged among Svetambars by medieval times and was associated, as the Dadagu- rus' cult is today, with worldly prosperity. See Dundas, The Jains, pp. 33-34. Unlike the Dadagurus, however, Gautama has achieved liberation. For an excellent description and analysis of Gautama's role in contemporary Svetambar ritual, see the final chapter of James Laidlaw's forthcoming book, Gentle Conquest: Religion, Economy and Society among the Jains. 33 The latter can be easily distinguished from images of the Tirthankars by the pres- ence of three symbols: the muhpatti, the ogha, and the book. The muhpatti is the cloth that ascetics hold before their mouths when speaking to avoid harming small living things in the air; the ogha is the moplike implement that ascetics use to brush surfaces free of small life-forms before sitting or lying. The book symbolizes the teaching func- tion of ascetics. 34 There is nothing uniquely Jain in the emphasis on feet. From early times the Bud- dha was represented by footprints. Ritual attention to the feet of deities and ascetics is a pan-Indian theme. See Lawrence A. Babb, Redemptive Encounters: Three Modern Styles in the Hindu Tradition (Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1986), esp. chap. 3, for Hindu examples. 27</page><page sequence="14">The Great Choice The most famous dadabiris are those at Ajmer, Mehrauli (near Delhi), and Malpura (some 80 kilometers southeast of Jaipur).35 The dadabaris at Ajmer and Mehrauli are located on the spots where, re- spectively, Jindattsuri's and Jincandraslri Manidhari's obsequies took place. The dadabari at Malpura was supposedly founded as a result of a vision that Jinkusalsiri gave only fifteen days after his death (to be discussed below). It is clear that dadabaris are basically mortuary structures. Although many of them have been enveloped by urban growth, the ideal is for a dddbadri to be away from population centers, as would be appropriate for a place where funerary rites take place. The complex at Mohan Bari, basically a daddbdri-like temple, func- tions in this way today. We may say that deceased ascetics constitute a general class of objects of worship. The Dadagurus are different in degree from other deceased monks, not different in kind. They are the most beloved, re- spected, and powerful of them all, but other ascetics have achieved posthumous recognition too. The Tirthankars can also be seen as mem- bers of this class, but this statement requires clarification. The distinc- tion between the Tirthankars and ordinary deceased ascetics is never in doubt for Jains; the Tirthankars have achieved omniscience and libera- tion, whereas (as we shall see) even ascetics as distinguished as the Dadagurus have not. The mahdmantra establishes a clear hierarchy among ascetics, with the Tirthankars unambiguously at the top. None- theless, Tirthankars are also deceased ascetics. As noted before, Rsabh is represented at Mohan Bari by footprints, not by an anthropomorphic image. Moreover, these footprints are stationed under a chatri-like structure. This is an unusual arrangement, but the fact that it is a plau- sible arrangement suggests that in some respects the Tirthankars are thought of as belonging to the same category as other deceased ascet- ics.36 The physical homologies seen in the arrangements at Mohan Bari suggest a common conceptual substratum. Rsabh, too, is a de- ceased ascetic who has left his footprints behind. RDDHISAR'S PUJA Worship of the Dadagurus is extremely popular among Jaipur's Svetambar Jains. In fact, their worship is the principal religious activ- ity of many Jains, and even members of the non-temple-going sects (the Sthanakvasis and Terapanthis) sometimes visit their shrines.37 The 35 An all-India survey of dadabarzs is to be found in Madanlal Josi, ed., Dadavdri- Digdarsan (Bombay: Pratapmal Sethiya [Srijindattsuri Seva Sangh], 1962). 6 Other temples in which the Tirthankar is represented by footprints rather than an image are rare. The best-known example is at Pavapuri, where Lord Mahavir is said to have achieved nirvdn. 37 It is rare, however, for Digambar Jains to worship the Dadagurus. 28</page><page sequence="15">History of Religions reason for the Dadagurus' popularity is simple: they are powerful be- ings to whom one can appeal directly for assistance in one's worldly affairs. Moreover, there seems to be little effort to obfuscate the goal of gaining assistance in one's worldly affairs from the Dadagurus. Al- though some of my informants claimed to worship the Dadagurus solely for reasons such as "peace of mind,"38 most devotees spoke with unembarrassed candor about the material fruits of worshiping the Dadagurus. The general view is that they will give you wealth, health, success in business, or whatever you desire. Verses recited in their worship compare them to the kalp taru, the wish-fulfilling tree, or to the fabled cintamani, the jewel that grants all desires. The Dadagurus are able to render assistance to their worshipers be- cause they, unlike the Tirthankars, are unliberated. They are powerful and virtuous ascetics who, after death, ascended to heaven; after a so- journ there, they will return to human bodies and achieve final release. In the meantime they are, as the Tirthankars are not, present in samsar, the world of unliberated beings; as a result, they can and do engage in transactions with worshipers. Moreover, not only are the Dadagurus able to assist their worshipers, but the tradition stresses their function as helpers of Jains in trouble. These are points to which we shall return. The Dadagurus are worshiped in various ways. Most commonly, dev- otees simply drop by a temple or dadabari to take the Dadagurus' darsan (auspicious vision).39 We should note that, in doing so, devotees must honor the Tirthankars' images before approaching the Dadagurus. This rule acknowledges the Tirthankars' supremacy. While taking darsan, devotees often sing a text such as the Dadaguru Iktisa (a standard nan- egyric of thirty-one verses).40 Visitors might also perform a complete rite of worship, which is typically a version of the astprakdri pauj. Be- cause Monday is a day of special importance for the Dadagurus, dada- bdris tend to be quite crowded on Monday evenings. Young people (especially young men) are present in large numbers, which suggests that the cult of the Dadagurus is currently in a flourishing state. There are also special occasions. For example, at a dadabdar near my residence 38 I think this may have reflected a desire to give the foreign investigator a "correct" version of Jainism, which in the minds of many Jains would definitely have nothing to do with such material benefits as wealth. Peace of mind (in Hindi, man ki santi) seems to be a generic respectable religious goal in South Asia. 39 For a description of the routines at a typical dadabarl, see Laidlaw, "Profit, Salva- tion, and Profitable Saints." 40 The Iktisa is a Jain imitation of the Hindus' famed Hanuman Cdlisd. Composed in 1951 by someone who identifies himself in the colophon as Srigopal, the text bears strong stylistic resemblances to the Calisd. (I thank Philip Lutgendorf for confirming this point.) The Dadagurus are praised as sankat mocan (one who liberates from dangers and difficulties), which is an epithet of Hanuman, and the text is to be recited 108 times in the morning, as is the Calisa. Most important, both texts focus on worldly benefits to be gained by the worshiper. 29</page><page sequence="16">The Great Choice in Jaipur, an all-night bhajan-singing session (jagran) was held every full-moon night. Many dadabaris sponsor annual fairs (melis). In addi- tion, individuals or individual families often sponsor special rites of worship for the Dadagurus. This is frequently done in fulfillment of a vow made to the Dadagurus in hopes of getting their assistance in some worldly matter. The standard rite performed on special occasions for the Dadagurus is known as the dadaguru bari piij, which means the Dadagurus' great (bari) rite of worship (piujd). Its focus is an image or images of the Dadagurus, and it is usually performed in a temple. It consists of a total of eleven ritual acts. The first eight are a version of the astprakdri pijd: the image (or foot image) is bathed, anointed with sandalwood paste, and then receives the usual offerings of flowers, incense, lamp, rice, sweets, and fruit. Then follow offerings of cloth, flags, and a final liba- tion. The rite ends with a ceremony (arati) in which a lamp is circled be- fore the image, the standard exit act for major rites of worship. In contrast to the astprakdri pija, this rite is designed to be per- formed by a group.41 There are two kinds of participants. A small num- ber of individuals perform the ritual acts. They must be bathed and dressed appropriately for actual contact with the images. The other par- ticipants, usually the majority, remain seated and sing specified devo- tional songs drawn from a standard text before each of the ritual acts is performed.42 The rite thus consists of eleven separate ritual acts (plus the lamp ceremony at the end), each preceded by devotional songs. The rite's text, which is easy for performers to follow, was written about ninety years ago by a yati (a type of semimendicant who does not take the full vows of an ascetic) who signs himself Rddhisar.43 The rite begins with a sequence known as sthipni, for which appro- priate stanzas are included in Rddhisar's text. While these stanzas are sung, a coconut to which currency has been attached is placed on a svastik mark on the floor. The ostensible purpose of sthdpna is to in- voke a deity's presence, and this is its object in Hindu rites. But al- though a sthapna sequence of some kind is performed at the beginning of all major Jain rites of worship, this is clearly a problematical act for Jains because the Tirthankars cannot be present. It is probably for this reason that, as far as I am aware, in this Jain tradition sthdpnd verses are not included in the actual texts of rites of worship directed at the Tirthankars. The fact that Rddhisar included such verses in his text 41 This is not unusual. Many major Jain pijas are designed for congregational performance. 42 Additional devotional songs, not in the text, are often added. 43 The printed version used in preparing this article was Rddhisar, Sridada Gurudev ki Pujd (Calcutta: Sri Jain Upasray Committee, 1962). 30</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions reflects the crucial idea that the Dadagurus, in contrast to the Tir- thankars, can indeed be present in some sense at the site of a ritual. After this preliminary, the rite properly speaking begins. The first two songs (preceding the image's bath) describe the line of disciplic succession (not given in its entirety) connecting the Dadagurus with Sudharma, who was one of Lord Mahavir's eleven chief disciples. The point of this is to establish a connection between the Dadagurus and the sole true source of the highest sacredness in the Jain world: the Tirthankar. The text goes on to mention the founding of the Khartar Gacch (the mendicant lineage of the Dadagurus) and some of its most illustrious early figures. Following this are brief references to the birth, parentage, and gotras (clans) of the four Dadagurus plus allusions to some of their miracles. At this point the singing of the text ceases, af- ter which one of the participants utters a formula (mantra) of offering. At this point the image is bathed, which is the first of the eleven phys- ical acts of the rite. From this point on, the rite's text is mostly a compilation of the many miracles performed by the Dadagurus. As far as I can determine, most of the miracles mentioned in the rite's first eight sections (up to phal pujd, the offering of fruit) are, in legend, associated with the first Dadaguru, Jindattsiri. The three later Dadagurus are more prominent in the later sections of the text, and in this sense the rite's organization is semihistorical. (The very last miracle mentioned in the entire text, however, is Jindattsuri's restoration of sight to a blind man in Surat.) From the organization of the text, I strongly suspect that it was origi- nally designed as a rite of worship of the standard eight parts (i.e., rep- licating the astprakdri pujd), probably dedicated to Jindattsiri. At some point other material got added. But most important to devotees who sing this text today are the miracles themselves, and not the order in which they occurred, or even which Dadaguru was responsible for which ones. The basic idea is that this same miraculous power can work for the benefit of those who perform the rite. MIRACLES The miracles mentioned by Rddhisar's text are many.44 Space does not permit a discussion of all of them, but it is important to note some gen- eral themes. Some of the miracles mentioned involve the protection of pious Jains. The text recalls, for example, how Jindattsiiri once saved a 44 Other sources (hagiographies such as Agarcand Nahta [presumed author], Dadd Guru Caritra [Caro Dada Sahab ka Sanksipt Jivan] [Ajmer: Sri Jindattsuri Mandal, 1988]; and clan histories, to be cited below) mention miracles not included in Rddhisar's text. The major miracles are well known to devotees. One reason for this is that ddad- bdris are often decorated with pictures illustrating the best-known miracles. 31</page><page sequence="18">The Great Choice group of Jain laymen from a bolt of lightning by trapping it under his pdtra (the bowl in which mendicants receive food from laypersons). Several of the miracles have to do with subduing non-Jain supernatural powers. An example is a celebrated incident in which Jindattsuri sub- dued sixty-four yoginis in the city of Ujjain; they became his followers and offered him boons. Another similar instance is Jindattsiri's subduing of the five pirs of the five rivers of Punjab; these Muslim spirits likewise granted boons.45 The Dadagurus also miraculously vanquish Jainism's human enemies, such as Brahmans and Muslim clergy. The text men- tions an incident in which Brahmans placed a dead cow in front of a Jain temple; Jindattsuri caused the cow to rise and expire once more in front of a Hindu temple.46 Jincandrasuri II, who is believed to have had great influence over Akbar, once confounded a hostile Kaji by turning a new- moon night into a full-moon night (by throwing a platter). Finally, and of great significance, many of the miracles are associ- ated with the conversion of non-Jains into Jains. The text tells of how Jindattsuri quelled a cholera epidemic in Vikrampur, which resulted in many conversions and diksas (initiations of monks and nuns). He cured a prince of leprosy; the king and 10,000 families then became Jains. He converted Cauhan, Bhati, Pamar, Inda, Rathor, Sisodiya, and Solanki kings. He cured various diseases, and Brahmans, Ksatriyas, and Mahesvaris became Jains. The text asserts that he created 130,000 laymen linked with the Khartar Gacch. It is clear that the conversions of non-Jains into Jains have a special place in Rddhisar's text. Although the text is not very well structured, the section leading up to the offering of fruit differs from others. We have already seen that the offering of fruit plays a special role in Jain worship. It is the last act of the astprakari pajd and is said to represent liberation, the rite's "fruit." In Rddhisar's text, the section of the rite in which fruit is offered (phal pujd) is exclusively concerned with con- versions, and nowhere else in the text are references to conversions so abundant. By implication, Jain clans are the ultimate fruit of the Dadagurus' endeavors. It should be pointed out that although conversions from many castes are referred to in the text, the emphasis here (and in other sources too) is on conversions from the Ksatriya varna, and more specifically, from the 45 On the five pirs, see William Crooke, The Popular Religion and Folk-Lore of North- ern India (1896; reprint, New Delhi: Munshiram Manoharlal, 1978), 1:202-3, 206. He sug- gests that they are possibly Muslimized versions of the Mahabharata's five Pandavas. 46 The temple was a Siva temple. The incident thus reflects the competition between Jains and Hindu Saivas of that era. In another miracle, not mentioned in Rddhisar's text, Jindattsuri brings Siva under his control. In a vision arranged by the Dadaguru, the god informs a Pamar (Rajput) king that, if he wishes to attain liberation, he should follow Jindattsuri's orders (this from Agarcand Nahta and Bhanvarlal Nahta, Jaindcdrya Prati- bhodit Gotram evam Jatiya [Palitana: Sri Jinharisagarsuri Jain Bhandar, 1978], p. 42). 32</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions Rajput caste. The Rajputs are the martial aristocracy of Rajasthan; the name itself means "sons of kings." Most members of Jaipur's Svetambar community consider themselves to be descended from Rajpiits who were converted to Jainism by distinguished monks, especially Dadaguru Jin- dattsuiri. Clan histories of the Osval caste, the majority caste in this com- munity, contain numerous accounts of such conversions.47 These stories tend to fall into a pattern.48 A Rajput, often a king or chieftain, is in trouble of some kind-snakebite, illness, the threat of military defeat, or the like. A powerful monk, who often just happens to be nearby, saves the situation by means of a miracle. His special powers having been demonstrated, the monk converts the Rajput to Jainism, and his descen- dants become one of the many Osval clans (gotras). ASCETICS AS GODS How does the Dadagurus' worship differ from the Tirthankar worship seen previously? If we focus on worshipers themselves, there is hardly any difference at all. Here those who worship are the same laymen and women playing the same role as admirers and supporters of ascetics. What differs is the object of worship. The Dadagurus are in some ways Tirthankar-like. They are deceased ascetics who are linked to the last Tirthankar by disciplic succession. But at the same time they are not, in fact, Tirthankars, and there is no confusion about this in the minds of worshipers. Indeed, it is precisely that they are not Tirthankars that accounts for their popularity as objects of worship. Although the Dadagurus' worship consists of basically the same acts, they are per- formed within a significantly different frame of reference. Perhaps the most striking difference is that soteriology is replaced by what seems to be its opposite, the miraculous fulfillment of worldly desires. As we have seen, normative interpretations of the astprakdri puja stress the themes of renunciation and liberation. The text of the Dadagurus' worship, however, is focused on magic. In the hagiogra- phies the magic tends to be rationalized as a means of enhancing the fortunes of Jainism (jain sdsan ki vrddhi). But, when all is said and done, the emphasis of the magic is material aid to individuals, and this idea is at the heart of Dadaguru worship. Long ago the Dadagurus came to the aid of Jains or Jains-to-be in times of great difficulty. The posi- tion of the worshiper now is analogous to that of those whom the Dadagurus aided then; they too hope for the Dadagurus' miraculous 47 As found, e.g., in such modern works as Sohanraj Bhansali, Osval Vams', Anu- sandhan ke Alok me (Jodhpur: Kusalam Jain Granthalaya, 1982); Mangilal BhFtoriya, Osval Itihas ki Amar Bel (Calcutta: Priyadargi Prakasan, 1988), and Nahta and Nahta. 48 For an analysis of this genre, see Phyllis Granoff, "Religious Biography and Clan History among the Svetambara Jains in North India," East and West 39 (1989): 195-215; also Babb, "Monks and Miracles" (n. 25 above). 33</page><page sequence="20">The Great Choice assistance. It is therefore possible to say that liberation from worldly fears and problems49 replaces liberation from the world's bondage as a central theme in the Dadagurus' cult. The theme of world renunciation is also given a different context in the cult of the Dadagurus. The Dadigurus are indeed ascetics, but their asceticism is decoupled from soteriological ends and instead linked with magical powers. In the Dadagurus' modern hagiographies50 their magi- cal abilities are directly associated with asceticism; their powers, for example, are called yogbal (power of yoga), or tapobal (power of ascet- icism).51 These magical powers, in turn, are connected directly with the worldly well-being of those whom the Dadagurus assist; indeed this is the entire reason for being of their cult. While worship of the Tirthankars tends to be rationalized as an act of renunciation (tyag), the Dadagurus' worship is based on the desire for miraculous intervention in one's worldly affairs; it is about getting things, not giving things up. Finally, the worship of the Dadagurus is not reflexive; the benefits bestowed come from the object of worship, not from the worshiper (as in the case of the astprakarl puijd).52 As noted before, this is possible because the Dadagurus, unlike the Tirthankars, are unliberated and are therefore present in the world and available for transactions with wor- shipers. Their worldly presence is signaled in several ways in the rite itself. The inclusion of sthdpnd stanzas in the rite's text reflects the sense that they can actually be invoked at the site of a rite of worship. Moreover, although rice is offered to the Dadagurus as it is to the Tirthankars, there is a significant difference in the way it is offered. In the case of the Dadagurus, the crescent and dot at the top of the diagram (standing for liberation) are omitted and replaced by a representation of a flag, an explicit acknowledgment of their unliberated state.53 The difference between the Dadagurus and the Tirthankars is espe- cially evident in the treatment of food offerings. As we have seen, when food is offered in the astprakdrl pijd, it is never recovered by worship- ers and consumed; according to the ambient ideology of the rite, the 49 Typical phrasings from the Hindi hagiographies expressing this idea are bhay se mukt karna (to liberate from fear) and dukh se mukt karnd (to liberate from sorrow). The term mukt, of course, can also mean "liberated" in the soteriological sense. 50 Such as Agarcand Nahta. 51 In this context these writings also sometimes refer to the Dadagurus' jndnbal, their "power of knowledge." 52 It is true that devotees stress that positive results will come only to those who wor- ship with the appropriate devotional spirit (bhdv); results will come to the "faithful" (sraddhdlu), it is sometimes said. Nonetheless, the actual aid comes from the Dadagurus themselves. 53 On various occasions I have seen worshipers err by forming the conventional cres- cent used in Tirthankar worship. I have also witnessed such erring worshipers being cor- rected by others. 34</page><page sequence="21">History of Religions food is renounced, not offered in the expectation of transformation and return. In the case of the Dadagurus, however, food offerings are indeed recovered and consumed. The only prohibition that seems to apply is that the retrieved offerings should not be consumed within the temple or shrine itself. Sometimes devotees simply take the offered sweets out of ?the temple at the end of a rite, but experienced ritualists have told me that a more acceptable procedure is for only a small portion of the offer- ing to be taken into the temple; some incense ash can then be taken from the Dadagurus' altar and sprinkled on the larger portion remaining outside, which can be distributed to devotees. But, however it is done, the fact that the Dadagurus are unliberated means that they, unlike the Tirthankars, can confer blessings through returned offerings. Indeed, so "present" are the Dadagurus in their worshipers' world that individuals sometimes encounter them in person. Certain dddi- baris are reputed to be especially miraculous (camatkari), and one of these is the dadaibari at Malpura mentioned earlier.54 This didabari originated in a miraculous fashion. According to one version, fifteen days after Dadaguru Jinkusalsuri's death at Deraur (now in Pakistan), he miraculously appeared to a Brahman at Malpura and indicated where a stone with his footprints was buried. The ddaibdri was then estab- lished with these footprints as the principal objects of worship, and the descendants of the Brahman became the shrine's pujaris (caretakers).55 Jinkusalsuri still frequents the vicinity. At this same dadaibari a devotee told me of how he once got lost in the darkness while on a pilgrimage there from Jaipur. He was approached by a small boy, dressed in white, who pointed out the way; this was Jinkusalsuri. Reports of such sight- ings are common, especially of Jinkusalsuri, who seems to have a spe- cial propensity for visual manifestations. The Dadagurus are visualized as ascetics in their posthumous state. I have no survey data on visions of the Dadagurus, but most informants seem to believe that when they appear they appear as ascetics.56 The white dress in the abovementioned appearance suggests mendicant garb. In a frequently reproduced picture of a posthumous miracle in 54 The dddabdris at Ajmer and Mehrauli are also believed to be quite miraculous. 55 I was told this version at Malpura. In the version reported in JoSi (n. 35 above) the recipient of the vision is identified only as a "disciple" (sisya). I was also told that the descendants of the Brahman are no longer the pujdris of the temple, having been dis- placed when the temple's management was shifted from Malpura to Jaipur some years ago. It should be noted that a pujari in a Jain temple is not actually a priest (as among Hindus). Although the pujdri can worship the images if nobody else is around to do so, he is regarded as a rather lowly sort of temple servant. 56 The Malpura pujari, however, hinted that Jinkusalsuri has manifested himself in the form of a snake. While I am sure that other examples of such reports can be found, they do not accord with what seems to be the general view that the Dadaigurus manifest them- selves in ascetic form. 35</page><page sequence="22">The Great Choice which Jinkusalsuri rescued a sinking boat, the Dadaguru is portrayed as a mendicant, floating among the clouds in the sky and saving the boat with a beam of force emanating from his upraised right hand.57 And in one line of Rddhisar's text one of the Dadagurus manifests him- self in white clothes with a saffron mark on his forehead and wearing a garland of flowers.58 When I asked a knowledgeable friend about this latter line, he pointed out that this is simply what people see when they see the Dadagurus' images-that is, images of ascetics with marks of worship-in temples. At first glance these manifestations of Dadagurus as ascetics seem to pose a puzzle. The Dadagurus become gods after death, but gods, as we know, cannot be ascetics. When I raised this issue with friends and acquaintances, they saw the point of my query; it was clear, however, that they had never given much thought to the matter. One friend remarked in response that the Dadagurus "appear as we remember them," by which he meant that they are remembered as they were in life-as ascetics. It would seem, therefore, that in the imaginations of devotees, the Dadagurus represent figures in whom the identities of as- cetic and deity are somehow quite unproblematically fused. I suggest that this is an important fact. What kind of beings are the Dadagurus? We know that they are pow- erful ascetics to whom Jains (or Jains-to-be) can appeal for aid.59 But in this they are not unique, for they are not the only powerful beings to whom Jains appeal directly for assistance in worldly matters. As we have seen, the Jain pantheon includes various deities who will also come to the aid of pious devotees. In this sense the Dadagurus are sim- ply part of a larger pantheon of unliberated deities. In fact, they are often called Gurudev or Dadagurudev, the term dev meaning "deity." Frequently the term devatma is used to describe the Dadagurus in post- humous manifestations. Many of my informants compared the Dadagu- rus directly to the Tirthankars' attendant deities (adhisthayak devs) and the Bhairavs who guard temple precincts. One knowledgeable friend stated that the Dadagurus are much like Ghantakarn Mahavir, a Jain deity celebrated for his powers and especially popular in Gujarat. But the matter does not end here. The cult of the Dadagurus has a centrality in the religious life of Jaipur's Svetambar Jains that other un- liberated deities do not, and this is something that has to be explained. I 57 Kantisagar Maharaj Sahab, Sri Jin Guru Gun Sacitra Pusp Mala (Namor [Rajast- han]: Sri Kanti Darsan Jfin Mandir, n.d.), illustration 22, and found in many other collections. 58 Dhvaj paja (Rddhisar [n. 43 above], verse 4). 59 In fact, it is usually held that the Dadagurus will assist anyone, of whatever reli- gion, who comes to them with a sincere heart. 36</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions suggest that the reason is that, although they are deities, they are not merely deities like any others. The crucial difference is that they are be- ings who behave as deities but, because they are ascetics, belong to the category of beings who are (unlike deities) truly worthy of worship. The tendency of devotees to visualize the Dadagurus, even in their present state, as ascetics is a significant datum. It indicates that, in the minds of devotees, the Dadagurus' mendicant status is crucial to who they are. They are powerful beings who aid their worshipers. Their power, however, is linked to their asceticsm. Their asceticism, in turn, connects them-through a mendicant lineage (as Rddhisar's text as- serts)-to Lord Mahavir, the last Tirthankar of our region and era. The Tirthankars are the very model of worship-worthiness. Thus, through the links of this chain, the Dadagurus are beings in whom helpful magical powers and worship-worthiness are connected. This is not true of the other unliberated deities. The Dadagurus therefore offer the possibility of pursuing worldly interests through a mode of worship that, because it is focused on them, is consistent with the tradition's commitment to as- cetic values. It is precisely for this reason that they can be worshiped by means of variations of the astprakdrl pijd. I know of no other "deities" for whom this is the case. It is sometimes said, often by Jains themselves, that the cults of the other helpful deities are simply Hinduistic add-ons: sops to the igno- rant, and not truly Jain. Whether this is true or not, it points to the truly essential thing about the Dadagurus' role in the tradition to which they belong. As beings in whom the attributes of ascetics and deities are fused, they provide a way of seeking worldly help from powerful be- ings that is fundamentally in tune with Jainism's dominant values. When Jains worship the Tirthankars they are in contact with eter- nity. The actions performed and the roles taken have always existed, and will always exist, in the beginningless and endless repetitions of cosmic time. At this level the tradition is focused on the timeless pre- dicament of the unliberated soul's wanderings in samsar. When Jains worship the Dadagurus, these acts and roles are duplicated, but on a different plane; they are brought into connection with the world in which worshipers actually live. The Tirthankars create, and eternally recreate, the fourfold order of Jain society. By contrast, the Dadagurus were the creators of historical Jain clans.60 Those who worship the Tirthankars are archetypal Indras and Indranis, the kings and queens of the gods. Those who worship the Dadagurus are the sons and daughters of kings who became Jains when powerful monks came to their aid. 60 This is not, of course, to accept the historicity of clan origin mythology. But the clans exist. 37</page><page sequence="24">The Great Choice The Dadagurus' worship transvalues Jainism's great choice. In a dis- cussion of the Rajpit origin of the Osvals, an Osval friend once re- minded me of the Tirthankars; they, he said, "were all Rajputs too." His observation points to an obvious (though culturally implicit) parallel: just as the Tirthankar renounces one kind of kingship for another, those who were converted by the Dadagurus likewise renounced a tradition of warrior-kingship to become lay Jains. When Jains worship the Tir- thankars, they confront this choice as it is manifested at the level of orthodox ideology: to be Indra (or Indrani), or to adopt, as normative interpretations prefer, the values of the ascetic. Herein lie the tension and ambiguity inherent in the role of one who worships the Tirthankars. In turn, when lay Jains worship the Dadagurus, their identity as ex- warrior-kingly Rajpits comes to the fore. But since part and parcel of that identity is the idea of being magically helped by powerful monks- as the ancestors of Jain clans were long ago-the pressure of ascetic valules is relaxed. Worshipers thus can pursue overtly worldly goals. The study of Jainism has too long languished under the impression that this complex tradition is basically a soteriology with lay identity added as a kind of afterthought. In this article I have endeavored to show how worldly and otherworldly values have been brought into a culturally viable fusion within a specific Jain ritual culture. The cult of the Dadagurus integrates the religious tradition to which it belongs, and in so doing brings Jainism's goal of final liberation, always central to this tradition, into contact with the social and material world inhab- ited by an actual Jain community. This cult utilizes standard features of Svetambar ritual culture, but it reinterprets this ritual culture and al- ters its context radically. The tradition's abiding commitment to asceti- cism is preserved, but asceticism's role as a means to liberation recedes from view and is overshadowed by asceticism's capacity to generate powers useful in this world. In this way the Dadagurus' cult bridges the gap between the Jainism's highest values and the problems and desires of men and women who must live in the world. Amherst College 38</page></plain_text>
