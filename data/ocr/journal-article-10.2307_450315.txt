The poem's excursions into individual, historical, and natural pasts are leavened by apparently Christian pronouncements, so that early commentators assumed its 'meaning" was Christian.' T'ennyson himself said that the poem was a "sort of Divine Comedy."2 But the persona rejects Christianity's end- determined frame of reference (the millennium, imnmortality) and a conversion to a supernatural order. TIhat is, Christian eschatology is unacceptable because the persona finds divine sanctions for it unavailable, and he cannot affirm it out of mere faith and conviction. Modern criticism, on the other hand, is prone to credit the poem's "meaning" with a profane millenarianism, but this is equally untenable because, for the persona, the historical and natural worlds-causal, purposeful, and "organic" as they may be-are clearly not "meaningful" in terms of an inexorable, emotionally unverified "process." It is true that certain sensibilities may find sequential causality or the fulfillment of teleologically induced form emotionally satisfying, but Tennyson was not one of these. If we equiate "meaning" with God in the context of his thought, we find him atnong the Cambridge Apostles voting "no" on the question, "Is an intelligible First Cause deducible from the phenomena of the tTniverse' (Memoir, I, 44), and in In Memoriam the persona says 'Charles Kingsley in an 1850 review of In Memoriam speaks of it simply as 'the noblest Christian poem which England has produced for two centuries," with TIennyson "led, like Dante of old, by the guiding of a mighty spirit": Tennyson: The (Critical Heritage, ed.

What is apparent from this summary of attitudes toward "meaning"4 is that system and conviction together must make up this term as it is generally understood; a frame of reference is not meaningful unless the user is happy in it, nor is a mere euphoria meaningful if bereft of system. The primary critical problem with the poem today is that modern commentary separates system and conviction and, in the schism, loses the poetn's fundamental significance. There are, on the one hand, studies of the poem's purportedly end-determined frames of reference: variations of the Christian scheme, secular versions, varieties of evolution, and systems of natural law.5 Here, whatever "meaning" the poem proffers is assumed to rise automatically out of such a frame, but two critical conclusions-that Tennyson's faith was a poor one and so he did not really believe in the Christian scheme, and that his thinking powers were not great and so his secular system is a muddle-cloud such 3Tennyson's poetry cited from The Poems of Tennysoni, ed.

John D. Rosenberg says that for the synithesis of the poem, Tennyson "draws on two great myths, the myth of Progress and the Christian sision of the Kingdom of Heaven on Earth," with fennyson "uniting evolutionary scieice and Christian faith," specifically "the evolutionary argument of Sectioni CXVIII (man thriving from clime to clime)": "The Two Kingdoms of In Memoriam," JEGP, 58 (1959), 235, 240, 236. Jonathan Bishop addresses secular eschatology when he says that "sympathy with Hallam's spirit" has shown the persona that "the cycles of nature and history are not 'seeming-random forms,/ The seeming-prey of cyclic storms,' but parts of a slowly spiraling ameliorative progress of which such individuals as Hallam are an inspiring prophecy": "The Unity of In Memoriam," The V'ictorian Newsletter, no. 21 (1962), 13. Valerie Pitt brings into play the issue of natural law and inevitable progress toward an "end" by saying that "the desire for, and the straining towards the vision of the perfect race of man living an idyllic life in bliss and concord was part of the romantic inheritance," but "it was only at this time that it begins to be linked to the laws of the physical and biological sciences": Tennyson Laureate (London, 1962), p. 116.</page><page sequence="3">HENRY KOZICKI 675 explanations and result in the poem being regarded as no meaningful explanation at all. On the other hand, there are studies of the persona's valuational transfiguration-religious, psychological, epistemological, esthetic-that usually focus on the mystical trance of section 95 as an archetypal "conversion."6 "Meaning" here is assumed to be religious exaltation, essentially. Tennyson's system is recognized as a presence in the background but not dealt with, so the poem becomes a psychological or spiritual record rather than "meaning" in the full sense of this term. The upshot of the dichotomy of system and conviction is that the persona's complex peripeteia remains unsatisfactorily explained. As a recent critic says, "With all the commentaries, analyses, and keys which have appeared since 1850 the poem still eludes consensus."7 I propose to argue that the poem shows the persona moving into happiness, finally, not through perceptions of design or supernatu- ralism, but through his developing consciousness, his willed construction of "meaning" in the disastrous past, and his faith in a God that is totally unknown except through this consciousness and this past. Tennyson builds a frame of reference that is not "end- determined" but "open-ended." The free will, in complex interaction with the potentials of the world, does not advance in the determinism "Although Graham Hough discusses the influences of scienice anid C)leridge on Tennyson, he finds the basis of the poem to be "Tennyson's own religious intuitions, based ultimately on an unanalysable but completely cogent mystical experience": "The Natural Theology of In Memoriam," Review of English Studies (Old Series), 23 (1947), 256. Jerome Hamilton Buckley notes that "concern with the mode of perception and the reality of the perceiving self turns the essential 'action' of In Memoriam toward the inner experience," with the trance of section 95, the climax, bringing "renewed purpose and composure"; "the 'I' of the poem finds in his mystical insight the surest warrant for spiritual recovery": Tennyson: The Growth of a Poet (Cambridge, Mass., 1960), pp. 122, 123. Carlisle Moore says that the 'trance-like experience of Section XCV rnarks the climax of the poet's efforts to commune with the spirit of Hallam; it provides a nexus between the disparate elements of doubt and faith": "Faith, Doubt, and Mystical Experience in In Memoriam," Victorian Studies, 7 (1963), 158. Robert Langbaum characterizes the poem as "epistemological sophistication. For In Memoriam is organized to show that after the poet has undergone a total transformation of perception, all the old facts and problems are transvaluated and absorbed into the affirmative movement that dominates the poem from Section XCV on"; the "real turning point" is "where in a mystical trance the poet has the epiphany that transforms and transcends all the problems": The Modern Spirit (New York, 1970), pp. 69, 65. In a recent essay on In Memoriam as a type of "Augustinian confession," W. David Shaw says the trance of section 95 is "truly a turning-point or conversion in Tennyson's spiritual history," behind which lie "concepts like God, eternity, or immortality, theological ideas"; thus the breeze of 95 'is a Romantic equivalent of the Holy Spirit": "In Memoriam and the Rhetroic of Confession," ELH, 38 (1970), 80, 90, 102. 7Carlisle Moore (note 6 above), p. 155.</page><page sequence="4">676 IN MEMORIAM associated with evolutionary or teleological "ends,' but expands in convulsive cycles in an apocalyptic present: the eternity that James in Tennyson's poem "The Golden Year" says is "ever at the doors." Such quantum jumps of spirit-fiery rebirths, the "shattered stalks" of section 82-occur out of disaster and death, so that the conviction that attends this frame is an affirmation, not of faith in a Heavenly Father the author of all things, but of the sorrow of the free human condition. The persona, representing both individual and collective memory, perceives "meaning" as a fusion of self and past in master images, organic and mechanical, that carry the burden of both the system and the conviction. The persona fails to find a supernatural "God" because all avernues to the divine are closed, so that he is, in effect, thrown upon his ownI resources. The poem specifically rejects mysticism, scriptures, and prophecy. What Tennyson understands about God is brought about by the rational process, that "extreme subtlety and curious elaborateness of thought" that Arnold complained of in Tennyson.8 The state into which he was able to throw himself, often cited as mystical, Tennyson called "no nebulous ecstasy, but a state of transcendent wonder, associated with absolute clearness of mind" (Memoir, II, 473-474). He was, as a matter of fact, almost painfully cerebral, curious, and not at all tender-minded in regard to the Ultimates. Most of his remarks on his understanding of "God" reveal the notion of the unavoidable human-ness of divinity, his list of the three "Eternal Truths," for instance: belief in "an Omnipotent, Omnipresent and All-loving God, Who has revealed Himself through the human attribute of the highest self-sacrificing love; in the freedom of the human will; and in the immortality of the soul" (my italics). If these attributes are taken literally, Tennyson would see God revealing Himself in human consciousness, and so it is that God is "unknowable" save that "our highest view of God must be more or less anthropomorphic": the God within (Memoir, I, 311). Tennyson added that "'Personality,' as far as our intelligence goes, is the widest definition and includes 'Mind,' 'Self-consciousness,' 'Will,' 'Love."' The idea of God as Mind, moreover, suggests Tennyson's participation in that thought of the age that saw God manifesting Himself in the movement of collective Mind in history. Tennyson was amused once, said Jowett, "at someone who said of him that he had versified Hegelianism" (Memoir, 1, 312) but, in many ways, this is so. Tennyson said specifically that the persona of In 80n Translating Homer: Last Words, in Critical Heritage (note 1 above), p. 267.</page><page sequence="5">HENRY KOZICKI 677 Memoriam is the "human race":9 collective mind. Any justification of the suffering past of the persona is, thus, extended to history as a whole, particularly if it is only through such "meaning" that God is revealed. Hegel said that his Philosophy of History was to be a "justification of the ways of God," that in Universal History "Spirit displays itself in its most concrete reality," and that "Spirit is Self- contained existence . . . self-consciousness-consciousness of one's own being."'0 The consciousness which can apprehend the "meaning" of the past intuits God, and there is here, thus, both in Tennyson and Hegel, a virtual identity of God, history, and human mind. In Memoriam begins by showing the rupture between this perceiving consciousness and the whole past on the levels of the traditional micro- and macrocosmic correspondences. The persona is in upheaval, his utterances accordingly "wild and wandering" (Prologue). All he sees is without form: the "bald street," the "blank day"; he hears only the "noise of life" (7). In his role as "human race," he experiences the crumbling of social form as "more and more the people throng/ The chairs and thrones of civil power" (21) in social revolution." Nature is correspondingly fragmented: fonight the winds begin to rise And roar from yonder dropping day: The last red leaf is whirled away, The rooks are blown about the skies; The forest cracked, the waters curled. . . (15) Hallam-the apotheosis of disastrous convulsion in the past-is unavailingly "formless in the fold" (22), the focal point throughout the poem for developing consciousness. In the general disorder, the collapse of an "end-determined" frame of reference is almost explicit as the persona falls "Upon the great world's altar-stairs/ That slope through darkness up to God," able only to "stretch lame hands of faith, and grope,/ And gather dust and chaff" (55). If the "end" is no reference point, the origins of rectilinear perspectives are also frustrated. The poet thinks how, when he and Hallam had been together, "all the lavish hills would hum/ The murmur of a happy Pan" in a prelapsarian Eden, "And all we met 9Memoir, I, 305; also Knowles (note 2 above), p. 182.

If all was good and fair we met, This earth had been the Paradise It never looked to human eyes. ... (24) The deepest desolation lies, in fact, in the epistemological confusion: And is it that the haze of grief Makes former gladness loom so great? The lowness of the present state, That sets the past in this relief? Or that the past will always win A glory from its being far; And orb into the perfect star We saw not, when we moved therein? (24) Paradoxical as it may appear in light of the critical view that Tennyson found most congenial an art of "distancing" the world in "ideal forms,"'12 the persona appears to reject perspectives in this "'eternal landscape of the past" (46) as a distorting mode. The "end-determined" frame breaks down because its divine author has become inaccessible as the underpinning of conviction. That the lack of divinity must result in meaninglessness in history is urged by philosophers of history like Lowith, who says that history "is meaningful only by indicating some transcendent purpose beyond the actual facts."'3 To the problem of how, in the effective absence of God, there could be a justification of the disastrous past, Tennyson responds in a radically religious fashion. But, recasting Eliot's observation about the poem in the spirit of modern theology, In Memoriam is not religious because of the quality of its doubt, but because of the quality of its disbelief. 14 Noteworthy is the lack of the 12As given, for instance, by John Dixon Hunt.

To be sure, the Prologue and the epilogue of In Memoriam speak of the "Strong Son of God" and the "God, which ever lives and loves," but these "brackets" were placed late about the poem for dubious reasons (Emily and her family, for instance, still doubted his orthodoxy). Besides, as noted above, Tennyson characterized God as "unknow- able"; he also said, "It's too hopeful, this poem, more than I am myself.'"15 A God there may be, but a "web is woven across the sky" (3). God and immortality are just human desiderata, mirrors: What find I in the highest place, But mine own phantom chanting hymns? And on the depths of death there swims The reflex of a human face, (108) the persona's own. No prophets speak. In a suppressed passage, Tennyson wrote: Hope at awful distance set Oft whispers of a kindlier plan Though never prophet came to man Of such a revelation yet.'6 The dead-Lazarus from his "charnel-cave"-give "no record of reply" (31). As for the alleged spirit-contact with "The living soul"- uncertainly first "his" and then glossed by Tennyson as "perchance of the Diety" '7-the spell is "cancelled, stricken through with doubt" (95). Nor can the "immortality of the soul," the third of Tennyson's Eternal Truths, support an "end-determined" epistemology. The persona's imaginings about Hallam's afterlife appear never to be proffered literally: So hold I commerce with the dead; Or so methinks the dead would say; Or so shall grief with symbols play. ...

'8 "What art thou then?" asks the persona at the end of the poem, "I cannot guess . . . I seem in star and flower/ To feel thee some diffusive power" (130). The persona appears hopeful for some stages of individuation after death but, ultimately, there seems to be oblivion in "light": "Remerging in the general Soul,/ Is faith as vague as all unsweet," but there is only, Upon the last and sharpest height, Before the spirits fade away, Some landing-place, to clasp and say, "Farewell! We lose ourselves in light." (47) Tennyson's utterances were ambiguous on this point, speaking ex cathedra of individuality after death but, as Bradley concluded, "an ultimate 'absorption into the divine' was not, like the idea of an immediate absorption, repugnant to him."'19 With the cutting away of ends and beginnings, of knowledge of God, and of immortality as this is generally understood, the persona is thus that delirious man Whose fancy fuses old and new, And flashes into false and true, And mingles all without a plan. (16) The persona emerges from this slough of meaninglessness by engaging a past that is apocalyptically "open-ended." The world takes on "meaning" when it becomes informed with the anthropo- morphism of the persona's creative imagination, which is, on this microcosmic level, an imitation of God. In reconstructing the suffering past, the persona epistemologically enacts an archetypal ritual whose effect, in Eliade's words, is to "suspend the flow of profane time, of duration, and project the celebrant into a mythical time, in illo tempore." Eliade adds that the archaic ritual-forms '8Modern criticism tends to view Hallam's immortality in this way. Bishop notes that, "so far as Hallam is the object of his surviving friend's contemplations, or the tenor for which these objects are vehicles, he is alive; he cannot, in fact, ever die, for the act of contemplating, itself a living action, becomes immortal by turning it into poetry": "Unity of In Memoriam" (note 5 above), p. 12. '9A. C. Bradley, A Commentary on Tennyson's "In Memoriam" (Hamden, Conn., 1966), p. 53. Yet Bradley underlays his analysis of the poem with an "end-determined" frame of reference by saying that we "must understand by 'immortality' simply the conscious and indefinitely prolonged life of the soul beyond death" (p. 54).</page><page sequence="9">HENRY KOZICKI 681 "grant suffering and historical events a 'normal meaning"' through the restoration of "mythical and primordial time, 'pure' time, the time of the 'instant' of the Creation," and that "Christianity translates the periodic regeneration of the world into a regeneration of the human individual.'"20 The epistemology of this process is of the kind usually associated with the Romantic sensibility and its myth- Inaking predilection. The poet is the medium between the world and divinity. His imaginative creations are, in Wordsworth's language, the "spots of time,," That with distinct pre-eminence retain/ A renovating virtue," epiphanies through which the world becomes meaningful through the "interchangeable supremacy" between nature and mind. The mind here is a "type/ Of a majestic intellect," the "emblem of a mind/ That feeds upon infinity" (The Prelude: XII. 208-210; XIV. 65-84), when to "all this unintelligible world" we "add the gleam,/ The light that never was, oIn sea or land,, The consecration, and the Poet's dream" ("Tintern Abbey," 40; "Peele (Castle Stanzas," 14-15). Keeping in mind that Fennyson said of his "Merlin and the Gleam" that the Gleam "signifies in my poem the higher poetic imagination" (Memoir, II, 366), it can be argued that the past so gathered into synchronic point-time (the eschewing of diachronic perspectives) invariably results in anthropomorphic projections. Frye, for example, referring to Wordsworth's lines about "Paradise" beinig a "simple produce of the common day" when the "discerning intellect of Man" is "wedded to this goodly universe/ In love and holy passion " (from The Recluse, 800-808), speaks of "indirect mytholo- gizing" or "displacement" (the "result of turning one's back on explicit myth"), for art deals with the "world that man creates. The total form of art, so to speak, is a world whose content is nature but whose form is human; hence when it 'imitates' nature it assimilates nature to human forms.''2' I understand this process to be what Abrams, in a recent book on the Romantic spirit, calls the "psycho- historical parallelism" in Christian thought, that results in a "theodicy of the private life." The individual, representing a collective reality, is able, "by consummating a holy marriage with the external universe, to create out of the world of all of us, in a quotidian and recurring miracle, a new world which is the equivalent of paradise." 22 The mind of the persona, then, mediates between the world and divinity, taking its form from both. 2'Mircea Eliade, The Myth of the Eternal Returnt (New York, 1954), pp. 76, 100, 54. 21Northrop Frye, Fables of Identity (New York, 1963), pp. 36, 35, 31. 22M.

The world is dominant and, therefore, empty of form and "meaning." "Sorrow" whispers to the persona, "And all the phantom, Nature, stands- With all the music in her tone, A hollow echo of my own, A hollow form with empty hands," (3) for the persona is passive and anchored to despairing and mundane memory: The wild unrest that lives in woe Would dote and pore on yonder cloud That rises upward always higher, And onward drags a labouring breast, And topples round the dreary west, A looming bastion fringed with fire. (15) He is suspended between the mirrors of inner and outer limits, his "deep self" as "some dead lake/ That holds the shadow of a lark/ Hung in the shadow of a heaven" (16). He is accordingly frozen in stasis, like the "deep vase of chilling tears,/ That grief hath shaken into frost" (4) or the old Yew-an appropriate symbol for the inextricable union of past and present-whose "fibres net the dreamless head" of Hallam, its "roots . . . wrapt about the bones" of a hidden, suffering past (2). The catalyst in the successful fusion of self and past is the firming will, the second of Tennyson's Eternal Truths. The idea, of course, is dominant in In Memoriam, occurring overtly in eleven stanzas and, by suggestion, in many others. From the start, the persona lamented his "helmless bark" and anticipated the wind of change: "With the morning wakes the will, and cries,/ 'Thou shalt not be the fool of loss"' (4). "Slowly forms the firmer mind," he says in section 18, and would "train/ To riper growth the mind and will" (42). The poem is bracketed with the "Our wills are ours, we know not how;/ Our wills are ours, to make them thine" of the Prologue and the "O living will that shalt endure" of section 131 (which Tennyson glossed as the "higher and enduring part of man," Memoir, I, 319). The persona finally does not merely perceive but "faced the spectres of the mind/ And laid them" (96). This will is a kind of Illative Sense (what Newman called the will to believe) that brings new form into being from the interpenetration of</page><page sequence="11">HENRY KOZICKI 683 past and present. The shadow-lark materializes, as though a symbol for the poet's newly developing "scriptures": "Short swallow-flights of song, that dip/ Their wings in tears, and skim away" (48). Later, in section 65 (which Bradley said was 'perhaps the first section of In Memoriam that can be described as cheerful or happy' '23), the bird breaks loose from the agonized chrysalis and becomes autonomous "meaning": a "thought" that somehow is now independent of both the disastrous past and a despairing solipsism. "Out of painful phases wrought/' There flutters up a happy thought,/ Self-balanced on a lightsome wing."24 'The seed and flower imnages also support the idea that the "produce of the common day" results from the complex interaction of present will and the vitality of the past. The "thick noon, disastrous day" (72) of Hallam's death, with "Autumn laying here and there/ A fiery finger on the leaves" (99), "sickened every living bloom" (72), but the potentials of the past- "expectant nature" (83), the "summer in the seed" (105)-meet the embrace of the creative will and Now burgeons every maze of quick About the flowering squares, and thick By ashen roots the violets blow. . . . and in my breast Spring wakens too. . (115) This is not just a "natural" process, nor is the concept of rebirth inherent in such imagery. Eliot in The Waste Land, for instance, found that April is the cruelest month, breeding Lilacs out of the dead land, mixing Memory and desire, stirring Dull roots with spring rain because the natural rebirth mocks the decadent will, which must be the catalyst-that "mind of the poet" of his "Tradition and the Individual Talent" -to bring autonomous and, therefore, artistic 2'Bradley, Commentary, p. 159. 24Tennyson said that "man's Free-will is but a bird in a cage; hecan stopat the lower perch, or he can mount to a higher. Then that which is and knows will enlarge his cage, give him a higher and a higher perch, and at last break off the top of his cage, and let him out to be one with the Free-will of the Universe" (Metnoir, 1, 318-319). This initial flutter is the first of the jumps of spirit that leads "open-endedly" to the God not found on the altar-stairs of section 55.</page><page sequence="12">684 IN MEMORIAM "meaning" as a mix of memory and desire. And much as Eliot's poem is a collective perception, through Tiresias, so Tennyson's persona also acts as a collective memory. The "lower life that earth's embrace/ May breed with" Hallam is a general "virtue out of earth," "transplanted human worth" that "Will bloom to profit, other- where" (82), i.e., in the memory of all men. "From his ashes may be made/ The violet of his native land" (18), dispersed through the race. The Yew may appear as a symbol for the individual persona, but is readily taken also for the familiar Nordic "cosmic life-tree" appearing in so many works in the period, representing all of human time. In Carlyle's 1843 Past and Present (also an effort to fuse 'meaning" out of past essence and present imperatives), "the LIFE- TREE IGDRASIL, wide-waving, many-toned, has its roots down deep in the Death-kingdoms, among the oldest dead dust of man. "Their crumbled dust makes up the soil our life-fruit grows on. Times, Past, Present, Future, watering it from the sacred Well" (1.6; 11.17). What is apparent in this imagery is that the persona realizes he cannot be merely "overworn" (1) by forgetting, but imust base "meaning" on the "old affection of the tomb," that "prime passioll in the grave" (85). This flowering of spirit is "open-ended" but it is also a cyclic return upon itself: a reintegration of the past. The conviction that attends this system, then, is not evolutionary hope at the apogee of the cycle, but the sorrow at the epigee of death and disaster. Though both are part of the ritual reconstruction of time, it is past sorrow and not future hope that invests budding "meaning," just as the cross is the emblem of Christianity and not the open tomb of resurrection. The "wild bird, whose warble, liquid sweet,/ Rings Eden through the budded quicks," does so precisely because "in the midmost heart of grief/ Thy passion clasps a secret joy" (88). Hallam's death accordingly invests almost every station of the persona's progress, just as Christ's death is the focus of the Christian 'meaning" in history. The ancient correspondences are invoked to suggest that Hallam is the apotheosis not only of individual but of historical and natural destruction as well, necessarily if the epistemology of "meaning" is to be universal in the application. Hallam is the genius of such "revolution," for his face is made to mix with hollow masks of night; Cloud-towers by ghostly masons wrought, A gulf that ever shuts and gapes,</page><page sequence="13">HENRY KOZICKI 685 A hand that points, and palled shapes In shadowy thoroughfares of thought; And crowds that stream from yawning doors, And shoals of puckered faces. ... (70) These lines are generally taken to attest to Tennyson's familiarity with Carlyle's The French Revolution, and to this historical Terror, in the lines that immediately follow, is equated the terror of vanished natural species: "Dark bulks that tumble half alive,/ And lazy lengths on boundless shores." Nature cries in section 56, "A thousand types are gone:/ I care for nothing, all shall go," and we seem to be given the historical equivalent: men "Who loved, who suffered countless ills,/ Who battled for the True, the Just." Here, both extinct species and lost civilizations will be "blown about the desert dust,/ Or sealed within the iron hills." Both nature and history, then, are "red in tooth and claw/ With ravine" and it would appear that this is not sweet. Yet Hallam presides: "Looks thy fair face and makes it still" (70). How can this be? Revolution and natural disaster are also equated in section 127, and here too he "O'erlook'st the tumult from afar." Ancient institutions crumble as the "red fool-fury of the Seine" piles "her barricades with dead," and, as to nature: They tremble, the sustaining crags; The spires of ice are toppled down, And molten up, and roar in flood; The fortress crashes from on high, The brute earth lightens to the sky, And the great Aeon sinks in blood. Nothing in the poem suggests that these convulsive ways will ever change. Indeed, these ways are, specifically, the Eternal process moving on, From state to state the spirit walks; And these are but the shattered stalks, Or ruined chrysalis of one. (82) Hallam makes these disasters "still" or meaningful as Eternal Process because he is the seed-core of "meaning" on both the micro- and these macro-cosmic planes, the death-center about which the new epistemology coalesces. On the personal level, Hallam's memory gradually becomes a salutary presence. How sorrow is being refined</page><page sequence="14">686 IN MEMORIAM away and transcended is revealed in the extraordinarily difficult section 116. Here, the persona asks if it is sorrow only that interacts with the sense of developing happiness (understanding, here, the seasonal images as correlatives of spirit): Is it, then regret for buried time That keenlier in sweet April wakes, And meets the year, and gives and takes The colours of the crescent prime? The reply is that "regret" (a milder term than the earlier expressions of extreme distress) is not all there is to it; that, in fact, regret is less vital than what the persona has done himself: Not all: the songs, the stirring air, The life re-orient out of dust, Cry through the sense to hearten trust In that which made the world so fair. It may appear here that he is being consoled by natural process, but the songs are his and the "life re-orient out of dust" is, from many vantages, the result of his own imaginative re-creation. The "that which made the world so fair" could be taken as a reference to a supernatural artificer, but is as readily taken to refer to the human constructor himself. The "stirring air" seems to refer to wind, but "air" suggests the "correspondent breeze" of Romantic thought and is, also, song. In Tennyson's intricately wrought style, the world "re- orient" suggests both reorientation and to be made pearl-like: life, like the poem itself, becomes a self-realized artifact of layered shells of time about a core of pain. But Hallam also becomes the center about which historical 'meaning" forms. The disasters are transfigured by his presence. In section 70, the persona hears a "wizard music roll,/ And through a lattice on the soul/ Looks thy fair face and makes it still." By section 127, the tone has become exalted: Hallam, "dear spirit, happy star,/ O'erlook'st the tumult from afar,/ And smilest, knowing all is well," because "Well roars the storm to those that hear/ A deeper voice across the storm." The sorrows of revolution and natural catastrophe are affirmed as the means by which spirit ascends from ruined chrysales, shattered stalks. These images suggest Carlyle's "clothes" philosophy of history, that movement occurs in a "Phoenix Death- Birth" when "fire-creation" destroys an "old sick Society . . . in the faith that she is a Phoenix; and that a heavenborn young one will rise</page><page sequence="15">HENRY KOZICKI 687 out of her ashes" (Sartor Resartus, 111.5). Also, the conviction that attends this system is sorrow: Teufelsdroeckh's Everlasting Yea is uttered in a "sanctuary of Sorrow," the "Divine Depth of Sorrow."25 Killham observes that Tennyson's readings during the period of In Memoriam's composition included several works on different theories of natural change. Both Christian orthodoxy about successive creations after cataclysms and Lyell's explanations for the development of species (that some were gradually eliminated by the violent struggle for existence after simultaneous creation) would together suggest to Tennyson the imagery of apocalyptic fire- creations involving redemptive suffering.26 Historical successions also bear this apocalyptic aspect, but the year-metaphor that the historian uses for such change, particularly as it is scattered through the works of the "Liberal Anglican" historians whose thought Tennyson found so compatible, is, again, not to be taken as mere natural process. Thomas Arnold's 1830 Thucydides, for instance, speaks of the autumn of the Greek city-states and the springtime of the Roman people, but the terms refer to conditions of moral being: i.e., a "will" to meaningful historical form.27 Sententiously put, man must suffer if he is to understand. He must contemplate the record of the suffering past until he arrives at its "meaning." The line that follows the persona's immobilization on the "great world's altar-stairs" -that he would "faintly trust the larger hope" -means, said Tennyson, "that the whole human race would through, perhaps, ages of suffering, be at length purified and saved" (Memoir, I, 321-322). The persona gathers time about him to enact this redemption in his role as "human race" and, indeed, as 25Sartor Resartus (11.9). Moore speaks of the fire and water imagery attenidinig Tennyson's "conversion," which he compares to Teufelsdroeckh's: (note 6 above), p. 158. Tennyson's celebrated phrase 'Passioni of the Past," in its use of "of" instead of "for" (as the phrase originally appears in a letter from Hallam to fennlysor), suggests redemptive historical suffering: Memoir, 1, 81, 253; II, 319. 26John Killham, Tennyson and "The Princess" (Lonidoni, 1958), pp. 246-250. Hough says that the "passage in the Epilogue about consciousness moving through 'life of lower phrase,' resulting in man, who himself leads to 'the crowning race,' refers not, as is commonly supposed, to the mutability of species, but to his other theory of successive separate creations": "Natural Theology" (note 6 above), p. 246. 27A. P. Stanley, for another (and later one of 'Tennyson's closest frienids), said in ani 1840 essay that the physical resemblance between the "body" of nation anid individual was "merely fanciful," and it was only "in regard to that moral being which alonte is essential to nations, or individuals, the analogy is complete."

Trhus redemption, even after it has been translocated to history and translated into the self-education of the general mind of mankind, continues to be represented in the central Christian trope of life as a pilgrimage and quest.28 In In Memoriam, the quest is inward as a drama of the mind, and the persona, like Red Cross Knight, is both the individual and the human race finding salvation in an apocalyptic continuum available for Everyman.29 Because "meaning" is this type of willed human construct, the imagery in the latter part of the poem reveals a significant change from the organic to that of the fabricated artifact. The persona perceives that past disaster is the furnace in which historical man is transfigured. Where earlier, "Time" had been an artless "maniac scattering dust [not yet "re-orient"],/ And Life, a Fury slinging flame" (50), with the realization that fire-births are redemptive the "flame" becomes purifying and transmuting. The Fury turns into a "giant labouring in his youth" with the agonies of the revolutionary forge: life is not as idle ore, But iron dug from central glooms, And heated hot with burning fears, And dipt in baths of hissing tears, And battered with the shocks of doom To shape and use. (118) 28Natural Supernaturalism (note 22 above), p. 191. 29J. C. C. Mays in "In Memoriam. An Aspect of Form," University of Toronto Quarterly, 35 (1965), 26, says "Tennyson solved the problem of form" in "the way closest to his own experience; he presents the drama of himself in the very process of discovering it, so that the continuity which underlies the whole poem's form is in the first place provided by himself in the role of hero." Tennyson offered that in In Memoriam "the different moods of sorrow as in a drama are dramnatically given"</page><page sequence="17">HENRY KOZICKI 689 With perfect form a construct, like the pearl of section 116, we are given the sundial and clock with "kiss of toothed wheels" of section 117, which the blacksmith might have made. But who is the blacksmith? The master craftsman is man himself: the anthropomor- phic projection, as God and Mind, of man's own nature as an Ultimate. The smithy is at once the worker, the object, and the forge, insofar as he shapes and hardens his own spirit on the anvil of the world, with the "shocks" of disaster, through his own suffering. "Out of darkness came the hands/ That reach through nature, moulding men" (124). Tennyson's impacted language makes several readings possible. The "hands" are usually taken to be the hands of God, but Tennyson said that God was apprehensible only through human attributes. The fact that they "reach through nature" suggests that nature is the press within which man is worked: it is a variant, then, on the "shocks" the anthropomorphic fabricator uses. Section 80 tells us that the persona senses the molding power of the past: "Unused example from the grave/ Reach out dead hands to comfort me." On this collective level, the hands are the memory of the examples of previous heroic creators: statesmen, poets, the "legisla- tors of mankind," in Shelley's phrase. Some of Tennyson's other poems indicate the context. In "Hail Briton!" for instance (and in the same stanzaic form), they wrought a work which time reverses, A precedent to all the lands, And an example reaching hands For ever into coming years. (11. 81-84) In "Tiresias," these creators are specifically those that dared For that sweet mother land which gave them birth Nobly to do, nobly to die.... . . . their examples reach a hand Far through all years. . . . (11. 118-123) This seems to imply the quality of Tennyson's first Eternal Truth, that God "revealed Himself through the human attribute of the (Memoir, I, 304). C. F. G. Masterman long ago made the point, in Tennyson As a Religious Teacher (London, 1910), p. 61, that Tennyson affirms the "certain reality of the self . . . the one and only thing of which by direct conviction we can assert reality. "</page><page sequence="18">690 IN MEMORIAM highest self-sacrificing love" (Memoir, I, 31 1). These hands, then, are the divine power of the formative past as the memory of sacrificial, heroic spirit: those who (we were told in section 56) "suffered countless ills,/ Who battled for the True, the Just." But the wine-press of the world is not so much manned by external forces (although they are there, as this formative memory along with, of course, all the potentials of the world) as willed into action by the apprehension of forces so available. Heroes may sacrifice themselves by design or chance (a free universe is by definition chanceful) and the "dark hand" that killed Hallam- "struck down through time,/ And cancelled nature's best" (72)-performed a deed indifferently providential and accidental, but it is clear that such heroic examples, providing the aspirant to "meaning" wills himself to close with the apocalyptic nature of redemption, become the dynamism of the human condition. Hallam is the agent of the disastrous power by which man evolves, at once both victim and God (like Christ), for the persona feels "the pressure of thine hand" (119) and "His being working in mine own" (85). The persona's creative will meets this divine past and gives and takes in interchangeable supremacy, not in redemptive determinism but in the freedom of the human will. The memory of Hallam-and examples like him-provides for the persona, both as individual and as the human race, the vantage he lacked in rectilinear, "end-determined" systems: A pillar steadfast in the storm, Should licensed boldness gather force, Becoming, when the time has birth, A lever to uplift the earth And roll it in another course, With thousand shocks that come and go, With agonies, with energies, With overthrowings, and with cries, And undulations to and fro. (113) Words like "pillar," "force," "lever," and "shocks" reveal that here, again, the imagery is not organic but mechanical, appropriate to the fabricated nature of the embraced "meaning" of revolutionary change. Individual, society, and the very earth are thrust into another orbit through the energy of explosion that marks the "ruined chrysalis" of dead forms of consciousness, and so "men may rise on stepping stones/ Of their dead selves to higher things" (1; a section written late). In Tennyson's style of multiple resonance, the "dead</page><page sequence="19">HENRY KOZICKI 691 selves" refers to the molt of individual and collective spirit as well as to the memory of heroes like Hallam. To apprehend the formative power of the past in this manner is to infuse the whole past with the historical imagination. From many vantages, In Memoriam is the "Way of the Historian," with "meaning" in the past a creative act: the past engaged with both passion and understanding in the classic problem of the historian who tries to write meaningful history. Section 128, in fact, can be seen as a list of the ways that historical time, the "mysteries of good,/ Wild Hours that fly with Hope and Fear," is to be interpreted. Their enumeration is a preparation for the celebrated conclusion of the section. The persona first wonders "If all your office had to do/ With old results that look like new," which appears to refer to the drawing up of the "lessons" of history: an antiquated Enlightenment approach. The employment of history tendentiously, for religious polemicism, seems the purport of these lines: If this were all your mission here, To draw, to sheathe a useless sword, To fool the crowd with glorious lies, To cleave a creed in sects and cries, To change the bearing of a word, To shift an arbitrary power. . Further, merely to study the past, joylessly, and not absorb its living power is "To cramp the student at his desk." Or, the past can be romanticized in the fashionable medievalism of the time: "To make old bareness picturesque/ And tuft with grass a feudal tower." "Why then," the persona says to Time, if these are the uses of the past, "my scorn might well descend/ On you and yours." But the culminating vision is that the historian must see as an artist: "I see in part/ That all, as in some piece of art,/ Is toil cooperant to an end."30 The "piece of art" is not history itself, but the perceiver's grasp of the "meaning" in it, through both passionate conviction and rational system: 3"Much commentary has gone into this "world as art" imagery. E. D. H. Johnson in "The Way of the Poet," Victorian Studies, 2 (1958), 148, rejects Bradley's quadripartite schema of spiritual progress and its corresponding psychological progression to offer a focus on Tennyson as craftsman; it is the "Way of the Poet" and a "poem of aesthetic quest." My cavil with this, of course, is that redemption lies not in the literary artifact, in a Palace of Art, but in history (into which, of course, the persona of this poem descends to "mourn").</page><page sequence="20">692 IN MEMORIAM The love that rose on stronger wings, Unpalsied when he met with Death, Is comrade of the lesser faith That sees the course of human things. Conviction may be more important than system-for "I have felt" (95), as the persona says-but both are necessary if the historian is to find the "meaning" of the past. To this historical art, Hallam can be seen as muse, attended by figures typologically significant. In section 37, the depressed persona is shamed by Urania for claiming only the "earthly" Melpomene and not aspiring to the higher, Miltonic inspiration. In section 58, Urania tells him to stay longer in the "cold crypts" where Hallam is buried, until he can take a "nobler leave" than merely a sad farewell, for (in a variant reading) a mere "speechless child can move the heart" -a qualification of the "I have felt" affirmation (of which critics have made too much)- "But thine, my friend, is nobler Art.' '31 As muse of "meaning" in section 103, Hallam is first merely a "statue veiled" but under the ministrations of both Urania and Clio- one would sing the death of war, And one would chant the history Of that great race, which is to be, And one the shaping of a star -he becomes a living presence on the "great ship" that moves on the deep of time. So inspired, the persona "felt the thews of Anakim,/ The pulses of a Titan's heart." This is no supernatural frame of reference, however, for Tennyson quite plainly said that these figures represented "human powers": "all the great hopes of science and men. "32 With "meaning" in the past a creative act out of human will and available in an apocalyptic present, this "great race, which is to be" that "one far-off divine event" of the Epilogue-can now fall logically into an "open-ended" frame. Section 118, which contains the master smithy, has the clearest statement of the "meaning" of the whole past. Seemingly, the frame of reference is "end-determined" and this is the way in which it is usually taken. "They say," the persona offers, 3'Ricks, p. 913. 32Knowles (note 2 above), p. 186.</page><page sequence="21">HENRY KOZICKI 693 The solid earth whereon we tread In tracts of fluent heat began, And grew to seeming-random forms, The seeming prey of cyclic storms, Till at the last arose the man; Who throve and branched from clime to clime, The herald of a higher race... But, says he further-leaving questionable this "evolutionary" process with the repeated "seeming" -man has the ever-present potential of realizing the higher state at any time: And of himself in higher place, If so he type this work of time Within himself, from more to more; Or, crowned with attributes of woe Like glories, move his course. ... It is a matter of the free, erected will facing the sorrowful past. The "one far-off divine event./ To which the whole creation moves" may appear to be an "end," but if man dwells in perpetual apocalypse this event is available in the here and now. This "event" is specifically described as "the crowning race/ Of those that, eye to eye, shall look/ On knowledge" -another qualifier on "I have felt" -"under whose command/ Is Earth and Earth's, and in their hand/ Is Nature like an open book." But Hallam had been such "a noble type/ Appearing ere the times were ripe." Critics have given up trying to explain Hallam in an "end-determined" scheme, except as he is this type of a superior consciousness.33 If Hallam was able to be, so may anyone in the eternal kairos realizable in the eternal now. The poem appropriately closes with the epithalamion and the inception of the child, a symbol of the fresh start struck into being 33Walker Gibson in "Behind the Veil," Victorian Studies, 2 (1958), 65-66, says that the message of section 118 is to "recapitulate Evolution within yourself and improve on it. . . . To move upward working out the beast is to become virtually immortal, like the speaker who watched the solid lands shape themselves and go. It is to be not a man, but Man." Eugene R. August in "Tennyson and Theilhard: The Faith of In Memoriam," PMLA, 84 (1969), 221, observed that Tennyson believed that "evolution has shifted from a biological natural selection to a spiritual growth which is partly man-controlled. In man, evolution has become conscious of itself. " My point is, in that his increasing consciousness-that of a collective Mind in history-wills the "meaning" of it all, spiritual growth is entirely man-controlled.</page><page sequence="22">694 IN MEMORIAM with "star and system rolling past." The foetus gathers together in its development the history of the whole past, but clearly goes to no "end" save as a flowering of the chrysalid form in the eternal present, free to fuse its own nature with such vestiges of the past. It is an "organic" symbol but, like the other organic imagery of the poem, should not suggest biological determinism nor any other linkage in an evolutionary scheme.34 Vicariously, the persona attains in the epithalamion a "holy marriage" (in Abrams' words once more) between the human condition and the cosmic nexus that may "create out of the world of all of us, in a quotidian and recurring miracle, a new world which is the equivalent of paradise."" Indiana University-Purdue University Fort Wayne, Indiana 34Rosenberg says that the "foetus, recapitulating the 'lower phases' of evolution, will develop, as had Hallam, into a closer link with the crowning race of perfected mankind, whose advent had been 'heralded' in Section CXVII": "Two Kingdoms" (note 5 above), p. 240; but he does not make clear how such recapitulation advances evolution, nor why this child should be a symbol for perfected mankind. August suggests that we see the poem's final idea as a "process of Christogenesis, that is, an attempt to give birth to Christ again by evolving AfterChrists-to borrow Hopkins' word": "Faith of In Memoriam," p. 224. This may or may not occur, of course; everything depends on the free human will. 35Natural Supernaturalism (note 22 above), p. 28.</page></plain_text>
