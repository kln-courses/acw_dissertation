This series, intended for the inter- mediate grades, is centered around the theme that man's unique body and mind is the explanation for his present position as master of the earth. At times the authors lose sight of their intended audience. In When Hun- ger Calls peristalsis is illustrated by reference to a drinking horse. The example is excellent, but how many children today watch horses drink? Later, in an effort to explain a catalyst, an example of the effect of a pretty girl on two uncommunicative boys is utilized. Few sixth grade boys enjoy the company of a pretty girl. The illustrations are generally good, though a diagram in Secrets of the Heart and Blood to show how food is absorbed into and distributed by the blood is unclear. In When Hunger Calls a map comparing present food re- sources (in calories) to the expected population of the year 2000 seems to have been added as an afterthought. In fact, few diagrams are actually inte- grated into the text, though they are at least spotted on the appropriate page. A more serious objection, however, is the occurrence of teleological state- ments. In Built to Survive we are told that the giraffe "has developed a ridic- ulously long neck so as to be able to feed on tree leaves." Another volume, Window of the World, indicates that "our hearing developed in order to be useful to us." Anthropomorphic state- ments are also present, though less common. The historical summaries are good and usually interesting, but the authors often fail to emphasize or adequately explore the important role of such processes as observation, measurement, and interpreting data. However, if one can ignore the many teleological state- ments, and if one is not too concerned about the nature of scientific enter- prise, the books may be acceptable. It seems, however, that they could have been much better. Rudy G. Koch Wisconsin State University Superior, Wisconsin 54880</page></plain_text>
