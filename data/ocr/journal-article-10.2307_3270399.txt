<plain_text><page sequence="1">NUMEN Vol. 40 (1993) THE STUDY OF RELIGION IN THE SOVIET UNION Survey article M.M. SHAKHNOVICH For the last seventy years, the study of religion in the USSR has gradually taken shape as the whole complex of the branches of science treating religious beliefs and worship. Studies attempting to apply the dialectical and materialist method prevail among studies devoted to these problems. A considerable amount of valuable studies has been published in the USSR in the fields of philosophy, sociology and psychology of religion, as well as in the field of the history of religions. Experts in religion are employed at the Studies of Religion Institute of the Academy of Social Science, at the Museum of the History of Religion, at the History Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, at N.N. Miklukho-Maklai Ethnography Institute, at the Philosophy and Oriental Studies institutes of the USSR Academy of Sciences, at Moscow and Leningrad/St. Petersburg universities, as well as in other research establishments. They attempt to grasp the general history of religion as an integral and consis- tent process, despite its enormous variety and contradictory nature, of the spiritual life of mankind as being determined in the long run by social and economic forces. This approach assumes the necessity to study each religion-its origins, development, and disappearance-on the basis of the specific, historical conditions which led to the rise of a religion and simultaneously with the study of the society in which that religion operated. The report by academician N.M. Nikolsky "Religion as a Subject for Scientific Studies" presented at the ceremonial meeting at Belorussian State University in Minsk on the 30th of October 1922 laid the foundation for the studies of religion in the USSR.' N.M. Nikolsky is one of the founders of the Soviet School of the study of religion, a prominent expert in various fields of the study of religion: in primitive beliefs, agricultural cults of the Ancient East, Judaism, early Christianity, and Russian Orthodoxy. In his report, he described the study of religion as a new, young branch of knowledge possessing a great future and to be used as an instrument</page><page sequence="2">68 Survey article in solving the most profound problems of the history of spiritual culture. Nikolai Mikhailovich Nikolsky argued that the situation and atmosphere free from attendant presumptions which are necessary for any other branch of science, are necessary for the continuous and correct growth of the study of religion as well. The history of religions student should possess not only formal but also the actual right to proceed with his studies absolutely freely, without any exaggerated caution or reservations, just as chemists, physicists, mathematicians, linguists, and ethnologists do.2 Unfortunately, one could not always fulfil these conditions. Vulgar sociological approaches which reigned in the social sciences made a great impact on the study of religion in the twenties, especially in the Origins of Religion by A.T. Lukachevsky, in the Oriental Ideologies by M.A. Reisner, and so on. Our criticism directed at the vulgar sociological approaches does not imply that we should completely deny the achievements of the Soviet philosophers and historians of the twenties and the thirties. In his book Introduction to the Theoretical Study of Religion (first published in 1973, second edition-in 1985), D.M. Ugrinovich described the results of the studies of the philosophical problems of religion (of the gnoseological analysis of religious consciousness, gnoseological roots of religion) carried out by Soviet scholars and the results of the sociological analysis of religion (the place religion occupies in society, its structures, its social function, and the role it plays in society, the relationship between the scientific and technological revolution and religion, the sociological analysis of religious feelings, religious groups and organizations, processes of secularization, etc).3 D.M. Ugrinovich defined the range of problems explored by the Soviet scholars in religious psychology: religious belief as a sociological and psy- chological phenomenon, characteristic features of religious feelings, social and psychological traits of a religious personality, the psychological impact of religious worship, and so on. Works by V.P. Bukin, A.I. Klibanov, M.G. Pismannik, M.A. Popova, K.K. Platonov, and V.K. Tancher are prominent in the field of the psychology of religion. Works by A.A. Portnov, an eminent psychiatrist, and the Psychoses and Religion (Leningrad, Medgiz publishers, 1967) by such an expert in the study of religion as M.I. Shakhnovich treat the problems related to psychoses and religion. In 1965, for the first time in Soviet study of religion, M.I. Shakhnovich raised the problem of nonconfessional forms of religion in his book A Scientific View of Contemporary Mysticism. Soviet scholars demonstrated in their works that religion in society</page><page sequence="3">Survey article 69 depends on the interests and goals of certain social groups and classes and is connected with their political and ideological struggles. However, religion possesses some independence in its development because the economic basis does not directly determine its changes. On the contrary, religion itself can exercise some influence on the economic basis. Interest in studies of religious beliefs in connection with the develop- ment of certain social conditions which gave birth to those beliefs is also reflected in the first Soviet scientific work on the study of religion: Religion and Society (Leningrad 1926), which had the subtitle Collection of Articles on the Exploration of the Social Foundations of Religious Phenomena in the Ancient World. It contains articles by the most prominent scholars and its importance persists up to the present day: V.V. Struve, "Social Problems in the Funeral Cult of Ancient Egypt" and "Dialogue of the Master and the Slave on the Meaning of Life According to the New Babylonian (Literary) Monument"; I.G. Frank-Kamenetsky, "The Prophet Jeremiah and the Struggle of Parties in Judea"; B.L. Bogaevsky, "Ritual Gesture and Ancient World Society"; B.L. Kazansky, "Everyday Basis of Sacrifice in Ancient Greece"; I.M. Trotsky (Tronsky), "The Religion of Greek Shepherds"; A.V. Boldyrev, "Religion of Seafarers in Ancient Greece"; and J.A. Borovsky, "Overcoming the Religious Element in the Laws of Ancient Greece". Soviet scholars have contributed to the study of religion in the whole world by their works on the origins of religion and on the early forms of religion. Works by L.J. Shternberg (Ethnographical Views of Primitive Religion), V.G. Bogoraz-Tan (The Chukchi Religion), G.P. Frantsov (Ancient Egyptian Religion), and D.K. Zelenin (Slavonic Beliefs) are among the best known. Academician G.P. Frantsov believed that religious manifestations such as fetishism, magic, animism, and totemism in those forms studied by ethnographers can be considered to be products of a long historical pro- cess. Therefore, none of these manifestations can be considered to be the original form of religion. However, in each of these manifestations one can see the primordial contents which can help the scholars to determine the nature of original religious beliefs. Frantsov maintained that one should look for the genesis of notions about the supernatural in the pro- cesses of the endowment of objects and natural phenomena with supersen- sible qualities. He presented a comprehensive analysis of the problem of the "sensible-supersensible" objects of worship in the ethnographic and archaeological evidence. He also revealed the nature of making fetishes of different objects and natural phenomena using, in particular, materials related to Ancient Egypt4 because he was an expert in the history of its spiritual culture.</page><page sequence="4">70 Survey article The eminent Soviet ethnographer, S.A. Tokarev, in his work Early Religious Forms and Their Development (Moscow 1964), summarized the results of studies on totemism, shamanism, ancestor worship, etc. and proposed an original solution for numerous complex problems in primitive religion. He also created his own theory of systems for early forms of worship. He believed that fetishism, magic, and animism were religious elements and that totemism, malignant magic, medical magic (sorcery), sexual magic, and funeral cults are the early forms of religion. In his opinion, more mature religious forms also develop within the com- munal and tribal system. They reflect the development of more complex forms of social life and material production: early tribal cults (initiation), hunting and fishing cults, family and tribal cults of sacred objects and patrons, patriarchal and family cults, secret society cults, tribal ancestor worship, shamanism, personal patron spirits cults, chieftain cults, cults of tribal gods, and agricultural cults. Considerable interest was also aroused by a paper written by S.A. Tokarev on the inner nature and origins of magic.5 Soviet ethnographers, archaeologists, philosophers,6 and historians have published more than 800 studies on early forms of religion. A lot of hitherto unknown materials on the religious beliefs and rites of numerous peoples of the USSR have been collected and analyzed.' Soviet experts in religion have especially excelled in their studies of shamanism.8 All these problems have been treated in numerous works by A.F. Anisimov who strove to solve them using materials on Evenk beliefs, especially in his work A Historical and Genetic View of the Evenk Religion and the Problem of the Origins of Primitive Religions (Moscow and Leningrad 1958). Books treating problems of primitive ways of thinking and of primitive consciousness have also acquired a considerable renown. These works include: Historical Roots of Fairy-Tales by V.J. Propp (Leningrad 1946); Tribal Systems and Primitive Mythology by A.M. Zolotarjov (Moscow 1904); Cosmological Notions of the Peoples of the North by A.F. Anisimov (Moscow- Leningrad 1959); Myth Poetics (Moscow 1976) and Palaeoasian Mythological Epic: The Raven Cycle (Moscow 1979) by E.M. Meletinsky; The World and Fairy- Tales ofAfrica by G.S. Kotljar (Moscow 1975); Myth by M.I. Steblin- Kamensky (Leningrad 1970); and The Logics of Myth by J.E. Golosovker (Moscow 1987). A number of works treat the process of change in myths in primitive society during the period of ancient civilisations: Myths of Ancient Egypt by M.E. Matje (Moscow 1956); Myths of Antiquity in Their Historical Development by A.F. Losev (Moscow 1957); and Archaic Myths of East and West by I.M. Djakonov (Moscow 1990). The problem of the rela-</page><page sequence="5">Survey article 71 tionship of primordial philosophy and religion also aroused considerable interest. M.I. Shakhnovich published two books on this subject: Primitive Mythology and Philosophy (Moscow-Leningrad 1971) and Origins of Philosophy and Atheism (Moscow-Leningrad 1973). The traditional approach to the studies of mythological semantics on the basis of the principles of struc- tural linguistics and semiotics goes back to the twenties and the thirties.9 The publication of the richly illustrated fundamental encyclopaedia in two volumes entitled Myths of the Peoples of the World marked a great event in the scientific and cultural life of this country (Moscow 1980, second edi- tion 1989). This work, which is the result of the collaboration of numerous prominent experts and was edited by S.A. Tokarev, contains articles about the mythologies of all the peoples of the world. It includes informa- tion about mythological characters and subjects, about different approaches to the studies of myths as well as summarizing articles about the underlying mythological motifs and images, and about myth types. Each article is followed by a bibliography and concise information about the elaboration of specific images in art. This publication is also of great interest because it reflects the whole spectrum of approaches which exist in Soviet studies of religion as several articles often simultaneously contain different opinions on the same problem. The USSR Academy of Sciences, Ethnography Institute, in the fifties and sixties published twelve volumes entitled Peoples of the World. Ethnographical Sketches, edited by S.P. Tolstov. This work contains in a generalized form an enormous amount of ethnographical evidence. It includes, in particular, materials about the religions of African peoples (edited by D.A. Olderogge and I.I. Potekhin, 1954), of the peoples of Australia and Oceania (edited by S.A. Tokarev and S.P. Tolstov, 1956), of American peoples (edited by A.V. Efimov and S.A. Tokarev, Part 1 and Part 2, 1959), of Siberian peoples (edited by M.G. Levin and L.P. Potapov, 1956), of the peoples of the European part of the USSR (edited by V.A. Aleksandrov and V.N. Belitser, 1964), of the peoples of Europe outside the USSR (edited by S.A. Tokarev and N.N. Cheboksarov, Part 1 and Part 2, 1964-1965), of the peoples of the Caucasus (edited by M.O. Kosven, Part 1 and Part 2, 1960-1962), of Eastern Asian peoples (edited by N.N. Cheboksarov), of Front Asian peoples (edited by N.A. Kisljakov and A.I. Pershits, 1957), of Middle Asian peoples and the peoples of Kazakhstan (edited by S.P. Tolstov, Part 1 and Part 2, 1962-1963), of the peoples of South-Eastern Asia (edited by A.A. Guber, 1966), and of South Asian peoples (edited by N.P. Guseva, 1963). In 1976, S.A. Tokarev published a special work devoted to the analysis of religious beliefs and rites of the peoples inhabiting practically every area</page><page sequence="6">72 Survey article of the world. It was republished several times and translated into numerous foreign languages (Religion in the History of the Peoples of the World, 1976). This book treats primitive national religions (religions of ancient civilizations included) as well as the world religions. Numerous groups of experts in ethnography, history, art criticism, and literary criticism have produced studies on the religions of China,'o Japan, 11 Australia and Oceania,'2 as well as traditional religions of dif- ferent countries of Europe,'3 Latin America,'4 and Africa.'5 Two volumes of Religious Beliefs of the Peoples of the USSR, written by a large group of Soviet ethnographers, were released in Moscow in 1931 (edited by V.K. Nikolsky). They laid the foundation for the profound study of traditional beliefs and worship in every area of this country, and their importance persists till this day thanks to the comprehensive nature of the subjects treated and to the depth of the ethnographical evidence analyzed. This publication includes articles on the religions of the peoples of the Caucasus, of the Volga region, of the Urals, of Siberian peoples, of the peoples of Middle Asia, of the European part of Russia, etc. These studies are carried on now by ethnographers in every republic as well as by experts in Moscow and Leningrad (the latter being the site of the State Museum of Ethnography of the Peoples of the USSR. Its staff carries out an enormous collecting work.)'6 Russian culture has deep-lying traditions in the studies of Slavonic mythology and folklore. The creation of a national school in Slavonic anti- quities is associated with such names as A.N. Afanasjev, A.A. Potebnja, and E.V. Anichkov. Their studies were carried on by D.K. Zelenin (East- Slavonic Ethnography, Moscow 1991-first published in German in Berlin in 1927 under the title Russische [Ostslavische] Volkskunde); by V.J. Propp (Russian Agricultural Festivals, Leningrad 1963); by S.A. Tokarev (Religious Beliefs of East-Slavonic Peoples in the 19th Century and Early 20th Century, Moscow-Leningrad 1957); by B.A. Rybakov (Paganism of the Ancient Russ, Moscow 1967 and Paganism of the Ancient Slavs, Moscow 1981); and by M.I. Shakhnovich (Rational and Prejudicial Omens, Leningrad 1984). Quite recently, the methods of structural anthropology and structural linguistics have become widespread and used in Slavonic ethnological studies (V.V. Ivanov, V.N. Toporov, Slavonic Modelling of Linguistic Semiotic Systems. Early Period, Moscow 1965 and Studies in Slavonic Antiquities, Moscow 1974; B.A. Uspensky, A Historical and Cultural View of St.Nicolas Worship in Russia. Features of Perception and Transformation of the Original Image [Papers on Sign Systems, Volume 10] Tartu 1978; Slavonic and Balkan Folklore. Reconstruction of Ancient Slavonic Spiritual Culture, Moscow 1983.) Profound studies of the Ancient Near East began in Russia late in the</page><page sequence="7">Survey article 73 19th century. B.A. Turajev17 and his pupils, A.I. Tjumenev, V.V. Struve, N.D. Flittner, N.M. Nikolsky, I.G. Frank-Kamenetsky, and V.K. Shilejko'8 made great contributions to the studies of Ancient Near Eastern cultures. The traditions of these scholars were carried on later in such works as The Overturn by Amen-Hotep the 4th (Moscow 1967, volumes 1, 2) by J.A. Perepjolkin; Ancient Egyptian Religion (Moscow 1976) by M.A. Korostovtsev; The Temple in Ancient Egypt (Moscow 1989) by H.A. Kink; Spiritual Culture of Babylonia (Moscow 1983) by I.S. Klochkov; Human Per- son in the Culture of Ancient Middle East (Moscow 1986) by I.P. Vainberg; and People of the City of Ur (Moscow 1986) by I.M. Djakonov. Multi-volume publications on the history of the Ancient World contain- ing articles on religious practices and mythology'9, as well as gorgeous albums with scientific notes on the art of the Ancient Near East20 are also of a great scientific value. Such prominent Russian historians of the late 19th century and the early 20th century as N.I. Novosadsky, J.A. Kulakovsky, F.F. Zelinsky, V.V. Latyshev, E.G. Kagarov, B.P. Bogajevsky devoted their efforts to the study of the antique religious world outlook. Their works served as textbooks for entire generations of Soviet students of antiquity. It is in the field of mythology that the most interesting books were published. These works include Greek Mythology (Moscow-Leningrad 1937) by M.S. Altman; Antique Mythology (Moscow-Leningrad 1939) by S.I. Radtsyg; Essays on Antique Symbols and Myths (Moscow 1930) by A.F. Losev, etc. The work by V.I. Ivanov, Dionysus and Pre-Dionysism was written in keeping with the traditions of the pre-revolutionary literature (Baku 1923). Textbooks and monographs of a general nature also contain articles on antique religion.21 Books on the culture of the peoples who used to inhabit the northern shores of the Black Sea22 as well as the works by E.M. Shtajerman on Ancient Rome also made a great contribution to the studies of antique religion.23 Soviet experts in Biblical matters used to assume that the history of Biblical texts is "one of the aspects of ancient Jewish history in which, as in the history of any nation, ideological development was determined by the process of the development of the real life of the nation ..."24 Such scholars as N.M. Nikolsky, A.B. Ranovich, I.G. Frank-Kemenetsky, M.I. Shakhnovich, I.D. Amusin, I.A. Kryvelev, M.I. Rizhsky, and others were active in this field.25 Studies on the religions of India are based on the works of experts such as I.L. Minaev, 0.0. Rosenberg, S.F. Oldenburg, and F.I. Shcherbat- skoy. Such books as The Religions of Ancient India (Moscow 1959) by G.F. Iljin; Jainism (Moscow 1968) and Hinduism. Development. History. Worship</page><page sequence="8">74 Survey article Practices (Moscow 1977) by N.R. Guseva; Ancient Indian Epics. Genesis and Typology (Moscow 1974) by N.P. Zhukovskaja; Buddhism (Moscow 1968) and Lamaism (Moscow 1973) by A.N. Kochetov; and The Civilization of Ancient India. Philosophy, Science, Religion (Moscow 1980) by G.M. Bongard-Levin were released during the Soviet period. The publication of the religious literary monuments of Ancient India is still going on. The Guide to Determination of North Buddhist Pieces of Iconography written by a group of Leningrad/St. Petersburg staff members at the Museum of History of Religion in 1987 aroused considerable interest among scholars. Soviet scholars have made great contributions to the study of Islam. It is sufficient to mention the works of V.V. Barthold, E.E. Bertels,26 I.J. Krachkovsky (who completely translated the Koran into Russian and wrote comprehensive academic notes to it), and V.A. Gordievsky. Impor- tant monographs were written by E.A. Beljaev, L.I. Klimovich, N.A. Smirnov, I.S. Braginsky, I.A. Petrushevsky, A.I. Ionova, M.V. Vagrabov, S.M. Gadzhier, M.B. Piotrovsky, and others. In their works, G.P. Snesarev, V.M. Basilov and others summarized the results of many years of research work related to pre-Muslim beliefs and cults which was carried out on the sites. Experts in Islam addressed the problem of this religion's origins, attempted to cast some light on the social basis of early Islamic ideology, anlyzed separate branches of Islam, the part Muslim organizations and movements used to play and still play in political life, as well as the con- temporary place of Islam in various Soviet republics.27 All these works laid the foundation which permitted the appearance of summarizing research works and books of reference on pre-Christian and world religions. In 1975-1976, I.A. Kryvelev published the two volumes of his History of Religion (its second revised edition was released in 1988) which treats predominantly the history of the world religions. This work consistently describes the origins and development of Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. This description follows the sections treating the origins of religion on the whole as well as some problems related to the history of the early religions of the Mediterranean which can help to better understand the historical roots of the cults and tenets of the world religions. Wide circles of experts28 who perpetuated the traditions of the mythological and comparative historical approach to the studies of Chris- tianity chose as subjects for their research the genesis of Christian literature, the origins and evolution of Christian worship, the develop- ment of the Church, as well as other problems related to early Christian history. They analyzed social and economic prerequisites for Christianity</page><page sequence="9">Survey article 75 during Antiquity and the social part it played, identified periods in its history, and studied early heresies. Studies of sources, the publication of sources, and the search for dating the New Testament monuments have assumed a prominent position among the interests of this group of historians of religion. The following books treating these problems are of a special interest: The Origins of Christian Literature (Moscow-Leningrad 1946) and Rome and Early Christianity (Moscow 1954) by R.J. Vipper; On Early Christianity (Moscow 1959) by A.B. Ranovich; Comparison of the Gospels (Moscow 1967) and Origins of Christianity (Moscow 1960) by J.A. Lentsman; Historical Evidence About Jesus Christ (Moscow 1969) by I.A. Kryvelev; and Secret Writings of the First Christians (Moscow 1969) and Early Christianity. Some Historical Facts (Moscow 1987) by I.S. Svenitskaya. Soviet scholars have paid great attention to the study of Roman Catholicism and papacy. The book by S.G. Lozinsky Papacy History (Moscow 1934, 1961, 1986) used to be the most fundamental work on the history of Roman Catholicism. It consistently treats the history of papacy up to the end of the 18th century. His efforts were picked up among others by M.M. Sheinman (Contemporary Clericalism, Moscow 1964). The best- known books on the history and the present state of Western Christianity were written by M.B. Andreev, V.I. Garadzha, M.P. Mchedlov, N.A. Kovalsky, L.I. Velikovich, V.J. Njunka, J.V. Minkjavichjus, R.T. Rashkova, N.V. Revunenkova, and others. The problem of the attitude of the papacy towards Russia in the 9th and 15th centuries is explored in the book Papacy and Russia (Leningrad 1961) by B.J. Ramm. I.R. Grigulevich has published numerous important works on the history of the Inquisition, on contemporary Vatican activities, as well as some papers analyzing the position and role of the Catholic Church in Latin America. 29 The problems of reformational movements and the origins of Protestant churches have not been left unnoticed by Soviet historians.30 Numerous Soviet historians have also explored the past of the Russian Orthodox Church. The Russian Church History by N.M. Nikolsky (1st edi- tion in 1930, 3rd edition in 1983) and the essays The Church in Russian History From the 9th Century Till 1917 (Moscow 1967) written by the members of the USSR Academy of Sciences, Institute of History staff are among the most outstanding works of the kind. Works by B.D. Grekov, M.N. Tikhomirov, B.A. Rybakov, A.M. Samsonov, B.P. Kandidov, I.U. Budovnits, N.A. Kazakova, A.M. Sakharov, G.F. Grekolov, J.N. Shchapov, N.S. Gordienko, M.P. Novikov and others treat various aspects of the history of Russian Orthodoxy. Many interesting articles</page><page sequence="10">76 Survey article and books were published in 1988-1989 on the occasion of the 1000th anniversary of the christening of Russia.31 A.I. Klibanov has made a great contribution to the exploration of religious and social movements in Russia. He published a series of fun- damental works, which can be actually seen as one enormous work in five volumes, on the history of religious sectarianism and Russian popular freethinking in the 14th-20th centuries: The Reformation Movement in Russia From the 14th Century Till the First Half of the 16th Century (Moscow 1960), A History of Religious Sectarianism in Russia (Moscow 1965), Religious Sec- tarianism and the Present Day (Moscow 1970), Popular Social Utopia in Russia. Feudalism Period (Moscow 1977), and Popular Social Utopia in Russia. The 19th Century (Moscow 1978). For this series Klibanov was awarded the USSR State Prize in 1980. L.I. Emeljakh published a few books devoted to the problem of peasant movements and the Church in Russia early in the 20th century (Anticlerical Peasant Movements During the First Russian Revolution, Moscow-Leningrad 1965; Peasants and the Church on the Eve of the October-Revolution, Leningrad 1976, and others). There are academic periodicals in the Soviet Union which contain articles and reports related to study of religion. Examples are such periodicals of the USSR Academy of Sciences as Philosophy Problems, Soviet Ethnography, Bulletin of Ancient History, etc. The USSR Academy of Sciences, Institute of Scientific Information in the Field of Social Studies publishes a special bibliographical index (issued 6 times a year) entitled New Soviet and Foreign Literature. Problems of Atheism and Religion. Various research institutions have their own regular periodicals which treat subjects related to the study of religion. Problems of Scientific Atheism is the best known periodical of this kind (1966-1989, Nos 1-39). It used to be published by the Institute of Scientific Atheism of the CPSU Central Committee Academy of Social Science. This periodical used to contain among others articles on the history of religion and the church both in the USSR and abroad and on the sociological and psychological aspects of religion. Such periodicals as the Problems of Religion and Atheism History (1950-1964, Nos 1-12) published by the USSR Academy of Sciences and the Year Book (1957-1963, Nos 1-8) published by the Museum of the History of Religion in Leningrad/St. Petersburg are basic works by groups of authors which contain great amounts of information and elaborate research papers on various aspects of theoretical and applied study of religion. At the moment, the Museum of the History of Religion publishes 3-4 times a year collections of academic studies devoted to particular subjects,</page><page sequence="11">Survey article 77 such as Topical Problems in the Study of Religion and Atheism (1976), Art and Religion (1979), Islam and the Present Day (1985), Orthodoxy in Ancient Russia (1989), Problems in the Study and Criticism of Oriental Religions (1979), Primitive Society and Religion in the Light of Contemporary Evidence (1984), Rus- sian Orthodoxy and Atheism in Russian History (1988), a series of publications treating the problems of social and philosophical as well as social and psychological analyses of religion and religious morals. Collections of works on specific subjects put out by the Peter the Great Anthropology and Ethnography Museum in Leningrad, which were pub- lished already before 1917 (43 volumes have been issued since then), are also of substantial interest. They contain materials on the cultures and religions of the peoples of the whole world. The "Nauka" publishers and their Oriental Literature Editing Department annually publish the Religions of the World. History and the Present Day collection. Studies of religion in the Soviet Union have moved a long way in over- coming vulgar sociological and other interpretations. On the basis of the best traditions of progressive Russian philosophical thought and advanced historical science, Soviet scholars have achieved a lot in their exploration of the complex problems of such an important area of spiritual culture as religion. The discussion about the study of religion in the magazine Soviet Ethnography,3 which involved many philosophers, historians, and ethnographers, has helped to set further goals for the study of religion. Scientific exploration of the problems related to the studies of religion in the light of the new way of thinking, which is being developed in this country during the present period of restructuring every aspect of our spiritual life, necessitates a critical revision of the old-fashioned concepts and a further development of the valuable and advanced heritage accumulated by Soviet scholars.
