Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994. 452 pp. Elliot Wolfson is arguably the country's premier scholar of Jewish mysticism. Through a Speculum That Shines (henceforth Speculum) represents his most important and provocative work to date. It is a very informative, thought-provoking, and audacious book that warrants serious consideration. The density of this panoramic presentation, combining a plethora of primary sources from biblical to medieval writings and beyond, with pointed critical analysis and wide-ranging methodological discussions, makes fór challenging reading. This is compounded by the copious footnotes, which constitute perhaps a third of the text. Although formida- ble, Speculum is richly rewarding. Wolfson lays out a multi-faceted thesis at the outset and explores these core issues throughout the book. His starting point is the contention that despite biblical Judaism's advocacy of aniconism, which absolutely rejects any imaging of God (as in Exodus 20:4), graphic visionary experiences abound. These frequently assumed anthropomorphic form. This position in itself is easily substantiated. Wolfson, however, frames this discussion in gender terms. He contends that Jewish mysticism was an androcentric enterprise, undertaken by men who were imaging a male Deity. Their focus was the Divine phallus. "[CJommon to the visionary accounts in the different mystical sources I examined in this work- the writings of the Hekhalot mystics, German Pietists, and theosophic kabbalists- is the notion that the object of the mystical vision is the male deity and, more specifically, the phallus. The speculated figure that</page><page sequence="2">124 SHOFAR Winter 1996 Vol. 14, No. 2 provides the foundational condition for the visionary experience is the disclosure of the phallus" (p. 395). A more graphic contention follows: "It is obvious from these settings as well that the ejaculated phallus is the object of vision" (p. 396). Wolfson's phallocentric interpretation of Jewish mysticism entails three additional sub-themes. Fundamental to visionary experience is the role of the eye. He contends that ocularcentrism is itself phallic depen- dent- "Not only the object seen, however, but the eye itself corresponds (or substitutes for) the penis" (p. 5). Secondly, the feminine aspect of the Godhead is likewise phallocized. " [The Sbekinab ] is ontologically localized in the male organ . . . the bride enters the nuptial chamber and is transformed therein into the crown of the bridegroom. This transformation represents the final restoration of the female to the male, for the bride has become the corona of the penis" (p. 275, n. 14). Finally, he suggests that this preoccupation with penises is indicative of homoeroticism: "The question of homoeroticism is central to understanding the phenomenolog- ical structure underlying the mystical vision of God in the kabbalistic sources" (p. 396). This phallocentric thesis is undeniably the most original and radical aspect of the book. Its audacity will probably attract the most attention and commentary, which is understandable but rather unfortunate. It is the weakest element of an otherwise solid and enriching presentation. In fact, it is only integral to the final two chapters of the book and hence need not overly distract the reader. The book is divided into seven chapters. Wolfson systematically analyzes material in chronological order. Chapter One is devoted to a study of visionary experience in biblical, apocalyptic, and rabbinic literature. Beginning with Friedrich Heiler's classic study Prayer (1932), it has become normative to differentiate prophecy from mysticism. Wolfson, however, effectively advances the reintegration of biblical narrative and prophetic experience into the domain of mysticism. He also underscores the importance of Hosea 12:11: "I have multiplied visions and in the hands of the prophets I was imaged." "The exegetical recasting of this verse, particularly the second clause, indicates the central role accorded the imagination in the mystical consciousness within historical Judaism" (p. 70). In connection with the visionary experiences of ancient Israelites, Wolfson cites a midrashic comment pertaining to Aaron's sons, Nadab and Abihu, who acted improperly: "R. Tanhuma said: This teaches that they loosened [the covering of] their heads, their hearts became haughty, and their eyes feasted upon the Presence" Çya-Yikra Rabbah 20:10). This</page><page sequence="3">Kabbalah Refracted: Review Essay 125 passage provides Wolfson with his first opportunity to propose a phallo- centric interpretation. He begins his analysis as follows: "It is likely that in this context the head or face functions as a displacement for the phallus and the uncovering of the head symbolizes the disclosure of the male organ, perhaps in a ejaculatory state. The sexual promiscuity or brazenness of the sons of Aaron (signified by the loosening of the head cover) that led to their sexual arousal (implied by the act of feasting their eyes upon the Presence) is contrasted with the modesty of Moses, who hid his face when he encountered the Presence- that is, sublimated his sexual arousal vis-à- vis the divine" (p. 43). This analysis is highly improbable. It ignores the fact that the initial act of the priests, shepaťu et rasbeihen , i.e., they bared their heads, refers to a biblical injunction directed at the priests not to engage in public mourning activities; see Lev. 10:6. Moreover, Wolfson's scenario does not conform to the sequence in the Midrash in that Wolfson is suggesting that the brothers ejaculated prior to seeing the Sbekbinab. Half a dozen similar examples of a phallocentric interpretation are scattered throughout Chapters 1 through 6. All are suspect and problemat- ic. Thus, he cites a Hekhalot text that describes the mystic's act of vision: "his eyeballs are seized by pulsations, and his eyeballs emit and send forth flames of fire" (p. 92). Wolfson comments: "I would suggest that the eyes function in this context as phallic symbols and that the danger of beholding the garment is related to the taboo of seeing the divine phallus. The phallic symbolism of the eye also underlies the description of the ocular gyrations and fiery discharges from the eye of one who does gaze upon the cloak of glory" (p. 93). It is noteworthy that this text is referring to the mystic's eyes. Like the preceding example from the Midrash, Wolfson tries to substantiate his theory of the Divine phallus based on anatomical descriptions of the visionaries themselves and not God. This is unconvincing. Additionally, he interprets discharges of light from the eye as a phallic symbol. This ignores the commonly held theory espoused by Plato and others that vision was predicated upon the eye emitting visual fire (see Timaeus 45b-d). One must also wonder exactly what Wolfson is proposing. For example, he cites a Hekhalot text that describes the visionary as one who is worthy to enter the inner chamber and "behold the King in his beauty ( be-yofiyo )." He comments: "If my reading is correct, then in this context the word yofi is interpreted more specifically as a reference to the membrum virile " (p. 85, no. 50). Is he suggesting that these ancient texts were actually referring to the Divine phallus, but doing so cyrptically and euphemistically? Or, was this process only happening on the subconscious</page><page sequence="4">126 SHOFAR Winter 1996 Vol. 14, No. 2 level of the texts' authors? To be sure, Wolfson's comments are replete with Freudian terminology- displacement, sublimation, taboo, "the correlation of Eros and Thanatos" (p. 335); nevertheless, he never discusses Freud directly. At several points he does acknowledge his indebtedness to "the French feminist philosopher and psychoanalyst Luce Irigaray, who has emphasized the link between ocularcentrism and phallocentrism in Western culture" (p. 5, n. 7); see p. 274, n. 13. Amazingly, Wolfson does not seem to perceive his project as essentially freudian and psychoanalytic, rather, he construes it as a feminist enter- prise! "Does . . . gazing at the chariot or . . . contemplation of the glory entail, as modern feminist theory would express it, a phallic gaze, the eye substituting for the penis and the object of vision signifying the external- ized, representable form of the phallus?" (p. 104). The first half of Chapter Two offers an important methodological discussion on the phenomenology of mystical experience, in which he proposes a modified contextualist (i.e., Katzian) position. Although he readily agrees with Steven Katz that "a mystic's particular religion shapes his or her experience at the phenomenal level" (p. 54), Wolfson con- cludes: "This does not, however, logically preclude the possibility of underlying patterns of experience or deep structures that may be illuminated through a comparative study of various mystical traditions" (p. 55). In so doing, Wolfson seeks common ground between Eliade and Scholem. At the conclusion of Chapter Two, Wolfson discusses the seminal text, SeferYezirah. He is especially interested in its anthropomorphic depictions of ten sefirot and formulates a radical thesis that even in Sefer Yezirah the ten sefirot are theosophical rather than cosmological and thereby refer to the Divinity- they are "ontic realities that constitute the divine realm" (p. 72). Such an approach is totally dependent upon isolating the opening passages of this text from the cosmological explanation of the sefirot that immediately follows. He offers no real support for eviscerating the text in this manner, other than referring in passing to the opening as a "redac- tional stratum" (p. 71). This is problematic in light of the presence of the cosmological explanation in all recensions of the text. Chapter Four, entitled "Theories of the Glory and Visionary Experi- ence in Pre-Kabbalistic Sources," is especially rich and rewarding. Wolfson starts by offering an insightful fourfold typology of interpretations of prophetic visions found in pre-kabbalistic literature: allegorical, psychologi- cal, realist, and emanationist. He then proceeds to systematically study and situate eight major early medieval Jewish thinkers including Saadia, Shabbetai Donnolo, Abraham ibn Ezra, and Judah Halevi. In particular, his</page><page sequence="5">Kabbalah Refracted: Review Essay 127 extended discussion of Donnolo is a finely nuanced and informative discussion of this underinvestigated figure. One of Wolfson's many strengths is quite evident in his treatment of the basidei 'asbkenaz in Chapter Five, namely his extensive utilization of unpublished manuscript texts. In this chapter he cites numerous manu- script and adroitly demonstrates how the basidei 'asbkenaz used and adapted a variety of perspectives that were formulated by their predeces- sors and which had been skillfully analyzed in the previous chapter. Wolfson's primary focus is R. Eleazar of Worms, whose copious writings reveal both an exoteric and esoteric perspective on visionary experience. He ends, however, by asserting: "It can safely be concluded, therefore, that the experiential component is central and not tangential to the Pietistic theology" (p. 268). While this may be true, Wolfson did not provide sub- stantiation for this claim. All of the discussions of Divine visions that he cited were theoretical and none were overtly experiential. The most interesting aspect of Chapter Six on the period of early kabbalah is Wolfson's challenge to Scholem's conceptualization of the kabbalistic enterprise: "Scholem asserts that the contemplation of the sefirot has nothing to do with visions but is solely a matter of intellectual ascent" (p. 279). Wolfson on the other hand advocates the primacy of vision and experience over intellect and theory, by asserting that the kabbalists were operating in "the world of the imagination" (p. 280). Throughout this chapter he tries overly hard to associate "imagination" with the Divine phallus. Towards the end of the chapter he asserts: "There are kabbalistic sources that explicitly connect the phallic aspect of the divine and the production of images" (p. 316). As evidence he cites two phrases that appear in two texts from the Circle of Contemplation. Not only is this evidence meager at best, but all it does is establish that these writers associated imagination with the ninth Sefirab , to which they ascribed multiple connotations. The text, Sod 'Eser Sefirot , is presented as follows: "In the delineation of the ten gradations, the ninth, which corresponds to Yesod or the divine phallus, is described as 'the king in the power of imagination'" (p. 316). Note that it is Wolfson and not the kabbalist who interjects the phallic reference. Another example of eisegesis is Wolfson's discussion of Sefer Ha- Yibud. In this text, worthy mystics are accorded a vision of the Divine Countenance. They are depicted as being guests at the Divine wedding celebration: "They enter the chamber of the king and 'eat of its luscious fruit' (Cant. 4:16), and they delight in the entertainment of the bridegroom and bride." The thrust of Wolfson's analysis of this material is the following: "In the final analysis, the object of the mystic's gaze is the divine</page><page sequence="6">128 SHOFAR Winter 1996 Vol. 14, No. 2 phallus. . . . This is the implication of the mystic's taking delight in the joyful play of the bridegroom and bride. The intensely erotic element of the mystical vision ... is the divine phallus disclosed in the moment of coitus" (p. 286). Herein Wolfson explicitly interprets the expression "entertainment (i mazmute ) of the bridegroom and bride" as sexual intercourse (see also p. 286, n. 55). Mazmute , however, does not refer to the sexual activities of the wedding couple, but rather to the music played at the wedding feast (see M. Jastrow, Dictionary , 755 and 402). According- ly, this text does not depict a vision of Divine intimacy and union, but a public event- the food and music of the wedding festivities. Wolfson introduced this passage by framing it as the primary illustration of a truly audacious contention: "Moreover, the ocularcentric orientation of theosophic kabbalists is related to a phallocentrism that informs every aspect of their religious thinking and practice" (p. 285). This hypothesis is not supported in either this particular instance or the concluding chapter on zoharic literature. Whereas in the prior chapters Wolfson offered expansive discussions of visionary experience and only occasionally focused on phallocentrism, the final chapter of the book is devoted entirely to a multi-faceted exploration of this latter theme. This is truly regrettable, as it eliminates much of importance that pertains to the general topic of visionary experience in the Zohar. For example, it is undeniable that sections of the Zohar , especially Idra Rabba and Sifra di- Zeniutay contain some of the most graphic depictions of the Divine Face found in all of Jewish mystical literature. Wolfson ignores all of this material, presumably because it is not inherently phallocentric. Similarly, in a discussion of mystical praxis he contends that there are "two such procedures mentioned in the Zohar to induce visionary experiences" (p. 380). This generalization does not take into account the candle-gazing technique that is described in great detail in Zohar I:50b-51b, which engenders a non-phallic visualization of the Godhead. One of the most challenging sections is headed "Crowning and Visionary Union with the Phallus" (pp. 357-368). It focuses on the feminine aspect of the Godhead, namely the Shekhinah , which the kabbalists associated with the tenth Sefirah , Malkhut. Wolfson concentrates on a secondary designation for this Divine potency, Atarah , crown. He asserts: "The symbolic correlation of the corona of the penis and the feminine Shekhinah is facilitated by the philological coincidence that the word Atarah , 'crown, 'is the technical name of that part of the male anatomy as well as one of the designations of the Shekhinah " (p. 358). Wolfson then cites a passage by R. Isaac of Acre. It is one of the most graphic selections in the entire book and one of the few that ostensibly</page><page sequence="7">Kabbalah Refracted: Review Essay 129 supports his phallocentric thesis. "[The word] qesbet (bow) [refers to] Atarab according to the form, for if you contemplate the arc of the penis ( gesbet ba-gid) you will see the form of the waw&gt; and the corona is in the form of a yod" (p. 359). This text explicitly recommends that if one wants to understand the relationship between Yesod and Malkbut , one could consider human anatomy. It does not, however, suggest that the Godhead possesses a penis- instead it specifies that the iconic counterpart to the human penis within the Divine milieu is the letter vav from the Tetragram- maton. It should be emphasized that R. Isaac discussed the term Atarab under the rubric of Malkbut, sovereignty, and that here and elsewhere the primary connotation of Atarab is a regal crown. In fact this is the sole significance of this word in Tanakh- only in rabbinic literature did it acquire a secondary, anatomical connotation. Accordingly, whenever the term Atarab appears one cannot disregard its primary connotation, unless the context indicates otherwise. As is evidenced by the series of texts that follow, Wolfson, however, blithely assumes that references to Atarab can be interpreted as referring to the penile corona. Moreover, he extends this hypothesis to other terms for crown, such as tzitz (p. 360f) and kelil (p. 284, n.50). This is highly suspect. It lacks linguistic support, as these other terms are never used in conjunction with the penis, and is entirely dependent upon psychoanalytic presuppositions. Throughout the book Wolfson passionately advocates a phallocentric goal of visionary experience, without effective substantiation. Of the hundreds of texts that he presents, not one explicitly corroborates his claim that the mystical goal was to see the Divine phallus! Rather, his entire discussion is based upon questionable interpretations. Nor does he ever explain what the mystics hoped to gain from witnessing a cosmic sex show featuring the disclosed Divine phallus. Instead, what many of these sources do provide is abundant evidence that from Moses onwards the visionary goal within all stages of the Jewish mystical tradition was to perceive the Divine Face, be it manifest as a female or male countenance. Complementing this visual experience there was frequently an auditory component in which the word of God was conveyed. This linguistic apprehension of the Divine Mind and Will could also be achieved through the mystical study of the Torah, as Wolfson demon- strates in the concluding sections of Chapter Seven, "Textual Study, Mystical Enlightenment, and Prophetic Revelation" (pp. 377-380) and "Hermeneutics as a Visionary Mode" (pp. 383-392). A superb formulation of the Zohar* s mystical enterprise is the following: "it can be shown that the main vehicle for achieving revelatory experience of a primarily visual</page><page sequence="8">130 SHOFAR Winter 1996 Vol. 14, No. 2 sort is hermeneutics, the mystical interpretation of Torah, which is the corporeal form of God" (p. 383). It should be emphasized, however, that most of this mystical interpretation of the Torah is aurally framed, through discourses, dialogues, and discussions by the protagonists of the zoharic narratives. Wolfson's conclusion is therefore an oversimplification: "In sum, then, mystical gnosis for the Zohar is primarily visual and not auditory" (p. 390). Although visions of the Divine Face/Countenance are evidenced in dozens of citations in the book, it cannot be traced in the Index, which does, however, have extensive listings of similar terms, such as "eyes," or " heart. " More problematic is the lack of an index of citations from classical literature: biblical, rabbinic, or zoharic. By far the most egregious deficiency of the Index is total absence of reference to the numerous secondary authors who are discussed in the copious footnotes. Insofar as the footnotes constitute a major part of the book and it is usually in them that Wolfson engages in his most pointed and informative methodological discussions of secondary sources, his vast erudition is rendered virtually inaccessible by this omission. For example, his crucial references to the psychoanalyst Irigaray are found exclusively in footnotes, and therefore this name does not appear in the Index. It should also be pointed out that Wolfson's debt to Irigaray goes beyond methodology. The monograph's title, Through a Speculum That Shines , is a double entendre. On the one hand it evokes the talmudic assertion that Moses alone of all the prophets saw God "through a speculum that shines" (B. Yevamot 49b) (p. 26), as well as echoing the title of Irigaray' s Speculum of the Other Woman. In all, Speculum is a challenging and informative book that warrants scholarly attention. In spite of its serious flaws (perhaps because of them), it is very stimulating reading. Wolfson cautions, "one must be careful to avoid the lure of psychoanalytic reductionism if one is to grasp the phenomenology of religious experience in general and mysticism in particular" (p. 188). Hopefully, this gifted scholar will heed his own warning in future studies.</page></plain_text>
