<plain_text><page sequence="1">PSYCHOLOGY A DOMAIN OF ITS OWN. WITH REFERENCE TO THE BIOCHEMICAL INTERPRETATION OF MENTAL PHENOMENA. PSYCHICAL activity so obviously constitutes a class of its own that it has been regarded as radically differ ent from any other natural phenomenon. Here lies the basis of all dualism, and here if anywhere must be sought its justification, which however is only relative. A close study of the situation leads to a monistic conception, but while monism removes the contradictions of dualism, it can not and should not slur over the contrasts of nature which actually exist. Psychical phenomena are different from any other kind of natural happenings and it would be vain to deny it. Nevertheless there have always been advocates of a one sided monism who claim that psychical activity can be and has to be explained from physical, or chemical, or perhaps biochemical facts ; that therefore psychology should be re garded as a branch of physics and that from physics or chemistry we shall have to expect the solution of psychical problems. This view is quite common among a great number of naturalists and we deem it proper in the interest of our readers to have it presented in our columns by Mr. Robertson of the University of California, who in his line has done good work, but while the results of his labors may prove valuable in biochemistry we do not expect that they will contribute anything toward the solution of psy chical problems.</page><page sequence="2">388 THE MONIST. It is perhaps natural that men of Mr. Robertson's type would look upon my views as inconsistent and think that theirs alone are truly scientific and monistic. On a super ficial inspection my proposition appears dualistic, so I will here set forth my reason why I deem the naturalistic mo nism (as it might fitly be called) insufficient and untenable. Not without satisfaction I note that among scientists, thoroughly familiar with chemistry and physics, Rignano makes a praiseworthy exception in that he most vigorously insists on psychology being sui generis and as different from physics as e. g. electricity is different from chemistry. We go further still and say that psychology being the sci ence of the phenomena of the domain of subjectivity, has a character of its own different from all the sciences of objective phenomena, mechanics, physics, chemistry and physiology. This of course does not exclude that occa sionally and in very important details these sciences will throw light on the mechanism or objective conditions of feeling and thinking, but they will never explain the prop erly psychical or subjective phenomena of the soul. In cidentally we will add that if Mr. Rignano had been fa miliar with the philosophy of form or the philosophy of science, as our view of monism may be fitly called, he would have been helped in working out his own theory and might have both deepened and broadened it. We can not satisfactorily explain our objections to Pro fessor Robertson's position without going over the whole field of psychological problems, but on account of their paramount importance we gladly take this opportunity to recapitulate our views in a concise form. THE IMPORTANCE OF PSYCHOLOGY. The laws of nature are the same for the whole realm of existence, yet we must recognize that there are differ ences of conditions, and we can classify different kinds of</page><page sequence="3">PSYCHOLOGY A DOMAIN OF ITS OWN. 389 phenomena according to their characteristic features into distinct groups. One of the most obvious divisions is the distinction between organized and unorganized nature, the latter consisting of the purely physical domains of existence and the former comprising all the phenomena of life, vegetal and animal, reaching its climax in the de velopment of humanity. If the whole of existence is one, we can not look upon the development of life, of animation, of consciousness and of rationality as some accidental by-play, but on the con trary we must regard soul, spirit, mind, or whatever you may call it, as the necessary outcome of the intrinsic na ture of existence. Nevertheless organized life constitutes a domain of its own and within this domain the group of psychical phenomena is again a province with distinct char acteristics which are absent in the domain of inorganic nature. The attempts to explain psychology from physics or chemistry must therefore be futile, for the very elements of psychic life (the significance of subjective states) are not met with in those fields where the objective conditions alone (which are always matter in motion) are an object of investigation, viz., in molar mechanics, physics, chem istry and electricity. A view of the world based alone upon physics and chem istry or in general upon the science of objective nature will always prove a failure, for it will never explain the soul. Thus we must invert the process and expect a solu tion of the world problem not from the lowest forms of existence but from its highest efflorescence. We must rec ognize the import of subjectivity which though apparently absent in pure physics, reveals itself in the consciousness of man, the noblest product of organized life. If we want to understand the mechanism of objective nature in its complications, in its growth, in its wonderful</page><page sequence="4">390 THE MONIST. details, we must start with the simplest phenomena; but if we would like to know the meaning of the whole, the direction in which nature tends and the aim which by an intrinsic necessity it pursues, we must consider the highest phases of its evolution, for thus alone can we realize the potentialities that lie latent in the cosmic conditions. Here lies the paramount significance of psychology, and we do not hesitate to say that the way in which the psychological problem is treated in a philosophy is always the best test of its worth. THE DOCTRINE OF PARALLELISM. The doctrine of parallelism has been generally accepted in psychology, but it must not be interpreted in a dualistic sense. There are not two separate factors, the psycho logical and the physiological, running parallel to each other, but there is one reality which has two aspects,?the one being the internal or subjective, the other, the external or objective. The two are as inseparable and yet different, as the internal and the external curves of a circle. The character of the subjective domain exhibits the phenomena of sentiency, feeling, awareness, consciousness and self-consciousness in different degrees, beginning with the absolute zero of feeling and rising up to the concen trated attention of a rational being. The character of the objective domain is motion, gravity and momentum; chem ical reaction, heat, electricity, vitalism, physiological func tions and the action of premeditated purpose. The inner aspect of subjectivity always corresponds to the outer as pect of objective events. Both form a unit, and are mu tually determined, or properly speaking, they are the same in two aspects. It is a parallelism of aspects, but not a parallelism of two independent realities. I know that feeling is a reality, for I am feeling. I myself, as I am known to me, consist of feelings and so we</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGY A DOMAIN OF ITS OWN. 39I may say that feelings are the surest and most indubitable reality. Motion on the other hand is the object of my ob servation. I take note of changes that are taking place; they are modifications of my own being, the causes of which mostly do not originate in me, but are thrust on me and constitute otherness, or something thrown up against me?such is the literal and original meaning of the Latin word objictum derived from objicere. Hence their whole domain is called objectivity. Our own body is part of the outer objectivity and only our feelings are subjective, yet these feelings animate the body and suggest at once that body and feelings belong to each other as outside and inside of the same thing. The contrast between subjective and objective phe nomena becomes most apparent in the fact that we can feel our own feelings, not those of others. We can see the motions that, judging from our own condition, we assume to accompany other creatures' feelings, but their feelings themselves can never become objects of observation or in spection. As feelings they are and remain forever sub jective. The two aspects are radically different, for feeling is not motion, nor is motion feeling. The soul is not body, and the body is not soul, but they are one, of which the soul is the inner, and the body, the outer aspect. * * * Such is the doctrine of parallelism in its monistic inter pretation, which, however, leaves the question of the nature and origin of consciousness open, and here I offer an ex planation which, briefly stated, is this: Every objectivity has its subjective aspect, and is possessed of the potentiality of developing into actual feeling; but the subjective in terior of purely physical phenomena cannot be ensouled with anything like actual feeling or awareness or conscious</page><page sequence="6">392 THE MONIST. ness, because its inner commotions or subjective states re main isolated. Isolated feelings are not feelings in the proper sense of the word. In order to be actually felt, they must internally enter into a relation so that one feeling meets another feeling; two or several feelings must co operate, so as to let one feeling feel the other. One feels while the other is being felt, thus producing the possibility of an interaction between several subjective states among themselves. Thereby alone can the feeling of a contrast originate, and only through the feeling of contrasts can a state of awareness result, yet any such internal interaction of feeling is possible only through organization. This explanation tallies with facts established both by biology and by physiology, for we know that consciousness is always associated with a nervous system originating in these organisms which are moving about. Stationary or ganisms have to wait for the satisfaction of their needs, but a motor-endowed creature is enabled to go in search for food. In this way its organs learn to co-operate, and this imposes upon them unity of purpose. The unity of purpose produces the unity of the soul. The characteristic distinction of living beings, when compared to physical phenomena devoid of life, is organi zation in so far as it renders possible a co-ordination of subjective states. Vitality is not a special force or sub stance ; it is solely the function of organization, but as such it is a phenomenon sui generis and different from the forces of physics, chemistry, electricity or molar mechanics. MEMORY THE PRESERVATION OF LIVING FORMS. The typical feature of organization is the constant change of material which takes place in living substance. It is called metabolism, and in animal substance consists of a building up or anabolism, and a partial breakdown of the energy thus stored up, called catabolism. Anabolism</page><page sequence="7">PSYCHOLOGY A DOMAIN OF ITS OWN. 393 is nutrition ; it changes food into living substance, a process called assimilation. Catabolism in setting energy free renders motion possible and this motion has under certain conditions its subjective aspect, which means that it is ac companied with feeling. The partial breakdown of living structures called cata bolism is not always the same but varies in form, depend ing upon the circumstances under which it takes place. It is a reaction upon a stimulus, and the reaction upon ether waves or light, air waves or sound, upon a touch of chem icals (as in taste or smell), or upon mechanical impacts are different physiologically as well as psychically. In other words: The irritation of light will produce one kind of structural change, while the irritations of sound and of touch cause other modifications, all of them being anal ogous; the same kind of cause corresponds to the same kind of physiological function, and each function possesses a form of its own and is accompanied by a feeling peculiar to itself. Here the great significance of form for the explanation of life and of the soul becomes manifest. The psyche with its mentality, its reason, its purposes, its ideas, etc., would not be possible, if organization did not involve a preser vation of form. The waste material of a catabolic breakdown (mostly carbonic acid) is discarded, while through the anabolic process of nutrition the lost elements are again restored in the living substance, and this is done in such a way as to preserve the structure in its minutest detail. Thus the modifications produced by the reaction upon the several stimuli remain and constitute so-called vestiges or traces. In so far as this preservation of the form of living sub stance is accompanied by feeling, and as former feelings can be revived on the application of proper stimuli, it is called memory.</page><page sequence="8">394 THE MONIST. Memory, as Hering has pointed out, is a property com mon to all living substance; it is the indispensable condi tion of the development of the soul. The differentiation of nerve activity into the senses with its several modes of reacting upon the stimuli of the outer world, is due to a specialization of the several reactions in different spots, and this specialization becomes permanent through mem ory, which means through a preservation of the forms of the several reactions. For a comprehension of psychology, viz., for our knowl edge of subjective phenomena, it is quite indifferent what biochemical processes are its physical accompaniments; whether it is acid as Professor Robertson tells us which serves as a kind of axle-grease for the wheels of memory, or a salt or any other chemical. If we knew the whole chemistry of the brain it would throw no light on the slightest psychic action or mental process. Bio-chemistry can only solve the problems of the bio-chemical conditions of the brain and has nothing whatever to do with the mind as such. This statement does not involve a dualistic inter pretation of mental phenomena but only demands the dis tinction between the spheres of subjectivity and objectivity which, though two aspects of one and the same reality, are after all radically different in their nature. All events, states, and facts in this world are inter related or correlated and all of them form one inseparable universe. But for that reason science distinguishes be tween different aspects, different features, and different qualities, aftd focuses its attention on one in order to com prehend those features which at the time are to be in vestigated. We have to obey this rule also in psychol ogy, and thus the attempt to explain psychical phenomena from the physical facts would be about the same as to ex pect a demonstration of the Pythagorean theorem from ex periments in chemical affinities. The attempt at solving</page><page sequence="9">PSYCHOLOGY A DOMAIN OF ITS OWN. 395 psychological problems from biochemistry would be about on the same level as if an art critic insisted that in order to explain the composition and meaning of Raphael's Sis tine Madonna he would have to make a chemical analysis of the paints and the canvas Raphael used. The spirit of a book is not in the paper or printer's ink, and the soul of a man is not his body nor his cerebrum. The soul of a man is the meaning which his sentiments possess and the pur poses which he pursues in life. It is true that the investigation of the biochemical con ditions of the brain will prove of great interest and will help us to better understand the nervous mechanism, but the nature of mental processes and their problem will re main the same as before. Physicists are frequently in the habit of condemning even legitimate psychical investigation as metaphysical, and there are not a few who would regard psychology as only a branch of physiology. With reference to their claims we will say that they are frequently unfair to psy chologists and misrepresent their views. For instance Professor Robertson speaks of the old metaphysical view as "the dualism which regards the mind as a species of gaseous vertebrate dwelling within, but not, or only in a minor degree, subject to the physical and chemical laws which govern our material body." Even Thomas Aquinas would have demurred to this representation of his conception of the soul, and we would remind Mr. Robertson of the fact that the expression "gas eous vertebrate" has never been used seriously by any one who holds the dualistic soul-conception, and is merely a joke which Haeckel once made when referring to the anthropomorphic God-conception. An expression which is made as a jest can certainly not be used to describe the characteristic feature of a view to be combated. Professor Robertson refers to the remarkable fact that</page><page sequence="10">396 THE MONIST. the results obtained by Weber and Ebbinghaus, with the exception of a few immediate applications, have done little to extend our knowledge of the field of mental phenomena and he believes, following Loeb, that "valuable clues are afforded by the tropisms" and further "that clues of equal value are afforded by the phenomena of memory/' As to the significance of memory we agree, but Profes sor Robertson instead of explaining memory (as we do) as a preservation of form, regards the processes of memory as physical and chemical phenomena, and compares the reaction of memory to catalysors which act in such a way as to make the reaction quicker by repetition, and this is done through the formation of acids. He says : "Here we have, also, the obvious suggestion of a working hypothesis of memory; during the perusal, for example, of a printed word, acid is produced in some portion of the cerebral tissue, hence the word is more readily repeated until, after a certain number of repetitions, we can dispense with the external stimulus of the printed word and repeat the pro cess of cognition spontaneously." Professor Robertson's reduction of this statement, to a mathematical formula, log n = Kr-\-b, where is the number of syllables memorized, r the number of repetitions, and and b constants, may be very imposing to the gen eral reader but adds nothing to the explanation of the phe nomenon itself. In spite of the merits of Professor Loeb especially in the line of physiological experiments, in which specialty he has distinguished himself, we can not see that psychology would be helped by calling some definite reactions which take place under some definite conditions "tropisms." We do not gain a scientific comprehension of these transactions until we gain an insight into the mechanism which upon a definite irritation causes organized life to move in a special direc tion and in a special way. New names do not explain,</page><page sequence="11">PSYCHOLOGY A DOMAIN OF ITS OWN. 397 however learned they may sound and we are little helped if memory is henceforth "scientifically and more appro priately" termed "associative hysteresis." The reason why psychological laboratories have added so little to our psy chological knowledge is in my opinion the wrong notion upon which the experiments are based, that the soul can be measured quantitatively, and though measurements are quite helpful in many respects they will never throw light on the soul itself whose very character is of a qualitative nature. I know very well that the idea is quite common among certain naturalists that the notion of quality is not to be tolerated in science and that every problem is ulti mately of a quantitative nature, but we demur and have set forth our reason in a special article, entitled "The Sig nificance of Quality," which has been published in The Monist, Vol. XV, p. 375. MEMORY THE SOUL BUILDER. The most important service of memory is the part it plays in building up the soul. Memory creates the con dition which begets the soul and then continues its further growth by adding and superadding new mental riches to its capacity. First of all memory renders possible comparisons be tween the traces of past impressions and new sensations. Every memory image possesses a form of its own, and a sense-impression of the same kind travels on the path of its forerunner and revives its analogous memory trace which results in a feeling of sameness. The new sensation fits into the trace of the old one and is felt to be of the same kind. This feeling of sameness implies an act of recogni tion whereby the sense-impression gains meaning; and thus sense-impressions of the same kind come to represent the objects which cause them. Here we have the principle from which we derive the</page><page sequence="12">398 the monist. explanation of the soul, for the soul consists of feelings which have become representative of things, conditions, experiences, etc. In order to solve the problem of the origin of the soul we must show how sentiency acquires significance. Certain feelings come to stand for certain objects. They represent them. The living ideas of a man are sentiments freighted with meaning and the soul is a system of sentient symbols. This solution looks very simple and it is simple indeed ; but how grand and infinitely complicated are the corollaries implied. Consider that a symbol, or a representative mean ing, is what it is by its relation to an objective reality, which may be a concrete object, a condition or a general feature of many objects, or a universal truth. There are false symbols and there are true symbols, and these sym bols are not merely pictures of actualities, but also of aims, of aspirations, of ends to be attained. They have a prag matic tendency. They possess moral or religious values, and these values may be true or false. They may lead in the right or in the wrong direction ; they may be in agree ment with the constitution of the All or they may be, as it were, out of tune. They may be more or less an incarna tion of the world-order which sways not only stars and motes but also guides the thoughts and sentiments of man ; and here we have a test of progress. Progress is not (as Spencer has it) "a passage from the homogeneous to a heterogeneous state," but the realization of truth. Progress means growth of soul, and growth of soul means growth of truth. The more clearly, correctly and completely truth is mirrored in a man, the higher he ranges in the scale of evolution. Editor.</page></plain_text>
