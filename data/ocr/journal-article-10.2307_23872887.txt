<plain_text><page sequence="1">3 - MONKEYING AROUND WITH INTERACTION ANALYSIS: THE APPLICATION OF INTERACTION ANALYSIS SYSTEMS TO PRIMATE SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR by Larry Fedigan Department of Curriculum and Instruction The University of Calgary Calgary, Alberta, Canada We were driving back to Austin after a hot, frustrating day of trying to devise a way of recording, in a systematic manner, the social behaviour of a group of gelada baboons (Theropithecus gelada) on an island in the San Anto nio Zoo, when the idea first insinuated itself. "Why don't we use the Flanders'?" I exclaimed, sitting up and accelera ting at least 10 mph. "Use the what?" replied my wife, Linda, clutching the dashboard and look" ing at me in some alarm. Linda is a primatologist, and whilst the problem of the underachieving ape had led us to some lively discussions, she wasn't "into" interaction anal ysis. However, like every good doctoral student in Education, I was, and suddenly the obvious parallels between the direct, authoritarian teacher and a harem-male baboon were drawn. By the time I had explained the Flanders System of Interaction Analysis, (Flanders, N.A., and Amidon, E.J., 1967) the car had slowed down to a reason able cruising speed and my wife's questions were aimed at probing rather that humoring me. Already some problems had been raised, the Flanders' seemed fine for re cording discrete categories of behaviour of a repetitive nature, but did not seem so appropriate for the very important yet often momentary gestures which, in the baboon troop, signalled the onset of a sequence of hostile or friendly social interactions. To record and quantify these gestures was important since the hypothesis Linda was working on stated a relationship between the frequency and type o√≠ gesture and the position and role of the animal in the baboon troop. Once again, interaction analysis came to the rescue. The Observatior Schedule and Record (Medley, D.M. and Mitzel, H.E., 1958), commonly known as the OScAR, provided a matrix upon which the frequency and direction of speci fic interactions could be recorded. Also it allowed whole sequences of inter actions to be recorded in their progression. Linda was convinced, I was enthused and Dr. 0. L. Davis Jr., under whost guidance I had learnt to use the OScAR, was intrigued: the universality oJ interaction analysis was established and a new era in interdisciplinary re search proclaimed!</page><page sequence="2">4 - In fact it was fairly easy. After a few trial runs and modifications the Flanders' Baboon Interaction Analysis System, which became called the Activity Record, functioned perfectly; even to the extent of having exactly ten categories. i/d ratios were not calculated although the questions of whether some dominant males are more direct than others and how the degree of directness affects the learning and socialisation of the rest of the group obviously merit consideration. The ten categories derived for studying the gelada baboons are described below. The fact that Unelassifiable Activity is designated as Category 1 (cf Confusion, Category 10, Flanders Interaction Analysis System) should be consid ered as an arbitrary rather than an anthropomorphic decision. Category 1 Unclassifiable Activity. Category 2 Movement of the animal from one place to another. Category 3 Inactivity. (Sleeping, sitting or lying immobile.) Category 4 Self Activities (such as self grooming or masturbation.) Category 5 Grooming of another gelada. (The gelada baboons share the island with a herd of Aodad sheep, which they some times groom.) Category 6 Being groomed by another gelada. Category 7 Eating. Category 8 Interaction with males other than grooming. Category 9 Interaction with females other than grooming. Category 10 Interaction with juveniles other than grooming. The categories were chosen after many hours of observation. Support for their exhaustive and exclusive nature came from the small number of Category 1 tallies recorded and from the ease of categorization which resulted in very high inter-recorder agreement. A procedure similar to that used in recording classroom interaction was employed. However the interval was increased from three to five seconds. That is, every five seconds a tally was made of the category corresponding to the activity the observed animal was engaged in. Over a twenty-minute record ing period, 240 tallies were made. Seldom would an animal change activities during a five second period, and when it did the activity of longer duration within the five second period was recorded. The kinds of questions which generated the data collected with the Ac tivity Schedule sought to establish and differentiate a variety of male roles thought to exist within the gelada baboon social organization. Starting with the elemental question of what does a gelada do all day, and making an exis tential assumption that a baboon is what he does, the hypothesis soon emerged that if the postulated male roles existed then they would be evidenced by the</page><page sequence="3">- 5 - differences in activities recorded. However, to investigate fully such questions, a record of social inter actions, as well as continuing activities, was needed. The former consist of a number of gestures and actions, which have been described by researchers and upon whose characteristics and signification there is general agreement. In the case of the gelada baboons, the following signals or gestures generally are recognized as characterising the range of social interaction occurring in a typical herd. The exact meaning depends on context. 1) Lid (LD) - the geladas have a pink expanse of skin on their eye lids which they may literally "flash" at another animal by drawing their brows back. This is a threat gesture and may be used by males and females. 2) Lip roll (LR) - a more intensive threat gesture than the lid, as it usually occurs after it when the tense situation continues to build. This gesture is made by rolling the lips back from the teeth exposing the gums and the teeth. Both males and females do this. 3) Chase (Ch) - just what it says. This seems to be the most hostile interaction and causes the most excitment on the island. Occasion ally males chase females, but the chases are more frequently be tween males, and often males join in who had not originally been in volved. Males occasionally slap at each other during these chases and a male may bite or snap at another, although this usually oc curs too rapidly to be substantiated. 4) Displace (Dis) - not always an obvious gesture, one gelada walks toward another who immediately moves out of the former's way. Fre quently the displacer will sit down or stand in the exact location the displaced has just vacated. This is considered to be the dis placer showing his dominance over the displaced. 5) Yawn (Yn) - a particular type of yawn given only by the subadult and adult males which exposes their teeth (especially canines) fully. Males appear to yawn like this in times of anxiety or when they feel under tension, but it is always difficult to determine if the yawn is directed at another animal in particular. 6) Lip smack (Ls) - smacking the lips together rapidly. This gesture appears to be a sign of non-aggression used in social situations in which there might be some tension between the animals. Its most fre quent use is by a male preceeding a sexual interaction. A recurring pattern of interaction is: the harem male lip smacks at a female, she sex presents, he inspects and/or mounts, and she grooms him. 7) Sex present (SP) - a female (and occasionally male) gesture of ori enting the anal region toward another gelada's face while raising the tail and sometimes glancing back over the shoulder. 8) Inspect (Insp) - a possible reaction to a sex present which consists of looking very closely at the anal region presented and/or putting</page><page sequence="4">- 6 - the mouth to it and/or touching it with the hand. 9) Mount CMt) - one gelada stands up against the back of another (males brace their feet on female's hind legs) and perform mock or real coitus. This interaction is most frequently male to females, but is also possible between two males, two juveniles, or two females. 10) Groom (Gr) - one gelada inspects and cleans the fur of another. Used by and between males and females; this appears to be a group of reinforcing interaction. 11) Play (Py) - two or more animals wrestle with each other, usually accompa nied by a play face which consists of drawing the lips back and mock-bit ing or mouthing the other animal. This has only been seen among juvenile and subadult males. Since the sequence of events and the who did what to whom dimensions of interaction are of great importance, an interaction grid on which such things could be recorded directly was required. The OScAR provided just such a grid. (See Table 1.) In its original form, the 18 categories of the OScAR form the vertical axis of the grid; tallies are made horizontally so that the sequence of verbal behaviours may be followed. Since the interactions are considered to be dya dic, that is all of the students are considered as one, the identity of the interactors easily is discerned in reading a tally sheet. With baboons, the latter is not so. If the animal being watched usually could be compared to the teacher being observed, the members of the herd with whom it interacted certainly could not be considered as one. They can, however, be subgrouped, and the division into male, female, and juvenile groups was found to be ade quate. Interactions were considered to fall in two main classes, hostile or sup portive, and four hostile behaviour categories and 6 supportive behaviour cate gories were defined. Any one of these ten behaviours could occur between the animal observed and a male, female or juvenile in the herd, giving thirty pos sible interactions. To facilitate the recording of the interactions, which had to be done in situ, of course, vertical categories were separated into hostile and friendly behaviours, each group of behaviours being repeated three times, corresponding to the three possible classes of interactees. The problem of how to indicate the initiators of the interaction was re solved by using different tally marks. When the interaction was initiated by the animal being observed, a tally was made thus, \. A diagonal in the oppo site direction, /, was used to indicate an interaction in which the observed animal was the recipient. A tally sheet with a sequence of interactions recorded is shown in Table 2. Again, the schedule proved easy to use and a very high observed reliability rate was obtained.

This and other similarly constructed hypotheses were tested using chi-square tests. The interaction schedule proved simple to use in the field. Interactions were recorded in 20 minute sessions, spread throughout the day. It was estimated that for every twenty minutes of data collecting, one hour is spent in the field. Some 500 minutes of interaction data and 500 minutes of activity data were collected, representing approxi mately 50 hours of field work. In summary, two interaction analysis systems were adapted and used to re cord the activities and interactions of a herd of gelada baboons in captive yet natural, social groups. The schedules proved highly successful in terms of their ease of use and appropriateness. The use of observational instruments for the systematic recording of so cial behaviour only recently has become widespread in ethological studies and the schedules still are few and simple compared to the variety available tore searchers in the behavioural sciences (Simon, A., and Boyer, E.G., 1970). Of course borrowing methods and tools from another discipline is fraught with po tential disaster. However, the metaphors of primate behaviour studies are so very different from those of education and psychology that the danger should be minimal. Anyway the current Zeitgeist of statistical measurement seems unbea table, so the obvious thing to do is to join. A summary of the main findings follows, taken from a recent article In Be haviour (Fedigan, L., 1972), where the exquisite details are to be found. Two principal questions were posed: (1) Is a specific male role signifi cantly related to the amount of time an animal engages in each activity? and (2) Is a specific male role significantly related to the types and amount of interaction the animal has with other geladas? In both cases chi-square tests were significant and allowed the conclusion that a male gelada*s role indeed is significantly related to his activities and interactions. Further massaging of the data was done by comparing qualitative and quan titative observations; the results also are to be found in the summary that follows.

(90.4% interaction with juveniles, 14.6% time spent interaction with males.) 3) more friendly than hostile inter- Supported. (63% friendly interac actions with juveniles. tions, 7.4% hostile interactions.) In all, of twenty hypotheses advanced, 17 were statistically supported, three were uncertain and 2 were not statistically supported, thus the instru ments largely seem to have been suitable to the task. However, the hypotheses for which the data were described as uncertain do indicate one limitation that should be kept in mind when hypotheses are drawn up. The activity record (adapted from the Flanders), records % time spent in various activities, whereas the Interaction schedule (adapted from the OScAR), analyses the direction and time of interactions, but not their duration. Recognizing the differences between the two instruments, it becomes pos sible to offer an explanation of the contradictory or uncertain data. For ex ample, in testing the hypothesis that a bachelor subadult male would spend more time in interactions with males than juveniles, data taken from the Activ ity Record showed that 8.6% of that bachelor subadult's time was spent in in teractions with males and 2.3% of his time in interactions with juveniles. How ever, data from the Interaction Schedule indicated that 53% of the interac tions recorded were with juveniles, while 41% were with males. The apparent contradiction disappears when it is realized that not all interactions last the same length of time and that one instrument is recording the duration of inter actions . In the case quoted, the key probably is grooming, which tends to be an activity of fairly long duration. A bachelor subadult male spends a good ammmt of time grooming adult males, yet has many short interactions of a play type with juveniles, hence may spend a large proportion of his total time in activ ities with males, yet a larger number of his total interactions with juve niles . So, the transplant seems to have been a success and the thriving patient confidently is facing sterner challenges. Armed with schedules and stop watches we are off to study the social behavior of 150 Japanese Macaques roam ing over 200 acres of cacti, mesquite, and rattlesnakes in Southern Texas.
