Courtship and Continued Progress: Julian Huxley's Studies on Bird Behavior MARY M. BARTLEY Department of Molecular Biology Vanderbilt University Nashville, Tennessee 32235 If there is one theme that unites the writings of Julian Huxley it is his com- mitment to the idea of human progress. Perhaps as a result of growing up in the shadow of his famous grandfather T. H. Huxley, or of discussing ideas about the future of the world with his novelist-brother Aldous, Julian always seemed to be drawn to "the big picture": where did humans fit into the greater scheme of existence? In this paper, I will attempt to examine Julian Huxley's commitment to human progress by exploring an early period of his life in which he was actively engaged in scientific research. I have chosen to concentrate on this period because it serves to illustrate the ways in which he manipulated his scientific findings in order to promote his social and political agenda. The present paper is an attempt to look carefully at this younger Julian Huxley, during a period in which he studied the social behavior of birds, and to examine the extent to which he incorporated human progress into his scientific practice. Since bird courtship was his first scientific enterprise, evidence supporting the belief that his worldview shaped his empirical work on birds would indicate that his belief in human progress was present from the beginning of his career and therefore influenced the construction of his later scientific endeavors. I suggest that Huxley's work on birds was largely constructed around the social and political goals he held for humans; bird courtship behavior provided him with a case study to promote his agenda on human progress. Furthermore, I argue that he created his own version of sexual selection theory as a powerful mechanism to promote human improvement. "Courtship" and The Great Crested Grebe On the surface, Huxley's first scientific enterprise began as little more than a holiday to watch birds. However, as Richard Burkhardt points out, Huxley</page><page sequence="2">92 MARY M. BARTLEY was one of a group of British and European bird enthusiasts in the first two decades of this century who were beginning to turn away from merely adding rare birds to their life-lists and turning instead toward in-depth studies of the life histories of common birds.' Huxley was anxious to become a "great-deal seer" in the footsteps of his famous grandfather, and after returning from a disappointing stint at the Naples Biological Station he was eager to begin a study that might have brighter prospects.2 In the spring of 1912, he set up his observational equipment at the Tring reservoir in Hertfordshire in order to watch the courtship behavior of the great crested grebe. He spent two weeks with his brother Trevenen pursuing "scientific bird-watching" on this aquatic bird. Like most of the birds Huxley studied for the next ten years, the grebes did not show great sexual dimorphism. Furthermore, he noted that the sexual displays were not performed just by the males for the benefit of the females, they were mutual - the males and the females seemed to participate equally in the courtship displays. He was deeply impressed by the complexity of the courtship rituals performed by these birds, as well as by the harmonious relations between the sexes. Juliette Huxley, Julian's wife, maintained that during their honeymoon in 1919, Julian was more interested in the love- making of grebes than in the practical study of human love-making.3 Huxley was not the first to find grebes interesting: dedicated amateur birders such as Edmund Selous and W. P. Pycraft had written articles on the courtship behavior of the great crested grebe beginning ten years prior to Huxley's first grebe observation.4 Burkhardt points out that Huxley may have owed more to amateurs than he was willing to admit in print.5 In several instances, it appears that he reinterpreted his own observations to coincide with some of Selous's observations. Selous, in particular, was a strong proponent of Darwin's sexual selection theory at a time when the theory had many critics; Huxley's discussion of sexual selection at the end of his paper on the great l Richard W.

In his 1914 paper "The Courtship-habits of the Great Crested Grebe," Huxley describes the curious and elaborate "dances" that the birds perform for each other: the "headshaking ceremony" in which the birds face each other and wag their similarly ruffled heads, and the "penguin dance" in which both male and female rise from the water and touch breasts and occasionally present a piece of weed to the other sex. While he first suggested that the grebes' mating behavior could be explained by sexual selection,9 he later believed that something unique was operating in these and other birds with little sexual dimorphism. He stated that by the time he wrote about the great crested grebe, "I had already satisfied myself that, in spite of all the scornful criticisms of the laboratory zoologists, there must be something in Darwin's Theory of sexual selection: nature does not produce elaborate plumage in a male bird for nothing, nor develop elaborate actions nicely calculated to show it off to best advantage, unless there is real biological advantage involved."'10 He wrote that Darwin had only considered elaborate plumage and displays in the male, but that he himself "was on to something new and exciting in zoology - the fact of nuptial adornments common to both sexes and displayed 6Julian Huxley, "The Courtship-habits of the Great Crested Grebe (Podiceps cristatus); with an Addition to the Theory of Sexual Selection," Proc.

BARTLEY in mutual ceremonies."' 1 Huxley coined the term "mutual sexual selection," or "mutual selection," which he described as a blend between sexual and natural selection. The structures and actions arising under it have their immediate origin in the preferences of individual birds, not in anything outside the species, and in their immediate function they are entirely confined to the courtship. On the other hand, the mutual courtship itself, the activities of both birds taken together, may be of use to the species as a whole, in keeping the sexes together when necessary.'2 He proposed that when the birds found mates early in the season and "a vari- ation in the direction of bright colour or strange structure occurred, it would make the actions more exciting and enjoyable, and those birds which showed the new variation best would pair up first and peg out their 'territories' for nesting before the others could get mates." 13 Through this process of mutual selection there had been a reciprocal transference of pairing instincts, and the result was a species that had elaborate displays but was not dimorphic. Huxley emphasized that the grebes had undergone a process of "sex-equalization": "This process consists in a gradual transference of all secondary sexual char- acters of the male to the female, and vice versa."14 In the courtship paper, Huxley separated the actual act of coition, which takes place early in the season, from the elaborate displays that continue even weeks after coition even weeks after coition has taken place. He suggested that these elaborate ceremonies were expressions of emotions built up inside the grebes and then let loose until "self-exhaustion" occurred. He proposed a phylogenetic scenario by which coition throughout the season was replaced by coition limited to the early part of the season. But during the rest of the season the mating pair continued to perform the courtship "dances" since, he believed, they were mutually pleasurable and acted to keep the mating pair together. The actions became symbols of willingness to pair, and since they were "associated with pleasurable and exciting emotions, they could become the channels through which these emotions can express themselves, and so change from purposeful stimuli to further action into merely pleasurable self- exhausting processes."'I5 This pleasurable "self-exhaustion" resulted from the release of excess emotional energy during the mating season: "When normally executed, the action is accompanied by violent and pleasurable emotion which usually dies down, or changes, into a quite different feeling, one of satisfac- X Ibid., p. 2. 12 Huxley, "Courtship-habits" (above, n. 6), p. 524. 3lIbid. 14 Ibid., p. 505.

Its recollection then acts as a partial stimulus, so that next time it is a little more easily performed."''6 Huxley wrote that when birds are in a period of sexual excitement, The excitement is not always completely exhausted by the act [of pairing], and, if so, the act is repeated (just as the shaking-bouts of the grebes are continued for a longer or shorter time, according to the degree of. what we may call courtship excitement). But supposing that general sexual excitement arouses both the male and the female emotional states, then the performance of the act once in the male attitude will only exhaust the feeling of 'male excitement,' leaving the 'female feeling' still a-tingle. This result will be, first, an inducement to repeat the act and, secondly, an inducement to repeat it with attitudes reversed.17 Thus to Huxley, the self-exhaustion was a mutually fulfilling experience for the grebes. Since coition had already taken place early in the season, symbolic coition in the form of elaborate displays were performed until the "dancers" purged their systems of excess emotion. These displays could recur, however, whenever the birds were sufficiently excited. Huxley viewed this recurrence as vital to the bonding that he believed took place between the sexes. He emphasized that the grebes shared equally in almost every part of the breeding season - males and females built nests, incubated the eggs, and tended to the nestlings. He pointed to their monogamy as a kind of "marriage" that is advantageous to the species.'8 Durant writes that "anthropomorphism set the tone of Huxley's observa- tional accounts, generated many of his explanatory hypotheses, and underlay virtually all of his extrapolations from human to animal behaviour. "19 If this statement is true, as I believe it is to a large extent, what was the purpose of this anthropomorphism? Huxley seemed to hold up the virtuous "marital life" of birds - monogamy, shared responsibility, caring for offspring - as examples of proper relations between the human sexes. In a very real sense, he was promoting a "learn from the animals" moral that other Edwardian writers of animal stories had been advancing for decades. In several places in his courtship paper Huxley goes beyond using the same terminology to apply to human and avian sexual relations (such as "sexual emotion," "ecstatic motion") and makes comparisons between birds and the sexual behavior he supports in humans: 16 Ibid., p. 5 10 7 Ibid., p. 526.

BARTLEY The "courtship actions" of man are mostly predetermined by heredity: any young couple that you like to take will be pretty certain to "express their emotion" by holding each other's hands, by putting their arms round each other's waists, or by kissing each other; and of this last action kissing on the mouth is the "highest development." Let us merely notice that these actions are not perhaps exactly parallel with what we find in the grebe ... on the whole, however, they are not very different.20 Huxley believed that the mind of birds was not very different from our own - birds had emotions and desires; they experienced joy, anger, and jealousy, and they were capable of expressing their emotion in their mutually "satisfying" courtship "dances." Clearly, he was interested in comparing the minds of birds and humans in order to draw evolutionary connections between organisms. He believed that if we are connected in an evolutionary sense, then we must all share physical as well as mental characteristics. While I believe that evolutionary arguments were important to Huxley's understanding of bird and human behavior, he appears to reach beyond mere evolutionary theorizing and chooses to emphasize those traits in grebes which he also finds socially admirable: The great crested grebe is a species in which the two sexes play nearly equal parts in all activities concerned with the family. The cock shares equally in nest-building, nearly equally in incubation and early care of the young ... Thus, from the point of view of the species, it is obviously of importance that there should be a form of "marriage" - a constancy, at least for the season - between the members of a pair. The same result - marriage - is observable in such a species as man; but in man the main cause is a division of labour between male and female, whereas in the grebe the sexes have been made as similar as possible.21 Perhaps his most explicit declaration of the proper sexual behavior for humans was in a series of six public lectures on "Biology and Man" given when Huxley was a faculty member at the newly formed Rice Institute in Houston, Texas.22 In the second of these addresses, delivered on January 26, 1916, he spoke on "Biology and Sex" and suggested that in order for humans to progress to a higher evolutionary state they must rid themselves of antiquated views on the inequality of the sexes. He said that the purpose of this talk was "to try to see whether the facts of Biology helped us to decide 20 Huxley, "Courtship-habits" (above, n. 6), p. 5 10. 2 Ibid., p. 516. 22 Huxley's copies of these lectures on "Biology and Man" are in JSH Archive, Box 57: 1910-1916, Rice Lectures.</page><page sequence="7">JULIAN HUXLEY'S STUDIES ON BIRD BEHAVIOR 97 our attitude towards this problem of human life."23 He explained that "man grumbles at woman; but he has made woman what she is," and that during the course of evolution, woman has been economically and biologically dependent on man to such an extent that man could "impose himself and his ideals on her and her growth"; thus man has impeded the progress of woman, changing "the inherited constitution of the whole sex" and making a woman's "possibility of achievement not only different from, but less than, man's"24 Huxley mentioned that a similar argument had been made by Have- lock Ellis in Man and Woman - which, incidentally, he had received in 191 1, the same year he conducted the grebe study. Huxley's own copy of the book was lightly annotated.25 While Huxley was concerned about the status of women in society, his main concern was for the continued improvement in the species as a whole: "If the human race is the custodian of its own destinies .. . then our general duty becomes very clear. It is to make possible the creation of as many of these masterpieces of evolution as is possible. In the words of Gladstone, the chief end of life is the formation of character."26 Huxley declared that in order for humans to continue on this path of progress the female sex must be lifted up to its highest potential. Women must have "more reality": "More fresh air; more healthy exercise; more responsibility; more familiarity with the problems of the community; more realization of the part they can play in solving these problems. Give woman equal rights with man; she will accept equal duties. Give her the chance to work out her own salvation, not under the restraints of a man imposed convention, but trusting in her own good sense."27 Huxley went further: "Give her the vote: it will start her on the upward path, of feeling responsibility in national and local affairs, on which that same privilege has begun to start the male sex."28 By lifting up women, the race as a whole would continue to improve: "what we have most to fear is that the woman's movement shall become a woman's movement pure and simple, instead of the 'human beings' movement - that the upward trend of evolution of which the human race is guardian may be split into two streams with separate and possibly conflicting aims, instead of being added one to the other."29 23 Ibid., p.

BARTLEY At this point in the lecture, Huxley invoked mutual sexual selection and lessons from the grebes as techniques to ease the "sex-war": "If you admire independence, clearness of mental vision in woman, and cease to desire only pretty toys, doll-nature and pretty simplicity [they] will fall, by the operation of sexual selection, to about the same percentage in woman as in man."30 Through mutual sexual selection "there will be, in the relations of the sexes, less stress upon sex-difference and its merely excitant qualities, and more stress upon the sharing of common pleasures. And with this, as in the Grebe, there will inevitably go the transference of the qualities of each sex to the other."3' He believed that both men and women would benefit from this arrangement: "For every dollar's worth of independence and intellect transferred from the account of man to that of woman, there will be transferred a corresponding credit of tendemess and intuition in the opposite direction, so that each again, as in the Grebe, will be richer than before."32 Huxley suggested that when man is no longer dominant over woman, then a woman will be free to choose her own destiny and to choose the type of man she values most highly: when the ideals and conventions which regulate woman's being are no longer framed by him, then for the first time in history woman will be free, not only to lead a more independent life, not only to frame her own ideas for herself, but to frame an ideal of man which shall be just as effective for selection as man's ideal of woman. Whatever guiding power resides in Sexual Selection will then become absolutely mutual between the sexes. Whatever change for the better will have been effected by the final freedom of woman will be reflected in her ideal of life, and that in turn will be reflected, through sexual selection, to influence male nature.33 Thus, mutual sexual selection could lead to the continued improvement of men: "To put the whole matter in a nutshell, if ideas rule the world, then the complete emancipation of women will decrease the number of those rulers that are stupid, petty, self-sufficient, and prejudice, and add to the number that make for happiness and progress in their dominions."34 While Huxley felt it was necessary that women be raised up in order for the species to progress, he felt that a man and a woman must work together within a marriage for true progress to occur: "the family must be maintained as a unit, and the members of the pair must be kept together, and kept constant 30 Ibid., p.

This will give the greatest biological advantage to the race, and the greatest mass of joy to the two partners of the bond. In the fewest possible words, this mutual selection, as we may call it, that grows up as the result of shared family life, has as its consequences and products the development of a fund of beauty and possibilities of joy in both sexes alike, which is to be shared by them together.36 Huxley viewed mutual sexual selection as a decided improvement over "the older, simpler relation when there was little family life, and fertilization was the one thing necessary .. . the sharing of nothing but momentary excitement by both sexes."37 He also pointed out that in this older system, the male was "waste material for the race except at the single moment of fertilization."38 I have cited this lecture in detail because I think it provides strong evi- dence to support the conclusion that Huxley's views on the mating behavior of grebes were intimately connected to his political and social beliefs for the improvement of humans. It is no coincidence that his public lecture empha- sizing equality of the sexes was given in the midst of the active suffragist movement in both the United States and England in the 1910s.39 In the first few decades of this century, women in Europe and the United States were pushing for the right to vote, were organizing into political and economic forces, and were demanding (and receiving) greater access to higher educa- tion. While some British scientists of the day, especially those with strong ties to the Eugenics Education Society, were using arguments from evolutionary theory to declare that the proper role for women was the traditional one of 3 Ibid., p. 15. 36 Ibid., pp. 17-18. 7 Ibid., p. 18. 38 Ibid., p. 19. 39 Susan Kingsley Kent, in Sex and Suffrage in Britain, 1860-1914 (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1987), argues that both British men and women favoring the right of women to vote were eager to discuss the vote in relation to issues of sex and sexuality. She suggests that the British suffrage movement, in particular, was a struggle for "a positive paradigm of female sexuality." For an interesting account of the suffrage movement in Texas in the 191 Os see A. Elizabeth Taylor, Citizens at Last: The Woman's Suffrage Movement in Texas (Austin: Temple, 1987). In the foreword to this book, Taylor argues that Texan support of suffrage was linked to the respectability of women's clubs such as the Texas Christian Temperance Union.</page><page sequence="10">100 MARY M. BARTLEY caretaker of the home and of children,40 Huxley, perhaps in the tradition of his mother Julian Arnold (founder of Prior's Field School for Girls) and his maternal grandmother Mary Arnold (later Mrs. Humphry Ward, the novelist), was a strong proponent of women's education and women's rights in general. He was a liberal - he supported access to birth control, sexual satisfaction for women as well as men, and sexual pleasure for its own sake.4' By using the grebe, he could point out that equality was present in a "lower" species but was lacking in the human species, which he believed had "progressed" the furthest. Huxley seemed to have little difficulty moving from humans to grebes and back again; the grebe case supported his views on the equality of the sexes, the desire for women's right to vote, the benefits of monoga- mous marriages, and, perhaps most importantly, the continued progress of humans. After finishing his work on grebes, Huxley turned to other species with similar attributes of monogamy and little sexual dimorphism. He wrote of that period: "I was determined to explore [mutual courtship] further, and what more suitable object was I likely to find than egrets and the rest of the heron family?"42 He was still at Rice during this period (1915), and he took up his studies of mutual courtship in the Louisiana bayou. Again, he found pairs of birds in a "highly charged emotional state."43 Huxley put the behavior into Darwinian terms: "what was originally a by-product, a pure spill-over, must now have some function, for otherwise selection could not have operated to enhance it, adorning or exaggerating just the parts which are most conspicuously displayed in the process"; he concluded that the displays "'acted as an emotional bond, serving to keep the pair together throughout the breeding season. This where both sexes are needed for incubation and for the care of the young, must be of real importance."" Upon his return to England after service in World War I, and in the midst of a new research program on sex determination in axolotls, Huxley continued to discuss courtship in birds in the many lectures he gave on the subject. At the Royal Institution in London, he drew upon his understanding of mutual sexual selection in animals to discuss the similarities between the human sexes. He said that this similarity was evident in popular practices such as the 40 See R. A. Fisher, "The Eugenic Aspect of the Employment of Married Women: A Reply," Eugen. Rev., 6 (1914), 313-314.

G. and G. P. Wells (1929-1930), Huxley's chapter on bird courtship draws direct connections between birds and humans: "It looks as if the elaborate display-ceremonies constituted an emotional bond between the pair, which, by helping to keep them together through the season, cemented a union which was of biological value. This is no fantastic suggestion, for something of the same sort is at work in human family life."47 Ducks and "Disharmony" It should be noted that Huxley was well aware of other birds whose mating behavior did not fit well with the hopes he had for humans. In 1912, he reported a case of "disharmony" in the mating behavior of the wild duck (Anas boschas);48 he borrowed this term from the Russian embryologist and immunologist Elie Metchnikoff (I1845-1916), who wrote a detailed treatment of "disharmonies" in The Nature of Man: Studies in Optimistic Philosophy (1903).49 Huxley cites Metchnikoff in his paper on ducks, in his grebe paper, in the public addresses he gave at Rice in 1916, and later in The Science of Life. I suspect that he was extremely interested in Metchnikoff's "optimistic philosophy" on human progress; when Metchnikoff wrote of "an ideal able to unite men in a kind of religion of the future," and ideal "founded on scientific principles,"50 Huxley might well have substituted "evolution" for Metchnikoff's use of the term "science." Metchnikoff believed that organisms 45See The Birmingham Gazette, January 23, 1925, p. 8; and The Daily Sketch, January 23, 1925, p. 12. 46See The Daily Herald, August 11, 1926, p 6; Westminster Gazette, August 11, 1926, p. 20; and Liverpool Post, August 9, 1926, p. 5.

BARTLEY were in a state of dishannony and that life was a constant struggle to improve toward the harmonious condition. He applied his concept of disharmony to various structures in the human body, such as wisdom teeth, which he believed were liable to cause pain and were the source for infections of the mouth.5' He equated disharmonies with structures that are "badly adapted" for either the life of the individual or that of the species.52 He believed that humans, in particular, have struggled against their disharmonies and, through this process, have "progressed." Metchnikoff's interest in the continued improvement of man through an understanding of science undoubtedly struck a responsive chord in Julian Huxley. In his paper on duck mating behavior, Huxley defined "disharmony" as a missing adaptation leading to harmful results for the species. He observed that during mating in this bird, numerous males mobbed a single female in an attempt to mate. In some cases, the female would be forced underwater by the males during the repeated mating attempts and would eventually drown. Huxley reported that he found the act "a painful and repulsive sight"; he estimated that 7-10% of the females were killed this way every year, and he stated that "the loss to the species is very considerable, and this loss is caused by a property of the species itself, i.e., is due to a Disharmony in the constitution of the species."53 Huxley seemed to disapprove of this scene from both a moral and a scientific viewpoint; since male ducks were killing off females of their own species, and doing it in a graphic manner, he invoked the term "disharmony," which would eventually either be supplanted by hanronious forces or would cause irreparable damage to the species. Since the ducks were not "properly adapted," they were not capable of progressing in either a moral or a physical sense. It is perhaps worthwhile to mention that "disharmonious" ducks were rarely mentioned in any of Huxley's future writings on bird mating behavior: they did not provide the kind of example, from a standpoint of either moral or adaptive improvement of the species, that he required for his commentary on human progress. Instead, he preferred the aesthetically pleasing grebe, which his wife Juliette latter referred to as "Julian's seraphic symbol."'4 Huxley " Ibid., p. 65.

Juliette Huxley's picture of Huxley's life is somewhat different from Memories. As she tells it, Julian apparently did not believe in monogamy for himself: he had a series of affairs throughout their married life, most seriously with a young American woman whom he described as having "astonishing vitality" and a "combination of adventureness and efficiency with femininity" that was "extremely stimulating to me." Huxley wrote to Juliette to describe the benefits of extramarital freedom: "I am leaming more each year to go ahead and trust to my subconscious</page><page sequence="13">JULIAN HUXLEY'S STUDIES ON BIRD BEHAVIOR 103 used the sex life of the grebe as a model for humans - the grebes seemed to him to have the ideal home-life based on cooperation and mutual respect. They were monogamous and appeared to have achieved "happiness" as they celebrated their marital "joy" with enthusiastic "dances." Huxley used the "emotional" nature of grebes in order to point to mental similarities between humans and birds. While he believed that birds "do not in any way represent a past stage in man's evolutionary development, but have developed divergently along their own lines," he did suggest that "birds were on the whole lower than mammals in pure intelligence, higher in pitch of emotion and intensity of living."55 He wrote that "the sense of beauty in many lower forms must be similar to ours," and that bird courtship "is clearly accompanied by the same general emotions by which human courtship is also accompanied."56 Thus, while insisting on the lack of a direct connection from birds to humans, he pointed to certain aspects of birds, such as their emotional state, as evidence for ranking them "higher" or "lower" with respect to mammals. John C. Greene's belief that Huxley had human progress in mind when he distinguished between "grades" and "clades"57 seems supported here in Huxley's work with birds - emotionally, the birds constituted a higher "grade" of evolution than some mammals, but structurally, they were not in the same dclade." The Dilemma of Sexual Selection Thus far, I have discussed Huxley's commitment to human progress in terms of the sexual progress he believed was necessary in order to elevate the group. To Huxley, sex equalization was not a disembodied political idea; rather, it was a "scientific" imperative if progress were to continue. In his discussion of sex roles, he often emphasized the need for cooperation between the sexes, through which real improvement would be achieved. To ensure that progress would occur on a broader scale, behaviors that promoted the individual at the expense of the group would have to be eliminated, or at least deemphasized. Sexual selection was a tricky issue for Huxley because, on the one hand, Darwin had invented the term and Huxley was quick to portray himself feelings...

BARTLEY as a thoroughgoing Darwinian; on the other hand, sexual selection on the individual often came into conflict with the promotion of "good" traits for the group. Perhaps the most visible result of sexual selection is the appearance of seem- ingly maladaptive characteristics (such as gaudy male plumage in birds). If these maladaptive traits are able to accumulate in the species, how could progress, in any real sense, still occur? Huxley's dilemma over how to approach sexual selection lasted nearly thirty years. In that period, he progres- sively retreated from a position in which he initially accepted female choice as well as male-male competition58 to a position in which sexual selection could only be acceptable if it looked remarkably like natural selection.59 This back-pedaling was not just semantics; Huxley believed that sexual selection was not progressive. In fact, he believed it could impede the progress that would occur under natural selection. What was his solution? Huxley, the "synthesizer," somehow managed a compromise between seemingly opposite forces. He advocated "mutual sexual selection" - a process by which characteristics were transferred from one sex to another, until gradually the two sexes looked similar. Over and over again in his published writings, he used the similar features of grebes to illustrate that such a transference had occurred; they became the symbol of cooperative and progressive change. It is perhaps difficult to understand how he reconciled this mutual sexual selection with what he clearly must have observed in many other bird species - namely, that the sexes of many species are dramatically dimorphic. Perhaps the fact that he worked mainly with birds that showed little sexual dimorphism partly explains his stance. Huxley believed that Darwinian sexual selection involving male-male com- petition did not make sense in the monogamous, non-sexually-dimorphic grebe. He asked, "To what end are colours and structures developed ... and what return is got for the time and energy spent in carrying them out?" - and his answer was strongly in favor of natural selection and generally against sexual selection (unless the theory was modified): "They [colours and struc- tures] are common to both sexes, and so have nothing to do with any forn of true sexual selection; they are self-exhausting processes, not leading up to or connected with coition, and cannot be sexual excitants, in the ordinary 58 Huxley, "Secondary Sexual Characters" (above, n. 9), pp. 601-602; and Julian Huxley, "A First Account of the Courtship of the Redshank (Totanus calidris, L.)," Proc.

He downplays those traits which do not seem to have a function aside from attracting mates; thus, the only traits he is left with are those which he includes under the heading of natural selection. Like others who had wrestled with the problem of sexual selection, Huxley questioned one of the chief difficulties of sexual selection - female choice. In The Descent of Man, Darwin suggested that females were capable of choosing from among potential mates.62 Wallace and Darwin corresponded at length on the issue of female choice; Wallace did not believe that female choice, if it existed at all, was powerful enough to account for sexual dimorphism.63 In the years that followed, nearly every commentator on the subject denied that females were capable of creating such profound changes in the other sex.64 In his 1914 grebe paper, Huxley argued that male characters act on the "emotional state" of the female birds. He wrote that displays act as "exci- tants" and "aphrodisiacs" which bring the female "into that state of exaltation and emotion when alone she will be ready to pair.'65 He not only accepted an emotional component to sexual selection, but he believed that grebes had a kind of "choice" similar to the kind of female choice that he believed operated in humans. He stated that in birds, "the element of choice does, in another form, remain," and that mating was sometimes guided by "impulse and indi- vidual predilection," and he suggested that these impulses were "choice" in their rudimentary condition: we find that form of "'choice" - intuitive, unreasoned, but none the less imperious, and none the less in its result a true choice - which reaches its highest stage of development in the intensely felt affinities of man and woman - in that condition known as "falling in love," where the whole of 60 Huxley, "Courtship-habits" (above, n. 6), p. 516. 61 Ibid., p. 559. 62 Charles Darwin, The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex (London: John Mur-ay, 187 1), I, 26 1. 63 Malcolm Jay Kottler, "Darwin, Wallace, and the Origin of Sexual Dimorphism," Proc.

BARTLEY the subconscious mental activities become grafted on to inherited sexual passions, the whole past of the mental organism is summed up in the present, in the intensely real act of choice which chooses one from among thousands and says, whether in words or no, "that one being, and no other, is the being that I desire for my mate.''66 While Huxley accepted the possibility of female choice in general, he believed that it was probably not a major factor for the grebes since males and females performed similar roles during courtship. By 1938, he had changed his tune on sexual selection: "In general, it has now become clear that the hypoth- esis of female choice and of selection between rival males irrespective of general biological advantage is inapplicable to the great majority of display characters."67 While congratulating Darwin for his "positive achievement," he seemed to retreat from his earlier, more pluralistic stance. What caused this change in opinion? Certainly, the 1938 papers were not the result of Huxley's own new scien- tific researches: in 1926 he began his collaboration with H. G. and G. P. Wells on The Science of Life, and from that point he left empirical research behind him. In a short paper written for Nature in 1921, he describes some of the reasons why he questioned the idea of sexual selection. First, grebes and other birds often mate before the mating ceremonies take place; thus, he argues, the mating rituals can have little influence on the actual "choice" of a mate. Huxley cites W. Finkler's research on newts and A. H. Sturtevant's studies on Drosophila to suggest that males are necessary in order to serve as an "exci- tant" to the female; after the female is suitably aroused, mating can take place with any male, regardless of his qualities. Huxley also states that "true sexual selection" may occur only in those species in which there is polygamy.68 This sentiment is echoed in his 1938 paper: "competition between males for mates, accompanied by any form of female choice, is not the common phenomenon postulated by Darwin, but apparently confined to the relatively few species practising polygamy or with a high excess of males."69 In effect, by 1921 Huxley had already declared that sexual selection was of minor importance in evolution. I suggest that part of the reason Huxley downplayed sexual selection is that it interfered with the kind of harmonious relationships he believed were at the core of human progress. By relegating sexual selection to the special 66 Ibid. 67 Huxley, "Standing of Theory of Sexual Selection" (above, n. 59), p. 12. 68 Julian Huxley, "The Accessory Nature of Many Structures and Habits Associated with Courtship," Nature, 108, (1921), 566. 69 Huxley, "Courtship-habits" (above, n. 6), p. 417.</page><page sequence="17">JULIAN HUXLEY'S STUDIES ON BIRD BEHAVIOR 107 case of polygamy, he could declare that sexual selection was not the "normal" state of affairs. Instead, "normality" revolved around a home-life modeled by the grebes - monogamous, "harmonious," progressive; in short, he believed they were good role models for humans. I also suggest that given Huxley's commitment to the idea of continued improvement in humans, he chose to deemphasize the results from sexually dimorphic species because individual selection for particular male traits might take precedence over advantageous traits for the group. If males and females evolved along different evolutionary trajectories such that the sexes became more and more divergent, Huxley's philosophy of cooperative improvement would not be supported. However, he seemed to believe that if the two sexes could improve together, a more harmonious and therefore more progressive race would evolve. Conclusions: Bird Courtship and Human Progress Huxley's choice of a monogamous bird species, one with aesthetically pleasing courtship behavior, and one with "equality of the sexes," provided a prospect of the bright future he envisioned for humans. He invoked the mechanism of mutual sexual selection, by which one sex would improve upon the physical and emotional features of the other; both sexes would benefit and, in turn, so would the entire species. While I am suggesting that Huxley assumed strong similarities between birds and humans, interestingly, he clearly sepa- rated himself from biologists who looked at "the behavior of the birds and simply anthropomorphized, with human motives and thoughts read into it throughout."70 He was keen to associate his own work within a Darwinian framework, which he said looked to "utility as the key to evolution."71 By invoking mutual sexual selection in terms of the benefit each sex would gain from the other, he could be a "Darwinian" and still draw upon bird examples to illustrate qualities in humans. Huxley was extremely interested in political and social change throughout his life - from his essay at Oxford in which he complained of the barbaric nature of commercialized meat production,72 to his respect for feminists in the 1920s, to his director-generalship at UNESCO in 1946. Although it may seem odd at first glance, his work on birds was part of that political and social agenda. The "equality" he saw in grebes was the equality he hoped for in humans; if women were allowed to vote, they would begin the process toward eventual sex equality and improvement of the species. 70 Huxley, "Courtship of Birds" (above, n. 56), p. 1.

BARTLEY When Huxley's scientific work is situated within his wider program of human progress, his science does not appear to be a separate entity from his political and social agenda. In fact, it was inextricably connected to sociopolitical goals. His continual choice of species that showed little sexual dimorphism allowed him to make repeated "scientific" claims as to the need for sexual equality and sexual reform. The birds provided evidence for his assertion that women and men must work together - not against each other, as in a "sex-war" - in order for the species to progress. Even though he admitted that the birds were still just birds, they served as models for human sexual behavior. Huxley's commitment to human progress at the beginning of his scientific career indicates that a reappraisal of his other scientific researches may be in order. For example, he discussed Metchnikoff's "disharmonies" in the conclusion to his first book The Individual in the Animal Kingdom in 1911, one year prior to his research on grebes.73 He wrote in the last paragraph, "The ideals of active harmony and mutual aid as the best means to power and progress . .. cannot but help to support and direct those men upon whom devolves the task of moulding and inspiring that unwieldiest individual - formless and blind to-day, but huge with possibility - the State."74 Here he makes a direct comparison between the relation of the individual to the whole and the responsibility of individual humans to the State. Undoubtedly there is a great deal more at issue for Huxley in his book on "individuals" than just a description of invertebrates. Given the existence of cases such as those I have presented in this paper, we may need to reevaluate Huxley's science in light of his worldview.
