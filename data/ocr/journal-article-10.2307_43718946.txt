<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Straight-Legged Cherubim of Ezekiel's Inaugural Vision (Ezekiel 1:7a) W. BOYD BARRICK Ohio Northern University Ada, OH 45810 The description of the coming of Yahweh in Ezekiel 1 has more than its share of exegetical puzzles. A case in point is v. 7. Of the four "living creatures" ( hayyôt ) bearing the divine throne it is said: wëraglêhem regel yěšará, wěkap raglêhem kěkap regel cēgel wěnosěsím kěcen něhošet qālāl (MT).1 The problems in this short verse are considerable, and not a few commentators despair of ever recovering the sense intended by the author.2 Especially troublesome are the last four words, which may mean "glittering like a disc of bronze" (as proposed by G. R. Driver and adopted by the NEBy or "and they sparkled like burnished bronze" (with the RSV, JB , NAB , and most commentators). The remainder of the verse also is unclear and has attracted less scholarly attention. Most commentators take regel to mean "leg" in v. 7a (cf. the LXX), although elsewhere in Ezekiel the word is used only in the narrower literal sense of "foot."4 Yšr can denote the oppo- 1 LXX: kai ta skelē autõn ortha, kai pterõtoi hoi podes autõn, kai spinthēres, hõs exastraptõn chalkos, kai elaphrai hai pteryges autõn; Targum: wrglyhwn rglyn kywnn wprst rglhwn kprst rglyn sglgln wmzycn clmD bmhkwn wmnsnsn kcyn nhš mslhb; Vg: pedes eorum pedes recti, et planta pedis eorum quasi planta vituli, et scintillae quasi aspectus aeris candentis. 2 So, e.g., G. A. Cooke, The Book of Ezekiel (ICC; 2 vols.; New York: Scribners, 1937), 1. 12 ("the original form of the text is beyond recovery"); J. W. Wevers, Ezekiel (NCB; London: Nelson, 1969) 45 ("what was originally intended is impossible of recovery"). 3 G. R.

Common usage favors a reference to the "soles of the feet," but the more general sense "feet" is by no means impossible (cf. Isa 60: 14, and note also 1 Sam 5:4), especially if regel should mean "leg" in v. 7a. Whatever the precise anatomical reference, the creatures' feet are said to resemble a calf's hoof in some way. But here too the text is unstable and probably beyond certainty.7 It is commonly assumed on the basis of v. 7ba that the creatures were hoofed.8 But what of the seemingly gratuitous regel yěšarál According to one popular view, the creatures' legs were "straight" because they lacked knee-joints; without knee-joints their legs could not bend and, lacking also kneecaps, would have been smooth and unblemished.9 A more bizarre pic- ture is advocated by commentators such as Hans Schmidt who, seeing in Ezekiel 1 reflections of cultic furniture, reconstruct the creatures with peg- like table legs.10 Alternatively, Walther Eichrodt claims that yěšará refers to bëhëmâ). Cf. also 2:1, 2; 3:24; 6:1 1; 24:17, 23; 25:6; 32:2; 34:18, 19; 37:10; 43:7. Either "feet" or "legs" would suit the image in 16:25. 5 See 1 Kgs 6:35; Isa 40:3-4; 45:2; Mie 3:9; Prov 2: 13-15; 8:8-9; 14:2. Yšr usually carries a moral sense, "righteous, upright" (Num 23: 10; Deut 32:4; Jer 26: 14; Mie 7:2; Hab 2:4; Ps 33: 1 ; 36:1 1; etc.), and rarely is used in physical descriptions. 6 Cf. W. Zimmerli, Ezekiel (tr. R. E. Clements; ed. F. M. Cross et al.; Hermeneia; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1979), 1. 87. 7 Cf. C. H. Toy, The Book of the Prophet Ezekiel (SBOT 12; Baltimore: Johns Hop- kins, 1899) 42; Zimmerli, Ezekiel , 1. 83. See the following note. 8 Alternatively, the targum (cf. also Aq.) envisions creatures with "rounded" feet. Some commentators emend the MT accordingly: e.g., O. Procksch, "Die Berufungsvision Hesekiels," BZAW 34 (1920) 142, 145; W. Eichrodt, Ezekiel: A Commentary (tr. C. Quin; OTL; Lon- don: SCM, 1970) 49, 50 n. i. Zimmerli too is suspicious ( Ezekiel , 1, 126). Other advocates of this interpretation find it compatible with the MT reading: e.g., W. F. Lofthouse, Ezekiel (NCB 18; New York: Frowde, [1907]) 56-57; D. M. G. Stalker, Ezekiel (Torch; London: SCM, 1968)46. Wevers emends the text in the direction of the LXX ( Ezekiel , 45). No compelling text-critical argument has been advanced for abandoning the MT. 9 E.g., A. B. Davidson, The Book of Ezekiel (Cambridge Bible for Schools and Col- leges; Cambridge: Cambridge, 1893) 5f.; R. Kraetzschmar, Das Buch Ezechiel (HK AT 3/3; Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1900) 11; Lofthouse, Ezekiel , 56-57; O. Procksch, BZ A W 34(1920) 142; S. Fisch, Ezekiel (Soncino; London: Soncino, 1950)3; D. M. G. Stalker, Ezekiel , 46. This view goes back to Rashi. 10 H.

The bull-leg theory, born of unsup- ported emendation, is at best a solution of last resort. The no-knee theory is a guess without substantiation of any sort.13 The peg-leg theory is little better, but it does attempt to confine speculation to a definite conceptual context - the plastic arts. More substantial is Eichrodťs proposal which is derived from 1:5b: wězeh marDêhen dèmût Dādām lāhēnnā. The inference is attractive, although there is nothing in the phrase regel yěšará which com- pels it; straight-legged ness (or straight-footedness) is not in itself a distinc- tively anthropomorphic trait.14 More damaging, however, is the fact that Eichrodts interpretation does not take into account the complex redactional history of this material. As Walther Zimmerli has shown, there is good reason to believe that the anthropomorphic reference in v. 5 belongs to the original stratum of composition, but that the description of the creatures' lower extremities in v. 7 is part of an extensive redrafting of the visionary report by later hands.15 Zimmerli's analysis is based, in part, on the erratic use of pronominal suffixes throughout Ezekiel 1. The masculine suffixes such as occur in v. 7 cannot properly refer to the grammatically feminine hayyôt of v. 5, but point instead to the grammatically masculine kërûbîm found in Ezekiel 10. Indeed, some connection between the "living creatures" and the "cherubim" is called for by 10:15, 20, 22, which explicitly equate the two. Zimmerli argues that this equation is the result of the efforts of later redactors to connect and harmonize what were originally two unrelated visionary reports. Both chapters have grown to their present state through a complex process of redactional cross-pollenation. Originally Ezekiel 10 spoke only of a single cherub, one of the two which stood in the Jerusalem Temple (vv. 2a, 4a, 7a); secondarily, this figure was multiplied and other descriptive details woven into the narrative to identify these "cherubim" with the four "living 11 W.

In the original stratum of composition they are described simply as human in form and with four wings in various positions, stylized hybrids the antecedents for which Zimmerli finds in the seraphim of Isaiah 6. 17 In the redactional strata, however, the breed of creature has changed. There, under the influence of Ezekiel 10, the Temple cherubim emerge as the dominant strain. Zimmerli's analysis bears directly on the interpretation of regel yěšará in 1:7a. Taking regel in the expanded sense of "leg," contrary to normal usage in the book, becomes less problematic once v. 7 is recognized as a secondary addition in which a vocabular anomaly of this sort might be expected. Furthermore, since v. 5 and v. 7 belong to different compositional strata which conceptualize the "living creatures" somewhat differently, the sole basis for Eichrodťs understanding of the phrase disappears. Conversely, the suggestion of Schmidt and others that this material should be examined in terms of the plastic arts is strengthened. In view of the redactors' motives in redrawing the "living creatures," such an examination must begin with a consideration of the cherubim. Ezekiel 1 is rooted in a mythological pairing of Yahweh with a vehicle, comparable to the vehicular imagery associated with such deities as Baal and Marduk among Israel's cultural neighbors.18 In the mythology of weather- deiies the vehicle is the storm-cloud, commonly envisioned as an animal or wheeled conveyance (a cart or chariot drawn by an animal) upon which the deity rode into battle against his cosmic enemies.19 This mythological vehicle appears in several guises in Israelite poetic tradition: a cloud (Isa 19:1; cf. Ps 68:5); a chariot (Ps 104:3; cf. Hab 3:8; Ps 68:18); a cherub (2 Sam 22 [Ps 1 8]: 11). Ezekiel's man-like "living creatures," bearing the deity envel- oped in cloud, are another variation on this theme. In the redaction, how- ever, they are implicitly identified with the two cherubim which stood in the Jerusalem Temple. Those golden figures personified the divine vehicle, their 16 W. Zimmerli, Ezekiel , 1. 232-33, 250. 17 Zimmerli considers vv. 5, 6b, and lib to be original, rejecting the reference to the multiple faces of the creatures (vv. 6a and 10) as being "without recognizable precedent in the Old Testament conceptual world" (ibid., 103a; cf. 125-26). Freedy includes vv. 6a and 9a ( VT 20 [1970] 134). 18 For comparable data, see K. Tallqvist, Akkadische Götterepitheta (Studia orientalia 7; Helsinki: Societas orientalis fennica, 1938) 175; M.

Their two "outstretched" wings which "touched each other in the middle of the house" (1 Kgs 6:27; cf. 2 Chr 3:1 1-12) also formed the seat of a divine throne, the rest of the cherubic anatomy forming its sides, arms, and legs.21 Vehicle and throne coalesced in a single piece of cultic furniture. As furniture- components the cherub figures supporting the throne symbolically propelled the deity seated upon it through the clouds of smoke which filled the Temple room - a close approximation of the poetic image in 2 Sam 22 (Ps 1 8): 1 1.22 The redaction of Ezekiel 1 expands upon this basic concept. Introduction of the chariot motif, a mythological element which seems to have been entirely suppressed in the iconography of the Temple furnishings,23 transforms the vehicle into a wheeled throne. The redrafted "living creatures," like their antecedents in the Temple, propel this throne and are integrated into its physical structure. It seems reasonable to suppose that this description of the wheeled throne has been informed, to some degree, by objects with which the redac- tors were personally acquainted. Speculation about the wheels in particular has moved in this direction, seeking parallels in Mesopotamia, Persia, and beyond.24 Zimmerli may be quite right in viewing the entire apparatus as an approximation of "the Mesopotamian type of mobile processional sanctu- ary."25 Nonetheless, some of these descriptive details may just as well derive from the furnishings of the Jerusalem Temple as they actually had existed or were remembered or as they were recalled in the traditions (literary or other- wise) to which the redactors had access. Clearly, however, the search for specific conceptual prototypes, whether in the Temple furnishings or in the plastic arts of the ancient Near East generally, lacks both the evidential and methodological controls necessary to rise much above the level of educated guesswork. This caveat applies also for speculation about the creatures. Artistic imagination in the ancient Near East produced a veritable menagerie of fantastic composite beasts, any number of which could have been familiar to the redactors - or, for that matter, to Ezekiel himself. In terms of literary influence, Zimmerli's claim that Ezekiel's man-like "living creatures" were 20 See Deut 32:1 1; Jer 48:40; 49:22; Job 39:26. Note that the Temple figures are said to have both wings extended (1 Kgs 6:27; 2 Chr 3:1 1-12), an exact duplication of this posture. 21 See M. Haran, Temples and Temple Service , 252 (= IEJ 9 [1959] 35-36); O. Keel, The Symbolism of the Biblical World (tr. T. J.

But it is possible to divorce completely his creatures from the various man-like beasts which populate the seals and palace walls of contemporary Mesopotamia,26 or the Egyptian breeds extant in the Samaria ivories?27 On the contrary, it is probable that both sources have contributed to the original portrayal, but beyond this supposition we cannot go: we know next to nothing about what a seraph might have looked like to Isaiah,28 much less to Ezekiel.29 Regarding the Temple cherubim the biblical writers have left us slightly better informed: they were gold-plated, winged, and (according to 2 Chr 3:13b) "stood on their feet/ legs " (raglêhem) in the Temple room. It is their throne-like function which provides the best clue to their physical appearance. Of the many fantastic beasts known from Syro-Palestinian art one species has a special association with thrones: the so-called "winged sphinx."30 It is widely believed that the Temple cherubim were creatures of this general type. Admittedly, this identification has no solid evidence behind it, although it is perhaps not coincidental that creatures of this type do occur with some frequency in portrayals of the Storm-God in Mesopotamian glyptic.31 But even if this identification is correct, it cannot automatically be transferred to the redactionally augmented creatures of Ezekiel 1; there are too many uncontrolled variables.

There is at least nothing in the ambiguous wording of v. 7 to preclude this interpretation.32 Quadrupeds of all sorts are commonplace in the extant representational art of the ancient Near East. Also commonplace are two stylistic conventions in the portrayal of such animals. When a quadruped is depicted in motion, the animal is shown with its four legs either extended in a quasi-"flying gallop"33 or in a more naturalistic prancing or walking position. When a stationary quadruped is depicted, however, its front legs are together and more-or-less perpendicular to the ground - in a word, "straight." Although many variations occur, these poses are absolutely conventional in the artistic canon of the OT world.34 The second of these conventions offers an entirely plausible explanation for the "straight" legs of the cherub-like crea- tures in Ezekiel 1: their legs were "straight" because they were not under- stood to be walking. It is quite true, of course, that the creatures in Ezekiel 1 are in motion. How can a quadruped be in motion and stationary simultaneously? This very paradox was achieved by the sculptors who combined both conventions to create the five-legged winged colossi to guard the royal residences in Assyria and Persia.35 Viewed from the side these creatures are striding for- ward, but viewed from the front they are standing still. It should be noted 32 Regarding the number of legs specified, cf. the almost identical wording of 1 Kgs 7:33a - ûmacasêh h&amp;ôpannîm kèmacã'sêh J ôpan hammerkābā- which describes each of the four wheels of Solomon's cult-stands. 33 Cf.

Both conventions continue well beyond the biblical period; see, e.g., R. du Mesnil du Buisson, Les peintures de la synagogue de Doura- Europos (Scripta pontificii institūti biblici 86; Rome: Biblical Institute, 1939) 114 and pl.

The creatures, as part of the construction of the divine chariot-throne, rolled along on the wheels which were activated by the "spirit" of the creatures (vv. 19-21). 37 In addition, the creatures seem also to have used their wings for flight - or so the statement that they let down their wings when standing still (v. 25b; cf. vv. 23-24) would suggest - another echo of the Temple cherubim which stood immobile on their legs while soaring on outstretched wings. To summarize: In the extensive redaction of Ezekiel 1 the man-like "living creatures" envisioned by the prophet have been transformed into cherubic quadrupeds reminiscent of the golden figures of the Temple. Their legs were "straight" because these creatures did not use their legs for pur- poses of locomotion. This explanation, although speculative, is consistent with both the internal literary evidence and external artistic evidence. And it does not unnecessarily deprive the poor creatures of their kneecaps. 36 Cf. w. Zimmerli, Ezekiel , 1. 121b, 129. 37 Ibid., 129-130.</page></plain_text>
