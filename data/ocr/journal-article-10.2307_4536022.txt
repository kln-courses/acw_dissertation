AN OBSERVATIONAL STUDY USING AINSWORTH'S STRANGE SITUATION by EMANUELA PRATO-PREVIDE1'3), DEBORAH MARY CUSTANCE2), CATERINA SPIEZIO1) and FRANCESCA SABATINI114) Istituto di Psicologia, Universita di Milano, Italy; 2 Goldsmith College, Department of Psychology, University of London) (Acc. 24-1-2003) Summary Ainsworth's 'strange situation' procedure was used to investigate the dog (Canisfamiliaris) - human relationship. 38 adult dog-owner pairs were observed in an unfamiliar room, intro- duced to a human stranger and subjected to four short episodes of separation. The procedure and behavioural analyses were as similar as possible to those used in studying human infants, except for the inclusion of an extra separation period in which the dogs were left alone in the room with articles of clothing belonging to the owner and stranger. A secure base effect was suggested by the fact that the dogs accepted to play with the stranger more in the pres- ence of their owner than during his or her absence. They also explored more in the presence of their owner, but this appeared to be due to diminishing curiosity over time rather than a secure base effect. The dogs also exhibited a range of attachment behaviours, i.e. search and proximity seeking behaviours when separated from their owner, including following, scratch- ing and jumping up on the door, remaining oriented to the door or the owner's empty chair and vocalising. They also greeted their owner more enthusiastically and for longer durations compared to the stranger. Finally, they contacted the owner's clothing more often and for 3) Corresponding authors address: Prof. E. Prato-Previde, Istituto di Psicologia, Universita di Milano, Via T.

Hence, the dogs' behaviour in the strange situ- ation was very similar to that reported in human infants and chimpanzees. However, despite conducting detailed behavioural analyses, the order effects inherent in Ainsworth's procedure prevented the study from providing conclusive evidence that the dog-human bond constitutes an attachment. Keywords: dog, attachment, affectional bonds, Ainsworth, Strange Situation. In recent years, there has been increasing interest in human-dog rela- tionships and literature on this topic has flourished (e.g. Serpell, 1995; Menanche, 1998). Most studies have either explored the issues concerning attachment of humans to their pet dogs (Voith, 1985; Scott, 1992; Enden- burg, 1995; Collis &amp; McNicholas, 1998), the effect of dogs on their owner's well-being and health (Rowan &amp; Beck, 1994; Hart, 1995; Wilson &amp; Turner, 1998), or the relationship between the owner's behaviour and their dogs' behavioural problems (Voith et al., 1992; O'Farrell, 1995; Jagoe &amp; Serpell, 1996). Only a few studies have investigated the nature of the dog's affec- tional tie with its owner, and to our knowledge, the literature contains only one empirical study on this topic (Topal et al., 1998). The sparcity of empirical studies on the dog-human bond is surprising given that dogs have been part of human society for longer than any other domestic species (Clutton-Brock, 1999) and they are by far the most popular species of companion animal (Hart, 1995). All modern dog breeds were do- mesticated as wolves over 10,000 years ago (Serpell, 1995; Clutton-Brock, 1999) and subsequently subjected to an intense process of artificial selection. It has been suggested that artificial selection in dogs has not only favoured specific anatomical and behavioural traits, but also promoted general social- isation (Kretchmer &amp; Fox, 1975) and the predisposition to form attachments with humans (Millott, 1994). The owner-dog relationship resembles the parent-child bond in many ways. People tend to view and treat their dogs as child-like and many be- haviour patterns in dogs, like those of children, seem especially designed to elicit care (Voith, 1985; Askew, 1996). Askew (1996) argued that our pets display evolutionary modifications of ancestral behaviours that function to elicit human parental care. In his opinion, the behaviour of modern pet own- ers towards their dogs not only resembles human parental behaviour, but it actually is parental behaviour directed towards the members of another species.</page><page sequence="3">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 227 Among the various theories aimed to explain mother-infant attachment in humans, the ethological-evolutionary perspective (Bowlby, 1958, 1969/1982; Ainsworth, 1964, 1967, 1969) is probably most compatible with a compara- tive approach. Bowlby's original theory was inspired by work on non-human animals and hence it was rooted in biology with a concern for the adap- tive value of attachment and other related behavioural systems (Bretherton, 1992). According to this view, social animals have evolved a predisposition to form attachment bonds, especially infants with their mothers. Attachment can be considered as a particular kind of affectional bond. Throughout the lifespan, individuals can form a variety of different affec- tional bonds that are not attachments. Thus, in establishing whether a rela- tionship constitutes an attachment, it is important to distinguish it from other types of affectional bonds. All affectional bonds (including attachments) en- dure over time, involve a specific individual and are emotionally significant; furthermore, affectionally bonded individuals tend to maintain proximity and contact and become distressed when involuntary separation occurs (Cassidy, 1999). "There is, however, one criterion of attachment that is not necessarily present in other affectional bonds: the experience of security and comfort obtained from the relationship with the partner, and yet the ability to move off from the secure base provided by the partner, with confidence to engage in other activities" (Ainsworth, 1989, p. 711). Hence, in establishing whether the dog-human relationship constitutes an attachment, one must demonstrate the major elements common to all affectional bonds and in addition provide unambiguous evidence of a secure base effect. We used Ainsworth's Strange Situation procedure to test the hypothesis that the dog-human relationship constitutes an affectional bond that can be characterised as an infantile-like attachment. The Strange Situation proce- dure involves conducting controlled observations of a subject's response to being placed in an unfamiliar room, introduced to an unfamiliar adult (the stranger) and subjected to three short episodes of separation from the attach- ment figure. Although devised to test human infants, the Strange Situation procedure has also proved an effective tool for studying affectional bonds and attachment in other species (Bard, 1991; Topal et al., 1998; M.A. Shu- nik, pers. comm.). Under natural conditions, the safety of the infants of many species would be greatly compromised by even short periods of separation from specific family members, particularly the mother. Therefore, in a typical infantile</page><page sequence="4">228 PRATO-PREVIDE, CUSTANCE, SPIEZIO &amp; SABATINI system of secure attachment, all incidences of separation from the attach- ment figure (particularly in unfamiliar circumstances) would be expected to cause distress in the infant and attempts to re-establish proximity. Indeed, Ainsworth &amp; Bell (1970) defined attachment behaviour as those behaviours aimed at promoting and restoring proximity and contact such as following, approaching, vocalising, clinging and crying. Although the presence of an- other individual with whom the infant has an affectional bond (i.e. a same age play mate) may provide some comfort, the child will not usually be fully comforted or secure until she or he is reunited with the attachment figure. It is only after reunion with the attachment figure that one would expect the infant to feel sufficiently secure to engage in non-attachment related behav- iours such as exploration or play. Recently, Topal et al. (1998) used the Strange Situation procedure to ex- plore the relationship between adult dogs and humans. They used a shortened version of the test in which each episode lasted two minutes and collected a relatively small number of behavioural variables to compare the dogs' re- sponses to their owner versus a stranger. They found that the dogs explored and played more in the presence of the owner compared to the stranger. Furthermore, the dogs greeted their owners more enthusiastically than the stranger upon reunion episodes and stood by the door more when separated from their owner versus the stranger. On the basis of these findings, Topal et al. concluded that the dog-owner relationship conforms to an attachment. Although Topal et al.'s study constitutes a valuable contribution to the field, in our opinion their conclusions about the nature of the dog-human bond are somewhat premature. We believe that Topal et al.'s basic behav- ioural analyses were not sufficiently detailed to be able to distinguish attach- ment from a general affectional bond. Topal et al.'s findings clearly showed that dogs exhibit a strong preference for their owner over a stranger. How- ever, all affectional bonds involve exhibiting a preference for a specific in- dividual, a figure who is not interchangeable with anyone else (Ainsworth, 1989). To establish the presence of an attachment, one must focus much more on the behavioural categories that indicate security-, proximity- and comfort- seeking. Topal et al. collected almost no data that would indicate distress or protest during separation, such as vocalising or searching. They reported results from only one category of behaviour, standing by the door, which might indicate searching. However, a whole suite of attachment and search behaviours have been reported in children including crying, following the</page><page sequence="5">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 229 mother to the door, standing by the door, orientation to the door from a dis- tance, pounding upon the door, trying to open the door, going to the mother's empty chair or simply looking at it (Ainsworth &amp; Bell, 1970; Ainsworth et al., 1978). These behaviours convey information on the level of activation of the attachment behavioural system and on the degree to which separation causes the infants distress and activates a proximity seeking response. According to Ainsworth (1989), the secure base effect is the primary factor that distinguishes an attachment from other types of affectional bonds. Thus, the most serious omission in Topal et al.'s analysis is the lack of evidence relating to the secure base effect. The fact that the dogs played more with their owner rather than the stranger does not necessarily indicate a secure base effect. It could simply indicate a preference for the owner over the stranger. Similarly, the fact that the dogs explored more in the presence of the owner than the stranger could be due to an order effect in Ainsworth's procedure rather than a secure base effect. The dogs were left alone with the owner for the first two minutes of the procedure. By the time the stranger entered the room and particularly by the time the dogs were left alone with the stranger, they had already been given plenty of opportunity to explore the room and satisfy their curiosity. In their study, Topal et al. lumped together all the data on the dogs' behaviour in the presence of the owner versus the stranger providing little information on how a given behaviour changed from one episode to another. Such comparisons are extremely important for discerning possible order effects. The Strange Situation procedure provides three different means by which one can identify a secure base effect. First, play and exploration in human infants has been found to become depressed when they are in the presence of just the stranger and when alone, but recovers after reunion with the mother. Second, although human infants tend to explore the room and toys to a consistently high degree across the first episode of the procedure, they often cease and return immediately to their mother's side upon the entrance of the stranger. The presence of strangers is a source of some anxiety to young infants and thus the mother provide a secure base from which to view this potentially fear inducing stimulus. Third, some human infants are sufficiently confident when in the presence of their mother to engage in play with the stranger. However, when their mother leaves, without the security she provides, most infants refuse to continue playing. We investigated to what extent adult dogs exhibit similar safe base effects.</page><page sequence="6">230 PRATO-PREVIDE, CUSTANCE, SPIEZIO &amp; SABATINI The present study differed from Topal et al.'s work in a number of impor- tant respects. First, we conducted much more detailed behavioural analyses that concentrated on many of the key behavioural measures for attachment as used by Ainsworth &amp; Bell (1970) and Ainsworth et al. (1978). Second, the behaviour of the dogs in the presence of the stranger and when alone was analysed separately and, as in studies on human infants, these quali- tatively different conditions were compared. Third, the dogs' behavioural changes across episodes were evaluated. Fourth, we followed the traditional procedure used in studies on human infants, which incorporate episodes of 3-minutes duration. Finally, we included an extra phase at the end of the stan- dard Ainsworth procedure in which the owner and stranger left an article of clothing and their shoes in the room while the dog was left alone for a further three minutes. This extra episode aimed to test the degree to which the dogs would orient to their owner's objects and the degree to which they seemed to use these objects as a source of comfort. We hypothesised that if the dogs were attached to their owners, we would find evidence of secure base effects, proximity seeking and maintenance, search behaviours and comfort seeking that are functionally similar to those observed in human infants. Method Subjects Thirty-eight volunteer owner-dog pairs formed a convenience sample, recruited both by per- sonal contact and from advertisements distributed within the University of Milan. The dog owners comprised 10 men and 28 women whose ages ranged from 18 to 74 years (mean = 38.8 years, 13.5 SD). 30 owners (78.95%) had previous experience of dog ownership and 25 (65.79%) owned only one dog at the time the study took place. The sample of dogs consisted of 19 males and 19 females whose ages ranged from 1 to 10 years (mean = 4.51 years, 2.46 SD). Twenty dogs were pedigrees and 18 were mixed-breeds or 'mongrels'. Thirteen dogs (11 mongrels an 2 pure breed) had been adopted from rescue centres and their age of adoption varied from less than 3 months (3 subjects) to 3-6 months (3 subjects), 6-12 months (2 subjects), 1-4 years (5 subjects). The remaining 25 dogs had been reared in the same family home from puppy-hood and their age at acquisition ranged between 50 days and 3 months. The pedigree dogs included 2 German Shepherd Dogs, 3 Labrador Retrievers, 2 Siberian Huskies, 1 Fox Terrier, 1 Dachshund, 2 Boxers, 2 Shih Tzus, 3 Bernese Mountain Dogs, 1 Yorkshire Terrier, 1 Beagle, 1 German Wirehaired Pointer, and 1 Italian Hunting Hound. All the dogs were kept exclusively for companionship and lived within the human house- hold. None of the dogs were working dogs, guard dogs or highly trained beyond basic obedi- ence. All the dogs were accustomed to being taken out of doors with their owner and encoun- tering human strangers. As far as their owners were aware, none of the dogs had ever shown</page><page sequence="7">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 231 aggression towards a human. All the owners reported that their dogs were used to staying alone at home and could remain alone without problems. Experimental setting and materials The dogs were tested in a standardised and controlled 'strange' environment, as similar as possible to that described by Ainsworth &amp; Bell (1970). Figure 1 is an aerial plan of the unfamiliar environment. It comprised a relatively bare room (3.00 x 5.30 m) at the Institute of Psychology of the University of Milan. The room was equipped with two chairs (one labelled as 'stranger' and the other as 'owner'), a selection of dog toys (one large and one small ball, a plastic bottle, a rope pull-toy, and a squeaky toy), a water bowl and two videocameras (Sony Handycam Video HI 8). One of the two videocameras was connected with a monitor positioned in an adjacent room, so that each session could be independently observed. To minimise extraneous noise, testing was conducted each weekend between 1430 and 1830 hours, over a period of three months. Procedure Pre-experimental phase (approximately 10 minutes in duration): The owner and dog were met and escorted to a waiting room. The procedure was briefly described to the owner and the owner was asked to fill in a questionnaire providing background information on his or her dog. The specific goal of the study was not disclosed at this stage. Instead, the owner was told that the aim of the study was to investigate the exploratory behaviour of dogs in an unfamiliar environment. After gaining the owner's permission to videorecord behaviour during the experimental phase, the two video cameras were activated and both the dog and owner were led to the experimental room. |carnera 1 bowl | * ownerl- toys 3.00 Iv~~~~ stranger door Fig. 1.

The procedure lasted approximately 27 minutes and consisted of an introductory episode followed by 8 three-minute experimental episodes (Fig. 2, episodes 1-8). The intro- ductory episode and the first seven experimental episodes were those typical of the Strange Situation. An additional eighth episode was included to study the dogs' response to the pres- ence of objects or articles of clothing left behind by the stranger or owner. The episodes were as follows: Introductory episode: Owner, Dog and Experimenter (approximately 30 s). The owner was guided to his or her chair, and asked to sit and complete the questionnaire. The experimenter took the dog's lead and left the room. Episode 1: Owner and Dog (3 min). The owner sat quietly filling in the questionnaire and, as instructed, only interacted with the dog (i.e. by petting or talking to it) if it specifically sought attention. The dog was free to explore the room. Episode 2: Owner, Dog and Stranger (3 min). The stranger, who was always played by the same woman and who had never met the dog before, entered the room and sat quietly for 1 minute. She conversed with the owner for the second minute, and then during the third minute she approached the dog and attempted to stimulate play by throwing a ball or offering a pull-toy. At the end of this episode the owner left the room unobtrusively. Episode 3: Stranger and Dog (3 min, 1st separation episode). The stranger continued to play with the dog if it was willing; if it was inactive or distressed, the stranger attempted to distract it with play or by providing verbal and tactile comfort. Episode 4: Owner and Dog (3 min, 1st reunion episode). The owner entered the room, paused momentarily after opening the door to allow the dog to initiate interaction and then, as instructed, greeted and/or comforted the dog in the same manner as after returning from work or shopping. The stranger quietly exited the room as soon as she was confident that she would cause the least possible disruption to the dog and owner's reunion. The owner had been told that she or he was free to play with the dog throughout the episode. At the end of the 3 minutes, a telephone in the room rang on a low volume alerting the owner to leave the room with a verbal farewell. Episode 5: Dog alone (3 min, 2nd separation episode). The dog was left alone for three minutes, but was constantly observed by the owner and researchers on the monitor in the adjacent room. The owner was instructed to remain silent throughout this period, but retained the right to terminate the episode if she or he believed the dog was becoming too distressed (none of the owners felt the need to execute this right). Episode 6: Stranger and Dog (3 min, 3rd separation episode). The stranger entered the room paused momentarily after opening the door to allow the dog to initiate interaction and greeted the dog if it was willing by petting its head and back. She then followed the same protocol as in episode 3. Toward the end of the episode, the stranger removed her shoes and placed them near her chair, and also left an article of clothing (equivalent to the article selected by the owner) on the chair before leaving. Episode 7: Owner and Dog (3 min, 2nd reunion). The owner entered the room, paused momentarily after opening the door, then greeted the dog as though he or she had just returned from work or shopping. The stranger left the room unobtrusively. At the end of third minute, the telephone rang again alerting the owner to remove his or her shoes and to place them near his or her chair and to leave an article of clothing (such as a scarf) on the chair before exiting the room with a verbal farewell.</page><page sequence="9">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 233 Episode 1: Owner and Dog Episode 2: Owner, Dog and Stranger ... .. ..

The dog was left alone and monitored as in episode 5. At the end of the third minute, the owner returned and greeted and/or comforted the dog until the experimenter arrived and officially terminated the procedure. Immediately after each session, the experimental room, water bowl and toys were washed using a non-toxic, weakly scented disinfectant. Data collection and analysis The behaviour of each dog during the experimental episodes (ep. 1-8) was recorded on videotapes and each session was analysed by two trained observers recording a total of 17 behavioural categories. These categories were selected after a preliminary analysis of the videotapes and on the basis of previous work based on the strange situation procedure (i.e. Ainsworth &amp; Bell, 1970; Ainsworth et al., 1978; Topal et al., 1998). The dogs' behaviour during each episode was first scored using 5-second point sampling (instantaneous sampling). This method of time sampling was chosen because it is a way of condensing information, thereby making it possible to record several different categories of behaviour simultaneously and with accuracy when the exact duration of a given behaviour is not strictly necessary. If the sample interval is short enough, point sampling is accurate in estimating duration of behavioural states and gives a good approximation of the proportion of time spent performing a behaviour pattem. However, instantaneous point sampling is not suitable for recording discrete events of short duration and rare behaviour patterns. There- fore, in a second round of coding we used continuous recording to collect frequencies for a number of discrete events. Table 1 contains a list of the different behavioural categories, their definitions and the type of sampling method employed for data collection. The greeting behaviour of the dogs towards the owner (ep. 4 and 7) and the stranger (ep. 2 and 6) was recorded both quantitatively (duration of greeting in seconds before the resumption of another behaviour) and qualitatively (in terms of an intensity score) considering the first minute of each reunion episode. The greeting intensity score was as follows: if no greeting behaviour occurred, the score was 0 (no greeting); if the dog initiated approach, but</page><page sequence="12">236 PRATO-PREVIDE, CUSTANCE, SPIEZIO &amp; SABATINI then showed a mild greeting with limited physical contact and tail wagging, the score was 1 (mild greeting); if physical contact was full and the greeting behaviour was intense (i.e. jumping up on the owner, vocalising and strongly wagging the tail) the score was 2 (intense greeting). Interobserver reliability was assessed by means of independent parallel coding of a ran- dom sample of 4 videotaped sessions (i.e. 10% of the total number of dogs) using percentage agreement: agreement on frequencies and greeting behaviour was evaluated separately. Per- centage agreement was always more than 96%. Since, histograms revealed that the majority of the data were not normally distributed, all statistical tests were non-parametric and two- tailed. Results The results presented reflect average tendencies rather than individual differ- ences. There were clear individual differences among the dogs, but a detailed exposition of these is not within the scope of the present paper. Since, there was a relatively small sample of dogs, subjects with extreme experiences had the potential to skew the overall results. Hence, the analyses were carried out using non-parametric tests based on the median rather than the mean, which tends to minimise this kind of distortion. The results have been arranged into four categories: secure base effects, proximity seeking, search behaviours and comfort seeking. D refers to dog, S to stranger and 0 to owner. Secure base effects Exploration According to the ethological approach, an attachment figure functions as a secure base and thereby allows the child to move off and engage in other behaviour, especially exploration. Figure 3 shows how exploratory behaviour varied in successive episodes. Exploration declined sharply from episode 1 when the dog was alone with the owner to episode 2 when also the stranger was present (Wilcoxon test: z = 4.28, p &amp;lt; 0.0001) remaining low in episode 3, when the dog was alone with the stranger, and in the following episodes. A comparison between the overall proportion of sample points spent exploring in episodes characterised by owner (0) presence (1, 4, 7), stranger (S) presence (3, 6) or by isolation (D; 5, 8) revealed a significant difference across these situations (Friedman test: O+D vs S+D vs D, x2 = 32.42, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Overall, the dogs explored more in the presence of their</page><page sequence="13">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 237 Exploration-Passive behavior (N = 38) 1.0 .0 0 o 1- c .o o o n u.Y 0.8 0.7 u.

However, it is possible that these differences in exploration were due to an order effect of diminishing curiosity over time rather than to a secure base effect. When the dogs were first introduced to the room, they were in the presence of their owner and the most intense exploration occurred in the first minute. Although there was a significant difference in the amount of exploration between the third minute of episode 1 and the first minute of episode 2 (Wilcoxon test: z = 2.25, p = 0.025), there was also a significant difference between the first and second minute (Wilcoxon test: z = 2.49, p = 0.012) and a decrease between the second and third minute (Wilcoxon test: z = 1.919, p = 0.055) of episode one. Figure 4 clearly indicates that exploration rapidly and steadily declined across the first four minutes of the procedure. Overall males (N = 19) were slightly more explorative than females (N = 19) and in particular engaged in exploratory behaviour signifi- cantly more during the first episode (Mann-Whitney test: ep. 1, z = 2.250, p = 0.024). No differences in exploration were found comparing abandoned (N = 13) and non-abandoned (N = 25) dogs. </page><page sequence="14">PRATO-PREVIDE, CUSTANCE, SPIEZIO &amp; SABATINI Exploration (N=38) 1.0 A a . 0.8 . 0.7 X. 0.6 E 0.5 o 0 4-- - 0.0 0.3 t 0.2 0 0 0.1 a. 0.0 .

Response to stranger's entrance Only 7 out of 38 dogs (18,4%) remained close to their owner or returned to their owner's side on the entrance of the stranger, observing her from a distance. Most of the dogs (81,6%) did not seem at all wary of the stranger: a number of them greeted her or approached her, others ignored her continuing the activities they were engaged in. Passive behaviour If the owner operated as a secure base, this might have allowed the dogs to feel sufficiently calm to engage in passive behaviour when in their owner's presence. Passive behaviour (i.e. sitting, standing or lying down without ob- viously focussing on some aspect of the environment) was higher in episode 1 and 2 and when the dogs were alone (ep. 5, 8; Fig. 3). During episodes 1 and 2 the subjects tended to stay close to the owner, whereas during episodes 5 and 8 most passive behaviour occurred in the door area. Comparison be- tween the overall proportion of sample points spent passive in the episodes characterised by owner presence (1, 4, 7), stranger presence (3, 6) or by iso- lation (5, 8) revealed significant differences (Friedman test: O+D vs S+D vs D, X2 = 6.77, p = 0.034). Dogs were more passive with their owner and when alone than with the stranger (SNK test for multiple comparisons: O+D vs S+D, p &lt; 0.05; D vs S+D, p &lt; 0.05; O+D vs D, p = NS).

No differences in passive behaviour were found comparing abandoned (N = 13) and non-abandoned (N = 25) dogs. Dur- ing isolation episodes non-abandoned dogs tended to stay more passive than abandoned ones (Mann-Whitney test: ep. 5-8, z = 1.879, p = 0.06). Play Individual play occurred rarely: only 4 out of 38 subjects (10.5%) played with toys in episodes 1 and 2, and 1 subject did so when left alone in episode 5. In episode 2.66% of the subject accepted to play with the stranger, whereas only 55.3% played, at least to some extent, in episode 3, and 39.5% did so in episode 6. A comparison between the proportion of sample points spent playing with the stranger in episodes 2 (last minute) and 3 showed that play decreased after the owner left the room (Wilcoxon test: ep. 2 vs ep. 3, z = 2.072, p = 0.038). Figure 5 shows the proportion of sample points spent by the dogs playing with the owner (ep. 4 and 7) and with the stranger (ep. 3 and 6): a comparison between the overall proportion of sample points spent playing with the owner and the stranger in these episodes showed that dogs played significantly more with their owner (Wilcoxon test: O+D vs S+D, z = 2.08, p = 0.037). Social play with the owner clearly decreased on the second reunion episode (Wilcoxon test: ep. 4 vs ep. 7, Social play (N = 38) 0 0,9- . 0,8- 0 co 0,7 - 0 E 0,6- 0,5- 0. 0,2 0 0,3 LI.Ui Ep 3 Ep 4 Ep 6 Ep 7 S+D O+D S+D O+D Experimental episodes Fig. 5.

We found no sex differences in play behaviour with the owner (ep. 4 and 7) and the stranger (ep. 3 and 6), whereas abandoned dogs played less than non- abandoned ones with the stranger (Mann-Whitney test: ep. 3-6, z = 1. 967, p = 0.049). Proximity seeking Approach The dogs approached both the owner and the stranger in the different episodes both spontaneously and when called. In episode 2 the stranger was approached more than the owner (Wilcoxon test: z = 2.44, p = 0.014); however, a comparison between episodes 4 and 7 (presence of the owner) and 3 and 6 (presence of the stranger) showed that the dogs approached their owner significantly more than the stranger (Wilcoxon test: z = 2.341, p = 0.02). While approach behaviour toward the owner was comparable on episodes 4 and 7, approach behaviour toward the stranger increased remark- ably in episode 6 (Wilcoxon test: ep. 3 vs ep. 6, z = 3.071, p = 0.002). Withdraw Of course, withdraw or avoidance is the antithesis of proximity seeking. It is included here to offer a direct contrast to approach. None of the dogs clearly avoided interaction with its owner whereas 3 subjects (2 of them abandoned) showed strong avoidance of the stranger especially during episodes 3 and 6. Avoidance responses occurred when the stranger tried to interact with the dog or to comfort him/her and varied in intensity from looking away to turning away to moving away while staring at the stranger. Oriented to person Orientation to a person may have different functions, one of which could be monitoring proximity. The dogs paid attention to both the owner and stranger. In episode 2, their attention was focused significantly more on the stranger (Wilcoxon test: z = 4.285, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). A comparison be- tween episodes 4 and 7 (presence of the owner) and 3 and 6 (presence of the stranger) showed that they spent more time oriented to their owner (Wilcoxon test: O+D vs S+D, z = 2.98, p = 0.003).</page><page sequence="17">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 241 Following Following the owner to the door was scored for episodes 2, 4 and 7 when the owner left the room. Most of the dogs (86.8%) followed their owner to the door at some point during the procedure, and only 5 subjects (13.2%) never showed following behaviour. In particular, 36.8% of the dogs followed their owner to the door all three times that she or he exited the room, 28.9 % followed on two occasions and 21. 1% only one time. On the contrary only 4 dogs (10.5%) followed the stranger to the door when she left and did it only one time. Vocalising It has been suggested that vocalising might function to promote proximity maintenance or resumption, in addtion to indicating distress. The majority of the dogs (86.8%) vocalised during the strange situation although to a different extent. Figure 6 reports the mean number of vocalisation bouts (barking, howling and whining) in successive episodes; vocal behaviour was low in the episodes characterised by the presence of the owner (1, 4, 7) increasing during separation episodes (3, 6 and 5, 8). Vocalisations increased when the owner left the room and the dogs remained alone with the stranger (Wilcoxon test: ep. 2 vs ep. 3: z = 2.046, p = 0.04).

Vocalisations increased significantly during social isolation (ep. 5, 8) but not significantly in the presence of the stranger (ep. 3, 6: SNK test for multiple comparisons: O+D vs S+D, p = NS; O+D vs D, p &amp;lt; 0.05; D+S vs D, p &amp;lt; 0.05). Dogs vocalised significantly less on the second isolation episode (ep. 8) when they remained alone in the presence of objects (Wilcoxon test: z = 2.55, p = 0.01). Search behaviours Scratch door 24 out of 38 dogs (63.2%) scratched the door and jumped on it during separa- tion episodes. This behaviour occurred mainly when the dogs remained alone (ep. 3, 6: 36.3% of scratching bouts; ep. 5, 8: 61.6% of scratching bouts). A comparison between the two separation conditions (ep. 3, 6 and 5, 8) showed that the number of scratching bouts increased significantly during social iso- lation (Wilcoxon test: S+D vs D, z = 2.170, p = 0.03); it decreased the second time the dogs remained with the stranger or alone (Wilcoxon test: ep. 3 vs ep. 6: z = 2.654, p = 0.008; ep. 5 vs ep. 8: z = 2.825, p = 0.005). Oriented to door Oriented to the door was interpreted as search behaviour by Ainsworth et al. (1978). As shown in Fig. 7, this behaviour varied in successive episodes, increasing dramatically during the separation episodes (ep. 3, 5, 6, 8). The overall proportion of sample points spent staring at the door in episodes characterised by owner presence (1, 4, 7), stranger presence (3, 6) or by isolation (5, 8) differed remarkably (Friedman test: O+D vs S+D vs D, x2 = 64.225, p &amp;lt; 0.0001); the dogs' attention was oriented towards the door far more when the owner was absent or the dog was alone in the room (SNK test for multiple comparisons: O+D vs S+D, p &amp;lt; 0.05; O+D vs D, p &amp;lt; 0.05; S+D vs D, p &amp;lt; 0.05). This behaviour increased sharply from episode 2 to episode 3 when the owner left the room (Wilcoxon test: ep. 2 vs ep. 3: z = 4.816, p &amp;lt; 0.0001); the dogs remained more oriented towards the door on the second encounter with the stranger (Wilcoxon test: ep. 3 vs ep. 6: z = 2.286, p = 0.022) but stared at the door less on the second isolation episode (Wilcoxon test: ep. 5 vs ep. 8: z = 2.241, p = 0.025).</page><page sequence="19">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 243 Oriented to door (N = 38) 1,0 cn0,9 0,8 0. e 0,7- E 0,6- co, a0,5 0 E 0,4 - 0 0 CL 0,2- 0. 0,1 Epl Ep 2 Ep 3 Ep 4 Ep 5 Ep 6 Ep 7 Ep 8 O+D O+D+S S+D O+D D S+D O+D D+obj Experimental episodes Fig. 7.

Abandoned dogs were not more oriented to the door than non-abandoned during isolation (ep. 5, 8) but tended to stare at the door more in the presence of the stranger and in particular in episode 3 when their owner left the room for the first time (Mann-Whitney test: ep. 3, z = 1.917, p = 0.055). Oriented to chair As Fig. 8 shows the dogs glanced at both the owner's and stranger's empty chairs during the different separation episodes; however, they were signifi- cantly more oriented to their owner's chair (Wilcoxon test: ep. 3, 6, Owner vs Stranger, z = 2.084, p = 0.037; ep. 5, 8, Owner vs Stranger, z = 2.926, p = 0.003). Glancing at the owner's chair occurred almost exclusively when the owner was absent (95.5% of all occurrences) and was significantly higher when the dogs were alone in the room (Wilcoxon test: S+D vs D, z = 3.60, p = 0.0003); this behaviour decreased the second time they remained with the stranger (ep. 3 vs ep. 6: z = 3.353, p = 0.0008) and increased sig- nificantly the second time they remained alone with objects (Wilcoxon test: z - 2.10, p = 0.035).</page><page sequence="20">244 PRATO-PREVIDE, CUSTANCE, SPIEZIO &amp; SABATINI Oriented to chair-Physical contact with chair (N = 38) 100 - 90 80- 7 0- c60 -.000 &gt; Docs 0)5 50- 30- 20- 10 0 Ep 3-6 Ep 5-8 Fig. 8.

Comfort seeking Physical contact with chair The dogs made contact with both the owner's and stranger's empty chairs during the different episodes; however, when in the presence of the stranger (ep. 3, 6) and when alone (ep. 5, 8) they were significantly more in contact with their owner's chair (Wilcoxon test: ep. 3, 6, Owner vs Stranger, z = 3.354, p = 0.0008; ep. 5, 8, Owner vs Stranger, z = 2.481, p = 0.013; Fig. 8). Three different types of contact with the chair were observed: putting the head on the chair and sniffing it for a while, sitting or lying down with the body in contact with the chair legs, and climbing on the chair remaining seated on it: these last two type of contact were almost exclusively with the owner's chair. Contact with objects 71% of the dogs made contact with the objects (shoes and piece of clothing) during episode 8 and mainly with those of the owner (65.2% of all contacts). A comparison between the number of contacts with owner's and stranger's objects showed that the dogs made significantly more contacts with the ob- jects left by their owner (Wilcoxon test: z = 2.267, p = 0.023). Contact</page><page sequence="21">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 245 with objects ranged from sniffing them to maintaining physical contact with them (i.e. sitting on the clothes on the owner's chair): physical contact was directed to only the owner's objects. Furthermore, a comparison between the proportion of sample points spent by the dogs in the owner's area (Area 3, see Fig. 1) during social isolation (ep. 5 and 8) showed that the amount of time spent next to the owner's chair increased significantly when the owner's object were present (Wilcoxon test: ep. 5 vs ep. 8, z = 3.026, p = 0.002). Physical contact with person The dogs sought and maintained physical contact with both the owner and the stranger during the different episodes. However, a comparison between the proportion of sample points spent in physical contact with the owner (ep. 1, 4, 7) and with the stranger (ep. 3, 6) showed that the dogs spent more time in contact with their owner (Wilcoxon test: z = 2.31, p = 0.02 1). During separation episodes the dogs, although to a different extent, accepted to stay in physical contact with the stranger and to be petted: physical contact was significantly higher in episode 6 (Wilcoxon test: ep. 3 vs ep. 6, z = 4.424, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). However, when in contact with the stranger they were much more oriented to the door than when in contact with their owner (Wilcoxon test: ep. 3, 6 vs ep. 4, 7, z = 4.259, p &amp;lt; 0.0001). Greeting Greeting behaviour was scored during the first minute of episodes 2 and 6 (entrance of the stranger) and 4 and 7 (reunion with the owner). Only 2 out of 38 subjects showed no greeting towards both the owner and the stranger, 7 subjects (18.4%) never greeted the stranger and 29 (76.3%) greeted, at least to some extent, both the owner and the stranger. Dogs showed consid- erably more intense levels of greeting towards the entering owner compared with the stranger. As Fig. 9 shows, differences in overall greeting duration towards the owner (ep. 4, 7) and the stranger (ep. 2, 6) were highly signif- icant (Wilcoxon test: z = 2.99, p = 0.002) and the duration of greeting behaviour did not decrease on the second reunion with the owner (Wilcoxon test: ep. 4 vs ep. 7, p = NS) and on the second encounter with the stranger (Wilcoxon test: ep. 2 vs ep. 6, p = NS). Greeting towards the owner was also more intense: most subjects showed no greeting (36.8%) or mild greet- ing (50%) when the stranger entered the first time, whereas the majority</page><page sequence="22">246 PRATO-PREVIDE, CUSTANCE, SPIEZIO &amp; SABATINI Greeting behaviour (N = 38) 12,00 (/) +1 C 8 ,0 0 ..... ............................. .....

(60.5%) showed intense greeting on the first reunion with the owner. Sim- ilarly, after being left completely alone in episode 5, and even though the stranger entered first (ep. 6), the dogs still showed more intense greetings towards their owner when she or he returned three minutes later at the start of episode 7 (Sign test: p &amp;lt; 0.05). Differences in greeting intensity were assessed comparing the scores of each dog during episodes 2 and 4 (first en- counter) and episodes 6 and 7 (second encounter). In both cases, greetings towards the owner were significantly more intense (Sign test: p &amp;lt; 0.05). Discussion The aim of this study was to investigate in some detail the nature of the dog- human social relationship by observing owner-dog pairs under controlled conditions using a modified version of the strange situation procedure devel- oped by Mary Ainsworth. This procedure seemed particularly suitable for testing dogs as it reproduces situations that dogs are likely to encounter in their everyday life, such as being in a new environment, meeting a stranger, and being separated from their owner for short periods. Overall, our findings clearly indicate that the dog-human relationship is a strong affectional bond, but they provide only rather limited evidence that it constitutes an attach- ment.</page><page sequence="23">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 247 Ainsworth (1989) stated that the secure base effect was a primary factor in identifying an attachment bond. Three measures of the secure base effect have been identified: (1) play and exploration become depressed when in the presence of just the stranger and when alone, but recover after reunion with the mother; (2) infant cease playing or exploring on the entrance of the stranger and return to their mother's side; and (3) infants will sometimes play with the stranger in their mother's presence, but not her absence. In our study there was an insufficient amount of individual play in the dogs to use this as a measure of the secure base effect. In addition, only 18.4% of the dogs remained close to their owner or returned to their owner's side on the entrance of the stranger. Most of the dogs did not seem at all wary of the stranger and hence her presence did not appear to activate the attachment system. The dogs' exploratory behaviours consisted mainly of locomotory ex- ploration. Other forms of exploration reported in human infants and chim- panzees were either rare (i.e. visual) or physically difficult for dogs to per- form (i.e. manipulatory). Exploration was higher in the presence of the owner (see also Topal et al., 1998). Moreover, similar to what is reported for human infants and hand-reared chimpanzees (Ainsworth &amp; Bell, 1970; Ainsworth et al., 1978; Bard, 1991), exploration occurred mainly in episode 1, when the dogs were with their owner, and a significant decline was observed from episode 1 to episode 2 with the entrance of the stranger. At first glance, the above pattern of results suggests that the owner pro- vided a secure base for exploration and that the entrance of the stranger neg- atively affected exploratory behaviour, indicating stranger's wariness or fear. However, by the end of the third minute of episode 1 most of the dogs had either finished exploring the room or were doing so to a much lesser extent than before. In addition to there being a significant difference between the last minute of episode 1 and the first minute of episode 2, there was also a significant decline in exploration across the whole of the first episode. Thus the overall profile of exploration during the first five minutes of the procedure suggests that these differences could be due to an order effect of reduced cu- riosity over time. Therefore, the dogs' exploratory behaviour did not supply convincing evidence of a secure base effect. In accordance with Topal et al.'s results, our sample of dogs engaged in social play significantly more in the presence of the owner. However, as with exploration, this finding does not necessarily indicate a secure base effect.</page><page sequence="24">248 PRATO-PREVIDE, CUSTANCE, SPIEZIO &amp; SABATINI Instead, it might suggest that the owner was a preferred playmate. If the dogs had engaged in individual play more in the presence of the owner rather than the stranger, there would have been better evidence of a secure base effect. However, very few dogs engaged in individual play of any kind, whether with or without their owner. Rather more indicative of a secure base effect was the finding that the proportion of social play with the stranger was higher in the presence of the owner (i.e. during the last minute of episode 2) than when the dogs were left alone with the stranger in episode 3. This finding suggests that in episode 2 the presence of the owner provided a sufficient sense of security to promote play with the stranger. Although this decrease of play in the absence of the owner might be partly due to fatigue or reduced interest, the overall behaviour of the dogs during episode 2 and 3 suggests that in episode 3 the attachment behavioural system was activated and interfered with play: in particular, play became discontinuous and a variety of behaviours indicating distress, protest and searching appeared (i.e. vocalising, running to the door or looking at it continuously). Play behaviour with the owner was intense again in episode 4, thus suggesting that the decrease in play in the absence of the owner in episode 3 and the differences in the propensity to play with the owner versus the stranger were unlikely to be due to fatigue or satiation. In general the dogs showed little distress in the pre-separation episodes. In fact, some of them were so deeply engrossed in play with the stranger in the last minute of episode 2 that they did not even notice their owner leaving the room. However, once they did notice their owner's absence, most dogs showed distress and protest during separation and engaged in a variety of behaviours indicating that they were searching for the absent owner either actively or by orienting to the last place in which she or he was seen. Our observations during separation episodes (ep. 3, 6, 5 and 8) show that the dogs' search behaviours closely resembled those described in human infants and chimpanzees and included following the owner to the door, scratching at and jumping up on the door, pulling on the door handle with the forelegs or mouth, remaining oriented to the door, going to the owner's empty chair or looking at it from a distance. Both human infants and chimpanzees have been reported to show alarm and distress in terms of crying during separation episodes. In the presence of the owner (ep. 1, 4 and 7), and when both the owner and the stranger were in the room (ep. 2) the dogs' vocal behaviour was limited and consisted</page><page sequence="25">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 249 mainly of attention seeking, play soliciting and greeting vocalisations. In contrast, during separation episodes whining and barking increased, reaching the highest levels during social isolation (ep. 5 and 8). Vocal behaviour was especially activated by being left alone and was reduced by the presence of the stranger. This suggests that for dogs separation from the owner in an unfamiliar environment was distressing, but not as distressing as being left completely alone. The decline of vocal behaviour in episode 6, together with the increase of physical contact with the stranger suggests that, in general, the dogs did not find the stranger frightening per se and she was able to provide some comfort. Nevertheless, a number of dogs continued to whine even when in physical contact with the stranger. Some accepted petting, but remained oriented to the door most of the time, others did not vocalise but showed an increase in search behaviours such as going to the owner's chair or looking at it. Therefore, the friendly stranger was not able to provide sufficient comfort to curtail search and protest behaviours during the owner's absence. The continuation of distress and search behaviour by the dogs when they were left alone with the stranger, but not the owner, is consistent with the pattern of attachment behaviours described by Ainsworth &amp; Bell (1970) in human infants. Separation from the owner promoted proximity and contact seeking be- haviour upon reunion (ep. 4 and 7). During reunion with the owner, prox- imity seeking behaviour included greeting responses, approaching, and fol- lowing the owner around the room. Greeting toward the entering owner was significantly different from greeting toward the entering stranger in terms of duration and quality and the stranger was approached significantly less in comparison to the owner. Avoidance or withdrawal behaviour was seldomly exhibited by the dogs. In fact, it was recorded in only three dogs (all of whom had been abandoned at some time in their life) and only in response to the stranger. Human infants exhibit resistant behaviours, in which they resist being picked up or held and struggle to be put down again. None of the owners attempted to pick up their dogs and nothing that could be characterised as resistance was observed. Although the dogs visually oriented to both the owner and the stranger, overall they spent more time oriented towards their owner. Frequency of looking at the owner and stranger was probably influenced by a number of factors and may have served different functions. Dogs are known to engage</page><page sequence="26">250 PRATO-PREVIDE, CUSTANCE, SPIEZIO &amp; SABATINI in mutual eye contact with their owners and spend considerable time observ- ing their movements, an activity which according to Serpell (1986) plays a central role in building and maintaining the relationship between people and their pets. Prior to separation (ep. 1 and 2), most dogs looked at their owner only occasionally. In episode 2, their attention was clearly captured by the stranger: this appeared to be due to a variable combination of curiosity, ex- ploration, wariness and sociability. All dogs looked at the entering stranger, but not all approached, sniffed or greeted her. A number of subjects observed the stranger from a distance remaining close to their owner's chair without interacting or playing with her. This finding is consistent with what reported in both human infants and chimpanzees. Visual orientation toward the owner increased significantly during reunion episodes and occurred frequently dur- ing physical contact. In contrast, visual orientation toward the stranger (ep. 3 and 6) occurred mainly during play or in response to the stranger's at- tempts to interact. These differences in the use of visual orientation suggest that looking at the stranger was related to socialisation toward humans in general, whereas looking at the owner was related to affection and comfort seeking. The behaviour of the dogs during the last episode, when they remained alone in the presence of the owner's and stranger's objects, suggests that at least a number of the dogs used the owner's objects as a source of comfort. The dogs showed a clear preference for their owner's objects: there were significantly more contacts with the owners' objects and prolonged physical contact was only ever directed to the owner's objects. Behaviour in episode 8 differed from that of episode 5 in a number of ways. First, barking, whining and scratching at the door decreased significantly. Second, the time spent ori- ented to the door decreased while the time spent oriented to the owner's chair increased significantly. Last but not least, the amount of time spent by the dogs in the owner's chair area where the owner's objects were increased sig- nificantly. In fact, during episode 8 a number of dogs jumped on the owner's chair and sat on the clothes while others remained next to their owner's chair sitting or lying down. Although potentially confounding order effects can- not be excluded, the significant increase in the amount of time spent close to the owner's chair in episode 8 suggests that the owner's clothing could have represented a source of comfort. As dogs strongly rely on olfaction and are reported to prefer familiar odours (Millott, 1994) it is possible that they</page><page sequence="27">DOG-HUMAN ATTACHMENT 251 used the owner's clothing as a source of comfort because it carried famil- iar odours. It is also possible that previous experience during the procedure could have decreased distress (i.e. by promoting the expectation in the dogs of their owner's return) and this could have lead to a decrease in searching and proximity seeking behaviours and a corresponding increase in passive behaviours. In summary, we found that adult dogs' behaviour in the Strange Situation test resembled that of human and chimpanzee infants to a remarkable degree. Our results clearly indicate that the dog-human relationship is an affectional bond, but our evidence that it conforms to an attachment is not entirely conclusive. The order effects inherent in Ainsworth's procedure meant that we could find only one positive indicator of the secure base effect, namely, the fact that the dogs would play with the stranger in the presence of the owner, but not in his or her absence. This suggests that the conclusions drawn in the previous study by Topal et al. were premature and that further research is needed to gain a better understanding of the nature of the dog-human bond and to test specifically for secure base effects. Modified versions of the procedure could be devised to test specific hypotheses avoiding the order effects typical of Ainsworth's original design. Nevertheless, the Strange Situation procedure and possible modified ver- sions aimed at counteracting order effects would appear to be an appropriate and useful tool to test hypotheses about the bond between dogs and their owners and to evaluate the quality of the relationship. In fact, in terms of the dog-human affectional bond and attachment, there are very many areas of possible future research. With a larger sample size than that used here, one could compare different breeds of dogs and the effect of gender with respect to the dogs and their owners. Even with our relatively small sample, our data show males dogs spent more time exploring the new environment than females during the first episode, whereas female were significantly more passive. One could also investigate the effect of early socialisation with humans and previous experiences on the dog-human bond. A rather dramatic experi- ence that can have a profound influence on dog-human relationship is aban- donment, especially if it takes place when the affectional bond is already well established. Thirteen of the dogs in our sample had been abandoned at some point in their life before being adopted by their present owner. We</page><page sequence="28">252 PRATO-PREVIDE, CUSTANCE, SPIEZIO &amp; SABATINI found several trends (although most were statistically non-significant) sug- gesting that these dogs were more anxious and perhaps less securely bonded: they explored and played less in the presence of the owner, were less passive when left alone and withdrew from the stranger more than those dogs that had lived in the same household since puppyhood. A particularly interesting finding, that deserves further attention, is the significant difference in social play with the stranger between abandoned and non-abandoned dogs. Physiological measures could be used to support the behavioural data with respect to anxiety, distress and comfort seeking (Palestrini et al., 2001). None of the owners in our study reported that their dogs suffered any serious be- havioural problems, and almost all reported that their dogs could stay alone at home without problems, however during the test a number of dogs showed behaviours that could be related to separation anxiety (Voith &amp; Borchelt, 1985). The Strange Situation could be used to investigate the behaviour of dogs that exhibit 'separation anxiety' and to make comparisons with dogs not showing this behaviour problem.
