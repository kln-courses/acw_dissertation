MUSICK, Duke University Abstract For many years, social scientists have reported that southerners express lower levels of tolerance vis-ai-vis unpopular groups than nonsoutherners. Some researchers have suggested that these widely observed regional variations are due to the prominence of fundamentalist Protestantism in the South. In analyses of data from the 1988 General Social Survey, however, this hypothesis receives only partial support. Substantial regional differences in tolerance of left-wing groups, including communists, atheists, and homosexuals, persist despite controls for a range of religious variables. We suggest that future research on regional differences in public attitudes should consider contextual as well as individual religiousfactors. The willingness of American citizens to extend civil liberties to various unpopular groups has long been a topic of interest to social scientists. The recent resurgence of social science research on tolerance (Bollinger 1986; Corbett 1982; McClosky &amp; Zaller 1984) dovetails with the sharpening cultural polariza- tion of U.S. society after the mid-1970s (Hunter 1991). For roughly four decades, studies have consistently shown that southemers are more reluctant to extend civil liberties to unpopular groups than are residents of other regions (Abrahamson &amp; Carter 1986; Middleton 1976; Nunn, Crockett &amp; Williams 1978; Stouffer 1955; Tuch 1987; Wilson 1986). While this low level of tolerance partly reflects regional variations in rurality, education, and other factors, strong evidence of regional differences in tolerance persists even with statistical adjustments for these covariates. Further, despite earlier predictions that migration and economic development would gradually attenuate southern attitudinal distinctiveness (e.g., Key 1949), trend analyses indicate that regional variations in tolerance have remained relatively constant over time (Abrahamson &amp; Carter 1986). * The authors thank Norval Glenn and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on earlier drafts and Sharon Sandomirsky for assistance with data management.

(Nunn, Crockett &amp; Williams 1978:105) To date, however, few researchers have attempted to explain the phenomenon of southern intolerance.' One promising exception to this general pattern of neglect is a brief analysis by Jelen (1982), who attributes the low levels of tolerance among southerners to the prevalence of fundamentalist Protestantism in the South. Though his analyses of data from the General Social Surveys offer tentative support for that hypothesis, Jelen emphasizes that his findings are "extremely tentative and speculative" (81). His study is characterized by several limitations, including (1) reliance on a single religious indicator, namely fundamentalist denominational preference; (2) failure to measure tolerance toward a range of ideologically diverse target groups; and (3) inadequate statistical controls for the potentially confounding effects of a number of background factors that are associated with region, tolerance, and/or religion. After briefly summarizing the social science literature on the southern religious environment and the prominence of fundamentalist Protestantism,2 we discuss the implications of conservative theological beliefs, religious practices, and fundamentalist organizational cultures for (in)tolerance. Using data from the 1988 General Social Survey, we then test the hypothesis that low levels of southern tolerance reflect the influence of fundamentalism. In contrast to Jelen (1982), we find only very mixed support for this hypothesis. We conclude by suggesting several directions for further research on southern attitudinal distinctiveness. Theoretical and Empirical Background REGION AND RELIGION Numerous observers over the years have called attention to the centrality of religious values and institutions in the lives of southerners (e.g., Fichter &amp; Maddox 1965). For instance, contemporary survey data consistently report higher levels of personal piety (e.g., prayer, Bible study) and institutional religious participation (e.g., church membership, attendance) among southerners than among residents of other regions (e.g., Roof &amp; McKinney 1987). Ample anecdotal evidence indicates that southerners often place particular emphasis on church membership, viewing it as an emblem of personal legitimacy and a testimony to one's moral character and goodwill. Moreover, religion has long been one of the key features by which distinctive regional cultures have been identified (e.g., Gastil 1975; Zelinsky 1973), and it is widely recognized that fundamentalist Protestantism has dominated the religious landscape of the South since the nineteenth century (Boles 1985; Gaustad 1976; Matthews 1977; Newman &amp; Halvorson 1984; Shibley 1991; Stump 1986). Further, southern community studies and various other attempts to characterize the region's religious ethos over the years have</page><page sequence="3">Southem Intolerance and Fundamentalism / 381 typically emphasized themes that are central to fundamentalism (e.g., Cash 1941; Hill 1966, 1972; Moreland 1958; Pope 1942): (1) beliefs that the Bible is inerrant and a sufficient guide for all of life's problems; (2) images of an anthropomorphic, hierarchical, judgmental God who participates actively in the lives of individuals; (3) the ubiquity of human sinfulness; and (4) the imperative of personal salvation as the only escape from eternal damnation at the hands of a righteous, punitive God. FUNDAMENTALISM AND INTOLERANCE Why might these religious values and practices reduce tolerance of various unpopular groups? First, several studies over the years have reported an inverse association between frequency of religious attendance and the willingness to extend civil liberties to unpopular groups (Nunn et al. 1978; Smidt &amp; Penning 1982; Stouffer 1955). Most religious groups distinguish carefully between in- groups and out-groups; indeed such distinctions are a critical part of the self- definition of most religious communities (Cochran 1989). The moral superiority of in-group norms and values is reiterated, while negative perceptions of the lifestyles of out-group members are reinforced via sermons and official communications from church leaders, as well as informal contacts among coreligionists. Thus, by attending religious services more frequently than residents of other regions, it is conceivable that southerners in general (and fundamentalists in particular) encounter greater exposure to emotionally charged intolerant messages than their counterparts who live elsewhere. Second, there are a number of reasons to anticipate that conservative theological views contribute to the observed regional variations in tolerance. Classical arguments supporting tolerance focus on the moral superiority and pragmatic efficiency of the "marketplace of ideas." That is, they assume that parties with divergent beliefs and lifestyles can learn from one another by exchanging views (Bollinger 1986; Jelen &amp; Wilcox 1991). However, fundamen- talists subscribe overwhelmingly to the doctrine of biblical literalism. As literalists, they maintain that the Bible constitutes purposive divine com- munication with humankind, and that scripture contains necessary and sufficient information to guide the conduct of all human affairs (Hunter 1987; Marsden 1980).3 This distinctive epistemological position suggests that there is little to be gained, and perhaps much to be lost, through contact and dialogue with the proponents of unbiblical (or "antibiblical") ideas and lifestyles. Some may view such exchanges as opportunities to evangelize, and to "bear witness" to the fruits of personal salvation. For other fundamentalists, the 'marketplace of ideas" paradigm may seem inappropriate because exposure to diverse ideas has the potential to confuse and corrupt rather than to enlighten (Wilcox &amp; Jelen 1990). Fundamentalist intolerance need not reflect a sense of threat or moral panic, but beliefs regarding a literal devil and a literal hell underscore the urgency and pervasiveness of the cosmic conflict between Good and Evil. Though social scientists rarely explore these facets of American popular culture, contemporary fundamentalist literature and music are filled with martial themes. One especially common motif depicts fundamentalist Protestants ("Bible-believing</page><page sequence="4">382 / Social Forces 72:2, December 1993 Christians") as persecuted soldiers for the Lord, valiantly struggling against ungodly forces in an unsympathetic, even hostile, world (e.g., see Marrs 1988). To the extent that certain values and lifestyles (e.g., atheism, homosexuality, communism) are viewed as pawns or stalking horses of Evil, fundamentalists may feel both encouraged and obliged to combat them. Further, some students of contemporary fundamentalism suggest that this focus on the legitimacy of biblical truth typifies a more general preoccupation with issues of authority and obedience (see Wald, Owen &amp; Hill 1989). These concerns surface frequently in the fundamentalist discussions of family, school, workplace, government, and other social institutions (e.g., see McNamara 1985; Peshkin 1986). Such "authority-mindedness" may incline fundamentalists to view (1) institutional authority figures as inherently legitimate, (2) conformity with orthodoxy and community standards as intrinsically virtuous, and (3) outcroppings of social and ideological diversity as warranting suspicion and even hostility. Thus, fundamentalists may express a visceral aversion to ideas or lifestyles that deviate from the cultural mainstream and/or challenge established authority relations, regardless of whether the values in question are condemned explicitly in the Bible. In sum, their conservative theological views may incline fundamentalists to favor actions and policies that limit the access of certain groups to public discourse, with several broad objectives in mind: (1) slowing the spread of immoral views; (2) stigmatizing and punishing ungodly elements; (3) affirming the moral virtue of mainstream views and lifestyles; and (4) clarifying the bounds of acceptable distourse and behavior for the rest of society. Finally, there is considerable evidence that fundamentalists are especially reluctant to extend civil liberties to unpopular groups, even when the estimated effects of variations in church attendance, biblical literalism, and other relevant factors are controlled statistically (Beatty &amp; Walter 1984; Wilcox &amp; Jelen 1990). To be sure, contemporary fundamentalist intolerance may partly reflect the impact of political mobilization efforts sponsored by organizations of the New Christian Right (Liebman &amp; Wuthnow 1983; Wuthnow 1988). However, it is also possible that certain institutional features of fundamentalist churches may undermine tolerance of nonconformity. For instance, Kelley (1972) argues that these religious groups are characterized by norms and reward structures that facilitate social solidarity among members and encourage conformity to clearly communicated behavioral and ideological guidelines (Wald, Owen &amp; Hill 1990). Given these various institutional mechanisms for sustaining conformity, fundamentalist Protestant groups may be more culturally homogeneous on average than other religious bodies, and consequently their members may be relatively insulated from competing worldviews and lifestyles. Moreover, despite the historical role of southern fundamentalism as a democratizing force (see Boles 1985; Matthews 1977), contemporary observers emphasize the hierarchical, asymmetrical relationship between fundamentalist pastors and their flocks. On the basis of her long-term observations of one congregation, Ammerman (1987) concludes:</page><page sequence="5">Southern Intolerance and Fundamentalism / 383 The preaching situation thus provides the model for authority: A biblically legitimated expert provides unquestioned and respected leadership for those less able to care for themselves. Because this model of social relationships involves an unequal division of authority and status, believers come to see such a division as valued and right - both inside and outside the church. They come to expect groups to be divided between sheep and shepherds. (Ammerman 1987:128) Ammerman suggests that individual fundamentalists may generalize the conformist lessons learned in such religious settings to other domains of social and political life. While the resulting wariness of challenges to the status quo may be especially pronounced with regard to left-wing groups, it is reasonable to expect that fundamentalist Protestants will express antipathy toward nonmainstream views across the ideological spectrum. This discussion leads us to anticipate three empirical patterns: (1) southern- ers, especially native southerners, will exhibit greater reluctance to extend civil liberties to unpopular groups than residents of other regions of the country; (2) conservative theological views, fundamentalist denominational ties, and frequent religious attendance, will be inversely associated with tolerance; (3) statistical adjustments for the estimated effects of these religious variables, particularly theological conservatism, will attenuate the observed regional differences in tolerance. Data and Measurement DATA To explore these issues in greater detail, we analyze data from the 1988 General Social Survey (GSS) (Davis &amp; Smith 1990). The GSS is a cross-sectional national survey replicated every year since 1972, with the exception of 1979 and 1981. The 1988 edition of the GSS is singularly appropriate for the project at hand because it includes a unique array of items focusing on religious practices, moral beliefs, and tolerance toward unpopular segments of American society, as well as information on the regional background, sociodemographic charac- teristics, and political views of the respondents. Since 1987, the GSS has employed a split ballot interview design (Davis &amp; Smith 1990: Appendix P). In 1988, for instance, the items on tolerance were asked of only 977 of the 1,481 total respondents. DEPENDENT VARIABLES: TOLERANCE Tolerance refers to the willingness to extend civil liberties to deviant groups. To minimize the risk of conflating tolerance with liberalism, a number of previous studies have emphasized the importance of measuring tolerance toward a range of nonmainstream groups from both the left and right of the sociopolitical spectrum (e.g., Bobo &amp; Licari 1989; Wilson 1991). The 1988 GSS includes a total of 15 items gauging the willingness of respondents to extend civil liberties to five target groups: homosexuals, communists, atheists (individuals who are "against all churches and religion"), militarists (individuals who "advocate</page><page sequence="6">384 / Social Forces 72:2, December 1993 doing away with elections and letting the military run the country"), and racists (individuals who "believe that blacks are genetically inferior"). For each target group, respondents are asked: (1) whether they would support the removal of a book authored by such a person from the public library in their community, (2) whether they would permit such a person to give a public speech in their community, and (3) whether they would allow such a person to be employed as a college instructor. The responses to all items are coded dichotomously (yes/no). We examine six dependent variables in this study. An index of overall tolerance was constructed by summing responses to these 15 items (a= .91). In addition to the overall index, we also analyze group-specific indices for atheists (a= .73), communists (a= .78), militarists (a= .78), homosexuals (a -.83), and racists (a =.71). Given that all indicators of tolerance are continuous variables, the analytic technique used here is ordinary least squares (OLS) regression. INDEPENDENT VARIABLES: REGION AND RELIGIOUS ORIENTATIONS Region We distinguish four regional groups: native southerners, in-migrants, out- migrants, and native nonsoutherners. We characterize as "native southerners" those persons who resided in a southern state (U.S. Census designation) at age 16 and who also resided in a southern state at the time of the GSS interview. "In-migrants" are those persons who lived outside the South at age 16, but resided in a southern state at the time of the interview, while "out-migrants" were nonsouthern residents who reported living in the South at age 16. In the OLS regression models that follow, we include dummy variables to identify each of these groups, using native nonsoutherners as the comparison group (omitted category). This analytical strategy is consistent with the approach used in most previous studies on this topic (e.g., Tuch 1987; Wilson 1986).5 FUNDAMENTALIST DENOMINATIONAL PREFERENCE For the purposes of this study, fundamentalist denominations include the following: Southern Baptist, Independent Baptist, Evangelical Congregational, Assemblies of God, Brethren, Church of Christ (except United Church of Christ), Churches of God, Church of God in Christ, Evangelical (and Evangelical Reformed), Full Gospel, Foursquare Gospel, Holiness (and related groups), Nazarene (and Free Methodist), Missouri Synod Lutheran, Pentecostal (and related groups), Sanctified/Sanctification, Seventh Day Adventist, and assorted smaller evangelical and fundamentalist groups. This classificatory scheme follows closely the one proposed by Roof and McKinney (1987:253-56) for use with GSS data.6 RELIGIOUS AITENDANCE Frequency of attendance at religious services is measured via a single item, which is coded as follows: (0) never; (1) less than once per year; (2) about once or twice per year; (3) several times per year; (4) about once a month; (5) two or three times per month; (6) nearly every week; (7) every week; and (8) several times per week.</page><page sequence="7">Southern Intolerance and Fundamentalism / 385 THEOLOGICAL CONSERVAnSM To simplify the analyses, we have combined several indicators of the conser- vative theological views described above into a single indicator. This nine-item index (a - .86) follows the one proposed by Olson and Carroll (1992). One dichotomous item in the theological conservatism index identifies biblical literalists. Literalists (approximately 34% of the GSS respondents) are in- dividuals who agree with the following statement: "The Bible is the actual word of God and is to be taken literally, word for word." Another item taps orien- tations toward human sinfulness, eliciting responses to the following statement: "Those who violate God's rules must be punished." Responses to this item range from (1) "strongly disagree" to (4) "strongly agree." Three of these items in the theological conservatism index gauge the importance of conforming to orthodox religious norms. They ask the respondent how important he/she feels that it is for a good Christian (or Jew) to attend religious services regularly, to follow faithfully the teachings of their church of synagogue, and to believe in God without doubt. Responses to these items range from (1) "not very important" to (5) "very important." Two additional items inquire about the centrality of religious scripture and values in the personal lives of respondents. They ask each respondent whether the Bible and the teachings of his/her church or synagogue are crucial factors in personal decision making. Responses to these items also range from (1) "not very important" to (5) "very important." Finally, two items inquire about the certainty of the respondent's faith. One of these asks whether the respondent believes in God without doubt; responses range from (1) "my faith is mixed with doubts" to (7) "my faith is completely free of doubts." The other item presents a series of six statements about personal faith and asks the respondent to choose which statement approximates his/her beliefs. The most orthodox response category is "I know God really exists and I have no doubts about it," while the most heterodox category is "I don't believe in God." Because these various items are measured in different metrics, we have computed the theological conservatism index using standard scores. SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND OTHER COVARIATES We can -only be confident of our findings after we have included statistical controls for sociodemographic and other variables that have been shown to be associated with tolerance (Bobo &amp; Licari 1989; Wilson 1991): education (years of schooling completed); family income (20-point summary scale); age (actual years); gender (1 = female); race (1 = black); and city size (10-point summary scale, with 10 denoting residence within an SMSA and a large central city with a population over 250,000). As further insurance against the conflation of tolerance and ideological liberalism, we also introduce statistical controls for variations in self-reported political ideology. This single item ranges from (1) "extremely liberal" to (7) "extremely conservative."</page><page sequence="8">386 / Social Forces 72:2, December 1993 A NOTE ON MISSING DATA In this study, missing data are generally handled via listwise deletion. However, there are two exceptions to this rule. First, because a substantial proportion (20.3%) of the GSS respondents were missing data on at least one of the 15 tolerance items, we substituted the valid sample mean scores for these items in an effort to maximize the effective sample size. Individuals missing valid responses on more than seven of these items were dropped from the analyses.7 Second, given the nontrivial proportion (9.9%) of respondents who were unable or unwilling to provide valid data on family income, we also substituted valid sample means on this variable. Then we included a dummy variable in our regression equations to identify the cases that had been missing information on family income prior to imputation. Because this missing income dummy variable surfaced consistently as a negative predictor of tolerance in preliminary analyses, we also include it in the final models discussed below. Results OVERALL TOLERANCE Table 1 presents hierarchical OLS models of overall tolerance. Model 1 depicts baseline regional differences in tolerance, adjusted for relevant controls, while models 2 to 4 also include measures of religious affiliation, participation, and belief. These results confirm the conventional wisdom that substantial differen- ces in overall tolerance between native southerners and native nonsouthemers persist, even with the potentially confounding estimated effects of socio- demographic characteristics and political ideology held constant. However, in- migrants and out-migrants are not significantly different from native non- southemers in overall tolerance once relevant background factors are taken into account. While interpretive caution is warranted given the cross-sectional nature of these data, this pattern is consistent with arguments that migration into the South from other areas of the country may be moderating some aspects of the attitudinal distinctiveness that has historically characterized the region (Ellison 1991; Tuch 1987). Consistent with prior research on religion and tolerance (e.g., Wilcox &amp; Jelen 1990), models 2 and 3 indicate that members of fundamentalist denomina- tions and frequent churchgoers are less tolerant than other persons. Although these relationships are statistically significant, the denominational and atten- dance variables combine to account for a relatively small portion (approximately 2%) of the total variation in overall tolerance. Their estimated net effects are sharply attenuated by the inclusion of a direct measure of theological conser- vatism, which emerges as the single strongest (negative) predictor of overall tolerance in model 4.8 Taken together, however, the results in Table 1 seemingly contradict the argument that low levels of southern tolerance reflect the impact of a fun- damentalist Protestant religious culture.9 Indeed, while the addition of religious variables to models 2 to 4 reduces the estimated net difference in overall tolerance between native southerners and native nonsoutherners by some 35%,</page><page sequence="9">Southern Intolerance and Fundamentalism / 387 TABLE 1: Estimated Net Effects of Region, Religious Factors, and Covariates on Overall Tolerancea (1) (2) (3) (4) Key independent variables Native southerner -1.655/-.154*** -1.346/-.125*** -1.335/-.124*** -1.065/-.099* (.325) (.336) (.335) (.324) Out-migrant -.705/-.031 -.366/-.016 -.433/-.019 -.105/-.005 (.708) (.711) (.706) (.680) In-migrant -1.016/-.058 -.972/-.055 -.895/-.051 -.726/-.041 (.526) (.523) (.520) (.503) Fund.

Although the estimated net effects of sociodemographic factors on tolerance are not the primary focus of this study, several findings merit brief discussion. Two striking patterns are quite consistent with prior work in this area. First, educational attainment emerges as the strongest (positive) sociodemographic predictor of tolerance, although the inclusion of theological conservatism in model 4 reduces the estimated net effect of education by roughly 25%. Second, age is inversely associated with the willingness to extend civil liberties to unpopular groups, although it is unclear in cross-sectional data whether this is best interpreted as a life-cycle effect or a cohort effect (Glenn 1977). Given the findings of prior research on urbanism and tolerance (see Wilson 1991 for review), on the other hand, it is somewhat surprising that the ordinal measure of city size in the 1988 GSS is unrelated to overall tolerance. While income per se has little bearing on tolerance, individuals who decline to provide valid information on their household incomes are significantly less tolerant than others. There are no consistent racial or gender variations in overall tolerance. Finally, self-reported political conservatism is inversely associated with overall tolerance in models 1 to 3; however, the inclusion of theological conservatism in the full model reduces the estimated net effect of political ideology to statistical nonsignificance. TOLERANCE OF LEFr-WING GROUPS To examine the relationships between region, religious factors, and tolerance in more detail, we disaggregate the index of overall tolerance, focusing first on tolerance of left-wing groups (Table 2), and then on tolerance of right-wing groups (Table 3). The models in Table 2 focus exclusively on tolerance of communists, atheists, and homosexuals. In ancillary hierarchical OLS models (not shown), the patterns of religious effects paralleled those reported in Table 1. Therefore, to conserve space, we display only the baseline and full models for each target group under consideration.10 In addition, because the estimated net effects of covariates in these group-specific models are generally similar to those discussed above, we restrict our discussion to the key issues at hand. Several basic patterns are of interest here. First, in each set of models, native southerners are much less tolerant than native nonsoutherners, while in- migrants and out-migrants are not significantly different from native non- southerners in this regard. Second, theological conservatism is again the strongest (negative) predictor of tolerance toward each target group under consideration. The estimated net effects of the other religious factors are negligible, with the exception of a weak positive net association between frequency of religious attendance and the willingness to extend civil liberties to communists in model 4. Most importantly for the purposes at hand, the inclusion of theological conservatism and the other religious variables does not completely attenuate the estimated net regional differences in any of the models presented here. For example, the regional difference in tolerance of atheists is diminished by</page><page sequence="11">Southern Intolerance and Fundamentalism / 389 roughly 40% when religious factors are considered. Reductions in the mag- nitude of regional differences are weaker still in models of tolerance of communists (33%) and homosexuals (25%).11 In each instance, native southern- ers remain considerably less tolerant than native nonsoutherners despite the inclusion of the full array of controls. TOLERANCE OF RIGHT-WING GROUPS Table 3 presents analyses estimating the effects of region, religious factors, and covariates on tolerance of racists and militarists. While the initial estimated regional variations in tolerance (model 1) are nontrivial in magnitude, they are noticeably less pronounced than the regional differences in tolerance of left- wing groups reported in Tables 1 and 2. Thus, native southerners appear somewhat less reluctant to extend civil liberties to unpopular right-wing elements than to left-wing groups, even with the confounding effects of self- reported political ideology held constant. As in earlier models, theological conservatism emerges as the strongest (negative) predictor of tolerance. However, in contrast to the results presented earlier, the patterns in Table 3 generally support the argument that southern intolerance results from fundamentalist religious culture. In part because regional differences in tolerance of right-wing groups are relatively modest to begin with, the inclusion of theological conservatism and other religious controls in models 2 and 4 reduces these differences in tolerance of right-wing groups to statistical nonsignificance.12 Discussion This study has elaborated and tested the hypothesis - advanced earlier by Jelen (1982) - that the widely reported southern intolerance toward unpopular groups reflects the impact of fundamentalist Protestantism in the South. Our analyses offer only weak support for this argument. To be sure, when regional variations in aspects of regional religious culture - theological conservatism and to a lesser extent fundamentalist denominational affiliation and frequency of religious attendance - are controlled, regional differences in tolerance of racists and militarists are sharply attenuated. However, regional differences in tolerance of left-wing groups such as communists, homosexuals, and atheists are more striking in magnitude, and the inclusion of religious controls reduces these regional differences by less than half. Thus, while the prominence of fundamen- talist Protestant institutions and beliefs clearly contributes to southern reluctance to grant civil liberties to various unpopular elements, regional religious culture at least as it is measured here - does not appear to account for native southern antipathy toward left-wing groups. Other than the role of conservative religious institutions and beliefs in southern culture, what other factors might explain these residual regional variations in tolerance? These differences may result from the comparative cultural homogeneity of the South, and the insulation of native southerners from personal encounters with, and sustained public discourse over, minority sociopolitical views and alternative lifestyles.

In addition, regardless of their personal religious views, many native southerners steeped in regional tradition may perceive left-wing groups as threats to the status quo or the very existence of core social institutions (i.e., capitalism, religion, nuclear families). Though these and other potential nonreligious factors merit attention in future research, investigators would also be wise to consider two additional religious explanations for the findings reported here. First, distinctive southern orientations toward civil liberties issues may partly reflect regional differences in commitment to American civil religion, particularly its more conservative variant (see Wuthnow 1988 for review). In brief, civil religious tradition holds that America is a "covenant society," a "New Israel" that enjoys the fruits and bears the responsibilities of a special collective relationship with God. According to the more conservative strand of this tradition, America will be blessed with peace, prosperity, and power as long as its leaders sustain the Judeo-Christian tradition and implement its moral values through the policies of the state. Failure to fulfill the demands of this covenant, on the other hand, is thought to invite divine judgement and societal decay. While data limitations preclude a thorough examination of this issue, the links between region, civil religious beliefs, and intolerance clearly deserve further study. Second, it is important to note that the content of a distinctive southern religious culture is only partly indexed by the measures of individual beliefs and practices employed in this study. Because they reside in areas with concentra- tions of fundamentalist Protestants, many native southerners are likely to experience routine, long-term exposure to a wide range of intolerant messages.13 Thus, intolerant views may crystallize even among those southerners who do not embrace fundamentalist theological tenets, as a cumulative consequence of exchanges with strangers in public settings, as well as regular social network members (i.e., neighbors and co-workers). 4 Further, a public culture shaped by fundamentalist Protestant values is likely to be expressed and affirmed in the pronouncements of local notables and officials, and in local and regional media (e.g., editorials and talk shows) and cultural products (e.g., regional music). These arguments suggest the potential importance of contextual as well as individual religious factors in accounting for regional variations in tolerance. Although nultilevel analyses have been implemented widely in other subfields of the discipline (e.g., Billy &amp; Moore 1992), studies of this type have rarely been undertaken by sociologists of religion. While such an investigation lies beyond the scope of the present study, it would require bridging levels of analysis, perhaps by including county-level measures of denominational concentration and/or church member rates (Bradley et al. 1992) in the types of analyses reported in Tables 1 to 3. To be sure, the available aggregate religious data draw upon official denominational membership statistics, and therefore they are not without distortions. Particularly worrisome are the systematic under- representations of African-American religious denominations and some fundamentalist Protestant sects and independent congregations; these groups would be of obvious interest in any investigation of southern religious culture. Debates continue regarding the appropriate strategies for correcting ithe biases</page><page sequence="16">394 / Social Forces 72:2, December 1993 that are evident in such denominational statistics (Bainbridge 1990; Stark 1987). Nevertheless, the careful consideration of contextual effects constitutes a logical next step in efforts to understand regional variations in tolerance, and perhaps other aspects of southern cultural distinctiveness as well. Notes 1. Some observers have suggested that southern intolerance is one manifestation of a more general outlook that prevails in many underdeveloped regions around the globe. They argue that this "traditional" mind-set is characterized by localism, fatalism, respect for authority, attachment to custom, and related orientations (Reed 1983). 2. Following a number of recent studies (e.g., Peek, Lowe &amp; Williams 1991; Smith 1990), we use the term hfndamentalist throughout this study to refer to conservative evangelical Protestants. It is important to note that this term is hotly contested. For instance, while some leading Pentecostals have publicly labeled themselves "fundamentalists," other self-proclaimed fundamentalists reject them because of disputes over the biblical basis of beliefs in glossolalia (i.e., tongues) and other "gifts of the spirit." 3. Although fundamentalists would disagree (or they would cease to be fundamentalists), nonfundamentalists argue that the Bible, like any text, contains passages that permit multiple readings. Thus, it is important to note that "literal" understandings of scripture do not emerge in mechanical fashion from the solitary studies of individual fundamentalists. Rather, we assume that such literal understandings are social products, generated and disseminated within interpretive communities. Stanley Fish (1980), perhaps the leading proponent of this concept, defines them as follows: Interpretive communities are made up of those who share interpretive strategies not only for reading (in the conventional sense) but for writing texts, for constituting their properties and assigning their intentions. In other words, these strategies exist prior to the act of reading and therefore determine the shape of what is read rather than, as is usually assumed, the other way around. (171) Interpretive communities made up of networks of fundamentalist theologians and pastors shape the patterns of scriptural understanding that prevail among rank-and-file fundamen- talists, with the aid of a handful of accepted commentaries (e.g., the New Scofield Reference Bible) and other selected extratextual sources (Boone 1989). Literalism as a distinctive interpretive strategy both (1) presumes and (2) is committed to sustaining the unity and inerrancy of the text (see Barr 1981; Boone 1989). Given these a priori assumptions about the Bible, literalists are disinclined to contextualize violent or judgmental passages in the Old and New Testaments - that is, to interpret them in terms of the historical circumstances and distant cultural milieux from which those passages emerged. Consequently, while many nonliteralists dismiss or downplay such biblical passages in favor of the more humanitarian flavor of the New Testament, particularly certain teachings of Jesus, literalists are prone to give these intolerant passages more credence. 4. As one anonymous reviewer points out, there is an apparent similarity between certain aspects of fundamentalist Protestantism discussed in this study - admiration of authority, conformity to community standards, and rigidly dichotomous styles of thinking - and classic notions of authoritarianism. Numerous studies (e.g., Middleton 1976) have discussed the role of authoritarianism and related ego-defensive personality dynamics in fostering intolerance, and some have also argued that theological conservatism promotes authoritarianism (see Webster &amp; Stewart 1973 for review). However, Wald et al. (1989) distinguish carefully between authoritarianism and authority-mindedness. The latter involves a cognitive choice: pronounced deference to societal authority figures results from the embrace of biblical authority. Wald and colleagues present evidence that contemporary fundamentalist Protestants are authority-minded without being authoritarian (at least according to the conventional understanding and measurement of authoritarianism).</page><page sequence="17">Southern Intolerance and Fundamentalism / 395 5. While this approach is commonly used in research on regional variations in attitudes, two caveats must be entered. First, while it would be preferable to construct our regional variables in terms of the Confederate South, like previous researchers using the GSS, we are unable to do so. The GSS omits state-level identifiers due to concerns about respondent confidentiality (see Davis &amp; Smith 1990: Appendix D). The U.S. census definition of the South includes some areas that were not part of the Confederacy. The most culturally marginal of these areas would appear to be Delaware, Maryland, Florida (particularly southern Florida), and the District of Columbia. To some extent, as states that were not members of the Confederacy, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Oklahoma may also lie outside the southern cultural core. Though we suspect that the small number of respondents from most marginal areas introduces minimal bias into the findings reported here, the GSS samples heavily from the major standard metropolitan statistical areas (SMSAs) in these areas (e.g., Washington, Miami, Baltimore). The influence of respondents from these urban areas in our estimation of regional differences should be reduced by the inclusion of a city size variable (i.e., the XNORCSIZ variable in the GSS) as a control in all analyses. Second, although we refer to "native" southerners (and nonsoutherners) throughout this study, there is no doubt measurement error here as well. For instance, place of residence at age 16 does not indicate place of birth or place of childhood socialization. Similarly, in an era of extensive geographical mobility and multiple relocations, "native" nonsouthemers may have lived in the South at some point. These caveats notwithstanding, the vast majority of respondents who resided in the South at age 16 surely spent some significant portion of their formative years and/or adolescence in a southern cultural milieu. 6. Our denominational classification scheme parallels the one employed by Jelen (1982) in an earlier examination of this issue. It is also similar to the one proposed by Smith (1990), except that we, like Roof and McKinney (1987), exclude Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses from the fundamentalist camp. Our decision is based on two considerations: (1) Historically these groups have been marginal to southern fundamentalism and regional culture; and (2) A num- ber of previous studies confirm that, because of their distinctive histories of exclusion and persecution in the U.S., both Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses profess considerably higher levels of tolerance than members of other groups that are more central to the fundamentalist camp (Beatty &amp; Walter 1984; Roof &amp; McKinney 1987). 7. We have also run ancillary analyses using listwise deletion to deal with missing values on the tolerance items. Some 93 (9.5%) of the original 977 respondents are missing valid information on one of the 15 items, while an additional 41 (4.2%) are missing on two items and 32 (3.3%) are missing on three items. Another 32 respondents are missing data on more than three of the 15 items. The use of listwise deletion procedures instead of mean substitution introduced only trivial changes in the results. 8. The zero-order correlations among the three religious variables of interest here are as follows: attendance and theological conservatism (r- .52, p &lt; .001), fundamentalist denomina- tional ties and theological conservatism (r - .30, p &lt; .001), and fundamentalist denominational ties and attendance (r = .11, p &lt; .001). 9. The actual mean differences among regions in the three religious variables are as follows. Some 46.6% of native southerners report affiliation with fundamentalist Protestant denomina- tions; this figure compares with 55.4% of out-migrants, 16.8% of in-migrants, and 14.4% of native nonsoutherners. Differences between native southerners and out-migrants are not statistically significant, but the differences between both groups and in-migrants and native nonsoutherners are strongly significant (p &lt; .001). A somewhat similar pattern surfaces with regard to theological conservatism. Mean scores for native southerners and out-migrants on this index are .225 and .355, respectively (the sample mean is 0). Again, while the difference between these two groups is not significant, both mean scores diverge sharply (p &lt;.001) from those of in-migrants (-.041) and native nonsoutherners (-.170). On the other hand, regional differences in the frequency of religious attendance are much less striking. Mean scores are as follows: native southerners (4.07), out-migrants (3.99), in-migrants (4.25), and native non- southerners (3.68). Here only the difference between native southerners and native non- southerners is statistically significant (p &lt;.02).</page><page sequence="18">396 / Social Forces 72:2, December 1993 10. Additional information, including a full correlation matrix and descriptive statistics on all variables used in these analyses, is omitted to conserve space. However, this information is available from the authors upon request. 11. Readers may be surprised to find that certain dimensions of religiosity are not considered in these analyses. For instance, frequency of prayer (or frequency of devotional activities) is one indicator of personal religiosity that is often employed in survey analyses of this type. However, there is scant theoretical or empirical reason to anticipate relationships between devotion and tolerance. On the other hand, several studies using pre-1985 GSS data have reported associations between images of God (especially those involving hierarchical images) and various attitudinal outcomes (e.g., Ellison 1991). Given that we alluded to the possible importance of these themes at the outset, our decision not to indude them here deserves brief comment. Our preliminary analyses of the 1988 GSS data turned up no association between images of God and tolerance, with or without controls for theological conservatism. However, crucial changes in the wording of these items in the GSS after 1984 undermine the com- parability of our preliminary findings here with those of earlier studies using the items on God images. 12. We also considered the altemative hypothesis that theological conservatism and the other religious variables undermine tolerance more strongly for native southerners than for other GSS respondents. To conduct these additional analyses, we included cross-product terms (e.g., native southerner x theological conservatism, in-migrant x theological conservatism, etc.) in the full models of tolerance presented in Tables 1 to 3. Contrary to this alternative hypothesis, however, we found no evidence that the estimated slope coefficients of theological conser- vatism and the other religious variables vary according to region. Finally, while prior research raises the possibility that the estimated net effects of fundamentalist affiliation and belief on various social attitudes may vary according to race (Young 1992), age/cohort (Hunter 1987), and gender (Peek, Lowe &amp; Williams 1991), these issues lie beyond the scope of the present study. 13. Jelen (1982) makes a somewhat similar point: "It is not implausible to suppose that Protestant fundamentalists may dominate Southem social life to such an extent that they may impart politically relevant attitudes and information to nonfundamentalist Southerners" (82). However, he goes on to suggest that nonreligious and nonfundamentalist southerners are embedded within social networks of like-minded others, relatively insulated from fundamen- talist influence (83-84). This issue of contextual effects merits further investigation. 14. At first glance, the 1988 GSS items on the religious ties of social network members would seemingly permit a proximate test of our network-based arguments. Unfortunately, this is not the case for several reasons: (1) It would be a strategic error to focus on close network members rather than community climate, since one suspects that casual exchanges with strangers and acquaintances also influence views on public issues. (2) Moreover, the responses to these network items are characterized by limited variance and unacceptable amounts of missing data. Many GSS respondents do not know the denominational preferences of their network members. (3) In 1988 (unlike in previous years), the GSS includes no items that tap the frequency of contact among network members. References Abrahamson, Mark, and Valerie J. Carter. 1986.
