<plain_text><page sequence="1">Waiting for Wolves in Japan: An Anthropological Study of People-Wildlife Relations. By John Knight. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2003. xii, 296 pages. ?47.00. Reviewed by K. SlVARAMAKRISHNAN University of Washington After a trip to Japan in 1959, Alexandre Koj?ve wrote about a society that did not appear to forecast human decline into animality in a period when the human condition had attained the pinnacle of historical development. A sit uation where further evolution would appear was not possible. He called this "post-historical" life. Koj?ve argued, "Snobbery in its pure state created disciplines negating the 'natural' or 'animal'" which were stronger than cul tural patterns shaped by "warlike and revolutionary Struggles or from forced Work."l One wonders if Koj?ve would have been less optimistic about Japanese snobbery and its abilities to prevent the decline of human ci vility had he been exposed to the pervasive war idiom that John Knight dis cusses in his accounts of how villagers, storytellers, planners, and conser vationists recount people-wildlife relations in the mountain villages of Japan. Kojeve's somewhat tongue-in-cheek reflections on his visit to Japan do, however, provoke more basic considerations about how dualistic ways of thinking about humans and animals are produced and become the basis for both anthropological theories and public policies. A lot is at stake here. Hu manism itself can be investigated, for its limits are exposed in the separation of both human from divine and human from animal. At the highest level, as Giorgio Agamben suggests, the issue probably is one of understanding the formation of human life as a category. To inquire into this issue, Agamben suggests that we not wonder at the conjunctions of the natural and the su pernatural, but ponder, in fact, "the political and practical mysteries of sep 1.

What is man, if he is always the place?and, at the same time, the result?of ceaseless divisions?"2 John Knight's study, based on extended ethnographic research in moun tain villages of the Kii Peninsula in western Japan, provokes renewed reflec tion on this question. As he notes, anthropological analyses of natural symbolism are typically predicated on an a priori nature-culture or nature-society opposition. . . .But in present day Japan, as a result of what I have called double encroachment, wild an imals and mountain villagers cannot be placed into separate "natural" and "social" domains with the former representing a "mirror" to change in the latter, (p. 245) The wealth of evidence and analysis that Knight painstakingly assembles, however, takes Agamben's philosophical question into an empirical analysis of historical environmental change and its relation to social change. His study questions "ceaseless divisions" and reminds us that within the human individual, and society, the boundary between animal and nonanimal is con stantly under construction, but in terms that are historically determined. In his thoughtful examination of human fear of, and respect for, wild an imals, Knight adds ably to a very small literature on human-wildlife rela tions in anthropology and history. Fear feeds both the desire to control, and possibly eradicate, the source of fear as well as processes of self-question ing and self-criticism. This double process is clearly evident in human rela tions with charismatic wild animals such as wolves, tigers, bears, and ele phants. Writing of Malay responses to tigers that often regarded those animals as the embodiments of souls of ancestors, Peter Boomgard notes "there need not be a contradiction between the notion of the tiger as family and the feelings of fear inspired by these animals."3 The ambivalence of fear, though, does not operate free of other emotions and influences on hu man action on wild animals. Commerce and conservation have become ma jor pressures on human-animal relations along the forest-edges, to use Knight's term, all over Asia. In India, for instance, protected tigers have paid a heavy price for their entanglements in human lives in the forests and be yond, as they are slaughtered in large numbers to supply body parts all over Asia and the United States.4 John Knight provides a well-illustrated study, admirable for the clarity of exposition, with effective use of aggregate statistics, and thoughtful 2.

After providing an introduction to the mountain villages, Knight considers the relations between these villages and various wild animals. In a series of chapters arranged to open with a con sideration of imagery and move into a consideration of material relations, he writes about wild boar, deer, monkeys, bear, and finally the wolf. Knight notes (p. 2) that in contrast to people-wildlife conflicts in most parts of Asia and Africa, and even for that matter in places like the American West, in mountain Japan these conflicts have occurred since the 1950s in a context of declining rural populations. Smaller and older communities of farmers have been losing the battle to protect their farms, tree plantations, and stores of grain from the depredations of monkeys, deer, wild boar, and bears. Throughout the book he explores how this environmental change affects people-wildlife relations in one area of Japan, drawing on a variety of sources that include detailed ethnography, thorough research in folklore and popular accounts, and a wide comparative analysis that frequently refers to appropriate examples from other societies in Europe, the United States, and Asia. As the book progresses, informative comparisons emerge between the animals and the subtle differences in how they are viewed by villagers, by middle-class urban Japanese, and in the oral tradition that both groups ap propriate for constructing national cultural values toward these animals. Knight very usefully compares the ways in which boars, monkeys, and bears appear in the lives of villagers and townspeople. He is careful to distinguish the precise ways they become pestilential or dangerous, the ways they are sought to be repelled, and how they always seem to end up being fetishized in parks and domestic displays. Knight never misses an opportunity to point out the folkloric and contemporary ritual incorporation of these animals into human life cycles, by anthropomorphism or deification. Medicinal, spiri tual, and practical uses of animal body parts and symbolism are described with rich ethnographic evidence. One of the chief ways humans interact with wild animals is through hunting, which John Knight discusses in detail for each animal. He notes that hunting is mostly a sport, a Westernized recreation in much of Japan, replete with camouflage jackets, European hunting dogs, and U.S. hunting magazines. But its older history of supplying meat, hides, and medicine is not entirely forgotten. For some older Hong? men, "hunting may not be practised for livelihood, but it retains the status of a potentially vital liveli hood activity in times of adversity" (p. 42). Yet, like rice cultivation, hunt ing is declining. Registered hunters in 2000 were half the number they were in 1975. And their average age is now 60, suggesting an impending crisis in the reproduction of hunting as a lifestyle or even as a pastime. A fine dis</page><page sequence="4">Review Section 439 cussion of boar hunting (pp. 69-79) reveals the admiration of the hunter for the boar?its courage, strength, and guile. Knight notes that hunting pro vides an occasion for villagers to explore masculinity and skill, but also to learn if other villagers are truthful and generous. While farmers and hunters fight wars (a word they use a lot) with boars, markets for boar meat and boar tourism have led to boar farming and the creation of parks (p. 80). Bear hunting was often the ultimate test of a man's courage and strength as close combat and the use of a spear were common. Despite the regular killing of bears as pests or game, there are also numerous rituals and obser vances associated with dead bears that indicate a profound fear of bear spir its, the curse of bears, and the need to respect a worthy foe. These rituals in dicate to Knight the idea that "lives of bears and humans were ... viewed as commensurable and even equivalent" (p. 186). An interesting theme that comes up is how this coexistence is viewed by villagers and conservation ists. As modes of intimate hunting give way to more remote hunting with telescopic rifles and killing of bears in denning periods, it is harder to ob serve the sense of commensurable lives in admittedly violent encounters. In his sensitive account of human-wildlife relations, Knight is careful not to caricature the people and animals involved. He successfully high lights the relationship between different aspects of landscape change and so cial change. As he shows, industrial forestry with its reliance on clear felling techniques creates inner forest-edges that create favorable habitat for deer and serow that like the herbaceous vegetation of such edges. Forest man agement may have created the eruptive fluctuations in deer and serow pop ulations that in the more popular accounts appear as the relentless growth of ungulate and herbivore populations detrimental to private plantations (p. 152). Everything from deer parks to golf courses tends to create habitat favorable to these ungulates. The resultant population increases conflict be tween villagers and the animals. Villagers who cull pests do so without dramatic fear. Routine familiar ity with animals that at various times have been partially domesticated, rit ually hunted, consumed in various ways, and worshiped ensures that when, for instance, a bear enters the village and eats persimmons alongside an old woman dusting mats, no one attacks it or even chases it away (p. 190). Foresters, in the same way, are not easily described as bear haters despite the damage bears do to their plantations. As Knight notes, some experienced foresters are aware that bears unable to find trees for winter denning are forced into old mine shafts or old timber plantations. They enter villages, compelled by the transformation of their forest habitat from mixed oak to cedar and cypress, looking for food no longer available in the forest itself. The depopulation of mountain villages emerges in Knight's account not merely as a local struggle but as a process that can undermine the nation it</page><page sequence="5">440 Journal of Japanese Studies 31:2 (2005) self. Not only is there territorial loss to an "enemy" in a "war," the entry of wild animals into human habitation is a direct challenge to the claims of the nation-state to protect its citizens from loss of life and property by main taining a fairly predictable social order. The loss of home, by human mi grants and displaced animals, can prove a source of empathy between poor rural migrants and the animals that may have contributed to their mobility. But the analogy between humans and animals out of place can also serve the fear tactics employed by conservationists to elicit urban support for forest and animal protection schemes, or the production of wilderness. The changing nature of human relations to wild animals over the twen tieth century is well captured in the story Knight tells about wolves and their extinction in the Kii Peninsula (p. 195). In transforming the scene and mem ory of wolf extermination, and the attendant story of violent victory over the wild, into a place where natural Japan is remembered, produced, and visited, the people of the mountain villages of western Japan are joined in a new en terprise and a very different way of making a living from the land. But across this historical trajectory, no animal Knight discusses better captures the abiding effort of his book to question the separations between wild and do mestic, human and animal, than the ubiquitous dog. The most valuable do mesticate in the mountain village is the dog, as it accompanies hunter and farmer in numerous tasks, many of them dangerous. The faithful dog plays the role of forward troops, taking high numbers of casualties in service of the human war against wild nature. Dogs also act "as a living sensor of movement about the village . . . providing an extra barrier between domes tic and public space" (p. 213). Hounds, like the Kish?, are examples of the blurred boundaries between the feral and the tame that forest villagers con stantly negotiate in their livelihood practices. The Kish? hound's wolf-ness is both a desirable attribute and a source of danger to the many elderly and children who suffer its attacks at home and in the village. Providing a fund of information, mostly about animals and their repre sentation in villages around their habitat and national popular culture, John Knight successfully introduces welcome sophistication into the discussion of human-wildlife relations. Yet he writes with admirable cogency and sim plicity to reach a wider audience in environmental anthropology, cultural studies of nature, and the world of conservation policymakers. This fine book should receive a large and appreciative audience.</page></plain_text>
