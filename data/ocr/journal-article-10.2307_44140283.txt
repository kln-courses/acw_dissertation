<plain_text><page sequence="1">PRESIDENTIAL ADDRESS ARCHAEOLOGY AND NATIONAL INTEGRATION A. Sundara (Mysore) Dear Delegates , 1.1 At the outset, I express my profound thanks to the authorities of the Indian History Congress and especially to the members of the Section of the Historical Archaeology, Epigraphy and Ntmhmatics, for having elected me to the Piesidentship of this Section. Of course, I have been carrying out explorations and excavations of archaeological remains for the last 27 years in a humble way, mostly in the northern part of Karnataka, after having excellent training in the Archaeological Survey of India during 1957 under the able and scholarly guidence of Sri M. N. Deshpande, Director General (Rctd.). Sri K. R. Srinivasan and Sri Krishna Deva of the Survey. At this moment, I consider it to be my duty to remember them gratefully fcr whatever work I have been doing in the field of Archaeology. 1.2 In the course of my village to village survey of antiquarian remains, I have had very valuable experience especially with the common folk of the villages. It is in the light of this experience and with reference to the prevailing appaling conditions in the country, I think, that Archaeology can be pressed for service in the cause of National Integration. I there- fore, selected this theme for the address to share my views in this respect with my fellow delegates and other scholars of the country. II Present situation 2.1 Of the many burning problems such as student indiscipline, unen&gt; ploymeat, political frauds, economic disparities, soeial conflicts that are</page><page sequence="2">846 plaguing our country, obviously the most serious and dangerous are the present day emotional tendencies and activities that threaten the very integrity and security of our nation. 2.2 Regional disputes, linguistic quarrels, communal disharmony are reigning supreme costing the invaluable lives and properties of the inno- cent in hundreds, now and then, in various parts of the country. The most unfortunate climax of these is the cruel and ghastly assasination of our Prime Minister Smt. Indira Gandhi who incessantly appealed to the people and worked for the unity of Bharata throughout her tenure at the hands of the miscreants affected by narrow but deadly thought that were perhaps deemed as an ideal. We have not yet overcome from the severe shock and sorrow at this irrecoverable national loss. Thoughtful and farsighted nationalists and soter people who are much concerned with not only the present but also the future of the country are very much pained at heart at these dreadful developments, especially since . independece. 2.3 It is, therefore, a prime and urgent necessity that not only the intellectuals at the helm of national affairs but also the common people throughout work out effective solution to efface completely the situation which, otherwise, will foil all our efforts at elevating the nation to glorious heights, scientifically, economically and culturally and, nay, endanger the very existence of the nation. ni Efforts in progrese ?A In this important endeavour we have to find out factors responsible for this ugly and treacherous situation. Once we know the factors-there are many-we may probably be able to formulate ways and means of putting an end Co it. It is true that efforts are being made over many years in many fields by making our country secular, trying to bring social equality and to root out casteism. But success to the desired level has not been achieved. For, it seems, our narrow łoyaltieś to our religions, region and language and caste barriers which emerged, perhaps owing to certain historical conditions at some periods, are too strong. Thìse are being exploited by a few but powerful selfish individuais fór</page><page sequence="3">847 tfheir personal advantage and for the benefit of their groups. Historians* social scientists, political leaders, religious thinkers will have to work hand-in-,hand to co-ordinate their efforts for achieving harmony in these fields. We as Historians in the broad sense of the term should have to examine and analyse the situation against the historical spectrum. 3.2 Some of the factors for the present situation are the narrow and partial knowledge or misunderstanding of our cultural and political history and ignorance about our cultural achievements, as «vident in our heritage, that can inspire and provide models to emulate for greater achievements, national harmony and unity. It is here that archaeology of the historical period can be pressed for this essential service. IV Our heritage 4.1 Even from the earliest times our country has been the home of several communities, cultures and people speaking different languages and dialects But for the tribal skirmishes, oh the whole our people did appreciate cultural complexities that are deemed as the unique characte- ristics of the land they were living in. The "Bhumi Sukta" of the Atharva Veda (XII.I) is an eloquent instance. Let your hills and snowy mountains and your forest be pleasant, O earth ! On the earth , brown . black , red , and multiform firm and extended , by Indra defended , I have stood unconquered, uns mit ten, uninjured . What is your middle , O earth , whit your naveU what refreshments arose out of your body , Instai us in them and be towards us gracious ; Earth is the mother , and I am her son ; Parjanya is the father , may he grant us plenty. May the earth bearing peoples of various speeches and of customs varying according to their homes , Grant me wealth in a thousand streams like a steadfast and unresisting milch-cow. What villages , what forests , what assemblies are on the earth , What congregations and councils , there may we speak in praise of you.</page><page sequence="4">848 4.2 Probably it is these and such other noble and sublime ideas of our ancient people that prompted them to conceive Vasudha eva Kutumba- kam, Sarve Janah Sukhino bhavantu. Perhaps, from these angles, even national patriotism may look narrow and today we are feeling the necessity of bringing world order especially in the face of proliferation of the nuclear weapons. It is with this exemplary heritage that even an ambitious monarch like Asoka, after his victorious but bloody Kalinga war, realised the complexities for his vast empire like the Vedic rishi «nd therefore undertook during the rest of his life ''Dhammayatra" in place of Vijayayatra but not at the cost of the security of the empire. He preached " Samavaya eva Sadhu " (i.e., Sincere devotion to one's own religion and respect for other religions and abidance of high praise about one's own religion and of talking ill or low of other religions) rightly, although personally a Buddhist. His was a practical wisdom, a very rare noble example, if not unique in history. Kanishka, the Kushana king, an Indianised outsider as is known very well, again another devout Buddhist, tried to achieve religious harmony remarkably evident in the representations of the gods of different faiths on his coins. Harsha, the king of Kanauj (eariy 7th C.) is another such example. Most of the rulers in the Deccan and the South, irrespective of their personal religious affiliations, were no exception to this deep rooted tradition and were benevolent barring a few occasional erratics. A few of the Muslim rulers like Akbar and Ibrahim Ali Adi Shah are too well known for their broad and rational outlook in attempting to evolve one religion by integrating the best of all the religions prevalent then in India. 4.3 Apart from the rules, the religious sages and mystics through the ages had been preaching the universality of the basic principles of the différent religions ( Ekam Sat Viprah bahudha Vadanti-Devaru Obbane nama halavu) and trying to forge coherence among the followers of different sects. Shankaracharya, although he attacked the Buddhists, the Jains, the Kapalikas, etc., at the metaphysical level, achieved some success in bringing together the Saivas, the Vaishnavas, the Ganapatyas, the Sauras, the Saktas and the Skandas warring at one another, and advocated worship of all gods with the personal god, i.e., Siva or Vishnu, etc., as the principal. He is popularly described as Sanmatasthapana- charya.</page><page sequence="5">849 4.4 In Karnataka, on the social plane, Basavesvara's (c. 12th C.) sincere and practical attempts are remarkable. He tried the utmost to bring together practically people of different castes, especially of the lower strata, on the footing of social equality. Perhaps he was too ahead of his age, Saranas of the Veerasaiva sect and Vaisnava Dasas appealed through their heart rending poems the universal human values, severely criticising the caste system, a historical accidence,- and oneness of the different peoples, Kanakadasa, a shephered was accepted as an enlightened mystic by Sri Vyasaraya a Madhva Pontiff of Sosale Matha well-known in those days. Even the average common Muslim mystics through their touching and terse verse preached universality of the religions. Sherif Saheb from Savanur near Hubli of the quite recent period, an ordinary illiterate Muslim and disciple of Govind Bhatta of the locality, turned a mystic philosopher. His poems are highly symbor lie in Indian philosophical style. One of the close associates of Madhura Chenna (Halasangi Chennappa), a Muslim composed devotional poems on the God Siva. I had seen in a village, Indi Taluk, Bijapur District, a Lakshmi temple constructed by a Muslim. 4.5 In the day-to day life of the common people, especially in the rural areas, religious harmony and social solidarity vsere achieved in a very natural way. In some important religious centres and piligrimuges people of different communities, who, otherwise, are adversaries in their religious metaphysical disputes, co-operatively run the worship and administration in such places. For example, in Dharmasthala, a celeb- rated piligrimage, the presiding Saiva deity is Manjunatheswara (perhaps a syncretic Saiva-Buddh'st god). The principal priesļ is a Madhva and the Dharamadhikari of the temple administration is a Jaina Sri Veeren- dra Hegde. 4.6 In religious festivals, though led by the people of higher levels in villages, members of different communities of lower levels have each specific function in the organisation of community festival whether it is a special puja or rathotsava. In fact it is a dignified privileģē of the communities to do the respective functions and without them the func- tions cannot be carried on. Similarly even in the celebrations of marria- ges etc., in the individual families of higher levels, members of the lower communities, say for playing nagaswara etc., will have to be invited and, after their functions, they have to be remunerated not in a businees style</page><page sequence="6">850 but with honour. This is largely among the communities within the Hindu fold. This apart, communities absolutely distinct from one another e . g., the Hindu and the Muslim, the former freely participated in the festivals of the latter like Muharram and in villages a Hindu had to be invited by the Muslim to begin their festival. The Christians in Kerala joyfully participate in the essentially Hindu festival i. e Onam. It is these and other attempts and consequently the way of living by kings, sages and common people through the ages that kept united the numerous and distinctly diverse communities, who were taught from time to time to root out the artificial social barriers and inferior comp- lexes. V Certain present approaches 5.1 In spite of the unspeakable generel ignorance, ecanomic disparity, social barriers sometimes amounting to injustice to the human prosperity* decent living did exist in the society. What is, therefore, needed is a judicious, farsighted approach to these problems such as the removal öf caste barriers, social injustice and economic disparity as the ancient thoughtful people did in a small measure empirically in the given social set up. But the attempts and approaches since Independence, have been to a considerable extent, unknowingly unhealthy. The so called average social or political leader, at different levels, without fight knowledge and correct understanding of the past and the present, and being unaware of the possible consequences went on impressing the people of the lower levels that for all their ills and miserable conditions certain communities of higher level were responsible. Extracts torn out of their context from the anient shastras and kavyas, without comprehension of the entire lore and a sober understanding, nay, more dangerously, in the light of the theories and principles of modern isms, were indiscrimina- tely construed as perpetuating superiority of and favouritism to certain higher castes, and suppression of the others and denial of opportunities to them, although the very same ancient lores do, repeatedly with exam-* pies, speak of the character and utility of a person to a society that decide his/her social status and dignity and not birth. Such values are perhaps conveniently ignored. Consequently their indiscriminate haran- gues, that are incessantly dinned into the ears of the people, amounted</page><page sequence="7">85 i to a short lived emotional sympathy on the public platform that fanned hatred and distrust among the people of lower strata towards the other communities and indiscriminate dislike even for the eternal noble cultu- ral values that our country cherished since long, and heritage instead of generating competitive spirit and attitude and making to work themsel- ves vigarously for their upliftment. There were a few enlightened like Dr. Ambedkar and Dr. Narasimhaiah, the former Vice-Chancellor of Bangalore University, who were judicious in criticising the deep rooted irrelevant and unwanted wrong notions, beliefs and practices resulting in social injustice and inequalities, but never at the cost of one commu- nity or the other. In fact they did appreciate the good of any commu- nity, high or low. 5.2 But, to-day, social forces therefore, that are let out by the inadver- tant and selfish, without rhyme or reason are practically uncontrollable. Besides, the continuing imperialistic interpretations of our cultural her- itage, art, literature and religion and indiscriminate applications of the so-called scientific disciplines in their study have shaken the very faith in the powerful unifying factor of the noble national values and conse- quently the integration of the nation. 5.3 The need of the hour, therefore, is to resurrect the glorious cultural valuse and examples of the Vedic and Non-Vedic traditions and litera ture through the ages from the present muddle and brainwashing, that may again inspire mutual understanding and unity among the people of diverse communities. For it is rapidly, but definitely, realised that not only the enlightened intellectuals of our past like the Vedic Rishis Buddha, Acharyas Basavesvara and Vivekananda but also the wise mature common folk did contribute, as evident in their folk songs and stories, shrines and rituals and in creative art, their share to the fabric and structure of Indian culture. And there was a harmonioua amalga- mation of the cultural concepts from the Vedic and Non-Vedic tradi tions of different communities into new healthy and beautiful forms, as evident in the religious cults of Medieval India. 5.4 A day has come that every community in India can take pridç in fact that it has its role and share in the development of Indian Culture and can be benefited immensely by knowing and adopting of certain useful value systems of the other?. This has to be emphatically and</page><page sequence="8">852 strikingly impressed upon the average common folk. It is io this contex that it may be inquired what role Historical Archaeology has in promo- ting right and healthy understanding and integrity among the people of our nation. Our study of archaeology should not be merely to satisfy our intellectual curiosity. VI Archaeology as a means 6.1 Historical Archaeology in the broad sense of the term is resolved into four branches : City/Village sites, Monuments, Epigraphy and Numismatics. Let me attempt how especially the monuments eloquently speak of the cultural movements and integration through the ages with some appropriate illustrations particularly from Karnataka with which I am familiar. 6.2 Among these archaeological relics, the monuments are readily and directly the most striking and impressive because of their aesthetic visual forms that could be easily appreciated even by the average. They are therefore dîalt with here below in far more detail than the epigraphical and numismatic remains. VII The Cultural heritage : prehistoric 7.1 Archaeological explorations and excavations in Karnataka in the major river valleys ; the Kaveri, the Tungabhadra (including the Bhadra and the Tunga valleys prior to their confluence) a tributary to the Krishna, the Krishna and her other tributaries ; the Malaprabha, the Ghataprabha and the Bhima, the Manjra with her tributary the Karanja covering practically the whole of the region excluding the coastal belt, have revealed that it was the habitat of the people densely from a very remote past, i.e., from the Early Palaeolithic stage Numer- ous sites-a large number of them in the Krishna valley and her tributaries were discovered by me as an official of the Archaeological Survey of India, as a Ph-D. Research Scholar and as University teacher - the Early Palaeolithic, the Mesolithic, the Neolithic, the Chalcolithic, the Iron Ags Megalithic, the Early Historical, the Historicnl in all these</page><page sequence="9">853 river valleys and hill ranges. A few of the promising sites such as Maski* Tekkalakota, Brahmagiri, T. Naiasipura etc., in the Krishna-Tungabha* dra and Kaveri valleys have been, on a small scale, excavated. A clear stratigraphie sequence, overlaps, distincts traits of especially the Neoli- thic/Cbalcolithic, Iron Age Megalithic and Early historical cultures, as well as some of the aspects of lives of the peoples of these cultures and their dates are ascertained. A careful analysis of the material cultural remains of these various cultures through the ages c'early exhibits cultural movements, contacts and influences. For example, the pebble tool tradition that is common more in southern part of Andhra Pradesh, e. g., Nagarjunakor.da, finds its extension into the mid eastern part of Karnataka, as for instance Nittur (Bellary District). Besides, in this site a few chopper chopping tools, a common cultural characteristic of the Early Palaeolithic in the north-western part of Indo-Pakistan sub- continent have been identified. The Middle Palaeolithic of the northern Karnataka (type site Salvadgi, Muddebihal taluk, Bijapur District) is a part of the Middle Palaeolithic cultural zone in the Deccan. The geographical extension of the late Jorwe chalcolithic culture has been traced along the Bhima valley in Karnataka and as far south as Brahma- giri, The painted pottery of the chalcolilhic cultural sites in the upper Krishna clearly indicate the difTusion of the influence of the Harappan culture, as far as this valley. The neolithic culture (in the Chalcolithic stage) in the Middle Krishna valley is akin to a considerable extent to that in Andhra Pradesh, e. g ., Singanapalle. The neolithic culture of the Kaveri valley shares some oí its traits with those of the North Arcot area of Tamilnadu. Strikingly enough, the Megalithic port-hole chamber and the oblong cist traditions were spread over a very wide area covering adjacent parts of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil- nadu. Besides, e'ear overlap between the Neolithic and the Megalithic and, in turn, the Megalihic and the Early historical, has been evident in most of the excavated sites. 7.2 From the above examples four important points are particularly noteworthy for the present study : the cultural movements, overlap, interimngling of one culture with the other and then the varying cultural zones in the successive cultural stages in the Deccan including Karnataka.</page><page sequence="10">854 VIII Historical : monuments and sculpture 8.1 Even after the beginning of writing, emergence of political order and organised trade and commerce characterised by the use of coins as token of exchange, the process of cultural diffusion from one to other regions continued, but with some difference. In the prehistoric periods it was more or less the community movement responsible for the cultural dynamics. But in the historical period the movement was also of gifted persons such as artists, literary figures and organised traders seeking their fortune and worthy patronage from one city to a more prosperous city or capital of a Kingdom. Poets, artists, etc., migrated in search of benevolent patrons and conversely kings were vying with one another to patronise great intellectuals in their court and for their works. Such historical situation provided tremendous impetus for the interaction of higher cultural values and forms. During the Satavahana rule in the D:ccan Amaravathi (Andhra Pradesh)-- Sannati (Gulbarga District, Karnataka) region formed a great centre of distinct art tradition gene- rally described as the Amaravati Schools of Art , like the Mathura and Gandhara schools in the Central and North-western regions of Indo- Pakistan sub-continent. The Buddhist sculptures such as Vajrasana Muchulinda Naga, relic casket and the bas-reliefs representing the main episodes in Buddha's life, memorial stones from Sannati are intimately similar in theme, characteristics, style and even the rock material use J to those from Amaravati region formed a distinct cultural zone during lst-3rd Century A. D., in the Andhra-Karnataka. Similarly the Buddha images from Aihole, Babrawada near Ankola and Haigunda (both in Uttara Kannada District) as well as Maitreya from Banavasi and also the colossal Yaksha from Haigunda (all discovered by me) are more akin in style, characteristics and forms to those of the Western Deccan like Ajanta, Ellora, etc. These sculptures range in date from 2nd to 5th Cen. A. D. Some other early sculptures recently noticed by me such as dvibhuja Vishnu from Kontapala (Uttara Kannada), seated dvidhuja Narasimha from Halashi (Belgaum District), Kargal (Uttara Kannada District), Kupputuru (Shimogu District) as well as Harihara from Harihara and Gokarna are typical of pre-Gupta and Gupta styles. Especially the dvibhuja Narasimha from Karnataka is similar iconographically and in style to that from Ramtek (Vidarbha</page><page sequence="11">855 region). Similarly the chaturbhuja Vishnu of 5th Cen. A. D. from San- dur (Bellary District) is again of Central Indian type. Thus during 2nd- 5th Cen. A. D., north-Karanataka, Deccan and Central India seem to be as if one cultural zone where certain common art traditions were prevalent. It is in this context that it may be recalled that the Kadamba and the Gupta kings had matrimonial alliance as known frcm the Talagunda inscription of the early Kadamba King Santivarma. Of late the M-jdigere copper plates of the early Kadamba Kings Vishnu- varma and Simhavarma seem to indicate the good political relationship between the Vakaîakas and the collateral branch of the early Kadambas. Sarvasena Maharaja (perhaps a later king of the Vakataka line) coro- nated Simhavarma, the Kadamba king of the collateral branch accord- ing to these plates. Thus the political conditions too were favourable for the cultural movements. Not much is known about the sculptural art of this period in the southern Karnataka. However, as in the later times southern Karnataka and Tamilnadu must have had fruitful cultural relationships. Further investigation in detail is necessary in this matter. 8.2 The early Chalukyan period is still more strikingly brilliant and impressive in the cultural contacts and fusion. Badami -Pattadakal- Aihole is rightly considered as the laboratory of Indian temples. This is the only region in India where the most popular and widely spread distinct temple styles, that is the Rekha-Nagara or the Indo-Aryan or the Northern" and the "Dravida Vimana or the Dravidiau or the Southern" exist side by side. Badami-Pattadakal is the focal centre of the Vimana style of temple architecture. Here the developmental stages of the style can be recogaised in the temples : Upper and^ lower Sivalayas, the Mallikarjuna and the Mahakutesvara, the Sangames^ara and the Virupaksa (6th- 8th Cen. A.D.). Indeed they can very gocd text book examples. Likewise Aihole-Pattadakal is the focal centre of the temples of the Rekha-Nagara style, as adumbrated in the temples ; the Hucchhappaiah temple, the Tarabasappa temple (both in Aihole), the Jambulinga, the Kadasiddesvara and the Kasivisveswara (all in Pattadakal). Alampur near Kurnool (Andhra Pradesh) is anoiher remarkable temple site. As in Pattadakal, here are eleven temples and excepting one (Taraka Brahma) all are in Rekha Nagara style, slightly different in ground plan and also in the elevational aspect of the garbla -</page><page sequence="12">856 griha excluding the sikhara from those of Aihole, Pattadakal. Usually the garbhagriha &gt; the sabhamandapa , and the mukhamandapa are raised on an extensive platform providing enough space to go round the temple proper. And on the three sides of the outer wall round the garbhagriha corresponding to the Devakosthas on the exterior walls of the garbhagriha are ghanadvaras enclosing life size sculptures of Siva in various forms, such as Andhakasurari, Nataraja etc. In Pattadakal the Galaganatha temple of ihe Rekha-Nagara style is almost similar in ground-plan and elevation to Virabrahma or Kumara Brahma temples of Alampur. Pattadakal and Alampur forms therefore a region where a particular Rekha-Nagara styl« of temple architecture prevailed and at the same time Pattadakal is the meeting ground of the temple style of the north and the south. Nay, here the architect tried successfully to amalgamate certain north Indian and south Indian features into the Vimarta style of architecture. The integration of the Sukanasa into frontal side of the lower talus of the super structure of the temple of the Vimana style and the location of the Ganesha and the Durga subshrines in the Sabhaman - tapa near the garbhagriha respectively illustrate the harmonious blending of the architectural elements of the north and the south Indian temple forms An intelligent art student would not fail to recognise the late Gupta influence in the iconographie traits in the sculpture of Siva and Vishnu in the devakostas of Malegitti Sivalaya and also in the Saiva layana both in Badami. Similarly the sculptures in the devakostas of the Durga temple exhibits strong north Indian influence in style. The apodal Siva temple in Halemahakuta and the apsidal Siva temple and Durga (=Fort) temple (originally dedicated to Sur) a) in Aihole are the clear illustrations of the survival of once a very popular temple form commonly adopted among the rival religious sects, the Brahmnical and the Budhist, over a wi le area right from 1st 2nd Cen. A.D. For instance the apsidal brick religious structures of 1 st- 3rd Cen. A.D. have been discovered in the excavations in Mathura, Nagarjunakonda (Andhra Pradesh), Banavasi, Brahmagiri. Even certain pillar form for example the pillars of Ambigeri (originally Surya' temple in Aihole are exactly similar to those of the apsidal Buddhist Chaityalaya near the Mahastupa in Sanchi. Although the political relationship between the Badami Chalukyas and the Paliavas was hostile during the period of Pulakesin (II) and Narasimhavarman Mamalla and slightly later, in the cultural field the relationship was remarkably fruitful. If the cult of Ganesla</page><page sequence="13">857 had diffused from Karnataka through Pandya to Paliava region during this period, the Virupaksha temple in Pattadakal seems to be owing to the inspiration that Vikramaditya (II) had after his magnanimous visit to the Kaildsanatha temple in Kanchi. In the southern Karnataka a few temples of the Ganga and the Nolambas for example at Manne and Aralaguppe seem to share the tradition prevalent in the southern region. 8.3 The next period, i.e., the Rastrakuta rule is equally important in such cultural conacts and amalgamations. In the beginning their centre of activity was near Ellora and later was transferred to Malkhed (Gvlburga District). Krishna (III) had successful campaigns in Tamil- nadu area. Politicaliy the Rastrakuta empire included Maharastra, Karnataka, parts of Tamilnadu and Andhra-Pradesh. But the survival of the Rastrakuta enterprises in the field of art and architecture are traced mostly in the Ellora region. The gigantic monolithic temple that is Kailasa in Ellora is unique in the sense that it seems to represent the best of the regional cultures in Karnataka-Maharashtra-Tamilnadu area fused imaginatively so well that it represents as if the quintessence of the Indian culture in temple art. Of course in Karnataka proper the Rashtrakuta monuments have note yet come to light. But there are many structural temples of the Rashtrakuta period that had come to light recently. Of them the Traipurushh Devalayas are found in consi* derable number in northern Karnataka, The temple in ruins in Belur near Badami and the Brahmeswara temple in Savadi (Ron Taluk, Dharwad District) are the typical examples extant. In these temples in the garrbhagriha on an oblong pitha are the sculptures of Brahma and Vishnu and also Siva in the anthropomorphic form that would bring together the followers of the Saiva, the Vaishnava and the Brahma on the one hand and indicate that these gods are but the different forms of one god echoing "Eham sad Viprah bahuaha vidanti " on the other. In facj the earliest attempt made in this regard was by the Badami Chalu- kyan King Vinayaditpa (695-733) who got constructed a temple (now called the J.wnbułinga) dedicated to Brahma, Siva and Vishnu in Badami, the earliest Trikuta form of temple. It appears as though that concrete expression was given to the attempt of uniting the adherents of different sects by Shankaracharya in visual art form. The Trivikrama sculpture from Adakesvara themple of late Rashtrakuta dear Hosama- hakuta is in the Central Indian style. Similarly a few sculptures of</page><page sequence="14">858 Vishnu and Surya in Sandur of this period are again of Central Indian types. These indicate that there was a school of northern Indian sculptural tradition in north Karnataka that began quite earl} as evident in the Vishnu sculpture of 5th Cen. A. D. referred to above. The Panchakuta Basadi of the Ganga period, /. e„ late 9th C. in Kambada- halli (Nagamangala Taluk, Mandya District) is a typical text book illustrative example of what technically is meant by Dravida, Nagara and Vesara according to the South Indian South Indian shilpa texts. The Panchakuta Basadi consists of actually two basadis : the Dvikutachala and the Trikuiachala. The three super structures of the Trikuiachala have variously the square, the octagonal and the circular stupies. In the south almost invariably the temple is in the Dravida Vimana style wherein the stupi is octagonal. The temples and the sculptures on their walls in the southern Karnataka and other places are typical of the deep South. For example the Bhoga Nandisvara (of late Ganga period) at the foot of the Nandi hills both in architecture and sculptural art is like any other temple in Tamlnadu and these temples are built in granite. 8.4 In the succeeding period that is the Kalyana Chalukya a bold attempt was made in completely fusing the Indian temple styles: the Rekha-Nagara and the Vimana. One of the distinctive features of ihe Rekha-Nagara style is the emphasis on vertically and of the Vimana , the horizontality. These two are fused so well that a new form of super- structure was evolved where both the features are distinctly striking indeed the most splendid symbol of the fusion of the north and the south Indian traditions. In art history this style is described as the Chalukyan style by Cousens, and Vesara (mishra) traditionally. Besides this bold attempt, temples typically of Rekha-Nagara style were continued to be built in Karnataka for example the temples in Umrani (Bidar District), in Hattargi (Belgaum District), Ernal (Sindgi Taluka, Bijapur District), Sirur (Bagalkot taluk, Bijapur District), Ganesha temple in Hangal (Dharwad District). These temples excepting the Ganesha are of eka, da type of the Rekha-Nagara style. The Ganesha is of anekan la type of the style. Around 8th-9the Cen. another temple st)le, z', e the Bhumija was developed in Gujarat-Madhya Pradesh. A little later, this form also finds its home in Karnataka, e. the Sadasiva temple in Nugge- halli and Mule-Sankareswara temple in Turuvekere. Temples of late</page><page sequence="15">859 12th- 13th Cen. A. D. in Bijapur (many of them in the northern part of the district were surveyed by me) and Bidar districts in architecture and sculptural features are more akin to those of Hemad, panti, (/. e . Hemadri, Minister to Seuna Mahadeva 1261 1271, a prolific writer on temple architecture in his encyclopaedic work : Chaturvarga Chintumani) style as popularly known in Maharashtra. A sculpture of Vishnu with Lakshmi sealed on Garuda from Basavakalyana again of 12th Cen. A.D. is in central Indian style. In fact northern Karnataka was under the Sevunas for sometime immediately after the decline of the Kalyana Chalukyas. 8.5 The Hoysalas continued the Chalukya tradition with some innova- tions. Provision of Jagati , adoption stellate plan, the multiple horizontal taras (Gaja tara, asva tara f etc.) in the place of adhisthana etc. The temples are characterised by rich delicate and ornate carvings and he ivily hardened with sculptures. During this period there appears to b; tremendous impact of the religions tradition of the deep south. The stories of the Vaisnava and Saiva devotees Aivars and the Nayanars from Tamilnadu gradually were becoming popular in southern Karna- taka. And in the subsequent period, the Vijayanagara their impact on temple sculptural art is simply tremendous. It may bs noted here that the temples of the preceding Hoysala period are built in schist stone and those of the preceding Kalyana Chalukya period, of either dolerite or Deccan trap. In the deep south fiora the Chola period onwards granite becomes the invariable rock material for temple construction. In the Vijayanagara period in Karnataka, right from the beginning there is a sudden deviation from the preceding tradition in the use of the rock material for temple construction. As in the deep south granite is almost invariavbly used. The change is obviously due to the topography of the region of the Vijayanagara capital city marked with granite hills and valleys. As a result of the choice of the rock materials, architects and iculptors adept in working on granite, had to be preferred to those skilled in working on schist. Architects and sculptors of the southern part which was^ part of their kingdom, therefore, must have been invited. This situation has its impact on the temple architecture and sculpture. The temple architecture particularly the cdhistana , the wall features, the pillars, the super structure are typical of the late Chola style. The Krishna temple recently conserved by the Directorate of</page><page sequence="16">860 Archaeology and Museums in Karnataka and the Saiva temple group on the hillock near the Virupaksha temple generally supposed to be Jaina on the one hand, the Krishna, theVittala, the Achyuta temples on the other are the illustrative examples in these regards. Separate shrines were built for Devi, Lakshmi or Parvathi, a practice that is common in Tamilnadu. Also for Aivars separate shrines were built. Beside the Vitthala temple there is a shrine for the Aivars according to an inscrip- tion there. In the Saiva, Vaishnava temples some important episcdes from the lives of the Nayanars and the Aivars are represeeted on the walls and sculptural traditions of southern India, dominated the archi- tectural and sculptural activities in Karnataka. Conversely in these respects in southern India the temples and the sculptures of this period might have been enriched with some of the traits distinctive of the Karnataka region. This aspect needs thorough examination. 8.6 A very important and unusual development during this period is the fusion of the architectural traditions of the Islamic and Hindu. In Hampi, the Kamala Mahal, the Rani bath, the Gaja Shala , the super- structure on the gateways with their arches and domes represent the fusion. Many of the temples of 16th-18ih Cen. A.D. built in north Karnataka ruled by the Vijayanagara have arched facade, minarets and domes and they are of ashlar masonry with mortar as the buiding material, a common feature of the Islamic architecture of the Adii Shahis. IX A Review 9.1 I have here tried to point out the share in the art heritage of Kar- nataka of the gifted people and traditions of the other regions in India. Artists of Karnataka region no doubt have their major share in it as known from the names of some artists of the Kalyana Chalukya and Hoysala periods (e.g., Dasoja of Balligava, etc.). But certainly the abundance, the varieties aud innovations, the richness and the beauty of the Karnataka art tradition from the earliest till the recent times are due to not only the Karnataka artists, but also the others of different regions in India in no less measure, if we describe this art as Karna- taka art it simply implies that art in the Karnataka region for the sake</page><page sequence="17">861 of convenience of the study of history of Art. The art is really symbolic of Indian art. And the Kannadigas should feel proud of this represen- tative Indian heritage and gratefully honour with love the people of the other regions for enriching the art in their region. 9.2 The other regions are no exception to such historical developments Traditions and values of one region must have found expressions i some form in the other regions. For instance, the famous excavate^ granite Tiger's cave (7th Cen.) in Mahabalipuram (Tamilnadu) is a fine reproduction of a similar cave of c. 1st C* B.C. in the Jaina Vihara Group of caves in Udayagiri-Khandagiri (Oriss), both being located in the coastal belt, evidently owing to the diffusion of the art motifs from the Orissan region to that of Tamilnadu. What is needed therefore is to highlight such distinct art from and motifs of all the regions to instill among the people a broad generous vision and feeling of oneness. And the regional divisions are artificial and were never constant in the past. They indicate only the area where majority of people speak particular languages, having particular modes of dress, customs, food habits due to environmental conditions. However, the people of all the regions aie culturally one. These are corroborrated even by epigraphical and numi- smatic evidences as well. X Other cultural relics 10.1 Epigraphical remains displyaing religious harmony through the ages are too numerous for illustrations. Most of the rulers irrespective of their personal religion had been liberal in their attitude and meritoiious acts towards the people of other sects. It is all the more remarkable to note that a victorious king behaved magnanimously towards the religious edifices in the capital of the conquered. The Badami Chalukya king Vikramaditya II (733-745) after his conquest of Kanchi the Capital of their arch enemies the Pallava, was remarkably impressed at the immense wealth of the Kailasanatha temple there. Instead of plunde- ring it, he ordered to return it to the temple and that the temple should be maintained well with it, And the inscription recording his order in Kannada language is on one of the pillars of the temple about which both the Kannadigas and the Tamilians must be proud of. Here it</page><page sequence="18">862 should be noted the Paliava King was of course his enemy. But the temple in the enemy's land represent the Indian concepts and traditions which both the kings have inherited and value them with reverence. At least in these respects they are one. Some of the rulers and donors in Karnataka with a pride bore the title k Chatuh-Samayah,' I.e., respectful to Siva, Vishnu, Jina and Buddha. An inscription from Kaidala (Tumkur District) invokes Siva, Vishnu, Jina and Buddha in the invo- catory verse. 10.2 The well-known Sravanabelagr la infcription of the time of Bukkaraya (F) the Vijayanagara King, speaks of the compromise that the King brought between the quarrel ir g Sri Vaisnavas and the Jainas and his genuine appeal in this context is worthy of note. 10.3 While most of the kings of the successive ruling dynasties had been benevolent in their treatment towards the people of different religious sects even the individuals had been tolerent towards the other members being different in religion within the family or outside. For example, the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana personally was, it appears, a staunch devo'ee of Vishnu ; but his beloved queen Stiantala was a devotee of both Siva and Jina. She was worshiping Girija the consort of Siva and her father Marasingamayya was a Haribhakta. Ahmadkhan, a Muslim, probably an officer in the court of the Vijayanagara king, Devaraya II, got builts a dharmasala for the merit of his Hindu master. Instance of this kind are numerous. What was therefore desired by Asoka the Mauryan emperor, that is "Samavaya Eva saadhu", some 2300 years ago was practically followed by the people as well as the rulers through the ages. Thus the most cherished religious tolerance was practised to a very great extent in the past till recently. Even the Muslim rulers in general did maintain this Indian tradition. For instance one of the types of coins issued by Hyder Ali (1761-1782) of old Mysore State, who practically ruled the kingdom in the name of his master, Krishnaraja Wadiyar (il), carried his initials on one side and representation of Siva and Parvathi or seated Vishnu on the other. His son Tippu Sultan (1782-1799) succeeding him is said to be somewhat rigid in his religious attitude. Yet he had been reverential towards Sri Ranganatha temple in the capital Srirangapama, the Nanjundeshwaia temple in Nanjangud and also to His Holiness of the Sringeri Matha. There are inscriptions and records to this effect.</page><page sequence="19">863 10.4 Similarly in the other branches of the study, such as lite-ature and religion, there is a lot of the above kind that can bring right understan- ding and promote unity among the people when projected properh and objectively. Thus in every rigion in our nation there are many things of high standard and beauty created by the people of the other regions and for the people of the entire nation in literature, art, religion, etc. 10.5 It is said that Santa Jnanadev of Maharashtra has expressed the strong and deep impact of the Kannada on Marathi. Rabindranath Tagore of Bengal is a national poet. And Mahatma Gandhi is a world personality. Vedic Rishis, Jesus Christ, Mohammud, the Prophet, do not belong to particular communities. While they practised and preached they had the entire humanity in their view and heart. Historical evidences should highlight such instances for the average public under- standing. Xl Observations 11. 1 From the above survey of the historical evidences certain points are quite clear. The religious tolerence among the rulers and the ruled of various communities and sects is a very distinctive character of the Indian culture and part of the Indian tradition throughout the ages. Inspite of the social inequalities and economic disparities that were prevalent till recently, continuous attempts ware made to achieve social harmony in the societies. With this long healthy heritage, it would not therefore be impossible to achieve and strengthen religious harmony and social solidarity in a way that is required in the present context by sober understanding of the reasons and situations causing dispues and fights among the peoples of various communities and sections as discussed in the first few paras of this address. The question is how to achieve the goal ? Here again Ashoka has a practical solution for such problems. He did not simply preach ''Samavpya". He personally visited different places of his empire actually, personally had discussions with pc op'es of various sections for the promotion of the ethical and moral standards of the society and appealed to the people frequently to practice the most simple and the basic ethical values. Such practices would sublimate the passionate and emotional narrow feelings of the people and widen their outlook, for betterment of the individuals and society. If we care</page><page sequence="20">864 to note this valuable example from the history, we can devise similar means of achieving the goal. 1 1.2 Highlighting incorrectly the actions and values of the people of the past under given circumstances as social or economic blunders or social injustice to-day to the people practically do more harm than good. In fact it has created enough bad blood in the people as our present bitter experience shows. What appear to be blunders of the people of the past are to be recorded in history as a caution to the present so that the people may become wise and not for average public consumption generating hatred etc. On the other hand it is the good of every community of the past and present as discussed above that promotes mutual love, understanding and brotherly binding among the people and elevates them from casteism, regionalism etc. (And I am afraid we with rich experience and knowledge are not free from committing blunders, may be of different sort, that may be pointed out by the posterity). XII Suggestions 120l I may suggest here that in our educational field right from the primary level upto the last year of the Pre-University Course there should be regular and continuous instructions in our noble cultural values and heritage with examples of the types given above as also from various branches of religion, literature and art to students of all commu- nities, etc., to make them appreciate such values, emulate similar examples and develop mutual understanding and respect by the time th?y become responsible citizens of the country. Increase in periodical lectures, speeches, publications of books and advertisements to the people at large through mass media will have considerable effect on them. 12.2 It is, therefore, the duty of every Archaeologist and Historian not merely to use the evidence just for the reconstruction of the historical narrative but aho to emphasise boldly the noble examples that may guide the society and the people to find out the right way of living and for the benefit of all. If this right type of education is given nationwide, probably National Integration will not be theoiy but a reality.</page></plain_text>
