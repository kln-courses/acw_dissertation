Melvin Automotive Safety and Health Research General Motors Research and Development Center ABSTRACT The purpose of this paper is to establish injury assessment reference values specific to the CRABI 6- Month infant dummy for use in evaluating the interac- tion of rear-facing infant restraints with a deploying passenger airbag. The available literature on the biomechanics of child Injury and mechanical response and the results of impact tests with various child and infant dummies are reviewed and summarized. Estimations of the injury assessment reference values for use with the CRABI 6-Month dummy are made using scaling techniques based on the principles of dimensional analysis and dummy test data from infant restraint tests under conditions where injuries are not likely to occur. The information developed in this report will allow the assessment of injury potential in tests of the interaction of passenger airbags with rear-facing infant restraints. This issue is of particular Importance to vehicles with only front seats, such as pickup trucks and sport vehicles. INTRODUCTION The Introduction of passenger airbags in automo- biles has created a dilemma for the restraint of infants in the front seats of those cars. The only effective restraint of infants up to one year old and less than 20 lbs is by rear-facing infant restraints. This is because, in a frontal crash, the undeveloped skeleton of the infant is not suited to carrying the belt restraint loads and the loads generated on the neck by the head in forward-facing restraint systems. Rear-facing restraints distribute frontal crash deceleration loads over the back of the Infant and support the head. However, the very nature of rear-facing infant restraints, when used in the front seat, places the infant and the restraint directly in the path of the passenger airbag while it is still inflating. One solution, of course, is to place the Infant restraint svstem in the rear seat. However, this is not possible in vehicles with only front seats, such as pickup trucks and sport vehicles. The question arises, then, as to how to test and evaluate the severity of the interaction of the airbag with the infant restraint and to judge the potential for injury to the infant, so that countermeasures can be developed. The first step in conducting appropriate testing is that of using a dummy of correct size and with sufficient instrumentation to allow injury assessment for the criti- cal body regions, which in this case are the head, neck, and chest. The CRABI (Child Restraint/Airbag Interac- tion) 6-Month dummy was recently developed to fulfill that need (SAE 1991). Although the CRABI 6-Month dummy does not necessarily possess realistic biome- chanical responses, it does have up-to-date instrumen- tation which allows head translational and angular accelerations, neck forces and moments, and chest translational accelerations to be measured. The second critical step is that of using biomechani- cally valid criteria, in the form of injury assessment reference values, for assessing the likelihood of injury. The purpose of this report is to determine injury assessment reference values for use with the CRABI 6-Month dummy. The virtual lack of meaningful blomechanical information on infants makes it neces- sary to use various estimation techniques to achieve this purpose. ANATOMY AND STRUCTURE OF INFANTS The most striking difference between the anatomy of the infant and that of the adult is the relatively large head of the infant in comparison to the rest of its body. At birth the head accounts for almost 30% of the body weight while in the adult it accounts for only about 6% of the body weight. From a mechanical standpoint, the skeletal structure of Infants is comDOsed of bones that are onlv Dartiallv 1553 - . -</page><page sequence="2">developed and ossified. Detailed discussions of skeletal structures of importance to this report follow. HEAD - The skull of an infant is structurally unlike that of an adult not only in terms of its material proper- ties but in its geometric structure as well. This is due to the necessity for the head of an infant to pass through the birth canal of the mother. The flexibility of the skull bones and their loose connections at the sutures (regions where the bones meet) enable the skull to undergo changes of shape (called molding) during birth. There are six large fibrous areas called fontanels which aid in allowing the skull to change shape. Some of these fontanels close within two to three months after birth by growth of the surrounding bones. It is not until the middle of the second year that all the fontanels have closed, however. From a mechanical structure standpoint, the skull of an infant cannot be considered a rigid, closed container. This has significant implications for the ability of the head of an infant to withstand accelera- tions and for the subsequent deformations of the brain resulting from the accelerations. The flexible skull can deform more easily under load than a comparably sized skull with the closed rigid structure of adult bone. In addition, the fontanels allow volume changes of the skull as it is loaded which can lead to large motions of the brain relative to the skull. Such volume changes are significantly reduced or are prevented by the closed skulls of older children and adults. NECK - The vertebrae at birth consist of three sepa- rate bony parts, a body and two lateral parts that constitute the arch, that are joined by hyaline cartilage. The uniting of all parts occurs during the third year in a typical spinal vertebra. The first two cervical vertebrae, the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2), are exceptions and do not complete the union of their parts until the fourth to sixth year. The vertebrae attain almost their full size by puberty, but they are not fully developed until the twenty-fifth year. During infancy the musculature of the neck is not well developed and the average child can- not adequately support the head until about 3 months of age. BIOMECHANICAL INJURY DATA ON CHILDREN None of the child sized crash test dummies currently available in most testing laboratories have biomechani- cally realistic impact response behavior. Because of this fact, and because much of the injury tolerance data for children are derived from tests with dummies rather than direct biomechanical tests, we must make a distinction between the two types of data when determining injury assessment reference values to be used with current dummies. DUMMY-BASED INJURY STUDIES - The first com- prehensive attempt to estimate biomechanical tolerance limits for children used a combination of techniques to overcome the lack of specific experi- mental data (Sturtz, 1980). The methods used by Sturtz to determine biomechanical limits for the head, neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, and lower extremities of children included an extensive review of the literature on the biomechanics of the body and organ systems for adults, scaling of the general information to specific child ages, analysis of field pedestrian accidents, and reconstruction of some of the field accidents with instrumented child dummies. Sturtz defined two levels of injury criteria based on estimated probability of injury. One level, designated SKO, was intended to avoid any irreversible injuries and was based on reversible or minor injuries (AIS=1) only. The second level, designated SK1, was based on 25 per cent probability of irreversible injuries (AIS&gt;2). The results of the analysis for a 6 year old child are shown in Table 1. This information must be scaled to the 6- month infant size before it can be applied to injury as- sessment of airbag/infant restraint interactions. Two studies of passenger airbag inflation-induced injuries to standing child surrogates have produced in- formation related to three-year-old child dummy loads associated with head, neck, and chest injury potentials. Mertz and Weber (1982) conducted an analysis to interpret the significance of response measurements made with a specially instrumented 3-year-old child dummy (GM03XA) that was used to evaluate child in- jury potential of passenger airbag restraint systems. Anesthetized swine and baboons and the child dummy were exposed to similar airbag inflation and simulated collision environments. The conditions were chosen to produce a wide spectrum of animal injury types and severities, and a corresponding broad range of child dummy responses. The animal injury severity ratings were paired with the dummy response values for the head, neck, thorax, and abdomen for each exposure environment. The resulting relationships were used to predict the probability of an animal experiencing significant injuries to those body regions based on the dummy response measurements. The corresponding response values of the 3-year-old child dummy for very low probabilities (&lt;1%) of animal injury were; for the head, HIC &lt;1000, for the neck, axial tension &lt; 1000N, and for the chest, upper spinal acceleration &lt;50G. For neck tension loading they reported an upper limit of 1350 N, at which there was a high probability (&gt;99%) of animal injury. Prasad and Daniel (1984) reported on a similar study using the same test protocol as in the Mertz and Weber study, but with a more detailed analysis of the experimental results. The authors felt that the primary cause of brain stem injuries in the animals was sudden stretch of the neck. They found good agreement with 1554</page><page sequence="3">TABLE 1.

They estimated the combined effect to be linear, with a limit of 2000 N tension with no moment acting and a limit of 34 Nm moment with no tension acting. The 1000 N tension limit would involve a corresponding 17 Nm moment acting at the same time. Since the Mertz and Weber study did not report moments, no comparison could be made, however, the Prasad and Daniel tests produced most of their data in the 15 to 30 Nm moment range which would indicate that such moments typically accompanied axial tensions in the 500 to 2000 N range. The Prasad and Daniel study concluded the 3-year- old dummy HIC and chest acceleration levels generally agreed with the Mertz and Weber data for low probabilities of animal brain and chest injuries at HIC &lt;1000 and upper spinal acceleration &lt;50G. The injury assessment reference values for the three year old child dummy produced by these two studies must be scaled to the 6-month infant before they can be applied to injury assessment of airbag/infant restraint interactions. The rear-facing infant restraint has been found to be a very effective way to protect infants in frontal crashes. Melvin, et al (1980) reported on investiga- tions of the field performance of child restraint systems in actual crashes. Three of the sixteen cases studied involved infants in rear-facing restraints that underwent severe crashes without injury to the infants. The ve- hicles were a 1977 compact car, a 1968 intermediate car and a 1976 large car. In two cases, the restraints were in contact with the instrument panel or contacted them during the crash. As an additional way to obtain information on the level of forces on the infant in such crashes, the CRABI 6-month dummy and a precursor GM/TNO 6-month dummy prototype were used in 30 mph crash simulations. The prototype dummy was assembled by GM from parts of the TNO P 3/4 9- month dummy and used the GM03XA neck and neck load cell. Sled tests were conducted by GM Inland Fisher Guide (SAE 1992) using a passenger car buck with production instrument panels and vehicle seats with current rear-facing infant restraints that were similar to those of the accident investigation study. Eight tests were run with the GM/TNO 6-month dummy and two were run with the CRABI 6-month dummy. The average values and ranges for the dummy responses in the tests are given in Table 2. Also shown are typical average values and ranges from three tests of the CRABI 6-Month dummy in rear-facing infant seats with the FMVSS 213 test procedure (SAE 1992) in which there is no instrument panel to contact. The only parameters that are significantly affected by contact with the instrument panel are the head accelerations and resulting HIC values, as shown by the two test conditions with the CRABI 6-Month dummy. Because of potential differences between the head impact response of the modified GM/TNO dummy and that of the CRABI 6-Month dummy, only the tests with the CRABI dummy will be used for further analysis and comparison. The measurements in these tests are representa- tive of impact responses in the 6-month old dummy under impact loading that have not been found to produce significant injuries in the field. Since they are dummy generated numbers for the size and type of dummy of interest in this report they can be used directly without scaling or other adjustments. All of the other information given in this section needs to be scaled for size and age or otherwise adjusted to be of use in meeting our goal of developing injury assess- ment reference values for use with the 6-month infant dummy BIOMECHANICAL STUDIES OF CHILDREN - A limited, but unique, study by Duncan (1874) reports on the tensile strength of the neck of the fresh full-term fetus. The purpose of the study was to give guidance to obstetricians on the appropriate level of force to apply in aiding the birth process in a breech (feet first) delivery. Although the study was performed over 100 years ago and involves only static loading, it represents a valuable source of information for estimating tensile neck load limits for infants. The test protocol involved taking stillborn infants (or in one case an infant that had died two weeks after birth) and supporting them vertically by the head through a simulated pelvis made of wood. A slowly increasing number of weights were suspended at the ankle until cervical spine failure occurred. The results of the five experiments were reported as shown in Table 3. The average of the five failure loads is 507 N, while the average of the four stillborn infants is 471 N. The one example of an infant that survived for 2 weeks has a significantly higher failure load than the others, even though the weight was within the range of the others. It is tempting to speculate that the higher load is due to rapid development after birth, but with only one example it is not possible to determine such an increase in a statistical sense. These data represent an extreme upper bound for injury of the cervical spine in newborn infants. It Is possible that stretching of the spinal cord due to associated stretching of the flexible ligaments of the spine, prior to the failures of the ligaments reported in this study, could have produced functional injury of the cord at much lower load levels in living infants (Fielding 1983). Conversely, active muscle tension in the living infant could slightly raise the load threshold for spinal injury, as could dynamic loading. Because current infant dummies do not exhibit realistic biomechanical neck response, it may 1556</page><page sequence="5">TABLE 3. STATIC FAILURE LOADS OF FETAL NECKS IN TENSION.

The greater stiffnesses of dummy necks tend to produce exaggerated forces under many kinematic conditions in crash tests. Only if the neck load is a direct reflection of an applied force, due to an external loading mechanism, might the dummy neck load reflect a realistic neck load on an infant. Another study of particular significance for interpret- ing the neck loading data of Duncan is reported by Yamada (1970). This voluminous compendium of the static mechanical properties of human tissues includes data on fetal calcaneal tendon properties in tension. Assuming that the relative development of this collagenous tissue is similar to that of the development of ligamentous tissue, these data can be used to estimate the increase in failure strength of the ligamen- tous tissue of the cervical spine. This information, combined with size information, allows estimation of the increase in total failure load due to development of the neck ligamentous structure. The data from Yamada is summarized in Table 4 both as absolute values and as a ratio of the adult value. The absolute values for strength and elongation are also shown in Figurei. The failure stress in tension at birth (ninth month) is 0.63 of the adult value and reaches 0.95 of the adult value before the ninth year. McPherson and Kriewall (1980) reported a study of the mechanical properties of fetal cranial bone. The focus of the study was to understand the Influence of these properties on molding of the head during birth. The study included tensile tests and bending tests on samples of skull bone from fetuses of different gesta- tional ages up to term and skull bone from one six- year-old child. The techniques used in the study allowed comparison of the average elastic modulus determined from bending for adult skull bone with that of the six-year-old child and the average of the term fetuses. The results of this study are of particular interest for this report because the skull bending stiffness data can be used as part the information needed to scale biomechanical data for bony structures from one size and age to another. In particular, the relative ratios of the bending moduli are of interest. McPherson reports these, in terms of ratios with respect to the adult value, as 0.243 for the term fetus and 0.667 for the six-year- old. These are much lower fractions of the adult values than for the more rapidly developing tendinous tissue reported by Yamada. SCALING OF BIOMECHANICAL DATA Scaling techniques have two important applications in biomechanical impact response analysis. One is the normalization of test data to a standard subject size. The other is the extension of information from a data base on one sized subject to describe the response of another significantly larger or smaller sized subject. In many experimental biomechanical impact studies an attempt is made to select only test subjects that represent the average or mid-size (50th percentile) male to avoid dealing with questions of scaling. However, most studies, particularly those using cadavers, end up with some variations in subject weight, height and/or shape. Such variations, if relatively minor, can be accounted for by a number of either empirical or theoretical scaling methods for normalizing the data. If, on the other hand, the test subjects have widely varying physical dimensions, or the data is to be transformed to estimate the response of a greatly different subject size, the procedures used to achieve the transformation must be consistent with basic principles of dimensional analysis. Impact biomechanics is concerned with the interaction of a striking structure with the human body. Quite often, in laboratory experiments designed to obtain impact response of the human body, the striking structure is a rigid body. The stresses at any point in the human body depend on the mass and velocity of the striking body, and the characteristic length, modulus of elasticity, Poisson's ratio, mass density, and damping of the body region being struck. Dimen- sional analysis methods (Langhaar, 1951; Taylor, 1974) indicate that, for mechanical systems in which heat and electrical effects are absent, the pertinent physical quantities of the system can be scaled geometrically by three independent scale factors relating mass, length, and time. For structural analysis, the three useful quantities are length, mass density, and modulus of elasticity (stiffness). If three dimensionless ratios are formed from these quantities as: LENGTH: ^-L = *-m I Lp MASS DENSITY: ^•p ~ Pm / Pp MODULUS OF ELASTICITY: *€ = Em 1 Ep where, m, refers to the model or subject to be scaled to, and, p, refers to the prototype or standard to be scaled from, then all other scaling factors for the physical quantities associated with the description of the impact response 1558</page><page sequence="7">Figure 1 .

When scaling data between adult subjects It is reasonable to assume that the moduli of elasticity and the mass densities of the model and prototype are the same and the scale factors for these quantities are equal to one. The effect of this assumption is that all the physical factors can be scaled as functions of the basic length scale factor, X|_, assuming geometric similitude. However, for the case of scaling from adults to children or scaling between different sizes and ages of children, it is not appropriate to assume the moduli of elasticity of the model and prototype are the same because of the developing mechanical properties of the body tissues in children. Thus, the following scale fac- tors can be formed forscaling of child biomechanical data: LENGTH: X'_ = Lm / Lp, basic definition MASS: Xp = (X|_)3, equal densities MODULUS OF ELASTICITY: XE = Em / Ep, basic definition TIME: Xy = X|_ / (XE)^2 VELOCITY: XV = (XE)1/2 ACCELERATION: Хд = Xe / X|_ FORCE: ^F = (^L)2 xE HIC: ^hic = (*A)2'5 ^T = (Хе)2/(Х|_)1-5 To scale the biomechanical parameters used as injury assessment reference values from the various sources discussed in the previous sections to the six- month-old infant, then, it is necessary to specify not only the relative lengths of the body regions of interest but the relative modulus ratios as well. The anthropometry of the six-month-old is well-docu- mented as part of the CRABI 6-Month dummy specification package (SAE 1991) and appropriate quantities of interest to this report are shown in Table 5 along with comparable values for the adult mid-size male, the six year-old child, the three year-old child and a newly born child. Also shown in Table 5, are the resulting length scale factors for the body regions and sizes. We need to use the skull bone modulus of elasticity data from McPherson and Kriewall (1980) to determine the necessary modulus of elasticity ratio for the skull and chest of the six-month-old infant and the calcaneal tendon strength data from Yamada (1970) to determine the scaling of the neck tensile strength of the six-month-old infant. Figure 2 presents the data as the infant-to-adult properties ratios as functions of age. Notice that, at birth, the skull stiffness is rela- tively low compared to the adult value while the tendon strength is over 60 per cent of the adult value. Once born, the rates of development of the various proper- ties are similar, leading to the tendon developing near- adult values much earlier than the skull bone. We are primarily interested in interpolating between the zero- year and six-year range where, fortunately, the various property development curves can be approximated by a linear fit of development with age. ESTABLISHING ESTIMATES OF INJURY ASSESS- MENT REFERENCE VALUES FOR THE CRABI 6- MONTH-OLD INFANT DUMMY INJURY ASSESSMENT REFERENCE VALUES BASED ON SCALING FROM LARGER DUMMIES - The injury assessment reference values developed for the adult mid-size male (Mertz, 1993), six year old, and 3 year old dummies must be scaled to estimate the corresponding values for the 6 month infant dummy using the procedures discussed in the preceding section. The scaling factors used for this, in combination with the corresponding geometric scale factors listed in Table 5 and the relationships in the previous section, are listed in Table 6. The resulting scaled injury assessment reference values from each sized dummy are given below: SCALING FROM ADULT MID-SIZE MALE DUMMY lARVs (INITIAL VALUES IN PARENTHESES) HIC (1000) = 121 HIC TIME LIMIT (15 msec) = 22 msec 1560</page><page sequence="9">TABLE 5 CHARACTERISTIC DIMENSIONS AND LENGTH SCALE FACTORS.

The average static tensile load of 507 N at failure of the cervical spine can be scaled to the 6 month age by use of the calcaneal tendon strength ratio - age curve from Figure 1 . The resulting load value is 81 1 N and would be interpreted as a high probability of fatal neck injury due to direct applied load to the head. A comparable value from the Mertz and Weber study of 3 year old air bag dummy neck tension is 1350 N, which would scale to a 6 month old value of 962 N. As noted before, these values, and their inference of a high probability of injury, may not be directly applicable to dummy neck load measurements because of the lack of biomechanical realism of dummy necks at this time. COMPARISON OF SCALED IARVS WITH CRABI 6-MONTH DUMMY GENERATED VALUES - The scaled injury assessment reference values for the 6 month infant can be compared with the results of sled tests with the CRABI 6-month dummy to allow some perspective to be established between the two methods of IARV estimation. This is shown for peak head acceleration, HIC, neck load, and chest accelera- tion, respectively, in Figures 3-6 for each of the scaling methods and the two dummy test conditions (with and without instrument panel contact) in rear-facing sled tests. The peak resultant head accelerations shown in Figure 3 are relatively consistent, with the exception of the value scaled from the midsize male. The very different nature of the infant skull in comparison to the adult skull makes this Figure 3. Comparison of Peak Resultant Head Acceleration IARV Estimation Methods. particular scaling somewhat tenuous due to a lack of geometric similitude. The values scaled from the 3 and 6 year old dummy are closer together and are brack- eted by the sled test values. The average of these four values is 54 G. Figure 4 shows the corresponding HIC value estimations for the five cases. The scaled 6 year old dummy and the scaled mid-size male dummy values are considerably different than the other three values whose average is 353. 1562</page><page sequence="11">Figure 4. Comparison of HIC lARV Estima- tion Methods The estimated neck tension lARVs shown in Figure 5 are accompanied by scaled values from the Duncan fetal neck strength study and from the high probability of injury value of the Mertz and Weber study of the 3 year old air bag dummy. The value scaled from the mid-size male is close to those two values. The structural differences between the adult and the child cervical spine make scaling of adult neck lARVs questionable due to a lack of geometric similitude. The remaining four estimates of a neck tension IARV for the CRABI 6-Month-old dummy have an average value of 491 N. The estimated peak chest acceleration lARVs shown in Figure 6 are scattered around an average Figure 5.

The structure of the infant chest is similar to that of the adult, only the material properties differ. Scaling from the adult to the infant is accordingly more reasonable than for the neck and head. Figure 6. Comparison of Peak Resultant Chest Acceleration IARV Estimation Methods. ESTIMATING CRABI 6-MONTH DUMMY IARVS FOR REAR-FACING RESTRAINT INTERACTION WITH A DEPLOYING AIRBAG - Based on the cluster- ing of the various values for each parameter around the average values given in Figures 3-6 and rounding up or down to the nearest significant number, the estimates of the injury assessment reference values for application with the CRABI 6-month dummy in tests with a deploying passenger airbag are as follows: PEAK RESULTANT HEAD ACCELERATION = 50 G associated with a HIC (22 msec time limit) = 390 PEAK UPPER NECK TENSILE FORCE = 500 N PEAK RESULTANT CHEST ACCELERATION = 50 G The HIC value of 390 was obtained by taking the 50 G limit as a constant acceleration value for 22 msec. The 390 value for HIC should not be used as an allowable value for shorter time duration head resultant accelerations with values above 50 G. An associated concern exists for the possibility of neck compression during testing of infant restraint interaction with an airbag. This can occur when the infant restraint is pushed rearward in the car by the air- bag and the dummy head contacts the back rest of the vehicle front seat or by direct contact of the inflating airbag on the top of the dummy head. Because of the complexities of cervical spine failure mechanics, there are no conditions that have been identified that would allow the techniques used to estimate the above lARVs to be applied to this parameter. As an alternative, the infant neck tension limit of 500 N can be proportioned by the ratio of the neck peak compression limit to the neck peak tension limit for the mid-size male to obtain an equivalent value for infant neck compression. This ratio (4000 N/3300N) yields the following neck com- pression IARV for the 6 month-old infant dummy: 1563</page><page sequence="12">PEAK UPPER NECK COMPRESSIVE FORCE = 606 N By a similar argument the other upper neck lARVs can be estimated from the mid-size male values for shear force and bending moment as follows: PEAK UPPER NECK SHEAR FORCE = 470 N PEAK UPPER NECK FLEXION MOMENT = 16.4 Nm PEAK UPPER NECK EXTENSION MOMENT = 5 Nm DISCUSSION The purpose of this analysis is to establish injury assessment reference values specific to the CRABI 6- Month dummy for use in evaluating the interaction of rear-facing infant restraints with a deploying passenger airbag. The crash conditions under which this interaction can be expected to occur are fairly predict- able and the primary determinants of the severity of the interaction are the deployment characteristics of the airbag system. The kinematics of the infant restraint system are similarly well-defined. Because of these factors and the small size of the occupant we are trying to protect, it is reasonable to be conservative in specifying the injury assessment reference values to be used in evaluating design countermeasures to minimize inflation-induced-injury potential. It should be noted that, in the case of head injury assessment, the peak acceleration IARV of 50 G is primary and still pertains for the HIC IARV of 390 (that is, a short duration value of HIC less than 390 must still not have its peak acceleration greater than 50 G). The lARVs estimated in the above analysis represent values that are only slightly greater, if at all, than those seen in infant restraint tests for FMVSS 213. The FMVSS 213 test condition is a 30 mph velocity change crash simulation and has produced infant restraint systems that perform well in the field. Keeping the dummy responses in an airbag interaction test, which is run at a nominal threshold deployment condition 16 mph velocity change, to below the estimated lARVs should provide a conservative, but realistic, level of protection.
