<plain_text><page sequence="1">III.-ON THINKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE By F. J. 0. CODDINGTON. THIS paper was originally written for a small group of personal friends. Hence it is in the form of an autobio- graphical confession of faith, or lack of it; a presentation of part of the tiny precipitate of some forty years of spasmodic contemplation. Thus, while I attempt to give grounds for my conclusions, I do not present any elaborate closely-knit argument on any one point. I preach to the nearly converted, not science so much as nescience... IN the long, slow episodic unrolling of my life, and of learning from books and people and meditation, I have (like all of us) from time to time encountered certain ideas, principles or methods of thought or of attack which seem to me master keys-keys not indeed to unlock the ultimate hidden mysteries, but at any rate good enough to open many doors-if only to show how empty are the boasted treasure stores some of them guard from the public eye. One characteristic common to these master ideas is that they convince me at once, that is to say, once I have heard them set out clearly and in detail, with some practical applications to their subject matter-when this has been done effectively, they seem to illuminate, like a sudden torch, and I become almost impatient of the slow, laborious, scientific proof which others quite rightly demand. It is the application of some of these methods of enquiry to problems concerned with the interpretation of the universe that I wish to discuss today. Perhaps the most obvious example is that key, or rather bunch of keys, labelled " Evolution." I do not mean F</page><page sequence="2">48 F. J. 0. CODDINGTON. Darwinism, or any other precise and detailed. theory of biological development, but the broad conviction that most matters can be better appreciated when one has contem- plated their history and development in the belief that these are likely to have proceeded by a system of growth con- ditioned by heredity and reaction to environment. As a smaller example, indeed a child, of Evolution consider the difficulties of language. The words, grammar, phraseology of any language, of English in particular, have been built up by many men singly and in co-operation over many years. The grammar and phraseology both fit and tend to produce the attitude to the world peculiar to the nation-so that they indicate the national characteristics of the individual. The words have been elaborated out of simple root sounds, whose sound and meaning derive from the most primitive antiquity, and these elaborations have been so multifarious and complex that the original root meanings of the elements of a word are often forgotten-indeed only scholars know them, and they can seldom make much use of their knowledge. What scholars do know is that nearly all words are frozen metaphors, metaphors whose origin and meaning are forgotten or unknown by those who use the words. Such a word has a new, less coloured, more abstract meaning of its own, one to be discovered mainly by reference to its context. It is in this way that babies, children, and indeed adults, learn the meaning of most words, namely by reference to the contexts in which they meet them. Two very important conclusions emerge from these considerations. First, as every man meets any word in a whole series of contexts peculiar to himself and different as a collection from those of anyone else, very many words bear slightly different meanings to different people-so that it is impossible to be sure that one conveys any intended meaning precisely and undistorted to any listener. Secondly, as all root words point to concrete, obvious, primitive entities such as rain, stone, danger, and so on, and as other words have been built</page><page sequence="3">ON THINKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE. 49 up of these elements and built up to meet everyday needs of barbarian and later of civilised inter-communication between average human beings, all words retain something of their earthy origin, they are essentially practical, concerned with daily life, concrete, limited, partial. With this origin and connotation they cannot easily stand for or transmit abstract ideas. Moreover, as they all derive from the limited and the concrete, it is still more difficult to use them effectively when discussing the universal or the universe as a whole, or any abstract aspect of it. Against the imperfections of their medium, philosophers have long struggled, in particular in two directions, both of which, it seems to me, lead to error. The first is in the effort to define words, particularly ultimate words such as beauty, substance, mind, and so on. To the unsophisticated, definition implies description, or meaning-but this is not alone what the philosopher demands. To define derives from the picture of putting a line or boundary round, like the circle in pictorial logic-and he desires a clear statement showing the exact limits, as well as the general meaning, of the word, and is satisfied with nothing less. Moreover, the literary tradition requires the definition to be as short and neat as possible. The results of these demands, the attempts to meet them, minute and detailed refutations of these attempts, and consequent argumentations, have filled volumes of wearisome disputation-both before and after Socrates-with inadequate practical result. The lawyer does better than that. All his language is concerned with finite, indeed small, everyday subject matter, where language is at home-yet it is very seldom that he attempts to define, in the sense I have mentioned above, and still less frequently does he try to do so in some short epigrammatic phrase. Under " definition section " in a Statute one comes upon such phrases as " Horse includes mule": " Driver includes steersman "-these merely make certain that specified border line cases are to be inside the boundary-the boundary line as a whole is hardly ever drawn. When, as often, the Judges are deciding a dispute which turns on the meaning of a F 2</page><page sequence="4">50 F. J. o. CODDINGTON. word, they seldom purport to do more than to explain how it applies to a given set of facts, and they often take pages to do this. The best example of the point I am labouring is perhaps a cloud sailing alone in a blue sky. Even a child can recognise a cloud, and knows what the word refers to. Yet the more closely a cloud is examined, the more impossible does it appear to be to point out exactly where the boundary of the cloud is. Here, in its middle, it is undoubtedly cloud, there, far away, certainly is none, but there is a considerable borderland where the cloud becomes thinner and thinner, and one cannot say where it ends. Moreover the same cloud looks different to different observers, just as the rainbow does. Of course, I do not suggest that there are no words which cannot be precisely defined. There are many which can, especially words dealing with small, everyday matters, such as egg, or three, or next. But there are many, and these the most important to the philosopher, which cannot- nevertheless we can mentally grasp them to some extent in much the same way as we can a cloud-and if we only remember the limitations of our power, we can use them effectively within those limitations. The second error commonly made by philosophers is to attempt to use language as if it were algebra. An algebraic symbol is a sign (usually a letter of the alphabet) which stands for and replaces something else, whereas a word is a signpost which directs the mind away from itself to some- thing else. When we use an algebraic symbol, in algebraic manipulation, we use it in order to forget what it stands for while manipulating it; when we use a word we use it to remind us of what it stands for. We use language in order to think about a topic, we use algebra in order to avoid thinking about it. Algebra is a thinking machine, language is crystallised thought. I agree that the distinction I have just made between algebra and language is exaggerated for the sake of emphasis, and is not quite accurate-algebra is used some-</page><page sequence="5">ON THINKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE. 51 times almost as language and vice versa. But broadly, the distinction exists, and is important. Now, algebraic symbols are manipulated according to certain rules which are imposed on them by the nature of the subject matter which they replace. Thus if x stands for a number, x + x 2x, while if x stands for a statement * + x = x, because x + x merely means that the statement is repeated, not altered. Words, on the other hand, are manipulated according to the rules of grammar and of logic. Grammar depends on the language used; it is based on the methods of thought of the genius of the particular speech-group-let us say (loosely) of the nation -and while it must be obeyed, it only tends to truth in the sense that an ungrammatical sentence strictly speaking has no meaning, and cannot be true or untrue. As to logic, there are three varieties, which shade into each other. There is the " schools " logic-the syllogism. This logic is based on the examination of small concrete statements, about small concrete easily-understood matters, and it teaches us how to extract a statement derived from two others-the first two are assumed to be true, and it then follows that the extraction is also true. This is a simple and interesting exercise, where, firstly, we know precisely the exact meaning and sharp definition of all the words employed, a condition not applicable to cloud words, and secondly, where we can make sure that they are all employed throughout in unaltered sense. " To weigh yourself well is to know yourself well; to know yourself well is to be well, etc." is a common example of an absurdly inaccurate argument, based mainly on obvious changes of meaning of the word " well,"-but there are many bad but subtle fallacies which turn on more hidden shifts of meaning. Then there is symbolic logic. Many mathematical minds, hypnotised by the fascination, facility and success of the manipulation of symbols of quantity, etc., called algebra, have dreamed of solving all the riddles of the universe by a similar manipulation of symbols standing for concepts or</page><page sequence="6">52 r. J. o. CODDINGTON. propositions. There is much charm in this hope. But it depends on the concepts or propositions being all precise, un'alterable and completely definite-and these conditions exist only when dealing with concrete, finite, simple topics; they do not exist for the topics of philosophy. When " schools' " logical arguments, or symbolic logic demonstra- tions, elicit a surprising result which revolts common sense, this usually means that we have not understood the elements we started with, that we have postulated as true some state- ment that contains some unnoticed falsehood, or have accepted some concept which contains some unnoticed vagueness or self-contradiction. The third variety of logic I can only describe vaguely, I mean any argument which cannot easily be grouped under one or both of the other two heads, yet which appears formal and to lead to a necessary result-such arguments as one may meet in a political election speech. The many varieties of error that may be concealed in this are well known, they range from taking for granted something that a focussed attention would reject, to shifting the meanings of words during the course of the demonstration. Now, when I say that some philosophers use language as if it were algebra, I mean that they use words highly abstract or otherwise difficult to grasp with absolute certainty that one has their precise, complete and unalterable denotation, and they use those words in lengthy arguments which appear to obey the laws of grammar and of logic so as to reach unexpected results-results from which the very mind which willingly conceded the premises would be the first to revolt. " If that's what I meant when I said I agreed with you just now, then all I can reply is that after all I do not agree with what you started with " is the natural retort of the plain man-and I think he is wise. He distrusts, and wisely distrusts, the use of language as if it were algebra wherever the " answer to the sum " looks wrong to him. It is not difficult to give examples of this kind of thing. The metaphysical books are, in my opinion, full of it.</page><page sequence="7">ON THINCING AIBOUT T1HE UNIVERSE. 53 Here is one: Collingwood in effect says: Metaphysics is the science of that universal which is pre-supposed by other universals, in their hierarchy. The ultimate universal is being. Therefore Metaphysics is the Science of being. But science means systematic orderly thinking about anything. But you cannot think systematically about being because it is one, indivisible, without qualities. Therefore there cannot be a science of being, and also being is nothing, the same as not being. Ontology is non- existent. This is very impressive, but surely it is nonsense Perhaps I should explain that his example of a hierarchy of universals is odd numbers, even numbers, all numbers. He speaks of a science of odd numbers, a science of even numbers, and arithmetic. But arithmetic includes all there is known about odd and about even numbers, it does not consist merely of what else is known about numbers, after knowledge about odd and even numbers has been abstracted. Similarly, his science of being should not be a science of what is left after everything else has been taken away, but a science of all that is contained in the lesser universals that comprise the pyramid whose top is being, that is to say, all science. You cannot have the pinnacle of a pyramid without the pyramid itself. Secondly, to say that being is the same as not being simply refers to difficulties of thought and of language, not to actual fact. One might as well say that to be alive is the same as to be dead, and not even a Christian Scientist goes as far as that. A common variety of the fallacious use of words is what is called the a priori argument. This consists of starting with stated postulates, which are supposed to be obvious and to be based on the unquestionable verities of nature, and arguing in an apparently formal and unanswerable way to reach a new conclusion. The history of medicine is full of such arguments, which resulted in conclusions which have subsequently been utterly overthrown by experiment. The great alterations in curative dietary, based on the</page><page sequence="8">54 F. J. 0. CODDINGTON. experimental discoveries of vitamins, afford examples. An old doctor once said to me " You cannot separate a disease from its symptoms. Cure the symptoms and you cure the disease "-an argument nowadays only accepted by the vendors of headache powders. Again, the ancient astronomers argued that the circle was the perfect curve, and therefore God made the planets revolve in circles- calculation based on observation of " irreducible and stubborn facts " has disproved this. Considerations such as these lead one to distrust any metaphysical argument employing words and phrases unless it is possible throughout the argument to attach ponderable meaning to those words and phrases and also possible to use alternative words and phrases to set out the argument, so that one can follow the argument by appreciating the interplay of the ideas rather than the pattern of the words. Further, words point to ideas. And fresh difficulties arise when we consider ideas, particularly ideas used to appraise the universe. Historically, the mind is a practical instru- ment used to preserve the life of the individual and the group, and early ideas are essentially practical, concrete and limited. As man has developed from barbarian to civilian and towards philosophy his ideas have no doubt developed, become more subtle, more abstract, wider, but even so they are in general concerned with daily life, and, however wide, are referred to limited portions of the whole, to parts of the universe existing in measurable time. Hence, when we try to contemplate the universe we have to be continually on our guard against employing ideas too small for so great a topic. A child, whose greatest joy was to eat plum pudding, said "Does God eat plum pudding every day?" My own father once said to me, " You must say your prayers. If you forget God, God will forget you." No argument is necessary to prove to us that the ideas used in these remarks are far too small-too anthropomorphic, if you like the word- to fit the God of any educated man with an adult mind. The people who used them would probably be</page><page sequence="9">ON THINKING ABOUt THE UNIVERSE. 55 unable to grasp the fact that their ideas of God could not be correct, because too small-they certainly would be incapable of finding this out for themselves. Here, at any rate, we have the advantage. We have the power to test our ideas and to measure their inadequacy, to some extent at any rate, so that we may know where we must fail, quite apart from the question as to whether we can ever succeed. Take, for example, the idea of fatigue. Whenever we exercise will, we make muscular movements. Thinking itself, and also movement, both tend to make one tired. Sooner or later we all get tired, we all sleep. We wake fresh, we exert energy, we tire, we sleep. We are born, grow up, grow old, grow tired, we die. The idea of fatigue is deeply rooted in us. We find analogous examples in nature. The flower fades. Metal frequently bent breaks, we say it gets tired. Nations vanish from the earth. They say suns cool and end as globes of ice. And so, everywhere, in varied fragments of the physical universe we see the appearance of fatigue-which we relate to the fatigue we personally experience. And fatigue, in ourselves, is contrasted with freshness, which precedes it, and with sleep, in which it ends. Thus fatigue is associated with a process having a beginning and an end. And so are many other ideas, cause and effect for example. Cause and effect are two termini of a process in time. And every cause is the effect of preceding causes, every effect is a part of the cause of subsequent effects. When I was a young man one eminent scientist (using the idea of fatigue) announced that the physical universe was like a clock that had been wound up and would eventually run down and come to a standstill, dead, still and cold; another said the atom (then conceived as a small solid billiard ball) bore the stamp of a manu- factured article) never realising that the manufacturer was, not the Deity, but the Scientist). All such ideas combine to describe the universe as some- thing manufactured, started going and steadily running down to an end. It was caused, it began, it became tired, it will stop. If so, what caused it? What started it?</page><page sequence="10">56 IF. J. o. CObIANGTON. God the great First Cause, replied the early seekers. But God is a part of the universe, or some may say is the universe. Then who caused God ? Whence did he get the energy he passed on to the Universe when he wound it up ? The only possible answer is a yet greater God. But who caused Him ? And so we come to the indefinite regress, the conclusive test (to all but Mr. Dunne) of the inadequacy of an idea to the task of comprehending the Universe. It follows that the Universe cannot have begun, cannot grow tired, cannot end-follows not as an experimental fact, but because the ideas of beginning and ending, freshness and fatigue, cause and effect cannot be appropriate to the Universe, any more than the idea of eating plum pudding can be appropriate to God. Consideration of ideas, and their inadequacy, leads to consideration of the mind thinking them, and of its incom- pleteness. For the greater part of my working life my mind keeps up a perpetual monologue. When I am not speaking, I seem to hear a small voice pouring out an endless com- mentary on the topic engaging my attention, and this commentary usually expresses itself in grammatically correct English which appears, to me at any rate, to be logically accurate! When I speak aloud I am usually merely vocalising the interior voice. I begin a sentence without having previously voiced the end of it to myself, with the justified confidence that I shall complete it correctly; and I nmake my speech appropriate to my audience (or flatter myself I do so) not by consciously choosing my words but by adopting the appropriate mental attitude. Of course one does much thinking which does not come within this description, and which is not verbal at all, e.g. when boxing, but taking it by and large, my thoughts are born fully dressed, complete-they, certainly, bear the stamp of the manufactured article. I am like Charles Lamb's loathed Scotchman. Lamb himself claimed to be able to catch his thoughts in process of crystallisation, and it may be that some gifted people with exceptionally high levels of consciousness can do so. But, anyhow, where do one's</page><page sequence="11">ON THINKING ABOUT THE UVNIVERSE. 57 thoughts come from ? In what darkness are they manu- factured ? I can well understand how Socrates heard the voice of his Guardian, how religious leaders have claimed to receive inspiration from the voice of their God. For thoughts do seem either to come, or to be thrust, into consciousness from elsewhere. The simile of the fountain, attracts me as the picture nearest to the facts. The jet invades the sunlight, clear-cut, dancing-but from whence comes it ? The answer given by the modern psychologist is a further elaboration of what one can find and verify by introspective memory. The thought monologue is made in the psychic depths of one's being, it is the work of the subconscious. By a process-of great importance, but I do not stop to examine it now-one focusses the burning light of attention on a topic. Straightway the subconscious reacts to it. Inherited instincts contribute to that reaction, so do the experiences of childhood; later experiences also affect the attitude, memories and vestiges of memories crowd to help, one's natural method of attack tends to become active, and atop of all, whenever the problem is a professional one, the training one has had, in learning to imitate the methods of grappling common to predecessors in the profession, is employed-and all these different, and often conflicting, elements in the subconscious combine to produce the integrated result of the conscious monologue. Once a statement has been made or written it can be tested, one may say mechanically, for faults of grammar or of logic, or for historical or scientific accuracy, etc.-but beyond this the critic, in turn, has to rely on his subsconscious to spout up thoughts of agreement, variation or contradiction. And all our thoughts, whether we read or criticise, are coloured and conditioned by the state of our subconscious- that is, by our heredity and history. Our thinking is actually done by our subconscious and is to that extent beyond our control, and is conditioned by our heredity, history and memory. We are, all of us, very conscious of each other's deficiencies, still more sure</page><page sequence="12">58 t. J. 0. CODIDNGTON. of the mental feebleness grading down to imbecility of the majority of human beings; and we realise moreover that we also-even we- are merely links in the long chain of human evolution, imperfect and uncompleted physically and mentally. How can we hope with such inchoate minds, working so subterraneously, so ephemerally, so partially, to trust ourselves or others to reach more than vague and provisional parables of the Universe ? Given such minds, such ideas, such words wherewith to rationalise the Universe, how do we get in touch with it ? A necessary preliminary enquiry is whether there are any such entities as the Universe and myself. That some- thing which may be called a Universe including myself exists is absolutely certain, whether there be one such unit or many. There must be at least one, for my consciousness is certain and therefore there is a Universe which must be at least that. And that I exist is equally certain, for consciousness involves at least one unity, and that unity may be called I. The question which does arise is, can I be separated from the rest of the universe, or am I the Universe? When I dream, I see other people, external things. When I wake, I know these were figments of my dream, they existed only in my imagination. How do I know that my whole waking life is not one long dream, wherein all others are but appearances with no internal life of their own-and that when I wake from life, they will not disappear? How do I know that I am not God? It has been said that the theory of Solipsism is one which none can disprove and none but a madman believes. I will only say that if I were God I would not cast myself for the humble and frequently thwarted role I have played through- out my life. And I may remind you that the theory has been neatly satirised by Lewis Carroll, where Alice is told she is part of the dream of the Red Queen. I start then from the position that while I am in and a part of the Universe, I am sufficiently separate from the rest of the Universe to be able to regard it as other, as object -though the degree of that separation is question for enquiry.</page><page sequence="13">ON THINKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE. 59 How do I get in touch with the rest of the Universe ? The common answer is " Through the five senses. Through sight, hearing, touch, smell and taste." Physiology demon- strates that each of these senses works through nerves, which like telegraph wires convey electro-chemical impulses to that complex electrical organism the brain. Electrical excitation of the brain directly causes, or is, or has a one-to- one correspondence with, appropriate sensations, and thus we learn about the outer world. This explanation, which is accepted in daily life by almost everybody, from the savage or the labourer to the scientist, carries its own paradox-I had almost said, its own refutation-within it. It means that our knowledge of the outer world is based on our interpretation of electric messages received inside the head. But no living brain has ever been outside the head. A man is like a telephone operator seated in a telephone exchange who has never been outside that exchange and who can never get out and therefore can never verify his interpretation of any of the messages he has received. No man gets outside his eye, his ear, his skin. He sees, hears, feels with his brain, and what the thing he thinks he sees, hears, feels, really is, he cannot be sure. Worse than that, eye, ear, nerve, skull, brain, these are all known to him as exteriors, as in the same world as the drum (say) he supposes he sees, hears, touches. What they really are, equally he cannot be sure. Whether he really does receive messages at all, he cannot be sure. He is the telephone operator imprisoned for ever in the exchange, who does not even know for certain when his instruments tinkle and messages arrive, whether these are genuine messages or, if they are, from what other intelligences or starting points they come. This fundamental, startling paradox is commonplace ABC to philosophers, and incredible nonsense to everybody else. Why this should be, I have never been able to under- stand, as I worked it out for myself when a boy, though I</page><page sequence="14">60 F. J. 0. CODDINGTON. failed to get further than to be rather frightened by the thought. However this may be, it seems to me to divide thinkers into two parties-those who are overwhelmed by the discovery and make too much of it; these call them- selves idealists: and those who ignore it and call themselves realists, or by other names. For myself, I go the first part of the way with the idealists. I agree with them, that to appraise our apparent knowledge of otherness we must attack from within out- wards. We must begin with the only thing we have direct acquaintance with-with what philosophers call experience, which tends to be nearly identified with consciousness. A first glance at consciousness shows us a world of separated and known things and people, acting and reacting, in space, altering and moving through time, and thought about by myself. But only slight analysis is required to satisfy me that my own thought has done more and is more mixed up with my world than I at first realised. In the night I see something vague, and wonder whether it is a bush or a bear; I hear a noise and wonder whether it is a lorry or a plane; I touch something wet and wonder whether it is water or blood. Thus I learn that but for the mind's interpretation, things seen, heard, felt, would be mere portions of the total seen, heard, felt; and indeed that the separation of these portions from the total is itself the work of the mind. Without the separating, interpreting work of the mind, to give multi- plicity and meaning to the continuum of experience, my world would be but a booming, buzzing, coloured confusion without either true multiplicity or true unity. The mind gives sight to the eye. It may be noted that experience must be a continuum because it is one experience, my experience, but its unity is forced on it by that fact alone, in the first place, while its multiplicity is fundamental insofar as consciousness is necessarily varied, but the separation of portions of it is made by the mind, to start with. There is no vacuum in experience, and each variety ties on to the next without interval, like the colours in a rainbow.</page><page sequence="15">ON THINKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE. 61 Why then does the mind interpret experience as it does ? And why do we all interpret it alike, if we do ? Firstly, no doubt, because we all inherit a tendency amounting practically to compulsion so to interpret. This one can infer from the behaviour of the young of animals. Though many have guessed, no one knows what is the conscious life of a newly born baby. The child cries for the moon, and is certainly no judge of distance or other details, and squints too much to see solid contours. But he begins by relying on touch, the historically fundamental sense, from which the other senses appear to have exfoliated, so he probably uses the category of space. Thence, it has been suggested, he proceeds to realise otherness by the perpetual thwarting of his will, and so on to realising other people, and thence to separating other things from other minds. May I remind you of the lines in Tennyson's "In Memoriam" beginning " The infant, new to earth and sky." Thus we start, analytically if not historically, with a continuum of experience which may be catalogued as sensations, emotions, conations, memories, thoughts, etc., at first without separation or meaning, and we go on to interpretation which divides experience into two main groups, private or interior thought, and public or external objects, and their states. The main characteristics of public objects and their states are that they exist for other minds more or less as they do for us, and that their existence does not appear to depend on their being present to our minds or to those of anyone else-except possibly themselves, when they are alive. These characteristics we attribute to public objects and we interpret them under the categories of time and space. Time, but not space, is a category under which we organise our private experience, our varying thoughts. Space is of course an abstract category, not found in experience, it is our method of organising our interpretation of the multiplicity and togetherness of the public objects we separate yet apprehend simultaneously by the work of the</page><page sequence="16">62 F. J. 0. CODDINOTON. mind. One can vaguely half-imagine a mind organising multiplicity and togetherness under some different kind of space from ours. Time is equally an abstraction, it corres- ponds wlith all and every kind of movement, variation, change-for all these involve succession-and variation seems fundamental to consciousness, to experience, to life- thus Time, in its concrete form of succession, seems to me as real as experience itself, of the very stuff of the universe as known to us most intimately, and when analysed to the limit. As I have already said, among the public objects our interpretation of our psychic shadow-show places in the space-time-matter world are the machinery of sensation, eye, ear, skin, nerve, brain. The working of this machinery as explained by physiology, and science generally, suggests that the things we see, hear, feel, are, or at least may be, very different " in reality " from what they appear to be to us. The same possibility is of course obvious from the philosophical analysis of experience I have just outlined. Our interpretations of the separated details of experience, in particular of public objects, are therefore merely pro- visional working hypotheses, or symbols-what the public objects are in themselves or in reality is either unknowable, or a problem requiring difficult research. When I speak of what a public object " really " is, or is " in reality," I mean what it is in its own right, what it is apart from the fact that it is a distinguishable element in the consciousness of myself and other similar conscious units. A public object is a kind of algebraic symbol. One can manipulate it, but it still remains x. What does x stand for ? It is possible to assert that a public object is nothing in its own right, nothing apart from the fact that it is an element in consciousness, that x stands for x and for nothing beyond. But this is contrary to the whole practical interpretation and behaviour of mankind. No one who believed it would dare to put money in his purse, and his purse in his pocket, and then go shopping.</page><page sequence="17">ON THINKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE. 63 All material objects are either alive or not. We are sure that other humans, and other similar animals, have an interior psychic life similar to ours, and share with us the same public world-so that these objects have each a public external aspect and a private internal aspect-and we can extend this belief to all other living things and appreciate that their existence does not depend on their entrance into our personal experience. But with inorganic, so-called " dead" matter, the position is different. This also, we say, does not depend for its existence upon its entrance into any one personal experience, and yet we say it obviously has no private internal aspect of its own. Since the psychic is the only existence known to us immediately, how can this be ? The idealists find it necessary to postulate a universal mind, an absolute, or a God (like the Mana-Yood-Sushai of Dunsany's " Pegana ") in whose psychic experience exists all matter. This desperate solution does not attract me. It is a kind of extruded gigantesque Red-Queenish solipsism. I think it simpler to suppose that matter exists for itself, has an internal aspect of psychic nature-though such psychic internality is beyond any clear imaginative picturing. I will attack this problem again shortly, from another angle. I have pointed out that our interpretations of our multiplicities in terms of matter-time-space are merely provisional working hypotheses. Let us now remember that these hypotheses have been posited by minds whose ancestors for uncounted generations have been soaked in the environments which they had to interpret, or perish. Therefore I wish to emphasise, what so many philosophers seem to overlook, how magnificently our working hypotheses do work. They have enabled man to master the earth, to control his environment to an unexamplect degree, to co-operate with other minds, to widen his life far beyond that of any other animal, to look before and after, to question himself, his deity, his, universe. G</page><page sequence="18">64 F. J. 0. CODDINGTON. Not only has he built up his common-sense world by the use of his senses, he has made tools to extend those senses. The telescope and the microscope (of the old- fashioned type) are the first and obvious tools, and these alone have forced and enabled him to modify his original working hypotheses for others covering more facts in a wider world but still provisional and working only. So far as this, and except for a few boundary cases, there has been found a firm trustworthy one-to-one relationship between the thing in itself and the working hypothesis of the common man's mind-a chair may be all kinds of strange marvels to itself, or in reality, or to God; to me it is just a chair, and I sit on it with confidence. Of course the chair may let me down, and as a matter of fact various boundary cases do, and therefore in order to deal with these cases and to extend our control over nature, scientists- always broadly accepting and working within the normal matter-space-time interpretation-have developed other working hypotheses. They have also devised other exten- sions or apparent extensions, of our sensory organs-to enable us to see, or measure, various otherwise inappreciable things. This has gradually led (by a series of steps which, like those of one lost in a desert, vary more and more from common sense) to the vast body of organised science, with its novel alien working hypotheses of today. Especially does this apply to electricity, an entity practically unknown until recently. Among modern scientific hypo- theses are the conception of matter as progressively molecular, atomic, electronic, and of the electron (including proton, positron, neutron, et hoc genus omne-the billiard ball turned rocket) as alternatively wave or particle. May this wave-particle of electricity perhaps be as near as we can go to a provisional interpretation of the unit of life, and the psychic unit, of the Universe ? However this speculation may be, I would call your attention to this. We start with the continuum of experi- ence, unorganised unity. Thence we separate by analysis other from me, public from private, unities from each</page><page sequence="19">ON THINKING ABOUT THE UNIVERSE. 65 other, some as psychic individuals, some as formations of matter, thence scientifically to cells, to molecules and finally to electrons. Although we sometimes consider the interrelation or interdependence of groups, the typical work of the mind is to separate more and more into less and less, till finally we come psychically to the unit of ex- perience, physically to the particle of electricity-in either case to the monad, cut off, separated from the rest, unique, self-contained, related to but isolated from all the others. Yet while one recoils from the thought of uncounted billions of separate creations, of like units whose existence is not necessarily tied to that of all the other units-one recoils equally from the idea of a God like a queen bee perpetually laying electrons-nevertheless the only universal unity we know is that forced on us at the beginning by the fact that unanalysed experience is a continuum. Beyond this we can only claim that the mind demands unity for economy of explanation, and that the scientist's postulate of uniformity throughout the material universe seems to work, though with not a little creaking-consider, for instance, the fashion- able astronomical theories of matter compressed into alien forms in massive bodies, anid of stars scattering like the spores of an exploded puff-ball. There is a determination to find unity as fundamental and behind phenomenal multiplicity wherein metaphysician and physicist agree-it is perhaps the view in which they most obviously agree. But the metaphysician tends to look for a continuous and perhaps personal universal one, while the physicist tends to picture an integrated universe of tiny units all exactly alike. For myself I feel that the deepest need of the speculative mind is for ultimate unity. I find it impossible to conceive of the universe except as a real unity-real, organic, not merely a bag of articles bagged by my consciousness like the stars in the night sky--and not only real but alive. I feel as if I were a tree or a fountain, with my individuality in the air and sunshine, but my roots and source underground and a part of all of the rest of Nature.</page><page sequence="20">66 F. J. 0. CODDINGTON. If one goes to a zoo and contemplates not only the animals psychically somewhat like us, but the other living beings, strange and monstrous spiky fish, creatures like the termite and the weevil and the barnacle, flowers and fungi; if one looks through the microscope at still stranger specks of complex organism, more fantastic than any nightmare; one can attribute some kind of psychic life to all these- but how different from our own ! Few of us can realise how unimaginably different from ourselves are many others, or in what inconceivable private universes they have their being. But always I, for one, have the mystic sense of life, energy, psychic activity struggling upward to light, to thought, to integrated unified blossomung-and call it what you please, will, energy, electricity, life, the psychic, Nature, God, the Absolute-something vibrant and vital we cannot effectively name or describe or define that bubbles up ceaselessly everywhere and for ever.</page></plain_text>
