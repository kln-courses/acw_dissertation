<plain_text><page sequence="1">9 THE ANCIENT OIKOUMENR AS AN HISTORIC CULTURE AGGREGATE Huxley Memorial Lecture for 1945 By PROFESSOR A. L. KROEBER, PH.D. The one proper foundation of all broader studies in ethnology as in history, is the precise, intimate, long-continued examination of the culture of an area or a period. It is only upon such detailed examina- tions that sound comparisons and wide inferences may legitimately be based. My own lifework having been concerned primarily and often rather minutely with the indigenes of California, Zuni, and ancient Peru, I take that fact as justification for considering, on this occasion commemorative of Huxley, some general aspects of the long-term development of culture in the antipodal hemisphere. The Greeks gave the name Oik-oumene, 'the inhabited,' to their supposed total habitable world stretching from the Pillars of Hercules to the Indians and the Seres. Since centuries, of course, this term has proved no longer to correspond to its original extent of meaning. But the tract referred to by the Greeks does still correspond to a great historic unit, to a frame within which a particular combination of processes happened to achieve certain unique results. Especially, the forces at work there managed to achieve the most important forms of civilization as yet produced by mankind. The old name Oikoumene, with a partial shift of meaning from the ' range of mankind ' to 'range of man's most developed cultures,' thus remains a convenient designation for an interwoven set of happenings and products which are significant equally for the culture historian and the theoretical anthropologist. Cultural anthropology is a contextual study, at any rate so far as its orientation is historical. Obviously it is the placement of items, complexes, or constellations of culture in relatibon to the totality of known culture that gives them the fullest significance. It is only this sort of relating that can bring out the uniqueness, the individuality, or, respectively, the genericness or universality, of any one parcel or piece of culture. It is only by comparison-often, no doubt, an implicit process, and yet even then one of relating-that cultural values can be described, weighed and defined. While any national or tribal culture may and must for certain purposes be viewed and analysed by itself, I agree with my colleague Lowie that any such culture is necessarily in some degree an artificial unit segregated off for expediency and that the ultimate natural unit for ethnologists is ' the culture of all humanity at all periods and in all places.'1 Let this be my apology, if one is needed, for envisaging, not, indeed, the totality, but as large a sector of it as the millennially interrelated higher civilizations in the connected main land masses of the Eastern Hemisphere. I Some years ago, in a comparative examination of the-growth profiles of some principal aesthetic and intellectual activities, I arrived at the following summary of the histories of -high-level sculptures.2 There was first an early and intermittent activity, but prolonged forover two millennia, narrowly confined to the eastern end of the Mediterranean-Egypt to Mesopotamia. Around 600 B.C. this growth definitively collapsed, and Greek sculpture replaced it to the west and Persian to the east. This latter in turn was followed within a very few centuries by still more easterly developments arising in India and China. Just so, Greek sculpture, having about exhausted itself by late pre-Christian times, was succeeded in the earliest Christian era by Roman, centring one step or peninsula farther west. True, Roman sculpture is not generally rated among the very great arts. But it did contribute one innovation which has persisted: individual portrait realism; and it may therefore be reckoned into the company of its betters. Indian sculpture culminated by about A.D. 500, Chinese probably somewhat later, during the first half of T'ang. India had a series of more easterly colonial offshoots in Champa, Cambodia, Siam, and Java, whose zeniths fall variously between 700 and 1200. Chinese sculpture had its daughter- again farther east-in Japanese, which flourished a first time almost concurrently with the T'ang peak in the mother country, and once more-this time probably in apogee-in the twelve hundreds. By then, however, mediaeval ecclesiastic architectural sculpture was fully under way, centring in France, farther west and north in Europe than successful sculpture had ever before been developed; and this Gothic movement maintained itself until surpassed by the rising European Renaissance. It is evident that throughout this sequence each new important focus or climax of sculptural high productivity tended to lie more marginally, farther</page><page sequence="2">10 A. L. KROEBER out from the original centre. Eastward, we have successively Fertile Crescent, Persia, India, China, Colonial India, Japan; westward, Fertile Crescent, Crete, Greece, Rome, Atlantic Europe. The simile inevitably rises to mind of a spark somehow falling on a textile, slowly smouldering, and finally beginning to eat its enlarging way through the fabric, the greater intensity of combustion being always where the flame has reached only just lately; until the spatial frame of the cultural web is reached with, so to speak, the oceans. In presenting this picture of the spread of high- value sculpture, I observed that it was also the outline of the history of higher civilization ;3 and in an accentuated form-because sculpture as a single, limited activity ought to epitomize more sharply than the multiple composite of total culture. However, the same profile of events with its centrifugal trend recurs in other cultural productivities that are conveniently isolable-painting, for instance, and drama,4 and science, and probably technology- though in some cases the story begins later than for sculpture, and in others the early record is preserved only fragmentarily. Thus it is only lately beginning to be realized concretely to what extent Greek science rested on antecedents in the Fertile Crescent; and the successive culminations are, eastward: India, 500 or 600; China, 1300; Japan, 1700; while in the Occident our contemporary growth of science has only just completed its fourth centenary. This consistent expansion of spatial range in the successive moments of greatest creativeness of civilization removes the Oikoumene from the class of merely outworn or outmoded concepts-in fact, seems to validate it as having a modern significance of historic depth. What happened in eighteenth- century Japan was not irrelevant to what was happening in eighteenth-century Britain, secluded as the one society tried to be and self-centredly un- concerned as was the other. Their developments were mutually relevant because both these advancedly individuated civilizations, even more different in outlook than remote in their spatial placement, spring ultimately from the same root-stock of all higher civilization-or, let us say, root-stock of heightening civilization. In fact, the Pacific part of the World War which has just concluded may well be con- struable, in larger sweep, as a social disturbance due to the translation of the Occidental productive flame- front of civilization-or cutting edge, one might call it-its translation from Europe across America into the Pacific ;- to impinge there on the most actively intense Oriental periphery, which simultaneously is also trying to move beyond its previous confinement to the land mass of Asia, off the continent and into the Pacific. Because our planet is a globe, these two civilizational fronts, sometimes stationary, some- times creeping, sometimes leaping, have at last met; and some clash between them was probably inevitable. II Such reflections lead to another consideration. However we may define or reckon the larger civiliza- tions or cultures, the Islamic growth is certainly of their number. It manifests unusual cohesiveness and uniformity in spite of its vast spread; and it possesses not only a 'universal ' idea system or Church, to speak with Toynbee, but a universal language and writing in Arabic. Yet Islam lacks some of the most significant features of other great civilizations. It had no infancy and no real growth, but sprang up Minerva-like full-blown with the life of one man, something as German world-dominance would have sprung with the will of Hitler if it had become realized. The formally basic law of Islamic civiliza- tion is still coloured by the idiosyncrasies of the person Mohammed-his greeds, his astuteness, his amorousness, his practical wisdom and'fervour, his intellectual illiteracy. The religion which is the patent, spring and reason of Islamic civilization is not an enlargement of monotheistic Judaism and Christianity, but a reduction of them. There is nothing new, nothing specific to it, other than the accidents of the man Mohammed and his home town and the meteorite that once fell there. Ideologically, the peculiarities of Islam are restrictions. There are to be no idols, no other gods, no room for any Holy Ghost, Virgin, ot future Messiah; no wine, no gambling, no usury, no industry but by hand and for caches of coins or consumable luxury goods. Now, how could a Church whose only distinctive features were negations give rise to a civilization which has for a millennium and a third competed with the intrinsically so much richer ones of the West, of India, and of China-often successfully, as shown by its having gained territory from all three--and which is still maintaining itself ? There is no parallel in history. The explanation, or let us say part of it, seems to me to lie in the fact that Islam arose in the very region of that first hearth of all higher civilization- in the Near Eastern area of the Neolithic Revolution, of the first farming and towns and kings and letters. But it arose at a time when constructive cultural impulses had long since moved out from that hearth, had begun to move beyond Greece and Persia even; yet at a time when the Near East still lay covered with a detritus of forcibly imposed and presumably uncongenial Hellenic and Iranian civilization-a detritus that had long since become heavier and deader with each generation. There was apparently no longer any hope, in our seventh century, for a</page><page sequence="3">The Ancient Oikoumene as an Historic Culture Aggregate 11 really creative new great civilization-creative by the standard of total human culture-to spring up in this Nearer East, among the palimpsested, tired, worn societies of Egypt, Syria, or Mesopotamia. For that to happen would haye been, so to speak, to burn over again the ashes of the past. But there was a chance for a reduced, retractile civilization, an anti- Hellenic, anti-Sassanian, anti-Christian civilization, to throw off the foreign cultural yoke and to establish its own free society-without art, without much intellectual curiosity or profundity, without many of the aspirations customary in civilizations-but fervid bover its new autonomy and well satisfied at being at last able to impose its culture on others once more-no matter at what level-instead of having their culture and influence imposed upon it. Also it is probably no mere meaningless accident that the founder of this Church and State was no member of the age-old Egyptian or Syrian or Meso- potamian societies, but, to use a Toynbee concept once more, a member of the 'external proletariat '- external to those nationalities as well as to the Graeco- Roman imperium and the revived Iranian monarchy. Mohammed was of the Arab nation: that people which had then for three or four thousand years lived in a back alley around the corner from civiliza- tion. They were in touch with higher cultures, but not partaking of them; until at last they had come to prefer to avoid the responsibilities of being civilized. With that they had remained ignorant, renegade, illiterate, poverty stricken in possessions as in ideas; but proud and covetous and untamed and tumultuous. They were a proletariat-not, indeed, dulled with oppressive toil in metropolises, but of the waste places, and passionate of an empty freedom and spiritual beggary. Mohammed appeared and gave them a society and civilization of novel cast. The civilization was new precisely in its proletarianisms : its appeal to the common denominators and therefore to the common- nesses of men; its discarding of much of the heritage of the past; its simplification of ideas; its levelling and denunciations; its long list of prohibitions. The new society asked little else of its members than adherence; but for that it offered unity, success, power, and wealth. In consequence the old Iranian civilization of Mesopotamia and Persia was overthrown as it were overnight, and soon destroyed. Christian society, though larger, lost Syria and Egypt to the Arabs just as quickly and permanently. Subsequently, impetus carried Islamic culture to Spain and India, to Anatolia, to the Balkans and the East Indies. But its permanent homeland, the area within which it made such constructive contributions to total human civilization as it did make, remained the Near East, the stretch from Egypt to Persia. Elsewhere it influenced, here, some oppressed strata of India; there, certain neglected frontier populations of China; and backward and limited peoples like Malayans, Turks, Sudanese, and negroes. For a world civilization extending across a hemi- sphere, the cultural contributions of Islam are signalized by the meagreness already remarked upon. Reference is to innovations, additions, advances: it is obvious that so far as concerns their own survival, Islamic society and civilization were definitely successful for a thousand years-they probably still are gaining ground among retarded and disadvantaged populations. Islamic architecture was Roman. Repre- sentative art was banned. Purely decorative pattern- ing-the name Arabesque is characteristic-provided only a lower-level substitute. Islamic philosophy and science were basically those of the Greeks. It seems likely that we over-estimate their achievements through contrast with the still lower level of European philosophy and science between, say, 700 and 1100. This Occidental Christian retardation was presumably due to the geographical factor of distance: France is more remote than Arabia from the centres of origins at Ur and Memphis, as, well as from the later outposts of Edessa, Alexandria, and Byzantium. Our insistent habit of seeing all science as a one-line development from the Greeks to ourselves makes the Arabic bridge across the edge of the Western Slough of Despond loom more impressive than it actually was. Politically, also, Islam evolved nothing new, nor economically; nor, it seems, technologically much of first consequence. At any rate, it is difficult to name one important device or machine indubitably invented by Muslims.5 Even the acceptance of certain utilities, like printing and playing cards, was definitely blocked there by taboos meant to hedge in the Koran. This is an atmosphere hardly favourable to invention. The cultural activity in which the Mohammedan society may claim genuinely high rank on its own initiative and merit is literature. Poetry was a pre- Mohammedan Arab achievement, with forms of its own, such as rhyme and quantity; and with a stylized content and even a standard, pan-Arabic dialect of its own. This poetry must have possessed a quite extraordinary vigour and appeal; for it succeeded in transmitting much of its form and style across the barrier of speech diversity to the Persian language, and ultimately to Turkish. This is the more remarkable in that the Iranian peoples, producers and possessors of an empire and a religious philosophy for twelve hundred years, had all this time remained without the faculty of expressing themselves in a successful national literature; but finally did achieve it under the stimulus or prod of</page><page sequence="4">12 A. L. KROEBE: 'the Arabic example. They perhaps even surpassed their model in quality, and at any rate in range. This unparalleled Persian event seems intelligible (only in terms of Arab poetry being the one vigorously creative activity of culture which Near Eastern society possessed at the moment of its Islamization. All the other activities that went into it were either crude through stripping down, or old and fossilized, or were incorporated like foreign bodies. For instance, as just said, Greek science and philosophy were given their mediaeval interpretation later- in Latin Europe than in Arabic countries. Yet this interpretation served in the Christian West as the stimulus for an independent rewqrking of both science and philosophy on thoroughly original lines and more productively in the centuries since the Renaissance; whereas contemporaneously a long intellectual night settled on Islam. The argument, in fine, is that Islamic society was effective and prospered because it reduced and simplified culture, and that this contraction was necessary for any civilization which was to succeed, within the long-worked and worn 'heart area' of higher civilization, at a time when the crucial front, the firing line, of innovating and progressing civiliza- tion had long since moved out beyond the Near East. This inference in turn validates the concept of an historically interconnected totality of culture through- out the main mass of the Eastern Hemisphere-the old range of the Oikoumene: not only as a fancy in which we may indulge if inclination so leads us, but as a tool which should be included in intellectual operations if our aim is the completest possible understanding of the highly complex history of civilization. III In all cultural comparisons-and increasingly so as the area or duration is greater-three aspects of phenomena are involved. These are, first, the cultural content, which may remain identical, or nearly the same, wherever it is carried. Second, there is the form of culture, or its style, which varies both regionally and temporally. This is the pervasive factor which gives to the culture of, say, China a different total quality from that of India or Western Europe; which endows it with a distinctive colour or cast that may be maintained for thousands of years, even though it is of the essence of such national styles that they cannot be arrested, but must change. Third is the consideration of the values of the contents 'and styles achieved. These values vary not only, between different content-assemblages each held together by a style-in other words, different civilizations-but between successive periods or phases of the- same civilization. It is such values, essentially, that are being dealt with in the con- sideration of the wanderings of high-level sculpture, or productive science, as just referred to. What a world like the Oikoumen8 can share in common, to a large extent, is cultural content; though its regions can never share identical content so long as they are regionally diverse in style or form. This is because a style or manner must always be partly dependent on its content, and at the same time must select and determine its characteristic content, so far as selectivity is open to it. Styles or civilizations may accordingly run partly parallel and may present analogies, but they tend to remain individuated; whereas their total contents tend to assimilate, through the inclination of cultural items to interchange and spread when not prevented. Values, finally, seem quite particularly limited and transient. The higher the values, the more rarely are they being produced, and, we may infer, the more rarely do they stimulate further value production. But the already cited slow wanderings of the foci of value productivity do also seem to have a definite reference to the Oikoumene as a unit totality. Since, however, the highest-level value productivities have a very specific relation to the growth of styles in civilizations, which we may in turn regard as particularly individuated pattern constructs of selected culture content, it is evident that all three aspects- content, style, and value-are involved in under- standing what happened and is happening in the Oikoumene. Empirically and inductively the first approach to such understanding, or at least the simplest, would seem to be through an examination of the degree to which the content of culture in the Oikoumene tends to spread and uniformize. IV Let us therefore review some of the cultural material which became shared across the breadth of our Oikoumene, how it became shared, and what happened to it in the process. We may pass over as familiar the group of basic subsistence and survival techniques which were devised in the time just before and after the invention of writing and of history. Such are the artificial growing of the fundamental large-field food crops such as barley, wheat, and millet; the domesticated breeding of cattle, sheep, pigs, and other animals; metallurgical processes connected first with copper- bronze, and then with iron-steel. The origin of most of these techniques is in current opinion placed somewhere in or near South-Western Asia, with a spread thence into China, India, nearer Africa, and Europe. For China, the comparative tardiness of arrival of these fundamental contributions is attested negativelv rather than positively. Our earliest</page><page sequence="5">The Ancient Oikoumene as an Historic Culture Aggregate 13 knowledge of them there is later-usually considerably later-than in Western Asia; but archweological search began more recently and our recovered story is shorter in China. And there have probably been gratuitous exaggerations of the shortness, like Bishop's claim of the absence of the cattle-drawn plough from China before the fourth century B.C.6 This is a , question which only Sinologists are competent to settle. Witness the repeated mentions of ploughing in the translations of the Shih Ching well anterior to that century :7 philological experts must say what the words translated there as plough really mean. An anthropologist may only hazard the general estimate that the fourth century seems unduly late for a people finally to accept the ox-drawn plough who had long had its customary associations of broadcast-sown grains and cattle and vehicles and a dense population and cities and organized govern- ment. In addition to the basic plants and animals which have longest been shared by East and West, there are those like rice and sugar cane which are limited to southern ranges, or like buckwheat to northerly or elevated ones, and which spread intercontinentally later or more slowly or perhaps sporadically. Among animals, the hen, though first attached to man in the Far Eastern tropics, proved to be little limited by climate; but the reindeer was definitely so limited. In fact, this sole member of the Cervidae to be usefully domesticated, though its range is inter- continental also, has always been kept only beyond the pale of higher civilization, as a surrogate among the backward, and among the less fortunately situated, for the more valuable cow or horse. The totality of reindeer culture thus gives a strong impression of being an adaptive marginal reflection. The theory that all pastoral life commenced with the reindeer seems to be a turn of fancy more interested in discovering the unexpected than the likely. The bred horse, though its precise origins remain as indefinite in time and place as those of most domesticated animals and plants, is of interest as one of a small group of culture acquisitions which may well have been made in inner Asia. An institution shared by East and West, with the record as usual earlier in the West, is divinity of kingship, with its appanages on the one hand of retainer burial and on the other of corvees or mass labour conscription for construction of dykes, canals, walls, palaces, temples and tombs. Abandonment of retainer burial seems to have occurred relatively late in China and later in Japan.8 It is even p'ossible that the practice had been given up in Mesopotamia and Egypt before it became established in the Far East. Of particular interest is eunuchism, which can be traced back about four millennia in Mesopotamia as a ritual mutilation. This practice, however, seems not to have spread widely beyond its West Asiatic 6rigin. Harem eunuchism apparently is a later institution; it is found well established in China of Chou times, and may be older than that. There is room and need for a scholarly comparative study of eunuchism, with emphasis on its functions and associations rather than on its mere fact, and with reference also to the documentable history of animal castration. Eunuchism became established in Byzantine Christian Constantinople and in Mohammedan Osmanli Constantinople, but never got a real foothold in Occidental civilization. This means, almost certainly, that it struck a definite resistance. It also never crossed the Strait of Tsushima from Korea to Japan. Here, then, we have an institution which was able to traverse the main breadth of Eurasia at a fairly early time, but did not succeed in penetrating the two extreme peripheries. The cause of the double check is perhaps that the peripheries began to participate in higher civilization late enough for human mutilation to be on the decline or defensive, if not yet wholly outmoded; much like other mutilations, human sacrifice, taboos of parturitional, menstrual, and mortuary defilement, and other social recognitions or emphases of the human body and its physiology. In China, India, Western Asia, eunuchism had long been intertwined with the pomp and prestige of royalty, and maintained itself-in China until 1911; but taste, let us call it, had advanced too far in the Oikoumene generally for it to gain any new ground in Europe and Japan at relatively late dates. There is a group of systems of magico-ritual practice which are now generally accepted as being the results each of a single, interconnected growth in the Eastern Hemisphere, especially since they have no strict counterparts in the Western Hemisphere, or only much slighter ones. These systems include the Blood Sacrifice complex; Divination from parts of animals; Astrology; and Alchemy. The Sacrifice complex involves not only the taking of animal life in religious offering, but also the shedding of blood; the consumption of the flesh largely by the worshippers, until sacrifice to the gods and meat- feast become near-equivalents; and the associated dedication, and again consumption, of fermented drink. Fifty years ago we were still unaware of the full potentialities of the method of 'probability history' as it operates with the indirect evidence of occurrences in supplement to the direct testimony of historic statements. The resemblances of the sacri- fices of pagan tribes in Borneo and Luzon, of Lolos in Yiinnan, of backward groups in British India, of West African negroes, to the hecatombs of Homer and the burnt offerings of Aaron in Leviticus, at that</page><page sequence="6">14 A. L. KROEBER time seemed due rather to something emerging from men's make-up spontaneously, without reference to time and place and circumstances, and hence outside the specific concatenations of history. Now, in 1946, few if any would doubt the high probability of all these cases being interderived, at least through the whole breadth of the Eastern Hemisphere; and if the Americas are provisionally excluded, it is because corresponding occurrences there are fewer, more spotty, and less closely parallel in detail. Divination follows a variety of techniques; but at least those which specifically operate with parts of animals, seem again to form a true system. These include examination of entrails, especially of the liver or bile sac of victims; interpretation of heat- produced cracks in shoulder blades of deer or sheep, carapaces of tortoises, and the like; or of the pattern of bristles slid into the foramina of thigh bones. The very arbitrariness of these techniques, coupled with the frequency of the association with sacrifice, practically precludes any random or spontaneous causality; as does their absence from native America, except for an extension of scapulimancy alone across its subarctic north.9 Divination from the behaviour of tame or wild birds may be a related branch technique. But the throwing or drawing of lots, scrying, and such rest on different principles, follow separate techniques, and presumably have only a logical or psychological connection, not an histirical one. The basic origins of Astrology must be ascribed to West Asia, especially to Mesopotamia. It was developed further in Alexandria, as by the addition of the week; and having entered the later Helleno- Roman culture, was transmitted to both the Occi- dental and Islamic civilizations. Similarly, the system spread eastward to India and its derivative cultures, where, for instance, our weekdays figure conspic,uously, not with reference to a day of rest or ritual service, but for horoscopes and determination of the fortune of individuals. This diffusion spread with little diminution as far as Bali, that easternmost remnant-refuge of directly mediaval Hinduism. Into the Chinese sphere, on the other hand, our week, like our zodiac, did not seriously penetrate. Geomancy, the interpretation of the supernatural influences of heaven and earth, or wind and water, feng shui, took its place. Geomancy had a different ideology and different techniques from Astrology. Feng shui, incidentally, was carried to Annam and Korea ;10 but its hold in Japan seems to have been transient and rather light.11 Alchemy, that 'immature chemistry of the Middle Ages,' with its Graco-Arabic name, also received its first Western formulation at Alexandria, shortly after Astrology, but it may be Far Eastern in origin, as Seligman has already, though somewhat diffidently, suggested.12 The gap in space between East and West is greater than the interval between the times of appearance there. But the basic ideas of alchemy as a system of magic or false science-the making of gold from base metals, the use of an elixir not only to do this, but to prolong life into immortality, the claim to association with a profound but hidden philosophy-all these are already well developed in China in Early Han times.13 This is earlier than any specific record which I have been able to find for the West. If the leap from Ch'ang-an to Alexandria, seems long for it to have been made in a century or two, I can only plead that so much other cultural freight was evidently, first and last, carried over this route, and some of it at almost express speeds, that absence of knowledge of the intermediate stations, of the rate of transmittal, or of the asso- ciations or manner of the spread-such ignorance ig not too serious a deterrent of acceptance of the connection as more probably indicated than not, in view of the high incompleteness of the total record in the premises anyhow. It has often been remarked that the period of the sixth century B.c.-or possibly a two to three hundred- year block enclosing some point in that century-pro- duced Lao Tze and Confucius, Buddha and probably Zoroaster, as well as Thales and his nearer successors in Greek philosophy to Plato. Also it is clear that by 200 B.C. creativeness was either definitely past or rapidly ending in all of these growths. The reason for the coincidence might be', first, 'accidental ', that is, diverse causes happening to produce similar effects contemporaneously. Second, it might be some as yet undefined, underlying major current or immanence; which would be akin to a telic destiny. Third, it might be a specific antecedent which had not long before managed to become realized in all the areas-say, something of the order of the estab- lishment of letters, though that example does not too well fit the case. Fourth, there might have been a direct spread, by contagion, of a spirit of inquiry, of an attitude demanding a reasoned system of thinking instead of the medley which tradition- alism has a way of accumulating. It is perhaps not yet possible to choose with positiveness between these several alternatives. A few years ago I examined the first three of them.14 I now add diffusion as a fourth possible explanation because of what seem the undoubted intercontinental spreads of blood sacrifice and organ divination which preceded and those of astrology and alchemy which immediately succeeded. At any rate the sequence of ideologies quite clearly was : (1) a cult of magical ritual directed toward the sensory appeasement and favour of anthropomorphic powers; followed in reaction by</page><page sequence="7">The Ancient Oikoumene as an Historic Culture Aggregate 15 (2) a depersonalized, largely de-animized, pragmatic, investigatory way of thinking; but this again soon followed in counter-reaction by (3) a pair of parallel systems of re-animized imitations of science. All three steps had a distribution from the Mediterranean to the Pacific. If the first and third were due to diffusion, as is perhaps generally accepted, there would be some presumption of diffusion having been operative also for the in-between phase. It must be admitted that the spread of an attitude of mind is not quite the same as the spread of a congeries of specific ritual practices or magical beliefs. But it seems warranted to submit the tentative suggestion. V Let us review some more specific or tangible items of culture content. Cavalry.-We have seen that it is modern conven- tion-or- inference from absence of evidence-to attribute the taming of the horse to Central Asiatics. Both to the West and the East, the animal was first driven, then ridden. War chariots precede cavalry. The latter comes on the historic scene in the West toward 700 in Assyria, in China not until nearly 300 B.C. The Persians retained obsolescent chariots, in addition to cavalry, until Alexander. In India, though Poros and Chandragupta already had horse- men, chariots lingered on, at least for officers, until Harsha of the seventh century.15 Stirrups.-The stirrup saddle comes to the surface of history about simultaneously in Constantinople around 580 and in China possibly in a mention of 477 and indubitably at Ch'ang-an in T'ai Tsung's grave reliefs in 649.16 The second-century reliefs from Shantung show saddles, but no stirrups. An invention of the stirrup neither in the East nor the West, but in Central Asia, is possible, but present data are too few to permit even a probable designation of the locus of origin. Money.-Disc coinage spread rapidly from seventh- century Lydia. It had become established in both India and China before 300 B.C., other shapes being superseded in China during the foliowing century. As for the peripheries, Celtic Gaul was coining distorted imitations of Macedonian staters in the second century B.C. and Britain in the first; but Japan did not mint until A.D. 708. This disparity seems to reflect a general precocity of economic and technical aspects of culture in the marginal west, a retardation in Japan, as compared with the develop- ment of letters, arts, religion, and refinement generaliy. Water Mills.-Water wheels used as power for mills have their Western origin attributed to the first century B.C., probably in Hellenic Asia, with a spread to Italy in the next century.17 The Chinese credit the same invention to their Tu Yu about A.D. 260, with an improvement by Ts'ui Liang under the Wei dynasty, 386--532.18 India is said to have got its water-driven mills from a Persian sent by Constantine the Great. Legendary as some of these accounts may be, they all point to a period of a few hundred years within which the discovery might well have been transmitted. Felt.-Felt was thought by Lauferto have originated in inner Asia.19 This is unproved; but it is evident that both in material and in process the manufacture of felt would be more consonant with pastoral life than is loom-weaving. In any event, the occurrence of felt on both sides of Central Asia is old. The earliest Western record is Homeric; for both China and India there are mentions from the fourth century B.C.; reports and finds from Central Asia are, naturally enough, later. Cotton.-T,he basic textile fibres have changed surprisingly little and slowly in their areas, on the whole, except for the spread of cotton from India. Cotton, in the end, largely displaced wool in Meso-, potamia, linen in Egypt and Europe, hemp in China and Japan. Cotton is also-except for the gourd- the one plant cultivated both in the Old World and in the pre-Columbian New. Its abundant growth and use in Peru precedes that in either China or the 'West. Chess.-The game of chess originated in India, according to Middle and Near Eastern tradition, which is corroborated by the derivation of its Persian and Arabic names from Sanskrit chaturanga. The earliest datable Indian reference is from just after A.D. 600; by which time, however, chess is generally believed to have been already established in Persia. The Arabs took over the Persian game, played it almost unchanged for many centuries, developed champions, problems, and a literature, and passed it on to Western Christendom probably by 900. This date is indicated by the phonetic forms of the terms employed in the West; the earliest discovered documentary mention is from about 1010. The enlargement of range of the queen's and bishop's moves, the final major improvement, rendering the game more concentrated, occurred in Italy or possibly France or Spain about 1485. After this there were no further -hanges, except for finding a consensus among the fluctuating rules about castling and the taking of passing pawns. Byzantium knew chess by 800, under a name derived from the Persian, not Arabic pronunciation. Russia perhaps got the game via the Khazars rather than from Constantinople. Chinese, Korean, and Japanese chess are increasingly differentiated from the Indian and Western forms.</page><page sequence="8">16 A. L. KROEBER The game was known in China by 762; it appears to have been not yet known in Japan in the tenth century. Since chess is pre-European also among the Turkish, Mongol, Tibetan, Farther Indian, and west Indonesian peoples, it serves as an excellent criterion to define the range of the Oikoumene as -here dealt with. The most remote Asiatic tribes and the most backward interior ones, Oceanians beyond direct Indian and Islamic influences, and non-Islamic negroes do not play chess. Two other board games, backgammon or nard and merels, seem to have had a similarly penetrative distribution.20 The further items which might be cited as having long since spread across Eurasia are numerous. Falconry, the crossbow,21 gunpowder and firearms, the compass, the concept of the-dragon will all serve in illustration. Let us, however, pass on to some larger and more elusive complexes. VI Printing.-Seals, which in the Near East and India are immemorially ancient-almost as old as writing itself-are said not to have reached China until the third century B.C. Within a comparatively' short time-A.D. 105 is the conventional date-paper was invented in China, and therewith multiplication was made possible in place of authentication as the goal of all copy-producing devices; with the sequel that block-printing began to be operative within about six 'centuries, and movable type printing within another four. Playing cards and paper money were accompaniments.22 The course of paper manufacture, and less continuously of single-sheet block printing, has been traced from China through Central Asia into Muslim Irak, Egypt, and Morocco, and from there into Catholic Europe. Cards appeared suddenly in Western Europe four centuries after their mention in China.23 There is almost certainly a connection. Possibly Islam, though it forbade avowed acceptance of the gaming apparatus, managed to transmit it. Type printing also began in Europe four centuries later than in China.24 In this case direct derivation is extremely uncertain, for a variety of reasons: mechanical difference in the problem to be met, due to the deep difference of systems of writing; difference of material of the types, of kind of ink, of the manner of impressing; and, above all, the complete" non- participation of the intervening Islamic world. For this non-participation, the negative evidence is in this case overwhelmingly compelling. In fact, Islamic non-participation in printing soon became- a hostility which continued-with the exception of one history issued in 1729-until 1825.25 Royal Tombs.-Quite recently Gordon Childe has enunciated as an empirical archaeological finding that 'with progress in civilization a dwindling proportion of society's growing wealth has been devoted to the preparation of tombs and their furnishing.'26 Apparent exceptions are 'royal tombs ' since the Bronze Age on or in which was lavished ' a quite substantial proportion of their occupants' wealth.' These occur in Egypt of the first four dynasties; in Kish and Ur; and they include Mycenaean shaft graves and tholoi, Kuban, Kerma in Nubia, German barrows, Celtic chariot-burials and Viking ship-burials, and Shang tombs at Anyang. In all cases, Childe finds, such tombs reflect recent and rapid accumulation of wealth and transition to a new socio-political structure, due to foreign commerce and contact with higher civilization; and by contrast the tombs of later kings and chiefs are more modest, even though the wealth of the living community had become greater. This conclusion seems equivalent to the definition of a general or near-universal ' stage ' of development such as indeed Childe devoted his Huxley Lecture of 1944 to expounding.27 Never- theless, it is also the affirmation of a single historical continuity, the spread of a specific practice which we may call 'first-flush display-wealth burial '-an irregular, spasmodic, but persistent spread out from the Fertile Crescent to North-Western Europe on one side and China on the other. And, again, it is a phenomenon of the same order as the development of fully liberated and self-sufficient sculpture or drama, or the birth of formal philosophies, which have already been discussed. Christianity and Buddhism.-The mechanisms and apparatus shared by Christianity and Buddhism are familiar. With Buddhism originating in Northern India and spreading into Eastern Asia, these resem- blances involve a continuity of distribution from Atlantic to Pacific, only partly interrupted by a subsequent Mohammedan wedge. The common elements include the following. Above all there is organized monasticism, including nunneries, with similar seclusion, conduct of life, and vows, extending even to details like begging' and tonsure; and in earlier periods hermits or anchorites. Then there is the use of bells, candles, and rosaries in worship; the nimbus or halo in art; and relics and pilgrimages.- Next, the notion of paradise and of hell-technically, perhaps, only purgatories, but filled with flames and devils. To this last dualistic concept an Iranian origin is generally ascribed, and it reached the Mediterranean barely in time for absorption into Christianity; but it entered Buddhism secondarily and late, as something really contradictory of the original ideology. Also, the strains of Buddhism chiefly affected were the northwestern and landward- travelling Mahayana and Lamaism varieties, with their greater exposure to both Iranian and Christian contacts. A derivative item is the saying of ' masses '</page><page sequence="9">The Ancient Oikoumene as an Historic Culture Aggregate 17 for the souls of the dead. In the areas of both religions, the first block-prints were the product of an effort to furnish the multitude of the pious with a cheap means of permanent* edification through picture or legend or both.28 Some of these similarities may be superficial or even verbal rather than intrinsic, and others may be the results of independent convergence. It seems unlikely that all of them are such, because too few crop up in other religions, except for Taoist imitations of Buddhism. Islam, for instance, consciously rejected most of the elements in question. Few of them seem to gave got a lodgment in national religions like Shinto, Judaism, Parseeism. Again, few appear in the older Mediterranean national cults, which at least in their later history overlapped in time with Buddhism. Grammar.-The first discovery of grammar may be attributed to India. A seeming rediscovery was made on the Greek language a little later. We know something of the stages of this rediscovery. It was three centuries in the making, and therefore looks like an autochthonous evolution. But the total record shows that grammars are likely to be formu- lated in imitation of existing grammars, and by bilingual speakers. This is clear for Latin, Syriac, Arabic, Hebrew, and all European vernaciilars. Without exception the grammars of these languages are, historically, only adaptations of Greek grammar to a new body of speech-or of a derivative from Greek. Similarly, Chinese phonetics, including tone recognition, was worked out in the last three pre- T'ang centuries, the period of greatest Buddhist and Indian influence in China. 'Similarly, too, Motoori's traditional invention of Japanese grammar in 1779 followed on two centuries of possible exposure to Latin grammar through Jesuits or Hollanders. It may therefore be that the final Greek formulation was also made under some degree of stimulation from India; especially as it was made as late as the second century B.c. by non-Greeks in Anatolia and Egypt. If there was such stimulation, theie must have existed threads of connection running below the surface evidence of recorded history.29 To reknit such putative threads is obviously a difficult and risky undertaking, calling for the most sensitive tact. If nevertheless I maintain the suggestion, it is because of the group of recurrences which obtrude analogous suggestions: the sixth-century philosophies, alchemy and astrology, monasticism-for that matter blood sacrifice and organ divination, perhaps even wrting as such. Nineteenth-century anthropologists could still fall back on a sort of spontaneous generation to explain cultural likenesses remote in space or time. Today we hesitate to invoke autogenesis: we shrink from it almost as fervently as do biologists. Partly this is because absences of potentials have acquired for us almost the same evidential weight as occurrences of actuals. The result is that specific universals in human culture have shrunk to be vanishingly few. There is thus as much evidence needed for an assump- tion of independent origins as of a connection: the burden of proof is equal. In practice, we make decisions first on the degree of part-for-part homologous resemblance of the seeming parallels; and perhaps even more largely on the size of the space and tinme interval, with a heavy sidelong look at the number and firmness of other threads spun across it. Yet these procedures often leave us facing a dilemma, even when the total context of a situation leaves little moral doubt of there having been a connection of some sort. Was the connection due to a conscious and specific imitation of something foreign, though perhaps also with deliberate adaptation to a different environment.? Or was it an ideational germ which was transported and which slumbered, perhaps for centuries, until its environment awoke it-possibly through the environment having been mellowed by enough other consciously imitative imports or enough sprouting of other germs ? There evidently exists a twilight zone of historic parallels in which there is no available evidence whatever of imitative adoption, but in which the total precedent of experience makes independent repetition of origin extremely improbable. The temporary verdict may often have to be: "Nothing provable". But the problem remains to vex and intrigue us. And the situations suggest that if we knew more about indirect or delayed transmissions between cultures, and about the effect of cumulative impact of previous transmissions on later ones, many of these twilight cases might resolve themselves into reasonable clarity. VII On the basis of the foregoing illustrations and analyses, the Oikoumene may perbaps be redefined as a great web of culture growth, extensive in area and rich in content. Within this web or historic nexus, first of all, inventions or new cultural materials have tended to be transmitted, sooner or later, from end to end. This is true even though the major styles of civilization in the Oikoumene have long persisted in their individuations: culture in China, for instance, was already characteristically Chinese 3,000 years ago. Second, new ways of thinking, or sets of specific practices rooting in an idea-complex or attitude, have shown a tendency to propagate themselves acrposs the long stretch of the area, sometimes rapidly, almost like a wave or pulsation. a</page><page sequence="10">18 A. L. KROEBER Finally, the primitives in the area, or adjoining it, derive their cultures mainly from the civilization characteristic of the Oikoumene as a whole, through reductive selection. They preserve old elements largely discarded elsewhere, and do without elements which their retardation makes them unable or unwilling to accept. Basically, however, these retarded or primitive cultures in or adjacent to the Oikoumene are fully intelligible only in terms of 'CEcumenical' civilization. They usually add to what they share some lesser measure of their own proper peculiarities and originations, and they have often developed a distinctive style of their own. But in the main these backward cultures depend and derive from the greater ones whose nexus we have been considering. Perhaps that is why it does not seem to matter unduly whether they are geograph- ically interior or marginal: the relation remains equally one of dependence. For example, a people like the Lolo of Yiinnan and Szechwan illustrate by the very diversity of relation of the content -of their culture how completely this is enmeshed in the greater web. Lolo speech is composed of monosyllabic tonal elements as the result either of being cognate with Sino-Tibetan or influenced -by it. Lolo writing seems built on a Chinese model, but with reduction to fewer strokes in characters, progress from left to right, and genuinely phonetic syllabic character.30 The Lolo themselves deriv'e it traditionally from Confucius's 'left-hand script.' It is used only by the p'i-mo priests to help them remember prayers and spells; but the ritual includes some Taoist deities and texts. 'There are obvious relatioils with Farther India and the East Indies in the Lolo iron-pointed lance and machete, in the manner of blacksmithing these and farm tools, in the bamboo houses laid and lashed together, in palm-fibre raincoats, in divination with cock femora. Ties with Inner and Northern Asia appear in the growing of buckwheat and oats, the use of wool, the presence of a ' blapk-boned ' aristocracy, and inspira- tional shamans who are often women and beat the drum left-handedly. American staples, both maize and potatoes, have been introduced via undetermined Asiatic neighbours. Also Lolo, but indeterminate as regards origin, because of their wide spread, are blood sacrifice of cocks and pigs, eating of the victims' flesh, libations of alcoholic drink to the four directions, shoulder-blade divination. Here and there in the inventory a local, possibly indigenous, trait crops up, positive or negative: say, pulverization of dried meat or absence of pottery.31 The number of such- peculiar or original elements appears to be quite small in the total. Such poverty of unique traits usually proves to hold when we have wide enough comparative knowledge, whoever the people in question. But it is the geographical range and the multiplicity of relations and derivations of Lolo culture which are specially impressive and which illustrate not only the nature, but the functioning of the large growth of civilization with which we are dealing. A similar case could be made out for the Todas, that small caste with its highly specialized culture; except that the Toda position near the tip of the Indian sub-continent has made all relations with the world first pass through a specific Indian filter. As we pass 'upward' to peoples like, say, Naga., Shan, Fulah, Ashanti, Kurds, Lapps, it is evident that there exists a transition from societies having only their 'folk-culture' to others possessing also additional and increasing measures of sophistication or literary culture or participation in a universal Church; until, when one of these latter constituents is well marked, the adhesion of the people in question to some great civilization, and through it to the international cecumenical culture, is evident. The difference between the many tribes and nations within the geographical range of the Oikoumene is not that the backward populations among them have been exempt from the influences of this mass of culture, but that they have failed to be reached strongly by its later, more advanced, or more effort-demanding layers and waves, or have managed to resist them. Among the very 'lowest' units, such as Vedda, Bushman, Sakai, Aeta, it would seem that their status of cultural poverty is mainly the result of a negative selectivity due to a psychological attitude, circularly reinforced by habits of a mode of living. To infer, as is frequently done implicitly, that these peoples stiLl are basal 'primitives' through having somehow remained such automatically for the last ten thousand years, completely insulated or in a geographical vacuum, seems contrary to the probability of our total experience of history. What- ever may have been their motivation, or the fortunes to which they were subject, these tribes have escaped the brunt of impact of the main mass of worild culture; and either by their own endeavours. or by fate they have largely managed to keep their culture at maximal meagreness. Comparative analysis of such content as it has, however, would regularly show, I believe, that this content is widely shared and is therefore to be construed as derivatively secondary, not primarily original.32 VIII How far is it reasonable and profitable to draw the limits of our Oikoumene ? Australia may fairly be' omitted from it, in the main. There are some evidences of percolations; but the significant fact seems to be the degree to</page><page sequence="11">The Ancient Oikoumene as an Historic Culture Aggregate 19 which percolations have failed. Warner's analysis of the long-term ineffectiveness of known Malaysian relations with the Murngin33 seems highly typical in this connection. I would be inclined to project it as a fair sample typical of Australian indigenous history in general. New Guinea is more transitional; there are Australian features, but also Melanesian and probably Indonesian ones. Melanesia, in turn, has certainly had some impact of historical forces from the Oikoumene, as indicated by its pigs and shell-money transactions and pottery. But it appears also to have rioted in local specializations and luxuriances of plans of social structure whose bases perhaps reach back to pre- or proto-cecumenical days. Polynesia stands in an unusual position. Distance and environ- ment, especially that of low and small islands, have deprived it of rice, metals, the loom, usually pottery, and other technologies and economies. But the culture was not seeking retraction, and therefore it managed to keep, and sometimes to develop further, its attitudes and ideologies, especially its philosophic, mythologic, literary, and hierarchical ones. South Africa, like Australia, points spatially away from the main land mass. But it lies widely open to it, though separated by a tropical belt, and with its extreme at considerable distance. Perhaps it would be reasonable to construe that Southern Africa was considerably more a part of the Oikoumene than was Australia, but that its relations were irregular, inter- mittent, and retarded, especially until rather recently. Native America, like every other area, has un- doubtedly experienced some connections with Eurasia, both early and late. All in all, however, its culture has evidently both developed and crystallized in- dependently of that of the Oikoumene. The New World possesses its own heartland of higher civiliza- tion, stretching from Central Mexico to somewhat beyond Peru. The axis of this cultural Nuclear America is oriented without reference to that of the ancient Oikoumens. It is both well separated from it and pointed in different direction. We are beginning to be able to trace a few of the pulsations within this American heartland as well as some of those emanating from it; and they do not correspond with those of the Oikoumene-neither in specific content nor in time nor with spatial continuity. Characteristic diffusions within Nuclear America are metallurgy, many cultivated plants, pyramids, masonry, a calendar; out of it, into the peripheries, probably pottery, -loom weaving, maize, head trophies, direc- tional and other ritual symbolism. Since Boas, we have been in the habit of citing the absence of plough, wheel, iron, stringed instruments, and proverbs from pre-Columbian New MTorld cultures. We might now add, as theoretically achievable in the relatively advanced Nuclear civilization, but actually lacking from it: philosophy, alchemy, writing, money, monasticism, organ divination, eunuchism, games of mental skill. And while blood sacrifice and a sort of astrology occur, it is with quite diverse concrete expression. Northern North America has obviously received by import from Asia a series of items, such as the composite bow, slat armour, conical tents, scapuli- mancy, bear rituals, the shamanistic tambourine drum, the magic flight story, and perhaps all told some dozens more. But these are disparates. They are not held in any one nexus or woven into an ideology or style. Therefore their very presence, with the concurrent absence of systematically organized culture of Old World origin, militates against construal of northerly America as a passage- way for historic continuity between the Oikoumene and Nuclear America. At any rate there clearly was no corridor of transmission corresponding in kind, or even seriously in degree, to the way in which, say, Turkestan has functioned as a conduit between the developed West and developed China. I would not deny that first and last a great many seeds of culture passed, by land or by sea, from Asia to this or that part of the Americas, and that some proportion of them germinated, or at least stimulated new growths on the soil. This would be in addition to such stock of basic knowledge as the first populators of the New World, or perhaps the several waves of such, brought with them. Yet the story of major civilizational growth in America, as we are beginning to adumbrAte its totality in outline, gives no indication of integrating with the corresponding story in Eurasia. The two are not, so far as we can yet see, parts of a single plot. Resemblances are either analogies instead of homologies; or, where they are the latter, they are also disjecta membra.34 We have perhaps seemed to travel a long way. And yet the speed of diffusibility of culture content is so great under optimum conditions that the period of half a dozen millennia which we have been con- sidering would have sufficed for particular items- say like smoking or coffee-to have spread around the planet again and again and again. What counts for total comprehension of the story of man's doings, however, is not these flashing meteoric bits, but the concatenated masses of culture and the interrelations of these-interrelations of transmittal and absorption of content, along with regroupinig and refashioning according to national and supernational style of civilization. It is in connection with the under- standing of major drifts such as these that the concept is here submitted of an Oikoumene consisting of a specific, preponderant, interwoven, definable mass of culture charged with a modern significance additional to the original socio-geographical designation in which culture reference was at best only implicit. a2</page><page sequence="12">20 A.

The classical organization of Indian armies was into infantry, elephants, cavalry, and chariots. Chess derived its name from this fourfold division.

It flourished in Islam, although its permissibility was long under debate (like that of coffee after 1500). According to one accepted tradition, Mohammed held that a believer should restrict his amusements to his horse, his bow, and his wife (p. 189)- an almost crass exemplification of the contractile bent of Islam discussed above. In medieval Latin Christendom chess was an upper-class pastime; among the Greeks, it encountered entrenched Church opposition and languished; in Russia, at any rate after the fifteenth century, it was more widely played than in Western Europe. In China and Japan chess has always been less esteemed, that is, has had lower social class associations, than the ' enclosing game.' 21 C. M. Wilbur, 'The History of the Crossbow, Illustiated from Specimens in the U.S. National Museum,' Smithsonian Reportfor 1936 (1937), pp. 427-438, summarizes the principal comparative data, which give priority to China: probable mention fourth century B.C.; certain mention, third century, and again Former Han; preserved trigger blocks of bronze, Han; Rome, first mention c. A.D. 386; representations. perhaps fifth century. The European crossbow of steel, necessitating a windlass or goat's foot lever to draw, dates only from the fourteenth century. Wilbur sees 'nothing but negative evidence for the whole region of Central Asia and the Near East ' until the sixteenth century. 22 All the data are of course from T. F.
