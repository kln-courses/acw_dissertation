<plain_text><page sequence="1">RITUAL PARALLELS IN PUEBLO AND PLAINS CULTURES, WITH A SPECIAL REFER- ENCE TO THE PAWNEE' BY ELSIE CLEWS PARSONS NOW and again the Pueblo student may have asked himself whether certain Pueblo traits do not carry a suggestion of Plains culture. The fetich bundles of the western pueblos, the behavior of the Clown societies, the tribal societies of the Hopi, the chiefly police system of the Tanoans, the directional corn-named groups of Isleta, the scalp dance of Zufii, the summer camp of Taos, herein are to be found various aspects of Plains life. Yet the ritual emphasis, the ceremonial complexes, the social values at large, of the Pueblos vary so much from those of the Plains tribes that suggestions of parallelism must have been lightly dismissed, at least so I presume, as they have rarely found a way into print. Now I propose to take these parallels more seriously, so that we may at least have them clearly in mind in the recon- struction of tribal histories. Ritual objects.-The term fetich-bundle applies to the tiponi of the Hopi, the mi'le of Zufii, the iyetiko (iariko2) of the Keres. All these consist of a hollowed ear of corn filled with various seeds and girt with feathers, cotton, beads, and arrowpoints. It is the Mother and is the most sacred of altar properties. Its possession is a warrant for chieftaincy among the Hopi where it descends in the maternal family in charge of the ceremony. At Zufii, curiously enough, the corresponding ceremonial groups, the rain priest- hoods, where office also descends in the maternal family, have no corn fetiches, only the curing societies are possessed of them. The Zufi curing societies show Keresan influence, and wherever the Keresan medicine society has spread, as at Isleta and among the Tewa, we may expect to find the Corn Mothers, even when the record is scant or missing. The Mothers may be renewed at the 1 Read at the meeting of the American Anthropological Association, Dec. 28, 1928. 2 Honani (Acoma). 642</page><page sequence="2">PARSONS] PUEBLO AND PLAINS CULTURES 643 ceremonies when they are to be brought out, but there is no dis- tinctive renewal ritual as that for the Plains bundles. Offerings are made to the Mothers, but in the form of sprinkling corn meal upon them (as well as upon other sacrosanct objects) so that the appearance of the sacrifice is different from that of the Plains. As part of the bundle complex we may consider other sacro- sanct objects which are unwrapped and set out on Pueblo altars- the bird skins on the Hopi altar, and the sticks representing de- ceased society members, and on Hopi and other altars stones of curious formation and arrowpoints and blades all of which might have come out of any Plains bundle. The stones and points tend to be individual property in the nature of amulet. Probably every Pueblo ceremonialist has his own little bundle or bag of sacro- sanct things which he contributes to the altar with which he is associated. The befeathered cylinder worn on the head of the warrior (Hopi-Zufii) is in the nature of a bundle, for it contains objects taken from the enemy or other medicine. Comparable are the anthropomorphic fetiches of the Pueblo Clown societies, perhaps the image of the Hopi Sand Altar Virgin, with the images used in the Sun dance. I do not include here the images or dolls of the kachina cult, as I impute them, together with the elaborately carved altar pieces, to Spanish influence. The friars took pains to teach the art of carving.3 Sacrosanct sticks are used by the Clown societies as sticks of office-the chief of the Ne'wekwe of Zufii has such a baton; the Kurena of the Keres carry a rattle-stick, a crook with olivella shells, as does the Mother of the kachina (Hopi). The crook stick is used by the kachina dance announcer at Zufii.4 Of a different type is the "chief's stick" carried by a few chiefly kachina among the Hopi and by members of the tribal societies. These sticks are flat with feather or skin pendant from each end, very similar to sticks fashioned by war societies of the Plains. The canes of office of the Pueblo (Zufii) war chiefs are in form Spanish but this use of pseudo-fetichistic sticks may be pre-Spanish. 8 See The Memorial of Fray Alonso de Benavides, 33, 1630.

S., 31, 1929 Certain types of Pueblo prayer-sticks, I venture to say, have been influenced by the feathered lances, straight and crooked, of the Plains. I have in mind the crook stick with the cotton string drawn from the tip of the crook to the straight part of the stick (used by the Pekwin of Zufii, by all the Jemez societies, by the Hopi youth at his first Winter Solstice ceremony), also the common Hopi type called hotomni where the pendant feathers are fastened equidistant down the length of the stick. The concept of prayer-stick as miniature weapon occurs, we know, among the Pueblos, in the miniature bow and arrow and war club. Headdress, mask, and sacred paint.-The Buffalo headdress of the Plains Buffalo dance is in use in all the pueblos, and pre- sumably the Buffalo headdress passed into the composition of the kachina mask of the horned type at Zufii and elsewhere. Antlered headdresses are worn also in dances by both Plains and Pueblo tribes. Two of the Hopi tribal societies, Horns and Agaves, wear elaborate antlered headdress. In some of the Plains societies an- imal masks are in use as well as headdress, by the society chiefs, a restricted use which suggests that of the mask in the Keresan- Zuni curing society which is worn only at initiations or in grave cases of curing. Besides the animal masks among the Plains there are clown masks. These clown or burlesque masks are in vogue among the western pueblos, where they are in the keeping of the Clown societies (Ne'wekwe at Zuii,5 Wdwbchimtu on First Mesa). These masks, both Plains and Pueblo, seem to me to be of a European type, but into that question of provenience I may not go at present nor into the question of the degree in which the Spanish mask may have influenced masks of the kachina type." More pronounced than masking in the clown groups, apart from the Koyemshi, is facial pigmentation. (Note the black and white painting of the Kossa, Koshare, and Ne'wekwe, and the stripes on the face of Bitsitsi and of the Hopi Singers.) Face and body pigmentation has a sacrosanct character among the Pueblos 6 Note their use, too, by the lewekwe or stick-swallowing society (M. C. Stevenson, The Zufii Indians, 23rd Ann. Rept. Bur. Am. Ethn., 471,477, 1901-2). 6 See Spanish Elements in the Kachina Cult of the Pueblos. Proceedings of the 23rd International Congress of Americanists, 1928 (in proof).</page><page sequence="4">PARSONS] PUEBLO AND PLAINS CULTURES 645 as it may have among the Plains, e. g., on ceremonial shield or tipi or in the painting of initiates in the Sun dance. Before the kachina mask is put on, a black stripe is painted over the bridge of the nose and under the eyes of the impersonator, and until the body paint is washed off an impersonator, he remains taboo or sacred, teshkwi in Zufii term. Ritual: Where convenient, the kachina impersonator bathes in the river. Ritual bath or headwash is a very frequent perfor- mance among the Pueblos, where the sweat bath of the Plains and of the Navaho, did not take.' But the object of both river and sweat bath is ritual purification. Head-washing, to be sure, which in the western pueblos accompanies all forms of naming and initia- tion, is without any at least explicit purifying meaning, and may be ascribed in part, no doubt, to the Friars, who gave such great weight to the rite of baptism. The rite of incensing among the Pueblos seems to be also one of mixed sources, Spanish as well as Indian. Puffing smoke on sac- rosanct objects such as masks.and altar fetiches looks European, whereas fumigating a patient or the property of a deceased person looks Indian. Probably the two practices should be considered as quite distinctive rites. The Plains practice of offering the pipe to a spirit or as a form of initiation to a man is again a distinctive rite, the Pueblo equivalent of which is sending a cigarette to a kachina group to invite them to dance or asking for anything ceremonial with tobacco or including a cigarette partly smoked, with other prayer offerings. In this connection, the ritual use of sage and of cedar by both Plains and Pueblos may be noted, for ritual smudge (Plains and Pueblo), for emetic (cedar, Pueblo), for medicine, for prayer-stick offering (sage, Pueblo, particularly Hopi). Prayer-stick or feathers is outstanding in Pueblo ritual, and even more ubiquitous than the offering of feathers is that of meal. The lack of these sacrificial types among the Plains gives a dif- ferent cast to their ritual of sacrifice. However food offerings other than meal are made by the Pueblos, deposited in the open or, on 7 There is a reference to its former use at Isleta.</page><page sequence="5">646 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST IN. S., 31, 1929 eating, crumbled indoors, bits are dropped on the ground, just as the Kiowa, for example, at meal time would hold up a bit of their meat to the Sun and then bury it. The Pueblo rite of fasting from food or drink while engaged in ceremonial enterprise is somewhat comparable with that of the Plains rite, more particularly in connection with the Sun dance. The Plains variety of fasting to get supernatural experience is not found among the Pueblos, although now and again one gets hints in the folk-tales that ritual abstinence is to provoke the compassion of the spirits quite as among the Plains.8 What has been called by Plains students the iruska complex of rites-enduring boiling water, fire-handling, stick-swallowing, jugglery at large-is to be found in various fragments among the Pueblos. Stirring boiling water without being burned oc- curs as a rite in the initiation into the Winter chieftaincy of the Tewa. (It occurs well integrated or rationalized-can heat hurt Winter or Ice "men?).9 Fire play is ritual of several societies at Zuiixo and of the Keresan Fire society, with which societies stick-swallowing is also associated. Reviving the dead, which is a Plains shaman trick or tradition, also figures in Pueblo tradi- tion. The ability to go great distances, by flying or otherwise, and to see from a distance is imputed to Keresan and Isletan" as well as to Plains shamans. Among the Pueblos, however, these powers do not come distinctively through the spirits, more particularly through supernatural animals, although the power of flight was 8 The theme, by the way, of the neglected or persecuted little boy "who knows something," i.e., has supernatural power, occurs quite commonly in Pueblo tales. Study of the distribution of this theme from the southwest to the northwest through Siberia to Jerusalem and into Europe and back into the Southwest were of interest. * Compare, too, the Pueblo tale of the youth who puts on the coat of ice to endure the test of fire. 10 At initiation ceremonial of the Uhuhukwe of Zufii, Hehea kachina are chased with firebrands (The Zufii Indians, 526), in a way reminiscent of the Fire dance of the Navaho. Hehea (Keresan, Heluta) is Tonenili of the Navaho. He has traits in common with Coyote (Stephen was told that the Navaho Fire dance was a dramatiza- tion of the Plains-Pueblo myth of fire-stealing by Coyote). Is there a possible etymolo- gical connection between heluta and iruska? 11 These are outstanding attributes of the Fathers at Isleta. In this connection note the flights of the nun, Maria de Jesus, to the Pueblos. Benavides, 59, 276.</page><page sequence="6">PARSONs] PUEBLO AND PLAINS CULTURES 647 described to Father Dumarest as due to Eagle.12 The powers to hunt and to cure, however, derive very generally among the Pueblos from Mountain Lion and from Bear. In the tales the individual in distress gets help from Spider-woman who gives "medicines," which may be compared in a way with the help from guardian spirits among the Plains. Among the Hopi there are shrines to Spider-woman, but they are not visited by the indi- vidual on his own account. Individual supernatural experience is not sought by the Pueblos. As Dr. Bunzel has been pointing out, individualistic experience of no kind is sought by them. The differentiation here between Pueblos and Plains may be well seen in the seeking of omens by the Pueblos as against the Plains seek- ing of visions or of supernatural helpers.13 The Zufii war chief was expected to go at night to the River and listen for sounds, pro- pitious and unpropitious. The celebrant of the Hopi Water serpent ceremony has also to listen at the spring for sounds, the Ante- lopes14 spend a night at the spring for good visions, and in some instances the depositor of prayer-sticks is told to withdraw after placing his sticks and later return to observe their position. Such omens are for the use of the groups at large, not for the individual seeker. Consequently the ritual messenger reports them to his society There is no such secretiveness about individualistic super- natural experience as is seen among the Plains. But not all super- natural experience is individualistic among the Plains. There is shamanistic organization, particularly with animal mentors or patrons, and this type is a character, too, of the early iruska complex, parallel parts of which we noted among the Pueblos. Along lines of ceremonial organization, however, it is in the organization for war that Pueblo-Plains parallels are to be looked for. Now the matter of the Pueblo organization for war is exces- sively problematic, it is obsolete and besides it has been peculiarly 12 Notes on Cochiti, New Mexico. Mem. Am. Anthr. Assoc., 6: 212, 1919. 1s Elements of the vision =guardian spirit complex are present among the Pueblos, as Dr. Benedict writes (The Concept of the Guardian Spirit in North America, Mem. Am. Anthr. Assoc., 29: 40, 1923), even if the guardian spirit itself is lacking. 14 See below.</page><page sequence="7">648 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 31, 1929 subject to Spanish influence. Early in the eighteenth century there was imposed upon the Pueblos by royal edict a secular governmental organization of governor and lieutenant and sheriffs or captains. These groups became the executives or mouthpieces for the ceremonialists who remained the real sources of authority. However, these Hispanicised groups of officers took over, I surmise, some of the functions of the old war or police groups, at least whenever these became extinct. To what extent the present Outside chiefs or war captains of the Keres and Tewa are Pueblo or Spanish, defies analysis. They are appointed as secular officers with the governor and his lieutenants, but they safeguard the ceremonies against intruders including witches, they maintain ceremonial conformity, and they make systematic prayer-stick offerings. The bow priesthood at Zufii and the kalektaka group of the Hopi appear to represent the earlier pre- Spanish type of organization. At Taos and Isleta a third policing type is seen in the chiefs or little chiefs, younger men who are attached to the governor, possibly as a modernized or Hispanic form of the Plains police or akichita societies. Of these police or military societies, more archaic parallels are to be seen in some of the Hopi societies-more particularly in the tribal societies, Tataukyamu (Singers)15 and Wdwdchimtu (Old men),xe Agaves, and Horns. These are the four societies into one of which every youth is initiated. All four have particular paints and headdresses. There is a rule against going in front of the W6wichimtu, on pain of twisting sickness, which would have to be treated by the society chief, and the woman member of the associated woman's society, the Mamzrau, would have her mouth twisted, if she absented herself from the ceremonials.17 The functions of the Agaves and Horns are those of scout and guard; they do not dance. The Singers and Wiwochimtu have '" So translated by Voth. Stephen sees a possible etymology from a term meaning to carry on the back, as are the novices. 1e This, too, is an approximate, but more certain, etymology. In the Plains societies which are not graded by age, there is a tendency for the older men to go into one society (Lowie, Anthrop. Pap. Mus. Nat. Hist., 11: 904). This may once have occurred among the Hopi. 17 Stephen's Journal in Ms.</page><page sequence="8">PARSONS] PUEBLO AND PLAINS CULTURES 649 dance steps and songs, of which some are of a phallic or obscene character, as is their clownish behavior. There are no women in these four societies, but the women societies are associated with the men's, conceptually and in actual behavior. Then there are the Snake and Antelope societies. The Snakes were warriors, according to Hopi tradition. When they went on the war trail, they carried battle axe and club, not spear or bow and arrow. They knew no fear and marched up to the enemy and seized him by the throat, like a snake, and knocked him on the head with axe or club.18 The Antelopes were old men who remained in the kiva singing and praying while the Snakes were fighting. In Snake-Antelope ceremonial many details corroborate this tradition of sometime military character. The out-and-out clown groups of First Mesa of which two out of the three are known to be borrowed from Zuifi and the Tewa; the Zufii clowns-Ne'wekwe (and their affiliated society, the Shi'wanakwe) and Koyemshi; the moiety clown groups of Isleta-Black Eyes and Red Eyes or Gophers; the Koshare and Kurena of the Keres, the Kossa of the Tewa; the Tabdsh and Tsunta tab6sh of Jemez; the Black Eyes of Taos and Picuris- all these have various traits of the Plains military societies: in- verted speech or talking backwards, foolhardiness19 (more par- ticularly in eating), stalking a stray creature, dog or chicken (instead of buffalo), showing mock fear, initiating by trespass, and inspiring fear. Their Plains-like fetiches, sacrosanct sticks, and pigmentation we have already mentioned. The representa- tive of the supernatural patron of the Ne'wekwe carries a whistle as well as a baton and in his ceremony walks with arms crossed on his chest, an eagle feather in each hand. His face is striped in white. Wrapped in his blanket, he strides through the on-lookers at the Molawia ceremony the very picture of a Plains high chief. Bitsitsi is a representative of Paiyetemu (Youth, in Keresan), the Sun youth. (A Ne'wekwe sometimes comes out to play with Is Stephen's Journal in Ms '9 Cf. Lowie, 960-1.</page><page sequence="9">650 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 31, 1929 the sun painted on his back.)20 As a kachina the Sun is also re- presented. By both Pueblos and Plains the Sun is greatly regarded. In Tewa-Zufii tale the Sun appears as a handsome man to his sons, the war gods, or to the neglected little boy, giving them a desirable outfit and, in the latter case, an admirable name, a vision of which the conceptualism seems strikingly Plains-like. In Pueblo tale the Sun's sons, the war gods, are associated, more or less obscurely, with the Morning Star, and the Pleiades and Orion have a distinct war association among the Hopi. These constellations are observed very generally by the Pueblos, and counted among the supernaturals. Lightning is a Pueblo super- natural, although at times Lightning like the Rainbow seems to be rather an attribute of the Rain or Storm spirits than a separate entity. Wind is a malevolent spirit throughout the Pueblos, and particularised among the Hopi and Tewa as a mean old woman. Mountain ogres or cannibalistic giants figure among both Pueblos and Plains. Distinctively Pueblo are the Rain or Cloud spirits with their varying association with the Dead and with the chiefs of the Directions, and the Mothers of the Underworld, the Corn mothers. At first sight the character of Plains religion seems far more pantheistic than that of Pueblo religion. But when we con- sider such collective pantheistic terms as Kopishtaiya (Keres) and Kay6 (Tewa) and when we realize how almost any creature, human or animal, as well as the anthropomorphically cosmic, can find a place among the kachina, the impression of this differ- entiation loses weight. The Spirits, the behavior of ceremonial groups, rites and ritual objects--in these particulars we have been finding our parallels, without note of the ceremonial organization at large or the cere- monial calendar. Along these lines there is little to compare, in the first case because ceremonial organization as a whole is natur- ally closely bound up with the general social organization which between Pueblo and Plains tribes differs considerably,-maternal clan, paternal moiety, and town chieftaincies giving a character to the Pueblos which is generally lacking in the Plains,-in the second case because the calendar of an agricultural people con- 20 Winter and Summer Dance Series in Zufii, 194.</page><page sequence="10">PARSONS] PUEBLO AND PLAINS CULTURES 651 cerned primarily with season, weather, and crops naturally varies from calendars determined by hunters and warriors. With an outstandingly agricultural tribe in the Plains area, the Pawnee, parallels in calendar and organization appear, so strikingly indeed that I should like to conclude our discussion with a special comparison of Pueblo and Pawnee ceremonialism. As at Zufii, there is a marked distinction among the Pawnee between the medicine or curing societies and the societies pos- sessed of a rain bundle which is referred to as "rain-storm wrapped up" and consists of two decorated ears of corn,21 known, in Pueblo fashion, as the mother of the people. These are white ears with glumes or tasseled tips, perfectly kernelled,22 with the first section of the stem left on.23 In each bundle society there are four leaders or chiefs whose position is hereditary; presumably through the maternal line they are the descendants of the first keepers of the bundle.24 The chiefs of the society choose the members, within limitations, from kindred of the deceased members, a method of selection not unknown to the Hopi and the people of Jemez. The chief of the society is the keeper of the ritual and the bundle, although actually the keeper is the wife, often the sister, of the chief, again a marked Hopi and Zuii feature. There is a Pueblo-like hierarchic council, consisting of the chiefs of the four main bundles, and these chiefs rotate in the office of supreme chief, each chief holding office for a half year,25 reminding us of the terms of office of the Winter Man and the Sum- mer Man of the Tewa. Each of the four paramount Pawnee chiefs selects a warrior who in turn selects three police, men with clubs. These positions of warrior and police are life long. Again 21 G. A.

Assoc., No. 36 (in press).</page><page sequence="11">652 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 31, 1929 we are reminded of certain relations between the secular and cere- monial officers of the Pueblos. The crier for the Pawnee priest26 recalls the Zufii and Hopi crier. The Pawnee medicine-men derive their powers from living creatures, and in their processions the medicine-men costume themselves to represent their animal mentors27-Pueblo traits. There are two Pawnee medicine lodges, West and East. In each bundle society there are north and south moieties, the north side leading in winter ceremonies, the south side, in summer,28 a seasonal division bringing to mind that of the Tewa and of Taos. The Pawnee bundle rituals form an annual series, beginning with the planting and ending with the harvest, i.e., there is a ceremonial calendar which may be compared, if only loosely, with the Pueblo calendar, although the outstanding Pawnee ceremony is typically Plains, for it occurs at the first thunder in the spring when the lance paraphernalia are renewed. Possibly the early spring pre-planting ceremonies of field cleansing or exor- cism by the Pueblo war or clown societies are corresponding per- formances. Phallic or fertility practices attach to both Pueblo and Pawnee 29 war groups. Specifically the spring to autumn bundle rituals may be compared with the summer rain retreats of Zufii or Jemez. Pueblo-like offerings of eagle feathers and of beads are made by the Pawnee and offerings may be thrown into water, into the river, or into a certain pool in a crater cone;30 and there are several references to what I take to be prayer-sticks3' or prayer-feathers,32 26 G.

In the seventeenth century the Pawnee raided for horses into the Pueblo area, but long before that, prior to their northeasterly migrations, may they not have been in closer and more pacific contact with the Pueblos? At any rate when the cultivation of maize was acquired by the Pawnee it carried ideology and ritualism similar to the Pueblo. Here, possibly, in a maize complex of ritual together with technique, the Southwest imparted its culture on a more notable scale than Kroeber has allowed for in his last masterly contribution to the discussion of the distribution of cultural traits in North America.57 HARRISON, NEW YORK 50 Sun and Moon are of minor importance, the star cult is preeminent.
