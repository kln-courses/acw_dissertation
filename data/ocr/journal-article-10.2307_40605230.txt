For example, late-nineteenth- century portraits by artists such as Mary Cassatt (1844-1926) are seen to inade- quately represent femininity when meas- ured against the alluring and seductive portraits by Ingres from half a century earlier. While Garb details changing rep- resentational strategies in relation to por- traiture, she does not adequately acknowledge how understandings of femininity shifted throughout the centu- ry, and, thus, I believe she misses an opportunity to consider the development of modern female portraiture in France through the lens of revisionist scholarship on gender. Garb divides her discussion of female portraiture in The Painted Face into six chapters, arranged chronologically, each of which takes as its frame of reference a portrait by a canonical artist: Ingres, Manet, Cassatt, Cézanne, Picasso, and Matisse. She employs a vast array of materials and sources in her wide-rang- ing discussion, including exhibition reviews, journals, letters, and advertise- ments. Her methodology is equally var- ied depending on the image(s) under dis- cussion and the requirements of her argu- ment: psychoanalysis, feminism, social art history, semiotics, and formalism. Garb states in the acknowledgements that she chose the six paintings with no con- sideration in mind other than her own tastes, rather than conforming to "politi- cal, intellectual or historical criteria or pre-conceived notions of coverage" (ix), and it is this statement that sets up some of the problems for the text. Though asserting that she is not writing a history of female portraiture - and, indeed, six random and highly selective portraits do not make a history - Garb does attempt, in the introduction, to position paintings of women within the framework of the metaphorical relationship between make- up and oil paint that existed in Europe since the seventeenth century. She claims that as early as the eighteenth century the artificiality and seductiveness of makeup and oil paint are especially significant in regard to female portraiture. By the nine- teenth century, she claims, "the scene of make-up became a crucial site for a painterly meditation on the nature of the medium" (8-9), and "the link between personal adornment and painterly effect was regarded as a worthy subject for art and Woman was, by now, its widely accepted avatar" (9). Further she posits that this "seamless fit between medium and matter" collapsed at the beginning of the twentieth century with artists such as Matisse and Picasso (9). Garb lays out her thesis concerning these ties between makeup, paint, and femininity with care- fully chosen images that underscore her argument very explicitly, particularly in the case of representations of women at their toilette. Notably, however, though the book's title suggests a focus on por- traiture, most of the paintings she dis- cusses in the introduction are not por- traits, and her attempts to connect make- up, paint, and femininity are less effective SPRING / SUMMER 2009 @</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1.

Chapter 1, "Fictions of Femininity in the Case of Ingres's Portrait of Madame de Senonnes/' begins with a discussion of Edgar Allan Poe's short story 'The Oval Portrait/' which literalizes the link between paint and femininity /female body. In the story, a deranged artist becomes so absorbed in making a lifelike portrait of his wife that he does not notice her death. The gruesome result of his having depicted her through the media of her blood and decaying skin is a disturbingly lifelike representation. Ingres's own paint application has also been seen as having lifelike qualities - so much so that viewers of the painting have been guilty of "slippage between actual woman and portrait image" (34) - suggestive of the connection between paint, makeup, and femininity that Garb underscores in her introduction. She discusses how Ingres's painting (made between 1813 and 1815 but little known until 1853) has been admired for its seductive address (again paint and woman are conflated here) and was also the subject of much theorizing regarding the sitter's identity and nationality. Garb concludes that (male) artists, in fusing paint and Woman, idealizing their artificiality, and underscoring their seductive qualities, have done little more than serve "fantasies of successive viewing communities as a narrative spur" (57). This chapter is arguably the most important and successful. Ingres's portrait of Mme de Senonnes (and more specifically Ingres's representation of an alluring femininity) becomes the linchpin of Garb's argument, the portrait against which the others are, at least tacitly, measured. Again, however, Garb's notion that in such portraits makeup was "a crucial site for painterly meditations on the nature of medium" is not supported going forward. In the second chapter, "Framing Femininity in Manet's Portrait of Mile E.G," Garb focuses on the portrait of Eva Gonzalez exhibited at the Salon of 1870, calling it the "antithesis ... of an 'Ingresque' homage to a beautiful sitter" (59) and a focal point for derision by salon-goers. This canvas, produced by the artist who painted Olympia, failed to meet the standards for society portraiture in its lack of idealization (Garb contrasts it in this respect to Carolus-Duran's 1870 portrait of Mme Ernest Feydeau) and its improper depiction of the sitter's upper arms. As a portrait of a female artist at work, it was seen as equally unsuccessful because the sitter's clothing and posture were unconvincing for that role. Thus, Manet's portrait of Gonzalez is discussed in the context of its failure to adequately /readably capture femininity in ways that could be understood by contemporaries. In the end, Garb argues that the portrait of Gonzales can be more believably read as a "portrait" of Manet, given the several elements in the painting that reference him: his characteristic brushstrokes, the depicted items that could have been found in his studio, and the easel that showcases one of his typical subjects. There is no discussion in the chapter of the relation between paint/makeup/femininity, seamless or otherwise. In the third chapter, "Blank Mourning, Portraiture and Separation," Garb looks at Cassatt's image(s) of her mother, particularly Mrs. R. S. Cassati, (e. 1889; Fig. 1) and, to a lesser extent, Reading 'he Figaro' (1878). Here Garb relies on psychoanalysis to explore Cassatt's evolving relationship with her mother and the influence on both women of the death of Cassatt's sister, Lydia. The lack of finish in Mrs. R.S. Cassatt is read as evidence of Cassatt's identification with her mother's depression over her daughter's death and her own aging, so that Cassatt "can neither resolve her feelings nor finish her work" (137). The topic of makeup is again largely absent from this chapter, except where it is cursorily mentioned in connection to Manet's Woman Reading (1878-79). As with the portrait of Gonzales in the previous chapter, Garb makes a point of noting that the depiction of Cassatt's mother "makes no concessions to the aesthetics of seduction that was typical of female portraiture of the period" (128). Lacking here, however, are any examples of "typical" female portraits of the period with which to contrast the painting. "Touching Sexual Difference: Madame Cézanne in a Red Dress," the fourth chap- ter, contains Garb's discussion of Cezanne's many images of his wife, Hortense Fiquet, in which the artist explores the "portrait as pure presence" (139). The reader is apprised that such a project does not require "traditional demands for superficial likeness, psycho- logical insight or seductive address" (139) (so we are forewarned that there will again be scant discussion of makeup). Garb instead attributes a great deal of sig- nificance to Fiquet's hands in Red Dress (1893-95). Their position in her lap, along with her posture, are crucial to Garb's psychoanalytic reading, as they are seen to register Cezanne's anxiety by furnish- ing her an "erect posture and miniature penis as if to stave off the fear that her cas- tration (and difference) provoked" (177). Her hands also become a vehicle for Garb's in-depth discussion of Cezanne's painting practice, particularly his efforts to break down subject /object distinctions, which he once attempted to describe in a conversation with Joachim Gasquet through the use of hand gestures (142-44). Garb does spend quite a bit of time on Cezanne's paint application in rela- tion to femininity and sexuality (without mention of makeup). She argues that in the nineteenth century paint "infused #Ä WOMAN'S ART JOURNAL</page><page sequence="3">the surface of the picture itself with the erotic power of female flesh. Never had touch, sexuality and painting been so intimately intertwined" (145). As a por- trait, however, she suggests that "Cezanne's image of his wife seduces (if it seduces at all) by other means than those conventionally assigned to female portraiture" (157-58). Thus, again, the femininity of Hortense Fiquet (like that of Gonzalez and Cassati' s mother) is not "securely established" and the painting is "devoid of the artifice and adornment culturally associated with the feminine and repeatedly enshrined in portrait practice" (167-69). On the topic of make- up, she says that Fiquet's "painted face refuses its traditional association with boudoir Beauty and revels in the dis- junction between paint and flesh that so much nineteenth-century female por- traiture had sought to occlude" (169). At this point in her narrative, however, Garb's only example of this supposed widespread occlusion remains Ingres' s portrait of Mme de Senonnes, under- scoring her assumption of a femininity that is valid across the entire century. Garb does not acknowledge that Cezanne's image could be seen as some- thing more than an exception to a rule, but as actively constructive of feminini- ty. This would have made a far more compelling argument. In Chapter 5, "The Portrait in Pieces: Cubism's Corpse," Garb discusses Picasso's Ma Jolie (1912-14) and, to a less- er extent, Female Nude: J'aime Eva (1912). Here her attention turns to how the tradi- tional eroticism of female portraiture - as posited by herself - is displaced from the female body to language. The words found on the painted surfaces of these images compensate, she claims, for the "dispersal of decathected body parts . . . Language here, instead of marking the death knell of figuration, functions to compensate for loss by offering a sonic invocation of the loved one" (209). Further, she says, "Language substitutes for the tangibility of the integral figure, traditional repository of fantasy, and injects a libidinal energy into the scene of representation itself" (188). So, while tra- ditional "female portraiture was meant to animate the sitter and placate the viewer" (208), images such as Female Nude "test the limits of individual inscription and abstracted generality while placing lan- guage at the erotic core of representation" (184). As with the other images she dis- cusses, these offer "no overt sensual grat- ification of the type that audiences had come to expect from painted portrayals of the beloved" (181). In fact, as she points out, they are hardly portraits in any con- ventional sense, and her discussion in this chapter focuses more on the abandon- ment of realism and mimeticism by Cubist artists generally rather than on portraits of women qua women. Her statement that "portraiture would never be the same" after Picasso and Cubism had deconstructed it and that both por- traiture and the "rigid gender roles" of the nineteenth century (which are never defined) became permeable rather than fixed (201) is problematic, given that none of the images in the previous three chap- ters, according to her argument, con- formed to conventional understandings of femininity either. In her final chapter, "The Lost Subject of Portraiture: Matisse's Portrait of 1913," Garb discusses the ways in which this work questions portraiture as a genre. The lack of a named sitter (in this case, the artist's wife) suggests a portrait of a genre rather than of a person. Garb spends much time reviewing the varied reactions to the painting when it was exhibited at the 1913 Salon d' Automne, when the "discourse of the lover was still the dom- inant mode through which female por- traiture was absorbed" (231). She ties the canvas back to Mona Lisa, which was stolen from the Louvre around this time. These two events - the theft and the exhi- bition of Matisse's painting - are read as symbols of the "ultimate irreco verability" of portraiture /femininity (246). Matisse's painting is not "alluring" in any tradition- al sense; its "voluptuousness" is "pictori- al rather than carnal" (230). The canvas, writes Garb, is a "consummate rejection both of the mimetic task of portraiture and its conventional image of a seductive femininity" (211). The topic of makeup resurfaces in this chapter as Garb describes the mask- like face of Matisse's sitter: The mobilization of the mask as a substitute for the face ... does not so much suggest the made-up face of the Parisienne, with her rouged lips and powdered cheeks - both well-trodden pictorial tropes in which the exotic and the erotic are inscribed on the surface as artifice - but rather it invokes an evacuated subjectivity, drained of vitality and strength (242). The connection between paint, makeup, and femininity is more forceful in her brief discussion of Matisse's The Red Madras Headdress (1907): Made up in paint ... the eyes are drawn in kohl, the lower lashes blackened with mascara, the red lips brushed into the face, the cheeks smeared with rouge.... Veiled rather than revealing, a mask of maquillage seems to conceal the model's face and inscribe her identity as "skin- deep": conceived as a surface saturated with sexuality but devoid of specificity or profundity ... [the face] seemed to proffer a subject in disguise, clad in an exotic Indian headscarf and covered in garish make-up, a "painted woman," artificially put together like the practice of painting itself (241-42). Given that Garb begins and ends the book by highlighting this connection, one suspects that this is the argument she wanted to make all along, but that there was a disconnect between the images and portraits she chose based on preference, and the history she wanted to write about makeup, paint, and female portraiture. If she had adhered to her original intention, as stated in her acknowledgements, not to write a history of female portraiture and to let each essay stand on its own, her arguments would have been more successful. In addition to Garb's focus on paintings that undermine the argument laid out in the introduction and her insistence on a monolithic femininity, Garb's problems in addressing gender continue with her strict and conventional distinctions between masculinity and femininity and how these are manifest in SPRING / SUMMER 2009 A</page><page sequence="4">visual culture. She states, for example, that the frontal address of women in portraiture "produced a mirror-like surface for the staging of a female subject whose decorative veneer provided an analogue for the seductive attractions of painting itself, while her body was imagined as an interlocutor or addressee for the admiring spectator" (12). Perhaps. But considering that portraits of men also are oriented to face the viewer, would Garb say similar things about the seductiveness and spectacle of men represented in portraits? I suspect not. Also vexing with regard to questions of gender are Garb's continued assumptions about interiors and their accoutrements - wallpaper and chairs, particularly of the floral variety - as somehow uniquely or specifically feminine. In chapter three for example, she writes, Mme Pontillon's concealing cos- tume contrasts with the exaggerat- ed padding and anthropomorphic bulges of the colourful couch, which seems to serve as a displaced arena for the exploration of the crevices and folds characteristic of the female sexual organs. Where repro- ductive sexuality is hidden on the body, it is teased out on the sofa (112). How then would Garb theorize the numerous contemporaneous images of men sitting on cushioned sofas or padded chairs? Though there is no acknowledgement of it, the stale notions about the rigid distinction between public/private and male/female on which Garb persistently relies have been increasingly interrogated by scholars.2 small volume published in conjunction with an exhibition at the Spencer Museum of Art, The University of Kansas, as part of the University's Franklin D. Murphy Lecture Series, The Body in Time contains only two chapters. The first focuses on Degas' s images of ballet dancers, while the second, like The Painted Face, deals with portraiture. The second chapter begins with Ingres, and, as in The Painted Face, his portraits of women are set up as the epit- ome of seductive femininity, providing "sensual delight and surface pleasure ... a screen onto which the passions of succes- sive viewers could accumulate and res- onate" (44). This is more or less the same argument given about Ingres in the earli- er volume, but here Garb reveals its source in an essay published in 1899 by the critic Camille Mauclair, entitled "La femme devant les peintres modernes." Mauclair, she writes, "delivered an account of the historical gendering of portraiture and the profoundly distinct conventions of representation and modes of viewing that portraits of men and women had traditionally required" (44). In both texts, then, she uses the Mauclair framework - highly select and conserva- tive - within which to position female portraits (and the women pictured?) as little more than ciphers for male sexual desire. In The Body in Time, however, Garb does a better job of acknowledging the problematics of Mauclair's essay. Here, for example, in discussing Manet's Portrait of Eva Gonzales, Garb notes that emergent definitions of femininity clashed with Mauclair's traditionalism (54) - a more nuanced reading than that given in The Painted Face, where this por- trait is presented as a failed representa- tion of conventional femininity. Also not discussed in The Painted Face, which relies heavily on Mauclair's argument that female portraits provided little more than tabulae rasae for male desire, is Mauclair's distinction between such traditional ways of viewing female portraits and the changes in the genre brought about by the fact that women were becoming more "interested in asserting an identity of their own" (56). Garb praises Mauclair for being "one of the first critics to try to describe what was a real shift in representational codes and to ascribe this change to the appearance of an emergent social type, the 'femme nouvelle'" (59). She refers to his "construction of Woman as a blank slate onto which men would inscribe their desires," as "phantasmatic" and a "product of fin de siècle gender ideology" (59). Again, this questioning of Mauclair is absent from The Painted Face, where it is sorely needed. Indeed, he is hardly mentioned there at all. On the differing representations of the New Woman at the end of the century, Garb notes that they were subject to caricature and were "figures of fun" (65), an attitude that extended to female artists in the profession. Thus, she writes that portraits of women and self-portraits by Anna Bilinska- Bohdanowiczowa, Anna Elizabeth Klumpke, Ellen Day Hale, and Marie Bashkirtseff often "defy conventional notions of female prettiness or the demands of idealization to which society portraits adhere" (72), again suggesting some pre-existing and stable femininity against which these artists and portraits are working. Taken together, the two books offer insights into the practice of portraiture in the nineteenth century, particularly in relation to the dramatically changing representational strategies from Rococo to Cubism. The Painted Face is beautifully produced and illustrated throughout, with 70 color images and twice as many black and whites. The text, however, is marred by Garb's assumption that her chosen portraits do not adequately represent femininity, implying a (never clearly defined) static femininity rather than interrogating these works as actively constitutive of femininity. Garb's efforts to tell this story within the overlapping and constricting frameworks of Mauclair and makeup/paint/femininity further hinder her efforts. • Temma Balducci is an Assistant Professor of Art History at Arkansas State University.
