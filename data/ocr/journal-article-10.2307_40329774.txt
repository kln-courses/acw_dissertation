<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT By K. A. McElhanon* ~ , Background General ~ , HpHE Kabwum Sub-district comprises the mountainous country inhabited by -*■ the non-Austronesian-speaking Timbe, Selepet and Komba linguistic groups and the coastal area inhabited by various small Austronesian-speaking peoples, the best known of which are the Sio people.1 The mountain dwellers are geographically isolated from the other mountain peoples of the Huon Peninsula by the heavily- forested Saruwaged and Cromwell mountain ranges which vary between 10,000 and 13,500 feet altitude.2 The 10,000 Timbe people in the west are the most isolated of the four groups. A sharp dividing ridge extending northerly from Mt. Saruwaged separates the Timbe people from the Selepet and Komba peoples. The 9,000 Komba people inhabit the Kwama River basin and sandwiched between these two larger groups are the 5,500 Selepet people, the bulk of which inhabit the Pumune River valley.8 A lesser number of Selepets live on the windward slopes of the dividing ridge overlooking the coastal littoral inhabited by the Austronesian groups. The Timbe and Kwama basins are very rugged with a number of steep gorges cutting through the rough hills. The main vegetation is kunai grass (Imperata) and wild sugar cane (Saccharum spontaneum) although scattered forest areas do occur along the backs of the ridges. Dialect boundaries (four in Timbe, four in Komba and two in Selepet) roughly coincide with the natural boundaries formed by the gorges. The mountain population is relatively dense : 51 per square mile as compared to a national average of 12 per square mile. There are nearly a hundred villages with an average population of 300. The largest village is Indum (Selepet) with 1,341. In days of pre-European contact the society was organised according to patrilineal settlements around a men's club house. There were no villages and the people were scattered throughout the countryside in these hamlet-sized settlements. Occasionally a number of these settlements would join together in defensive alliances. In order to facilitate administration, the Europeans encouraged the people to build ♦Summer Institute of Linguistics. 1This paper is based upon field work carried out during 1964-67. For a description of Selepet social organisation and kinship see McElhanon (1968). Harding (1967&amp;) describes the trading system of the Vitiaz Strait and the Sio hinterland as well as presenting a sketch of Sio society. 2 The three mountain groups constitute the Western Family of languages, one of five families of languages constituting the Huon Micro-phylum (see McElhanon, 1967). 8 Population figures are those of the linguistic groups, not the census divisions as reported by Harding (1967a). The figures are taken from 1966 census reports on hand at Kabwum Sub- district onice.</page><page sequence="2">CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT 175 central villages. These villages, however, are largely " front villages " to which the people congregate for church services and meetings with the government officials. Most people build a second house away from the village and spend a considerable amount of time absent from the village. Significant European contact began in the early 1920's when Lutheran missionaries made patrols through the area. In 1928 Pastor Saueracker opened the Ulap mission station which until just recently served as the main mission head- quarters for the area. Early administrative control was exercised by mission personnel and to this date many of the village leaders persist in taking their legal disputes to the mission authorities for solution. Government patrols into the hinterland began in the late 1930's. A government patrol post was established at Wasu after World War II and was later moved to Kalalo. In i960 a patrol post was opened at Kabwum and an agricultural station established. Soon both NAMASU and FMDS established trading companies in the area and Kabwum became the economic focal point of the hinterland.4 The hinterland is administered from Kabwum and the coastal area is administered from Kalalo. In mid-1967 the Lutheran Mission stationed a missionary near Kabwum to oversee the mission's interests in the hinterland. With the elevation of the patrol post at Kabwum to the status of a sub-district office in late 1967, and with the opening of two airstrips in the Kwama basin, an additional trading company has entered the sub-district and the economic potential of the area is expanding. The year is divided into two seasons, the dry and the wet. Annual rainfall varies from 80 inches in the sheltered valleys to over 200 inches on the windward slopes of the ranges. The people are agriculturalists so that climatic conditions are very important. Their staples are taro, yam and sweet potato. In addition to a number of indigenous vegetables the people regularly cultivate potatoes, onions, cabbage, pumpkin, beans, tomatoes and corn. During the dry season (April- November), there is a general abundance of food with the most productive months being May through August when the staples bear fruit. Correspondingly, during the wet season (November-April), there is a shortage of food and during January and February the people forage for food in the old garden sites. Cash cropping of coffee as well as migrant labour provides the base for their money economy. Unfortunately, during the wet seasons when food is short, climatic conditions frequently force closure of the local airstrips and thus deprive the people of sufficient imported food supplies. As a result, disenchantment with the Europeans reaches a peak each year during the wet season. The three languages, Timbe, Selepet and Komba, show a high lexical relation- ship : Timbe-Selepet 57-9%, Timbe-Komba 51-4%, Selepet-Komba 657%. Bilin- gualism is common, particularly between Selepet and Timbe speakers whose languages bear close structural relationship. Although the Komba language is structurally 4 NAMASU (Native Marketing and Supply) is closely associated with the Lutheran Mission. FMDS (Finschhafen Marketing and Development Society) is associated with the Department of Agriculture. For a brief history of FMDS see McSherry (1962).</page><page sequence="3">176 CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB^-DISTRICT diverse, the Komba people have little difficulty in learning either Timbe or Selepet. The reverse, however, is not true. Marriage arrangements between villages of separate linguistic groups are not uncommon with the result that kin ties often cross linguistic boundaries thus encouraging bilingualism. Furthermore, the use of both Neo-Melanesian (Pidgin English) and Kate (the church language) as trade languages increases the capacity for effective communication. ^^ KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT / 5 I / I ;nalalo f \\ V [n 1 m'ulap % ,--,......., "ia" 1 I • )\ \Sitop f' / "ia" i(^/T^k. 1 I • )\ \Sitop f' ( /•-" fmik--v&gt;..&gt; ;/A ';k°mba &gt;«Siü "•-x^Ov &lt;1 y / \ •' T'?slt /#v '*\ • '' / ( p*"1* s- r^ Sr \; I W&lt; ( «j y ^ N - ^ V\ \^.J; § fj • f / ^ I ^- ^ Map i Due to the nature of the terrain, travel in an east-west direction is very hazardous. Travel in a north-south direction along the ridges and travel around the perimeter of the basins is relatively easy and these routes mark the normal channels of communication. In aboriginal times a main trade route began at the coast near Sio, cut westward across the lower Kwama gorge, wound up the Pungine valley, and crossed back again into the headwaters of the upper Kwama gorge before terminating at Iloko in the upper Komba. From Iloko sporadic contact was made with the non-Austronesian peoples south of the Saruwaged range. Other trade routes linked the Komba people at Melandum and Wanam with the Nomu-speaking people of the Kalasa area and the Burum-speaking people of the Mindik area respectively. The Timbe people have a few links with the Selepet and Komba</page><page sequence="4">CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT 177 people, the most important of which are through the villages of Indum (Selepet) and Tipsit (Komba). In general, the major line of communication connects the Komba with the Selepet people in a continual chain of villages stretching from Melandum in the east, around the Kwama basin, and down the Pumune valley through Satop in the west. New ideas are frequently passed along this chain and the Timbe people only indirectly benefit through their connections at Indum and Tipsit. There is a constant flow of Timbe travellers passing through Indum village on their way to and from the trading centre at Kabwum and these are the ones who carry news back into the Timbe basin. News usually travels in a westwardly direction so that many new ideas enter the system from Kalasa through Melandum and from Mindik through Wanam. Correspondingly, few new ideas enter the system from the west. The Timbe people are the westernmost group within the Huon Micro-phylum and appear to have little contact with the peoples of the Finisterre Micro-phylum to their west. The Austronesian peoples of the coast have been traditionally regarded as enemies and with the disintegration of the indigenous trading system, contact between the coastal and mountain peoples is decreasing. Spirit Beliefs The material world was largely the creation of a number of spirit beings resembling culture heroes. They were anthropomorphic and were either male or female. These spirit beings not only created and introduced the material culture but also taught the first humans how to use it. After introducing such items as bark cloth, weapons, tools, pigs and garden produce, the spirit beings died and turned into prominent physical formations : cliffs, caves, springs, etc. Once the beings were dead they ceased to have any further relevance to the maintenance of society. Since Christianisation, many people have substituted Anutu (God) for these spirit beings.5 He is the agent who has sole responsibility for the creation of the physical universe. Since, however, Anutu is thought of as being primarily the European's God, he is generally thought of as the European's culture hero who created and continues to create and supply the European's material culture. He is in no way thought of as having created the material culture of the indigene. In primeval time Anutu had direct relations with all humanity. However, as a result of Ham's sin - Ham is regarded as the progenitor of the black people - the understanding of the indigene was clouded and he was cut off from direct communication with Anutu. As a result, the understanding of the European became more clever and his material culture became more elaborate while the indigenous culture remained stagnant. The indigene became inherently sinful and ignorant while the European remained 5 Note Lawrence's comment regarding the Madang District : " Hence just as Christian leadership had to be assimilated to the pattern of native society, the only way in which Christian doctrine could be widely intelligible in an unchanged environment was for it to be interpreted in terms of indigenous religious concepts rather than of European spiritual values " (Lawrence, 1956: 85).</page><page sequence="5">178 CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT pure and knowledgeable. As is mentioned in the course of this paper, the European is regarded as having many methods of communication with Anutu which are not available to the indigene. In pre-European times an individual's well-being depended upon his keeping harmonious relations with the spirit world as well as his effective use of sorcery and and counter-sorcery. The spirit world comprises three kinds of spirits : the manifold bush spirits seduk baneard, the powerful bush men hewukye lok and the ancestral spirits. The seduk banearà were always malevolent and never placated. These spirits inhabited trees, peculiarly-shaped rocks, caves and dark places in the forest, but not springs. They were simply to be avoided and should contact be made it was possible to deceive and elude them. A few of these spirits were well known and had personal names. More powerful than these bush spirits were the hewtikye lok which owned and oversaw particular land formations. These were commonly referred to as " the owner of such and such place ". When a man had to get timber or other forest products from the forest he would placate the owner of that area. Without first placating the owner, he was sure to incur the wrath of the offended spirit. The most important spirits were the ancestral spirits. These spirits were regularly worshipped and in its most primitive stage this worship involved no more than burying the deceased male near the home, perhaps under it, and maintaining the grave site. When a man wanted to invoke the spirit he would go down to the grave site, walk around on it and rub it. By so doing he would arouse the spirit and then verbally remind it of its obligations. As a repayment for adequate worship, the ancestral spirit protected and provided for his descendants. In particular, the spirit was expected to multiply the pigs, cause the gardens to produce abundantly and give a man many healthy offspring. No one would know sickness or hard times. However, should the surviving relatives neglect such duties, the offended spirit would become malevolent and cause sickness and crop failure. After many years two important men, Irján and Wahapdà, died and their eldest sons carved images to represent them. Rather than visiting the site of the graves, the sons directly invoked the spirits embodied in the images. Out of this simple beginning grew a male cult which was later identified with the cult of Làpio or Porom which had a scattered distribution throughout the Morobe District.6 The male cult rites were participated in by all adult male members of a lineage. Each lineage practised the ceremonies in their own club house. Most club houses contained only one Lapio-Porotn image, although a few club houses apparently contained twin images. The lineage leader served as the local practitioner and performed priestly duties at the altar of Làpio-Porom as well as performing the healing arts, hawat • This cult appears to have been quite widespread in North-east New Guinea, ranging from the Kabwum and Finschhafen Sub-districts (where it was known as Làpio or Porom) to the Nabak area north of Lae (where it was known as Ndpio) and perhaps as far south as the Guhu-Samane near Garaina (where it was known as Poro - see Richert, 1965). For a description of the Làpio cult in Komba see Schmitz (1961).</page><page sequence="6">CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT 179 " white magic ". This man, lok kabukrje " forbidden man ", was mainly responsible for the worship ceremonies but the well-being of the lineage depended collectively upon the actions of the membership. Regular dances were instituted to please the spirits of these two men and elaborate ceremonies including food offerings were devised to ensure the spirits' co-operation and good-will. The net result was an institutionalised form of the ancestor worship which previously was practised by individuals. The worship of Lapio-Porom did not completely supplant the usual individual ancestor worship so that the two were carried on at the same time. In addition to a Lapio-Porom image, the men's houses also contained another image called hop kakrjan " on the harvest rack ". The essence of this worship was that the harvest rack of every house should be kept full by an abundance of food. Every man prayed to his personal hop kaktjan saying : Give me mothers and fathers (possibly an allusion to productive trade partnerships) and many kinds of things. Give them to me free. Make whatever I plant in my garden to multiply freely and when I walk on the trail help me to find things. My wives and children must remain healthy and be productive. This image was also used in fertility rites. When the people were confronted with the superior material culture of the European missionaries, their reaction was typical of so many primitive peoples. They discarded many of their traditional practices and submitted to the instruction of the European. Many indigenes thought the Europeans were spirits. The people firmly believed that the Europeans had come to set them straight and teach them a better method for obtaining the blessings from the ancestors. When the Europeans forbade the cult ceremonies, these were immediately supplanted by various European ceremonies. The forms were substituted but the functions remained the same. The Christian teachings were interpreted in terms of the indigenous religious values. Thus baptism became a purity and fertility rite, confirmation took on the significance of initiation, and communion was part of the ritual worship of Anutu. When the mission forbade the practices of ear and septum piercing and instructed the adult men to leave the club house and cohabit with their wives, all of these commands as well as many others were interpreted as having a magico-religious basis. Just as every aspect of their daily life was influenced by the spirits or some form of magic, they interpreted the most innocuous activities of the European as having a magico- religious basis in the European's life. Thus the conditions developed which fostered a Christianity-based cargoism. When the allegiance to the instructions of the European failed to produce a dramatic change in the level of the indigene's wealth, disillusionment followed. For more than twenty years there has been no large scale cargo cult activity among the mountain peoples of the sub-district. Cargoism, however, as a system of thought pervades every area of their lives. The European generally is misunderstood and misinterpreted. Under questioning, the indigene gives the answers which he thinks the European wants to hear. The remainder of this paper presents a number of</page><page sequence="7">i8o CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT examples illustrating how the indigenes continue to interpret (within their own traditional framework) both the scientific and religious instruction given by Europeans. Scientific Syncretism Cosmological and Meteorological Events One day after a European had explained the planetary system in Neo- Melanesian, one of the leading and most educated men translated the story into Selepet : This is the way it is. Only the earth turns and the sun stays above in one place. Light shines from the sun and when part of the earth revolves, it goes into the shaded area and it becomes night. The other part of the earth goes into the bright area and it becomes day. When it is day in America it is night here. Then the earth continues to turn and America goes into the shaded area and our ground goes into the bright area and it becomes day here. Thus when it is night in America it is daytime here. Furthermore, as the earth revolves, the portion of it belonging to Selepet comes to the place of rain and then it rains very hard. Then, it revolves further and comes to the place of sunshine and the sun shines for a long time. (An explanation of the seasons.) As it continues to turn, it comes to a place of sickness and death and then we all become sick and many die. When it goes to a place of health we live well. When it goes to a place of famine we live with hunger. When it goes to a place of abundance we have plenty ; our gardens produce well. But just now we are hungry and starving. It has gone to a place of famine and we are hungry. This ground (Selepet), however, has not yet gone to a good place, a place of abundance. When it does so in the future, then we will find all kinds of things. That is the way it is. It is not difficult to abstract this man's belief regarding the cosmos. The explanation of the cause of night and day and the fact that when New Guinea is in the earth's dark side the United States is in the earth's light side was clear to him. His interpretation of the cause of the seasons was incorrect since he had not understood the movement of the earth around the sun but had rather interpreted the axial revolutions of the earth as the primary cause. He went beyond this, however, and interpreted some of their traditional beliefs regarding sickness, famine, abundance, etc. within the same framework. Traditionally there was no reason to separate the cause of night and day, of wet and dry seasons from such concepts as the cause of hunger, sickness and death. The resulting synthesis is a belief that the earth is ball-shaped. Surrounding the earth are shadows or areas which contain the essential qualities of night, day, rainstorms, fair weather, famine, abundance, sickness, death and goodness. As the earth revolves on its axis, certain portions of it come under the influence of the overshadowing area. Thus, it is daylight in America and night-time in New Guinea. Thus it is often cold in America and hot in New Guinea. .And correspondingly, there is abundance in America and famine and poverty in</page><page sequence="8">CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT 181 New Guinea. " This ground, however, has not yet gone to a good place, a place of abundance." It is only a matter of time before it does so. Cosmological events appear to have always had a supernatural basis in the minds of the Selepet people. An eclipse of the sun or a strong earthquake were thought to herald the return of the ancestors. On one occasion following a severe earthquake the Indum people assembled on the bank of the Pumune river to await their ancestors and whatever blessings they may have been expected to bring back with them. Since European contact, an eclipse or severe earthquake is often associated with the return of Christ, who will come directly from heaven and show them the way to heaven (the depository for cargo). Meteorological events were believed to be caused or controlled by human intervention. Rainstorms could be created by putting beans on the shore of a mountain lake, and particularly heavy storms were caused by slapping the water in the lake. When a rainstorm was descending down the mountain side, a man simply positioned lengths of wild sugar cane facing the storm on the correct angle and pronounced the incantation yàritj be kirjkif) " Abracadabra " and immediately the thunder would stop and the rain would cease.7 It never ceases to amaze the Selepet people that Europeans are able to predict eclipses. Knowledge of a coming eclipse can only have a divine source and such knowledge presupposes control over the event. Thus the Europeans are said to have the power to cause an eclipse, and when the predicted eclipse occurs, it is another demonstration of the religious power of the European. Recently during a full eclipse of the moon, an indigene remarked in a mixture of Kate and Neo-Melanesian to the resident missionary, o mési bilong Atnerika, " Oh, a miracle caused by Americans ". Geography One evening when the writer was in the Eastern Highlands District, his two Selepet informants came with this question : We do not believe this but some of the old men back in the village do. Is it true that people can see heaven from America ? Is it true that Americans (i.e. Europeans) regularly go back and forth to heaven ? We know that when one leaves America he travels and eventually comes to England. Next he comes to Germany, then Africa, India, China and finally New Guinea. America is first and New Guinea is last. Therefore, is it not true that Americans see heaven and travel back and forth from earth to heaven. The question of the two young men gives some clues into their reasoning. The European's God is essentially a cargo deity who supplies all the European's desires. America is the focal point of cargo- a conclusion which may have been derived 7 European contact has driven many of these practices underground. It is difficult to say whether these particular beliefs and practices are still widely held today. It is often said that destructive rainstorms and other ill fortune are Anutu's punishments for evil acts. B</page><page sequence="9">i82 CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT from hearing about the influx of war materiel at Finschhafen, one of the largest supply depots in the South Pacific during World War II. Since God is in heaven and heaven is the depository of cargo, and since the Europeans (especially Americans) have all the cargo, then heaven must be near America and readily accessible to Americans. Thus Americans are thought to make frequent trips to heaven in order to replenish their supplies. Coupled with the belief that Americans make regular visits to heaven is the belief that few, if any, New Guineans enter heaven. When a European dies, his spirit automatically goes to heaven. But a New Guinean's spirit is tried at the door and is usually refused admittance. Thereupon, the spirit of the New Guiñean returns to haunt its surviving relatives and do harm to those who might have offended the deceased. Since the Europeans are thought to control the source and supply of the cargo it is logical for the indigene to assume that European spirits of the dead go directly to heaven and then play an active role in the supply of cargo. The Europeans are able to obtain the cargo from their ancestors by direct visits, placing direct orders or performing the correct ritual. Unfortunately, New Guinea is a long way from heaven and the New Guiñean spirits of the dead do not get to heaven. Religious Syncretism Just as some of the people interpret current European teachings about cosmology and geography within the traditional framework, so have some interpreted Christianity and European customs within the same framework. The form of the church worship service is often accorded the same sort of power attributed to the rituals and prayers of the traditional religious practitioner, lok kdbukye. The pastors and elders of the church have taken over many of the functions of lok kabukrje. This accommodation of the same function to new forms is understandable in light of the mission's use of the Kate term jambuy in the Scriptures and church terminology. The term jamburj is translated " charm, spell, blessing " (Pilhofer, 1953 : 20) and in every case is rendered by its equivalent in the Kabwum Sub-district languages : Timbe, guian ; Selepet, hawat ; and Komba, mosop.8 In traditional religious practices the lok kdbukfje was the sole practitioner of hawat " white magic ", and when the mission came teaching a new hawat, a miti hawat " the white magic of the Gospel ", the lok kdbukfje were immediately rejected for the pastors who were the practitioners of the new hawat. The basis was laid for the people to misinterpret the intent and teachings of the mission. 8 The method apparently used by the mission was to retain the indigenous religious terms to express Christian religious concepts rather than to introduce foreign terms. Attempts were then made to change the meaning of these terms through instruction so that they would no longer have the traditional meaning but rather have the desired Christian meaning. Since, however, in the Kabwum Sub-district, the Christian doctrine has for the most part been interpreted in terms of traditional religious values, these terms have largely retained their traditional meaning.</page><page sequence="10">CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB^-DISTRICT 183 The following is an English rendering of a Selepet translation of a number of Scripture passages in Kate. These passages illustrate what could easily be construed as the basis for a cargoistic interpretation of Christianity. Genesis 12 : 2-3. And I (Anutu) will work white magic for you (Abraham) and your descendants will become plenteous and your name will endure. And you will become the head (leader) of those associated with white magic. Those who work white magic for you will likewise have white magic done for them by me. And those who work sorcery on you will likewise have sorcery done to them by me. Genesis 39 : 5. And Potiphar made Joseph the custodian of his house, his money and his cargo (wealth). At that time the Lord did white magic for Joseph and the men of Egypt. And there was enough white magic to be sufficient for all things, things in the house and things in the garden. Acts 3 : 25-26. You are descendants of the prophets and Anutu made a covenant (continuing thing) with your ancestors. You are the same as those who were given the covenant (the owners of the covenant). He (Anutu) gave the covenant to Abraham and spoke like this. " I will work white magic on your children and that white magic will go to all the inhabited areas (of the earth). " And Anutu thought about you and began by sending his son and he came down and was born. That one converted all of you from your heathen ways and he did it in order to work white magic for you. Mark 10 : 15-16. I (Jesus) will tell you the truth. A man who has the appearance of a child and who does not pray to Anutu from his heart, he will not go inside (heaven). (Note : In Selepet the child is considered to be irresponsible, not innocent. Thus the passage proved difficult and was rein- terpreted.) Speaking like this, he brought them (the children) together, put his hand on their heads and did white magic for them. Ephesians 1 : 3. Because our Lord, the father and Anutu of Jesus, helped us on behalf of Jesus and gave us the basis for every kind of Christian (church, Gospel) white magic, we will do all things well. Hebrews 6 : 7. The rain always falls upon the ground and makes it soft. Then men plant and produce food. Therefore, because of Anutu's white magic the produce appears. Romans 15 : 29. And I (Paul) know. I will not come to you empty- handed. I will come to you with the essence of the Gospel (Christianity), i.e., the white magic from Jesus. In aboriginal times the people relied on the proper use of hawat magic in many of their daily activities. The local practitioner was called upon to relieve illness by the use of the medicinal arts or counter-sorcery. He was also responsible for performing magic when gardens were planted and any major undertaking started. When the church teachings replaced the traditional magic, they too entered every area of the indigene's life. In nearly every instance, when an informant related an account of the traditional worship, he added the statement that now it is just the</page><page sequence="11">i84 CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT same with God. Previously they had prayed to the ancestors and performed white magic, but now they pray to God and rely on him to meet their desires. Today, when there is sickness in a family, the pastor and the church elders gather together to pray for the sick person. When a village undertaking is to be completed these men again meet and the people ask Anutu to bless (i.e., perform hawat magic) the productivity. Recently, a man returned with his wife from working in the gold mines at Wau. His wife was barren and he wanted the elders to pray for her. As an added incentive he left $Aio.oo in the church treasury with the instruction that a portion of the cash be given to the appropriate consanguineal kin should his wife not conceive. His belief was reinforced when his wife conceived a few months later. Whenever an important " rite of passage " is to be performed the people state hawat menomai } " They will perform white magic " (i.e., " They will receive a blessing "). The earliest and most important " rite of passage " is baptism. The infants are presented to the pastor during the worship service and water is stroked across the brow of the infant. Then follows a prayer and a statement of belief on the part of the parents. This act has some parallels in a traditional fertility rite. In this rite the men would dance around a decorated coconut and make passes at the coconut with their adzes. At the high point of the dance, one of the men would cleave the coconut and the participants would smear the coconut milk upon their brows, their bodies, their pigs and their plant seedlings. This made the participants pure and protected them against sickness and sorcery. Productivity of crops was also ensured. The confirmation classes and ceremony are viewed as a substitution for the traditional initiation rites. Rather than just the young men being instructed in the secret lore of the men's cult, all the young people are taught the essentials of Christianity. Recently, when a village trade store was built, the village people gathered together and one of the village elders confided màsi otnom " We will work a miracle ". Another elder rose and delivered a sermon from the occasion when Christ took the five loaves of bread and two fish and worked a miracle (mast) by feeding a crowd of 5,000 men plus their dependants. Although the implications were never openly stated, they were obvious. As Christ worked a miracle and 5,000 were fed by five loaves of bread and two fish, so also should Anutu work a miracle and the village store would provide an abundance of food. Many people are convinced that the European does not work for his material wealth. During World War II, local men were recruited as labourers and taken to Finschhafen and Rabaul. At Finschhafen, they saw countless numbers of ships arrive with unimaginable riches. Most of the leading men were at Finschhafen and they still reflect upon the days when there was an overabundance of food and the Europeans literally " stuffed us full of food, rice, meat and biscuits ". After the war, the war materiel was loaded on ships and trucks and dumped into the sea. The conclusion of some of the New Guineans was " If they (the Europeans) would have made the stuff themselves then they would have taken it along when they</page><page sequence="12">CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT 185 went. Because it had come up by itself (i.e., by magical means) they left it behind " (Wagner, 1964 : 105 - parentheses mine). Some of the people evidence the attitude that perhaps the European has not shared all of his knowledge of and methods for dealing with Anutu. One day a village elder entered the writer's home and looked at the pictures of early Egyptian images in TIME magazine. When he asked for an explanation, the writer recalled to the man's memory how the man's ancestors used to carve images and worship them. In like manner, it was explained, some of the Europeans' ancestors made images and worshipped them. After the coming of Christ, however, many of the Europeans ceased to worship these images and accepted Christianity. After some thought, the elder asked, " Tell me ! Was it a long time ago or just recently that you Europeans gave up praying to statues and got two-way radios ? " Apparently this elder thought that the European was not limited to talking to Anutu through prayer as was the New Guiñean, but rather the European had a direct line to Anutu. Europeans have been accused of selfishness and unwillingness to share their cargo. Furthermore, they do not share the secrets by which they obtain that cargo. The New Guineans have prayers but the Europeans have two-way radios. It is openly stated by village leaders that their present condition of poverty is partially a result of not adequately following the teachings of the Europeans. All Europeans are considered to have special connections with Anutu. Their possession of cargo indicates this. Consequently, there is often no distinction made between what the European considers secular or sacred. Government gazetted holidays have equal value with Sundays, and just as rest must be observed on Sundays, so also must it be observed on holidays. Those who work on holidays contribute to the failure of the group to keep all the laws of the European. If only everyone would abide by the laws, then everything would be all right. Conclusion Some of the people, including leaders, have expressed dissatisfaction with the mission. " After forty years of contact ", so they say, " the mission has given us nothing. We have realized no gain from their presence ". What this really means is that the mission has not completely - and never could have - fulfilled the expecta- tions of these people. These people expected that by following the teachings of the church and the form of the worship service, somehow the material benefits associated with the European would also be theirs. " Furthermore ", say these people, " the government has not helped either ". They view each patrol officer as a new administration and they look to each one with renewed hope. This help they look for is in the form of grants and gifts, not co- operation and leadership which may demand exertion on their part. In text material relating to the history of Indum village, the leading village figure had this to say : In the beginning, the Gospel came and we were afraid. Now Ken, our white man, has come and we are not afraid, neither will we be afraid. He lives with</page><page sequence="13">i86 CURRENT CARGO BELIEFS IN THE KABWUM SUB-DISTRICT us here and he will show us very many things and very many new paths to follow. He will straighten us out and then he will go. We pin our hopes on him. It is apparent from the above that these people are seeking a new road, a new way of life. They are willing to try anything new in order to realize their desires. When it was announced that the people would be getting a local government council, their thoughts immediately turned to the material benefits which might be derived by following a new road. When the parliamentary elections were held, they put their hope in a new leader who was going to Port Moresby where the white man's central control is thought to reside. New ideas enter the Kabwum Sub-district from the Kalasa and Mindik areas in the East. Recently an indigene from the Kalasa area travelled through the Kabwum Sub-district and collected thousands of dollars for a new welfare society. This society is to provide the vehicles and roads necessary for the mountain peoples to reach the economic centres on the coast. Over the years there have been a number of cargo movements in the Kalasa area (Wagner, 1964). In early 1967 there was a movement in the upper Burum (east of Wanam in the Komba) which had cargo overtones. Periodic cargo cults seem to be a regular phenomenon in the upper Burum. Harding (1967a) provided what he called the " first chapter " of a history of cargoism in the Sio area. This paper has stated some of the current beliefs found among the hinterland peoples. With the dissatisfaction evident among many of these people it seems like it may be just a matter of time before the second chapter will be in the making.
