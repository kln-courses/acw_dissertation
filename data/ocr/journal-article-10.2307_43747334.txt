To meet younger students' curiosity, we adapted a middle - school level, penguin -themed curriculum unit called Save the Penguins (Schnittka, Bell, and Richards 2010) for third -grade students. The students loved learn- ing about penguins that live all over the world and in various climates. This three-day interdisciplinary sci- ence unit allows students to explore their own ideas about penguins, temperature, and heat. Our students even used engineering to design miniature dwellings to protect models of South African penguins from climate change and attacks by gulls. Specifically, the objectives of the unit are for students to (1) describe where penguins live, some features of warm and cold climate penguins, and the climate issue affecting penguin populations; (2) compare the temperatures for each given sample of material and describe which mate- rials prevent heat transfer the best; (3) construct a small shelter for a penguin -shaped ice cube so that at least half the penguin mass remains after being placed in a thermal oven for 20 minutes; and (4) describe that heat travels more slowly through some materials than others and that 50 Science and Children</page><page sequence="2">Penguin glyph key.

We used the 5E Learning Cycle model (BSCS 1989) to achieve these objectives because it is a proven method of teaching science. Background African penguins are warm climate penguins and live on islands and the coasts of Africa. At Boulders Beach, in Cape Town, South Africa, many African penguins can be spotted swimming in the ocean. Many of the African penguin colonies that once bred no longer do (see Inter- net Resources). In 1956, there were reportedly 150,000 pairs of African penguins. In 2009, it was concluded that there were only 26,000 breeding pairs. The African pen- guin has officially been declared endangered (see Inter- net Resources). The main reasons for the rapid decline of the African penguin population include overfishing of sardines and anchovies (their main food sources), pré- dation by seals, oil pollution, habitat disturbance, and their eggs being taken away as food. One reason penguin eggs are disturbed is increasing temperatures. When the parent penguin leaves the nest to cool off in the water, the egg is vulnerable to prédation by gulls. At Boulders Beach, shelters have been placed along the beach to help protect the penguins from the heat, as well as provide them a place to safely lay their eggs (Nullis 2009). The students in our class were challenged to build their own shelter for the penguins at Boulders Beach to help protect and save the species. However, because we could not actually travel to South Africa, we created a model of the beach with a sand- and rock -lined box and lamps shining into it. Instead of living creatures, we used penguin-shaped ice cubes that melt if not kept cool. Our students could see how an ice penguin in the model beach melted in less than 1 0 minutes if not protected. Their task was to keep their ice penguin cool, just like the park rangers at Boulders Beach came up with a solution to shelter the South African penguins from the Sun. Building shelters for protection from the weather is something young students can relate to. In their everyday lives they experience beach umbrellas, bus shelters, forts in the woods, and the protection of their own homes. In this unit, the children become empathetic with the plight of the penguins and develop a sense of identity with them. The students even have an innate sense of how shelters block heat transfer and how colors and different materials affect heat transfer. Their experiences trying to stay warm in the winter and cool in the summer help them build on prior conceptions about how materials can help keep them cool or warm. These prior conceptions are tested as they begin designing and building a shelter to protect a penguin-shaped ice cube from the heat of the Sun. See NSTA Connection for more background information on thermal energy and light energy. Engage First, we got students excited about penguins and opened their eyes to the different species that live in the world. There are 17 species of penguins, but we created a Pow- erPoint presentation displaying four species of penguins living in different natural habitats: Adelie, Galapagos, African, and Emperor. The students observed that some penguins live in warm climates, whereas others live in cold climates. Through the images projected for the class, we made sure to prompt the students with questions that stimulated their prior knowledge. For example, "How many different species of penguins do you think there are?" Where do penguins live?" "Can penguins live in warm weather?" "Which species of penguins have you ever learned about before?" "Have you ever seen pen- guins?" We were able to determine that although some students knew a few things about penguins, none of the students knew that there were penguins living in warm climates. We also showed students a video of African penguins swimming with children at the beach (the stu- dents loved this!) (see Internet Resources).

A vital part of the Engage stage is to assess students' knowledge about the topic of study. To do this, we had each student create a penguin glyph (Figure 1, p. 51). In making their glyphs, the students had to choose their favorite species of penguin and then identify how much they had previously learned about penguins. Glyphs are a common, symbolic way for elementary students to convey information nonverbally. Although anthropomorphism of animals is generally not acceptable in science lessons, this glyph activity served to help students identify with penguins and set the stage for the science lessons to follow. See Internet Resources for the activity, which we adapted. Explore On the second day of the unit, we explained what our culminating activity was going to be. We told the stu- dents that each group would receive an "African Pen- guin" (a small, penguin- shaped ice cube; search online for the ice trays) that they had to design a shelter for. This shelter would need to protect their penguin from the hot Sun (desk lamps) for 20 minutes. The students were immediately excited at the opportunity to build and design their own shelters. The day before, we had prepared each penguin- shaped ice cube with 10 ml of water. We used a medical syringe so it would be exact. 52 Science and Children</page><page sequence="4">Penguin-shaped ice cubes were useful as well as cute! Save the Boulders Beach Penguins Because the density of water is 1 g/ ml, the starting mass of each penguin would be 10 g once frozen. We organized the students into six groups of four students each. Each group was given a desk lamp, two digital thermometers, and a basket of materials. Be sure to instruct students to keep their hands, clothing, /¡v and materials away from the lamp. Also, secure / ; ' any lamp cords that run along the floor. We pro- vided students with 25 cm x 25 cm squares of different - colorfelt, paper, aluminum foil, shiny Mylar, craft foam, and cotton balls. (See NSTA Connection for a complete list of materials for this unit and sources for purchasing them.) In structured inquiry fashion, students were given the question, the materials, and the directions for testing the materials under the desk lamps. Before set- ting them free, we gave each person in each group a job. Each group consisted of a recorder, a timer, a materials manager, and a thermometer reader. Each group received a table (Figure 2) listing the materials we wanted them to test under the heat lamp. Two materials were tested at a time. The timer made sure that each material was over the thermometers for two minutes before the other student read the temperatures to their recorder. The light was turned off, and thermometers were dipped in room -temperature water after testing each material to provide a consistent starting temperature. Because the table tended to warm up, the lamp was moved a little bit for each trial. The goal of this activity was for the stu- dents to develop ideas about which types of materials would best prevent heat transfer and protect their penguin from the heat source. Explain As soon as a group finished testing their materials, we had them go to various places in the room where they could sit and talk. The groups discussed their results and what they thought about those results. We walked around from group to group listening, providing feedback, and asking probing questions. For example, we might ask, "Why do you think it was hotter under the black foam than under the white foam?" and "Why do you think it was colder under the white paper than under the bubble wrap?" "What color shirt shouldn't you wear on a hot, sunny day? Why not?" "What col- or is the roof on your dwelling? Do you think people in Texas have different color roofs than people in Maine?" Students started making connections between their own homes and clothing choices with the penguin dwelling. Then, each group verbally brainstormed and drew a cor- responding picture as an idea for how they were going to build their shelter the following day. This time period allowed the students to talk about their ideas with each other and think about and discuss what designs and what materials were going to work the best. To help them vi- sualize the ice cube penguin inside the shelter, we made a set of penguins out of plaster of paris in the ice cube tray. This enabled students to hold the penguins and use them in the design process (e.g., in planning for a way for the penguin to enter and exit the dwelling). Elaborate On day three, we returned the students' tables to them (with all of their results) and gave them back their bas- ket of materials along with scissors and tape. We sent the groups off into their spaces and allowed them to keep exploring their ideas about heat, temperature, and how to "save the Boulders Beach penguins." While walking around, it was great to hear the different ideas that the students had. During this time, we also gave the groups a design sheet (see NSTA Connection) that asked them to draw a picture of their design and label all parts, as well as list all of the materials they planned to use. This drawing could be modified as plans changed. At the bottom of the design sheet, there was a space for the students to record the start- ing mass of the ice penguin ( 1 0 g) and then the mass at the end of the experiment. Then, students had to calculate the difference, which is how much of their penguin melted. We stressed the engineering design process developed by the Boston Museum of Science, encouraging students to think like engineers (see Internet Resources). In this process, students ask questions, imagine solutions, plan solutions, create artifacts, and improve their designs around a specific goal. When all student groups were done with their con- struction, they placed their ice cube penguin inside their dwelling and we placed the dwellings inside the simulated "Boulders Beach," which was a large box with sandpaper and rocks on the bottom, lined with aluminum foil, and</page><page sequence="5">Evaluation rubric.

Because the large box was made from black plastic, the aluminum foil kept the sides from absorbing too much thermal energy and getting hot, and reflected the light so that it bounced around all sides of the dwellings. We turned on the lamps after all the dwellings were in the box and started the timer. During the time the penguins were in their beach dwellings, we did some student evaluation. Evaluate To evaluate the students while their shelters holding the ice penguins were under the lamps for 20 minutes, we read Amazing Animals: Penguins (Bodden 2011). Before reading, students were asked various questions to elicit their current conceptions about penguins. For example, "Where do you think penguins tend to live?" "What do you think is happening to penguins that live in warm cli- mates?' ' "Why do you think penguins have white stom- achs?" "Do you think the male or female penguin takes care of the egg?" "Which penguin species do you think is pictured here?" "Do you think all species of penguins are about the same size?" "Why do you think some spe- cies of penguins huddle together?" It was obvious that the students had learned so much! We made sure that each student was called on to assess the learning progress of the entire class. We allowed students to share everything that they learned about penguins and what they enjoyed learning about the most. The students liked demonstrat- ing their new knowledge about the importance of animal adaptations. It was an authentic assessment of what the students were able to retain. As well as prompting students with questions while reading, we used the design sheet as another form of as- sessment. The sheet demonstrated the students' ability to draw what their group had designed, recognize and name all materials used, and calculate how much of their penguin melted. When 20 minutes had passed, we turned off the lights, and handed each group their dwelling. They rescued their ice penguin and put it on a small square of white construction paper. Students then placed their paper and penguin on the mass scale. They wrote down the mass of their penguin on their design sheet and started doing the math to find out how much of the penguin had melted. The range of final masses was 6.8 g to 8.7 g. Every group achieved the goal of preserving at least half of the 10 g penguin ice cube. Students were proud to show off their experimental results and penguin shelters. If we had another day to continue this unit, we would have had each group take back their shelters and redesign them based on their previ- ous results. Just like how engineers design and redesign, students would have had to think about which design aspects worked well and which did not. After the redesign, we would test the shelters again. We used an evaluation rubric (functioning as a checklist) to guide assessment of students' progress in this unit (Figure 3). Conclusion A New Framework for K-12 Science Teaching (NRC 2011) includes engineering design for all grades. Engineering is now one of the core disciplinary ideas and has students identifying engineering problems, designing solutions around criteria and constraints, and comparing and testing possible solutions. The addition of engineering will likely require a new way of thinking about science teaching, and teachers will be looking for resources and ideas and cur- riculum materials when states adopt new standards. Engi- neering design will not just be taught as an elective to older students who have an interest in engineering as a career; it will be taught as a habit of mind and a 2 1 st-century skill to all students in every grade and at every achievement level. This unit demonstrates that it is not difficult to take an is- sue or problem that students care about, weave in science content, and have them engineer a solution.
