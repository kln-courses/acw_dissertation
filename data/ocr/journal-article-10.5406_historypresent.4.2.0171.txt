<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Story of Big History Ian Hesketh The goal is not to read a book; the goal is to read the story taking place  all around us. —Brian Swimme and Thomas Berry, The Universe Story No one and nothing lives a story. —Hayden White, Tropics of Discourse Consilience has long been the dream of many scientific thinkers, best ex- pressed by the desire for a unified theory that could explain essentially ev- erything.1 Such a desire is based on the assumption that there is a general  unity that underlies the various branches of science, a unity that should  be expressed by a simple and elegant law of nature. “Best of all would be  if underpinning this scheme,” the astrophysicist Paul Davies explained in  regard to a universal theory of physics, “there was some sort of basic physical  principle that bestowed upon it a credibility and elegance, thus commending  it to us on aesthetic as well as scientific grounds.”2 Ideally such a theory would  be best expressed in a “mathematical scheme,” one that could be represented  by a single and simple “formula compact enough to wear on your T-shirt.”3  And even better would be if such a theory could be extended to include not  just the natural sciences but the humanities as well.  Currently, a group of historians is claiming that it might be history that  provides the framework for a scientific and evolutionary account of every- thing. Big History, so named by its foremost practitioner, David Christian,  seeks to unite the two cultures under the framework of an elegant story of  the universe, a history, in the words of fellow practitioner Fred Spier, “that  places human history within the context of cosmic history, from the begin- ning of the universe up until life on Earth today.”4 Big history, it would seem,  is not only a science, but the science, combining the fields of astrophysics,  cosmology, geology, geography, biology, archaeology, anthropology, and  history, not to mention the various sub-disciplines involved, while the  “grand unifying theory” is not best expressed as an elegant mathematical  History of the Present: A Journal of Critical History, Vol. 4, No. 2, Fall 2014.

Along with  appealing to aspects of scientific epistemology or various normative meth- odological personas, such sciences of history have also included as a central  focus a general embarrassment (as in the case of the nineteenth century)  or outright rejection (as in the case of the twentieth) of the narrative mode  of history itself.6 Big historians will claim that their scientific history dif- fers from all previous attempts because science has now become more his- torically based, from evolutionary biology and geology to astrophysics and  climatology. These developments enable big historians to integrate human  history within the historical narratives that are already a well-established  and central component of these historical sciences.7  But this is only part of the story of big history. As well as apparently  conforming to science’s need to generate empirically driven paradigms of  knowledge, big history, more importantly, is doing something different from  previous attempts to bridge the humanities–science divide by appealing to  the aesthetic dimension of science. Big historians do this by constructing a  simple and elegant historical narrative of everything, one that seeks to be  as beautiful and as transformative to human self-understanding as was the  famous 1968 Apollo 8 lunar photo of the Earth rising in the distance that has  been deemed central in influencing this form of what could also be called  “Earthrise” history (see figure 1).8  While we will return to the particular Earthrise dimension of big history  below, it is necessary to stress here the aesthetic appeal of big history, an  appeal that will be apparent to viewers of David Christian’s sleek and im- pressively produced TED (Technology, Entertainment, Design) talk about  big history on YouTube, which has been viewed over 887,500 times (as of  June 2014 ).9 Entitled “The history of our world in 18 minutes,” it is elegant,  it is beautiful, it is simple, and, perhaps most importantly, it is seamless. It  begins with what is apparently a video of an egg being beaten, but something  does not quite seem right about it. “Yes, it is a scrambled egg. But as you  look at it,” Christian explains to his audience, “I hope you’ll begin to feel  just slightly uneasy.”10 The uneasiness comes from the fact that the film is  172 HoP 4_2 text.indd   172 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="3"> History  of the Present Figure 1: The cover of Fred  Spier’s Big History and the Fu- ture of Humanity (2010) is the  famous Apollo 8 Earthrise im- age of 1968.

And the uneasiness does not  dissipate when Christian continues and it becomes clear that this rather un- settling image is somehow a metaphor for the workings of the universe. “We  all know in our heart of hearts,” explains Christian, “that this is not the way  the universe works. A scrambled egg is mush. Tasty mush, but it’s mush. An  egg is a beautiful sophisticated thing.”11 The second law of thermodynamics  tells us that the general tendency of the universe is to move not from mush  to complexity but rather from complexity to mush. “And yet, look around  us. What we see around us is staggering complexity.”12  “So here’s a great puzzle,” Christian declares.13 How is it possible to cre- ate complexity despite the second law of thermodynamics? It turns out that  given the right “Goldilocks conditions,” a concept Christian appropriates  from Spier, complexity can in fact lead to further albeit more fragile com- plexity, which can lead to further complexity, and so on, and each stage of  these moments of creation is “magical.”14 It is this story, argues Christian,  about how the universe creates such astonishing complexity despite the law  of entropy, that “[w]e, as extremely complex creatures, desperately need to  173 HoP 4_2 text.indd   173 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="4"> The Story of Big History know. . . .”15 And it is a story, according to Christian, that can only be told by  surveying “the whole history of the universe.”16  Christian goes on to describe his big history as a series of threshold mo- ments, moments that see sudden forms of complexity appear: the big bang,  the origins of the solar system, life on Earth, as well as the human species.  He argues that the origin of humans signifies a threshold moment because  of our harnessing of the “powerful force” he calls “collective learning,” a force  that is entirely unique to “us.”17 He concludes by describing a new threshold  that is upon us, one where global integration is such that “we seem to have  created a single brain.”18 This is a powerful story, Christian argues, that ev- eryone needs to know, particularly the youngest generation, who he hopes  will learn this story in high school.19 Big history is, after all, our history in  a way that all other histories are not, given their much more narrow focus  on specific topics typically localized to particular regions about particular  groups. As practitioners often like to explain, big history is about us—all of  us. And it is a story that is rather nicely captured in a beautifully produced  timeline that flashes on the big screen at key moments during Christian’s  talk, thereby allowing the viewer to envision this immense tale at a single  glance (see figure 2). We could imagine it fitting on a T-shirt.  When describing the emergence of their new field of knowledge, however,  big historians do not reflect on the aesthetic and even performative nature of  their endeavour, an aesthetic that is put to powerful rhetorical use in Chris- tian’s TED talk. It is true that big historians openly embrace the fact that what  they are constructing is a story, a grand narrative of everything, and even go  so far as to call it a “modern creation myth” for the way in which it apparently  deals with the deepest of human questions and anxieties.20 Yet this central  aspect of their work has not received the attention it deserves compared  to other aspects of big history such as its connections with the historical  and empirical dimensions of science. The aesthetic dimension of science  is appealed to in the Earthrise story of humanity itself, but is left largely  unexplored in discussions of just what big historians are doing when they  tell us “our story.” In this article, I contextualize the form of the big history  narrative in order to understand the aesthetic and therefore moral choices  that have been made in constructing this grand anthropocentric tale.  Indeed, despite the apparent novelty of big history, the story it tells is  already quite well known; it has been emplotted in advance. Readers will  at the very least be familiar with parts of the story that have been told by the  174 HoP 4_2 text.indd   174 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="5"> HoP 4_2 text.indd   175 9/26/14   8:30 AM Figure 2: The “big history” timeline from David Christian’s TED talk.

But in this act of synthesis, big historians borrow not  just the facts that are produced in these disciplines but, more importantly,  the rhetorical tropes of the science literature that popularizes this work,  tropes that in a very general way imbue the science being popularized with  an anthropomorphic quality.  By focusing on the way in which the story of big history is told, it becomes  clear that there is little to distinguish big history from the genre of popular  science that often quite openly engages in the project of remythologizing the  scientific facts that are developed in order ultimately to transform human self  understanding. This connection is most clear between big history and the  evolutionary epic, a subgenre of popular science writing that also seeks to  tell a synthetic anthropocentric cosmic history of everything. Not only are big  historians appropriating the science recounted in these portrayals, they are  also appropriating the literary and genre conventions, which explains some  of big history’s seemingly peculiar rhetorical strategies such as the appeal  to myth, the epic mode of emplotment, and the futuristic, moralistic, and  compensatory conclusions. By considering big history as a genre of litera- ture, and by historicizing the narrative choices made by big historians, we  will come to a fuller understanding of big history as both a form of historical  writing and as a science. The Myth of Big History While the big history approach is often presented as a recent one, Chris- tian has been promoting and teaching this kind of history for decades; he  wrote a programmatic article in 1991, and his own big book on the subject  appeared in 2004.21 Other big history monographs include those written  by Fred Spier (2010) and Cynthia Stokes Brown (2007).22 Christian’s is no  doubt the most formative of the three works, written primarily to integrate  human history with the story of the universe told by cosmologists like Eric  Chaisson, though the sections on human history take up a sizable majority of  the rather large monograph.23 Spier’s more recent and much slimmer volume  tells the whole story as well, but spends much less time on human history  and focuses instead on establishing a unifying theory of big history, linking  the entire evolution of the cosmos along with human history to a theory of  Goldilocks circumstances and energy flows, a theory that Christian has also  integrated with his concept of “collective learning.”24 176 HoP 4_2 text.indd   176 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="7"> History  of the Present  Even though all three works are certainly marketed for trade audiences as  well as specialists, Brown’s work is more specifically directed at the general  reader, written from the perspective of a retired professional historian at- tempting to understand the history of humanity within the broadest possible  context. It is certainly possible to read these works as a return to universal  history as well as the speculative philosophy of history—two kinds of his- torical writing that only a few decades ago appeared to be marginalized.25  The difference, big historians would claim, is that big history is based on the  most up-to-date scientific and historical knowledge, and, what is more, that  the scientific and historical knowledge that has emerged in the twentieth  and early twenty-first century has made it possible to write a fact-based  universal history of humanity and the cosmos. The grand speculations of big  history, it is claimed, unlike those of previous universal histories, are based  on a foundation in empirical and inductive scientific and historical work.  In this regard, there are three relatively recent historical processes that are  often discussed in order to explain the emergence of big history as a novel  and truly scientific form of history. The first is a development from within  the discipline of history proper. In the last thirty years, global and world his- tory have moved from the periphery to the center of disciplinary orthodoxy,  transforming our understanding of well-established historiographical eras,  while the teaching of world history has largely replaced that of older courses  on Western Civilization at the undergraduate level.26 But while some world  history is still fairly fragmented, written from the perspective of an empiri- cally driven national history merely applied to non-Western states, several  world historians have sought to produce unifying narratives of global history  itself. Perhaps it should not be surprising that many of these world historians  who are interested in universal forms of history, like William H. McNeill and  J. R. McNeill, are some of the most outspoken proponents of big history.27  What is more, the Journal of World History has become an important venue for  the latest big history research and debates.  But even though world history is often global in scope, it has typically fol- lowed other subdisciplines of history in focusing on the era of the past that  is knowable chiefly by written records. World history is therefore still largely  in what Dan Smail calls the “chronogeographic grip” of an extremely narrow  past separated from the majority of humanity’s history by “the Neolithic  Rubicon,” essentially a paltry few thousand years that is truly minuscule  compared to the grand cosmic sweep claimed by big historians.28 177 HoP 4_2 text.indd   177 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="8"> The Story of Big History  World and big historians part company precisely in the use of extremely  large time scales, the accurate dating of which was enabled by the mid- twentieth century’s “chronometric revolution,” the second key develop- ment that made big history possible.29 The perfecting of carbon dating  techniques in particular has provided the big historian with more confi- dence to push the story of humanity into the deep past—into the eras of  the Earth’s history that have typically been the terrain of anthropology,  archaeology, biology, and geology. What is more, a range of cosmological  dating techniques has enabled precise dating to be applied to astronomical  time scales as well, thereby making it possible to map out the entire history  of the universe.30 “Suddenly,” according to Christian, “we can do prehistory,  paleontology, geology, and even cosmology with the sort of chronometric  precision previously confined to the study of human civilizations.”31 It is  now possible to see not only the history of recent human history but in  fact the history of all of humanity including that of the solar system and  even the universe itself accurately displayed in the form of the historian’s  best friend: the timeline.  The third, and perhaps most important historical development often  invoked to explain the emergence of big history, is that the sciences them- selves have become less mechanistic and more organic, embracing a certain  amount of chaos while at the same time becoming more historical in nature.  What is more, in the last century three key scientific paradigms have been  established helping at once to bridge the gaps between the various sciences  while presenting complementary histories of their subject matters.32 The  establishment of the Big Bang theory for astronomy and the history of the  universe; plate tectonics, and perhaps also the Gaia hypothesis for geology  and the history of the Earth; and natural selection for the evolution and his- tory of life have made it possible to tell a cohesive, universal, and scientific  history of the universe and the life within it.  What we are missing is a paradigm for human history. This is the main  contribution that big historians have sought to make by bringing the seem- ingly chaotic but comparatively short history of humanity into this scien- tific metanarrative structure by establishing a complementary paradigm  and thereby uniting both history and science under a grand unifying theory  and narrative.33 Whether any of the three approaches—Spier’s “Goldilocks  circumstances,” Eric Chaisson’s “energy flows,” and Christian’s “collective  178 HoP 4_2 text.indd   178 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="9"> History  of the Present learning”—or some combination of the three actually achieve this goal is  perhaps a debate best left for big history conferences. The point worth stress- ing here is simply that big historians truly hope “that ideas like these may  contain in embryo a Kuhnian paradigm for human history” because doing  so will finally “collapse the barriers that have divided the humanities from  the natural sciences for so long.”34  Given the interdisciplinarity of big history as well as its basis in the find- ings of modern science, practitioners do not feel the need to trace much of  a genealogy in describing their family history. Christian is quite emphatic  that big history has only been possible with the aforementioned “second  chronometric revolution,” so even H. G. Wells’s The Outline of History (1919),  which establishes human history within the context of the origins of the  Earth and the universe, is simply far too speculative and therefore unable  to achieve the threshold of scientific knowledge that is demanded of big  history, particularly when it comes to dating. The first real big history was  written by Erich Jantsch and called The Self-Organizing Universe. A synthesis  of recent advances in science, the book uncovers “an emergent unifying  paradigm which sheds unexpected light on the all-embracing phenomenon  of evolution,” thereby uniting what the author calls “macro-” and “micro- evolution,” ranging from the grand scheme of the cosmos to the small scale  of life on Earth.35 The other key text for big historians is the work of the U.S.  astrophysicist Eric Chaisson, whose Cosmic Evolution established much of  big history’s theoretical framework such as the notion of cosmic history  being the story of increasing complexity despite the second law of thermo- dynamics, a process which is achieved via the ability of organisms to handle  increasingly dense energy flows.36  Spier is a bit more lenient than Christian when it comes to assigning disci- plinary forebears. Though his view of disciplinary history as one of “heroes”  and “victims” is not terribly nuanced, and unfortunately seems to be nothing  more than a series of brief biographical sketches,37 Spier is certainly on to  something by searching for at least the modern origins of big history in the  Victorian period, precisely at the moment when deep time scales of geology  and biology were being established and popularized within the framework of  grand evolutionary histories, most notably by science writers such as Robert  Chambers.38 While there is surely an interesting analysis to be made about  the Victorian origins of big history, what is relevant here is the surprising  179 HoP 4_2 text.indd   179 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="10"> The Story of Big History absence from both Spier’s and Christian’s historiographical discussions  about the development of big history as a genre.39  As would be expected, however, big historians do assign tremendous im- portance to the story itself, a story that is in theory supposed to make sense  to all of humanity because of its truly universal nature. Brown refers to her  Big History as a “scientific creation story,” one that weaves “many disciplines  of human knowledge together in a single, seamless narrative.”40 Similarly,  Spier argues in response to a question from his wife about “why big history  happened the way it did,” that he realized “the answer might be both simple  and elegant.”41 The result is his own big history that explains “the origins of  everything from a scientific point of view.”42 Spier continues: “[E]very known  society has told stories about how they themselves and everything around  them came into being. From an academic point of view, such narratives are  now considered origin myths.”43 Here Spier is repeating a central rhetorical  feature of the big history story that is mobilized by Christian as well.  In his Maps of Time, Christian argues that the narrative produced by his  big history is best understood as a “modern creation myth,” what he calls a  “coherent account of how we were created and how we fit into the scheme of  things.”44 The use of the term myth is initially jarring, particularly given the  general scientific approach that is being promoted. A reader could certainly  be forgiven for assuming that Christian has accepted the conflation of his- tory with myth that was one of the hallmarks first of structuralism, and then  of post-structuralism and its attendant linguistic turn in the late twentieth  century. There is certainly no irony or playfulness implied in Christian’s  use of the term, unlike that found, for example, in Claude Lévi-Strauss’s  argument that “a clairvoyant history should admit that it never completely  escapes from the nature of myth.”45 It would be a mistake to think that big  history is somehow clairvoyant, however, or that it accepts the kind of epis- temological modesty that is implied by Lévi-Strauss, who famously sought  to write a “myth of mythology.”46 Big history may be a myth of origins, but  that terminology is not invoked to condition its truth claims, or to suggest  that there is something inherently fictional about the big history narrative.  Christian is, therefore, not suggesting that history is essentially myth, or  further that historians ought to accept history’s mythical, that is to say fic- tional, nature, but something quite the opposite. He argues that historically,  myths have provided a kind of deep meaning for societies to come to terms  with some of the most fundamental questions of existence, questions that  180 HoP 4_2 text.indd   180 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="11"> History  of the Present historians are not typically in the business of asking much less answering.  “Creation myths are powerful[,]” argues Christian, “because they speak to  our deep spiritual, psychic, and social need for a sense of place and a sense  of belonging.”47  As a “modern creation myth,” big history is seeking to become more inher- ently valuable than history proper, by fulfilling “our deep spiritual, psychic,  and social need” that only a grand narrative explaining our place in this  existence can achieve.48 In other words, big history is not just a scientific  account of universal origins; it is also a secular mythology that intends to  restore the continuity and harmony between the individual and the universe.  Christian argues that in a modern world so well defined by Émile Durkheim’s  concept of anomie, which describes the sense of fragmentation and loss of  values and meaning that seem to result from a secularized and technologi- cally sophisticated society with fleeting and anonymous social relations,  the task of big history should be to remythologize science in order to help  construct some of the meaning that has been lost.49 By doing so, he con- tinues, “history could play as significant a role in modern industrial society  as traditional creation myths have played in nonindustrial societies; but it  will do so only if it asks questions as large and as profound as those posed  in traditional creation myths.”50 Emplotting the Evolutionary Epic Even though Christian gives no suggestion about where his project of estab- lishing a specifically “modern creation myth” derives, the notion of remy- thologizing science is an implicit rhetorical move of much popular science  literature that is most clearly witnessed in its “readiness to leap from limited,  local observations and findings to cosmic wisdom.”51 This readiness to go  beyond what is suggested by the empirical facts—in order to discern some  deeper meaning that will typically transform human self-understanding— connects a seemingly diverse array of works dealing with any and all aspects  of science. Indeed, works of popular science are united by a remarkably  similar form, a style that typically begins with a very excited scientific sage  wanting to share his exploration of a wonderful subject that will inevitably  overturn some previously common misperception while uniting the various  branches of science. Such books seek something closer to revelation than to  enlightenment. Big history has much in common with this genre of literature,  as Christian’s TED talk should make clear. There is even a subgenre within  181 HoP 4_2 text.indd   181 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="12"> The Story of Big History this literature that seeks to do exactly that proposed by big history: unite  all of the sciences through an evolutionary story of truly epic and mythic  proportions.  Running in parallel to the modern self-disciplinary genealogy constructed  by big historians is a much larger genealogy of popular science writers in- cluding, in chronological order of their publications: Edward Wilson, Brian  Swimme and Thomas Berry, Connie Barlow, Russ Genet, Ursula Goode- nough, Loyal Rue, and most recently Mary Evelyn Tucker, to name just a few  of the key authors who, taken together, form a subgenre of popular science  writers invested in the evolutionary epic. The physicist and philosopher of  science Martin Eger discerned the makings of this genre, which he termed  the “new epic of science,” in a 1993 article about a series of science books  written throughout the 1970s and early 1980s.52 He examined works written  in a variety of scientific disciplines including prebiotic evolution, cosmic  evolution, sociobiology, and the work of brain psychologists and artificial  intelligence research and argued that there was an astonishing similarity  in both the content and form of this diverse literature, to the point where it  seemed as if each author was contributing parts to the same larger story of  science. And the story of science that was produced tended to be both moral  and aesthetic: moral in the sense that the authors were calling attention to  the deeper meanings of scientific advances that would bear on human self- understanding; and aesthetic in the sense that what was being promoted was  a universal story of science, one united by an extended theory of evolution  able to reconcile science with human experience.  The works of this genre typically begin with a philosophical survey of a  general problem related to some aspect of science; that science is then de- scribed throughout the main part of the book; and then the work ends with a  return to the original philosophical problem, which has now been solved on  the basis of the previously presented scientific discussion. The philosophical  problem initially invoked is typically that of so-called “two cultures” divide  between the sciences and the humanities, a division that is discussed very  seriously as the author’s task to unify. The middle portion of the work varies  from discipline to discipline, but what is constant is the “flagrant excite- ment” that what is being discussed is based on recent discoveries “that have  made it possible to treat such philosophical and social subjects scientifically,  and the eagerness of the authors to spread these insights beyond their own  specialized community. . . . In general terms, of course, such developments  182 HoP 4_2 text.indd   182 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="13"> History  of the Present are widely known, but these authors see similar things happening not just  in molecular biology and astronomy but throughout the sciences; and the  cumulative effect causes the exhilaration.”53 The final philosophical conclu- sion “includes unabashed calls for a new morality or a new ‘vision’ of the world,”  a claim that is apparently authoritative because it is built on the scientific  foundation that has already been established.54  The archetype of the genre is Edward O. Wilson’s On Human Nature, which  seeks to explain the evolution of human nature from a sociobiological per- spective. Wilson opens his discussion by proposing a “blending of biology  and the social sciences” and continues that “as a consequence the two cul- tures of Western intellectual life will be joined at last.”55 The main part of  his book describes the various ways in which a biologically informed social  science can come to understand the relationship between natural selection,  genetic inheritance, and the social environment within the larger context of  human evolution. The closing discussion of the book examines the centrality  of religions in all human societies from within a sociobiological framework.   Citing Durkheim throughout, Wilson determines not only that religious  belief is “an ineradicable part of human nature,” but also that it serves an  important evolutionary function by congealing an individual and group iden- tity.56 “In the midst of the chaotic and potentially disorienting experiences  each person undergoes daily,” Wilson argues, “religion classifies him, provides  him with unquestioned membership in a group claiming great powers, and  by this means gives him a driving purpose in life compatible with his self- interest.”57 For Wilson, the role of myth is particularly central given that it is  through mythological narratives that “the tribe’s special place in the world  is explained in rational terms consistent with the listener’s understanding  of the physical world.”58 And it is mythology, according to Wilson, that still  rules human beings in a profoundly important way. It is therefore the task of  science to take advantage of that mythopoeic drive in human nature in order  to establish a new relationship between humanity and nature.  The purpose of On Human Nature is not to provide a scientific justification  for religious belief but rather to explain its evolutionary function that has  served the human species well as a survival strategy. It is for this reason that  Wilson’s sociobiology does not seek to eradicate religious myth but to replace  it with a secular myth of equal power and significance. “Make no mistake  about the power of scientific materialism,” argues Wilson. “It presents the  human mind with an alternative mythology that until now has always point  183 HoP 4_2 text.indd   183 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="14"> The Story of Big History for point in zones of conflict, defeated traditional religion. Its narrative form  is the epic, the evolution of the universe from the big bang.”59 It is by writing  a truly evolutionary epic, Wilson explains, made possible by the uniting of  the social sciences and biology within a sociobiological framework, that  the “power of religion” will be diverted “into the services” of science and by  extension enable further evolutionary progress.60  If Wilson announces the need for an evolutionary epic in the late 1970s, it  is clear, according to Eger, that he is referring to a series of scientific studies  that would contribute to the epic rather than present it wholesale; the epic  was simply far too vast to be contained in one narrative.61 The notion was  a big-picture idea that could be pieced together from just a few key sources  from within the epic of science genre: “From Darwin’s original theory, the  lines of extension radiate downward to prebiotic (chemical) evolution as  expounded by [Ilya] Prigogine and [Isabelle] Eigen; to cosmic evolution as  described by [Steven] Weinberg, Paul Davies and the astrophysicists; to hu- man culture as Wilson explains in his theories of sociobiology; and finally,  through the work of brain physiologists and AI researchers, to consciousness  itself.”62 Throughout the 1990s and 2000s it was precisely this big picture  that emerged in the form of individual metanarratives written to tell the  entire story of humanity within the context of the universe, albeit from the  perspective of an author’s particular area of expertise. What was produced  was just the evolutionary epic Wilson envisioned, an epic that would seek  “to reanimate the deep emotions that are innate to the human mind.”63  Interestingly, the form of the previous incarnation of the evolutionary  epic remains the same in its general framework, but for the most part the  philosophy and the science itself becomes universal. While the philosophy  typically still involves uniting the two cultures so that humanity can more  properly come to terms with its current state of secular disconnect with  itself and the universe more broadly, the central science that establishes the  evidence for these philosophical claims is presented within the framework of  a historical narrative. That narrative, moreover, is emplotted almost identi- cally along the lines that we have already seen with big history: it begins with  the origins of the universe in the big bang; moves through the origins of the  solar system and the Earth; describes the origins and evolution of life; and  culminates in the story of humanity. With little deviation aside from some of  the details, the story is often described as some variant of a secular creation  myth.64 Moreover, the reader is now directly invoked as an active participant  184 HoP 4_2 text.indd   184 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="15"> History  of the Present in the story itself through a reinforcement of one’s personal connections to  the story.  Connie Barlow has been one of the foremost proponents of this newer  version of the evolutionary epic and has argued, perhaps more explicitly  than Wilson, for the “sacred” nature of the story that must be told, in or- der to make explicit that personal connection.65 Following Wilson, Barlow  argues that there is a clear “mythopoeic drive, a sense of the sacred,” that  is absolutely central to past and current societies, to the point where such  beliefs are “likely to have a strong genetic component.”66 Rather than trying  to root out such genetic dispositions, Barlow suggests “that we satisfy the  innate longing for religious grounding with a cultural explanation derived  from science.”67 And, of course, that scientific explanation needs to be the  story of evolution, from the origin of the universe to the present human  circumstances. “By way of the evolutionary epic,” argues Barlow, “we can  redesign our prescriptions for spiritual allurement and atonement, and we  can revisit questions of ultimate meaning and value.”68 That is because the  evolutionary epic is “the creation story of our time,” a story that connects  every single person not to “the triumphant march of humankind” but to “the  even grander story of the evolutionary stream of life, of planet Earth, and of  the universe.”69  Barlow is, in particular, a great admirer of Brian Swimme and Thomas  Berry’s The Universe Story, which is one of the first metanarratives published  of the full-blown evolutionary epic genre. In it we find many of the same  tropes typical of the earlier version of the genre—the excitement for the as- similation and unification of new data, the desire to heal the two solitudes,  the possibility of a new morality being engendered by their study. But as  the title suggests, Swimme and Berry are not interested in simply discuss- ing the findings of a single science but rather in telling “the story of the  universe,” which “has been told in many ways by many different peoples of  the Earth.”70 For Swimme and Berry, the story of the universe functions in  exactly the same way as Wilson’s myth: it provides identity, belonging, and  “the basis of social authority.”71 It is precisely such a story that, they argue, is  lacking in the modern period, and that Swimme and Berry seek to provide.  They are truly enthusiastic about the “new type of narrative . . . that has only  recently begun to find expression” in the assimilation and organization of  an “immense amount of data that we now have before us. . . . We are now  experiencing that exciting moment when our new meaning, our new story is  185 HoP 4_2 text.indd   185 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="16"> The Story of Big History taking shape.”72 This is our story, as Swimme and Berry present themselves  not as authors but as fellow readers of the collective story told in the book’s  pages: “The goal is not to read a book; the goal is to read the story taking  place all around us.”73  Swimme and Berry begin their evolutionary epic with the “Primordial  Flaring Forth,” a term they prefer to the big bang. “All that exists in the uni- verse traces back to this exotic, ungraspable seed event,” write Swimme  and Berry, “a microcosmic grain, a reality layered with the power to fling  a hundred billion galaxies through vast chasms in a flight that has lasted  fifteen billion years.”74 Written in this awe-inspired language, The Universe  Story describes the establishment of galaxies, the sun and the solar system;  the beginning of life on Earth; the origin and evolution of the human species;  the “course of human affairs”; and concludes with a discussion of both the  immediate and distant future.  Typical of the full-blown evolutionary epic, the narrative does not end  with the present circumstances but rather at a point in the near future. In  the same way that medieval chronicles became historical narratives through  the introduction of moralizing conclusions, the evolutionary epic achieves  narrative closure through the act of moralizing under the guise of a predic- tion of possible future states, the outcome of which is largely dependent on  human action. This is essentially a call to action of everyday heroes to join  in the struggle to engender a viable ecological future. Wilson likens this kind  of conclusion to a Methodist altar call: “The altar call is that moment at the  end of the sermon when the pastor calls all believers who wish to declare  themselves for Jesus or to reaffirm their faith to do so by coming forward, to  the altar or to the prayer rail, while hymns are sung.”75 Building on the fact  that early on the reader becomes a part of the story and therefore has been  made to feel it and care deeply about it, the conclusion directs that feeling  towards a sense of urgency and therefore the necessity of some form of col- lective agency.76 The rest of the story becomes a moment of responsibility—a  place for the reader to come forward and co-create.  Swimme and Berry therefore conclude “our” Universe Story by describing  how their “account of the past provides a response to the present and guid- ance for the future.”77 They argue that their “mythic vision” of the universe  has made it clear that we have come to an end of the Cenozoic era in hu- man history—an era that has witnessed humans taking “extensive control  over the Earth process with little sensitivity to the more integral dynamics  186 HoP 4_2 text.indd   186 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="17"> History  of the Present of planetary affairs.”78 A new era will surely replace it, but Swimme and  Berry admit that it will be a struggle to bring about the necessary “period of  creativity” that will help “to remedy the devastation of the planet.”79 Should  “the entire Earth community” be mobilized to engender just such a period,  Swimme and Berry envision the creation of the “Ecozoic era,” an era that will  announce a radically new relationship between humans and the universe,  one underpinned by the simple acknowledgement that “the universe is a  communion of subjects rather than a collection of objects.”80  The Ecozoic era is only one possibility, however, as there is “a newly devel- oped mystique of our plundering industrial society [that] is committed to . . .  shaping an even more controlled order of things that might be designated as  the Technozoic era.”81 The arrival of the Technozoic era would be disastrous for  the human species, whose future seems to hinge entirely on the “awaken[ing  of] a consciousness of the sacred dimension of the Earth. For what is at stake  is not simply an economic resource, it is the meaning of existence itself.”82  Swimme and Berry call on the reader to find a place within this story and  to help bring about the Ecozoic era. “Each member of the Earth community  has its own proper role within the entire sequence of transformations that  have given shape and identity to everything that exists.”83  A host of science writers have followed the philosophical lead of Wilson  and Barlow; they have accepted the necessary task of producing a sacred  history and have written their own evolutionary epics based on the current  state of science as well as the mythopoeic template provided by Swimme  and Berry. By doing so, the authors have sought to provide some form of  holistic meaning in the present with the ultimate goal of directing the best  course of action and “life ways” for the sacred Earth and our species in  the future.84 There are also several websites devoted to sharing links and  educational material related to the cosmic story of evolution, including  Barlow’s own thegreatstory.org, as well as a few multimedia combinations  such as Nancy Ellen Abrams and Joel Primack’s The View from the Center  of the Universe and Brian Swimme and Mary Evelyn Tucker’s Journey of the  Universe.85 There have also been several conferences and subsequent edited  collections, most notably a collection of essays derived from a conference  on the evolutionary epic in Hawaii in 2008. It was attended for the most  part by scientists and popular science writers, though big historians David  Christian and Cynthia Stokes Brown also attended, publishing their talks  in the conference collection.86 187 HoP 4_2 text.indd   187 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="18"> The Story of Big History  This edited collection appears to be the first explicit indication that big  history was making a contribution to the evolutionary epic genre. Christian’s  participation was particularly welcomed at the conference as he was asked  to pen the foreword to the edited collection, selections of which were quoted  in epigraph form throughout the volume itself. In describing the conference,  Christian made it clear that there was little distinction between his proj- ect and that of the evolutionary epic: “The conference was about a story,”  Christian explained, “and it was the power, beauty, and the importance of  that story that drew the participants together. The story has many differ- ent names; Evolutionary Epic is just one. It has also been called a Modern  Creation Myth, The Universe Story, Big History.”87 In spite of the different  genre terms, argued Christian, the story itself is unchanged. “Whatever the  name, the core idea is the same: there is emerging today a coherent story,  based on modern, scientific information that tells the history of our universe,  from its very beginnings to today.”88 Discovering the Tropics of Big History What is striking about what brings all of these scholars, writers, scientists,  academics, and historians together in this common venture is that big history  is not really a subject matter that connects them to an era, or to a discipline  of knowledge, or even to a particular science. They are united instead by a  story, according to Christian—that is to say, by the story. Even more striking  is the shared nature of the literary conventions that tell this story, a story  that in theory could be emplotted in a variety of different ways. But why  must it be told as an epic as opposed to any of the other main modes of his- toriographical emplotment, such as romance, tragedy, comedy, or satire?89  For Wilson, this question puts the problem entirely backwards. The ques- tion should not be about why this history is emplotted one way rather than  another but, rather, about why we wish to see the evolutionary history of  the world as an epic. He argues that we want to see the history of the world  constructed in such a way precisely because such emplotment relates to “the  way the human mind has evolved to work. And that entails archetypes.”90  Wilson continues: “We have an urge to create transcendental narratives,  which justify human life on Earth, which justify our tribe, our nation, which  empower it by recounting heroic episodes of the kind that bound it together  and will bind it again, that will meet any crisis. The adaptive significance of  the propensity toward archetypes, epics, is clear.”91 188 HoP 4_2 text.indd   188 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="19"> History  of the Present  On the one hand, Wilson accepts the fact that the epic is simply a familiar  mode of writing, a literary archetype that the reader will recognize and un- derstand. On the other hand, Wilson seems to believe that the human mind  has evolved in such a way as to accept the social and political necessities and  consequences that are implied in a given epic, thereby recognizing the epic  form as reality itself. But rather than exposing the “realistic effect” of such  narrative discourse, which would be the strategy of someone like Hayden  White, in the hope that it would invite historians to be more explicit about  their narrative choices vis-à-vis the contingent and necessarily incom- plete historical record, Wilson seems to want to use the often hidden liter- ary dimension of history to serve his larger ecological and sociobiological  agenda.92 A similar tension can be found in the work of big history where the  explicitly mythological nature of the story competes with the dire political  and social consequences that supposedly arise from the story itself.  Even though big historians will often describe their anthropocentric grand  narratives as merely provisional and therefore likely to change and evolve as  our scientific knowledge progresses, they still write as if the big history story  is one that exists independent of their narration of it, thereby embracing  rather than exposing the ultimate reality effect of their discourse.93 This is  most clear in the prefaces and introductions to their works where big histo- rians, following a genre convention of the evolutionary epic, describe their  personal discoveries of the grand story that their books will retell. While this  is done to indicate just how this cosmic and universal story functions on an  individual level, it also has the effect of reifying the story itself. The reader  is made to feel included in the story through the author, who describes a  discovery of and personal connection to the grand evolutionary story that  is told in the book’s pages, a discovery that the reader is now also making.  Christian, Spier, and Brown each open their volumes by describing their  desire for a bigger story to teach to replace the specialized and routine facts  their students were previously forced to endure. Reminiscent of Victorian  autodidact Henry Thomas Buckle, who was dumbfounded by the seeming  refusal of English historians to develop laws of history despite having done  the specialized empirical work, Christian describes his utter frustration at  the unwillingness of his colleagues in the historical profession to generalize  beyond their own particular subjects.94 From this perspective, the emergence  of the story of big history is best understood as a tale of recovery—from the  grasp of specialized academics, who were in the business of chopping up  189 HoP 4_2 text.indd   189 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="20"> The Story of Big History information as if it were best understood in its “disconnected fragments,”  and who therefore contributed “to the pervasive quality of disorientation  of modern life.”95 Christian set out to counter this tendency towards “in- tellectual modesty” which he labeled as both “unnecessary and harmful”  by “assembl[ing]”—as opposed to making—this grand “modern creation  myth,” which first appeared as a series of lectures at Macquarie University  in Sydney, Australia.96  Fred Spier discovered big history when he found out about Christian’s  Macquarie course, which “provide[d] exactly the type of historical overview  that I had been trying to find.”97 Spier, who tends to conflate two very different  meanings of big history—a disciplinary approach as well as the anthropo- centric cosmic story that the discipline seeks to construct—argues that “big  history has become a wonderful way of explaining how both my own person  and everything around me have come into being.”98 Any question, accord- ing to Spier, “concerning how and why certain aspects of the present have  become the way they are,” can be answered by big history. And this inte- gration of “all the studies of the past into a novel and coherent perspective”  is precisely, for Spier, what separates big history from all other academic  disciplines, thereby helping to establish a “new and satisfying connect” be- tween the reader and the story itself.99 Such a connect is no doubt evidenced,  according to Spier, by big history’s growing student enrollments.100  Brown describes her interest in big history as a product of her family  history—specifically her mother, who was a middle school biology teach- er. “Thus, ‘big history’ is a natural way of thinking for me,” argues Brown.101  Brown’s preface reads like a brief autobiography as she describes not just the  influence of her mother, but also a passion for storytelling which she says  she inherited from her father: we hear about her growing up in Kentucky;  about her education and professional history; and about her eventual at- tempts to tell the story of human history from the perspective of the longue  durée, a story that she came to understand only through the act of telling it.  Describing her discovery of the theme of population increases, Brown writes  that it “emerged as I wrote the story rather than the other way around.”102  She continues: “This theme is what I noticed recurring as I tried to tell the  entire human story as compactly as I could without truncating it. . . . Only  the longer time frames reveal what humans have wrought; I was partially,  but not fully, aware of it until my story was told.”103 It is as if the themes of  190 HoP 4_2 text.indd   190 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="21"> History  of the Present big history are just waiting for us to discover them, themes that will reveal  themselves in the very act of storytelling.  In making this story part of a personal discovery, the authors as tellers  have made the connection between the individual and the cosmic, between  the author as reader and the story of the universe itself. But for this story to  gain meaning beyond being a mere chronology of evolutionary events and  therefore achieve the status of a creation myth requires an act of narrative  closure. As if following a template not chosen by them, big historians con- clude their works through an analysis of possible futures, a rendering that  is every bit as moralistic as that found in the evolutionary epics from which  the form derives.  Spier’s Big History and the Future of Humanity, as the title suggests, is guided  by a concern for the future, and his big history achieves narrative closure  through an act of predicting what may come. He admits in the preface to his  work that in the 1970s he became worried about “environmental problems,”  citing in particular the Club of Rome’s 1972 report The Limits to Growth, which  predicted dire consequences for human well-being given current rates of  population and industrial growth in comparison to the limited supply of  natural resources and continuing environmental degradation.104 Concerned  with “how humanity had gotten itself into this situation,” Spier returns to this  theme in his final chapter entitled “Facing the Future” where he describes the  challenges confronting humanity’s immediate future given the problem of  energy supply. In writing this way, he connects the general theory of “energy  flows” that structures his narrative to that of a present and future concern:  “This [available energy], and only this, will determine whether humanity will  be able to shape sufficient amounts of constructed complexity and sustain  Goldilocks circumstances to help it survive on this planet.”105 This is a reality,  Spier explains, that humans must embrace urgently in order to devise some  real solutions. To this problem he wonders if culture might help—to “tame  both our biological instincts and social arrangements.” Spier hopes that by  “contributing to a reunion of the natural and social sciences,” his own big  history will help provide just the cultural aid necessary “to clarify the major  issues that humanity will have to face in the near future.”106  Brown’s Big History also includes a final chapter on the present and future,  “What Now? What Next?” In claiming that she has “not been limited up  to now by what historians usually do,” a familiar rhetorical strategy of big  191 HoP 4_2 text.indd   191 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="22"> The Story of Big History historians, Brown describes the present situation in order to “plan for the  future.”107 Along with Spier, Brown cites the Club of Rome’s report, stating  that it asks the right question about the limits of the Earth’s carrying capacity.  Brown suggests that perhaps those limits have been reached, an argument  supported by the thirty-year update to The Limits to Growth, which found that  its dire predictions were unfortunately on target, that “the ‘human footprint’  outstripped the carrying capacity of the Earth in the 1980s.”108  Should such trends of unlimited growth continue, the authors predict out- put levels peaking quite soon and then suddenly dropping to pre-twentieth  century levels, leading to a dire future existence, the likes of which would  be impossible to imagine. Brown, along with the authors of The Limits to  Growth, holds out hope that the global community could mobilize to thwart  the current trends by cooperating in “unprecedented ways to meet the un- precedented threat.”109 While this may seem unlikely, Brown’s story has  shown that humans have evolved in such a way “that we seem to hold the  immediate future of Earth in our hands.”110  In the final chapter of Maps of Time, Christian also does not shy away from  predicting what will come even though he, much like Brown, confesses that  such speculation goes against traditional historiographical practice. Inter- estingly, Christian admits that the distant future is much easier to predict  given that the sudden spikes that occupy the framework of shorter time scales  tend to level out over the long run, a process that will ultimately witness the  end of life on Earth with the inevitable burning out of the sun. But what wor- ries Christian more is the unpredictability of the next few generations, with  a quality of life that will be determined by how humans confront the current  environmental transformations that are a direct result of accelerating hu- man activity and development. It becomes clear at this point that Christian’s  universe story has culminated with a final threshold moment that observes  humans evolving to the point where we can now choose either to direct or  be directed by nature. “We must learn to step outside the modern creation  story,” Christian writes, “and accept that we are the collective authors of its  next chapter.”111  This message is made more forcefully in Christian’s TED talk where he  takes his audience on a “return journey of 13.7 billion years” to tell them “a  powerful story . . . in which humans play an astonishing and creative role.  But it also contains warnings.”112 Christian relates his continuing concerns  about a possible nuclear holocaust as well as the very real danger to life on  192 HoP 4_2 text.indd   192 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="23"> History  of the Present the planet posed by human-induced climate change. The process of “col- lective learning is a very, very powerful force,” argues Christian, and while  such learning has enabled humans to be in a special position of astonishing  power, it’s not entirely clear if “humans are in charge of it.”113 But Christian  believes that the “story of big history” could guide the future of humanity, by  showing “us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that  face us.”114 Clearly he believes that should big history become our “modern  creation myth,” a story that is known by heart, humans will have the right  world picture that will guide them in facing the “challenges” and “opportuni- ties” of the future.115  At the end of his TED talk, in place of the various images that were used to  illustrate the history of the cosmos, pictures of Christian with his grandson  appear, and Christian rather abruptly explains what he wants from big his- tory: “This is what I want. I want my grandson, Daniel, and his friends, and  his generation throughout the world to know the story of big history, and to  know it so well that they understand both the challenges that face us and the  opportunities that face us.”116 Christian’s TED talk is a wonderful illustration  of the very clear moral framework that is driving the big history narrative. It  also illustrates the fact that the moral does not appear in any way inherent  to the scientific facts that are presented throughout but is rather imposed  to achieve narrative closure for an epic that would otherwise have to end  with the inevitability of heat death, an ending that would perhaps be just  as alienating and meaningless as the fragmented and specialized histories  that big history seeks to replace. Conclusion: Big History as Earthrise History There seems to be a general assumption made by practitioners and sup- porters of big history that because what is being told is an anthropocentric  story of cosmic origins, that such a story will necessarily have deep meaning  that will engender some sort of unification with our micro and macro exis- tences. The problem with this assumption, however, is that there is nothing  inherently meaningful about what the science tells us in this story. This is  ultimately what David Armitage means when he says that “big history, in all  its guises, has been inhospitable to the questions of meaning and intention  so central to intellectual history.”117 Supporters of big history will respond  that dealing with such large questions of origin is inherently meaningful,  but such meaning only becomes clear in the futuristic conclusions, which  193 HoP 4_2 text.indd   193 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="24"> The Story of Big History seem to contradict what Armitage calls the “essential materialism” of the  big history story.118  As Christian makes clear in his TED talk, the law that governs this entire  story is the law of entropy, a law that states that in the long run “the general  tendency of the universe is to move from order and structure to lack of order,  lack of structure, in fact to mush.”119 The fact that within that general trend  of entropy humans are shown by big historians to be governed initially by  biological, geological, and then economistic forces far outside their inten- tional control does not lend terribly well to the deep mythological meaning  Christian has in mind. And yet, when we come to the end of these evolu- tionary epics, the most profound reversal awaits us in the form of a new  “threshold moment,” a moment of immense possibility where humans have  finally evolved to the point where we almost “seem to share a single brain”  and must surely now be able to shape our own “Goldilocks conditions” for  a lengthy future existence if only we follow the right path.120  These sorts of conclusions that we have seen with big history and the  evolutionary epic, where the overall trend of the story seems to reverse itself  in the end, contain variations on a convention that is central to all contem- porary popular science writing known as the compensatory principle. “It  is a near constant of science writing,” argues Gregory Schrempp, “to offer  a compensatory vision for the one that we are asked to give up.”121 Indeed,  science writers often like to highlight the lack of agency and significance of  humanity from the perspective of an awe-inspiring and powerful natural  world picture that has continuously registered blows to anthropocentrism.  From Copernicus to Darwin to Freud, as the story goes, the human species  has been continually decentered, suggesting an insignificance in regard to  humanity and perhaps even a meaninglessness from a scientific perspective.  This view is seemingly often embraced throughout works of popular science  only to be reversed in the conclusions where new meaning is found in the  face of apparent meaninglessness, where human agency is found despite  its previous insignificance, where Earth is found suddenly to occupy, once  again, the center of the universe.  This is perhaps most clear with the science literature surrounding the  1968 Apollo 8 mission, which took the famous Earthrise images from the  perspective of the Moon.122 This was supposed to be the moment when hu- manity would, for the first time, see the Earth for what it is—simply another  194 HoP 4_2 text.indd   194 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="25"> History  of the Present planet symbolically isolated in the grand expanse of space, the first actual  visualization of the Copernican heliocentric system. The response from  the Earthrise image, in particular, was anything but a final realization of  the Copernican Revolution. It was, in fact, a counterrevolution. The Earth  looked more beautiful than could have possibly been imagined, appearing  very much alive in its magnificent blue hue in stunning contrast with the  grey moon that appeared in the foreground.  What is more, the images were initially mediated by the commentary of  the astronauts, who beamed a Christmas Eve message back to Earth as they  orbited the Moon, which included a reading by each astronaut of passages  from the biblical creation story of Genesis.123 It would be difficult to find a  more symbolic rejection of the Copernican universe. And this was a view  that was widely shared in the science literature of the time.124 “The view  that the cosmic adventurers brought became a mythic presence,” argues  Schrempp, “a spontaneous, powerful, collective, cosmic vision transcend- ing any one author or moment in time and elaborated in spiraling variation  around an indelible core.”125 It was apparently a sacred moment that gave  impetus to James Lovelock’s Gaia hypothesis, while radically altering Fred  Spier’s “perspective of Earth beyond recognition,” eventually leading to his  own cosmic view of human history.126 Hans Blumenberg’s response was  particularly suggestive, arguing that the Apollo mission “brought to an end  the Copernican trauma of the Earth’s having the status of a mere point—of  the annihilation of its importance by the enormity of the universe.”127  The compensatory principle that is so clearly at work in the Copernican  counterrevolutionary responses to the Apollo 8 mission is also apparent in the  work of big history. All of the big history accounts relish describing just how  relatively short life on Earth is in comparison to that of the universe. Moreover,  the space occupied by the Earth is similarly shocking when set against an ever- expanding universe filled with billions of galaxies each containing billions of  stars and other solar systems just like our own. What is more, human history  is made to appear relatively insignificant when set against the entire history of  life on Earth, which has endured massive changes in its environment, including  periods of mass extinction. And yet, despite this almost constant decentering,  by the end of the story of big history, one cannot help but believe that humans  are special, an evolutionary miracle the result of an almost impossible set of  Goldilocks conditions that we now find ourselves in a position to destroy or  195 HoP 4_2 text.indd   195 9/26/14   8:30 AM </page> <page sequence="26"> The Story of Big History perhaps reshape to ensure our survival. As Brown argues, “our significance as  humans increases rather than decreases against the scale of the universe.”128  Indeed, while the story of big history shows time and again that humans are  at the mercy of biological, environmental, economistic, and societal forces, in  our current threshold moment we’ve somehow managed to break free of these  constraints. If only we could truly understand our place within the context of  contexts—know the story of big history so well that we would be able to make  the right decisions in the future. Paradise may be lost, but with the help of big  history it may also be regained.  Big historians seem to think that by accepting the mythological nature of  their endeavor to write a grand cosmic sweep of scientific origins, they will  be establishing deep meanings that are themselves based on what the sci- ence tells us happened. But myth, it is important to recognize, only becomes  meaningful through its “projections of local frames of understanding and  practice.”129 As Schrempp makes clear, “whatever its professed object, the  ‘real’ object of mythico-religious cosmological discourse is humans and  their inner-worldly concerns.”130 Indeed, like any myth, big history’s deep  meanings are not inherently derived from empirical observations but from its  anthropomorphic projections of an idealized cosmic world. As Stephen Jay  Gould argued in Full House, “We reveal ourselves in the metaphors we choose  for depicting the cosmos in miniature.”131 The idealized world of big history  is one where humans are the special subject of a grand evolutionary epic,  where they have ultimate agency over their evolutionary future, and where  what is necessary in overcoming the challenges of the present and future is  the knowledge of that story. To Hayden White’s insight that “nothing and  no one lives a story,” Christian would respond that humans have evolved to  the point where they can in fact live a story.132 And that story is big history.

On the specific issue of big history as a science see David Christian, “Bridging  the Two Cultures: History, Big History, and Science,” Historical Speaking (May–June  2005): 21–26.  8.

See Dipesh Chakrabarty, “The Climate of History:  Four Theses,” Critical Inquiry 35 (Winter 2009): 197–222, for a seemingly similar though  ultimately more nuanced historiographical response to our current environmental  crisis. Chakrabarty argues, much like big historians such as Christian and other authors  of the evolutionary epic, that the writing of history must now take into account a much  broader expanse of time and space given that humans have essentially become geologi- cal actors in the era of the Anthropocene. But unlike Christian, Chakrabarty argues  that this new historical understanding that has been demanded by a shared sense of  impending catastrophe cannot simply appeal to older forms of universal history while  subsuming the particularities of the past. He proposes writing instead a “negative  universal history,” a much more self-critical narrative form that would attend to both  the universal and the particular. The concept “negative universal history” is further  explored in Antonio Y. Vázquez-Arroyo, “Universal History Disavowed: On Critical  Theory and Postcolonialism,” Postcolonial Studies 11:4 (2008): 451–473.  112. Christian, “The History of Our World in 18 Minutes.”  113.

Even Carl Sagan’s Pale Blue  Dot (1994), which set out to counter exactly the pre-Copernican worldview on offer  by the post-Earthrise science literature, could not help but offer a compensatory  principle by making earth the center of a cosmic diaspora of space exploration.
