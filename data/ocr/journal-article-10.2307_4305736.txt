<plain_text><page sequence="1">MACHINE ANIMISAI IN MODERN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE H. JOSEPH SCHWARCZ INANIMATE OBJECTS AS PROTAGO- NISTS-HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN TITERATURE of all times and of all peoples has always known and , told of man-made objects that took on a magic quality and served their owners in miraculous ways. But inanimate objects as protagonists of tales can be found, before the latter half of the nineteenth century, only very rarely. In order to be the hero of a tale, the object has to undergo a process of animation; it is shaped by technological processes so as to be use- ful to man, is perceived as an entity, and is endowed with "life"; the leap fan- tasy has to take is much greater than in the anthropomorphization of talking beasts. A few examples can be adduced. The old Caucasian (the term being used in its geographical, not its racial, sense) motif of "The kitchen utensils' rebellion against man" tells of excited pots and pans, etc., that will not stand their servitude any more, but the good house- wife finds a way to pacify them. In one version of "The Pot," a Danish folk tale,' the story's hero is a pot that wanders from one home to another in the village and endeavors to bring food to the poor. The pot speaks, and replies when spoken to; it shows understand- ing. Yet its owner received it from the hands of a good witch, and it is at her command that he has taken up the task of going from door to door looking for the deserving poor. In another ver- sion of the same tale,2 it is in a poor man's possession and "skips" to more fortunate homes and farms and steals food, grain, and money for its owner; it talks and acts independently and re- sponds to questions. It was given to its owner by "a fine-faced stranger." The tale bears social significance: it is a kind of Robin Hood pot, but of defi- nitely magical origin. In Goethe's "Wandering Bell,"3 the church bell leaves its steeple and har- asses the child who refuses to come to church for Sunday prayers. Yet the child has been forewarned by his mother that this might finally happen; the bell therefore appears to have been sent by some higher power. The common characteristics of the objects in the tales cited seem to be that, though personified, they appear in stories that are actually parables and that man's superiority is not questioned. And, as has been mentioned, the ex- amples are relatively rare. All this was changed by the appear- ance of the first writer of modern fan- tasy, Hans Christian Andersen. His unusually sensitive mind discovered life in everyone and everything; what- ever his fantasy touched upon became for him the bearer of a destiny, the l"Der Topf" (Danemark), Eutropdische Volks- marchen, ausgewalt von Max Luthy (Zurich: Manesse: Bibliothek der Weltliteratur, 1951 ), pp. 51-57. 2 "The Talking Pot," Thirteen Danish Tales, re- told by Mary C.

Andersen's animation of man-made objects manifests itself in various ways. Some of the stories are frankly alle- gorical. "The Shirt Collar,"4 a would-be Don Juan, conducts unhappy love af- fairs with several female objects-the garter, the hot iron, a scissors, and a comb. When he gets old, he-like Casa- nova before him-retells his adventures in a form embellished by his memory. But other tales create a more emotional atmosphere, calling upon the reader's feelings just as if their heroes were hu- man or animal. "The Old Street Lamp" becomes more and more human as the story develops, and in the end he feels that the old couple whose rooms he brightens are fond of him for his own sake: "I'm really like a child to them." In "The Old House,"6 one of Andersen's most tranquil and original tales, the old house, the new houses, the little boy, the flowers, the old man, the birds, the brass knobs on the railings, the carved trumpeter, and the tin soldier curiously live side by side in "one world" and even a scrap of pigskin covering "has something to say." One could only with difficulty determine who really is the hero of this story: None of them really stands out, and the general mood, of life passing away from all of us, serves as the great equalizer in this story. And yet Andersen's animated man- made objects inhabit a strange land. They are alive, so it seems; they are personified and equipped with human attributes; they are conscious of their existence; they contemplate their ex- periences and become wiser for doing so; they are very sensitive creatures. On the other hand, though, they are wrong in assuming that they are im- portant to man; they are alive, but they are so much wrapped up in their nar- cissistic memories that they never real- ize that they are not free to act; they strive for independence but fail to at- tain it. Their existence is, from man's point of view, a tragic and ridiculous illusion-yet again, they are alive enough to lead their illusory existence. Behind it we can discern Andersen's existentialist view of human life. Man uses his tools and prides himself on them as long as they are new and fit his purposes. As they become dented and cracked they become worthless, and we throw them away. Some of the wiser among the objects are aware that this is so. The "Tea-Pot"7 gains more insight into the conditions of existence in this world than any other object. She knows, in spite of her pride in herself, that she is in fact much less important than she would have us believe. As this deeply symbolic tale develops, the suffering tea-pot slowly perceives something of elementary importance-the superiority of organic substance over the inorganic. In the hour of her humiliation: "Even as I stood there, my better life began: you are one thing, and then you become something quite different.... Earth was put inside me and for a tea-pot that's as much as being buried . . . in the earth a bulb was planted . . . the bulb lay in the earth, the bulb lay inside me." And the tea-pot begins to believe 'Han Christian Andersen, H. C. Andersen's Fairy Tales, trans. L. W. Kingsland (New York: Henry Z. Walck, Inc., 1962), pp. 309-12.

The tea-pot is thrown out into the yard; yet even there she is forever ennobled by her illusory ex- perience of organic wholeness and preg- nancy. In "The Nightingale,"9 Ander- sen states even more unequivocally that the living animal is superior to the arti- fact. It is intriguing to speculate on what drove Andersen to preoccupy himself so much with the fictional character and essence of objects. The same forces that brought about his character and nourished his imagination possibly also strengthened this aspect of his mind. The "pan-animation" found in Ander- sen's work may be explained as a reac- tion to, or a projection of, the perpetual excitement and the abnormally high, almost paranoid, level of fantasy that existed in his childhood environment. His empathy for the lowliest things in existence-the neck of a broken bottle, a scrap of pigskin-can be seen as the expression of compassion by one who knew what it was to grow up in utter poverty and who wanted, consciously or unconsciously, to remind his reader that even the most neglected object has a dignity of its own, or at least imagines so. In an uncanny way, Andersen moved creative fantasy ahead toward the ani- mation, in fantasy, of inanimate man- made objects, exactly at the time when the influence of the Industrial Revolu- tion was about to alter man's life be- yond recognition. It is as if he had intuitively, seismographically, under- stood that mankind, in his own time, stood on the threshold of a new age and would soon recast his material en- vironment and, beyond that, would be- come involved in technological and psychological attempts to adjust to the inanimate works of his own creation. Andersen created the "industrial revolution" in children's literature, the animism in modern fantasy. In the generations following him, man-made objects have managed to improve their lot and their relative importance, both in reality and in the realm of fantasy. MAGIC OBJECTS AND AUTONOMOUS OBJECTS10 From Andersen's stories about ani- mated objects, two main types of chil- dren's literature have grown: stories about animated dolls and toy animals; and stories about useful and serviceable objects (tools, gadgets, and machines). Although dolls and toy animals that come to life in children's daydreams and fantasies, and in the fantasy stories written for them, are man-made objects, at least they have been created for the express purpose of serving as objects to which the child is supposed to be- come attached; their function is to rep- resent biological beings toward whom real emotional attachment-love, hate, 8Ibid., pp. 326-27. 9 Ibid., pp. 172-84. 10In the following sections of this study most of the examples referred to in the text will be taken from American research, and literature for chil- dren and adults, etc. The reason for this is that American sources were the most easily accessible at the time of writing this paper. Another reason is, of course, the fact that the phenomena dealt with are to be found in America more than else- where, America being the most highly developed technological society. But examples taken from other cultures and languages will be introduced to emphasize the fact that these phenomena are inti- mately connected with the evolution of technology and cybernetics and that the problems they pose are of concern to man and society everywhere.</page><page sequence="4">MACHINE ANIMISM IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE 81 confidence, admiration, etc.-is possi- ble, or even necessary. They have symbolic significance as vehicles for projection and identification. They are, moreover, the descendants of what Gar- land calls "the great tradition of an- thropomorphism""-the descendants of sacred effigies and statues and images that symbolically represented gods and goddesses in countless cults and, of course, of the toys that children cher- ished in almost every culture and every generation. And they are, after all, an- thropomorphic or theriomorphic-they resemble real creatures who have faces and limbs and personalities. Learning to relate to these real beings, even when they are represented by proxy, is one of the decisive aspects of grow- ing up and of living. Another no less important point will become manifest through a short sur- vey of the development of the doll and toy animal stories. Arbuthnot"2 and Meigs et al."3 trace this development through the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and make it clear-without commenting on it-that animation more often than not takes place in an excep- tional, often magical, situation or be- cause the child loves his toy so much that his wish comes true. Coming to life is an exceptionally rare experience, as it were, not an ordinary, everyday occurrence. Some of the examples cited by these authors include: Collodi's Pinocchio, Margery W. Bianco's Vel- veteen Rabbit, A. A. Milne's Winnie- the-Pooh, Elizabeth 0. Jones's Big Susan, Enys Tregarthen's The Doll Who Came Alive. The fantasy situation adopted by stories of this type is, therefore, one in which the child relates in a psycho- logically meaningful way to the fan- tastic creatures of the writers' minds; yet they, the animated toys, usually depend on him and are not his equals. The human child's superiority is-ex- actly as in animal stories and in the child's relation to his pets-one of the educative values of those relationships because it partly balances and partly compensates for his inferiority feelings toward the adults in his life. However, the other type-stories about functional, useful artifacts-does not seem to possess these educationally valuable attributes. Here and there one can find objects that belong to a magic world: "And the soup ladle was walking up the table towards Alice's chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of its way."''4 Yet the twentieth cen- tury has evolved stories about man- made objects that are represented as "naturally" active, autonomous in their actions, and co-existing with the child on a basis of equality and even, on occasion, being superior to him. They share the child's world in a matter-of- fact manner, relate to him and care for him out of their own free will, as it were. ANTHROPOMORPHIC VEHICLES AND MACHINES The personified, anthromorphic ma- chine as the hero of stories has, espe- cially in picture books, become a major trend; but it has been carried over to other types of children's literature for various age groups.

It is, therefore, only natural that gad- gets and machines should loom promi- nently in children's books in an era and a society that is, in fact, based on tech- nological development. Some of the es- sential attributes of machinery-its colorfulness, its acoustic quality, and its usually locomotive character-make it especially attractive to children. The many stories and poems in which in- animate machinery plays an important role have the additional task of cater- ing to the child's daydreams and serve the goal of wish fulfilment in fantasy: While the child who dreams of operat- ing machines cannot yet do so in reality, he can do so in fantasy. At the same time, machinery in stories, as in his play, aids him in overcoming fears of the powerful contraption that he har- bors in his mind. A good example is the story about "Johnny's Machines,""5 where the little boy tells his grand- father that he likes to push buttons; so grandfather brings in more and more machines, and the farm becomes mech- anized, while Johnny and grandfather are continually proud of and fascinated by the mysterious things. "It was all because Johnny likes to push buttons." Another example would be "Smoky and the Red Fire Engine."16 A stray dog who is fascinated by the red fire engine one day succeeds in riding on it to be present at a fire where he saves a girl's doll. By this act he gains a home for himself. The machine's important role is brought out well, but people and dogs are even more important. In these stories, machines are pre- sented to the child as interesting and intriguing; yet they are mechanical creations of man's ingenuity and noth- ing else. Adults or children are the stories' actors and heroes. With the ap- pearance of the anthropomorphic ma- chine in children's literature, however, this is changed decisively. They, the machines, are animated; they usually have names and have the ability to think and, even more so, to relate emo- tionally to others like themselves and to animals and human beings. They become co-protagonists or sole pro- tagonists of the story. The child is ex- pected-this is what the story proposes to him-to enter into a meaningful emo- tional fantasy relation to it-him-her, exactly as he would be expected to do in a story about a human being or an animal. In other words, he is asked to identify with the machine-hero's ex- ploits and personality. It is assumed that he will learn from them and that these stories will advantageously in- fluence the development of his person- ality. The fact that, unlike humans and animals and, in fantasy at least, effigies, dolls, and toys, machines have actually only a strictly functional raison d'etre- this fact is neglected. Within the confines of the story that humanizes machines, several more or less distinct types can be recognized. The distinction appears to be created mainly by the two criteria of the degree of intensity with which personification is carried out, and the degree of mean- ingfulness inherent in the machtne as protagonist. In general, the two criteria can be said to be interdependent vari- ables; the more important the machine "5Helen Palmer, "Johnny's Machines," in Ellen L.

Type 1.-There are stories in which machines are portrayed in a mild form of personification as having only slight emotional attributes. The emphasis is on the work done together, but a mutual co-operativeness and respect more or less pervade the story: Men care for machines just as machines care for men. Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne, his steam shovel,'7 both work better when admiring people watch their com- mon effort. In the end, they bask to- gether in the town's esteem. The driver of "the taxi that hurried"'8 is proud of his smart little car: "We're a speedy pair" (my italics). The taxi "liked to tear along in a hurry, purring softly." "Tuggy the tugboat" and Captain Lar- son grow old together and do not easily adjust to change:'9 "We like steam boilers, don't we?"; yet in the end they are "now happier than they have ever been before." These machines are not yet autono- mous, but man's superiority over them is only a slight one; he cannot operate without their aid, and, most important, they are alive. As Arbuthnot says of Mike Mulligan and Mary Anne, who has turned from a steam shovel to a furnace, "Both lived a warm, pros- perous, and respected life ever after."20 Type 2.-In a somewhat similar cate- gory are stories like Maybelle the Cable Car,21 and the German story Henriette Bimmelbahn.22 While the accent is as yet on the machine's performance, the emotional attachment becomes more outspoken, and the machine more cen- tral as protagonist. Maybelle the Cable Car tells the story of how San Fran- cisco's cable cars were saved by the enthusiasm of the city's inhabitants, from the cable car's point of view. While at the beginning the story relates that "she" has a conductor and a grip- man, in the end she, in an autonomous decision, gratefully invites the people for a free ride. The reader is told what she and her sisters think, remember, the moods that grip; the limit between machines and human beings is felt less. Henriette Bimmelbahn is actually a grandmother figure; together with her engineer she chugs on, readily leaves the rails to bring the children to the woods, waits patiently until the last of them has picked all the flowers he wants, together with the engineer is very upset when the train collides with a cow, and returns home tired but still good-natured. Type 3.-This type is the newest ver- sion of the "tale of the young hero," the hero being the machine. In the face of fearfully grim odds and after (rela- tively) unbelievable adventurous ex- ploits, the hero is victorious, and the spice of the story is provided by the contrast; whoever seemed to be strong and powerful suddenly finds himself dependent on the achievements of one who was until now held to be small, helpless, bashful, and inferior. In fact, this type is a transmutation, a continuation of the age-old myth of 17 Virginia L. Burton, Mike Mulligan and His Steam Shovel (Boston: Hotughton Mifflin Co., 1939). 18 Lucy S.

Moses and Pharaoh, Joseph and his brothers, David and Goliath, Her- cules and his tasks, Siegfried and the dragon, Cinderella and her stepmother and stepsisters are variants of this paradigm. During the last decades, with the development of children's litera- ture, this motif has been reworked and retold countless times, of adventurous young children who are held in scorn, of adventurous doggies, kittens, young bears, etc., who defy the authority of their elders and return triumphant, having learned something about them- selves and the world. On the way, the motif has often acquired a trivial or picayune mode; yet its unflagging uni- versal popularity testifies to its psycho- logical meaningfulness. Of late, it has become the nucleus of accounts of ad- venturous and misjudged young ma- chines. The Little Red Engine, in an Israeli version of a British title,24 is held in contempt by the big overland stream- lined locomotives, for all he does is slowly trudge his way over small dis- stances. Yet the day comes when the superengine bearing the king and his entourage jumps the rails in a snow- storm. The stationmaster is in despair, but Little Red Engine saves the day. After an excited dialogue between the two, the stationmaster entrusts the un- dersized engine with the king's train. During his long journey, the engine goodnaturedly talks with engines, frogs, and people. After triumphantly enter- ing the capital, he returns home and, acclaimed by all the big, important engines, returns to his former modest life, full of inner happiness. Young Homer25 is a shiny red ca- boose; he is gay, "lively as a newborn colt.... Railroad steam is in his blood, and there's adventure in his eye." He loses his home train and makes friends with the animals, the human beings, and the old engine of a circus. When they all are in danger of being derailed and thrown into the deep gorge, Homer, putting his right wheel forward, in con- cert with the animals and against in- credible odds, saves them and himself from certain death. No human inter- vention is needed. Human beings ap- pear only at the end of the story, when the whole town turns out to acclaim Homer the hero and to cheer the brave animals. The main characteristics of this type are these: The hero is inferior and weak, and different from the rest; a catastrophical situation of some kind- 23Among the most important books that have dealt with the subject, one might mention: Otto Rank, The Myth of the Birth of the Hero, trans.

The former so- cial stigma is replaced by grateful recognition of his feats. Up to this point, the type follows the general outline of the "young hero" story. It differs from it in two ways: (1) While the tradi- tional young hero becomes, after his return, the leader of his kind, this is not true here: socially he becomes equal to them but subsides into his old posi- tion. Not achieving a position of leader- ship is important, but gaining full, social status by proving oneself and so shed- ding one's role as an outsider is crucial. (This is true also of the modern young child-hero and the animal-hero.) (2) The other dissimilarity results from the peculiar nature of the new hero. He usually maintains cordial relations, based on mutual understanding, with men and occasionally with animals. They all live in "one world." Actually, this is a mixed type, con- sidering the extent of autonomy. Some of the machines depend upon the close co-operation of men in their work; others operate in full autonomy, driven (sic) by their own discernment and conscience. Type 4.-This type contrasts with the story of the young hero by stating unequivocally that adventure does not pay. It is one form of the modern mor- alizing and cautionary tale. Two main subtypes can be dis- tinguished. The first presents engines that become involved in adventures be- cause they feel an urge to be free of the restrictions placed upon them by man: that is, they are essentially in- ferior to and dependent on human be- ings, and while they are allowed to enjoy the adventure, they learn that work and responsibility are preferable. In the Russian "The Story of a Holi- day,""7 the truck for once wanted to have a good rest on his day off. He felt hot under his roof and left. The green traffic light winked, saying, "Where is your driver?" The automo- bile understands the problem: "I can- not run alone, and still I do run alone; so what? It's a day off today, and it would be a sin not to go for a trip." Reflecting further on his own strange situation, he finds that "they probably decided to direct me by radio. So what, after all this is the twentieth century, the century of miracles. Let's go on!" The truck pulls off the road and into the woods. After a good rest, his re- sponsibility exerts itself again, and wandering lonely between oaks and birches, he collects a full load of mush- rooms which he carries back to his garage. "And now he runs more gladly and carries his loads better." Choo-Choo,28 by Virginia Burton, is the story of a little engine who ran away. Normally the little engine had an engineer, a fireman, and a conduc- tor; she pulled cars full of people, and a baggage car; she did her job well. One day, however, she was tired and said to herself, "I could go farther and easier by myself-people would say, 'what a smart little engine.'" She es- capes, goes wild, jumps over an open ' Arbuthnot, op. cit., p. 307. 7 V. Berestov, "Shaska pro Vuikhodnoi djen," Karzinki v Lushakh (Moscow: Ministerstya Kul- tur, 1962). ' Virginia L.

When she is rescued by the combined efforts of many people, she is very glad to be found and tells Jim, the engineer, that she will not run away again. While this story belongs to the first subtype, in which the adventures are usually described as delightful and where the machine is normally operated by human beings, the accent put on the cautionary elements in Choo-Choo's adventure is more reminiscent of the second subtype. Here the cautionary and moralizing intention becomes stronger and more outspoken. Another change is that the human operator dis- appears and the engine acts on his or her own. The Little Freighter29 is socially a lower-class boat; other boats deride her: She is so squat, so deep in the water. When she is unloaded, she dances lightly on the water and feels better, is more like the others. But she gets frightened in a storm-"Oh dear, what is happening to me?"-is again derided by her fellow boats, and wishes to be loaded again and to be deep and safe in the water; and then the other boats will not be jealous. Adventure teaches that it is best to keep one's social sta- tion and acquiesce in it. Tootle30 is an outstanding example of the close mutual relations and under- standing among men, machines, and animals. Tootle is a young locomotive who goes to engine school. His fellow students are engines, his teachers men. The two main lessons taught in the school are "Stop at the red light" and "Stay on the rails no matter what." The reward for being a good student is to become a big streamliner. Tootle is one of the best students the school has had in a long time. Yet one day he finds out how delightful it is to leave the tracks and to look for flowers, so "The Dreadful Thing" happens, and Tootle becomes quite giddy with all the sunshine, the flowers, and the frogs. He is seduced by a black horse and races it across the fields. Tootle's hu- man teachers are consternated. Tootle's fellow (engine) students look down upon him. The school principal informs the mayor, who in turn alerts the citi- zens, and all combine to return Tootle to the track. By holding up red flags wherever he turns in his escapades among the flowers, they bewilder him; then he discovers his teacher, who stands on the track signaling him with the green flag. The young engine who grew enthusiastic about flowers and fell in love with a horse is chastised by men's care and solicitude. By foregoing his individualistic leanings and con- forming to the signals, he will earn 100 A+. The notable characteristics of this type of story are, then, rather narrowly moralistic. The spirit of adventure leads to errors of judgment and to disaster. As one's elders know better, one should listen to them and prove oneself by hard work, keeping to one's station in life. Type 5.-The Brave Bookmobile"1 represents yet another type of story characteristic of our times. Every morn- ing the bookmobile sets out to do its work, modestly and usefully, like any anonymous worker. This is a variant of one of the possibly less fortuitous in- ventions of Progressive Education: the realistic, and didactic, and dull story '9 Clara Lambart "Little Freighter," in L. S.

Though most stories can be assigned to one of these types, there are excep- tions, of course. One rather absurd ex- ample is Ivor the Engine,32 an English book whose story is set in Wales. Ivor lived in a shed, did its work conscien- tiously, in harmony with its human op- erators. One day, however, Ivor hears the Choral Society practicing. From that moment he is not his own old self any more. "And that night he went to bed very, very sad." Soon the humans notice; he is examined, and "mechani- cally speaking, I've never seen a better one. It's my belief he's upset. You haven't spoken to him harshly, have you?" In the end, the human operators find out what is wrong because a tear drops from Ivor's window. Organ pipes are fitted to him, the Choral Society looks forward to his participation, and the railway company agrees to it. Be- fore the rehearsal starts, "Ivor sudden- ly felt funny in his boiler, oh dear, quite queasy. Nervous he was." But then he ''was so pleased that he quite forgot to feel nervous." When the story ends, the Choral Society stands and sings, and Ivor, on the railway tracks-ad maio- rem mackini gloriam-as in olden times people gathered near to the organ, only the organ did not weep, and people did not sing to help it. But now, similar to what happened in Tootle, Ivor's psy- chomechano-therapy is carried out, as the dust jacket says, "with the help of nearly everybody else in that part of Wales." These books constitute, of course, only a small sample of the existing lit- erature in many countries. A list of lit- erature for children and adults refer- ring to engines and prepared toward an exhibition arranged for the Internation- al Youth Library (in Munich in 1955) by H. Kiinnemann, contains some two hundred items in six languages, many of them stories about personified ma- chines. This list also reflects the fact that these books are to be found in translations to many languages. The anthropomorphic machine has gained importance mainly in picture books for children aged three to seven. But it has not stopped there. In the last few years it has also appeared-influ- enced by recent scientific developments -in the literature written for older children, especially in the form of sto- ries about androidal robots. This type of literature has an inter- esting early forerunner, The Wizard of Oz.33 Two man-made creatures, very different from each other, appear in the story. One is the Scarecrow, who feels like a new man when Dorothy, the hero- ine, sets him on the ground. He adds, however, "'I don't know anything. You see, I am stuffed, so I have no brain at all,' he answered sadly." This last word proves that he has emotions at least. As the story develops he demonstrates no little helpfulness, and he has the great advantage of never being tired. The other man-made figure is the Tin Wood- man. When Dorothy finds him, he is tin-made throughout, and the only thing she can do for him is to take an oil can and oil his rusty joints. Yet he once was a perfect human being who lost his bio- logical body, part by part, because of his stubborn love for a girl that was op- posed by some wicked woman. Limb after limb was replaced with a tin one made by a tinsmith. Now he has no heart and so does not care. Yet he feels 82 Oliver Postgate, Ivor the Engine (London: Abelard-Schuman, 1962). 3 Frank L.

This modern fantasy is halfway between Andersen and the sixties of the twentieth century: The animation of the inanimate is pos- sible because the setting is a magic country, and a magically endowed girl performs it in harmony with the age- old tradition; on the other hand, the problem of how far man is superior to his creations, and of humanization- dehumanization has a definitely modern ring. The Scarecrow and the Tin Wood- man are man-made contraptions that are able to create emotional appeal in humans. Children's books about robots writ- ten in the 1960's, inspired by adult sci- ence fiction, treat robots as equal to hu- mans. Andy Buckram's Tin Men34 is an adventure story for boys. Its hero is a boy who builds robots out of tin cans. In the beginning, they are ordinary ro- bots fit for just one very simple job, or less than that; they are operated by be- ing plugged in. At a certain moment in the story, however, lightning that strikes them causes a transformation: while they still have no minds, in their new state of electrification they are able to understand human language. From then on-and actually even before this point-human beings relate to the ro- bots, have feelings for them, attempt to make them feel joyful just as they feel joy at their rescue. The three children, a boy and two girls, one a baby, inter- mingle with the four robots, one "girl" and three "boys," one a baby, and rely on them for their safe return from dan- ger, while the role of the mastermind remains securely with Andy. The most curious element in this story is the development of Campbell, the first and youngest of the robots. As things evolve it becomes clear that Campbell is a mutation of the tradition- al despised young hero. Campbell arouses emotions from the first. For about two-thirds of the story he is liked by all the female figures in the book and held in scorn by his creator; and Camp- bell himself, too, develops the power of emotion. He sits down shyly by himself with his head hanging. Then he accepts Sparrow's (Andy's girl friend's) hand- kerchief and presses it against his cheek. He grows up a little, and later, he saves the human baby from the big bear, and Andy recants and recognizes the real hero in him. At the same time, Campbell has somehow matured. The story ends in a strange way. Be- cause of a wrong command given by Andy, the robots row away, and they and the boat are lost. Andy and Spar- row very speedily console themselves for the loss by prying out of the sand a new tin can, the start of a new batch of robots. The ending is curious, too. The robots row away, independently, into an unknown future and are immediately forgotten by their human friends. This throws a strange light on the emotional attachments that evolved all through the almost two hundred pages of the story. There is a certain inconclusive- ness in this ending concerning the rela- tions between men and their machines. The Runaway Robot35 is the story of a robot's indelible friendship with the son of his owners, as told by Rex the robot himself. His personality is very rich in its emotional possibilities: Rex learns to worry, to care, to act inde- pendently, being motivated by love, and even to be happy. Yet more: he be- comes involved in moral questions. A police sergeant informs him, "You'll have to learn that about humans, Rex. . . .They say a lot of irresponsible 34 Carol R.

While in the story the question of superiority of human or robot is not solved, it is clear that its hero is the robot, not the boy. It should be emphasized that not a few of the stories mentioned here are fun to read and have a humor and charm of their own. Others are trite and trivial. This is true of this as of any other type of story. These, then, are some of the ani- mated artifacts and machines that serve as protagonists. The child reader is sup- posed to identify with them; he is asked to learn from them and to emulate them; he is induced to relate to them, and it is assumed that in his fantasy he will look upon them as communicating with him. It appears that this kind of children's literature has not brought into being any new types or motifs. It has, how- ever, created a new and questionable type of hero; by extending the limits of animism, modern fantasy has originated the story in which animated and per- sonified objects and machines are equal to and often superior to the human be- ings with whom they live together in ''one world." FANTASIES FOR ADULTS Children's literature is not, and never has been, an isolated phenomenon. Very early in the evolution of modern tech- nology, the overt attitude of admiration and pride, and the usually covert one of uneasiness and fear, created an uncon- scious conflict about machines in the mind of Western man. As so often in the individual and collective history of man, when he is confronted with a con- flicting mental attitude toward forces beyond his control, he turns, in his at- tempt to solve the conflict, to the device of projecting onto these forces the hu- man attributes of emotion, reason, and volition, by way of animation and per- sonification. In this manner the modern anthropomorphic myth of the machine is born; from the outset the myth has these two often intermingling aspects: (1) the Promethean-the machine as a powerful servant "who" aids man to subordinate nature; and (2) the apoca- lyptic-the fear of man's losing mastery over what he has created. Later a third aspect of the myth will come into exist- ence: the machine as a benevolent and equal companion to man; resulting from the effort to bring it-him-her "into the family." Since the first half of the nineteenth century, literary expression reflecting realistically, metaphorically, and sym- bolically man's predicament of having to adapt mentally to his inventions has proliferated. In the following com- ments, an attempt is made to assess the place of children's literature on animis- tic machines within the framework of adult culture as a whole. As a necessary correlate of this de- velopment, a new issue appears-the danger of the dehumanization of man and the mechanization of human rela- tions. This is foreshadowed in the nine- teenth century, for example, in the writings of Dickens, Melville, and Henry Adams. Promethean personification is found relatively little, for whenever man's in- genuity is praised, the machine usually remains inanimate. Thomas Wolfe writes: "One feels the brakes go on when the train is coming to a river, and one knows that old gloved hand of cunning is at the throttle. One's own sense of manhood and mastery is heightened by being on a train."36 36 Thomas Wolfe, Y'ou Can't Go Home Again (New York: Harper &amp; Bros., 1934), p. 55.</page><page sequence="13">90 THE LIBRARY QUARTERLY Yet Wolfe, who is ever fascinated by men and machines, does personify ma- chinery, when some anxiety is involved: "They believed in that ship, and sud- denly they loved her. They loved her delicate, bending strength, her proud undulance that was like the stride of a proud, beautiful woman." The ambivalent vision, the inner ten- sion that results from conflicting atti- tudes, can be illustrated in Stephen Vincent Benet's verses: The great, metallic beast . . . The genie we have raised to rule the earth, Obsequious to our will But servant-master still, The tireless serf already half a god . . .37 A similar mood is expressed in a charming little poem: A tourist from outer space asserts that the creatures of this star are composed of metal and glass; their legs are circular, and they turn round and round; they have four eyes, and the two in the back are red. The question the tourist has not yet found the answer for is: those soft shapes that can be seen, like shadows, inside the transparent body-are they their guts or their brains?38 These examples illustrate the motif in our thinking that has been formu- lated by Bruno Bettelheim: "While our progress can be measured by the fact that the machine is clearly recognized as the servant of man and not his better, the fear is now widespread that it could become our master."39 The apocalyptic personification is il- lustrative of Fromm's more pessimistic formulation: "While creating new and better means for mastering nature [man] has become enmeshed in a net- work of those means. . . . While becom- ing the master of nature, he has become the slave of the machine which his own hands built."40 Capek's play, R.U.R.,41 is one of the first full-length treatments of the theme. Man succeeds in creating robots that are similar to man except for their in- ability as yet to act independently and to have emotions. But later, while among men a movement is under foot to guarantee their civil rights, the mil- lions of robots revolt and overcome and exterminate man. Then the robots de- velop the ability to experience feelings: they are now afraid of death; and as a robot and a robotess love each other, a new race is born that will inherit the earth. The apocalyptic significance of the play is enhanced by this seemingly optimistic ending: if nothing is gained by the extinction of the human race, at least nothing is lost. The manifestly apocalyptic approach, according to Moskowitz' Introduction to The Coming of the Robots,42 is typi- cal of early science fiction in the nine- teenth century and the first decades of the twentieth. A variation of this view is the view of the machine, and especially the loco- motive, as a symbol of forces, of higher powers, of the dreadful and incompre- hensible. Kiinnemann makes the point that "the number of authors is legion, 'Quoted in Education in a Changing Society (Washington: National Education Association, 1964), p. 31. 3 May Swenson, "Southbound on the Freeway," New Yorker, 38 (February 2, 1963), 32. 39Bruno Bettelheim, The Inforned Heart: Au- tonomy in a Mass 4ge (Glencoe, Ill.: Free Press, 1960), p. 61. 40 Erich Fromm, Man for Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics (New York: Rine- hart &amp; Co., 1947), p. 4. 41 Karel eapek, R.U.R.

Dbblin (Berlin-Alexan- derplatz), F. Durrenmatt (The Visit of the Old Lady), A. Schwarz-Bart (The Last of the Just), and others.43 Psychological research testifies to the significance of these phenomena. In a section entitled "Delusions for Mod- erns," Bruno Bettelheim writes: WVhat is so new in the hopes and fears of the machine age is that savior and destroyer are no longer clothed in the image of man; no longer are the figures that we imagine can save and destroy us direct projections of our hu- man image. The transition from the useful but mindless machine to the manipulator if not the killer of man is viewed not as a change in kind, but a change in quality or degree.44 The term "Delusions for Moderns" reminds one of the fact that, back in 1899, Thorstein Veblen suggested that animism in relation to objects and sit- uations is characteristic of predatory cultures. Not much has happened since then to disprove his hypothesis.45 How can it be explained, then, that alongside the Promethean and the apoc- alyptic, there appears the third view- that of the humanized and benevolent machine? Defined more precisely, the machine appears to be a creature simi- lar to man and to have human attri- butes. It is man's associate and equal companion; it is, to repeat the formu- lation used above, brought into the family. In fantasy, it is a living thing, not really different from man. This strange conception has become a mainstay of modern fantasy. To be sure, to some extent it must have ex- isted before our time, but now it has become a major motif. At the end of the nineteenth century J. K. Huysmans, in his novel A Re- bours, has the central character fall in love with "two locomotives recently put into service." One of these, bearing the name of Crampton, is an adorable blonde with a shrill voice, a long slender body imprisoned in a shining brass corset, and supple cat-like movements; a smart golden blonde whose extraordinary grace can be quite terrifying when she stiffens her mus- cles of steel [and] sends the sweat pouring down her flanks. . . . The other, Engerth by name, is a strapping saturnine brunette, given to raucous guttural cries.46 The theme is also ubiquitously treated in satire: In "Ever-Lovin' Ma- chine ,"47 a deceived human lover tells of the mechanical girl he built and loved until she ran off with the toaster. If machines can love and be loved, they can relate and be related to in other ways as well. In "I, Robot,"48 the machine, significantly named Adam Link, is possessed by feelings of loyalty and friendliness for humans and be- comes a monster only because of their lack of comprehension. If so, machines can also be viewed as children. Cartoons illustrate this: Sci- entist to robot: "...and stop calling me Daddy."49 Similarly, machines can hold a posi- tion of authority: Cartoon: Reception- ist to client: "Our computer will see you now, sir."

It says, 'Cogito, ergo sum. X 51 What then-to repeat the question- are the sources of this creation of fan- tasy, the machine experienced as inti- mately close, understandable and un- derstanding? The Promethean view is an uncompli- cated, conscious expression of justified pride in man's ingenuity: it represents an optimistic acceptance of his achieve- ments and, implicitly or explicitly, hopeful expectations for the future for increasing his mastery. The apocalyptic view expresses man's profound appre- hension and anxiety when confronted with seemingly unruly forces that com- pel him to undergo rapid and extensive changes and yet to cling fearfully to horizons lost forever. Man resorts to animation and personification of the in- animate-as individual and collective man has tended to in his development whenever his mind was faced with the incomprehensible. Is the humanized- benevolent-equal view, then, a symbolic revelation of legitimate affection, of ac- quiescence to a phenomenon that has come to stay? Some would have it like this. Animation and personification of the inanimate is, however, not a rational process-it is not the recognition of something that exists objectively. It is a symptom of irrational, and largely un- conscious, processes; it is a projection of human characteristics onto objects that in fact cannot actually possess them. When this is done consistently, over a long period, it reveals the prob- lematic importance of this category of objects.52 The personification of the machine as humane is, in this conception, nothing but the result of a repressive tendency, a transformation, a masking, of the apocalyptic one, in the face of mount- ing anxiety. This can be gauged by the fact that, when examined more closely, not a few of the "equal" machines brought in above as examples of the benevolent view turn out to be subtly superior. Modern animism in general, then, is an expression of unrest and ambivalence in Western culture; the resulting con- flict is represented in imagery that is symptomatic of man's concern with his place in society and with his human es- sence. Specifically, animation and personi- fication that portray the inanimate ob- ject as benevolent and intimately re- sponsive, as existing on the same level of life as man, symbolize the intensifica- tion of anxiety to an unbearable degree. The conflict is ousted from conscious- ness by the projection of human, attrac- tive, and pleasing attributes onto the objects. Thus the conflict is hidden or at least disguised.

The functioning of this unconscious mechanism, together with the ubiqui- tousness of machines in modern life, makes it understandable why, supple- menting the attribution of human char- acteristics to machines, modern fantasy offers so many instances of conferring machinelike traits upon human beings. This feature is typical for a technologi- cal civilization that struggles for its ma- turity. It could be documented by ex- amples to be found on all levels of the creative arts. Andrei Voznesensky, the poet, writes: "That redhead, like someone be- spattered with egg yolk, is transformed into a pneumatic drill."54 Or, one teenage student in a class I taught, in discussing a poem narrating King Saul's last moments in his battle against the Philistines, summed up her impression by saying that "he was mov- ing about like an excited teleprinter." But there is more to this. In much of the creative expression of our time, in art and in science, there can be found a strange, growing awareness of man and machine living in "one world" and drawing nearer to the point of becom- ing, in a sense, mutually interchange- able. Actually, even this began in the nine- teenth century. McLuhan makes the point that As early as 1872, Samuel Butler's Erewhon explored the curious ways in which machines were coming to resemble organisms not only in the way they obtained power by digestion of fuel but in their capacity to evolve ever new types of themselves with the help of the ma- chine tenders. This organic character of the machines, he saw, was more than matched by the speed with which people who minded them were taking on the rigidity of and thoughtless behaviorism of the machine.55 One day, probably, Walt Disney's animated cartoons will be recognized as a major symbol of this process of mu- tual interchangeability: are those jerky creatures not both mechanical men and hominoid mechanisms? In fact, Marcel Duchamp made the same point much earlier in his painting, "Nude Descend- ing Staircase, No. 2." Behind this, of course, lurks the spec- tre of dehumanization. How serious is all this? Serious enough to call for the attention of the scientist and the philos- opher: Scientist Norbert Wiener, the man who created cybernetics, warns: I should like to mention a certain attitude of the man in the street toward cybernetics and automatization. This attitude needs a critical discussion, and in my opinion it should be rejected in its entirety. This is the assump- tion that machines cannot possess any degree of originality . . . that nothing can come out of the machine which has not been put into it. This is often interpreted as asserting that a machine which man has made must remain continually subject to man. . . . On the basis of such an attitude, many people have pooh- poohed the dangers of machine techniques, and they have flatly contradicted the early predictions of Samuel Butler that the machine might take over the control of mankind. . . It is my thesis that machines can and do '3 This is, of course, a double illusion, the second aspect of which is to assume that human beings, because they have a soul, are reasonable by that token. 5'Andrei Voznesensky, "Striptease," trans.

The "Sorcerer's Apprentice" is only one of many tales based on the assumption that the agencies of magic are literal-minded. There is the story of the genie and the fisherman in the Arabian Nights, in which the fisherman breaks the seal of Solomon which has imprisoned the genie and finds the genie vowed to his own destruction.56 Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus of Mas- sachusetts Institute of Technology is wondering: "If something that we knew was just a machine could behave intel- ligently, it would tend to suggest that maybe we are just machines." Would such computers have to be considered conscious beings? Would they raise a civil liberties problem?57 And Professor Mortimer J. Adler asks: How does man differ from everything else on earth-from plants and animals, and from machines, including computers and electric brains? . If, on the one hand, it can be decisively es- tablished that man does not differ radically from other animals and machines, what differ- ence will this make to traditional religious be- liefs about man's special dignity and destiny, and to the juridical, political, and moral prin- ciples that rest on the distinction between man and thing?58 It appears, then, that the anthropo- morphic machine in children's literature is not an isolated phenomenon. It is one facet of a growing myth. THE ANTHROPOMORPHIC MACHINE AS AN EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE Machine animation can, in fantasy for the adult, assume three forms: the Promethean, the apocalyptic, and the benevolent. In children's literature, however, only benevolent animation ap- pears. If the hypothesis offered above is correct, and benevolent animation is the result of anxiety repressed and forced into the unconscious, to reappear in the form of human characteristics projected onto the machine, then stories about animated objects written by adult writ- ers for children are a medium through which adults unconsciously communi- cate to children their own repressed anxieties. If this is so, then this type of literature unwittingly prepares the child for acquiescence to a "one-world" sit- uation,59 for life in a society whose members experience an unconscious in- feriority vis-a-vis machines and make an effort to adapt to them. Then en- gines can teach the rules of life, that is, they assume superego functions. "Ma- chines are looking at you"-Andersen's paranoid streak has become socialized. As unconscious anxiety is clearly a psychological hindrance to the develop- ment of a healthy personality and to mature (as against dehumanized) ad- justment to life, children's literature of this kind cannot be viewed favorably from the educational point of view. Another issue is the danger of func- tionalization of human relations in a machine age. The machine hero and its story can be easily recognized as a par- ticularly apt medium through which to reinforce these tendencies: The ma- chine's pride lies first and foremost in ' Norbert Wiener, "Some Moral and Technical Consequences of Automation," Science, 131 (May 6,1960), 1355-58. 57 "What (If Anything) to Expect from Today's Philosophers," Time, 87 (January 7, 1966), 25. 8Mortimer J. Adler, "Six Lectures on the Dif- ference of Man and the Difference It Makes" (Encyclopaedia Britannica Lectures, University of Chicago, 1966). 9 In the sense in which this term has been used in the present paper: humans, animals, and ma- chines living together.</page><page sequence="18">MACHINE ANIMISM IN CHILDREN'S LITERATURE 95 its functional perfection, in its flawless performance; it is satisfied with a rela- tive paucity of relationships. The ma- chine actually has no individuality-one caboose and one railway engine have almost exactly the same makeup and the same problems as the rest of them; it has the typically trivial personality that is representative of-and unwit- tingly aids to prepare children for-the functional co-operative anonymity re- quired by industrial society. In addi- tion, machines almost never are allowed to play; they usually work and work and are quite happy with it. They are represented as children, but they do not live a child's life. They are happier and more adjusted when they do some use- ful work. They are reliable because they have learned that the spirit of adven- ture and of playfulness leads to disas- ter. They are representatives of a very narrow functionalistic technical ethos. One more point may be mentioned: The constant and accumulating betray- al of the child's aesthetic experience by this type of literature is an affront to his taste. He ought to be offended by an illustration showing a machine ogling at butterflies; by the spectacle of one ma- chine expressing his love for another by flowers brought by a human;60 by a truck collecting mushrooms by itself; by being taught the joys of music by a steam engine; by being shown a steam shovel that lives, happily metamor- phosed into a furnace, in a cozy cellar with a human being; by being told by numberless illustrators that their gro- tesque, smiling, or melancholy engines' headlights see light and motion, like animals, while they really emit light. Should so much weight be attached to a type of literature that is, after all, only one among many? Again and again one is tempted to put these stories aside and shrug them off. But then, these stories are read by millions of children. And again, psycho- logical, sociological, educational, and scientific writing makes it clear that they are but one facet of that modern myth which has sprung up in our era, and not a myth alone: The struggle be- tween the dehumanization of man and its alternative, the humanization of in- dustrial society, takes place both in man's fantasy and in his reality, on the psychological as well as on the techno- logical level. Erikson warns psycholo- gists and educators: "Our child-training customs have begun to standardize modern man, so that he may become a reliable mechanism prepared to adjust to the competitive exploitation of the machine world. In fact, certain modern trends in child training seem to repre- sent a magic identification with the ma- chine, analogous to identifications of primitive tribes with their principal prey."6' A few of the machine books will not hurt the child. Many will. And they are unrewarding reading matter. There are still so many stories written that offer the child more wholesome objects for identification. What the child needs are books that are conducive to the maturing of his own humanness. What the child needs to be taught by his books-and by his educators-is re- spect for life and for meaningful rela- tionships with living human beings, of whom he is one.
