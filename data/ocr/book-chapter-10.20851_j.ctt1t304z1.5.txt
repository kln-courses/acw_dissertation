<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 3 An artist in the making: The early  drawings of Charles-Alexandre Lesueur  during the Baudin expedition to Australia John West-Sooby, The University of Adelaide The link between scientific discovery and empire building was never more evident  than in the latter decades of the eighteenth century. During that time, as Mary Louise  Pratt has noted, the 'international scientific expedition' became 'one of Europe's  proudest and most conspicuous instruments of expansion'.1 For Pratt, this period  coincided with the emergence of a new version of Europe's 'planetary consciousness'  — one which was characterised by 'the construction of global-scale meaning through  the descriptive apparatuses of natural history'.2 Empirical observations of the natural world were indeed indispensable to the  European Enlightenment ambition of obtaining a complete and taxonomic knowledge  of the globe — and thereby gaining mastery over it. At this time, too, there was a  growing realisation that the visual could play just as valuable a part in that process as  the verbal. Accordingly, by the end of the eighteenth century, it had become common  1 M.L.

Their role  was to keep a pictorial record of the places visited, the peoples encountered and the  specimens of flora and fauna that were collected or otherwise examined. The natural  history drawings, ethnographic portraits, coastal profiles and landscapes that they  produced, together with the various maps and hydrographic charts that the officers  and geographers compiled, formed a rich store of iconographic material that became  just as important to the imperial project as the discursive observations to be found in  the logbooks and journals that their fellow travellers kept.3 This development had profound implications, for both the sciences and the  arts. As Bernard Smith has argued, progress in the arts not only paralleled scientific  progress but also assisted it by providing scientists with ever more accurate and  reliable visual material for analysis. Conversely, the increase in scientific knowledge of  the world constituted an 'enduring challenge to the supremacy of neo-classical values  in art and thought'.4 The artist was henceforth required to depict nature accurately,  not enhance or idealise it as the Renaissance had programmatically set out to do.  The visual imagery that scientific travellers compiled had to conform to a new ideal  3 Confirmation of this is provided by the report on Nicolas Baudin's Australian voyage  (1800-04) presented to the French government by the Institut Impérial, an extract of which  was published in François Péron's official account of the expedition, the Voyage de découvertes  aux Terres australes, vol. 1 (Paris, Imprimerie Impériale, 1807), pp. i-xv. In it, the authors,  Pierre-Simon Laplace, Louis-Antoine de Bougainville, Charles Pierre Claret de Fleurieu,  Bernard Germain de Lacépède and Georges Cuvier, note that 'une description, quelque  complète qu'elle puisse être, ne sauroit jamais donner une assez juste idée de ces formes  singulières, qui n'ont pas de terme précis de comparaison dans des objets antérieurement  connus. Des figures correctes peuvent suppléer seules à l'imperfection du discours' (p. v). 4 B. Smith, European vision and the South Pacific, 2nd edn (Sydney, Harper &amp; Row, 1985),  p. 1. The year 1768 is the starting point for Smith: in that year, the Royal Academy was  established in London and the Royal Society simultaneously undertook the promotion of  James Cook's first voyage to the South Seas. Smith observes that 'it was the empirical approach  of the Society and not the neo-classical approach of the Academy which flourished under the  impact of the new knowledge won from the Pacific' (p. 1). Smith's thesis has been immensely  influential, though it is worth noting that the various connections he established have been  challenged in more recent times. According to William Eisler, for example, 'Bernard Smith's  integration of the histories of scientific and ethnographic illustration, evolutionary thought,  and Australian art in one vast progress appears somewhat forced. I prefer to see these strands  as running parallel to each other, intersecting at various points'. See W. Eisler, The furthest  shore: Images of Terra Australis from the Middle Ages to Captain Cook (Cambridge, Cambridge  University Press, 1995), pp. 4-5. Eisler further argues in his study that the 'association of art,  science, exploration, and the "typical" landscape' was a product of the Renaissance, not of the  Enlightenment, as Smith had maintained (p. 5). 54 </page> <page sequence="3"> Framing French culture of objectivity, as illusory as we now understand that ambition to have been.5 The  pursuit of scientific knowledge thus influenced the development of artistic practices  as much as art served and impacted upon science. And, in keeping with Pratt's thesis,  in neither case were the consequences — or the motivations — entirely altruistic or  innocent. Indeed, as Sarah Thomas has observed, the intrinsic link that had developed  between 'the historically determined conventions of art and science ... formed a key  role in the colonial enterprise'.6 Reliable and precise verbal and visual information  was essential to a Europe 'obsessed with the idea that the natural world could be  classified under the one global system of nomenclature' — an obsession underpinned  by ideological assumptions and heavily motivated by political aspirations.7 Natural history drawings were thus both a symptom and an instrument of this  greater project. In order to contribute to it, they had to be as accurate as possible and  include details that would be useful for the purposes of analysis and classification.  Ethnographic portraits likewise had to convey information relating both to the  morphology of the subjects and to their social and cultural practices. And if the  artists were called upon to draw coastal profiles of the shores surveyed, these had to be  sufficiently detailed to serve the very practical purpose of assisting future navigators  in identifying their exact location. The need for precision and verisimilitude did  5 In Imagining the Pacific: In the wake of the Cook voyages (Carlton, Melbourne University  Press, 1992), Bernard Smith rightly points out that 'it would be profoundly misleading to  assume that this increased use of art for the conveyance of relevant scientific information  operated as a direct, unilinear process by which error and illusion were cast off and the truth  progressively revealed — though that certainly was the way the scientific optimists of the day  chose to regard it. Naturalism, like idealism, is a conceptualising enterprise. In moving from  the ideal theories of the academies towards the empirical standpoint of science, artists did not  thereby achieve an unvarnished truthfulness of the eye; they exchanged one conceptual master  for another' (p. 39, emphasis in the original). 6 S. Thomas, '"Beautiful to the eye or interesting to science": The conundrum of natural- history art', in S. Thomas (ed.), The encounter, 1802: Art of the Flinders and Baudin voyages  (Adelaide, Art Gallery of South Australia, 2002), p. 36. 7 Thomas, p. 18. Simon Ryan's study on the nineteenth-century land explorers of Australia  and the ideological conception of space which they helped construct, and which led to their  mythologisation, makes the same claims regarding the ultimate motives of the business  of discovery. In The cartographic eye: How explorers saw Australia (Cambridge, Cambridge  University Press, 1996), he asserts: 'The imperial endeavour encourages the construction of  space as a universal, mensurable and divisible entity, for this is a self-legitimising view of the  world. If it were admitted that different cultures produced different spaces, then negotiating  these would be difficult, if not impossible. Constructing a monolithic space, on the other  hand, allows imperialism to hierarchise the use of space to its own advantage' (p. 4). 55 </page> <page sequence="4"> Framing French culture not, however, preclude artistry or subjectivity, and the best illustrators achieved  the kind of fusion of art and science that led Bernard Smith to describe one of the  most celebrated among them — the artist on board Matthew Flinders's Investigator  expedition, Ferdinand Bauer — as 'the Leonardo of natural history illustration'.8 As  Smith explains, although Bauer 'laboured with infinite care upon detail he never lost  sight of a plant as a unified whole, so that he avoided both the dryness of science  and the sweetness of sentiment'.9 The best natural history drawing thus combines  craftsmanship and scientific accuracy with a deep aesthetic sense. While he was certainly not of the calibre of a Bauer when he left his home town  of Le Havre in October 1800 on an ambitious state-sponsored voyage of discovery  to the 'Terres Australes', Charles-Alexandre Lesueur was clearly talented enough to  have attracted the eye of the expedition's commander, Nicolas Baudin. The French  government had appointed three established artists to the expedition, but Baudin also  required illustrators for the personal journal of the voyage that he was planning to  compile, presumably with a view to publication. He therefore engaged Lesueur and  another inexperienced but equally promising artist, Nicolas-Martin Petit, for this  purpose. They were appointed officially as 'assistant gunners', but everyone on board  understood that their role was in reality to work in a quasi-private capacity for the  commander.10 Lesueur and Petit must have had a taste for adventure to sign up for  such a long and potentially perilous voyage to a little-known destination. According to  Jacqueline Bonnemains, there was even an element of risk regarding the role they would  play in this mission: 'To enlist as an assistant gunner, simply accepting the commandant's  word that they would be exempted from seamen's duties and employed as illustrators  to be paid from his private account, may well appear to be an act of pure madness'.11  8 B. Smith, 'The intellectual and artistic framework of Pacific exploration in the eighteenth  century', in W. Eisler and B. Smith (eds), Terra Australis: The furthest shore (Sydney, International  Cultural Corporation of Australia, 1988), p. 126. See also Smith, Imagining the Pacific, p. 48. 9 Smith, European vision and the South Pacific, p. 190. 10 Lesueur makes this clear in a letter addressed to his father aimed at reassuring him about  his role: 'N'ayez nulle inquiétude sur mon sort. Jusqu'à présent je suis bien avec le Capitaine  Baudin qui doit m'employer moi et d'autres de mes camarades utilement et sans être obligé  à la manœuvre du bâtiment. Notre partie sera plutôt le dessin'. See C.-A. Lesuer, Letter to  his father, Jean-Baptiste, dated 2 Fructidor Year VIII [20 August 1800], (Muséum d'Histoire  Naturelle, Le Havre, Collection Lesueur, n° 63004). 11 J. Bonnemains, 'The artists of the Baudin expedition: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur and  Nicolas-Martin Petit', in S. Thomas (ed.), The encounter, 1802: Art of the Flinders and Baudin  voyages (Adelaide, Art Gallery of South Australia, 2002), p. 128. 56 </page> <page sequence="5"> Framing French culture Baudin, too, was taking a calculated gamble in employing two such young and untried  artists to illustrate his personal journal, despite the obvious talent they each had. In the  event, however, his decision would prove to be an inspired one, as both Lesueur and  Petit would go on to produce an impressive number of accomplished drawings, many  of which have now become emblematic of the expedition. Lesueur in particular would  benefit from this formative experience, eventually carving out a successful career as both  an artist and a naturalist.12 Commentary on Lesueur's life and work has understandably focused on his  collaboration with the zoologist François Péron and on the more accomplished  illustrations he produced as a result of that partnership, both during his visit to  Australia and after his return to France. His rise to prominence once the Baudin  expedition left Mauritius, for example, has been well documented. During the  stopover in Port Louis on the journey out, the three official artists who had been  appointed by the government to accompany Baudin — the landscape painter Jacques  Milbert, the draughtsman Louis Lebrun and the genre artist Michel Garnier —  decided to abandon the expedition, ostensibly for reasons of ill health, though this  appears to have been merely a pretext.13 Their departure, in any event, created a void  that allowed Lesueur and Petit to be promoted to the status of official artists for the  expedition as it set out from Port Louis bound for New Holland.14 For Lesueur, who  12 Petit's career was tragically cut short when, on 21 October 1804, he succumbed to a  gangrenous wound sustained in a fall in a Paris street just seven months after the expedition's  return to France. 13 That was certainly the way their decision was interpreted in France, as the irony-laden report  in the Magasin encyclopédique indicates: 'Quelques-uns des dessinateurs partis avec l'expédition  du capitaine Baudin, ont trouvé si agréable le séjour de l'Île-de-France, où l'expédition a relâché,  qu'ils y ont borné le voyage autour du Monde qu'ils avoient d'abord entrepris. L'état florissant  de la Colonie, les richesses dont jouissent en général les habitans, ont mis ces artistes dans le  cas d'y exercer avec fruits leurs talens, et avec d'autant plus d'avantages, que l'éloignement de  l'Europe, privant cette île de la présence des hommes qui cultivent les arts, ils n'ont point eu de  concurrence à craindre. Il paroit que ces diverses considérations se sont réunies pour leur faire  gagner beaucoup d'argent en peu de temps. L'un d'eux a déjà, du fruit de son travail, acquis une  maison, des terres, des nègres, etc'. Magasin encyclopédique, VIIe année, VI (1801), p. 77. 14 Their promotion is recorded in Baudin's Journal de mer in an entry dated 7 Floréal Year  IX [27 April 1801], the day after the expedition's departure from Mauritius: 'je fis remplacer  sur le Géographe par les citoyens Petit et Lesueur les places qu'y occupaient inutilement Mrs  Milbert et Garnier. On jugera d'après les travaux de ces deux jeunes gens si le choix que j'en ai  fait était bon ou mauvais'. N. Baudin, Journal de mer, vol. 2 (Archives Nationales de France,  série Marine 5JJ37), p. 76. 57 </page> <page sequence="6"> Framing French culture had begun to show some talent for natural history drawing, this meant working more  closely with the scientists after the stopover in Mauritius, and in particular with the  zoologist François Péron, whose own status had improved radically following the  desertion of several of his more senior colleagues during their stay on the island. As  Lesueur's biographers have rightly observed, Péron would have a decisive influence  on Lesueur's evolution as a natural history illustrator. Jacqueline Bonnemains, in  pointing to the 'rôle immense de François Péron dans la carrière de Charles-Alexandre  Lesueur', explains: 'C'est lui, en effet, qui le forma à l'étude zoologique lui permettant  ainsi d'y faire valoir tout son talent artistique'.15 This collaboration with Péron was not  only instrumental in making Lesueur a better natural history artist; it also developed  in him an enduring taste for natural history itself. As Bonnemains notes: Leur collaboration est des plus efficaces, l'un dessinant avec précision et talent  ce que l'autre décrit et détermine. Mais, très vite, Lesueur devient plus qu'un  artiste. Les rangs des naturalistes s'éclaircissent: le scorbut, la dysenterie,  les fièvres s'installent, soit en mer, soit au cours des escales et sont fatals à  beaucoup. C'est alors que Lesueur, avec son ami Péron, récolte, observe, prépare  et naturalise les animaux marins ou terrestres de ces lointaines régions.16 Lesueur's scientific activities and the drawings he produced later in his career, both  during the twenty-two years he spent in the United States (1815-37), where he mixed  and worked with such luminaries as the philanthropic geologist William Maclure and  the utopian socialist Robert Owen, and in the last decade of his life back in Le Havre  (1837-46), where he was eventually appointed the founding director of the newly  created Museum of Natural History in 1846, have likewise been well documented.17 15 J.

More specifically, a study of these early  drawings will serve to highlight some of the characteristics of Lesueur's style and  of the particular aesthetic he was developing at the very beginning of what we  might describe as his 'professional' career. Comparisons with his later work — the  more orthodox scientific illustrations he would go on to complete, as well as the  sketches of people and places he would continue to draw throughout his life —  will further allow us to determine the extent to which the stylistic and aesthetic  features exhibited in his early drawings might be seen as enduring and defining  characteristics of his œuvre. Finally, a consideration of these early drawings will also  provide us with a better understanding of the place that drawing occupied for him,  both during the expedition and in his life more generally. One of the unfortunate consequences of neglecting these early sketches and  drawings and focusing instead on the artwork that Lesueur produced during his time  in Australia and beyond is that the importance of his early training and development  as an artist is often overlooked. It is almost to imply that, until he began to work  in close collaboration with the scientists on the expedition, he had not begun to  develop his own aesthetic, his own way of seeing the world. There is admittedly  little documentary evidence to help us identify what his early influences might have  been. We do know, thanks to the efforts of his biographers, most notably Jacqueline  Bonnemains, that his early training was most likely in the field of hydrography and  Harmony, s.n., 1999). On his life and work in Le Havre, see Ph. Manneville and S. Barot,  'Charles-Alexandre Lesueur et Le Havre', in A. Dommergues and M. Nedeljkovic (eds), Les  Français et l'Australie: Voyages de découvertes et missions scientifiques de 1756 à nos jours (Paris,  Université Paris X Nanterre, 1989), pp. 99-105. 18 One notable exception is Jean Fornasiero's account of the circumstances in which  Lesueur and Petit produced their work on board the ship during the early part of the voyage:  'Charles-Alexandre Lesueur: An art of the littoral', in J. Fornasiero and V. Thwaites (eds),  Littoral (Adelaide, s.n., 2010), pp. 12-19. 59 </page> <page sequence="8"> Framing French culture naval draughtsmanship.19 Born in 1778 into a lower-middle-class family from Le  Havre, where his father worked at the Admiralty, as his grandfather had also done,  the young Charles-Alexandre attended the local College and then in all likelihood  went, with his cousins, to the School of Hydrography. This is where midshipmen  were trained in the basic skills of that art, but the School also offered free classes in  draughtsmanship and applied graphic techniques. Lesueur's early training was thus of  a technical nature and would have developed in him a sense of precision and a keen  eye for detail. We can assume, from the fact that Baudin hired him, that Lesueur  had already demonstrated some talent for this kind of drawing, and perhaps also for  artistic drawing more generally. The young twenty-two-year-old artist therefore had  at least one of the qualities required to become an accomplished natural history artist:  a meticulous attention to detail. But technical ability alone does not make a great artist. Precision and accuracy  will produce perfectly acceptable maps and charts, but they are not in and of  themselves sufficient when it comes to drawing animate objects. Contemplation of  another living object — a plant, an animal or, particularly, another human being —  always induces in us a mix of responses which are a sign that we are interacting with  that object: that we are investing it with meaning, engaging with it on our own  personal terms. The paradox of good natural history art is that, at the same time as it  purports to provide an objectively accurate depiction of the object under study which  satisfies our intellectual requirements, it also expresses the artist's subjective vision  and produces in the viewer a subtle but sure emotional response. Some might argue that, even in his later drawings, Lesueur sometimes struggled  to find that delicate balance between the intellectual and the emotional: that he did  not always avoid the excesses of both. We can see from his early drawings, in any  case, that his gaze already had a strongly personal dimension that competed with his  primarily technical training. There is a whimsy, for example, in his choice of subjects.  One particularly compelling set of images is the series of cloud drawings that Lesueur  made, most notably when he crossed the Equator.20 19 For more detail on Lesueur's early life and training, see Bonnemains, Les Artistes du  'Voyage de découvertes aux Terres australes', pp. 17-18. The brief outline presented here is based  on that biographical study. 20 For obvious practical reasons, only a selection of Lesueur's drawings can be reproduced  here. The most complete catalogue of his work is to be found in the illustrated biography  produced by G. Baglione and C. Crémière, Charles-Alexandre Lesueur: Peintre voyageur, un  trésor oublié (Paris, Éditions de Conti, 2009). 60 </page> <page sequence="9"> Framing French culture Figure 3.1: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, Sketches of clouds made on board the  Géographe at or near the Equator.

The fact that they correspond to  different moments of the day, and that he drew most of them at or near the symbolic  latitude of the Equator, might suggest an emerging scientific curiosity about natural  phenomena. It is nevertheless hard to imagine that these drawings would have served  any particular scientific purpose, beyond the anecdotal recording of the state of the  sky at that latitude and at the given time of day and year. What dominates in these  drawings is the fascination of the artist with light, shape and form, especially when  we view them as a set. This keen interest in shape and form would remain a feature of  Lesueur's work, as demonstrated by his later illustrations of jellyfish and starfish, for  example, or by his depictions of the cliffs around Le Havre. We can therefore see it as  constituting one of the enduring and defining aspects of his aesthetic. The cloud drawings also point to Lesueur's willingness —and ability — to  take on technical challenges. Clouds are a particularly difficult subject for any artist,  not just because of their mobile nature but also because they test the artist's skill in  depicting volume, perspective and nuances of shade and light. As no less an artist  than John Constable observed in 1821, at a time when his own obsession with skies  had led him to focus almost exclusively on sky and cloud studies, the 'difficulty  [of skies] in painting is very great, both as to composition and execution'.21 These  technical challenges — the elusive and changing shape of the subject, the difficulty of  depicting nuances of colour and of portraying specific details in accurate perspective  and proportion — are not limited to clouds. They are in fact very similar to the  challenges Lesueur confronted when he came to draw the jellyfish caught by Péron  and the other scientists during the Baudin expedition. It is true that his execution of  such illustrations improved over time, but the technical ability and the methodical  patience exhibited in Lesueur's later, more accomplished, zoological illustrations are  already in evidence in his early cloud drawings. Finally, the cloud sketches point to yet another constant in Lesueur's work, and  that is his emotional engagement with his subject, which complements the intellectual  demands of objective observation. Constable, who understood the vital role clouds  play in expressing the mood of a scene, considered the sky to be the 'key note' of  21 Letter from Constable to his friend John Fisher dated 23 October 1821, reproduced  in J.E. Thornes, John Constable's skies: A fusion of art and science (Edgbaston, University of  Birmingham Press, 1999), p. 57. 62 </page> <page sequence="11"> Framing French culture any landscape and 'the chief "Organ of sentiment"'.22 Lesueur's cloud drawings may  not have the evocative power of a Constable sky, but they nevertheless convey a  strong sense of emotion — the aesthetic emotion of the artist, no doubt, but also the  emotional response created in him by the particular circumstances in which he found  himself: on a ship in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean in unfamiliar latitudes and in  atmospheric conditions that he was experiencing for the first time. There is a sense  of moment here, most notably in the cloud drawings from the Equator. Crossing the  line was a significant event for any maritime traveller, let alone a young man engaged  in his first sea voyage. It is therefore entirely plausible that Lesueur was using these  drawings as a means both to record his personal milestone and to express something  of his emotional response to that moment. The numerous sketches Lesueur made during the passage from Le Havre  to Mauritius of sailors and others going about their business on board the ship  represent another important group of early drawings. Perhaps in one sense Lesueur  was simply rehearsing his art, as a musician practises scales, or as his Normandy  compatriot Eugène Boudin would later hone his skills through endlessly painting  cows. The comparison is not entirely factitious if we consider the unfinished quality  of many of Boudin's cow paintings: at a certain point, the artist must have felt that  he had sufficiently 'warmed up' to move on to new and more challenging subjects. In  Lesueur's case, however, these sketches also constitute a kind of diary of his voyage. These sketches have an intimate and whimsical quality that is reminiscent of his  cloud drawings. Lesueur spent several months in close and confined contact with the  men he depicts here, and sketching them was perhaps a way of expressing his personal  connection with the routine work they had to undertake around him and with some  of the more idiosyncratic forms of behaviour they displayed.23 The inclusion of the  odd accessory, in sketches that are generally short on such detail, also gives us the  sense of a strongly personalised perception of his travelling companions and of ship- board life: the cannon, the cup and carafe, the duck in its cage, the sailor's bell,  for example (Figures 3.6 and 3.7). The character that may be lacking in their facial  expressions is nevertheless suggested in other ways — by their pose, for example, or  by the lived-in quality of the clothes they are wearing. In aesthetic terms, these rapidly  drawn sketches that are 'pris sur le vif' have the unfinished quality characteristic of  22 See Thornes, p. 57. 23 For other examples, see Baglione and Crémière, pp. 37 and 39. 63 </page> <page sequence="12"> Framing French culture Figure 3.2: Charles-Alexandre Figure 3.3: Charles-Alexandre  Lesueur, Portrait possibly of Lesueur, Voilier sur le Géographe.

This would remain a feature of many of Lesueur's later pencil sketches —  during his boat trips down the Ohio and the Mississippi, for example, when he  sketched people likewise going about their work.24 There is even a kinship in this  respect with some of the pencil and watercolour sketches depicting the places he  visited, whether it be Sydney Town, Philadelphia, New Harmony, New Orleans or  Le Havre.25 In most cases, Lesueur did not intend to use such sketches as a basis for  final, more finished, pieces of work, and they were therefore not a means of working  out ideas. He was simply recording what he saw and compiling a kind of visual diary  of the people he met and the places he visited. The drawings we have examined thus far are of a very personal nature — that is  to say, they are of subjects that Lesueur chose and that reflect his own particular interests  and experiences. He was, however, hired to illustrate the commander's personal journal,  and that involved drawing subjects of natural history at Baudin's request. Lesueur  completed many such drawings during the outward journey, primarily of fish and other  marine animals — a choice no doubt dictated by the circumstances, though it should  be noted that marine life, particularly the smaller and more unusual animals, held a  particular fascination for the commander. The specimens Lesueur and Petit drew were  pulled up from the sea during the voyage using a net that the zoologists René Maugé  and Stanislas Levillain had specially designed for this purpose, and it was Baudin who  decided which specimen he wanted drawn for his journal. It is possible that Maugé and  Levillain also had some input into the illustrations; Levillain's notebooks, for example,  contain zoological descriptions that, as Jean Fornasiero has pointed out, 'are clearly  linked to Lesueur's paintings of some of these very animals'.26 However, the relative lack  of scientific detail they provide suggests either that the input of Levillain and Maugé  was not as detailed or as technical as Péron's would later prove to be, or else that the  visual and textual records were compiled more or less separately or perhaps sequentially  24 See Baglione and Crémière, pp. 296-9. 25 In addition to the images reproduced here, see Baglione and Crémière, pp. 56-7 (Île de  France), 79 and 93 (Kupang), 123 (Port Jackson), 156 (Cape Town), 194-215 and 220-2  (various locations in France), 230-3, 248-9 and 331-7 (Le Havre), 270-5 (northeast United  States), 279-84 (Philadelphia), 286-9 (New Harmony), and 345-9 (the Cap de la Hève near  Le Havre). 26 Fornasiero, p. 16. 66 </page> <page sequence="15"> Framing French culture Figure 3.8: Charles-Alexandre Lesueur, Sketch drawn during the sojourn in Port  Jackson.

Despite their scientific shortcomings, however, these drawings made quite an  impression on anyone who cared to go and look at them (Baudin was perfectly happy  to have his illustrated log put on display for all to see). The zoologist Bory de Saint- Vincent, who travelled on Baudin's consort ship, the Naturaliste, was most taken by these  illustrations when he had the chance to look at them during the stopover in Mauritius: En attendant qu'il nous fût permis d'aller à terre, je parcourus avec admiration  le journal du commandant: c'était un immense volume cartonné, étalé sur  une table dans son appartement, et auquel il paraissait qu'on pouvait toucher  sans indiscrétion, car Riedlay [Riedlé] et Maugé le feuilletaient sans façon, et  en faisaient les honneurs aux étrangers. Ce journal renfermait une multitude  de figures de mollusques, de poissons, ou d'autres objets d'histoire naturelle,  peints avec une perfection et une vérité dont rien n'approche. Je regrettai que  ces dessins n'eussent pas été dirigés par un naturaliste; ils auraient pu par-là  devenir complets; mais il n'y avait nuls détails anatomiques; le peintre n'avait pas  toujours représenté l'animal par le côté qui offrait ses caractères; et comme aucune  description linnéenne si l'on peut s'exprimer ainsi, n'accompagnait ces figures,  elles n'auront pas, si elles sont jamais gravées, le mérite qu'elles eussent dû avoir,  sur-tout pour les zoologistes des contrées éloignées de la mer, qui ne prendront  pas toujours par elles une idée exacte de ce qu'elles représentent. Pour moi qui  venais de voir les objets représentés, et qui avais eu en même tems la prétention  de les peindre avec vérité, je fus surpris et confus en parcourant ces chefs-d'œuvre,  et je me hâtai de m'informer quel était l'auteur d'un si bel ouvrage, afin de lui  témoigner la satisfaction que j'en éprouvais; on me présenta un jeune homme  d'un air très-modeste, et qui, par un noble zèle, s'était embarqué comme novice- timonier, quoique digne d'entrer dans une expédition scientifique d'une manière  bien plus utile aux progrès des arts; on avait découvert son talent à bord, et le  commandant l'avait employé.

We  know from the commander's comments that Petit was responsible for at least some of  these drawings29, but Bory's remarks indicate that whoever responded to his inquiry  considered they were primarily the work of one man. It is important to note that,  as Bory himself makes clear, he had to rely on others for information regarding this  artistic work. He had travelled in Baudin's consort ship, the Naturaliste, and had  therefore only become aware of it on the expedition's arrival in Mauritius. A further  degree of circumspection is warranted given the two factual errors Bory makes in his  account of this episode. As already noted, Lesueur, like Petit, was engaged as an 'aide- canonnier', not as a 'timonier', and his talent was not discovered during the course of  the voyage but had already been identified by Baudin before the departure from Le  Havre, which is when the commander hired both of the young artists.30 Interestingly, François Péron, in a draft letter to the Professors at the Museum  praising their work, states that one (Petit) devoted himself to coastal views and  ethnographic drawings whereas the other (Lesueur) focused on natural history. This,  however, is something of a simplification and provides only a guide as to the division  of labour between them. As Jacqueline Bonnemains reminds us, while Péron is largely  justified in his description of their respective duties, 28 Bonnemains, Les Artistes du 'Voyage de découvertes aux Terres australes', p. 44. Her  characterisation is based on François Péron's anecdote regarding Petit's interactions with the  Tasmanian Aborigines. 29 Baudin writes: 'Les dessins coloriés qui se trouvent dans mon journal, exécutés par les  citoyens Martin Petit et Lesueur ne laissent rien à désirer pour la régularité et l'exactitude'. See  J. Bonnemains (ed.), Mon voyage aux Terres Australes: Journal personnel du commandant Baudin  illustré par Lesueur et Petit (Paris, Imprimerie Nationale, 2000), p. 137. 30 It is also possible that Bory was deliberately misrepresenting the situation in order  to deprive Baudin of his due credit for hiring these two artists. On Bory's key role in the  campaign to undermine Baudin's reputation, see J. Fornasiero and J. West-Sooby, 'Doing  it by the book: Breaking the reputation of Nicolas Baudin', in J. Fornasiero and C. Mrowa- Hopkins (eds), Explorations and encounters in French (Adelaide, University of Adelaide Press,  2010), pp. 142-6. 70 </page> <page sequence="19"> Framing French culture in practice their work was not as clearly separated ... There will therefore  always remain some doubt about the attribution of the unsigned drawings to  one or other of these two artists, although their different styles allow certain  conclusions to be drawn.31 A thorough stylistic analysis would indeed be useful in attempting to identify  the authorship of the various illustrations that figured in Baudin's personal journal.  While that kind of detailed analysis is beyond the scope of our discussion here,  it is nevertheless instructive to consider a sample of these early natural history  drawings, as they display certain characteristics that can be seen to have a kinship  with Lesueur's later zoological work — even if it remains a moot point for the  time being whether this kinship constitutes evidence of Lesueur's authorship  or, alternatively, is the sign of an aesthetic that he and Petit jointly explored and  developed.32 The natural history drawings that made the commander's journal such an  object of admiration were certainly, as Bory laments, deficient in terms of scientific  detail. They are nevertheless remarkable for their expressivity and the emotional  response they suggest on the part of the artist. These are not the drawings of a cold  and indifferent observer. Some of the fish paintings, for example, give us a keen  sense of the artist's engagement with his subject.33 The fish have something of a  startled look, perhaps reflecting the response of the artist to such unusual specimens  of marine life. This would remain a feature of many of his later fish illustrations  — his drawings of the Moorish idol (Zanclus canescens), for example, or of the  red lionfish (Pterois volitans).34 Interestingly, one of the defining traits of Lesueur's  later drawings of Australian mammals would likewise be their anthropomorphic  31 J. Bonnemains, 'The artists of the Baudin expedition', in J. Bonnemains, E. Forsyth  and B. Smith (eds), Baudin in Australian waters: The artwork of the French voyage of discovery  to the southern lands 1800-1804 (Melbourne, Oxford University Press in association with the  Australian Academy of the Humanities, 1988), p. 17. 32 In a new book by the current custodians of the Lesueur Collection and their collaborators  the authors state that, when Lesueur was named official artist for the expedition after the  sojourn in Mauritius, Petit was his 'assistant'. This suggests that Baudin saw Lesueur as having  the more senior status of the two and perhaps adds some weight to the argument that he was  primarily responsible for the drawings in the commander's journal — and for the aesthetic  features they exhibit.

The fact that Lesueur could execute such drawings at all is something of an  exploit.

Rien à voir avec la finesse des observations notées sur les vélins que  Lesueur peignit par la suite'. Bonnemains (ed.), plate VII. 74 </page> <page sequence="23"> Framing French culture There is indeed an unfamiliar and alien quality to these animals that has both  drawn the artist in and forced him to take his distance from them. And this counter- response of detachment may be one reason why, in aesthetic terms, these illustrations  take on an almost abstract quality. The artist, having been drawn in by the alluring  features of these animals, has then found himself compelled by questions of form.  This fascination with form, above and beyond any scientific considerations, was  a feature of Lesueur's drawings of clouds and would remain a key element of his  later work — his drawings of starfish (Figure 3.16) or sea squirts (Figure 3.17), for  example, or the various composite drawings in which he carefully grouped specimens  of the same animal in order to create a more general collective shape (Figure 3.18).40  In these composite illustrations in particular, but also in the series of drawings he  devoted to starfish and jellyfish, the emphasis on form and composition is such that  it distracts the viewer from seeing the specimens depicted as animals. They begin to  lose their status as living creatures and instead become abstractions that fascinate us  more for their shape and the way the artist has arranged them than for their zoological  properties. This is as true of the early drawings (Figure 3.15, for example) as for  Lesueur's later work, and is thus a key element of his aesthetic.

Le Havre, Muséum d'Histoire Naturelle, Collection Lesueur, n° 72019. 76 </page> <page sequence="25"> Framing French culture We have already noted that, as the journey progressed, and especially once the  expedition reached Australian waters, Lesueur came to work more and more closely  with the scientists, and in particular with the zoologist François Péron. This close  association with Péron, which soon evolved into an enduring friendship, led Lesueur  to take a different path from that followed by his fellow artist, Petit, both in terms of  the subject matter in which each would specialise and with respect to the particular  aesthetic each would develop. Lesueur's zoological drawings naturally became more  'professional', in the sense that he learned how best to depict his subjects for scientific  analysis.41 Through his art, he would therefore contribute in no small way to the  scientific success of an expedition which, in Martin Terry's colourful expression, was  'the zenith of France's sense of omnium gatherum'.42 Nevertheless, Lesueur's subsequent drawings retained many of the features  we have identified in his early sketches as well as in many of the unattributed  illustrations included in Baudin's personal journal: the warm and intimate rapport  with the subject, a kind of whimsical gaze, the expression of emotion and subjectivity,  a tendency towards anthropomorphism, and a fascination with shape and form that  gives many of the drawings a certain abstract quality. In contrast to the posed and  almost serene sophistication of Ferdinand Bauer's natural history drawings, Lesueur's  finished illustrations have a 'dynamic vivacity' which for Martin Terry 'owes much to  the even earlier traditions of Dürer and Hoffmann' — traditions which, ironically,  Lesueur may have become more aware of thanks to his meetings with the Austrian  Bauer in Sydney in 1802.43 That spontaneous and dynamic style is, as we have seen,  also evident in Lesueur's early and less finished pieces, and is likewise a feature of the  various zoological illustrations in Baudin's journal, many of which he painted. 41 See, for example, his later paintings of jellyfish depicting different views, including cross- sections (Baglione and Crémière, pp. 99 and 124), or his drawing of a platypus skeleton  (p. 116). 42 M. Terry, 'Terre Napoléon', in W. Eisler and B. Smith (eds), Terra Australis: The furthest  shore (Sydney, International Cultural Corporation of Australia, 1988), p. 156. As Terry  adds: 'An almost obsessive quality is present in the rigour of its [France's] confiscatory and  classificatory impulses'. 43 Terry, p. 155. Susan Hunt goes so far as to suggest that Lesueur's drawings of Australia's  exotic animals and birds, for all the 'extraordinary precision and painstaking skill' they display,  are nevertheless quite distinct from the work of other natural history artists because of their  'bizarre violence' (p. 12). 77 </page> <page sequence="26"> Framing French culture What this suggests is that, in reality, Lesueur's way of seeing never changed: his  skill as an artist undoubtedly improved, but his aesthetic remained constant. When  he was not simply sketching in order to keep a kind of personal diary of the places he  visited and the scenes he witnessed, Lesueur learned to discipline his art for scientific  purposes; but he remained, throughout, true to his personal style. Indeed, as some of  his later sketches demonstrate, he was not afraid to return to a more spontaneous and  raw expression of it when the mood struck.44 Perhaps, then, this enduring attachment  to his own particular aesthetic, as expressed in the various stages of his evolution, was  his way of telling us that, despite the respect he had for science, and despite all the  learning he himself had acquired, he was first and foremost an artist.
