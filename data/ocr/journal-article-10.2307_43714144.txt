Pp. xiv + 187. Paper, n.p. This study of Mt 28:16-20 is a doctoral dissertation accepted by the Graduate College of the University of Iowa in 1973. Dr. Hubbard argues that the passage conforms to the structure of a "Hebrew Bible Commissioning Gattung ' such as is found in at least 27 passages in the Jewish Scriptures, e.g., Gen 11:28-30; 12:1 -4a; Jos 1:1-1 1; Jer 1:1-10; 1 Chr 22:1-16. According to H., this Gattung is characterized by the following seven elements: (1) circumstantial Introduction , (2) Confrontation between the commissioner and the commissioned, (3) Reaction to the presence of deity, (4) Commission proper, (5) Protest at the commission, (6) Reassurance from the deity, (7) Conclusion. How- ever, item 3 is frequently lacking, and item 5 is occasionally absent (see chart p. 65). Mt 28:16-20 is said to fit this form even though items 5 and 7 are omitted- the absence of the Conclusion is discussed on p. 7 1 f . H. then argues that a common tradition underlies the commissioning scenes at the end of all four gospels (Mt 28:16-20; (Pseudo) Mk 16:14-20; Lk 24:36-53; Jn 20:19-23); and that this common tradition included the Confrontation (Jesus appeared to the eleven), the Reaction (when they saw him they were glad, though some disbelieved), the Commission itself (preach to all nations, [baptize] in my name for the forgiveness of sins) and the Reassurance (I will send the Holy Spirit upon you). This proto-commission</page><page sequence="2">1 08 The Catholic Biblical Quarterly [Vol. 38 narrative must have originated during the first 15-20 years after the resurrection, presumably shaped by someone involved in the Gentile mission who knew the earlier tradition about the appearance to the eleven. In Mt 28:16-20 this proto-commissioning narrative has been further redacted in the direction of the Hebrew Bible Commissioning Gattung. In an appendix (pp. 137-149) H. argues that (Pseudo) Mk 16: 15f. may well reflect the proto-commission material even though the rest of 16:9-20 is borrowed principally from the other three gospels. In a further appendix (pp. 151-175), the Eusebian evidence for the short baptismal formula is rejected as inadequate, and H. supports the view that the triadic formula was introduced into the narrative by the evangelist himself because it reflected the practice of his own community. It is plausible to argue, developing the discussions of Kuntz, Habel and Baltzer, that there was a commission Gattung with approximately the seven items listed above. Certainly Mt 28:16-20 may be fitted into this pattern. The sceptic, however, may ask whether even these seven items are sufficiently distinctive to justify the claim for a special Gattung. Would not most of them appear in almost any narrative in which an authoritative X meets Y for a significant exchange? Except for the Commission itself, would not this pattern fit other narratives such as Luke 1:5-23 or 1:29-38 or 2:8-15? Admittedly these narratives are in a sense related to "commissioning" narrative, but H. has argued for a specific commissioning Gattung as over against a theophany or angelophany Gattung. (It is interesting to note that John Alsup in The Post- Resurrection Appearance Stories of the Gospel Tradition , 1975, relates the ap- pearance narratives - including Mt 28:16-20 - to the "anthropomorphic theophany" presentations in the Hebrew Bible). Admittedly it is difficult to be certain when a given pattern reflects an established literary pattern and when it reflects simply the inner dynamic of the material itself. It must be conceded that H.'s identification of specific phrases or motifs that recur in his commissioning narratives strengthens his argument for the influence of a definite Gattung. This is further supported by his argument that Matthew redacted the proto-commissioning narrative in the direction of the form characteristic of the Hebrew Bible. A minor questionable point: H. notes (pp. 63f.) that 17 out of the 27 Hebrew Bible narratives have either the Reaction item or the Protest , but that only 5 include both items. He suggests there was a tendency for the Gattung to include one or the other of these items but not both. The statistical evidence may be read somewhat differently. Of the 8 narratives that contain the Reaction , 5 include also the Protest , i.e., just over half. On the other hand, of the 1 9 narratives that do not contain the Reaction , 8(9) do not have the Protest either, i.e., just under half. Thus, if the Reaction is included, there is slightly more chance of the Protest being included also. Despite general questions that may remain about the identification of the Gattung , and specific questions about some details, this dissertation is a model of clarity. It is forcefully and logically presented, and includes extensive bibliographic data bringing the reader into touch with relevant current discussions. Would that these qualities were present in all doctoral theses! The Hartford Seminary Foundation , Hartford , Conn. HARvtY K. McArthur</page></plain_text>
