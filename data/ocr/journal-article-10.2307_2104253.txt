<plain_text><page sequence="1">"DEUS, SIVE NATURA ..." In the well-known short story by Frank Stockton, the reader is left to decide which came out: the lady or the tiger. In similar fashion, the reader of Spinoza is left with the question: what finally emerges from the web of definitions, postulates, and propositions? Is it naturalism? Or super- naturalism ? Is Spinoza a hideous atheist ? Or a God-intoxicated man ? The present essay is an examination of Spinoza's conceptions of God and of the human soul. It seeks to demonstrate that Spinoza holds God to be conscious (or supra-conscious) and the human personality to survive the death of the body, and that, therefore, Spinoza cannot properly be called a naturalist. 1 We shall proceed by stating the case for a naturalistic interpretation and then show that such an interpretation is untenable. The evidence for a naturalistic interpretation of Spinoza's conception of Deity rests upon the following considerations: In Ethics, Part I, Proposition XVI, Spinoza proves that "From the necessity of the divine nature infinite numbers of things in infinite ways... must follow. "2 To say that God exists and operates by the necessity of his nature is to deny that God has anthropomorphic characters. It is to deny that God may properly be conceived after the analogy of a king or a judge. 3 Neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God. 4 God does not act from freedom of the will. 5 And, strictly speaking, God loves or hates no one. 6 Then, in Book IV of the Ethics, Spinoza identifies God with Nature. And this identification is made strikingly explicit in three passages in the Theologico-political Tractate, viz.: Nature herself is the power of God under another name, and our ignorance of the power of God is coextensive with our ignorance of Nature. It is absolute folly, 1 It is not necessary for the purposes of this paper to give a positive definition of "naturalism." As we are using the term, no one is a naturalist who believes either (1) that the deity is conscious (or supra-conscious), or (2) that the individual personality survives the death of the body. 2 The idea that God operates eX necessitate divinae naturae is repeated in Ethic8, I, Prop. XXIX and Scholium; Ethics, I, Appendix I, paragraph 1, and in Letters LXXV, p. 31, and XLIII, p. 223. All references are to the pagination of Gebhardt, Spinoza Opera, Heidelberg, n.d.

So that to say that everything happens according to natural laws, and to say that everything is ordained by the decree and ordinance of God, is the same thing ... the power in nature is identical with the power of God. 8 ... the providence of God means nothing but nature's order following necessarily from her eternal laws. 9 From these passages, we may conclude that Spinoza is a naturalist 10 and that any passages which appear to indicate otherwise may be interpret- ed either (1) by saying that Spinoza uses the traditional supernaturalist Mediaeval terminology to express his radically new naturalistic thought (i.e., "old words with new meanings") or (2) by admitting that there are in Spinoza's writings a few anachronistic survivals of his childhood piety. 11 Such is the case for a naturalist interpretation. I shall now try to show that none of the above passages requires - not even prime face - a naturalistic interpretation and that, in fact, taken in context, all the above statements require a non-naturalist interpretation. The concept of a God existing and operating ex necessitate divinae naturae is, of course, incompatible with a theistic conception of a deity who creates arbitrarily and who miraculously intervenes in the course of nature. But this notion of an impersonal (or supra-personal) deity is found in many non-naturalist philosophies. While the Jewish, Muslim, and Christian mediaeval philosophers and mystics never quite got beyond the notion of God's will, their conception of God's causality was virtually the same as Spinoza's. 12 And in Neo-Platonism in the West and in Vedanta and Mahayana Buddhism in the East, the notion exists of a Godhead comple- tely beyond will and personality. The notion that neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God is found in Thomas Aquinas 13 and, indeed, in any theology where the via 7 Theologico-political Tractate, p. 28. 8 Ibid., pp. 45-46. 9 Ibid., p. 82. 10 There is no real textual basis for a naturalistic construing of Spinoza's conception of immortality. The assertion that Spinoza did not teach individual immortality is either (1) a deduction from his assumed general naturalism, or (2) an erroneous inference from Ethics, V, Prop. XXXIV, Schol. See below. 11 In other words, as Wolfson puts it, Spinoza's reputed God intoxication is nothing but a hang-over of an earlier religious jag. (Harry Austryn Wolfson, The Philo8ophy of Spinoza, Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1948, Vol.11, p. 348). 12 Cf. Wolfson, op. cit., I, pp. 302-18; II, pp. 345-46. Gershom G.

Frank, Philo8ophical Undertanding and Religious Truth, p. 54.</page><page sequence="3">514 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH negative prevails. 14 The identification of God with nature (natura naturans) is found in Thomas Aquinas and John Scotus Erigena. 15 And Neo-ortho- dox theologian Paul Tillich insists that the laws of nature cannot be in any way impeached by supernatural miracles. 16 The Deus, sive natura formula does not of itself mean that God is merely nature. It merely means that God does not interfere with nature, that there are no miraculous inter- ventions; it does not rule out the possibility that God is a supraconscious, supra-personal being Who loves man and with Whom man may have eternal communion. In short, these passages need not be interpreted naturalistically. If we look at these "naturalistic" passages in context, we see that, in fact, they cannot be interpreted naturalistically. The argument by which Spinoza establishes that God operates from the necessity of his nature is that only such a God is perfect. Such a line of reasoning is incompre- hensible in a naturalist metaphysics. 17 The assertion that neither intellect nor will pertain to God is made by Spinoza to safeguard the majesty and transcendence of Deity. God's intellect and will are so far above ours that they have only the name in common. 18 Nowhere in the argument does Spinoza ever suggest that the human mind is the culmination of Nature, the bursting into consciousness of an otherwise unconscious elan vital. Moreover, in numerous passages, Spinoza asserts that God is a thinking thing, 19 and that the human mind is part of an infinite power of thin- king. 20 In all these the consciousness of God is either stated or implied. And there are also the passages in Ethics, Book V, dealing with God's infinite intellectual love. But before we get to them, we must deal more 14 Cf. Alan W. Watts, Myth and Ritual in Christianity (London, Thames and Hudson, 1954), pp. 60-61, 68, for analysis of via negative in Eastern and Western theology. Cf. Frank, op.cit., pp. 53-54. Cf. Scholem, loc.ceit. Even when the via analogia is used, theologians are careful to emphasize that "will" and "intellect" are not predicated univocally of God and man (by definition, of course). Thus Paul Tillich, Systematic Theology, p. 239, says: all assertions about God are only symbolic and that "both will and intellect in their application to God express infinitely more than the mental acts of willing and understanding as these appear in human experience. They are symbols for dynamics ... and ... form as the meaningful structure of being-itself." 15 Cf. Wolfson, op.cit., pp. 253-55. 16 Cf. Tillich, op.cit., pp. 115-117. 17 This might be unfair. I suppose a naturalist could (following the principle of "old words with new meanings") say that God's perfection merely means that God is "all there is" and that "all there is" obviously operates the way it operates, i.e., from the necessity of its nature. 18 The argument and the very illustration of the Dogstar and the dog that barks were standard mediaeval fare.

And to do this we must discuss briefly Spinoza's conception of the two orders of existence and the three types of knowledge. Spinoza introduces, explicitly, the notion of the two orders of existence in Ethics, Book II, Prop. VIII, Cor.: ... when individual things do not exist unless in so far as they are comprehended in the attributes of God, their objective being or ideas do not exist unless in so far as the infinite idea of God exists; and when individual things are said to exist, not only in so far as they are included in God's attributes, but in so far as they are said to have duration, their ideas involve the existence through which they are said to have duration. Then, in Book II, Prop. XLV, Scholium: By 'existence' is to be understood here not duration, that is, existence in the abstrac as if it were a certain kind of quantity, but I speak of the nature itself of the existen- ce which is assigned to individual things, because from the eternal necessity of the nature of God infinite numbers of things follow in infinite ways. I repeat, that I speak of the existence itself of individual things in so far as they are in God. For although each individual thing is determined by another individual thing to ex- istence in a certain way, the force, nevertheless, by which each thing perseveres in its existence follows from the eternal necessity of the nature of God. Finally, in Book V, Prop. XXIX, Scholium: Things are conceived by us as actual in two ways either in so far as we conceive them to exist with relation to a fixed time and place or in so far as we conceive them to be contained in God and to follow from the necessity of the divine nature. But those things which are conceived in this second way as true or real we conceive under the form of eternity, and their ideas involve the eternal and infinite essence of God. 21 The great bulk of the statements in Parts II, III, and IV of the Ethics are concerned with the type of existence called "duration" or "existence determined in a certain way" or "existence with relation to a fixed time and place." All of Spinoza's so-called Naturalism appears in connection with the analysis of this type of existence. The equation of God and Nature, indeed, the very term "Nature," appears only in connection with this type of existence. 22 21 It lies beyond the scope of this paper to determine exactly what Spinoza means by these two ways of existence, or how they are related to, say, Schopenhauer's conceptions of the Idea and the idea (below the principle of sufficient reason), or to Leibniz's con- ceptions of monads and material 8ecunda or phenomena bene fundata, or to Kant's con- ceptions of noumena and phenomena. 22 The only time the term "Nature" appears in the propositional structure of Part V, the latter part of which deals with the other type of existence, is to indicate (Proposition XXXVII) that the laws of Nature are irrelevant to this type of existence.</page><page sequence="5">516 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH The aggregation (or organic unity) of the modes and their relationships constitute the "order of nature," 23 "the whole of nature," 24 the "common order of nature," 25 or the "order of the whole of nature." 26 It is with respect to this type of existence alone that Spinoza says: The essence of man does not involve necessary existence; that is to say, the ex- istence as well as the non-existence of this or that man may or may not follow from the order of nature. 27 and that: There is no individual thing in Nature which is not surpassed in strength and power by some other thing, but any individual thing being given, another and a stronger is also given by which the former can be destroyed. 28 This spatio-temporal existence is correlated with the first type of knowledge: sense-perception, imagination, memory, and abstract (or empirical) knowledge. 29 The first type of knowledge alone tells us of the spatio-temporal relations of individual things, about what Spinoza calls the "accidental properties,, 30 or "extrinsic denominations," "relations," or "circumstances" of individual things, which are "very different from their inmost essence." 31 The second type of knowledge, Reason, consists of the "common notions" of the common properties of things, i.e., that which "is equally present in the part and in the whole," viz., the axioms of physics, plus whatever else can be deduced from these axioms. These common properties are due to the presence in all finite individuals of the "fixed and eternal things," 32 i.e., the infinite modes. Reason does not yield knowledge of individual things. The third type of knowledge, scientia intuitive, gives us "adequate knowledge of the essence of things." 33 This knowledge is of individual objects. 34 It is intuitive knowledge of 23 Ibid., Book II, Axiom L. 24 Ibid., Book IV, Appendix, Section VI. 25 Ibid., Book II, Prop.

And thus the equation of God with Nature in Book IV of the Ethics and the equation of the eternal laws of nature with the decrees of God in the Theologico-political Tractate represent merely an identification of God's "lower" activities with Nature. Beyond Nature and spatio-temporal existence lies "existence itself," "existence in the attributes of God," or "existence in God," as it is vari- ously called - a type of existence to be known not by empirical knowledge, not even, ultimately, by reason, but only by scientia intuitive. We come now to Spinoza's concept of immortality. He introduces the topic at the end of the Scholium to Proposition XX of Book V: I have now concluded all that I had to say relating to this present life ... It is time, therefore, that I should now pass to the consideration of those matters which appertain to the duration (duratio) of the mind without relation to the body. Spinoza's language is not altogether precise here, but "this present life" means life in the common order of nature, and "without relation to the body" means without relation to the spatio-ternporal existence of the body. Spinoza shows that sense-perception, imagination, and memory depend upon the spatio-temporal existence of the body. 38 But the essence of the body is something quite different, and is eternally in God. 3 And to this, corresponds an idea of the essence of the body - which is, of course, the essence of the mind. Spinoza makes it quite clear that he is not speaking of the essence of body in general, but of "this or that" body. 39 This essence of the mind that remains after the dissolution of the body (or after the termination of the duration, or existentia actualis of the body) is the intel- lect. 40 The acts of the intellect are the second and third types of knowledge. And from the third type of knowledge springs the intellectual love of God, 41 which is eternal, 42 and which is part of the infinite intellectual 35 Ibid., Book V, Prop. XXIV; Book I, Prop. XV, Prop. XXV, Cor. 36 Proposition XXIV of Part V, "The more we understand individual objects, the more we understand God", does not mean, "the more empirical knowledge we get, the more we know God-meaning 'Nature,"' The proposition means "we understand by the third type of knowledge" (intelligemus). It does not imply that God is simply the sum of all that is "out there." 37 Ethics, Book V, Prop. XXI. 38 Ibid., Prop. XXII, XXIII. 39 Ibid., Prop. XXIII, Scholium. 40 Ibid., Prop.

This does not mean that we have a second life, just like the "present life" in space and time - only better. This Spinoza explicitly denies. 45 But neither does it mean that all that remains is one eternal "active intellect." Al- though there is little room for "personality" anywhere in Spinoza's system, whatever true individuality we do have survives death. In fact, only with the greatest difficulty can we discover our own individuality while alive in the common order of nature. Spinoza's closing words in the Ethics have a precise meaning. ... the ignorant man is not only agitated by external causes in many ways, and never enjoys true peace of spirit, but lives also ignorant, as it were both of God and of things, and as soon as he ceases to suffer, ceases also to be. On the other hand, the wise man, in so far as he is considered as such, is scarcely ever moved in his mind, but, being conscious of himself, of God, and of things, never ceases to be, and always enjoys true peace of soul. The ignorant man, who lives in the common order of nature is the product of external causes. His "personality" is the outcome of his con- ditioning. He is ignorant of his own true self, his eternal intellect. As soon as his "personality" ceases its spatio-temporal adventures (as soon as it ceases to suffer), it ceases to be. But the Sapiens, who lives according to the order of the intellect, is conscious of his true self (and of God and of things - by the third type of knowledge) and never ceases to be. Objections to the above interpretation are two-fold: First, the line adopted by Richard McKeon: It (Spinoza's doctrine of immortality) has all the marks of the averroistic doctrine with which he was doubtless familiar by way of Maimonides; it is an immortality of the part of us which can come into contact with the eternal essences which depend on God; Averroes would have called it the active intellect which is the same for all men; but certainly it is not a personal immortality ... Imagination, memory, and even abstract ideas will disappear with the dissipation of the body, and conse- quently all knowledge which referred to individuality and to the things which influence and support individuality will be lost. 46 McKeon's error lies in assuming that Spinoza must have believed that 43 Ibid., Prop. XXXVI. 44 Ibid., Book IV, Appendix, IV; Book V, Prop. XXXIII, Scholium; Prop. XXXVI, Scholium. 45 Ibid., Book V, Prop. XXIII, Scholium; Prop.

There is no evidence whatsoever that Spinoza did believe this, or that his system should have led him to believe it; on the contrary, all the evidence, together with the requirements of his basic postulates, led Spinoza to conceive of an infinite diversity of eternal modes of substance - like Leibniz's infinite panoply of monads. McKeon's line of argument could equally prove that according to Leibniz, there are no monads - since monads aren't in space and time, and therefore cannot differ from each other. The second line of objection consists of admitting that the individual essence is eternal, but then going on to say that this is without any signifi- cance, because in Spinoza's system everything is eternal. All things have souls. 47 All are eternal: the wise man, the foolish man, the mouse, and the angel. The littlest speck of dust is just as eternal as the wisest of sages. All Spinoza is really asserting is that there is an eternal order of essences mirroring in some way the order of actual existence. The answer is that there is a difference between the wise man and the fool. Spinoza makes this clear in the Scholium to Proposition XXXIX of Part V: ... he who, like an infant or child, possesses a body fit for very few things, and almost altogether dependent on external causes, has a mind which, considered in itself alone, is almost entirely unconscious of itself, of God, and of objects. On the other hand, he who possesses a body fit for many things possesses a mind which, considered in itself alone, is largely conscious of itself, of God, and of objects. In this life, therefore, it is our chief endeavor to change the body of infancy, so far as its nature permits, and is conclusive thereto, into another body which is fitted for many things, and which is related to a mind conscious of itself, of God, and of objects. The trick is to make some sense out of this and then to reconcile it with the following: . . . although we are now certain that the mind is eternal in so far as it conceives things under the form of eternity, yet, in order that what we wish to be proved may be more easily explained and better understood, we shall consider the mind, as we have hitherto done, as if it had just begun to be, and had just begun to understand things under the form of eternity. 48 And: ... the mind has eternally possessed these same perfections which we imagined as now accruing to it, and has possessed them with the accompanying idea of God as the eternal cause.49 47Ethics, Book II, Prop. XIII, Cor. 48 Ibid., Book V, Prop. XXXI, Scholium. 49 Ibid., Book V, Prop. XXXII, Scholium - this is proposition stating that the intellectual love of God is eternal.</page><page sequence="9">520 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Without any particular belief in my having succeeded in capturing what Spinoza himself intended, let me offer an analogy from Eastern philosophy. There the two orders of existence: appearance and reality, Maya and Brahman. Each individual person "has" a psycho-physical apparatus - soul and body, and an eternal self - Atman, Purusha. Salvation consists in becoming aware of this eternal self. "You" have the possibility of identifying yourself with your psycho-physical apparatus (jiva) or with the Atman. If "you" have identified yourself with the psycho- physical apparatus, then you are unconscious of the true self, and you die. But if you have rejected the psycho-physical apparatus as the "you" and have identified yourself with the Atman or Purusha, then "you" are e- ternal. 50 Thus for Spinoza, salvation is becoming aware of your true self, the Atman, Purusha, the intellect. It is recollection, the "roar of awaken- ing." To see how the Sage is more eternal than a stone, we must introduce two sets of distinctions only one of which is more or less explicit in Spinoza. First, there are two orders of causality: (1) the, as it were, vertical relation between God and each mode. Each mode is eternally in God and follows from the necessity of divine nature. This is the causality appertaining to the essences of things. This is also the realm of freedom, for each mode, when it acts, is free. One may say that a mode is, with respect to its essential conatus, casa sui per aliud (i.e., freely dependent upon God), while God is casa sui per se. (2) the, as it were, horizontal causality between modes in the common order of nature. This is the causality appertaining to modes in so far as they are determined to exist and to operate with respect to a certain time and place. 51 Secondly, we must distinguish in the common order of nature between true modes and pseudo-modes, or between monadic modes and aggregate modes. A true mode is the manifestation in space and time of one essence, of one entelechy, one conatus. It is a true Aristotelian substance. It is the expression of one Schopenhauerian Idea. The empirical sign of a true mode is the presence of telic activity. A pseudo-mode is a composite body, whose activity is the expression of the aggregate of the conatus of the true modes of which it is composed. The empirical sign of this is, of course, the absence of telic behavior. The events in space and time are entirely a matter of changing external relations among the true modes - the formation, alteration, and destruction 50 I don't feel called upon to show that any of the above makes sense. It may be nothing but linguistic salad, but it is a widespread sort of nonsense - the ordinary language of mysticism. 51 These two causal orders in some way correspond to Leibniz's realm of grace and realm of nature, also to Kant's noumenal and phenomenal orders, and also to Schopen- hauer's Idea and idea.</page><page sequence="10">"DEus, SIVE NATURA ..." 521 of aggregates. 52 To the extent that the "being" of a thing lies entirely in its external relations, to that extent it is perishable, of no eternal signifi- cance - a mere aggregate. Thus the idiot is little more than a congeries of Pavlovian reflexes - his chief significance is that he takes up space. Whereas the wise man is the expression of one essence, one conatus. He has significance beyond the external relations into which his essence enters. And to the extent that he identifies himself with this essence, he is independent of his external relations. And thus death, which signifies the end of most of the external relations is of little concern. 53 Thus we see that not everything is eternal. Only the true modes, the true individuals, the modes which are free in God, those which express one unitary conatus are eternal. In the case of man, the conatus is the essence of the body, and in thought, the intellect. Man as he empirically exists is this conatus plus all the modifications, the "accidents" expressing the relationships of man to other things in Nature. Sense-perception, imagin- ation, and memory are concerned with the accidents, with man's ad- ventures in the common order of nature. The intellect, at least insofar as it has the third kind of knowledge, is concerned with the essence. Death merely means that this conatus is no longer entangled in the space-time order. HARRY M.
