<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNIVERSAL RELIGION AND UNIVERSALIST RELIGION* I have entitled my address "Universal Religion and Universalist Religion" in order to express my provisional doubts regarding the possibility of a universal religion. What I am interested in, at the moment, is the strengthening of the universalist orientation and the realization of the universalist potential in the extant historical reli- gions. I shall try to elaborate on this. Once upon a time all religions were particularistic. Like languages or other social phenomena and institutions, they had their natural growth in natural and political communities - whether tribes, cities, or states - and they were essentially concerned with the needs of the group also in its dealings with the supernaturals - the ancestors, the gods, or god. Even the ancient Israelites, although they knew that "all the gods of the nations are but godlings, and the Lord has made the heavens" and although their descendants repeat thrice daily in their prayers "for they (scil. the nations) bow down to vanity and nothingness, and pray to a god that cannot help," would nonetheless express their fidelity to their God Yahweh in these terms: "For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for ever and ever" (Micah 4:5). Biblical and post-biblical Israel did not, as a rule, desire or attempt to impose its worship on others. Yet its breakthrough to universalism implied a certain degree of exclu- siveness, intolerance and, indeed, fundamental negation of other religious traditions. It was no longer merely a question of letting every people legitimately serve its gods, but of insisting at the same time that these gods were vanity and nothingness. Whilst most ancient and primitive religions were ethnocentric and hence tole- rant - for other religions have the same right to exist as other peo- * Editor's note.

This is, no doubt, a poor kind of tolerance, since it is not material but at best purely formal as regards outside groups. It allows for co-existence, but excludes communion with others. The religions that came in the wake of Judaism claimed univer- sality in an even more far-reaching sense, and hence their univer- salism, that is to say their intolerance, was both internal and external, material and formal, intensive and extensive. Universalist religions have taken considerable pride in their universalism, vaunting it as a major virtue and looking down with a certain contempt on e.g., Judaism and its narrow-minded and ethnocentric particularism. They rarely rendered account to themselves of the "centrism" of their own attitudes, and of their fundamental unwillingness to accept, let alone respect or appreciate, the specific individuality and inte- grity of other religious groups. It matters little for our present pur- pose whether this universalist intolerance is practical or merely theoretical, whether it expresses itself in aggressive or otherwise offensive missionary activity, in less militant "testimony," or in purely doctrinal positions. The fact remains that the classical Chris- tian missionary is not the right man to help you understand Islam or Hinduism. One shudders to imagine what the rhapsodically universalist prophet known as the Second Isaiah would have had to say to someone desirous of a deeper appreciation of say ancient Babylonian or Greek religion. But then the universalistically minded are having an easy time : they mostly define their problem in terms of the relationship between the great universal religions of today, and they rarely bother about the primitive and "dead" religions which they gladly leave to the anthropologists and to the historians respectively. The truth of the matter is that the nature and moral quality of both "universalism" and "particularism" are less unequivocal than is often assumed. Universalism is often expansionist precisely be- cause it is universalist also in its determination to suffer no other gods; it is, indeed, universalistically exclusive. Particularism, on the other hand, having no universalist pretentions, may appear to admit of co-existence and even to harbour possibilities of a plura- listic respect for the individuality and integrity of other religious</page><page sequence="3">UNIVERSAL RELIGION AND UNIVERSALIST RELIGION 3 configurations. Ethnocentrism and intolerance are not necessarily related. In fact, it could be argued that they are related in inverse ratio. I have discussed this subject elsewhere and do not wish to go once more over familiar ground. But before proceeding with my argu- ment, let me briefly recall the type of religion which, in the jargon of comparative religionists, is described as mystico-philosophical and of which certain forms of Hinduism are generally held to be typical examples. This type of religion is less exclusive than the prophetic religions, though it definitely considers itself as far supe- rior if only for the simple reason that it is aware of the relativity of all finite ways to the infinite goal, whereas the other and "lower" reli- gions think of themselves as absolutes. In other words, this type of religion holds its own (relative) relativism to be an absolute yard- stick. This may render it more tolerant - although its tolerance is of a somewhat supercilious kind - and possibly, though I am not sure of this at all, more commendable, but it certainly implies a judg- ment on other religions rather than a genuine understanding of their specificity. To preach this kind of universalism - the essential unity of the infinitely many ways to the infinite one - is itself a definite religious position or option, and not the discovery of an objective quality present in all religions. It is characteristic of the last-mentioned type of religion that it includes other religions, albeit in a relativizing and subordinating manner. It is hardly necessary to point out that the prophetic viz. biblical type of religion also has a general concept of religion, though it is used for purposes of exclusion. Of course we do not always and everywhere find the term "religion" (or its equivalent), but we hear of other gods, strange gods, or false gods, and of people who serve viz. "whore after" these false gods. But this very exclusiveness seems to assume the existence of a general category of religion. A biblical prophet would never dream of saying that Kemosh, Tammuz, Ba'al, etc., were other, alternative names for Yahweh. On the contrary, he would insist that on the expected day of final consummation not only Yahweh would be one but also his name one, i.e., no other names of god would be known. Perhaps the prophets were all too realist (in the medieval, philosophical sense) and not sufficiently nominalist in the matter of the names of gods, but surely their attitude is very different from, e.g., that of the Great Goddess who,</page><page sequence="4">4 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION in Apuleius' description of her revelation to Lucius, asserted that she was known by many names to many nations although, of course, her "real" name was Isis. Hindus, too, can be exclusive in almost monotheistic fashion, as, e.g., the devotee of Vishnu who confesses that "he who believes in Vishnu knows no service of other gods, neither vow, invocation, nor vision." But no matter whether the notion of religion is used for purposes of inclusion or exclusion, its very existence (albeit, at times, implicit existence only) in all traditional religions necessitates a comment in view of certain contemporary trends. For it is only in our age that "religion" has become a dirty word not with atheists, materialists (dialectical or otherwise) and similar unbelievers, but with a certain brand of theologians. Thus a certain type of Protestant neo-orthodoxy eagerly embraces whatever makes a good, old-fashioned believer shudder. Everything is grist to the theological mill : biblical criticism, Marxism, sociology and psychology, provided it helps to show up religion for what it is - the human, all-too-human opium of fallen man, constructing for himself, at times in the most devious ways and by the most sophisticated methods, elaborate systems for comforting himself, deceiving himself, or otherwise trying to evade la condition humaine. Religion is, in fact, the supreme attempt of man to evade the problem of his existence ; it is the triumph of human autonomy even when it disguises itself as dependence on the very gods which it has created, and hence it is, ultimately, the worst of sins. The only real way of salvation is therefore not "religion" - for religion is a dirty word ; it is something which the others, those poor misguided fellows have - but the action of God, the judgment of God and the grace of God. It is something utterly sui generis. It would be unfair to attribute this attitude exclusively to Protestant neo-orthodoxy. There are similar trends in Judaism and Islam where, of course, the central and saving category (i.e., that which saves man from his anthropocentric autonomy and all its works and projections) is not faith but obedience to a god-given law. What all these have in common is the horror of human autonomy as their basic anthropo- logical stance. Salvation comes from heteronomy. Now, of course, there is no reason at all why the unregenerate outsider, lacking the necessary grace, should not view these theolo- gical lucubrations as just one more example of - horribile dictu - religion, one more pathetic, devious and rather naive attempt to</page><page sequence="5">UNIVERSAL RELIGION AND UNIVERSALIST RELIGION 5 provide an answer to man's anguish. Even the rejection of "reli- gion," the radical criticism, the prophetic judgment on all human efforts, the both humble and arrogant flight to redeeming heter- onomy may well be interpreted as a thoroughly human reaction - by way of projection - to the human predicament since, as we all know, self-transcendence is one of the essential characteristics of human nature. Indeed, it is the human function par excellence. Much the same can be said about the other, allegedly more mod- ern and contemporary version of the idea that Christianity is not religion. This gospel of Christianity without religion with its theology after the death of God and its mythology of an existential Christ taking the place of a defunct, pre-modern mythological God, is so patently based on a narrow and arbitrary parish-pump definition of religion that the professional student cannot help wondering whether the hot-gospellers of the new kerygma are really serious or intellectually competent. Of course religious metaphysics, belief in a personal all-too-anthropomorphic god, ritualism, ecclesiastical institutionalism, pietist emotionalism, etc., have all been part of religious history, but so have opposite tendencies. I suspect that to an orthodox Theravada Buddhist, who would certainly agree with some of the things said by the honest-to-god theologians and yet call Buddhism a religion, the modernist definition of religion would seem shocking in its western dogmatic culturo-centrism. For our purposes the modern, faddist distinction between religion (which is bad) on the one hand, and, on the other hand, the one true religion which is, by definition, no religion at all, can be dis- missed as irrelevant and we may return to the notion of religion shared by all religions. I do not intend to make myself a fool in public by offering yet another definition of religion. Experience has taught us that definitions are either so wide as to embrace too much and hence become meaningless, or else are too narrow and selective, and consequently leave out much that should be included. Defini- tions of religion, when they are absolutely necessary, should be operational, geared to the specific problem under investigation. Fortunately, we find that we can generally dispense with definitions. Anthropological field-workers have, as a rule, had little difficulty in distinguishing between a secular and a ritual dance. In fact, most definitions of religion are not of a descriptive but of a prescriptive nature; their purpose is not to say what religious people do, or say,</page><page sequence="6">6 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION or think, but what the authors of the definitions wish to acknowl- edge as religion. I have already had occasion to refer to a certain kind of inclusive religion which, whilst not necessarily syncretistic, nevertheless accords all religions (or at least to many of them) a rightful place under the sun. I also mentioned certain forms of modern Hinduism as representative of this tendency. But Hinduism is not the only example. There are others, and they resemble the so-called "higher" Hinduism in that each somehow attempts to assert its superiority. This superiority, as I have pointed out, is based not on the denigra- tion of other religions but rather on the alleged fact that it alone is inclusive enough to allow every other religious system its relative place. I need not remind you that this procedure has been traditional both in certain forms of Christian theology and in certain forms of western philosophical thinking about religion, indebted as it was to Christianity. Ancient Christian theologians would say that even the pagan religions might be a providential praeparatio evangelica. Hegel, who surely did not intend to be a spokesman of either religion or the Christian faith, accorded to all religions a place in his construction of the development of the Spirit. But in this scheme or construction, Christianity functions not as one religion among others - not even as the highest - but as absolute religion i.e., the quintessence of the concept of religion as such. Other liberal theologians, however much they might differ from Hegel in other respects, adopted his perspective. The great Harnack argued that Christianity was no positive religion like Islam or Judaism, but that it was "religion as such." Troeltsch, whose Die Absolutheit des Christentums und die Reli- gions geschichte sufficiently testifies to his concerns, considered Chris- tianity to be not only the acme and climax of all religious develop- ment but the point of convergence of all religions and all religious experience. This, of course, is the point of view of a theologian, and theology is a normative science. Even van der Leeuw's Religion in Essence and Manifestation which, as its subtitle indicates, was supposed to be not a theology but a phenomenology of religion, always ends up, somewhat miraculously, with the structures of Christianity as the most highly developed, inclusive or otherwise most meaningful. His phenomenology is, in fact, a theology in disguise. I have mentioned Harnack, Troeltsch and van der Leeuw, and it is no accident that theologians interested in the history of religions</page><page sequence="7">UNIVERSAL RELIGION AND UNIVERSALIST RELIGION J have always returned to the problem of the meaning of "other" religions. Historians of religion who, like myself, are merely histo- rians of religion and whose interest in theology is derivative, i.e., due to the fact that theology is one of the many bricks of which the fabric of the history of actual religions is made up, have much the same problem though it presents itself in a somewhat different form. Certainly the hierarchism which puts one particular religion (or type of religions) at the top of the pyramid as the fulfillment, perfec- tion, or point of convergence of all other religions is repugnant to the comparative religionist, as indeed it seems to be also to many broader minded theologians. Harnack, and in his own way also Troeltsch, had wondered about the place of the study of the history of religions in the Faculties of Christian Theology. Traditionally the History of Religions had been either part of the branch of theology known as apologetics, or else it was conceived as the study of God's ways with man (or possibly of man's ways with God) outside the small and elect segment of humanity that was irradiated by the light of direct revelation. Archbishop Nathan Soederblom, that great Christian, great pioneer of ecumenism, and great historian of religion, once suggested that the history of the religions of the world should take the place vacated, in the Faculties of Divinity, by the defunct Natural Theo- logy. Soederblom here took his stand where all historians of religion still take it: on the decisive discovery of Schleiermacher that there was no such thing as Natural Religion; there only were positive religions. I shall return to this point in a moment. For our present purpose suffice it to note that Soederblom, as a Christian theologian, wanted to introduce the concept of a General Revelation as the basic category underlying the history of all religions. His purpose was not the discovery of a non-existent universal abstraction, but to examine whether, in the variety of concrete and individual configurations of precisely the irrational, the numinous and the mysterious, there appeared a common direction that would point or testify to another reality or to a common, deeper awareness. Soederblom knew that already Justin Martyr had invoked the notion of the logos spermatikos, God's seminal logos, which was equal- ly active in the pagan philosophers and in the Hebrew Scriptures. The notion of a General Revelation had the merit of viewing the "other" religions as positive, legitimate and authentic; in fact, they</page><page sequence="8">8 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION were, in one way or another, the result of a divine activity. Never- theless, to the student of religions this notion must appear extremely dubious, and for aught I know it may even be untenable from a theological point of view. The concept of a General Revelation is based on what seems to be a rather confused and muddled use of the term "Revelation." Of course the student of religions cannot pronounce on the "revealed" character of any religion. To begin with, he distinguishes, in Usener's terms, between Offenbarungsreligion and geoffenbarte Religion, i.e., between revelation-type of religion and revealed religion. On the latter he has nothing to say. The former is neither a theological nor a metaphysical, but a descriptive and typological term. Its purpose is to distinguish between religions which claim a revelation as their source, and systems which do not make this claim. If we examine religious claims about revelations we find that precisely as there is no natural religion but only specific, positive religions, so there is no such thing as a general revelation but only individual revelations or, to be more exact, individual experiences or traditions of revelation. Revelation as an abstraction without phenomenal content is meaningless. Revelation as the self- revelation of God or of transcendence to somebody is thus structural- ly different from other experiences of sudden insight or deepened awareness which are perhaps better described as illuminations, intuitions and the like. Since revelation is an empirical term de- scribing a definite experience or tradition, the assertion that "history" or "nature" are the media of a general revelation can only mean that they are potential loci of specific revelation-experiences, precisely because they have functioned as such in the past. And once we are determined to dignify certain phenomena with the prestige-word "revelation," why not apply it to anything we think to be good, or beautiful, or noble, or challenging? Why not apply it also to a Beethoven String Quartet, or to a Bach fugue, or - lest my musical tastes seem to be too square - to rock and roll, especially as only the other day I learned from a progressive sheet which I picked up on the campus of Columbia University that "rock music points an accusing finger at society for the state the world is in. It speaks of a new order. A world where people are real and values are just." I conclude that rock music has taken over the functions of Amos and Isaiah. Let us hope with better success. The thinkers of Reform Judaism suffered from a similar delusion.</page><page sequence="9">UNIVERSAL RELIGION AND UNIVERSALIST RELIGION 9 They, too, seem to have believed that muddled thinking could make good theology and hence they talked much about "progressive revelation." But why revelation? And who is it that reveals himself? Why not progressive evolution, or progressive discovery, or progres- sive awareness? And if it be said that one man's revelation is another man's discovery, then let us at least respect the specificity of the various experiences and not force them into the mold of our pet theological jargons. And there I come to my final, and perhaps only point. I praised Soederblom and Schleiermacher because they wished to theologize about actual, historical, positive religions and not about the artificial construction of a natural religion. It is true that all religions are "natural" (unless you happen to believe that your own religion is different and supernatural), but in that case the term "natural" is both meaningless and useless. At any rate the Natural Religion of which medieval theologians (who were theists) and enlightened philosophes (who were deists) spoke never existed. It was a figment of the rationalist imagination, an artificial construct based on the assumption that reason = nature. The positive historical religions were therefore not natural at all, since nobody can possibly pretend that they are particularly reasonable. The old debate between Natural Religion versus General Revela- tion is of immediate relevance to our theme, because when people speak of religious universalism they must ask themselves whether they refer to an artificial construct, something which never has been though they hope that one day it might be, or to some common de- nominator (which they themselves determine on the basis of other criteria) of certain positive religions. In the one case one would have to agree on a set of metaphysical doctrines, moral values or existential attitudes; in the other case one would have to select certain religions (usually the great monotheistic or universal reli- gions) and quietly forget about others, and assume moreover that the religions one has selected share certain basic values that would provide the common denominator that would lead them from their particularistic captivity to the promised land of universalism. But this, of course, means tampering a good deal with the actual con- tents and structures of the respective religions. And whilst every religion is entitled to change, and in fact does change continually under the pressures of the Zeitgeist - and our Zeitgeist seems to put a</page><page sequence="10">10 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION premium on a universalist orientation - it is quite a different matter to misinterpret the actual state of a religion or to prescribe to it what it should become. At the beginning of my talk I said that religions, like languages, had their natural growth in natural and political communities. Now, towards the end of my talk I want to explain that this comparison was made advisedly. I am not referring to the fact that modern linguistics, and structural phonology in particular, have inspired much of the modern approach to anthropological and religious studies. My point at present is more naive and simple. We all talk about language - its nature, functions, laws, etc., yet we know that nobody ever did or ever will speak "language" as such. There are languages, and whenever we speak, we speak a language. Of course languages arise, change and occasionally die out. Some "small" languages get crowded out by "universal" languages, and occasion- ally mixtures occur that produce "syncretistic" languages. Never- theless, I suppose that few of us are likely to wax enthusiastic about the prospects and the possible range and depth of artifical languages such as Esperanto or Volapuk. We leave it to linguists to analyze the nature of language, and to philosophers and technicians to evolve metalanguages and programme-languages respectively for their specialized purposes. But human experience, at least for the time being, articulates itself in "positive" languages. I want to suggest that thinking about universal religion should move along similar lines. A universal religion is either one religion imposing itself on the whole world, or an artificial invention (like Natural Religion), or an artificially distilled common denominator of all or some historical religions. If we reject these possibilities - and I do not think them to be real possibilities in any sense - then universa- lism can only mean the universalist orientation of each and every religion, that is to say its commitment to humanity as such, its openness to the world and to all men, its readiness to be involved in the hopes, agonies, struggles and aspirations of not only Everyman but Everygroup, in its profound respect for the ways in which others experience the mystery of existence and articulate their basic com- mitments. In brief, I suggest no universal religion but universalist religions. And I have said before that there is no standard recipe for evoking the universalist dimension potentially present (if at all) in the actual religions. Every religion has to struggle with itself and to</page><page sequence="11">UNIVERSAL RELIGION AND UNIVERSALIST RELIGION I I discover its own potential and the ways to actualize it. I do not wish to be misunderstood as smuggling in a prescriptive formula under the guise of a descriptive presentation. I do not mean to say that a universal religion could not, or should not, arise, but I simply record my impression that such a development is less likely, and less promising for the time being than the universalistic broadening and deepening of the extant historical religions. No doubt the comparison of religions with languages, like all comparisons, is somewhere wrong and misleading. It just will not do to say that we are dealing with alternative patterns of communica- tion in the one case, and with alternative patterns of symbolizing the meaning of life and its values on the other. The direction in which liberal pluralism is drifting is indeed that presupposed by my comparison, but in doing so it is making light of the intellectual integrity and the cognitive contents that frequently go with religion. Reducing the variety of religions to the variety of symbols may seem to be very open-minded and large-hearted and ecumenical, nay even scientific, but it may also be dodging the issue. Can we really be sure that the differences relate to the level of symbols only before we have adequately clarified to our minds the relation between symbol and that which is symbolized? By erecting a structure of religious understanding and inter-religious relations on a theory of symbols or of symbolic processes we are, in fact, already smuggling in a philosophical parti pris, to wit the doctrine that religion is concerned neither with facts nor with truth but with truthfulness in the sense of personal integrity and authenticity. But can human beings be truly authentic and make light of the demands of reason? Perhaps we should ask ourselves whether we do not substitute tact, understanding and sympathy for intellectual integrity whenever we fail to react negatively to certain religious phenomena, including certain religious doctrines. The question at least deserves to be asked. Earlier generations of Christian scholars had no hesitation to say what they thought about the Prophet Muhammad. To say the same things today would be considered to be in very bad taste. Yet nobody seems to have any qualms about qualifying Messrs. Reeve and Muggleton as psychopaths. The reason seems to be that the sect of the Muggletonians no longer exists and that hardly anybody knows that in the 1 7th and 1 8th centuries there were Christians who used to sing</page><page sequence="12">I 2 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION I do believe in God alone, Likewise in Reeve and Muggleton. Christ is the Muggletonian king To whom they evermore will sing. My point here simply is that what appears to be open-mindedness and regard for other denominations viz. religions is often nothing of the kind, but is really social tact and human respect for our religious contemporaries. Alternatively one is driven to the conclu- sion that our respect for religions depends on the accidents of history and on statistics (i.e., the number of believers and the length of time a certain religion exists) rather than on objective criteria. There are millions of Muslim contemporaries, so we resent denigrations of Islam. There are no more Muggletonians, so we can permit our- selves a superior smile. But if tact and personal respect are not enough and more definite value criteria are held to be necessary, then I am afraid that even our belief in the unity of mankind and in the unity of knowledge cannot justify our simply shifting our terms of reference from true versus false to genuine versus inauthentic respectively. Perhaps the cognitive contents of religion will one day be less important, but on that day the historian of religion will have to note that religions have entered on a new stage in their history. Until this stage is reached, it is good to remind ourselves that not only the prophetic religions make exclusive judgements of true and false. The great Zen master Dogen had this to say on the subject: It is said that the essence of the three religions is identical. [Let me explain that Dogen Zenji was neither an American nor a European. When he spoke of "the three religions" he therefore meant neither Catholics, Protestants and Jews, nor Jews, Christians and Muslims, but Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism] . . . that the difference is only that of the entrance into the Way [and not of the way itself], and also that they are comparable to the three legs of a tripod . . . This is the greatest folly. The phrase "the identity of the three religions" is worse than the babble of babes . . . If people say such things, Buddhism has already gone from them. These words of a great master should give us pause for thought,</page><page sequence="13">UNIVERSAL RELIGION AND UNIVERSALIST RELIGION 1 3 even if one of the thoughts could be to the effect that a time may come when Buddhism, and Christianity and Judaism and all the other religions will indeed "have gone from us." Martin Buber used to say that all religions were essentially different, but that in the end of days all would pass away in the fullness of the Kingdom of God. Buber could formulate this his version of an eschatological myth because, as an anti-Platonist, he did not believe in essences. For Buber, if I may say so, the essence was not really essential. And having quoted Dogen Zenji and Martin Buber, let me conclude by telling a story that brings the two together, and which I heard from one of the greatest living Zen masters. It is the story of a fruitful misunderstanding, and of an encounter in which one participant did all the talking, the second participant did all the listening, and the third participant did nothing at all. The Zen master was invited on a tour around the world by an ardent American admirer. When the two came to Jerusalem they called on Buber. The American talked, Buber listened, and the Zen master sat in silence. With great verve the American held forth that all religions were basically one, different variations on an identical theme, manifold manifestations of one and the same essence. Buber gave him one of his long, piercing looks, and then shot at him the question: "And what is the essence?" At this point the Zen master could not contain himself: he jumped from his seat and with both hands shook the hands of Buber. R. J.
