<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Reviews of Books A Country in the Mind: Wallace Stegner, Bernard DeVoto, Histor y, and the American Land. By John L. Thomas. (New York, Routledge, 2000. viii + 256 pp. $22 cloth, $19.95 paper) Scholars interested in twentieth-century public intellectuals, who, as friends, exchanged letters and publicized social issues, will welcome this book. It will also appeal to environmentalists, who can trace the evolving thought and action of two men who loved the Mountain West and developed a profound sense of unease about rampant capitalist exploitation of the region. Ultimately, both men believed that it was possible to reconcile individual aspirations for a good life and the social energies of a materialist society. John L. Thomas depicts Bernard DeVoto and Wallace Stegner, like many in- tellectuals before them, as advocates of an alternative, more com- munal way of life, one where human and natural resources were re- spected rather than exploited. Thomas presents brief biographical sketches of both men and refers to their literary work, but he is less concerned with their liter- ary legacy than with their western backgrounds, their professional travails, their histories, and their roles as activists. DeVoto was throughout his life something of a Progressive-Era conservationist; Stegner became a forerunner of the contemporary environmental- ist movement. Both men were nationalists, and both believed, in a sense, that geography was destiny and that the aridity of portions of the West offered the nation a lesson about the signiÞcance of living within natural limits. Neither man was attracted to Marxism. DeVoto made no secret of his bourgeois progressive sentiments, despite his attacks on cor- porate America. He died before race and gender replaced eco- nomic and national security as matters of historical concern. Steg- ner, who bridged the gap between the eras, retained much of his friendÕs deep suspicion of corporations when it came to the en- vironment, but he recognized the importance of race in Ameri- can life. Both men believed that the West, as a place, offered Amer- 669 </page> <page sequence="2"> 670 Paci c Historical Review ica a vision of a permanent commons to be shared by everyone. De- Voto, through his ÒUneasy ChairÓ column in Harper’s, and Stegner, through both his Þction and his environmental tracts, advocated a governmental rather than an individualistic approach to land use. Thomas analyzes the conßicted attitudes of both men toward irriga- tion projects. ThomasÕs command of the literature is excellent, and he weaves together in an engaging narrative both the lives and ideas of these remarkable men and their commitment to the sanctity of the public land. If Thomas is to be faulted, it is because he writes for knowledgeable insiders. This reviewer, who was reared reading De- Voto and sharing StegnerÕs views on the environment, doubts that many of the current generation of scholars will easily identify many individuals who receive only a passing reference in the text. There- fore, the more the reader knows of the events and issues that touched the lives of DeVoto and Stegner, the more this study will be appreciated. But no reader need be discouraged by these com- ments. Thomas has written a splendid and informed book that will repay a careful reading many times over. Huntington Library MARTIN RIDGE Native American Representations: First Encounters, Distorted Images, and Literar y Appropr iations. Edited by Gretchen M. Bataille. (Lincoln, University of Nebraska Press, 2001. x + 265 pp. $29.95 paper) That colonizing societies invariably produce self-servingly dis- tortive (mis)representations of the ÒOthersÓ they colonize has long been a theoretical commonplace. That such representations of real- ity serve to dehumanize the colonially subjugated, thereby rational- izing the system of colonial domination and licensing the coloniz- ersÑin their own minds, at leastÑto indulge in whatever range of exploitative practices they desire, without regard to the well-beingÑ or even survivalÑof the colonized, is by now equally well under- stood. Indeed, it has been pointed out that the imposition of co- lonial order quite literally requires demolition of autochthonous existence among the colonized. Thus do we encounter Jean-Paul SartreÕs 1968 equation of colonialism to genocide. While a great deal of work has been done since publication of Edward SaidÕs Orientalism (1978) with respect to the psycho-intel- lectual/literary ÒotheringÓ at work within classic imperial processes, these studies have been undertaken from an all but exclusively </page> <page sequence="3"> Reviews of Books 671 ÒpostcolonialistÓ perspective and have therefore focused upon the Third World contexts of Africa, Asia, and, to a signiÞcantly lesser ex- tent, Ibero-America. Comparatively little emphasis has been placed on North AmericaÑor places like Australia and New ZealandÑin this connection, and almost none upon the planetary array of in- digenous peoples comprising what has been aptly referred to as a ÒFourthÓ or ÒHostÓ World. The latter term seems especially appropriate insofar as all of the other three ÒworldsÓ have of necessity constructed themselves squarely atop the fourth. It follows that worlds one through three can be sustained only through the exercise of a perpetual and Òin- ternalÓ colonial dominion over the native peoples they have sub- sumed. This is the bedrock sociopolitical/economic arrangement deÞning not only settler states like the United States and Canada, but also such ostensibly decolonized Third World countries as India, Nigeria, and Brazil, each of whose borders were originally Þxed by EuropeÕs imperial powers and whose ongoing territorial integrity is entirely contingent upon usurpation/dispossession of the indige- nous nations situated therein. The same can be said of explicitly Òanti-imperialistÓ Second World conÞgurations like the PeopleÕs  Republic of China. In substance, while decolonization has yet to be seriously at- tempted in any First World settler state, it remains for the most part dramatically incomplete throughout the Second and Third worlds, where colonialism did not so much ÒendÓ as it changed form because of the multitudinous Ònational liberation strugglesÓ carried out from 1945 to 1985. Viewed from this perspective, notions of Òpost- colonialityÓ are truly insidious. In consigning colonialism itself to the past tenseÑthat is, in denying its contemporary existence and consequent relevanceÑÒpostcolonial discourseÓ is not simply mis- guided or inappropriate (much less ÒliberatoryÓ). Rather, its func- tion is hegemonic, reinforcing the conceptual apparatus by which colonialism in its present form is naturalized and thus legitimated. The implications of all this in terms of representation are pro- found. Fortunately, a relative handful of activist/scholarsÑmost but by no means all of whom are themselves ÒFourth WorldersÓÑ have lately begun to confront the matter head on. One of the better and more recent contributions to this emergent genre is Native American Representations, a slim and well-edited volume, put together by Gretchen Bataille and collecting ten papers prepared for a 1997 symposium conducted in France. Although all the material as- sembled therein is solid and well worth reading, the bookÕs cardinal virtue is its inclusion of the late Louis OwensÕs ÒAs If an Indian Were </page> <page sequence="4"> 672 Paci c Historical Review Really an Indian: Native Voices and Postcolonial TheoryÓ (pp. 11Ð 24), a brief but extraordinarily impactful essay that seems likely to place its authorÕs eventual inßuence alongside that of Frantz Fanon and Albert Memmi. A word of advice should be extended by way of conclusion. The Þeld in whichNative American Representations Þnds its place is new, the attendant background scholarship requisite to appreciating certain of its nuances correspondingly little known. Those ungrounded in its subject matter would thus do well not to expect it to stand on its own. ÒBeginnersÓ might best approach the book in conjunction with several others, notably Jimmie DurhamÕs A Certain Lack of Coherence (Kala, 1993), Arif DirlickÕsThe Postcolonial Aura (Westview, 1997), my own Fantasies of the Master Race (City Lights, 1998), and Linda Tuhi- wai SmithÕs Decolonizing Methodologies (Zed, 2001). That said, Native American Representations is wholeheartedly recommended. University of Colorado, Boulder WARD CHURCHILL Sifters: Native American Women’s Lives. Edited by Theda Perdue. (New York, Oxford University Press, 2001. xii + 260 pp. $49.95 cloth, $19.95 paper) Scholars and writers with backgrounds in history, anthropol- ogy, and literature contributed to this collection of essays on four- teen American Indian women: Pocahontas, Mary Musgrove, Molly Brant, Sacagawea, Catharine Brown, Lozen, Mourning Dove, Ger- trude Simmons Bonnin, Lucy Nicolar, Maria Montoya Martinez, Al- ice Lee Jemison, DelÞna Cuero, Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash, and Ada Deer. Spanning the seventeenth through the twentieth centuries and covering a wide range of tribal heritages and varied life experi- ences, this book provides an informative, in-depth portrayal of each woman and also would serve well as an introduction to the study of Native womenÕs history. Most of the essays take the form of biogra- phies, while the few that veer from the narrative of birth to death seem to be those dependent on scarce bits of information or a single text. For instance, Donna BarbieÕs ÒSacagawea: The Making of a MythÓ shows that we know little about SacagaweaÕs real life, and yet the national symbol of Sacagawea has a long, complicated history. The lives of these fourteen women were so different that few generalizations seem possible beyond remarking on how Native women have been important historical Þgures in vastly diverse ways, appearing in this book as traders, diplomats, warriors, writers, artists, musicians, educators, and political activists. The essays do not </page> <page sequence="5"> Reviews of Books 673 cast these women as worth remembering for a single act or achieve- ment but instead demonstrate the signiÞcance found in everyday lifeÑin making a living, in rising to the challenge and adapting to changing circumstances, in building strong relationships to family and community. Sifters will most likely become a widely adopted text for survey courses in womenÕs history and American Indian history because it addresses complex issues but at the same time makes for accessible and interesting reading. Moreover, students whose only knowledge of Indian history comes from movies and other media will be surprised at the stories of the twentieth century, when many of the Native women written about here reached the inner circles of political inßuence as writers, lobbyists, and bureaucrats. My only wish is that the book had fuller documentation. Each essay has some footnotes, which provide references for quoted ma- terial and list the relevant secondary works, but many of the details lack citations. While skimping on the documentation may be in- tended to please a popular audience, it will make it more difÞcult for scholars and student researchers to track down speciÞc material in the essays or to judge the quality and context of the information. University of Connecticut NANCY SHOEMAKER The Medicine Line: Life and Death on a North American Borderland. By Beth LaDow. (New York, Routledge, 2001. xviii + 272 pp. $25 cloth, $16.95 paper) This eloquently written and imaginatively conceived book il- lustrates the promise of a borderland approach to history. This is a history of a speciÞc section of the great semi-arid interior plain found on either side of the United States-Canada border between the Rocky Mountains and the Lake of the Woods; more speciÞcally, it focuses on southwestern Saskatchewan and north central Mon- tana. Its chronology bridges two cultural life forms, the indigenous hunting societies and early European frontier farm societies; it also links two deaths, the end of the Þrst and the decline of the second of these societies. This is a holistic study, revealing how state inter- ests, aboriginal life worlds, European dreams, scientiÞc and techno- logical innovation, and the natural environment worked dialecti- cally to transform a society in a very short span of time. Most importantly, it is a history of an international border. The aborigi- nal people called it the ÒMedicine Line,Ó a line that could determine the well-being of its Þrst inhabitants and shape the communities that followed the aboriginal demise. Ironically, the line that could </page> <page sequence="6"> 674 Paci c Historical Review protect speciÞc Indian groups from the conquering forces on either side of the line also symbolized the end of a sustaining relationship to the environment. In the end, the line brought little healing to anyone. The borderland approach to this study illuminates the nature of this transformation. This is made possible because Beth LaDow shows that a borderland geography actually existed. This is not a broad geopolitical history or a study in imagined transnationalism. In this account, real human beingsÑIndians, railroad men, farm- ersÑcross an international border with regularity, and when they donÕt, they nevertheless share a common environment that solicits a particular set of economic and political responses. In reconstructing the history of this transnational community, LaDowÕs study delivers much. Arguably it reveals much more fully the social and cultural dynamics of this region than have previous local studies, situated nation-centrically in either Canada or the United States. The book captures the broad history of aboriginal land extinction and the defeat of aboriginal nations as traditional hunting paths were intersected by two interlopers, the Northwest Mounted Police and federal American troops. It studies the gene- sis, creation, and implementation of a border and, more impor- tantly, the social effect of an arbitrarily drawn line in complete deÞance of physical features. In the process, it reveals how borders manipulated whole societies, but also how human agency exploited the border to individual advantage. The book recreates the physi- cal science of this regionÑthat is, an environmental history with all its elements: the recurring aridity and measureless space, the scientiÞc instruments to map and then exploit it, the shifting basis of the hope that humans placed in the land. It portrays the socie- ties that sought to take root in this kind of physical environment and recreates the dynamic social interactionsÑbetween racial groups, ethnic communities, gendered households, class interests, nationalistic forcesÑand the cultural repertoireÑsports activities, religious exercise, local societies, healing ritualsÑthat sought to bring meaning and palatability to life in an ecology put off balance by human greed. If the recreated borderland adds perspective to life in the inte- rior, it also allows the author to test the myths of the grand national narratives. Aboriginal societies appear less victimized, as they use the border to their advantage and as they turn on each other in the competition over scarce resources. The Lewis and Clark expedition is less exceptional than American accounts suggest. The Canadian Northwest Mounted Police appear less benevolent and ordered </page> <page sequence="7"> Reviews of Books 675 than Canadian accounts suggest. The frontier society is more simi- larÑinterethnic, hegemonically localistic, blindly optimistic, his- torically amnesiacÑthan local studies have suggested and the en- vironment of the interior far more indomitable. But other grand theories are underscored. LaDow endorses the great distinguishing myths of the orderly Canadians and the cavalier Americans. Al- though she does not engage the Canadian-driven Laurentian thesis, she notes how Metropolitanism and Burkean Toryism guided Cana- dian development. Similarly, she embraces Frontierism as an ideol- ogy, even if through it Òborders ßed to the margins of the national narrativeÓ (p. 20). Overall, the innovative borderland approach, the bookÕs rich narrative, its intelligent interpretations, and the deft hand of the au- thor make this not only a Þrst-rate history, but a worthwhile reading. University of Winnipeg ROYDEN LOEWEN Indian Treaty- Making Policy in the United States and Canada, 1867– 1877. By Jill St. Germain. (Lincoln, University of Nebraska Press, 2001. xxii + 243 pp. $45) Why did the settlement of the North American West take place so much more peacefully in Canada than in the United States? This is the fundamental question that Jill St. Germain addresses in her study. At the outset, she expresses doubt that the answer can be found in a more enlightened Canadian Indian policy. She also re- jects the notion that the contrasting history was the inevitable result of differing immigration histories and dissimilar geographic and economic circumstances. St. Germain allows that these Òcondition- ing factorsÓ were important but believes that more attention needs to be directed toward the roles that government ofÞcials played in shaping and implementing Indians policies. Accordingly, she fo- cuses on the crucial years from 1867 to 1877, when the United States and Canada negotiated treaties encompassing vast areas of the Great Plains. In the opening chapters, St. Germain sets the stage for her comparative study of these treaties by describing the divergence of U.S. and Canadian treaty policies from their common British roots after the War of 1812, when Indian nations ceased to be major play- ers in European American imperial struggles. In the United States, the removal of tribal groups from frontier settlement areas was the primary goal of Indian policy until mid-century. Shortly thereafter, </page> <page sequence="8"> 676 Paci c Historical Review the desire to establish peace on the increasingly turbulent western frontier became the driving concern. By the mid-1860s the harsh treatment of Indian tribes by the military led eastern humanitarians to press for an alternative approach to Indian-white relations that emphasized assimilation. In British North America, on the other hand, expediency, particularly the goal of obtaining aboriginal land cheaply, remained the overriding concern of policymakers through the 1870s. The humanitarian concerns of missionaries, who, like their American counterparts, sought to ÒcivilizeÓ and convert native people, had comparatively little inßuence. In spite of these divergent policy traditions, St. Germain notes that American and Canadian treaties of the 1860s and 1870s have many common elements, most notably annuity payment provisions, reserve allocations, and promises to help native people adopt agri- culture. Her comparative analysis of the treaties helps explain this; it also makes it clear that similar treaty provisions had very different implications in the two countries because of the countervailing forces that were responsible for them. For instance, the U.S. gov- ernmentÕs commitment to promote Indian farmingÑand the vast reserves it providedÑwas the result of political pressure to establish a ÒcivilizationÓ program. In Canada, on the other hand, it was the First Nations who demanded agricultural assistance. Reluctantly, Canadian negotiators agreed to this request in order to realize their aim of gaining title to aboriginal land. Because there was no co- herent Òcivilization policy,Ó the Canadian reserve allotment scheme did not provide an adequate land base for First Nations farming communities. St. GermainÕs study demonstrates that the comparative ap- proach to Indian/First Nations history yields valuable insights. Yet, it is also clear that the approach, as applied by the author, is seri- ously ßawed. To make her study manageable, she has elected not to give signiÞcant consideration to aboriginal perspectives. This is a re- markable choice, given that the treaties were cross-cultural accords. This leads St. Germain to be insensitive to historical issues that are of major concern to Indians and First Nations today. Her discussion of the roles interpreters played in treaty negotiations is an example. She warns that Òto emphasize the shortcomings of the interpreters would be a disservice to their very real contributions and obscure the nature of the misunderstanding that has plagued historical in- terpretation of the treatiesÓ (p. 60). The fact is that U.S. and Cana- dian treaty rights disputes and litigation often center around dis- agreements about what the treaties meant to the parties involved. Understanding the role interpreters played is, therefore, essential. </page> <page sequence="9"> Reviews of Books 677 St. Germain fails to tell the reader that the documentary record rarely tells us what interpreters actually said when they ÒexplainedÓ a treaty to a native group. Also, too often we do not know what stake an interpreter may have had in persuading aboriginal people to sign an agreement. University of British Columbia ARTHUR J. RAY Saving the Reservation: Joe Garry and the Battle to Be Indian. By John  Fahey. (Seattle, University of Washington Press, 2001. xi + 220 pp. $26.95) Saving the Reservation focuses on the life and work of Joe Garry, a member of the Coeur dÕAlene tribe, veteran of World War II and Korea, tribal chairman, president of the National Congress of Amer- ican Indians (NCAI), and Idaho state legislator. Despite the authorÕs claim that the book is meant to be the story of a remarkable man, rather than a history of the NCAI or an account of government- Indian relations, in the end it reveals as much about the latter two subjects as the former. John Fahey begins GarryÕs story in 1953, at the moment when the newly elected NCAI president set off to unite tribal leaders in opposition to legislation calling for the termination of federal relations with Indian tribes. Subsequent chapters jump abruptly backward and forward in time, covering the founding of the NCAI and its courtship of returning veterans like Garry during the 1940s; the development of the NCAI as an important national organization through the 1950s, with Garry at the helm; GarryÕs childhood, adolescence, and young adulthood from the 1910s to the 1930s; and GarryÕs work with his tribe from the 1940s to the 1960s, a pivotal period in which the Coeur dÕAlene negotiated a large settlement with the Indian Claims Commission and faced de- cisions on how to implement it. Specialists in American Indian history will appreciate this book for its details. Fahey uses correspondence and oral interviews to open windows onto the early years of the NCAI, such as former ex- ecutive secretary Helen PetersonÕs recollections of the organizationÕs Washington, D.C., ofÞce, with its second-hand furniture and volun- teer staff of two retired Bureau of Indian Affairs employees, Òone of whom liked to watch birds from the ofÞce windowÓ (p. 32). Simi- larly, FaheyÕs chapter on GarryÕs youth in northern Idaho should pique scholarly interest, since biographies of native experience dur- ing the early twentieth century are so few, especially for tribes of the </page> <page sequence="10"> 678 Paci c Historical Review interior PaciÞc Northwest. The many pictures of Garry through the years in his various roles are additional treats. Ultimately, however, for many scholars this will prove a frus- trating book. Long passages go without citations, stymieing those who would follow Fahey along the paths he has cleared. Chapters are loosely organized and lack the introductory statements and summaries of main points that help readers get their bearings. Short quotations from Garry and other NCAI members punctuate the text but often without corresponding analysis, making it unclear what they are meant to illustrate. Perhaps most disappointing is that the book contains a handful of intriguing arguments but never develops them systematically. In the preface, for example, Fahey claims that, over the course of his career, Garry Òset in motion forces that un- derlie Indian relations with the U.S. government todayÓ (p. x), yet the book ends abruptly in 1972, without discussion of the last three decades of U.S. Indian policy and GarryÕs inßuence. These kinds of omissions render the book a tantalizing but incomplete treatment of the life and legacy of a clearly remarkable individual. University of California, Los Angeles NICOLAS G. ROSENTHAL Historia: The Literar y Making of Chicana and Chicano Histor y. By Louis Gerard Mendoza. (College Station, Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2001. xi + 336 pp. $49.95 cloth, $24.95 paper) Louis Mendoza reminds us that the boundary between history and literature is porous; border crossings occur more frequently than we may like to imagine. Rather than policing this disciplinary boundary, he seeks to bring both sides into dialogue with one an- other. The different languages of ÒhistoryÓ and literature make this a difÞcult dialogue, but one nonetheless worth pursuing. The book is organized chronologically, beginning with an analysis of Jovita Gonz‡lez and Margaret EimerÕs novel Caballero, set in the Mexican-American War period, and ending with a discussion of contemporary texts by performance artist Guillermo G—mez Pe–a and journalist Ruben Mart’nez. Throughout the book, Mendoza in- vokes contemporary Austin poet Teresa Acosta to illustrate how Òimaginative narrativesÓ reveal more than historical ones. His juxta- position of twentieth-century Chicana/o literature and historical narratives is designed to undermine the Òmaster narrativesÓ of Chi- cano history. He argues that legitimizing literature as Òvalid histori- cal evidence enables a new way of conceptualizing the nature of power and its negotiation with more complexity and accuracyÓ </page> <page sequence="11"> Reviews of Books 679 (p. 19). For example, he contends that the generational approach to history glosses over the experience of many sectors of themexicano community by highlighting the actions of male leaders from a re- latively privileged middle class. He also Þnds the ÒofÞcial Chicano historiesÓ guilty of succumbing to Òtop-down, male-dominantÓ par- adigms that Òefface the everyday lives and cultural relations of dis- empowered women, children and menÓ (pp. 21Ð22). One of the threads through the book, and perhaps the most convincing, is MendozaÕs challenge to the notion of the ÒMigrant GenerationÓ as prepolitical and passive. By pointing to the liter- ary and political work of Sara Estela Ram’rez, a radical journalist and poet who collaborated with Ricardo Flores Mag—nÕs anarchist- leaning Mexican Liberal Party (PLM), Mendoza shows that the early twentieth century was not a time of passivity for all Mexicans in the United States. Emilio ZamoraÕs history of South Texas, which Men- doza cites, corroborates the notion of a politically active Mexican American community throughout the twentieth century. The ques- tion, then, is whether literature opens up Òa new wayÓ of conceptu- alizing history or whether it is just another source that historians have neglected. Along with his analysis of Ram’rez, Òuna Rosa Roja,Ó Mendoza uses Alejandro MoralesÕs 1988 novel Brick People, which is set in early twentieth-century California to offer a more social and cultural per- spective onmexicano survival strategies during this era. The Þctional approach, Mendoza asserts, allows Morales to Òoffer a critical view of history . . . by resisting a romanticization of race and class struggle and resistanceÓ (p. 81). As an historian, I am left wondering how  to weigh MoralesÕs 1980s Þctional view of California history over other historical narratives. The Þctional account may offer a dif- ferent view from the extant histories and may prompt historians to look for sources and counternarratives that they had overlooked. By itself, however, historical Þction does not undermine the Òmaster narrativesÓ of Chicano historyÑnew and innovative historical re- search does. Mendoza shows us how literary works are informed by history and how historical works are themselves imaginative narratives, but he does not intend to Òtotally blur genresÓ (p. 241). For him, the crucial difference between the two is that Òliterature is not con- strained by the past, the present, or . . . the futureÓ (p. 241). For me, the crucial distinction is that historians, although clearly inßuenced by the present political and social context, need to provide evi- dence. This evidence will, of course, be biased, but by revealing the sources and the interpretation of those sources, readers can judge for themselves. Literature makes its case without footnotes. </page> <page sequence="12"> 680 Paci c Historical Review The breadth of the literary and historical works that Mendoza covers in this book and his skillful use of theory make it a valuable source for scholars and students who are interested in Chicana/o history and the historiography of Chicana/o studies. Whether or not historians agree with MendozaÕs views of history, he provides an important challenge to historians to view their own work critically as literature, as well as to look at literature as more historical than we may think. Mendoza reminds us that, in the end, history is just a story with a lot of footnotes. Lewis and Clark College ELLIOTT YOUNG Thinking Orientals: Migration, Contact, and Exoticism in Modern Amer- ica.Henry Yu. (New York,OxfordUniversity Press, 2001. xiv + 262pp. $45 cloth, $19.95 paper) Today the word ÒorientalÓ is rarely used to refer to a person. In Thinking Orientals: Migration, Contact, and Exoticism in Modern Amer- ica, Henry Yu provides an intellectual history recounting the way that Asians in the United States came to be seen as Orientals. By tracing the origins of the theory of assimilation, Yu demonstrates how it served not only as a heuristic model for understanding in- terethnic relations for much of the twentieth century but also as  a central theoretical underpinning for the way that Asians came to be seen. In the 1920s Asians in America lived in the shadow of the Yel- low Peril. By 1924 a person of Asian descent, if not born in the United States, could not become a citizen or own property. Japanese and Chinese Americans were largely ghettoized in their own ethnic communities. In this harsh, anti-Asian climate, liberal academics joined hands with Protestant missionaries armed with the progres- sive tenets of the Social Gospel movement to improve race relations in America. Missionaries like J. Merle Davis set out for the West Coast funded by the Institute of Social and Religious Research, a New York-based organization backed by Rockefeller Foundation money. Likewise, the preeminent sociologist, Robert Ezra Park from the University of Chicago, dispatched several midwestern sociolo- gists to places like Vancouver, British Columbia, and BakersÞeld or Fresno, California, to study Asians. Bound by their common interest in Asians as well as their shared vision of better race relations, reli- gious clerics and secular academics combined forces and helped to found in 1924 the Survey of Race Relations on the West Coast. By examining the intellectual and cultural assumptions of re- </page> <page sequence="13"> Reviews of Books 681 searchers, Yu shows that, however progressive their thinking, their production of knowledge about the Oriental gave rise to the insti- tutional structure of orientalism. That is, while they argued that race had more to do with culture than with biology, they theorized from the point of view that the East represented everything backward, Òsluggish,Ó and Òprimitive,Ó whereas the West symbolized everything modern, dynamic, and progressive (p. 49). As a consequence, to be American came to be linked with modernity itself. According to ParkÕs theory of assimilation, one could quantiÞably measure the degree to which ethnic minorities have assimilated by observing fac- tors such as clothing, language, food, social activities, and educa- tion. It was assumed that by narrowing the social and physical dis- tance between ethnic groups all Americans would come to share a common memory and culture. None bore better testimony to the melting pot theory than the native informants who gathered insidersÕ information about being Chinese or Japanese and then theorized about the trajectory of their ethnic communities. Chinese and Japanese American sociologists like Frank Miyamoto, Tamotsu Shibutani, and Rose Hum Lee took racial advantage and occupied positions in the academy at a time when Asians in America had limited career options. In the process, Yu argues, they helped to spread and shape the ways in which the in- tellectual elite in America has come to think of the Oriental. Rather than make a judgment call about their role, Yu treats these inter- preters of culture, or native informants if you will, in all of their com- plexity as both agents as well as a products of their circumstances. Yu brings his study to closure by analyzing the movement from the Oriental to the model minority. As stylish as it is rigorous, this book is a major contribution to the way in which we have come to think of race in America. University of California, Berkeley GLORIA CHUN Remaking Chinese America: Immigration, Family, and Community, 1940 –1965. By Xiaojian Zhao. (New Brunswick, N.J., Rutgers Uni- versity Press, 2002. xvii + 265 pp. $22 paper) Xiaojian ZhaoÕs Remaking Chinese America makes two signiÞcant contributions to the historical scholarship on Asian Americans. First, the work examines an understudied chronological period by focusing on the years 1940 to 1965. Many studies on Chinese Amer- icans tend to begin in the mid-nineteenth century, when large num- bers of predominantly male laborers immigrated to the United </page> <page sequence="14"> 682 Paci c Historical Review States, and end with World War II, an era that witnessed the repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 and the rollback of other dis- criminatory practices due to the alliance between the United States and China. Even scholarship that examines more contemporary Asian American communities tends to overlook the middle decades of the twentieth century, focusing instead on the growth in popula- tion following the passage of the Immigration Act of 1965. ZhaoÕs work provides a thoughtful and well-researched analysis of the in- between period by examining how World War II and the Þrst two de- cades of the Cold War transformed the social, political, and cultural lives of Chinese Americans. ZhaoÕs second contribution to the Þeld of Asian American his- tory is to articulate the conceptual importance of family for under- standing the motivations, everyday lives, and political/legal activism of Chinese Americans. Instead of analyzing family as an after- thought to discussions of racism, immigration exclusion, and labor oppression, Remaking Chinese America emphasizes how the desire for family formation and reuniÞcation rested at the center of commu- nity concerns. During the period of exclusion, from 1882 to 1943, Chinese Americans circumvented restrictions by establishing Þctive and nonÞctive kinship networks to facilitate immigration. They also challenged exclusion directly by lobbying for more equitable legis- lation, mobilizing public pressure, and utilizing the court system to gain admission for both immediate and extended family members. Zhao makes a particularly compelling argument to explain the pre- dominance of male immigration during the exclusion era as a cal- culated strategy that responded to the gendered economic oppor- tunities and gendered legal immigration rights in the United States. With the repeal of exclusion and the passage of the War Brides and VeteransÕ Fianc es Acts during and after World War II, increas- ing numbers of women entered the United States, allowing Chinese American communities to approach gender parity and to transition from ÒbachelorÓ to family-centered societies. The increasing preva- lence of conjugal families during the postwar era correlated with a geographical dispersal of Chinese Americans away from ethnic en- claves. Along with the suburbanization movement, the political po- larization and harassment that stemmed from the Cold War envi- ronment lessened Chinese American reliance on traditional organizations and interest in China-focused politics. In this context, the ethnic press assumed greater responsibility for deÞning a sense of commonality among Chinese Americans and even offered a fo- rum for men and women to express anxieties about reforming fam- ilies after decades of separation. In constructing this narrative of Chinese America from 1940 to </page> <page sequence="15"> Reviews of Books 683 1965, Zhao conducted extensive research and utilized a variety of sources, including immigration Þles, ethnic newspapers, and oral histories. Her access to Chinese-language materials greatly enriched the project, allowing her to gain insight into the public as well as the personal lives of Chinese Americans. As one of the Þrst works to  examine this period seriously, this book does not explore some top- ics thoroughly. For example, how did the postwar focus on family formation within the Chinese American community relate to the broader societyÕs push toward domesticity following World War II? How did the American-born or American-raised women who sought opportunities beyond marriage and motherhood during the war relate to the wives who immigrated during the postwar era? How did the emerging focus on U.S. issues provide the foundation for Chinese American involvement in civil rights and other social move- ments of the 1960s and 1970s? In addition, critiques could be raised regarding ZhaoÕs conception of family, which encompasses both ex- tended and nuclear forms of kinship but relies upon heterosexual assumptions. Despite these questions,Remaking Chinese America rep- resents a solid work of historical scholarship. Those interested in immigration, family, race relations, transnational politics, and the domestic front during World War II and the Cold War will Þnd this book both engaging and intellectually stimulating. Ohio State University JUDY TZU-CHUN WU Women and the Conquest of California, 1542–1840: Codes of Silence. By Virginia M. Bouvier. (Tucson, University of Arizona Press, 2001. xvii + 266 pp. $40) Virginia M. BouvierÕs history of women in Spanish California Þts well with a growing critique of the Franciscan missionsÕ role in the colonization of California. She is concerned primarily with the experiences of Native American women as objects and actors in CaliforniaÕs conquest. Her investigation was made more difÞcult by Òcodes of silence,Ó by which she means the comparative lack of pri- mary documentation by and about women, and by historiansÕ con- scious and unconscious deletions of womenÕs experience from his- tory. Since most Indian women were illiterate in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, they did not record their own stories. Fortunately, oral testimony captured some of their memories for posterity, and the contemporary observations of men add details and context. The stories that Bouvier reveals are unhappy but not surpris- </page> <page sequence="16"> 684 Paci c Historical Review ing. She has expanded on the pioneering work of Sherburne F. Cook in the 1930s and historiansÕs elaborations during the past de- cade or so. This is not to say that BouvierÕs work is merely derivative. It is the most complete to date on Indian women in the mission era. She bases her work on records in the Archivo General de la Naci—n in Mexico City, as well as the Bancroft Library in Berkeley. She Þnds that women were abused by soldiers, priests, and the colonial system in general. Beyond that, she argues that the abusive control of women was a functional part of the colonial system that Spain im- posed through the Franciscan missions. But women were not merely voiceless victims on the edges of the Spanish frontier. They resisted by every means available to them, including self-imposed silences that were meant to keep colonizers ignorant of the true sentiments of the colonized women. Native women continued to practice in secret traditional healing arts (witchcraft to the missionaries). Sadly, Bouvier argues, these silences may have contributed to the high death rates and low birth rates that decimated the mission Indian populations. Priests prohibited tradi- tional Indian ceremonials, such as coming of age rituals that intro- duced young women to special female knowledge about sexuality and childbirth. According to Bouvier, women who lacked this infor- mation may have miscarried because of their ignorance. Occasional ethnographic errors mar BouvierÕs effort, as when she calls Cosumnes Miwoks Òcaptive Ohlone womenÓ (p. 98). Like- wise, she identiÞes the Chiruptos (a Patwin community) as Òpart of the Wintun nation of Ohlone tribesÓ (p. 121). The Wintun, Patwin, Miwok, and Ohlone are distinct tribal entities that should not be conßated. Despite these confusions, BouvierÕs account of women in the missions adds a great deal to our understanding of the gendered mission experience. It adds new fuel to the debate over the nature of the missions and the methods of the missionaries. And, despite the codes of silence that Bouvier describes, she has given new voices to Indian women who were hitherto mute. University of Oklahoma ALBERT L. HURTADO Storied Land: Community and Memory in Monterey. By John Walton. (Berkeley, University of California Press, 2001. xix + 342 pp. $40) John WaltonÕs sweeping account of Northern California ought to jump to the top of many Western historiansÕ reading lists. Walton takes social theory seriously, and he offers a powerful story with a </page> <page sequence="17"> Reviews of Books 685 strong and intriguing narrative. Storied Land reframes discussions of Monterey from the late eighteenth century forward by showing how discussions of the past inßuenced the unfolding present. Walton an- alyzes local booster narratives celebrating Monterey as a tourist des- tination, industrial haven, and picturesque setting for SteinbeckÕs Tortilla Flat, but as he explores the myths, the author puts forward an original account that provides Òa better, if always imperfect, his- toryÓ of Northern California (p. 302). WaltonÕs chapters move in chronological but never predictable fashion. ÒCalifornia,Ó in WaltonÕs words, Òbegan on Monterey BayÓ (p. 1), and he attends well to the regionÕs racial conßicts during the eighteenth century, its new deÞnitions of labor relations, and its burgeoning accounts of local history. Walton calls Monterey Òa rep- resentative showcase of the new politics and economy that deÞned the Mexican periodÓ (p. 62), and he shows how local Indians used the legal system to protect their economic rights, and how new ver- sions of California history shaped local rejection of Mexican con- trol. Turning to the post-Gold Rush era, Walton describes the Ònew property regimeÓ controlled by speculators and railroad tycoons, along with the growing frustrations of CaliforniaÕs working class. He suggests that embittered local Chinese workers may have been re- sponsible for the destructive 1887 Þre at the Del Monte Hotel, and he traces the growing interest in producing public history Òthat rel- egated the Hispanic past to a place of quaint origins now on display to visitorsÓ (p. 172). Turning to years deÞned by industrialization, Storied Land summons the stench of early twentieth-century Þsh canneries and the political conßicts that Òcreated a particular kind of multicultural communityÓ (p. 180). Diverse groups of workers launched labor strikes, and Òby 1939 the Ôold Spanish capitalÕ had become an industrial union townÓ (p. 213). Those transformations in part engendered Òa broad working-class narrativeÓ that embraced wage laborers and shaped John SteinbeckÕs representation of the area (p. 225), a representation close to WaltonÕs heart and one that would prove useful to later civic boosters. The authorÕs Þnal chapter explores Cannery Row since the closing of its plants in the 1950s. Urban renewal clearly evicted working-class residents, pushing is- sues of development to the fore, and Walton emphasizes that Mon- terey has sincemade the area Òa new space of historic re-creation . . . a place where observers are struck by the Ôamount of historyÕ that transpired here and the conspicuous attention to itÓ (p. 249).

Yale University STEPHEN PITTI Rush for Riches: Gold Fever and the Making of California. By J. S. Holli- day. (Berkeley, University of California Press, 1999. xi + 355 pp. $55 cloth, $29.95 paper) Rush for Riches was produced in conjunction with the Oakland Museum of CaliforniaÕs Gold Rush sesquicentennial commemora- tion, serving as a companion piece to its spectacular ÒGold FeverÓ exhibition. Beautifully and abundantly illustrated with imagesÑ drawings, paintings, photographs, cartoonsÑfrom the Þrst Euro- pean contact through the end of hydraulic mining in the 1880s, it elucidates the massive physical, social, and economic changes gold brought to California. J. S. Holliday, who has long been immersed in mining history, argues that CaliforniaÕs rapidly expanding economic power in the late nineteenth century Òsprang from its very freedom from any past, its absence of tradition. Gold had been the catalyst that caused men by the hundreds of thousands to discard status quo for chance, to exchange security for risk, to abolish all the old rules in pursuit of a new futureÓ (p. 303). Holliday has produced an es- sentially entrepreneurial version of CaliforniaÕs historyÑfair enough, since heÕs talking about the mine industry, but in doing so he neglects important countercurrents. To say that California beneÞted from a Òfreedom from any pastÓ is not to say that the Native and Hispanic eras were unimpor- tant, and Holliday does delineate how Anglo newcomers defrauded and displaced the rancheros. However, his economic focus makes him critical of the Californios not only for their mistreatment of the Indians but also for their failure to develop agriculture and trade ca- pable of withstanding Manifest Destiny. He further argues that the militaryÕs inability to control the initial gold excitement presaged a California where all governments, including the one in Washington, D.C., were nearly irrelevant to economic life. Miners and merchants brought law and order to the camps and San Francisco alike, with minersÕ laws and vigilante justice culminating in the BusinessmenÕs Revolution of 1856. In HollidayÕs treatment of the San Francisco Vigilance Committee, the phrases ÒIrish CatholicsÓ and ÒKnow NothingsÓ never appear; ethnicity and national politics are not at is- </page> <page sequence="19"> Reviews of Books 687 sue. San FranciscoÕs WorkingmenÕs Party gets scant attention (the word ÒunionÓ is not in the index), as does the California Constitu- tion passed in 1879 to limit the Òroll-the-diceÓ (p. 147) capitalism he describes. The Òjackpot mentalityÓ that ÒjustiÞed any machines and meth- ods necessaryÓ (p. 147) climaxed in hydraulic mining, which washed away mountainsides, producing tailings that choked rivers and buried farms in the burgeoning Sacramento Valley. The resulting confrontation between hydraulickers and farmers ended the min- ing era. Holliday presents this as a conßict between two groups of capitalists; wheat farmers expressed the same mentality as the mine companies but, by 1881, produced twice the wealth on world mar- kets. The strongest economic interest prevailedÑby using the de- spised legislature and courtsÑand the hydraulic mines ceased, leaving as their legacy an entrepreneursÕ California where the Òim- possible is possibleÓ (p. 304) in agriculture, oil, movies, and, re- cently, information technology. HollidayÕs vividly written narrative makes his case, but many different stories of Gold Rush conse- quences could be told. University of Colorado RALPH MANN Gold: Forgotten Histories and Lost Objects of Australia. Edited by Iain Mc- Calman, Alexander Cook, and Andrew Reeves. (New York, Cam- bridge University Press, 2001. xiv + 314 pp. $65) The discovery of gold in New South Wales and Victoria in 1851 initiated tremendous changes in the Australian colonies. News of the rich Þnds stimulated immigration to Australia on an unprece- dented scale, including the arrival of a substantial Chinese compo- nent, while the discoveries coincided with and contributed to a de- cade of democratic reform in colonial life. Not surprisingly, several generations of historians have focused close attention on the gold rush period of the mid-nineteenth century as the watershed be- tween the convict foundations and the emergence of modern Aus- tralia. Indeed, as the editors of this book suggest, the rushes Òhave attained an iconic status in the pantheon of epic nation-making eventsÓ (p. 2). Gold does not set out to provide a general account of gold in Australia; rather, the book aims to explore the economic, social, and cultural consequences of goldÕs discovery and mining through a se- ries of microhistorical studies. In adopting this approach, the edi- tors explicitly acknowledge the return of narrative to the practice of </page> <page sequence="20"> 688 Paci c Historical Review history, a development they warmly welcome. At the same time, they believe such limited-scale vignettes provide scholars with an oppor- tunity to engage more effectively with the general public. Within this conceptual frame, the twenty essays in the collection are notable for their diverse disciplinary approaches and wide geographic range across the Australian continent. In addition, several of the con- tributions venture well beyond the more familiar mid-nineteenth- century gold rushes to explore twentieth-century experiences. The essays are gathered in Þve sections that deal with the themes of gold and modernity; immigrants and ethnic relations; set- tler and indigenous histories of gold; daily life and domestic culture; and art, visuality, and material culture. Several of the contributions reexamine well-established subjects of historical inquiry, including Graeme DavisonÕs account of gold rush Melbourne and Anne CurthoysÕs look at contacts between European and Chinese diggers. Other chapters open up for scrutiny less charted terrain. These in- clude a stimulating essay by Suzanne Hunt on the cultivation of Òpleasure gardensÓ in Victorian gold towns, their establishment de- signed Òto convey to the rest of the world an image of civilized living and to the individual, a sense of placeÓ (p. 267), and Dorothy Er- icksonÕs chapter on goldÞelds jewelry in Western Australia. This is a beautifully presented book, richly illustrated with pic- tures and photographs of life on the goldÞelds. This is nowheremore evident than in the chapter on Edward SnellÕs diary of the Victorian diggings, by Tom GrifÞths and Alan Platt, where a series of sketches by the English-born engineer are reproduced. Kim McKenzie and Carol Cooper also utilize a series of remarkable drawings by an Ab- original worker to obtain insights on the Palmer River goldÞelds in Queensland in the second half of the nineteenth century. This lavish book should prove stimulating reading for all Aus- tralian historians and will also provide rich insights and fresh per- spectives for historians in the United States and other societies where the discovery of gold precipitated signiÞcant social transformations. University of Auckland MALCOLM CAMPBELL Anaconda: Labor, Community, and Culture in Montana’s Smelter City. By Laurie Mercier. (Urbana, University of Illinois Press, 2001. xi + 300 pp. $49.95 cloth, $24.95 paper) Laurie MercierÕs book Þlls a gap in Western working-class his- tory. Disregarding the well-known stories of the labor wars and radi- cal unions of the era from 1877 to 1919, Mercier shifts our gaze to </page> <page sequence="21"> Reviews of Books 689 the years from the Great Depression and New Deal to deindustrial- ization during the 1970s and 1980s. She also turns our attention away from better-known sites of Western labor wars toward Anaconda. Between the late 1930s and the 1960s Anaconda achieved  an extraordinary level of union density. The heart of MercierÕs  book (chapters 3 Ð5) explains how workers transformed a company- dominated, single-industry Òcity of whispersÓ into a union- inßuenced community in which workersÕ voices resonated loudly and clearly. Anaconda became a place where the word ÒscabÓ served as more than an epithet; to be condemned as a scab after 1937 was to be ostracized absolutely. Not only the smelterÕs labor force, the bulk of the cityÕs workers, but employees in the ancillary and service trades belonged to trade unions that practiced solidarity. Local mer- chants, professionals, and an emerging white-collar salariat sup- ported their co-ethnic and co-Roman Catholic working-class sisters and brothers. A common culture enabled AnacondaÕs workers to practice what Mercier, following Elizabeth Faue, characterizes as Òcommunity unionism,Ó a unionism that incorporated nonworkers and nonunion members into a broader social movement whose aims transcended work-related issues. One of the bookÕs best chap- ters analyzes the Cold War in the smelter workersÕ union and why in Anaconda, alone among MontanaÕs cities, workers chose the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) over the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (IUMMSW). Also following Faue, Mercier suggests that unionism as practiced by the international ofÞcers of the IUMMSW and the USWA marginalized women, thus diluting the success of Òcommunity unionism.Ó Like many other younger historians, Mercier uses gender analysis to strengthen her case. She demonstrates how the smelter workersÕ exaggerated masculinity and their commitment to the principle of the male breadwinner/family wage fractured working- class solidarity. She also alludes to the racial exclusivity of Ana- condaÕs workers and their concern with Òwhiteness.Ó Anaconda was certainly a white manÕs city, but an illustration in the book prob- lematizes the precise meaning of Òwhiteness.Ó A photograph por- trays the African American Charlie Pride, then an East Helena smelterman, beginning his musical career in an Anaconda bar, probably patronized by an all-white, ethnic worker clientele. MercierÕs gender analysis offers readers a new perspective, but it also causes her to neglect important issues. She devotes pages to how the entry of women during World War II into a previously all-male labor force in the smelter caused rifts in the union. Although 95 percent of the wartime smelter workers were men, Mercier neglects to probe how their union served them and the small minority of women on </page> <page sequence="22"> 690 Paci c Historical Review the job. Indeed, we read much about Òcommunity unionismÓ but little about how the smelter workersÕ local administered its contract with the company (Òcontract unionismÓ). While we learn about gender and race, we fail to discover what religion meant to workers who worshiped faithfully in several Roman Catholic parishes and chose overwhelmingly to send their children to parochial schools. Let us, however, be thankful and praise Mercier for what she has chosen to do and has done well. Her book reminds us that the Mountain West of the recent past was a far different place from its contemporary manifestation. Once upon a time not so long ago, Anaconda was home to a major smelter, a militant, unionized work- ing class, and a left-wing Democratic majority, not a high-priced, Jack Nicklaus-designed golf course catering to afßuent citizens drawn to a conservative region. State University of New York, Binghamton MELVYN DUBOFSKY Metropolis in the Making: Los Angeles in the 1920s. Edited by Tom Sit- ton and William Deverell. (Berkeley, University of California Press, 2001. xii + 371 pp. $55 cloth, $22.50 paper) Metropolis in the Making is a collaborative investigation of Los Angeles in the 1920s, that pivotal decade during which the city as- sumed its modern form. As Jules Tygiel explains in the introduction, it was during the 1920s that Los Angeles became the economic and Þnancial anchor of the West, became heavily dependent on the au- tomobile, doubled its population as new waves of migrants ßooded west, and expanded some eighty square miles through the annexa- tion of forty-Þve new communities. Equally important, the 1920s were years in which Southern CaliforniaÕs diverse population deÞnedÑand in some cases explicitly sought to deÞneÑthe unique character of the region. Divided into Þve thematic sections,Metrop- olis in the Making speaks to the diversity of those deÞnitions. The Þrst section, ÒMetropolitan Spaces,Ó presents some of the most exciting new research on Los Angeles. Greg Hise, Becky Nicolaides, and Nancy Quam-Wickham infuse the investigation with a much- needed discussion about the link between industrial work and resi- dence, a link well explored in Chicago, New York and other cities but still curiously underexamined in Los Angeles. Challenging the long-held view that the suburb in Los Angeles and elsewhere was largely a product and symbol of middle-class consumption, both Nicolaides and Quam-Wickham suggest that blue-collar industrial suburbs were more typical of early Los Angeles and that they offered otherwise beleaguered workers exciting opportunities for economic </page> <page sequence="23"> Reviews of Books 691 security and autonomy. These provocative essays should force read- ers to wean themselves from Robert FogelsonÕs classic, Fragmented Metropolis, a superb study of infrastructural growth in Los Angeles, but not one that answers the sorts of questions Hise, Nicolaides, Quam-Wickham, and legions of young Los Angeles scholars are now asking. The second part of the book, ÒMetropolitan Identities,Ó also breaks new ground by exploring the often elusive self-perceptions of the regionÕs diverse populations. In a pithy essay, Douglas Flam- ming explores the fascinating implications of the staging of W. E. B. Du BoisÕs theatrical pageant, the Star of Ethiopia, at the Hollywood Bowl in 1925. Unbeknownst to white observers, the staging and han- dling of the event revealedÑand even exacerbatedÑgenerational and regional Þssures in black America. Clark DavisÕs ÒThe View From Spring Street: White Collar Men in the City of Los AngelesÓ explores a social group about which we know remarkably little, de- spite its overwhelming presence in narratives of the era. Reßexively viliÞed by many contemporary students and scholars, these white corporate workers receive a more nuanced treatment in the hands of Davis, who recognizes the profound ambivalence with which these men approached their careers and lives, despite the relative privilege they enjoyed by virtue of their race and gender. Strong essays on religion, politics, cemeteries, Hollywood, and the Òengineering cultureÓ in Los Angeles round out this excellent collection. As with their earlier collaboration,California Progressivism Revisited, editors Tom Sitton and William Deverell have assembled, and contributed to, an important collection of essays.Metropolis in the Making will be of interest not only to California and Western his- torians but to urban historians as well. California State Polytechnic University, Pomona JOSH SIDES Class Struggle inHollywood, 1930–1950: Moguls,Mobsters, Stars, Reds, &amp; Trade Unionists. By Gerald Horne. (Austin, University of Texas Press, 2001. xiii + 331 pp. $22.95) Gerald HorneÕs Class Struggle in Hollywood presents a detailed account of a series of bitter, violent labor strikes in 1945 and 1946 that rocked the Hollywood Þlm industry. The strikes, and the in- dustry and government reaction to them, released a ßood of anti- union, anticommunist, anti-Semitic, antiliberal hysteria that radi- cally changed the nature of the Hollywood Þlm industry for the next several decades. Anti-unionism was almost a religion in Hollywood. The indus- </page> <page sequence="24"> 692 Paci c Historical Review try was lured to California in the early twentieth century in part be- cause it was a Òright-to-workÓ state. The industry fought unioniza- tion of its workers and formed a company union, the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, to undercut efforts by the Screen Actors Guild and the Screen Writers Guild to organize in the early 1930s. The Los Angeles police departmentÕs ÒRed SquadÓ was infa- mous for busting strikes and strikers. World War II brought a temporary cease-Þre between manage- ment and labor, but by 1945 the unions were determined to strike for better wages and working conditions. The Þrst to do so was the Conference of Studio Unions (CSU), a confederation of craft unions under the leadership of Herb Sorrell. Sorrell was an old-time, tough-minded, 100 percent union man. A militant painter, Sorrell formed the CSU in 1941 and built it to some 10,000 members by the end of World War II. He was not, however, a sophisticated strategist, and Horne maintains that Sor- rell was tricked by the studios into calling a strike that his union could not win. The studio moguls, in collaboration with the rival union, the International Association of Theatrical Stage Employees (IATSE) led by Roy Brewer, immediately labeled Sorrell a commu- nist. Horne states Þrmly that Sorrell Òwas no communist, nor were most of his fellow CSU leadersÓ (p. 175). In fact, Horne illustrates that the Communist Party only very reluctantly backed the CSU. HorneÕs strength is in detailing one of the most complex issues in industry historyÑthe relationship between the studio bosses and the various unions in Hollywood. The IATSE did not support the CSU nor did the Teamsters, who even drove scabs through CSU picket lines! The CSU strike split the Screen Actors GuildÑJohn GarÞeld, Harpo Marx, Joan Crawford, and other liberals refused to cross the picket lines, while Ronald Reagan, Mickey Rooney, Red Skelton, Clark Gable, and others crossed the lines. Only one Hollywood union, the Screen Writers Guild, came to the support of the CSU. Reluctant at Þrst, the SWG worked relent- lessly for the CSU and in so doing infuriated the studio bosses. But the CSU was out-manned and out-ßanked and by 1947 was throughly defeated. It was in that year that the House Un-American Activities Committee turned its attention to the radicals in the SWG. The blacklisting of progressives in the industry had begun. HorneÕs study is a fascinating and, at times, provocative account of the violent strikes and the colorful charactersÑMickey Cohen, Roy Brewer, Sorrell, Reagan, Jack WarnerÑwho fought for control of the industry in the late 1940s and early 1950s. His point is well taken that the blacklisting period that followed the CSU strike was </page> <page sequence="25"> Reviews of Books 693 more about union busting than about discovering communists.

(Lawrence, University Press of Kansas, 2001. xvi + 318 pp. $35) Among the most signiÞcant yet little-known aspects of  nineteenth-century American environmental history is the vital role that the U.S. Army played in the early stages of the conservation movement. For over thirty years, armed cavalry patrolled Yellow- stone, Yosemite, and other national parks, leading John Muir to  enthuse that ÒUncle SamÕs soldiers . . . [are] the most effective for- est police.Ó Only in 1918 would the army relinquish its position as the guardian of AmericaÕs parks to the newly created National Park Service. Unlike the pioneering work on this curiously understudied topicÑH. Duane HamptonÕsHow the U.S. Cavalr y Saved Our National Parks (1971)ÑNature’s Army presents itself as a case study of a speciÞc park, Yosemite, under army management. Yet rather than treating readers to a close-grained analysis of army policies in the Yosemite valley, MeyersonÕs book instead takes up subjects as far aÞeld as the origins of the U.S. Army and the place of dance and drill in the military in an attempt to make a larger point about the character of the ÒOld ArmyÓÑnamely, that army ofÞcers hewed to an ethic of self-sacriÞce, patriotism, and community interest that placed them outside the Òdominant self-seeking valuesÓ (p. 23) of the nineteenth-century American mainstream. As a corollary to this argument, Meyerson contends that the army was not just an efÞcient administrator of the parks but was, in fact, at the forefront of enlightened environmental thought in the nineteenth century. According to Nature’s Army, army ofÞcers were Òsensual natural scientistsÓ (p. 227) who saw the military as Òa pro- tector of nature against the excesses of Western progress, an educa- tor of AmericaÕs individualistic civilizers on the social need for self- restraint, and an educator of inward human nature as wellÓ (p. 226). Indeed, in MeyersonÕs reckoning, only the draft-dodging John Muir and the Native American communities that were the armyÕs fre- quent opponents in the 1800s appear to have been the militaryÕs equals as environmental thinkers. ÒOld Army soldiers and American Indian warriors had much in common in their relationship with a so-called natural world that had been devalued by Western civiliza- </page> <page sequence="26"> 694 Paci c Historical Review tion during its redemptive ascent to world power,Ó claims Meyerson in his introduction. ÒThe Old Army was, at heart, a drumbeating pa- gan institutionÓ (p. xi). To be sure, there are some important points to be made here about the links between nationalism and concern for nature, the crucial role that national parks have played in creating an ÒAmeri- canÓ landscape, and the evolving administrative powers of the  nineteenth-century American state. But they are often lost amid MeyersonÕs strained attempts to cast his narrative as a tale of a virtu- ous military riding to natureÕs rescue. This heroic portrayal, drawn largely from the writings of a handful of ofÞcers assigned to Yo- semite, gives little sense of how the enlisted men in the army ap- proached their new tasks as guardians of nature or how nearby com- munities (including YosemiteÕs Indian population, who receive only a one-line mention in Nature’s Army) responded to the unprece- dented military presence in their midst. Moreover, it leaves unex- plored essential questions about the appropriateness of military control of the environment in a democratic society and of equating conservation to a military campaign. MeyersonÕs single-minded focus on the army also prevents Na- ture’s Army from analyzing the effects that the military had on its civilian successors. Readers get surprisingly little sense of whether the National Park Service emulated or rejected the precedents es- tablished by the army. AlthoughNature’s Army is a valuable reminder of an important chapter in western and environmental history, the deÞnitive work on the militaryÕs supervision of the national parks re- mains to be written. Brown University KARL JACOBY Warm Sands: Uranium Mill Tailings Policy in the Atomic West. By Eric W. Mogren. (Albuquerque, University of New Mexico Press, 2002. x + 241 pp. $34.95) After skimming the Þrst Þfty pages of Eric MogrenÕs cleverly titled book,Warm Sands, which unnecessarily rehash the dawn of the Atomic Age, readers will soon discover that this detailed account of U.S. uranium tailings policy over the past half-century is a welcome addition to any bookshelf devoted to American nuclear politics. In- deed, there are only a few among the many atomic books published since 1980 that address the uranium issue. Of those, most focus pri- marily on the miners and their protracted battle for compensation; see Stewart UdallÕs The Myths of August and Howard BallÕs Cancer  </page> <page sequence="27"> Reviews of Books 695 Factories, for example. Others, like Luther CarterÕs Nuclear Impera- tives and the Public Trust and Donald BartlettÕs and James SteeleÕs Forevermore: Nuclear Waste in America, are directed toward waste pol- icy, but they too shortchange the tailings issue and tend to concen- trate instead on the more pressing issues of high level waste and cleaning up AmericaÕs ÒsacriÞce zones,Ó such as Hanford and the Nevada Test Site. Theunderlying theme ofMogrenÕs book is that, because the fed- eral government was responsible for the tailings pollution, it was the most appropriate entity to undertake its management and remedia- tion. However, because of certain structural factors, it had great difÞculty doing so. This message is borne out as Mogren chronicles the history of tailings policy from 1948, when the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Þrst announced a uranium ore-buying pro- gram, until 1998, when the Department of Energy celebrated com- pletion of the Uranium Mill Tailings Remedial Action (UMPRA) Project, the worldÕs largest materiels management effort ever con- ducted. Approved by Congress in 1978, the project over twenty years removed and secured nearly 40 million cubic yards of low-level ra- dioactive uranium mill tailings from eleven states, enough material to bury 2,300 football Þelds in ten feet of Òwarm sand.Ó This account of tailings policy reads much like other atomic stories, such as those of the downwinders and Yucca Mountain. Many of the acronyms are the same. And certainly similar conßicts plague the policymaking process in all three cases, prolonging it and rendering it less than adequate in many respects. There are constant battles between the private and public sectors, the industry ad- vocates and the regulators. Meanwhile, local, state, and federal  governments simultaneously vie for beneÞts and attempt to shirk re- sponsibility. Interagency battles rage over jurisdiction as counter- vailing legislative and judicial actions stymie progress. National se- curity competes with economic development and public health for priority status. And exacerbating the difÞculties are the imperatives of cost and time. Mogren does a good job of documenting and an- alyzing these complex dynamics. In sum, MogrenÕs book may not be as provocative as some of the more personalized accounts, but it deÞnitely plugs a hole in the academic literature on this subject. It is neither as sympathetic to- ward government as ofÞcially sanctioned Òguided research,Ó nor as critical of policymakers as the current spate of antinuke polemics. But it does make the reader stop to think about the potential costs of this nationÕs accelerating energy demands. University of Nevada, Las Vegas A. COSTANDINA TITUS </page> <page sequence="28"> 696 Paci c Historical Review Changing Tracks: Predators and Politics in Mt. McKinley National Park. By Timothy Rawson. (Fairbanks, University of Alaska Press, 2001.  xiv + 326 pp. $49.95 cloth, $24.95 paper) Today wolves are often depicted as icons of wilderness and American freedom; they are the cherished stars of childrenÕs books, and their image a favorite souvenir for tourists. Although a new gen- eration of Americans may assume that wolves are the quintessence of nature and an essential part of a functioning ecosystem, this view, according to Timothy Rawson, is a new and signiÞcant phenome- non in American history. Prior to the 1960s the wolf had few friends and a host of powerful enemies. Throughout American history, wolves were cast in the role of anthropomorphic villain, aberrations of nature that thrived on wanton murder and destruction. These perceptions of wolves were found not only in popular literature and childrenÕs storybooks but also deeply embedded in the policies and practices of AmericaÕs land management agencies and the National Park Service (NPS) in particular. This pervasive sentiment led to the wholesale elimination of wolves from most of AmericaÕs national parks by the middle of the twentieth century. RawsonÕs thoroughly researched and well-written book focuses on changing perceptions of wolves in the NPS and in American culture and discusses how these changes reßected larger trends in environmental thinking. Rawson uses a focused and insightful case study of the wolf- sheep controversy in AlaskaÕs Mt. McKinley National Park to illus- trate how generational tensions, changing political climates, and contested science about predators and predation helped to deÞne NPS policies and shape national debates about wildlife and envi- ronmental management between the early 1930s and today. In the process, Rawson reveals the life and work of NPS biologist Adolph Murie, Olas MurieÕs lesser-known younger brother. Adolph MurieÕs pioneering work in wildlife management has been recorded by other historians but never with such depth. Rawson convincingly ar- gues that the younger MurieÕs work in Alaska was as signiÞcant as his brotherÕs in contributing to changing American perceptions about conservation and wildlife management. The sections of the book dealing with Adolph Murie alone make a signiÞcant contribution to the history of American conservation. Rawson divides his study into nine well-rounded chapters, all aimed at unraveling the speciÞcs of the wolf-sheep controversy in Mt. McKinley while situating this case study in predator manage- ment controversy in a broad context of shifting environmental pol- itics and generational conßicts. The book succeeds at both the speciÞc and general levels. The Mt. McKinley wolf-sheep contro- </page> <page sequence="29"> Reviews of Books 697 versy is signiÞcant and deserves the thorough telling it gets in this book. While some of the broader discussions of evolving NPS and Bureau of Biological Survey policies and general descriptions of American cultural assumptions about nature and civilization cover familiar ground, Rawson does an excellent job of keeping his nar- rative focused by concentrating on Alaskan examples of broader trends. Changing Tracks breaks new ground and reveals startling in- sights about events and characters that have never received their due in previous histories. University of Nevada, Las Vegas ANDREW KIRK Fragile Paradise: The Impact of Tourism on Maui, 1959–2000. By Man- sel Blackford. (Lawrence, University Press of Kansas, 2001. xiii +  277 pp. $35) In Maui people can get very agitated about the specter of the brown tree snake. These innocuous-sounding reptiles traveled from their original homes in New Guinea, parts of Indonesia, and the Sol- omon Islands on the underbellies of military cargo planes and settled in Guam, where they enjoyed a life without predators and feasted on local birds, chickens, ducks, rabbits, and pets. They turned nine of GuamÕs twelve bird species into distant memories and caused all sorts of trouble when they shorted out transformers. MauiÕs growth as a tourist spot and its corresponding increase in in- ternational air trafÞc got inhabitants so frightened about this in- vader that by the 1990s they had state and federal agencies cooper- ating in a three-pronged line of defense, which included the use of SWAT (Snake Watch Alert Teams) to Þnd and kill any brown tree snake that might have arrived (pp. 79, 187). The snake appears only brießy in Mansel BlackfordÕs Fragile Paradise, but it encapsulates the bookÕs themes as well as its poten- tial. Blackford tells the story of MauiÕs growing dependence upon tourism and its simultaneous struggle for a diversiÞed economy. He describes the people, organizations, interest groups, government agencies, and coalitions that took positions on issues including land use, water rights, electrical power, and airport expansion. The rise of grassroots environmental and Native Hawaiian rights groups il- lustrate a growing ambivalence about the beneÞts of tourist devel- opment on Maui, but these movements do not change the impres- sion that practically everyone he mentions had some hand in MauiÕs seemingly unstoppable growth. Turning SWAT loose on the airport represented a compromise between prohibiting ßights from Guam (which really no one wanted) and the embrace of all tourist-Þlled </page> <page sequence="30"> 698 Paci c Historical Review planes possible. Blackford uses this history to argue that economic, environmental, and political issues are interconnected, that issues surrounding tourism and its development are complex, and that MauiÕs example supports Hal RothmanÕs characterization of western tourism as a devilÕs bargain. Blackford shows readers the costs of tourism development, but just what is at stake is unclear. He recognizes that Maui has had a his- tory of economic development before tourism that also carried signiÞcant consequences for native environments, people, and cul- ture, but he insists that tourism put a traditional ÒlifestyleÓ at risk. Identifying this Òway of lifeÓ and examining just how tourism en- dangered it are clearly not BlackfordÕs priority. Given a different framework, however, his story could reorient views on tourism in  important ways. He could embrace the brown tree snake phenom- enon, for instance, and turn this into a good book about island tourism. Islands present their inhabitants and governments with special problems stemming from their diverse yet fragile ecosys- tems, their isolated animal and human populations, and their dis- tance from both raw materials and economic markets. That is why the snake posed such a threat and why locals had to continually risk its introduction. BlackfordÕs book makes the most immediate sense, however, as a political microhistory. His discussion of federal, state, local, and interest group machinations dominates the narrative and raises interesting questions about how views of tourism change when its costs become apparent. Blackford concludes that tourism will continue to grow on Maui, but it will do so through an increasingly sticky and drawn out political process. Indiana University- Purdue University, Indianapolis ANNIE GILBERT COLEMAN The Embarrassment of Slaver y: Controversies over Bondage and National- ism in the American Colonial Philippines. By Michael Salman. (Berke- ley, University of California Press, 2001. xi + 335 pp. $45) In the wake of the Spanish-American War (1898Ð1899), the United States emerged as a major imperial and colonial power. It annexed the Philippines, in addition to taking possession of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and Guam. Imposition of colonial rule in the Philip- pines proved difÞcult and costly, as it coincided with a Filipino revolt against Spanish rule. The Philippine insurrection raged for over three years, claiming the lives of 4,200 Americans, 15,000 rebel troops, and 200,000 Filipino civilians. Hence, from its incep- tion, colonial rule in the Philippines posed troubling dilemmas for </page> <page sequence="31"> Reviews of Books 699 conscientious Americans and provoked divisive debates regarding the morality of AmericaÕs colonial presence in the western PaciÞc. Early on, one of these debates focused on the existence of slavery among the Muslim societies (Moro) of the southern Philippines. Pro-imperialists argued that colonialism would free Filipinos from various forms of slavery, whereas anti-imperialists asserted that colo- nialism itself represented a new form of slavery. Adding another layer of complexity to the debate, Filipino nationalists appropriated antislavery discourse to attack colonialism in both its Spanish and American varieties and to support national liberation. Salman analyzes the various controversies surrounding the is- sue of slavery in the American colonial Philippines, delving in depth into discourse analysis as a means of determining, as he puts it, Òwhy Americans and Filipino nationalists who had no direct economic in- terests at stake cared so much about what should be denoted as slav- eryÓ (p. 3). Salman tries to answer that question by placing these slavery debates into a broader global and comparative perspective, with wide-ranging discussions regarding the meanings of slavery, abolition, colonialism, and nationalism. His book is divided into three parts: an examination of the problem of slavery that shaped early debates over colonial rule in the Philippines; an exploration of the American colonial encounter with Moro slavery; and an exege- sis on the connections among Philippine nationalism, antislavery ideology, and American colonial hegemony. Despite its bold approach, SalmanÕs endeavor to deconstruct the ÒmetaphoricsÓ of slavery, to link the Òglobalization of national- ismÓ with the spread of antislavery as a Òhegemonic ideology,Ó and to demonstrate how Filipinos ÒnaturalizedÓ antislavery discourse to emancipate themselves from colonial rule suffers from its bewilder- ing jargon. Relatively grounded in his early chapters on the formu- lation of U.S. colonial policy in the Philippines, SalmanÕs mono- graph later degenerates into a labyrinth of rhetorical obfuscation. For example, when he argues that ÒPhilippine nationalism exterior- ized the negative dimensions of slavery and thereby opened a new discourse about domestic submission and hierarchyÓ (p. 259), what does Salman mean? After reading this book, does one have a better understanding of Òthe metaphorics of slavery and emancipation in early Philippine nationalist discourseÓ (p. 21)? Perhaps, but quite often the reader is perplexed. Hence, whether this study advances our understanding of the global history of slavery and colonialism remains an open question.

(Durham, N.C., Duke Uni- versity Press, 2001. vi + 462 pp. $19.95) Perilous Memories represents an important contribution to on- going debates concerning World War II and its legacies. This collec- tion of essays introduces hitherto marginalized ground-level per- spectives on the mid-century struggle between Japan and the Allies as it ravaged and remade the Asia-PaciÞc region. More than an aca- demic exercise, the task the editors set themselves is Òto remind our- selves that the Ôstate of emergencyÕ did not conclude with the cease- Þre or with formal decolonization. Instead, it has persisted into the present, even as most people of the dominant powers imagine that the world was made safe by the warÕs endingÓ (p. 21). While a reader of the proposal for this volume apparently expressed concern that this focus would obscure our understanding of the perpetrators of the PaciÞc War, the editors pointedly respond that, since the Òvoices of victims and victimizers are necessarily intertwinedÓ (p. 4), grasp- ing the big picture demands a close examination of what has been suppressed as well as what has been foregrounded in the warÕs meta- narratives. ÒMemory as methodÓ acts as the conceptual framework to bind together the essays, which deal with topics ranging from Japanese American internment and African American responses to the PaciÞc War to Taiwanese and Korean service in the Japanese im- perial army and the contested meaning of ÒliberationÓ in South- east Asia. This is not to say, however, that memory plays the same role in each essay: Direct testimonials occupy one end of the spec- trum, while more abstract examinations of the operations of mem- ory occupy the other. How, then, does memory provide a unifying method? While in the end memory serves more as inspiration or model than method in some of the essays, the editors eloquently make the following case: Ò[W]e are interested in exploring the pro- cesses through which past events acquire truthfulness and power by virtue of being represented, shared, debated, suppressed, and ne- gotiated. By conceiving of memory in this way, we begin to see the complex and ßuid relationships between what are identiÞed as facts and their meanings, between historical knowledge and the struc- tures of power and desire within which they are enmeshedÓ (pp. 20Ð21). The fresh materials and approach will attract and offer satis- faction to a wide scholarly readership. Moreover, given the clarity of the language and reasonable length of most of the essays, Perilous Memories would be suitable for use in college classrooms. A minor </page> <page sequence="33"> Reviews of Books 701 complaint is that the separation of the essays into three general sec- tions entitled ÒMemory Fragments, Memory Images,Ó ÒPolitics and Poetics of Liberation,Ó and ÒAtonement, Healing, and Unexpected AlliancesÓ is not terribly compelling. Perhaps because these cate- gories are a bit broad and vague, several of the essays seem as though they could Þt equally well or better in a different section. Re- organization by topic, region, or approach to memory could put some of the essays in more vigorous dialogue with one another. Daqing YangÕs superb essay on evolving views on the Nanjing Mas- sacre in the PeopleÕs Republic of China, Taiwan, and Japan springs to mind as a piece that might be better served by being read in close conjunction with Lisa YoneyamaÕs thoughtful interrogation of ap- peals to ÒfacticityÓ in the Smithsonian controversy. However, this is a small criticism intended to suggest ways in which professors might regroup these essays in the classroom. University of California, Santa Cruz NORIKO ASO Inter - Allied Conicts and Ocean Law, 1945–53: The Occupation Com- mand’s Revival of Japanese Whaling and Marine Fisher ies. By Harry N. Scheiber. (Taipei, Taiwan, Institute of European and American Studies, Academia Sinica, 2001. x + 233 pp. No price currently  available). In Inter- Allied Conicts and Ocean Law, 1945–53: The Occupation Command’s Revival of Japanese Whaling and Marine Fisheries, noted le- gal historian Harry N. Scheiber adds another important chapter to his ongoing analysis of the development of ocean law and policy in the twentieth century. Readers seeking to better understand how and why the current legal regime, born of the 1945 Truman presi- dential proclamations on the continental shelf and high seas Þshing, and now embodied in the 1982 U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea, will Þnd ScheiberÕs book an invaluable resource. Scheiber, cofounder of the Ocean Governance Study Group, has written extensively on the history and development of ocean law, with particular attention to the PaciÞc region. Drawing on a variety of historical sources, including interviews, personal papers, and gov- ernment archives, this most recent work focuses on the role of the Occupation Command in revivingÑeven championingÑthe Japa- nese Þshing and whaling industries between 1945 and 1953. The book is organized into an introduction, Þve substantive chapters, and Þve appendices. The authorÕs carefully documented analysis of the historical record depicts the ofÞce of the Supreme Commander, </page> <page sequence="34"> 702 Paci c Historical Review Allied Powers in Occupied Japan (ÒSCAPÓ) under Gen. Douglas McArthur as virtually an irresistible force that alienated U.S. allies by allowing Japan to rebuild and even extend its distant water Þshing and whaling ßeets. The restored Japanese Þshing ßeets were there- after in a position to compete directly with ßeets from the recover- ing allied nations, including Australia, New Zealand, the Philip- pines, Great Britain, Norway, and JapanÕs closer neighbors, the Republic of China and South Korea. Perhaps more important for modern opponents of whaling, among whom Scheiber would likely include himself, SCAPÕs unilateral decision to permit Japan to re- sume whaling in the Southern Ocean, despite what Scheiber docu- ments as a deplorable record in the prewar years, likely undermined the conservation and management goals of the ßedgling Interna- tional Whaling Commission. ScheiberÕs book is a welcome contribution to the ocean legal history literature. For some, it will provide access to important records relevant to an examination of the legitimacy of contempo- rary Japanese high seas Þshing and whaling claims. Others will Þnd in this book evidence of the enduring power of a few individualsÑ particularly William Herrington and the pioneering Þsheries con- servation advocate Wilbert ChapmanÑto reshape dramatically the law and practice of marine resource conservation and management. ScheiberÕs book may also serve as the foundation for further analy- sis of the MacArthur-SCAP economic policies in the larger context of the Soviet annexation of Eastern Europe, the revolution in China, the Cold War, and its ßare-up in the Korean Conßict. It is apparent from ScheiberÕs work that these changes in the postwar geopolitical scene, together with EuropeÕs dependence on the Marshall Plan, to a large extent explain the alliesÕ reluctance to challenge directly the U.S. decision to develop JapanÕs Þshing industry as one element in a plan to restore Japan as an economically viable power aligned with the anti-Soviet bloc. As the Cold War era gives way to the twenty-Þrst century, perhaps it is time to reexamine the wisdom of perpetuating Cold War concepts, including the freedom to Þsh on the high seas subject only to ßag state control or to take whales in the name of ÒscientiÞcÓ research, despite the global moratorium on whaling that has been in place since 1986.

(Ithaca, N.Y., Cornell University Press, 2000. xxix + 337 pp. $55 cloth, $19.95 paper) Cultural analysis of foreign policymaking is not new, as works  by Morrell Heald, Lawrence Kaplan, and Akire Iriye, among oth- ers, demonstrate. RaceÑa cultural categoryÑhas an especially long pedigree, being commonplace in studies about U.S. imperial- ism and the response to European colonialism. But seldom has there been such a thoughtful, even inspired, study of the cultural underpinnings of diplomacy as this, and never on American policy toward South Asia. Moreover the book explores how the cultural im- peratives of both the United States and India inßuenced the diplo- macy of both. The book recalls Mark Philip BradleyÕs Imagining Viet- nam, Imagining America, although Bradley devotes more attention to Vietnam than Andrew Rotter does to India. Comrades at Odds is also engagingly written, a pleasure to read. In a pathbreaking article in 1994, Rotter used gender analysis to explore American policy toward South Asia. The United States viewed India as feminine, Pakistan as masculine. When Jawaharlal Nehru visited the United States in 1949, he wore a Òdress,Ó had a rose in his lapel, did not drink, and disliked reviewing the troops. Liaquat Ali Khan wore a business suit, drank easily, and loved reviewing the troops. As a consequence, Rotter argued, the Americans were drawn toward Pakistan rather than India. InComrades at Odds, Rotter expands his analysis of diplomacy to include several cultural categories. He challenges the theory that all states will react similarly to like situations. Because India and the United States had different Òstrategic culturesÓ (p. 40), for example, they approached the Cold War very differently. Similarly, different cultures resulted in dissimilar views of trade, investment, and aid. In addition to strategy, economics, and gender, Rotter exam- ines the two nationsÕ views of governance, race, religion, and the Ògestures of diplomacyÓ (p. 249). His most innovative analysis in- volves different ideas of governance. Governance, he argues, derives from models of family life, and different models produce different foreign policies. This is an intriguing argument, although the two examples he cites to show that these differences affected actual di- plomacy are more suggestive than fully persuasive. The chapters on race, religion, and ÒgesturesÓ are replete with insightful observa- tions and demonstrate that Americans viewed Indians as racially and religiously inferior (Hindus were polytheistic), immature, and dis- orderly, all of which inßuenced diplomacy. The Americans also </page> <page sequence="36"> 704 Paci c Historical Review failed to understand the importance of diplomatic ÒgesturesÓ to In- dians. The Indians themselves had conßicted notions of race and sometimes failed to appreciate American good intentions. If Indo-American relations were not good, they were not disas- trous either. Rotter explains well how this could be, despite cultural values that were often very different. Sometimes both countries saw events from similar vantage points, and some American diplomats and public Þgures were less culture-bound and had some grasp of Indian psychology (notably Chester Bowles). A few minor quibbles: The author might have consulted Carl JacksonÕs prize-winning book for earlier images of India and noted earlier studies about race and diplomacy. His assertion that Indians disliked American soldiers stationed in India during World War II  is debatable. But, in sum, this is a wonderful book, an excellent complement to recent but more traditional accounts of postwar American relations with South Asia by Robert McMahon and  Dennis Merrill.
