Washington, DC: Dumbarton Oaks Publications, 2003, 428 pp. $30.00, cloth. The pre-Columbian culture area commonly known as Lower Central America or the Intermediate Area is less well known than either of its imposing neighbors, Mesoamerica or Andean South America. Its great legacy of gold objects dates from about AD 200 to the time of contact, and this collection of papers from the 1999 Dumbarton Oaks Pre-Columbian Studies Conference uses these objects, their iconographic significance, and their techniques of manufacture to reveal much about the cultures that produced them. Jeffrey Quilter's "Introduction: The Golden Bridge of the Darien" notes that between 1503 and 1660, about 185 metric tons of gold were exported from the Americas to Spain, fueling "the Counter-Reformation and the Spanish Armada" (p. 1). Thus this region, Spain's first taste of the riches of the New World, figured importantly in world history because of the consequences of this wealth. In "'Catching the Light': Technologies of Power and Enchantment in Pre- Columbian Goldworking," Nicholas Saunders explores the indigenous value placed on materials that expressed brilliance as "concretizations of light and light- laden natural phenomena" (p. 16), which conceptually allied gold with the sun. Native Americans valued the smell, sound, and feel of gold and other metals (such as copper-gold guanin), and these features represented a cosmological creative power that could be appropriated and exploited by the elite for sacred and political purposes.

Important motifs- shamans in conical caps with double-spiral wands, the double-headed saurian, Crocodile and Bat Men-were widely shared. However, environmental differences split the region into zones that contributed to the development of regional "core cosmologies." Richard Cooke, Ilean Isaza, John Griggs, Benoit Desjardins, and Luis Alberto Sainchez investigate "Who Crafted, Exchanged, and Displayed Gold in Pre- Columbian Panama?" From ore sources and archaeological evidence of objects and their method of manufacture, they conclude that the technology was probably brought to the area and then adopted, with production occurring near the sources. Mines may have been the property of local chiefs. Panama's Sitio Conte (AD 750- 950) provides the best archaeological evidence of patterns of use, with high- ranking males buried with pendants, cuffs, ear rods, and bells. The transition "From Jade to Gold in Costa Rica: How, Why, and When" is discussed by Michael Snarskis, who reviews the jade-based evidence for interaction with Mesoamerica, mostly dating from the Late Formative period. Jade working waned in Costa Rica by AD 500, with gold working well-established by AD 600. Using the local distinction between "above" (brilliance, the sun, maleness) and "below" (water, vegetation, femaleness) principles, Snarskis elucidates the respective cosmological value of gold and jade. "Metallurgy, Balls, and Stone Statuary in the Diqufs Delta, Costa Rica: Local Production of Power Symbols" by Patricia Fernandez and Ifigenia Quintanilla investigates the association of monumental stone sculpture and gold with large settlements that date from AD 800 to 1550. The enigmatic stone spheres (largest, 2.5 m in diameter, 15 tons) required considerable labor for manufacturing and moving into position. They and anthropomorphic peg-based statues were part of public display, while gold objects conferred status upon individuals. In "The Political Economy of Pre-Columbian Gold Work: Four Examples from Northern South America," Carl Langebaek compares evidence from the development of chiefdoms in four regions. Locally produced gold objects imitated styles from other regions, allowing local chiefs to secure their positions as "intermediaries with the outside world" (p. 267). As these cultures evolved, gold ornaments were more widely used by the general population. Mark Graham's "Creation Imagery in the Goldwork of Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia" uses hermaphroditic imagery on gold pendants to explore creation mythology in ancient Central America. Graham surveys ethnohistorical and ethnographic sources from northern South America and Mesoamerican archaeological themes to explore the fusion of male and female sexual characteristics, suggesting that this served as an expression of power. "Gold, Stone, and Ideology: Symbols of Power in the Tairona Tradition of Northern Colombia" by Warwick Bray returns to themes of diffusion among neighboring cultures, reviewing archaeological and ethnohistorical sources to Journal of Anthropological Research, vol. 60, 2004</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 615 develop a culture history for this region, positing a late arrival (AD 600) of Chibchan speakers into Colombia. In "The Seed of Life: The Symbolic Power of Gold-Copper Alloys and Metallurgical Transformations," Ana Maria Falchetti draws attention to the mutable quality of alloys. The Western emphasis upon gold's immutability contrasts with indigenous values that stressed the brilliance of metal and even the desirability of the capability of alloys to tarnish, the transformation evidencing animism. Eugenia Ibarra's essay, "Gold in the Everyday Lives of Indigenous Peoples of Sixteenth-Century Southern Central America," reviews evidence for the role of gold in long-distance trade-including with Mesoamerica-as well as the association of different gold objects with different members of the civil and religious hierarchies extant in the region at the time of Spanish intrusion. This is an important volume, bringing together a wealth of sources to elucidate relations of power, both political and spiritual, as well as evolution of societies in this region. These studies provide welcome insights and information for this area, showing the dynamic role that lower Central America played in the culture history of the New World.
