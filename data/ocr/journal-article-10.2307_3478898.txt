<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PREDICAMENT OF DEMOCRATIC MAN. By Edmund Cahn.' New York: The Macmillan Company. 1961. Pp. 194. $3.95. In the columns of the Parisian daily Le Figaro on November 30, 1961, we find: "Everywhere the old modes of popular representation seem to disintegrate. Almost everywhere the parliamentary method loses its prestige. The Anglo-Saxon and Nordic countries are protected by their traditions of individual freedom. These traditions are, alas, much less solid in the Latin and Germanic countries." This is, I believe, a significant confession coming from one of the leading French news- papers. The continent of Europe does not have the political stability of the Anglo- Saxon world.2 One can say that Professor Cahn's book was written to consolidate even more strongly the democratic values of the Anglo-Saxon world through an accounting of their defects. But its content has a universal character as well and deserves international attention, for it is concerned with the responsibility of the democratic man. The book is built around two elements. In its starting point lies a factual thesis: a democratic nation has its limitations, and one of these is the occasional con- demnation of the innocent. Having stated this point very firmly and corroborated it through striking examples, the author launches into the development of the main question: To what extent is the citizen of a democratic nation responsible for the abuses of an authority that his vote has installed in power? This consti- tutes the major part of the book. It is developed at length and in my opinion with great talent. I have nothing but admiration for the main purpose and content of the book, although it is not in all places equally convincing. It strikes the reader from the start that Professor Cahn has a much greater concern for the innocent victim of the judge's decision than for the eventual victim of an ex-convict or of a convict released on parole. One can object, of course, that more than once a defendant has been victimized by the police, judge, and press clamoring to find a man responsible for the crime. This is true indeed, and nothing is more regrettable, but the other side might very well retort that there are enough cases where the convict, truly guilty, was released too early and became a definite threat to the innocent citizen who, no less than "Joe," innocent victim of an erro- neous trial, is an individual with his own rights of safety and protection. From a world of innocent victims Mr. Cahn seems to have made a choice, but in choosing 1 Professor of Law, New York University. 2 In the same copy, though, Le Figaro points out that notwithstanding its political instabil- ity the Continent has done much better than its English counterpart in the realm of economics.</page><page sequence="2">19621 BOOK REVIEWS 185 so clearly, he has excluded some. No wonder then that our author prefers Justices Warren, Douglas, and Black to Justice Frankfurter. This is his full right, a demo- cratic right, and I should add, a right of preference. Professor Cahn, furthermore, is firmly opposed to the comparison of the state to an organic anthropomorphic entity. He calls this approach obsolete, because a state does not conform to the human life cycle; it may renew its youth when a man cannot; it may prosper indefinitely at stages when a man must decline or it may decline and dissolve for causes which would leave a man untouched. Unlike a man's body, the "body politic" cannot be conceived or generated once for all. Its destiny must depend on continual acts of new creation and new revelation.3 Personally, I must confess that his argument here does not seem convincing. Can I not say that states are partly induced by external circumstances, like bodies get- ting their shape through external pressures? Is it so obvious that only living bodies are replaceable and are indeed replaced, while states are perpetual? To me, states share the fate of human operation-history confirms that point. They are replace- able, and whatever one may think of a democratic structure-we all hope and pray that it may stay-it is in itself not an absolute and shares the fragility of all ter- restrial performance. And finally, is it not true that both an organic structure and the state have an element of diversification? This is not meant to be a defense of the state as being some kind of hyperorganism-on this I would agree with Pro- fessor Cahn-but it can stand comparison with it. Our semantics do not change the nature of the state, but the use of an analogy with the realm of the biological may serve to underline the fact that the state is not an atomistic structure of juxta- posed individuals. To this I should like to attach another incidental remark: Does an organic conception of the state necessarily conflict with the theory Professor Cahn pro- poses as its replacement? This theory is called the consumer theory. Its main characteristic consists, in the words of Professor Cahn, "in examining, judging and assuming responsibility for what our representatives do in our name and by our authority."4 This is a good statement, and it reflects very well the spirit of democracy, but a democracy could stand an organic metaphor without falling into the extremes of king adoration. This is so even though Professor Cahn believes the organic theory inevitably leads to the kingly pronouncement that "L'etat c'est moi," thus murdering any life in collective and individual citizen-responsibility. Perhaps the author has underlined more than is necessary the opposition of the organic and consumer theory, for a reconciliation between both need not be neces- sarily excluded. The responsibility that is ours in a democratic society should not take, our author goes on to say, the form of regret or remorse or of any other emotional manifestation, but should be active. We should be "acting out responsibility in the form of prevention, reparation and protest.""" There is a lot to say in favor of this. I wish, however, that Professor Cahn would make it clearer still that all this activ- ity rests upon clearly chosen responsibility, and that responsibility for him does not mean conditioned reaction, but demands free choice. This is, I believe, Professor Cahn's intention, but I did not find it very clearly formulated. I should like to add, furthermore, that absence of guilt and remorse actually implies absence of partici- 3 CAHN, THE PREDICAMENT OF DEMOCRATIC MAN 22-23 (1961).

However much we applaud our democratic institutions, let us be sincere enough to state that they are primitive, and they are still primitive because our participation as individuals is weak. I participate through the vote for my candi- date, but once elected, he to a great extent escapes my control. Even in our times, and in an advanced democracy, my participation in the actual lawmaking is limited. Exploiting Professor Cahn's beautiful distinction between the "inner chamber" and the "outer chamber,"6 and calling the inner chamber man's innermost and most personal convictions, may we not say that, in later days, man's "inner cham- ber" will get a more explicit hearing and a more direct participation in the govern- ment of a nation of free men? If and when this self-expression acquires a more powerful form-how this will or could be done cannot now be explained-would my reaction then at times not be one of regret or of remorse even? One cannot really participate and share a responsibility without sometimes regretting the result of one's decision. It is an open question whether some day in the future our representative form of government will become a real democracy. These remarks--needless to say-are not aimed at diminishing the value of Mr. Cahn's book. It is a superior work. Only that which deserves our respect is worthy of our critique. Wilfrid Desan* 6 Professor Cahn says: [T]he "outer chamber" of citizenship ... [is] the area of responsibility that includes all adult citizens without regard to distinctions and differences among them. The outer chamber is the place of collective responsibilities. Through it one must pass before he is equipped to consider his position in the "inner chamber," which is the place of individual and distinctive responsibilities. In the outer chamber, a man is considered a "mere" citizen, an integer, a member of the electorate like anyone else. As he enters the inner chamber, his civic responsibilities and guilts become individ- ualized. The guilts of the inner chamber arise--if they arise at all-not from a status of mere citizenship but from the distinctive facts of his own personal biography.
