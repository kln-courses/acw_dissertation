<plain_text><page sequence="1">OF DOGON CROOKS AND THIEVES ALLEN F. ROBERTS tudy of Dogon crooks and thieves provides an opportunity to explore the profundity of data and concepts in the writings of Marcel Griaule and his colleagues, and to suggest questions and methods for future field research.' The crooks are intricately carved wooden ob- jects called yo domolo that are worn over the shoulder or carried by ritual thieves called Yona. I suggest that yo domolo shoulder crooks are plastic repre- sentations of a most critical moment in Dogon cosmogony: the "original sin" of defiance of God (Amma) in the theft of a piece of the sun to bring fire to earth, an act of disjunction and transformation that would bring about the creation of human culture. Yona reenact this event in their ritualized theft of property at the death of one of their number. Discussion of "constrained diversity" or "semantic equivalence" of the varied iconography of yo domolo crooks and of the social pur- poses of Yona as they enact their mythic charter and its underlying cosmological principles permits one to understand what these ideas are for in everyday life and how they work. Griaule wrote descriptively of ritual thieves in Masques dogons (1938a). In each clan there is a yo domolo shoulder crook, preserved by the clan elder and given to younger kinsmen to use. The elder, as guardian of the crook (Fig. 2), is called Yo, while the ones using the object are Yone or Yona; all these terms signify "thief." While the Yona in a village may occasionally get together to share a meal or to drink beer, their principal activity is at the death of another Yona. A suc- cessor is chosen immediately, and dur- ing the night following the death, he wanders through the village with the yo domolo of the deceased in one hand, while he slaughters any domestic ani- mals he may encounter with the other. No one may protest. This food is shared with other Yona, along with millet cakes prepared by the deceased's family and food stolen by other Yona (Griaule 1938a:332). Meanwhile, at the home of the de- ceased a goat is sacrificed the day of the death. A hole is made in the terrace roof above the room where the corpse is being prepared for burial, and a millet stalk is passed through the hole so that one end will rest on its chest. Blood from the goat is directed from the point of sacrifice on the roof, down the millet stalk to the body (Griaule 1938a: 332-35). As Griaule later wrote, "by this channel part of the life-force of the deceased family-head went back again into the robber's crook, which had been placed against the hole. The stick was then brought to the big family house near the altars of the ancestors, and became the property of the dead man's successor" (1965:194). The goat carcass is then thrown from the roof and collected by Yona gathered in the yard. They make a hole in the wall of the funeral room and remove the body through it; then they set out through the village, slaughtering animals they find. The skins from these are used to cover the corpse, while the Yona eat the meat. The son of the de- ceased sacrifices a second goat on the fresh adobe used to close the hole in the wall. Other funeral procedures, in- cluding masked dancing, are similar to those for other Dogon. Yona from nearby villages assemble, wearing their yo domolo over their shoulders.2 An elegy is pronounced, praising the man's ability to slaughter animals and provide for other Yona (Griaule 1938a:332-35). Griaule offers drawings and photo- graphs of a yo domolo shoulder crook, the fiber hood mask danced by young men to represent the Yona, a rock painting of a Yona from the great initiation shelter at Songo (Fig. 3), a wall painting from a shepherd's shelter at Bara showing a man dancing with a yo domolo in hand, granary bas-reliefs of yo domolo from Sanga and Soroli regions, and a boy's toy yo domolo made from a bent millet stalk (Griaule 1938a:519, 527, 562-64, pl. XX, 642, 685, 696; 1938b:45-47; also Lefevre 1972:146). Despite the breadth of these references to what one would assume to be an important set of practices, Griaule's associate Denise Paulme wrote in 1940 that "the institution of the Yona or ritual thieves remains very obscure" (pp. 290-91). In 1947 the sage Ogotemmeli provided Griaule with a conceptual context for the unusual behavior of the Yona, and for the iconography of the yo domolo.3 Ogotemmeli began what one can piece together as the story of the Yona with his well-known account of the descent of the celestial granary-ark "symbolizing the world system, set in place and classified into categories of creatures," measures, celestial bodies, and other beings, ob- jects, and phenomena (Griaule 1965:41- 42). When this "miraculous granary" was ready for descent to Earth, the an- cestor (explained by Ogotemmeli to be the "seventh Nommo and eldest of the eight sons of the first human pair") noted there was no fire for iron- smithing, and so slipped into the work- shop of the great Nommo, smith of God, and stole a piece of the sun. He seized live embers with a crook ending in an open mouth-like slit; this crook would be known thereafter as a yo domolo. The an- cestor dropped some of the embers, stopped to retrieve them, and was so 1. YO DOMOLO CROOK. WOOD, LEATHER THONG, 73cm. PRIVATE COLLECTION. 70</page><page sequence="2">agitated he could not find the entrance to the granary-ark. He climbed to the roof and hid the embers in one of the skins of his bellows while shouting "Guyo (Sto- len)!" The word is still used to mean "granary," and refers to the fact "that without the fire of the smithy and the iron of hoes there would be no crops to store" (Griaule 1965:42-43, 194). The ancestor then directed the granary-ark along the rainbow. The threads that were bound about the upper extremity of the granary unwound in coils "suggesting the movement of wa- ter" (prefiguring the zigzags of the yo domolo discussed below). The smith stood with his hammer and his bow in hand, ready to defend himself should he be attacked for having defied God through his theft of fire. At this time, the ancestor resembled a human except that he still possessed the flexible, serpentine members of a Nommo. Growing tired, he carried his heavy hammer cradled in his arms, his anvil in a sling low over his back. The velocity of the granary-ark in- creased and it crashed into the ground, scattering the beings and objects it car- ried to their present dispersion. The im- pact was such that the hammer and anvil broke the ancestor's arms and legs at what would be elbows and knees. "He thus acquired the joints proper to the new human form, which was to spread over the Earth and devote itself to toil." These articulations would be necessary for the work of human life. The ancestor climbed down from the granary-ark and set himself to dividing the field where he landed into eighty plots of eighty squares of a cubit per side, to be distrib- uted among the eight families descended from the ancestor. The smith set up shop to the north of these fields (Griaule 1965: 43-44). f Ilk lodr - = " .r.k , 2. YO "THIEF" WAGU SERU DOLO OF SANGA, WEARING HIS YO DOMOLO CROOK OVER HIS SHOULDER 1986. 3.

A being named Ogo wished to be the equal of Amma. Rather than waiting for Amma to create his double, as God had done for other primordial beings, Ogo impetuously seized a piece of his own placenta, against the wishes of God, to perform his own re-creation as a twin. This defiant act instead resulted in the interruption of the twinning process, and Ogo would remain forever weak and alone, with- out a twin. Ogo again attempted to steal his placenta. Amma had already trans- formed it into fire; Ogo could only take a small part of it, and burned his hand in doing so. Amma made the remaining placenta into the sun, while the bits Ogo stole this second time are the signs re- produced in the sand of Dogon divina- tion tables. Ogo was not allowed to leave Earth again and was metamorphosed into the Pale Fox (Vulpes pallidus), struck dumb by God as a punishment. The Pale Fox "speaks" only through divination, and the sand table is "the image of the Fox stealing the placenta of the sun" (Griaule &amp; Dieterlen 1965:195, 265, 274- 83). The name of the Pale Fox, Yurugu, is derived from or associated with the root yo, "to steal." On Earth, the Pale Fox be- came the "permanent element of disor- der - or rather of disorganization" in existence (Griaule &amp; Dieterlen 1965:265). The complex version of cosmogony presented in The Pale Fox includes an ark created to bring elements and beings to the Earth; its impact caused the ac- cidented landscape in which the Dogon live. The Nommo aboard transformed it- self into a horse to pull the ark to the marsh where it was hidden forever. The animal head ofyo domolo shoulder crooks is said to represent this horse that drew the ark. In a footnote that is frustrating for its brevity, Griaule and Dieterlen state that "in another perspective, the ac- tivity of the Yona and the symbolism of the yo domolo bring to mind the acts of the Pale Fox." Reference is made to the still-unpublished second volume of the Pale Fox series, meant to outline the events of the first sixty-six years of the ancestors' lives following the descent and impact of the ark (1965:369, 376, 440-46, 456-57). The yo domolo crook replicates the ob- ject used to steal a piece of the sun, to bring fire to human use. In The Pale Fox the zoomorphic head of this yo domolo is identified as that of the horse that pulled the ark (Griaule &amp; Dieterlen 1965:457). The horse-like yo domolo illustrated by Griaule (1938a:519) and Pauline (1940:292), however, are not the only sorts known. Indeed, there are slight variations on the "horse" type as well as what appear to be quite significant divergences. Here the concept of "constrained di- versity," as developed by Daniel Biebuyck with regard to Lega art, proves useful. As he has written, "The search for constrained diversity - that is, crea- tive originality - of forms underlies all Lega works... These astonishingly var- ied forms, all elaborated on one basic idea, fulfill identical social functions and reveal a common meaning" (1973:179). "Constrained diversity" or "semantic equivalence" (Horton in Layton 1981:g, 28-29) is revealed in the consideration of a number of objects called the same term and used the same way. Determining the reasons and rules for such diversity (and for such constraint, although these are far more difficult to pin down) requires field research during which questions can be put to those creating and using the objects. Probably the best Africanist example of the conscious search for the limits of such constraint is Dominique Zahan's Les antilopes du soleil (1980), a labor of love in which over five hundred chiwara figures are presented for com- parison.4 Even with a far smaller sample, however, important questions can be raised concerning what elements do constrain (that is, are necessary for the object to be a member of the category) and which may be allowed to vary ac- cording to cultural and historical factors or the creativity of particular artists. Ten yo domolo were included in this study.5 Most have an explicit zoomor- phic head and open mouth. Interpreta- tive identification of this head by infor- mants in Bamako and Sanga included "horse," with reference to the nobility of the ancestors who bequeathed this tradi- tion; "dog," as the protector of the household; "aardvark," because this animal "steals honey" (?), and "rabbit," which is "a great thief."6 Ogotemmbli of- fered yet another explanation to Griaule, saying that "the robber's crook.., is like a hyena, which eats the meat all raw and red. This meat recalls the stolen embers of the sun." Griaule adds that "crooks with red jaws are sometimes painted on the facades of sanctuaries to represent the burning and taking of bleeding meat by Yona thieves at the death of one of their number" (1965:194). Most yo domolo heads have hourglass shapes either cut out (Fig. 1) or incised (Fig. 4). Griaule and Dieterlen suggest that these refer to a horse's harness (1965:457). Again, informants' interpre- tations ranged from "open eyes, like those in masks,"7 to "windows through which to steal things, as Yona do." The number of these openings varies, like that of the zigzags of the "mane" that seem to continue their pattern. Infor- mants explained that this difference is 4. YO DOMOLO CROOK (TWO VIEWS). WOOD, IRON ORNAMENT SACRIFICIAL MATERIALS, 73cm. PRIVATE COLLECTION. 72</page><page sequence="4">because each family (ginna) will have particular motifs chosen according to its particular history. One suggested that the Binu priest assists in or determines the choice of a successor to a deceased Yona, and also decides what particular symbols will be carved in creating that individual's yo domolo.8 Each shoulder crook is different in iconography, the man continued, and Yona will know what is represented that reflects family history and the relative seniority of Yona among themselves. The most senior Yona will possess a yo domolo different from those of others.9 The zigzag patterns vary in other ways as well. Some of the triangles are divided in two along the top, from the base of the head down the length of the "mane," making two sets of parallel zigzags (Fig. 1). An informant associated the duality of the zigzags with the pairs of back-to- back human figures that are sometimes carved in the place of ears on the zoomorphic yo domolo heads (Fig. 2). These figures are not Nommo, I was told, but the pair of first human ances- tors (see Griaule 1965:194). The two fig- ures signify the duality of human rela- tions, just as the divided zigzags, the in- formant continued, represent the closely balanced relationship between the ser- pent Lebe (to whose sinuous course the zigzag motif alludes) and the hogan holy man whom Lebe protects. The ophidian reference was associated with theft by the Sanga village chief, since "snakes crawl about in such a way [the zigzag] as they steal from people." He added that the zigzags are also like the teeth of keys that a thief might use to enter a house to rob someone. On severalyo domolo, some of the zigzags are replaced by an- thropomorphic figures (Fig. 4), 10 whose angular features (pronounced chin, breasts, hands, knees, and feet) dupli- cate and refer to the zigzag motif. One informant stated that the bilateral sym- metry of one such figure, with breasts, hands, and legs clearly opposed along a medial line, like the division of the zig- zag triangles, represents the relationship of Lebe to hogon. In a number of other examples, a descending series of human or humanoid figures is found in place of the zigzags (Fig. 6)." In another, the zig- zags end in a human head, identified by informants as that of the hogon (Fig. 5). A zigzag motif is frequently used in rock paintings and forms of plastic ex- pression to represent the descent of the ark and the transmission of knowledge and power from the elemental act of theft of a piece of the sun. Griaule suggests that the zigzag yo domolo iconography re- flects this important event (1965:194; Griaule &amp; Dieterlen 1965:457; cf. Laude 1973:60). A similar theme of descent and transformation is represented by superimposed wooden figures that Jean Laude suggests "depict the descent of 5. YO DOMOLO CROOK. WOOD, 68cm. PRIVATE COLLECTION. the nommo with raised arms into the skull of... the head of the line of hogons." This may be "a reference to the quest for ataractic states" as "the nommo descends materially into the mind of the hogon to possess it concretely" (1973:text for figs. 24-25; cf. Ezra 1988:60-61). The yo domolo in Figures 4 and 5 appear to illustrate this same relationship and dynamic process of the transfer or acquisition of knowl- edge and power. Moreover, when one turns the yo domolo in Figure 4 to observe the human figure full face, one can speculate that the long, pointed ears of the zoomorphic head make a secondary reference to the upraised arms of so many well-known Dogon wooden figures. As Laude notes, this theme may be related to several mythical elements, including a Nommo lifting its arms to the heavens "for the rain of forgiveness" and the crucifixion of the Nommo sacrificed to purify the Earth after Ogo's desecration, its hands raised above its head (Laude 1973:text for figs. 8-25; cf. Ezra 1988:59). The complex- ity of the image is increased when the ears of the yo domolo are carved to repre- sent a matched pair of figures - either "ancestors," as an informant insisted, or ancestor/Nommo.12 Three yo domolo have heads quite dif- ferent from the others. One has a 6. YO DOMOLO CROOK. WOOD, 86.4cm. UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN MUSEUM OF ART GIFT OF DR. AND MRS. IRVING F BURTON. serpent-like face (Fig. 5) reminiscent of Dogon objects that, according to Jean Laude, reflect the relationship among serpents, Nommo, Lebe, and hogons (Laude 1973: figs. 4, 7, n.p.). The zigzag of this yo domolo joins the monstrous open-mouthed head with a human head, perhaps in sculptural representa- tion of the hogon's acquisition of sacred knowledge. This and another open- mouthed yo domolo with a more abstract face nevertheless possess the ears found on the other, horse-like, heads. The composite zoomorphic reference here is one of several similarities that yo domolo share with Bamana chiwara (including the laterality of the objects, meant to be viewed primarily from the side; see Zahan 1980: 12, 27).13 Other objects created by peoples of the region possess this same provocative juxtaposition of traits. The complexity of this multirefe- rential relationship is, presumably, among the "lexical" material that Yona adepts can "read" in each other's yo domolo. A final object (Fig. 7) identified as a yo domolo by informants deserves mention, 73</page><page sequence="5">as it stretches the limits of the semantic equivalence of this set of objects. Its simple rounded form has only two elab- orations: a typically arrow-shaped nose and a long, hatched-marked strip begin- ning just behind the nose and descend- ing to mid-handle. The strip is bisected by a hatch-marked ridge originating at the bridge of the nose. This yo domolo has no open mouth, ears, or any of the zig- zag motifs (except in the diamond- shaped crosshatching) of others: it must be at or close to the minimalist edge of the semantic set.14 Its human nose is a reference to the complex linking human, animal, and divine beings and princi- ples. So is the long strip along the back similar to the one on Figure 5 that sur- rounds the zigzags and runs from the monstrous head to that of the hogon. In- formants at Sanga said this represents a snake, as it crawls in to steal from people. All of these objects, despite their di- versity, are yo domolo. When informants state that the differences reflect the par- ticularities of family history and indi- vidual status, there is an implicit asser- tion of some totality of features from which artists are instructed or are free to choose the motifs they will carve. Yo domolo, therefore, are related to each other through metonymy: every object refers both to each other member of its set and to the set as a whole. To effect an outsider's understanding and overview of what yo domolo are (what they repre- sent, what they "do"), one must under- stand this important principle. The simplest yo domolo can still evoke the most complex set of images. This is ac- complished through implicit reference to others that are carved with different fea- tures that say something to Dogon in- itiated into circles of esoteric knowledge. The motifs ofyo domolo crooks are mul- tireferential, as are all symbols.15 The "ears" of the head, to cite but one exam- ple, may be obvious features of the zoomorphic head or they may be the sole reference to an animal head not carved in a particularyo domolo. They may be simple ears, or they may be further elaborated as a pair of anthropomorphic figures - primordial beings, whether ancestors or Nommo. When viewed from the back, they may be taken as part of an image set with a humanoid figure, and so provide a reference to the upstretched arms of other sacred carvings. Jean Laude's suggestion that Dogon "sculpture pro- duces ideas" and "meanings" (1973:26, 31) is important here, for those who read the iconography of an object like a yo domolo are not constrained to a single in- terpretation. As Griaule and Dieterlen suggest, Dogon have different "degrees of teaching," with an ultimate plateau of understanding reached in la parole claire (1965:52). Yet the early, less sophisti- cated or more superficial, levels of knowledge are not wrong; they are merely less profound than la parole claire. Presumably they may be more appropri- ate, useful, and adaptable to some cir- cumstances than the most arcane under- standings are. To investigate such a proposition, and to learn how, when, and for whom "sculpture produces ideas," focused fieldwork will be neces- sary. The social uses of yo domolo can be re- considered in the light of these matters, to attempt an answer to the complex question of how one moves from cos- mology (theft of a piece of the sun) to lives as lived (Yona ritual thieves). The original sin of the ancestor's or Ogo's theft is an act of defiance that creates a distinction between divinity and what will become human existence. The abil- ity to define and distinguish elements of the universe as it is known to the nar- rators of such tales is established in the story. Until there is discontinuity, one cannot know one thing to be different from another. Biological, botanical, as- tronomical, and other classification sys- tems are articulated in the "miraculous granary" or ark. 16 The ark existed before the act of defiance, yet required the an- cestor's theft to be realized and ac- tualized. As the ancestor cries "Guyo (Stolen)!" disjunction is established between God and humans, heaven and Earth, and among the various classifications of be- ings, objects, and phenomena that will be scattered upon the ark's impact to constitute the world as known. "Dis- junction" is a key word here, as under- scored in the story itself when the ances- tor's serpentine limbs are broken at the points of articulation necessary for human work. Divine continuity is bro- ken, human culture born. Using the human energy of bent arms and legs, the ancestor sets to the further articulation of physical space by creating the cubit- square plots of cultivated land (which, as Ogotemmeli indicated, refer to the "warp and woof" of God's Word, and to more mundane processes such as weav- ing; Griaule 1965). The ambivalence that Dogon feel con- cerning their separation from God is demonstrated in Ogotemmeli's account and in the version featuring Ogo and the Pale Fox. Theft is separation, disjunc- tion, articulation, opposition; it is also the violence that characterizes any change. Human relations, even among those most closely related, are never simple and straightforward. Rather, they are marked by oppositions between overt generosity and hidden greed, philanthropy and personal ambition. Life is rarely if ever as it appears. The thief of Dogon cosmology, especially as represented in Ogo and the Pale Fox, is the incarnation of such a conundrum. Mary Douglas has pursued this line of reasoning. Ogo is burned and maimed in attempting a second theft of his placenta, and after his metamorphosis into the Pale Fox, he can only speak through the tracks left in the sand patterns of the di- vination table. As Douglas asserts, "Any culture which admits the use of oracles and divination is committed to a distinc- tion between appearances and reality." Divination allows one to reach "behind appearances to another source of knowl- edge" and "aims at freedom from the formal conditions of knowledge." Doug- las sees an "extraordinary sympathy be- tween the Dogon and the surrealists" in the respect both show for "the unfet- tered imagination" through which "art must be made free to produce itself" (1975a,b: 127-30). The Pale Fox acts outside control, out- side appearances and realist validity. Paradoxically, by so doing, the Fox dialectically reconfirms the existence and necessity of the very control he defies. 17 He is a mediating trickster,whose opera- tion in the realm of antistructure reveals the truth of human life through didactic tales, mnemonic plastic references, dramatizations in ritual, and divination. As Griaule and Dieterlen state in their tantalizingly brief footnote, the Fox and Yona adepts "bring each other to mind" (1965:457). If the Fox represents a chal- lenge to appearances by being so bold as to defy and stand away from them, theft by Yona members is a glimpse into a lim- inal "realm of pure possibility whence novel configurations of ideas and rela- tions may arise" and "where there is a certain freedom to juggle with the factors of existence" (Turner 1970:97, 106). Still, one can ask what these ideas and practices are for. Surely the Dogon are not all theologians, even if one can argue that in the last months of his long life, Ogotemmeli enjoyed ideas for their own sake (see Clifford 1983:124-25). Surely the Dogon have not produced yo domolo for the glories of contemplation alone. Rather, Jean Laude was correct when he wrote that Dogon "sculpture produces meanings" (1973:31), and these are or be- come meanings only in the context of lived life. As Victor Turner asserted in a complementary mode, "Symbols... produce action" (1970:22); to understand the meaning of sculptural symbolism, one must refer directly to the particular social context in which it is used. Yona dance at the death of one of their number. Then their thefts signify sep- aration of the loved one from their midst and the inevitable losses one must suffer as life goes on. Disjunction implies both an end and a beginning, however, and the deceased is transformed at death, just as his survivors are in his absence. The unusual funeral practice for Yona (also undertaken at the death of Binu priests), in which blood from a sacrifice on the house roof of the deceased is con- 74</page><page sequence="6">ducted down a millet stalk to the corpse's chest, recapitulates the essential ele- ments of primordial disjunction. As Dominique Zahan suggests, the roof ter- race represents the sky in a divine/ human, heaven/Earth, up/down set of oppositions (Zahan 1969:82, 130-31). The flow of blood, then, reproduces the zig- zag descent of the ark and the imparting of vitality and knowledge that this im- plies, even as it is a play on death as dis- junction from one state and the begin- ning of another. But what of other Yona activities, or other contexts in which there is reference to the original theft of a piece of the sun? Ogotemmeli, commenting on the fun- eral practices observed at the death of a Yona thief, noted that "when anyone be- comes a family-head, he receives, among other things, a portion of the life-force derived from the robber's crook near the altars. This crook recalls the one with which the celestial fire was stolen; but that which is of greatest worth is, ul- timately, the smith himself, whom the crook represents" (in Griaule 1970:194). A piece of the sun was stolen to obtain fire for humankind. The Dogon smith is the direct heir of this event, through the ancestor as his avatar. The fire of a smith's forge allows cultural transforma- tion of iron to tool. The two spherical clay pots of the smith's bellows "symbolize the sun," and the tuyere conducts the "breath of the sun" to build the fires put to human use in the forge. The smith's blows ring with a reference to the des- cent of the ark after the theft of a piece of the sun. He intervenes in cases of human conflict, separating the disputants with a blow of his hammer to rocks, "thus bringing a divine note into the human disorder and calming the passions aroused" (Griaule 1965: 86-87). Another method of suppressing theft exists, in which Yona restore order in a manner similar to the way Dogon smiths may Men wearing red-fiber hood masks representing Yona (Griaule 1938a:521-23, 562)18 chase women and children from fruit-bearing sa trees and destroy any baskets of stolen fruit they may find. "In case of a grave dispute between two vil- lages, men wearing these masks can separate the combatants. All disorder is prohibited in the presence of the masks" (Griaule 1938a:522, 767), even as the masks themselves represent disorder through reference to the original thief and the Pale Fox. The ideas and objects of the Yona, then, do serve a set of practical purposes. Unfortunately, there are no particular cases of such use recorded in the litera- ture to date, and so we have no sense of the dynamics of local-level politics as people play out their lives using ideas, objects, and practices such as these as vehicles for thought and action. One can prepare a set of research questions from the sort of discussion and framing of ex- tant data presented here, however. Yona practices and related objects are changing. Informants at Sanga, when shown the photographs in Griaule's Masques dogons, said that the fiber hood masks representing Yona are no longer made and danced there. The chief of Sanga remarked that young people know some of the related dances but not necessarily their significance. In a dis- cussion with a staff member from the Musee National du Mali, he urged that young people be taught these elements of their heritage. While this is a laudable goal, it is also true that Dogon society, like any society, has always been in a state of flux. If some practices are no longer followed (or perhaps never were by all segments of the society), the rea- sons include a lack of further need to per- form them. Yona do still exist, however. The chief estimated there are fifteen in Sanga, and he knows of others in nearby villages such as Kundu. It would seem that this custom continues because Dogon need a means to contemplate dis- junction from realist validity. Such a hypothesis deserves further elaboration through the existing data of the Griaule school and through field research. The paradox of the Yona ritual thieves and of the emblematic yo domolo crooks and red-fiber masks is that they are a necessary hinge - the personification and realization of the concept of disjunc- tion critical to Dogon logic. They seem a negative force: Yona theft flies in the face of ordinary cooperation, solidarity, and respect for person and property. Yona, like the Pale Fox, challenge appearances, rules, and values. Through participation in or observation of Yona, people avail themselves "of the opportunity of a puz- zlement" (Fernandez 1980:48) and con- sider the creative, innovative excitement of "pure possibility" (Turner 1970:106). Yet the very challenge of the thieves pro- vides the foil necessary to recognize what is "realist validity" in everyday life, what is ordinary and commonsense. Or- der, then, is paradoxically established and confirmed in its own subversion through Yona theft. This, in part at least, must explain how ritual thieves can have some role in preventing or rectifying pro- fane theft and other disruption in the community. The primordial theft of a piece of the sun is the first act of defiance necessary to separate Earth from the heavens and God from humanity; it leads to creation of classification, articulation of knowl- edge, and establishment of human cul- ture. The theft is punished in "the fall." Yet those who tell such stories, like those who dramatize them in Yona ritual, do so to help themselves understand the contradictions, inconsistencies, and con- tingent truths of their lives as lived. Ideas and the art that expresses them serve practical as well as aesthetic purposes, and research methods must be de- veloped that are broad and sophisticated enough to capture the dynamic tension this implies.

PRIVATE COLLECTION. 75</page><page sequence="7">ROBERTS, notes, from page 75 Research for this article was conducted during the summer of 1986 when Mary Kujawskiand I joined a brief mission to Sanga and surrounding Dogon villages sponsored by the Mus6e Nationale du Mali (MNM). Thanks are extended to the former director of MNM, Dr. Claude Ardouin, and to Oumar Traore and Cheik Traore of his staff for their kind assistance and generous friendship; and to Chief Djangunoa Dolo, Yona society member Wagu Seru Dolo, Dagi Gero, Seru Kudjugo, and other Sanga inhabitants for answering so many questions with such patience and good cheer. Our participation in the MNM mission was made possible through the African National Museums Program at the University of Michigan, with funding from the University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) and a Hewlett-Mellon Foundation Faculty Development Grant at Albion College. Thanks toDr. Evan Maurer, director of UMMA, and to Dr. Catherine Lamb, associate provost at Albion, for their special help. A preliminary version of this paper was presented at a panel of the Arts Council of the African Studies Associa- tion annual meeting in Madison (1986). Marianne Smith, a former student in the Graduate Museum Practice Program of UMMA, helped assemble and think through much of the literature discussed here. Finally, thanks to professors Luc de Heusch, Dominique Zahan, and Philippe Jespers for fruitful conversations in Brussels, fall 1986, as this paper was being prepared, to Kate Ezra for sharing results of her research and CONTRIBUTORS R.M.A. BEDAUX is a scientific officer at the Instituut voor Antropobiologie, Rijksuniversiteit Utrecht.

Despite the generosity of all these individuals and agencies, responsibility for the present work remains my own. For Ma'du. 1. Because of space constraints, the version of my paper published here lacks the theoretical framework necessary to understand why the Griaule literature is often dismissed by American and British scholars, and how an approach that seeks to "reveal, by contradiction and inconsistency, the practical socialuses towhich theirDogoncosmologicalschemes areput" (Douglas 1975:139) allows one to identify the "contingent truth" of particular narrations of stories and interpretations of art. See Clifford 1983. 2. Seru Kudjugo of Sanga, whose family has included Yona membership, told of how late one night several years ago, ten old men came to his compound to sleep. They were Yona on their way to a funeral of a Yona in Ireli village. Knowing that Seru was of the direct family of a Yona, they paid him this visit. They said nothing to him, though, and slept stretched on the ground, the yo domolo crooks grasped in their right hands, round dede cowhide shields in their left. He gave them kola nuts and said he was honored that they had come. 3. See Clifford 1983 for a useful discussion of the transforma- tion of Griaule's understanding and perspective resulting from these conversations. 4. Zahan asserts that "there do not exist two tyiwara crests that are absolutely identical ... due to the fact that the object is a sort of plastic template (schema) representing the message that the artist wished to transmit. ... To rediscover the totality of the thought of the author and, consequently, the overall significance of the object, it is necessary to constitute series of artefacta of the same sort, ranging from unfinished pieces to the most accomplished forms .... This is to say that objects of the same sort only reveal their true significance when they confront one another, each 'saying' more than or less than their im- mediate neighbors" (Zahan 1980:12). For an application of these ideas, see Roberts &amp; Maurer 1986:219-78. 5. Two yo domolo are in the permanent collection of the University of Michigan Museum of Art (Fig. 6), four more (Figs. 1, 4, 5, 8) are in a private collection in Ann Arbor, and four (Fig. 2) were seen and handled in Sanga, Mali. Photos of the first six were taken to Mali to discuss with the informants who possessed the last four yo domolo mentioned above. I viewed two more yo domolo in dealers' collections in Bamako and another in the Katherine White Reswick Collection, now at the Cleveland Museum of Art (see the much-cited, albeit conjectural description in Fagg 1%9: no. 4); other yodomolo are discussed in Pern 1982:58-59, Celenko 1983: no. 5; Zwernemann 1973:77; Bedeux 1977: no. 48.5; Traditional African Sculpture from the Britt Family Collection, 1982: no. 11; Les Tellems et les Dogons, 1973:1, no. C154; and Fine African and Oceanic Art, 1980: no. 104. 6. All the problems associated with a brief field visit are acknowledged here: Icertainly do not presume to have gotten to "know" the Dogon or their art in a few days. The ac- complishment of Griaule and his associates is such that even with very limited time, one can "hit the ground running" through reference to the literature they have established. At the same time, this literature cannot be taken at face value, as mentioned in note 1. 7. This might be compared to Griaule and Dieterlen's ex- planation of an hourglass-shaped rupestrian painting as representing "the eyes of Amma," or God, whichreferin turn to the totality of Amma and his double placenta, hence the establishment of basic duality, and to the beginning of the spiral expansion of the universe, as detailed in other paintings and contexts (1965:101, 103, 130-31). 8. This assertion was disputed by another informant, and time was insufficient to pursue the matter. Ogotemmnli explained the association between Binu shrines and Yona themes and activities, and between Binu and smithies. The Binu sanctuary "is" a smithy, according to Ogotemmeli, and the paintings ofyo domolo on the facade recall the theft of a piece of the sun by the first smith/ancestor/Ogo, to bring fire to the eventual use of humankind (Griaule 1965:102,110). Ordinary domolo shoulder- crook throwing-sticks are both painted on the Binu shrine wall and hung over the top of the wall. These "symbolize the sons every family wants" and refer to fertility, nurturing, and hunting (Griaule 1965:110). Through metonymy of form alone, these unelaborated shoulder crooks must be related to yo domolo; use of ordinary domolo reinforces this assertion. 9. Social relations among Yona, including what it means to be a "senior" adept, remain to be studied in the field. 10. Choice of the verb "are" reflects a theory of semantic equivalence rather than a proposition of one theme as archetypal or "classic." See Laude 1973:23. 11. The handles of other objects are elaborated in a similar way. See the blacksmith's ritual adze illustrated in Ezra 1988:95. 12. Confirmation of these speculative assertions should be sought through field research. Kate Ezra warns that she has found no field-collected data supporting Laude's interpreta- tions to which reference is made here (1988:61). Nevertheless, this line of thinking is consistent with the logic of Dogon cosmology concerning the descent of the ark, and-one would assume-other contemporary, everyday purposes such narra- tives serve in explaining the acquisition of knowledge and power by critical cultural figures like hogons and smiths. See also Zahan's discussion of the way a wide range of forked objects may form a metonymic conceptual set and so be substituted, one for another, in certain Dogon rituals (1%9:133-36, figs. 10, 11, esp. fig. 11C). 13. Another point in common may be the way that during chiwara dances a "hyena" steals from the audience and in the village, imitating "death that robs us all" (Zahan 1980:30). Zahan asserts that a fruitful comparative study could be under- taken of Dogon Yona and Bamana chiwara institutions, based on ethnographic data he has not yet presented in his many writings (pers. comm., 1986). 14. Informants at Sanga were shown a photo of this object, and identified it as (or at least agreed it was) a yo domolo. Never- theless, it may be that it is not one, but a far more common domolo throwing stick such as those Dogon use in many practical and ritual contexts. One might still suggest a metonymic relationship to exist among various sorts of domolo, as mentioned in note 8; this is a question for field research. 15. See, for instance, Victor Turner's "Symbols in Ndembu Ritual" (1970:19-47) for a useful discussion of the multi- referential nature (and other qualities) of symbols. 16. One may recall a statement by Durkheim and Mauss cited by Zahan (1%9:title page), that "every mythology is, at base, a classification." 17. For an elaboration of this point, see Mary Douglas's "Jokes" (1975: 90-114). The joke's "excitementlies in thesuggestion that any particular ordering of experience may be arbitrary and subjective" (Douglas 1975:95-%). Yet to recognize subversion is to recognize that pattern, no matter how arbitrary, exists to be subverted (cf. Turner 1970:105). 18. The ethnographic present here is the 1930s when Griaule was writing. Zahan (1%9) provides adetailed discussion of the red fibers and masks made from them, including figurative associations with the sun and Ogo's theft of part of it.</page></plain_text>
