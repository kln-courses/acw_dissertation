<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 6 Dynamic Figures of Mirarr Country:  Chaloupka’s four-phase theory and the  question of variability within a rock  art style Iain G. Johnston, Joakim Goldhahn and Sally K. May Introduction This chapter highlights the concept of ‘style’ within rock art research in relation to Dynamic  Figure rock art found in western Arnhem Land, Australia (Figure 6.1). Our aim is to reassess  George Chaloupka’s four-phase chronology for this art style. The data for this revision are 155  Dynamic Figure paintings, documented through our ongoing fieldwork in Mirarr Country as  part of the Mirarr Gunwarddebim (Rock Art) Project.

His work spanned decades, and his publications,  particularly Journey in Time (Chaloupka 1993a), helped to promote the importance of this body  of art, both within Australia and internationally, arguing that it is the world’s longest continuing  art tradition. Chaloupka considered Dynamic Figures to be ‘the most vital and exciting paintings  of the region’s long art sequence’ (Chaloupka 1993a:106). While in this chapter we critique his  work, we do so with the utmost respect for his pioneering achievements. Chaloupka took his investigations of Dynamic Figures one step further than any other rock  art style he wrote about. He attempted to develop an internal chronology within the Dynamic  Figure style, following his observation that ‘at first [Dynamic Figures] seem to be a homogenous  body of art, but several well defined subgroups can be identified’ (Chaloupka 1993a:106). In this  chapter, we focus on Chaloupka’s attempt to define chronological subgroups among Dynamic  Figures, a difficult but crucial undertaking that identified significant attributes of the style and  facilitated similar future studies. We explore the theories motivating such a process and, based on  our analysis of Mirarr rock art, we discuss newly identified problems with Chaloupka’s proposal. The results of our analysis show few correlations between Mirarr Country Dynamic Figures and  Chaloupka’s four-phase chronology. We present evidence for a lack of distinct differences between  his phases, for example by showing that a large percentage of images and scenes within the overall  assemblage bear traits that belong to more than one phase. Our work suggests that variability  within Dynamic Figure art is more representative of motivations unrelated to chronology, and  we argue that such variability should thus be interpreted in other ways.  Style and chronology in Arnhem Land rock art research The concept of ‘style’ was introduced to rock art research as a typological tool during the early  20th century (Francis 2001). In many ways, this was a result of increased and more systematic  fieldwork that demonstrated the immense variation of rock art traditions in different parts of the  world. At first, the concept of ‘style’ was used to distinguish particular rock art traditions from  each other, such as Palaeolithic versus post-Palaeolithic rock art in southern Europe (e.g. Breuil  1920), or differences between ‘hunter-gatherer’ and ‘farmer’ rock art in northern Europe  (e.g. Almgren 1927, 1934; Gjessing 1936, 1939). Soon after, the notion of style came to be used  to construct chronological phases within specific rock art traditions (e.g. Althin 1945; Anati  1976; Breuil 1952, 1955–1975; Gjessing 1936; Glob 1969; Hallström 1938; Leroi-Gourhan  1967; Marstrander 1963). In this context, ‘style’ came to be used as the kind of analytical tool  that is still prominent today (Francis 2001; Sanz and Fiore 2014). Even though the concept of ‘style’ has been widely debated within archaeology, material culture  studies and social anthropology (e.g. Carr and Neitzel 1995; Conkey and Hastorf 1990; Hodder  1982; Layton 1991), most rock art researchers have been reasonably conservative in their efforts  to challenge the concept (Francis 2001). We also find some general differences in how the notion  of ‘style’ has been formulated by rock art researchers belonging to different schools of thought.  In traditional culture-historical approaches to archaeology (Trigger 1989), stylistic change within  a corpus of rock art was generally treated as indicative of chronological change (e.g. Breuil 1952;  Hallström 1938), an approach that continues to linger in some rock art research. Changes in  thinking since the 1960s in particular have led to a number of new approaches. For example,  Conkey (e.g. Conkey and Hastorf 1990) argued that ‘style’ should not be seen as indicating  peoples, chronological phases or the like, but rather as a context of doing things. In the late 1970s  and early 1980s, a strong intellectual movement away from treating style from an etic perspective  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="3"> 6.  Dynamic Figures of Mirarr Country    111  as passive adaption to environmental conditions (e.g. Binford 1972) saw the emergence of style  as active, emic social engagements. In these latter formulations, the notion of style came to  feature in more conscious social and ideological uses of material culture through the notion of  ‘symbols in action’ (e.g. Hodder 1982). The latter has often been discussed in relation to theories  of information exchange, with deep roots in various forms of structuralism (e.g. Wobst 1977; see  also Clegg 1977; Conkey 2001; Leroi-Gourhan 1967; Lewis-Williams 2002; McDonald 2008;  Nordbladh 1978; Smith 1989; Taylor 1996; Tilley 1991).  From an etic, formalistic perspective, there are several reasons to rethink the ‘style’ concept in  rock art research. When direct accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) radiocarbon dating of  rock art was introduced in the 1980s, researchers rapidly showed that what had been thought  of as established rock art chronologies born of stylistic criteria now had to be reconsidered  (e.g. Lorblanchet and Bahn 1993). While there were some agreements between the established  chronologies and the new absolute dates, there were also numerous differences. One possible  reason for such inaccuracies is that already-present images influence the creation of new art,  a phenomenon that is evident in both past and contemporary artworks in western Arnhem Land  (see May 2008; Taylor 1996).  Moreover, Chippindale and Taçon (1993) have shown that sometimes it is only a fraction of  the rock art images of a given region that fall within proposed stylistic criteria. In their work  at Mt Brockman and Twin Falls in western Arnhem Land, only 35 per cent and 18 per cent,  respectively, of the rock art figures could be placed within existing chronological frameworks,  leaving the majority of the art undefined and unaccounted for (Chippindale and Taçon 1993:38,  48–56, Tables 1 and 2). This led them to abandon the use of the term ‘style’ when describing  rock art, using the expression ‘manner of depiction’ instead (Chippindale and Taçon 1993:36). There are also reasons to challenge the ‘style’ concept from an exclusively emic perspective.  Studies of material culture within anthropology have listed more than 150 reasons why stylistic  differentiation will appear (Roe 1995; see also Layton 1991); chronology is only one of these  reasons. In this context, the recent history of making rock art in western Arnhem Land is  instructive. Here, particular stylistic traits are shown to be the result of specific individuals or  artistic groups working closely together (e.g. Taylor 1996). A telling example is the life, work  and legacy of Najombolmi, a Narwagite man born around 1895 within what is today Kakadu  National Park. Najombolmi is often recognised as one of the last great rock artists of western  Arnhem Land (Chaloupka 1993a; Haskovec and Sullivan 1989; Taçon and Chippindale 2001b).  There are more than 600 rock paintings attributed to him. These paintings are found over an  area of 1800 km2, stretching over the territories of several languages groups, including at least six  recognised clans (Haskovec and Sullivan 1989:62). Seen from an etic, Eurocentric perspective,  the distinctive individual style of Najombomi’s artworks, characterised as ‘decorative X-ray’ by  Chaloupka (1993a), could easily have been classified as its own art style or sub-style within  a larger corpus of rock art (cf. Taçon 1987, 1989). This raises questions not only about what the  notion of ‘style’ represents per se, but also how it is defined and used in rock art research more  generally. Despite these concerns, ‘style’ is still used as a basic concept when creating rock art chronologies.  One reason for this can be found in the widely recognised problem of dating rock art.  Notwithstanding advances in dating techniques, many, if not most, rock art chronologies still  continue to be built following a stylistic logic first formulated and introduced in rock art research  in the early 20th century (Francis 2001), albeit with new theoretical perspectives (e.g. Sanz  2012; Sanz and Fiore 2014; Smith 2008). Rock art chronologies of western Arnhem Land are no  exception to this trend.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="4"> 112    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia The manifold artistic assemblage of western Arnhem Land rock art is indeed overwhelming. Based  on its diversity and density, researchers have been able to distinguish at least 11 overarching rock  art styles by which to create rock art sequences and chronologies (e.g. Brandl 1982; Chaloupka  1984b, 1993a, 1993b; Chippindale and Taçon 1998; Lewis 1988; Taçon and Chippindale 1994).  Many of these chronologies have been developed from sequences created at key sites and then tested,  to various degrees, more widely across the region (e.g. Chaloupka 1977; Chippindale and Taçon  1993; Haskovec 1992). Chaloupka’s chronological model was mainly based on superimpositions  observed in the rock art of Mt Gilruth and extended via data obtained from his more widespread  surveys, the most detailed of which came from Deaf Adder Gorge and Mt Brockman (Chaloupka  1977, 1984a, 1984b). His observed patterns of superimposition among specific rock art faunal  motifs were later related to what environmental researchers had identified as regional environmental  changes (Chaloupka 1984a, 1993a, 1993b). His resulting chronology consists of three environmental  periods, Pre-Estuarine, Estuarine and Freshwater, followed by so-called Contact rock art. The Pre- Estuarine period, which is the main focus of this article, consists of seven styles, which from oldest  to most recent read in the following chronological order: Object Prints, Large Naturalistic Figures  Complex, Dynamic Figures, Post-Dynamic Figures, Simple Figures with Boomerangs, Mountford  Figures and Yam Figures (Chaloupka 1993a:89).  In contrast, Lewis’s (1988) chronology is largely constructed from observations of technological  changes in depicted material culture, principally spearthrowers, but other material culture  associated with different styles and regions were considered as well. Even though some differences  are noticeable between Chaloupka’s and Lewis’s chronological models, their main sequences both  hold Dynamic Figures in a similar position as the first substantial group of depicted human  figures with distinct items of material culture (May et al. 2017). Definition, distribution and chronology Brandl (1982:169, 172–173) was the first researcher to identify Dynamic Figures, which he  described as ‘early’ Mimi art, as a specific, chronologically meaningful rock art style for western  Arnhem Land. Various, more detailed definitions of the style now exist, including Chaloupka’s  (1984b:8) detailed report on Dynamic Figures:  This style consists of small drawings of human figures, anthropomorphs, animals and composite  beings, predominately portrayed in animated action. In the depictions of running figures with their  wide spread legs, the artist of this style translated the intensity of physical motion into pictorial  dynamics. Chaloupka (1984b:4) understood the notion of ‘style’ to be both an objective and subjective tool  in rock art research:  In my study of the Arnhem Land Plateau rock art I have considered the paintings in a broader  perspective, and used style – art’s objective, descriptive aspects of constant form and elements, and  the subjective, evaluative aspects of qualities and expressions, as the most important factors in its  analysis. It is by identifying individual styles and by arranging them in chronological sequence  that a meaningful division in a body of art can be achieved, and it is only then that other forms of  analysis can be used. It follows that Chaloupka viewed the concept of style from an etic perspective, and first and  foremost as a chronological tool within rock art research, something that we will try to reconsider  through our case study from Mirarr Country. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="5"> 6.  Dynamic Figures of Mirarr Country    113  The current known distribution of Dynamic Figure art falls within an area that measures north– south about 180 km in length and east–west 200 km in width, stretching from the Cadell and  Mann rivers in the east to the outliers of the Arnhem Land escarpment to the west, and from  the Wellington Ranges in the north to Birdie Creek in the south (Chaloupka 1984b, 1993;  Chippindale et al. 2000:66, Figure 1; cf. Gunn and Whear 2007; May et al. 2017).  Dynamic Figures have received more attention than any other style, arguably because of their  regional distribution, complexity and quality of depiction and their apparently key role for  understanding how the rock art of western Arnhem Land has changed over time (Chaloupka  1984b, 1988, 1993a, 1993b; Chippindale et al. 2000; Gunn and Whear 2007; Haskovec 1992;  Lewis 1997; Taçon and Chippindale 2001a). At the moment, no direct dating exists for the  earliest styles of rock art in western Arnhem Land. That said, researchers broadly agree on the  relatively early position of Dynamic Figures in western Arnhem Land rock art sequences (Brandl  1982; Chaloupka 1977, 1984b, 1993a; Chippindale and Taçon 1993, 1998; Haskovec 1992;  Lewis 1988; Taçon and Chippindale 1994). These chronologies propose that Dynamic Figures  form the first substantial collection of depicted humanoid figures to feature in recognised rock art  styles, and contain the first explicit scenes, providing unparalleled opportunities to understand  aspects of the cultures that produced them. Chaloupka is the only researcher who has established an internal sequence for Dynamic Figures,  a chronology based on variations in the ways anthropomorphs were depicted and for which he  proposed four distinct temporal phases (Chaloupka 1993a:106). These phases are defined in relation  to how they vary from the second phase, which he named Classical Dynamic Figures (Figure 6.2): The first representations of this style are considered larger than the following, classical dynamics  when the figures attained the maximum of visual movement. In a third phase the bodies of the  male figures became stockier, their arms lost their musculature and became one-line thick as did the  associated boomerangs. That the stylistic variation was also expressed for some time is suggested by  differentially weathered superimpositions. The final figures in this phase are fully composed of dots  (Chaloupka 1993b:93). Chaloupka’s suggested chronology was built on stylistic differences within the corpus of Dynamic  Figures. His analysis takes in evidence from at least 250 sites (Chaloupka 1984b:8), although he  notes knowing of 350 sites (Chaloupka 1993a:106, 1993b:92–95). Even though his general rock  art chronology from western Arnhem Land has been, to some extent, reviewed and revised by  subsequent researchers (e.g. Chippindale and Taçon 1993, 1998; Haskovec 1992; Lewis 1988;  Taçon and Chippindale 1994), so far Chaloupka’s four-phase chronology for Dynamic Figures  has not been subject to any critical assessment.  Chaloupka did not provide specific examples and descriptions of each of his four phases. As a  result, his classification and identification is to some degree problematic. However, based on  his published and unpublished reports, we have ascertained the key aspects of classification for  Chaloupka’s Dynamic Figure phases (Figure 6.2). In summary, Phase 1 images are described as the largest Dynamic Figures, with similarities to the  Phase 2 ‘Classical Dynamic Figures’. Classical Dynamic Figures are described as expressing the  most exaggerated ‘movement’ among all Dynamic Figures; these figures are smaller than those  of Phase 1. In Phase 3, the depiction of male bodies becomes ‘stockier’, with arms and legs now  expressed as single lines and losing musculature and definition in the process. Finally, Phase 4 are  ‘pointillistic’ figures, with small dots being applied to form an image. This includes dots around  the body, and in some cases dots replace solid brush strokes (Chaloupka 1993a:106, 1993b:93;  see Figure 6.2). ‘Pointillistic’ Dynamic Figures are distinctly different from some Dynamic  Figures that are depicted with dots around them or emanating from their mouths to indicate  intangible aspects of a scene (see Chippindale et al. 2000). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="6"> 114    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Figure 6.2 Examples of Chaloupka’s four phases of Dynamic Figures from Jabiluka, from left to right  representing the oldest to youngest phases.

Source: Iain Johnston. The distinction between Phases 1 and 2 is the most problematic, as Chaloupka does not give  actual  measurements or size parameters for Dynamic Figures associated with each phase.  However,  as he recorded some sites from the same region as our study area, we were able to  re-record  these same figures and determine his method of measuring Dynamic Figures.  The criteria for determining whether a Dynamic Figure belongs to Phase 3 or Phase 4 are easier to  follow, as the determining single-line arm depiction versus dot construction are simple presence/ absence criteria (Figure 6.2).  Another problem with Chaloupka’s four-phase chronology is that he does not provide a great  deal of evidence for the suggested temporality of Dynamic Figures. In his 1984b report, the  most detailed analysis of western Arnhem Land’s Dynamic Figures that Chaloupka completed,  he mentions 28 sites that show temporal evidence. For example, he notes nine examples of  superimposition among Dynamic Figures. Four of these sites (Sites 83, 144, 179, 188) each have  larger figures over smaller figures; a further four sites (Sites 13, 192, 233, 234) are simply discussed  as having unspecified superimpositions. It is hardly convincing as evidence for a reliable four- phase chronological sequence if many examples exist that contradict the claimed or hypothesised  chronology. That said, Site 113 has superimpositions consistent with Phase 2 following Phase 3,  although Chaloupka (1984b) does not describe the superimposition in as much detail as he does  with other Dynamic Figure sites.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="7"> 6.  Dynamic Figures of Mirarr Country    115  There are other examples of inconsistencies  in his chronological framework – a painting  at Site 124 (Figure 6.3) is described as a later  Dynamic Figure but it has no example of  dotting; according to our understanding,  these particular Dynamic Figures are more  consistent with his Phase 1 or Phase 2.  Figure 6.3 Dynamic Figure from Chaloupka’s Our overall impression of Chaloupka’s  Site 124, described as a later Dynamic Figure presented  evidence is that there are some  but not showing any evidence of dotting and contradictions in his suggested Dynamic Figure  with characteristics more consistent with his chronology, which means that the chronology  earlier phases. is itself problematic.

Research area Our team conducted a systematic survey of the Jabiluka Leasehold area (henceforth, Jabiluka)  within Mirarr Country between 2012 and 2014. The area is bordered on all sides by the World  Heritage–listed Kakadu National Park. Within Jabiluka, the Dynamic Figures recorded for this  research come from the Djawumbu-Madjawarrnja complex, which is the largest rock formation  within Jabiluka, at approximately 5 × 2.7 km in area (including outlying rock formations)  (Figure 6.4). As of 2014, we recorded a total of 528 rock art sites within Jabiluka. Ethnographic  sources suggest that the Djawumbu-Madjawarna complex was a significant area for cultural  activities for several clan/language groups during ethnographic times, including Mirarr, Dadjbaku  and Bunidj (Chaloupka 1978; Kamminga and Allen 1973; Layton 1981, cited in Wright et al.  2014). This and further information on the ethnographic evidence for occupation of the Jabiluka  area are discussed elsewhere (see Chapters 3 and 5). Figure 6.4 Map of the Djawumbu-Madjawarna Massif. The vast majority of Dynamic Figures analysed were recorded on the eastern and southern rock formations. The Mirarr people  have requested that the exact location of sites are not shown.

This area includes unknown numbers of sites with Dynamic Figure  animal images, hand stencils of the three middle finger type (3MF) and object stencil sites, which  Chaloupka (1993a:106, 1993b) argues were largely contemporaneous with Dynamic Figures  (see also Lewis 1988:56–57). Our own survey area consists of a significantly smaller area measuring  approximately 5 × 2.7 km, within which 117 sites with Dynamic Figures, boomerang stencils  or 3MF stencils have been recorded. Leaving aside other, possibly contemporaneous art such  as boomerang stencils, our team recorded 33 sites with 155 Dynamic Figure anthropomorphs,  some with eight to 10 figures making up single scenes. Whether the high proportion of sites with  Dynamic Figures in our study area is due to more thorough and detailed surveying and recording  methods used in the Mirarr Gunwarddebim Project, an unusually high density of Dynamic  Figures within Jabiluka or for other reasons can only be determined by comparative studies of  similarly systematically surveyed areas.  Recording method To ensure comprehensive survey coverage, the Jabiluka study area was divided into 500 × 500 m  survey units. This quadrat grid system was then used to guide the survey work. The survey teams  worked systematically through the quadrats, relocating sites that had been previously recorded  and documenting previously unrecorded ones. This is a time-consuming process that ensures  a certain level of confidence that the majority of sites have been recorded (or re-recorded) and are  appropriately documented within each survey quadrat. Once Dynamic Figures were identified  at a site, site recording forms were completed and information entered into both the Mirarr data  management system and the Dynamic Figure database. The recording and subsequent analysis  included attempts to allocate individual Dynamic Figures to Chaloupka’s phases. Analysis We now provide an analysis of the Dynamic Figures recorded within Jabiluka in line with the  methodology used by Chaloupka to construct his four-phase chronology.  In Table 6.1 we have attempted to categorise the Jabiluka Dynamic Figures into Chaloupka’s four  phases. This was done to determine the number of Dynamic Figures that actually conformed  to the parameters of his phases. Alongside of this, testing Chaloupka’s argument that the size of  Dynamic Figures relates to their place within the chronology is difficult, as he did not provide  exact parameters for size differences between phases. As such, Table 6.2 simply illustrates  the average size of anthropomorphs within a scene for both Phases 1 and Phase 2. Phase 2  anthropomorphs were classified as such based on their size similarities to Phases 3 and 4 and their  exclusion from Phase 3 and 4 based on other criteria such as single-line arms and ‘pointellistic’  characteristics. Phase 1 anthropomorphs are the largest remaining examples of Dynamic Figures  of the four phases. This is as close as we could come to replicating Chaloupka’s impressionistic  method of categorisation.  terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="9"> 6.

Overall, only 52 per cent (80 of the 155 examples) of Dynamic Figures we recorded conform  to one or other of Chaloupka’s four phases. No Jabiluka Dynamic Figure could be allocated to  Phase 4 alone.  In order to explore Chaloupka’s idea that the size of Dynamic Figures changed over time, we have  analysed the average size of each Dynamic Figure within given scenes. The results presented do  not show clear size differentiation between all of Chaloupka’s phases (Table 6.2). Rather, Phase 1  Dynamic Figures are generally of a range of sizes larger than those of the other phases, but other  factors may be influencing these findings. Phases within Mirarr Country Only slightly more than half of the Jabiluka Dynamic Figures conform to a single Chaloupka  phase (Table 6.1). Moreover, in many instances adjacent anthropomorphs composing individual  scenes belong to several of Chaloupka’s phases. A large proportion of the Dynamic Figures in our  analysis possess distinctive traits belonging to two or more of Chaloupka’s phases (Table 6.1).  A  similar situation of anthropomorphs not conforming to any one style has been noted for  western Arnhem Land rock art chronologies in the past (Brandl 1982; Chippindale and Taçon  1993; Lewis 1988). terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="10"> 118    The Archaeology of Rock Art in Western Arnhem Land, Australia Other problems are also evident in each of Chaloupka’s four-phase division. The Jabiluka  Dynamic  Figures show little distinction between Phase 1 and Phase 2 imagery. Chaloupka  (1993a:106) explains that Phase 1 consists of large, very finely executed examples of Dynamic  Figures compared to Phase 2 images, which are smaller yet equally as detailed and skilfully  depicted. If these phases are meaningful as chronological markers, Table 6.2 would need to show  a separate clustering of larger figures in Phase 1, with a clear decrease in size into Phase 2 and  possibly Phases 3 and 4. It should be noted, however, that Chaloupka never clearly stated whether  the decrease in size continued past Phase 2 and on to Phases 3 and 4.  There are other concerns with the Phase 1/Phase 2 division. The three largest scenes of Dynamic  Figures from our study area (e.g. Figure 6.5) suggest that the activities depicted in a scene may  influence how Dynamic Figures are depicted, indicating that size is a problematic temporal  indicator. These three scenes that have the Dynamic Figures in similar positions, with straight legs  and stretched out arms, are stylistically very different to each other; the thickness of lines, internal  patterns, form of limbs, etc. are dissimilar in each case (see Figure 6.5; Chaloupka 1993a:230,  Figure 263). The largest two scenes (Figure 6.5 and Chaloupka 1993a:230, Figure 263) appear  to depict cultural activities similar to each other in each scene, further signalling how the activity  may influence the size of the images. In each of these two latter scenes, a Dynamic Figure is  shown lying down with arms outstretched above its head, while another is crouching over it as it  performs some cultural activity over the lying figure.  Figure 6.5 The second-largest scene of the Jabiluka Dynamic Figures, depicting what appears to be  a similar cultural activity as evident in the largest scene. Two  anthropomorphs  are  depicted with  large  headdresses;  one  Dynamic  Figure  leans  over  another,  lying  figure.  Top  left:  Original photo of panel.

Dynamic Figures of Mirarr Country    119  A further issue with using size as a temporal indicator is that, in some scenes, one Dynamic Figure  is depicted considerably larger than the others (Figure 6.6). Ultimately, the size of Dynamic  Figures more likely relates to preferences of individual artists and artistic groups, or the purpose  of the scene and the desire by the artist to emphasise some particular individuals within a scene,  rather than to a chronological phase. The identification of Phase 3 is also problematic. In nine scenes from our research area, each  Dynamic Figure has its arms depicted as single-line strokes. It is this single-line convention that  characterises the Phase 3 Dynamic Figures (Figure 6.7). However, in six scenes one figure has  single-line arms, while other Dynamic Figures in those same scenes have muscular definition  in their arms (see Figure 6.6). These are examples of multiphase scenes, a phenomenon that  Chaloupka suggests does not exist. Each of these same scenes is stylistically diverse and covers  a range of image sizes.  Chaloupka (1993a:106, 1993b:93) specifies that Phase 3 single-line arms are specific to male  figures (he does not include indicators for female figures at all in his phases). However, in our  study, three of the scenes consist of female figures depicted with single-line arms together with  male or non-sexed Dynamic Figures with muscular arms. Furthermore, three scenes depict male  and female Dynamic Figures, each with muscular arms. Consequently, the stylistic criteria of the  single-line arm is better interpreted as a convention used by specific artists in certain paintings,  principally as its infrequency and presence in scenes with muscular arms do not suggest that this  convention can be used as a chronological indicator among Dynamic Figures.

It consists of one large Dynamic Figure being  speared, depicted in great detail, suggesting Phase 1. Around this large figure are three smaller  Dynamic Figures, one with muscular definition to its arms and the other two without, suggesting  both Phases 2 and 3. Finally, dots are used to provide animation to the scene, an aspect used  in all phases, as Chaloupka notes, but particularly in Phase 4 (Chaloupka 1993a:106, 1993b).  This scene alone provides enough evidence to debunk the four-phase chronology.  Figure 6.7 Two scenes of Dynamic Figures. The top set of four images are of a row of six Dynamic Figures all conforming to the Phase 3 convention of single-line arms.  Four anthropomorphs are running to the left while the last two are running to the right and standing, respectively. Each Dynamic  Figure wears a headdress. The bottom set of four images is of a scene of two Dynamic Figures intertwined with each other,  one with muscular arms and a female with single-line arms.

Dynamic Figures of Mirarr Country    121  No Dynamic Figures from our study area completely conform to Chaloupka’s ‘pointillistic’  fourth phase; that is, no Dynamic Figure has a body constructed of dots. Twenty scenes each have  at least one figure with a material culture object constructed of dots, often a headdress or pubic  skirt (Figure 6.8). However, these Dynamic Figures are stylistically diverse. Here each Dynamic  Figure also exhibits conventions present in the other three phases, such as single-line arms, large  sizes and so forth. As Phase 4 proper appears to be absent from the Jabiluka Dynamic Figures,  this phase could be restricted to areas away from where we undertook our study, or as we prefer  to see it, it is probably a regionally specific artistic convention limited to the Mt Brockman and  Deaf Adder Gorge areas rather than a temporal phase.  Figure 6.8 Two examples of Dynamic Figures with material culture objects constructed of dots.

The bottom set of  four  images  is a  running Dynamic Figure with a dot headdress. Such  depictions do not match precisely the Phase 4 Dynamic Figures that Chaloupka described, but nonetheless possess the dotting  attribute of Phase 4. For each set of four images: Top left: Panel.

Our rejection of this sequence implies that his conclusions about changing Aboriginal lifeways  for the broader period must also be reconsidered. For example, Chaloupka (1993a:106) suggested  that the presence of his four phases within a Dynamic Figures style indicates the long duration  of the overall style. While it still may be the case that Dynamic Figures were painted over a long  time, the phase evidence cannot be used to support this possibility. We further suggest that the absence of distinct chronological style phases among Dynamic Figures  from our study area in Mirarr Country signals the importance of variability in ways of depicting  among individual artists or artistic groups. The size differences between Dynamic Figures within  a scene are not directly related to the relative antiquity of those figures, but more likely signal  their narrative role (cf. May and Sanz 2010). In short, instead of viewing these stylistic traits  from an etic normative perspective, the stylistic pattern that Dynamic Figures do demonstrate  could be interpreted as a social and cultural positioning within and between those groups that  created the paintings. This situation may not be unique to Dynamic Figure art but is clearly  observed because of the quality of painting and skill of the artist(s). Furthermore, the sporadic  use of single-line arms may also represent a component of narrative purpose in Dynamic Figure  scenes. The ubiquity and uniformity of the convention in certain scenes, and select use in others,  visually articulate to viewers messages of formal differentiation within particular social scenarios. The absence of distinct phases in our study area also requires a reconsideration of Chaloupka’s  (1993a:106) arguments about the spatial distribution of Dynamic Figures across the western  Arnhem Land plateau. The geographical distribution of Dynamic Figures has been used to model  past socio-cultural boundaries across Arnhem Land. The contrasting spatial extent of Dynamic  Figures relative to later rock art styles has provided a point of departure for theoretical discussions  about Aboriginal lifeways through time. Such discussions have often included debate about  how changes in the art reflect changing environmental conditions (Chaloupka 1984a, 1988,  1993a, 1993b; Chippindale and Taçon 1998; Lewis 1988; Taçon and Brockwell 1995). Taçon  and Chippindale (1994) further discuss changes in artistic scenes where conflict is depicted.  They argue that, through time, smaller conflicts make way for large battles, which they see as  evidence of changing cultural organisation as the result of changing environmental conditions.  Lewis (1988) developed another hypothesis of how the size of cultural boundaries changed over  time, based upon the homogeneity of Dynamic Figures, his estimation of their age and the  environmental conditions of the period. Our results do not reject any of these conclusions per se,  as they are based on different methodologies, but the results of our analysis of Dynamic Figures  from the Jabiluka area demonstrate that variation between regions within western Arnhem Land  may well exist, something that needs further investigation.  Other results from our analysis suggest that variable conventions practised by individual artists  or regional artistic groups may be responsible for spatial and stylistic variations among Dynamic  Figures. For example, Chaloupka’s Phase 4 appears to be restricted to or concentrated within  a specific region. Similarly, individual Dynamic Figure styles also appear to be present within  our own study area. For example, the Jabiluka Dynamic Figures have four scenes in which the  anthropomorphs have unusually long arms, a trait that, to our knowledge, is not often found  elsewhere. Here the arms are often bent and are as long as or longer than the length of the torso  and legs combined (Figure 6.9). The Dynamic Figures in these scenes are stylistically similar to  each other, although they are differentially weathered. In other words, we have detected some  regional variability that may reflect the work of a particular artist or ‘school’. Such stylistic  variability across space is in line with Haskovec and Sullivan’s (1989:73) conclusion in relation  to Najombolmi’s art: ‘a small number of individuals may be responsible for a large proportion of  a particular body of art’. terra australis 47 </page> <page sequence="15"> 6.

Finally, as Chaloupka notes, Dynamic Figures represent one of the most visually exciting art  periods in the Arnhem Land sequence, a body of art crucial for understanding past Aboriginal  lifeways. Chaloupka argues that the depiction of Dynamic Figures (and the existence of a four- phase chronology) is uniform across Arnhem Land. Our research has concluded that Chaloupka’s  four phases are not accurate for the Jabiluka Dynamic Figure assemblage. Therefore, his proposed  temporal explanation for stylistic variation must also be rejected. We suggest that Chaloupka’s  conclusions about relationships between the Dynamic Figure rock art style, temporality and  artistic expressions need to be reconsidered.
