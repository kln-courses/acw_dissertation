Il voit avec indifférence les cha lands passer ou s'arrêter devant son étalage. L'acheteur est comme un fâcheux qui trouble son repos. J. Blanche (French Vice-Consul in Tripoli), Étude sur la Province de Tripoli de Syrie, 1856. Shortly after its emergence in the nineteenth century, homo œconomicus was deployed as a yardstick to measure individual economic behaviour irrespective of temporal and spatial differences. With the European penetration into the Levant, the concept was applied to the evaluation of the economic behaviour of locals. This led to the implicit conception of homo levanticus as the opposite of homo œconomicus. This pa per dwells upon primary sources and travelogues to make this point and then shifts the primacy from agents and their rationality to the institutional setup, in conform ity with the historical and institutional critiques of economic orthodoxy. i. Introduction During the nineteenth century, homo œconomicus gradually emerged as the catchword for the goal-oriented, rational, and calculating individual. As Adam Smith (1976 [1776], 1) put it, beneath the surface of every man a merchant innately gifted «with the propen sity to truck, barter, and exchange» in conformity with the market hy pothesis was identified (Schumpeter 1954; Ekelund Jr. and Hébert 1990; Screpanti and Zamagni 1995).' In retrospect, homo œconomicus reflects a * Address for correspondence: E-mail: ozveren@metu.edu.tr I would like to thank Joanna Minoglai, Peter Rosner and Michel Zonbaulakis and the two anonymous referees for their criticisms and suggestions on the earlier versions of this paper. The usual disclamer applies. 1 Smith originally meant to emphasize how every man was compelled to obtain what he needed for survival by recourse to other fellow men. This did not of itself describe any par ticular agency behaviour but only the motive for obtaining what one needed to survive. That</page><page sequence="2">io Eyüp Ôzveren combination of the so-called Protestant ethic with British utilitarianism, thereby being essentially a northwest European phenomenon. As Euro pean travel and business penetrated into the Mediterranean in general and the eastern half of it in particular, during the nineteenth century, the temptation to apply this economic rationality postulate to the Levantine character became irresistible. Various writings sought to explain why the peoples of the Levant were essentially different from those of the West by recourse to a conception of the Oriental character as manifest in a particular mind set (Said 1978). As such, during the nineteenth century, homo ceconomicus served as a yardstick for the specification of Europe's 'Other' as observed especially in the Eastern Mediterranean, that is, the Levant. This was a radical departure from what had been witnessed in the previous century. In the eighteenth century, European travellers to the Mediterranean had already observed certain differences of character and temperament and on this basis helped generalize a certain polarity between the North and the South that was essentially a precursor of the contrariety that was yet to crystallize between the East and the West in the nineteenth century. It took no less than a great mind, Johann Wolf gang Goethe, the great humanist, to resist the temptation to succumb to this prejudiced discourse. In his Italian Journey dating from 1786-1788 he dedicated an entire section to exploring such differences as far as the economic behaviour of the natives of Naples was concerned: Once in a while the good and ever-useful Volkmann forces me to dissent from his opinion. He asserts, for instance, that there are thirty to forty thousand lazy ne'er-do wells in Naples, and who does not repeat his words? Now that I am better acquainted with the conditions in the south, I suspect that this was the biased view of a person from the north, where anyone who is not feverishly at work all day is regarded as a loafer. When I first arrived, I watched the common people both in motion and at rest, and though I saw a great many who were poorly dressed, I never saw one who was unoccupied. I asked friends where I could meet all these idlers, but they couldn't show me any either. (Goethe 1970, 317; emphasis added) After a scrupulous evaluation of his observations, Goethe (1970, 320) concluded that, paradoxically, it was the poorest class that worked the hardest. Moreover, factors as real as the abundance that climatic condi tions and nature helped provide on an around-the-year basis, as well as disguised unemployment and underemployment linked with a sub sistence mentality were responsible for this characteristic divergence (Goethe 1970, 317-322). For Goethe, therefore, agency behaviour and this should take the form of a market exchange paved the way to the elaboration of a certain kind of agency behavior by his followers much later in the mid-nineteenth century. For the after-the-fact explicit characterization of homo economicus, institutional economists deserve particular emphasis (Veblen 1961, Gruchy 1972). However, prominent economists as diverse as Herbert Simon (1957), Kenneth Arrow (1987) and Amartya Sen (1982) have also questioned this predominantly neoclassical characterization.</page><page sequence="3">The Advent of homo ceconomicus in the Representations of the Levant n rationality followed from the context, natural or otherwise, and not the other way around. Furthermore, judging southern people with northern standards meant losing sight of the way this causality ran (Goethe 1970, 320). Italy was obviously not a part of the Levant nor was it of the same substance.1 However, the same commonplace cultural prejudice that obscured rather than explaining applied irrespective of whether the South or the East was concerned. For a correct understanding of the realities of either Italy or the Levant, one first had to remove this straightjacket imposed on Europe's 'Other(s)'. Only then could one truly assess how different the cases encountered in these culturally dis tant geographies were. Together with the social scientific outlook of the nineteenth century that worked by way of either North-South or East-West binary oppositions, Goethe's vision was inevitably lost for the worse. Goethe was certainly ahead of his contemporaries but also well ahead of the nineteenth century, just as he is still well ahead of many of us who follow blindly the conventions of our discipline that bear the mark of the nineteenth century. In order to reclaim Goethe's vision and to apply it to the vast and variegated geography of the Le vant, we need first to approach the nineteenth-century heritage of mo dernity so inextricably linked with the advent of homo ceconomicus from a critical perspective. The purpose of this paper is limited to achieving this discursive groundwork only, and as such, we will deliberately re frain from providing the economic history of what really happened on the ground. In other words, the scope of this article is to evaluate the European representation(s) of economic life in the Levant. A promising source for exploring the conceptual affinity between homo ceconomicus and what we will dub homo levanticus for the sake of convenience is provided in the numerous travelogues, eyewitness ac counts, and archival documents such as consular dispatches. These are primary sources largely unknown to economists and historians of economic thought. In addition, we will turn to the reminiscences of Jeremy Bentham and Nassau William Senior. Both are prominent fig ures in utilitarian philosophy and classical political economy that hap pened to travel extensively in the Eastern Mediterranean. Bentham's unpublished diary and letters of the year 1785 deposited in the British Museum, and Senior's A Journal Kept in Turkey and Greece in the Autumn of 185] and the Beginning of i8j8 deserve to be consulted in this context. Implicit in many texts is a history of the evolution and reinforcement as polar opposites of these two concepts, namely, homo oeconomicus and 1 In this respect, Italy has been a trendsetter. To this day, culturalist explanations of the pe culiarities of Italy (Banfield 1958, Putnam 1994) have remained in vogue and exert a formative influence on similar studies concerning the less developed parts of the world.</page><page sequence="4">12 Eyiip Ôzveren the homo levanticus. What we have before us is an explicit characteriza tion of a certain type of agency and its association with a specific ra tionality. This pair remains yet to be related with another factor, i.e. the institutional setup, that remains conspicuously absent in the very same sources. An institutional setup consists of formal and informal compo nents. Whereas the formal component consists of factors such as the laws and structure and organization of the state, the informal compo nent involves culture, norms and values. We insist that the informal institutional setup of the Levantine world was of major importance in producing this differential effect. A perusal at such sources suffices to demonstrate that the Europe an conception of homo œconomicus was all pervasive. As Smith stated, within a market society every man was a 'merchant' as far as the pur suit of self-interest was concerned. When we turn to the Levant,1 for the sake of saving space, we will focus exclusively on the merchants, to see whether or not they behaved as it was expected from merchants in conformity with the fundamental attributes of homo œconomicus. It would be absurd to expect the common folks to behave in conform ity with the 'economic man' if merchants did not do so. While we investigate the native merchants of the Levant as they figure in the sources, we will remain aware of three further factors. First, European observations might be biased in favour of trades that were traditionally characteristic of the Orient, and report only a certain fraction of total commercial activities. Second, we will keep in mind a tripartite division of mercantile activities, namely, long-distance trade, bazaar-embedded shop-keeping, and the busy hive of street vending. Third, we will bear in mind that the immediately visible phenomena such as shops and shopkeepers are more likely to strike the eye of the outside observer at the expense of the more hidden forms such as long-distance trade and street vending that lack temporal and spatial rigidity. 2. Homo œconomicus Makes his Début The Ottoman Empire was characterized by a predominantly agrarian economic system on the eve of opening-up to European influence and penetration by the twin steps of the Anglo-Ottoman Commercial Con vention of 18382 and the promulgation of the Tanzimat edict of 1839 1 What gave the Levant a unity was the legacy of the Ottoman Empire. During the sixteenth century the Eastern Mediterranean, the Levant and the Ottoman Empire became synonymous. 1 This was one of the many 'unequal treaties' imposed by the British upon the rest of the world at a time when the Corn Laws were not yet repealed in Britain and the Continent was reluctant to adopt free trade (Bairoch 1976,39-44; Wallerstein 1989,176). The Ottoman Empire, traditionally very receptive to imports trade, was further opened up (Bairoch 1993,41-42).</page><page sequence="5">The Advent of homo œconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 13 that reformed the institutional setup in accordance with the needs of international free trade. This has been labelled as the 'incorporation' into the modern world-system and the concomitant 'peripheraliza tiori of the Ottoman economy in the course of the nineteenth century (Wallerstein 1989,129-130). This meant a reversal of the relationship be tween the political and economic domains of power. Whereas before, the economic realm was embedded within the social whole as Karl Polanyi (1944, 57) would put it, or the Ottoman Empire constituted a 'world-empire' where the economy remained under the command of the political process as Immanuel Wallerstein (1974, 15-17) would de scribe it, after this turning-point, the economy attained a determining importance vis-à-vis the rest as well as being brought into the orbit of the international division of labour instead of being transformed into a 'world-economy' in its own right. This broad approach helps place the Ottoman economic history in perspective. Unfortunately, because of its emphasis on the black-and-white picture of the points of departure and arrival, it also misleads the reader into overlooking the grey tones that characterize much of this transitional longue durée. Even before this turning-point was reached, however, already during the eighteenth century, the Ottoman economic system was fairly commercialized be cause of the widespread practice of tax-farming that helped spread a market orientation and the rise of local potentates (ayans) who chal lenged the economic priorities1 of the central authority (McGowan 1994, Pamuk 2003). Fernand Braudel (1982,115) argues that the Ottoman Empire was no exception to the world of Islam noted for its narrow streets of numer ous shops and crowded markets where one could discern «all the char acteristics of the European market». Moreover, he gives us pace Traian Stoyanovich a useful description of the Ottoman economy: It was at grassroots level that the real economy of the Turkish Empire, an elementa ry but vigorous one, was to be found. Traian Stoyanovich has invented a picturesque name for it, 'the bazaar economy', that is a market economy articulated around the cities and regional fairs where exchange continued to obey traditional rules and was still, he argues, characterized by transparency and good faith. (Braudel 1984, 472; emphases added) The individual conduct characteristic of this bazaar economy could best be understood as gain-seeking within the parameters of the Po lanyi-esque principle of socially-embedded reciprocity overseen by a redistributive central State jealous to guard its dominant position over the entire economic system as well as the social hierarchy within which 1 The classical economic priorities of the central authority consisted of provisionism (of Is tanbul) in approaching foreign and domestic trade, fiscalism in defining overall economic policy objectives, and traditionalism in methods of production (Genç 2000,59-66).</page><page sequence="6">14 Eyüp Ôzveren the economic system was enveloped.1 Irrespective of the dominant mode of economic conduct, this economic system was far from being either exclusively agrarian or primitive : The economic empire which underpinned the Turkish Empire was defended by a multitude of merchants who thwarted and reduced penetration by westerners. France (that is Marseille) was represented in the Levant by perhaps 40 trading posts, staffed by 150 or 200 persons at most, and the same was true of the other 'nations' in the Levant ports. Everyday transactions were handled by Arab, Armenian, Jewish, Indian or Greek merchants (the latter category including besides authentic Greeks, Macedo-Rumanians, Bulgarians and Serbs) and even by Turks, though on the whole a career in commerce held little attraction for the latter. The Levant swarmed with ambulant salesmen, retailers, shopkeepers in their dark little stores, commission agents from every geographical and ethnic group and of every social status. Tax farmers, wholesalers and real businessmen, capable of lending money to govern ments, were not far away either. The fairs, gigantic meetings where business worth millions of piastres was transacted, channelled an uninterrupted flow of men, mer chandise and beasts of burden. (Braudel 1984, 480) Complex as this economic system was, the mode of agency behaviour that operated within its limits had not yet been transformed into what it would become in the next stage. In other words, we can speak of a long transition where the mode of economic conduct displayed a certain lag in adjustment to the new context. Without reference to the Ottoman Em pire, Max Weber had summarized the general process at work well: The course of development involves on the one hand the bringing in of calculation into the traditional brotherhood, displacing the old religious relationship. As soon as accountability is established within the family community, and economic rela tions are no longer strictly communistic, there is an end of the naive piety and its repression of the economic impulse... At the same time there is a tempering of the unrestricted quest of gain with the adoption of the economic principle into the in ternal economy. The result is a regulated economic life with the economic impulse functioning within bounds. (Weber 1981,356) This process was far from being complete and even when it would eventually be so, the result would hence not be a homo œconomicus un bound. This section is intended to dwell upon the characterization of the Levant before and during the arrival of homo œconomicus. The purpose here is not to describe the further details of the general picture. The above summary is provided only to permit the reader to evaluate the representations below with respect to this information. Our motive here is to emphasize that even Bentham and Senior, known to be the 1 Braudel 1982, 595 notes how the sultan «changed his high society as he might his shirt» in order not to permit the development of an independent social stratum that could escape from his control.</page><page sequence="7">The Advent of homo œconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 15 most economistic of the classical writers, refrained from indulging themselves fully in the kind of representational discourse that would emerge with the appearance of the economic man. If Bentham and Senior (until he finally yielded to the temptation) did not do so, hardly anyone else among their contemporaries would. Therefore the Euro pean representations in this era were more realistic and got the causal ity between agency behaviour and institutional setup right until Senior finally with his last words on the Ottoman Empire reversed the pat tern. Among the eyewitness accounts of the Ottoman Empire that of Wil liam Eton holds a special place. Eton had already served as the Dutch Consul at Basra and established a trading concern in Istanbul together with a Russian merchant in 1776. No wonder that he became one of the pioneers of the British trade in the Black Sea in the early nine teenth century (Anderson 1956,160). His A Survey of the Turkish Empire, published in London in 1798, reflects the State of the region as seen by a well-informed European resident during the closing decades of the eighteenth century. Of particular importance to us is the chapter iv of the book entitled «Of Arts and Sciences, Commerce, and General Manners». Noting a general lack of curiosity for science, Eton (1798, 217) recounts a telling case of «detached instances of skill among the Turks in various arts and sciences» that also entails a cross-cultural comparison: A remarkable instance occurred to my knowledge of an individual fact, which might have been of utmost use to society, but which, owing to the state of knowl edge and government in Turkey, was wholly lost to the world. An Arabian, at Con stantinople, had discovered the secret of casting iron, which, when it came out of the mould, was as malleable as hammered iron; some of his fabrication was acci dentally shown to Mr. de Gaffron, the Prussian chargé d'affaires, and Mr. Franzaroli (men of mineralogical science) who were struck with the fact, and immediately instituted an enquiry for its author. This man, whose art in Christendom would have insured him a splendid fortune, had died poor and unknown, and his secret had perished with him! His utensils were found, and several pieces of his casting, all perfectly malleable. Mr. Franzaroli analysed them, and found that there was no admixture of any other metal. Mr. de Gaffron has since been made superintendent of the iron manufactory at Spandau, where he has in vain attempted to discover the process of the Arabian. (Eton 1798, 227-228) What is at issue here is lack of incentive to innovate - assuming there is an invention1 - because of institutional constraints such as the state of 1 Whether or not this invention was technically correct is beside the point here. It should be emphasized that we are dealing here with a potential innovation that could have important bearings from the military point of view. Given the militaristic bent of the Ottoman Empire,</page><page sequence="8">16 Eyiip Ôzveren knowledge and the discouraging attitude of the 'despotic' government and religion, not to mention the insecurity of property (Eton 1798,194, 239). However, nowhere does Eton ascribe a particular behaviour as responsible for the economic backwardness of the Ottoman subjects. This observation of the resistance to innovation does not lead - as it logically could - to the emphasis of habitual, routine-based agency be haviour either. In assessing the moral character of traders, Eton con cedes the integrity of the Turks in comparison with that of the Greeks and Armenians that left much to be desired. Interestingly enough, Eton (1798, 241-242) traces the misconduct of the Greek and Armenian mer chants to the institutional factors that induce them to act as such: Honesty, however, it is said, in some measure distinguishes the Turkish merchant: this may perhaps be true, if we compare him with the crafty Greek, or still more subtle Armenian, who, from the unjust oppressions under which they labour, are induced to retaliate by artifice, on their imperious masters, the source of half that tricking and deception commonly laid to the charge of the lower orders of society. One might be tempted to think this may be so because of the discrimi nating attitude of Eton in favour of the Christian minorities. However, Eton (1798, 248) makes a similar case for the Turks: The Turk has indeed a good capacity, and an habitual prudence, but his government and religion are eternal bars to his improvement. Openness of mind and benevo lence cannot exist where despotism renders every man suspicious, nor can the vo tary of an intolerant and sanguinary religion cultivate liberality and science. While advising prospective customers about how to deal with the ba zaar merchants of Istanbul, another European traveller, J. E. Kay (1833, 79-80) noted the likeness of the Turk and the Armenian, not to men tion others amidst a tendency towards the convergence of commercial conduct: In making purchases, it is necessary to be on your guard, if you would avoid the grossest imposition. The Armenian, Greek, Persian, and Jewish shopkeepers do not hesitate to ask, at first, double the price which they mean eventually to take, and the Turk is fast falling into the same practice." we could infer that if the Ottomans were not open to innovation in this one domain of great est concern to themselves, they would be all the more indifferent in other fields. The Ottoman attitude to invention as categorically belonging to the past rather than being the manifesta tion of an ongoing process has attracted attention: «With the Moslem every invention, every discovery, dates from the day of the Prophet or that of his immediate successors» (Sutcliffe 1896, 826). A biased discourse of this kind allowed no differentiation between Turks and Arabs and treated them under the rubric of Moslems. We believe they could be treated as same only when they are contained within the same informal as well as formal institutional setup. 1 However, the Italian writer Edmondo de Amicis (1896, t, 139-140), who visited Istanbul many years later, insisted that the Turkish merchants were still unlike the Greeks, Armenians, and Jews insofar as they resisted the temptation to quote a high initial price and to engage in bargaining.</page><page sequence="9">The Advent of homo œconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 17 Gregory Wortabet (1856,1,39), a Syrian-born convert to Protestantism, with a fairly hybrid identity, in a parallel fashion, attributed the ongo ing degeneration in the habits of the natives in Beirut to the differential impact of foreign influence across the lines of ethnicity and religion: It is said that the Mahomedan is more trustworthy than the Christian; this fact is true; and is thus accounted for on the same principle as the Christian of the interior is more honest than he of Bayroot, so is the Mahomedan of Bayroot honester than his Christian neighbour. The spirit of duplicity which characterises the Christians of Bayroot, they have learnt from their intercourse with foreigners. Therefore these sources acknowledge an ongoing homogenization process brought about under the impact of encounter with foreigners that eroded whatever difference, if any, along ethnic lines might have existed in the first place. Hence, we are back at where Eton had left us as far as the determining influence of the context over the agent was concerned. William Eton had received a letter from Jeremy Bentham, written from Yassi on January 8th, 1786. Bentham was travelling from Istanbul to meet his brother Samuel who was then stationed in southern Russia as an entrepreneur-turned lieutenant-colonel, placed in charge of the industrial complex in Krichev of Prince Potyomkin where the first pan opticon in the world would have been set up were it not for the Prince's decision to sell his estate on the eve of the Russo-Ottoman War of 1787 (Christie 1970, 234-240). Samuel Bentham and Eton knew each other well1 as resident Europeans in this part of the world, for if they had not, paraphrasing Jeremy Bentham (quoted in Tappe 1950, 69), «they would be as Robinson Crusoe». Jeremy Bentham wrote to Eton his frank impressions of the lands he travelled through. As a learned man with a deep interest in political economy, Bentham was thrilled to find in the library of a foreigner in Bucharest, a copy of the Wealth of Na tions.* Yet Bentham refrained from applying political economy to the reality before his bare eyes. Somehow, the landscape before him defied classification in terms of political economy. It was probably more a matter of collective mentalité (Le Goff 1978) than of individual psychol ogy when he observed: «At Russchuk as elsewhere, the Turks I imagine are too ignorant to be jealous; manufactures, like plants, they look upon as nailed to the soil; what hitherto has been, according to them, always will be» (Bentham quoted in Tappe 1950,69). Nevertheless, while he con 1 In fact, as early as in the summer of 1780, Samuel Bentham and Eton had visited together the Ukraine and the new port of Kherson (Anderson 1956,160). 2 Copies of this highly interesting book were not readily available in these countries. In 1784, Samuel Bentham had also requested from his brother Jeremy in England the new edition of the Wealth of Nations that later disappeared from his collection (Christie 1987, 29).</page><page sequence="10">18 Eyüp Ózveren sciously refrained from viewing the Black Sea world along the lines of po litical economic analysis, Bentham referred to resident Englishman Eton as a «politico-economist good enough to know how things of no value acquire one by mere change of place» (Tappe 1950,72). Even the founder of utilitarian philosophy, Bentham, had reservations about applying this mode of inquiry into the explanation of the Ottoman difference. Where as political economy was personified in this resident European merchant, the assessment of the economic rationality of natives and the postulates of utilitarian philosophy were treated separately, except for a passing remark. In fact, when travelling in the Thrace, Bentham had noted the lack of private initiative in planting cabbage in the vicinity of Lüleburgaz where there would be a market at hand (Tappe 1969, 520). However he had not drawn further conclusions from it, nor had he attempted gener alizations. Well into the nineteenth century, the awareness of a substantial differ ence in institutional setups served to spare the Ottoman domain from the application of a utilitarian anthropology of individual conduct as the modus operandi of social and economic life. It is no coincidence that Senior, who visited the Ottoman Empire as late as in 1857-1858, did not differ from Bentham in his hesitation to link his interests in political economy with his Orientalist indulgences. While recounting his im pressions of the sites of antiquity in detail, nowhere did Senior give an account of the bazaars in the Orientalist fashion, nor did he relate entrepreneurial behaviour to religious motives. In order not to take the responsibility of fusing the disparate discourses of Oriental Studies and Political Economy, Senior designed the device of developing his arguments about the then current state and prospects of the Ottoman Empire by introducing a number of unidentified characters - some of whom could have been merely fictional - who took the floor to express views that were carefully orchestrated by the questions Senior posed. Finally, through the words of one such character in the closing section, Senior (1858, 227-228) reveals the ultimate cause for the miserable state of the Ottoman Empire : The distinguishing character of the real Asiatic is, intellectual sterility and unfitness for change. ...An Asiatic had rather copy than try to invent, rather acquiesce than discuss, rather attribute events to destiny than to causes that can be inquired into and explained. His only diplomacy is war; his only internal means of government are poison, the stick, and the bowstring. In the Turk these peculiarities are exaggerated. Whatever be his purpose, he uses the means which require the least thought. If he has to create a local government, he simply hands over the Pasha all the powers of the Sultan. If he wants money, he takes it wherever he can find it ; and if he cannot get it by force, he puts up to auction power, justice, the prosperity, and indeed the subsistence, of his subjects... He relies</page><page sequence="11">The Advent of homo ceconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 19 on the rain for washing his streets, on the dogs for keeping them free from offal, on the sun for making passable the tracks which he calls roads, and on the climate for enabling him to live in his timber house without repairing it. For everything else he relies on Allah, and entreats God to do for him what he is too torpid to do for him self. His fatalism is, in fact, indolence in its most exaggerated form. It is an escape, not only from exertion, but from deliberation. Hence, in the course of the nineteenth century, there emerged a re versal of the causality between individual agents and institutional fac tors in the descriptions of the Levant by foreigners that was the effect of an ongoing shift within the field of Classical Political Economy. To this effect, a great divide preparing the début of the 'economic man is traceable within the domain of descriptive representations. Whereas formerly the behaviour of individual agents was largely interpreted as the effect of broader forces at work at the level of structure, as of then, individual motives came to be highlighted as the cause of over all tendencies. In this context, as the institutional factors receded to the background in European accounts, the descriptions of the Levant in general and of economic life in particular, acquired an increasingly anthropomorphic character. Travellers to the Levant were increasingly infused with the utilitarian liberal philosophy. They concentrated on interpreting the conduct of Ottoman subjects against the rather col ourful backdrop of Oriental bazaars. The appearance and transforma tion of the shopkeeper, the shop and the bazaar in the travelogues bear witness to this profound shift. 3. A Guided Tour of the Oriental Shop and its Aftermath For many centuries, cities of the Levant continued to impress the Euro pean travellers with their large and lively bazaars that brought together the diverse merchandise and peoples of a vast geography. The dynamism of the bazaars is much noted by all observers. While one eyewitness, the Norwegian writer Knut Hamsun characterized such bazaars of Istanbul as late as in 1899 as the sites of tales such as Thousand and One Nights come true, another, the Danish writer Hans Christian Andersen, as early as in 1841 compared them favourably with the shopping district of the Palais Royal (Hamsun and Andersen 1993, 59, 98). The best description of the labyrinthine Grand Bazaar together with the nearby Egyptian Ba zaar in Istanbul as a «world-embracing, perpetual fair» (1896,1,123) was provided in 1874 by the Italian writer Edmondo de Amicis (1896,1,131): Every separate kind of merchandise has its own especial quarter, its little street, corridor, and square ; there are a hundred small bazars [bazaars] opening one into another [...] each bazar is at the same time a museum, a promenade, a market, and a theatre...</page><page sequence="12">20 Eyüp Ozveren Against this dynamic spectacle of the bazaars was placed the generic image of shops. It would be appropriate to start with the characteriza tion of the spatial morphology of the shop in early nineteenth century. J. E. Kay (1833, 79-80) described a shop in the bazaar of Istanbul, thereby providing us with a generic image: A description of one shop will serve for all. It is a little stall, about ten or twelve feet square, hung round with the various articles exposed for sale: like the shops of Pompeia, they are entirely open in front, and are closed at night by hanging shut ters, which serve as an awning during the day. The floor of the stall is raised two feet from the ground; and upon a small rug, spread out on this floor, sits the cross-legged Turkish or Armenian shopkeeper. A small door behind him opens into a little recess or apartment, where those articles are kept which cannot be conveniently exposed in the stall. When the renowned French author Théophile Gautier visited Istanbul in 1852, he left behind a testimony of the shopkeeper. He infused the above spatial morphology with a further Orientalist specification of the characteristics of the shopkeeper: An Oriental shop is very different from a European one. It is a sort of alcove cut out of the wall, and closed at night with shutters that are let down like the ports of a ship. The dealer, sitting cross-legged upon a bit of matting of Smyrna carpet, idly smokes his chibouque, or counts with careless fingers the beads of his chaplet, with an impassible, indifferent look, preserving the same attitude for hours at a time, and apparently caring very little whether he has a customer or not. Purchasers generally stand outside in the street and examine the goods heaped up on the stall without the smallest attempt on the owner's part to set these off to advantage. The art of dressing windows, carried to such a high degree in France, is wholly unknown or disdained in Turkey. (Gautier 1901, 74)1 This fundamentally fatalistic attitude was yet to be replaced by a Eu ropean type self-interested profit-seeking by way of competition. It was impossible to observe typical capitalistic behaviour in the Otto man Empire, where capitalism had not yet printed its mark. Another eyewitness to the nineteenth-century Ottoman Empire whose account 1 A similar observation was made in early nineteenth century: «The Turks do not under stand that nicety of arrangement which produces so much effect in our metropolitan shops ; and with the exception of the perfume and silk merchants, and perhaps one or two others, they are singularly slovenly in the disposition of their merchandize» (Pardoe, ii, 1837, 46). A French consular dispatch from Tripoli dated 1856 reflected the same impulse to interpret the behavior of the provincial shopkeepers in a way strikingly parallel to that of Gautier (Blanche 1983,340). As for the bazaars of Damascus, Addison 1973, 207 observed: «The different manu factures of silk and cotton intermixed with gold threat are most beautiful. But as the shop keepers do not expose their choice goods in their shops and bazaars, which have no glass windows to protect them as in London, one may go away from Damascus without seeing the choiciest and most beautiful of the articles for sale, unless inquiry is made among those merchants and shopkeepers who sell the more costly and expensive articles».</page><page sequence="13">The Advent of homo œconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 21 came out in 1856 depicted the European counterpart he had in mind, once again for the purpose of comparison: In the west Europe the term tradesman conjures up the idea of a man standing stiff and starch upright behind a counter in a shop, or seated from morning till night at a desk in a narrow, dismal office, from which he cannot even descry a corner of the sky, ignorant generally of all that transpires apart from his branch of trade. (Ubicini 1973 [1856], 311) The solitary yet purposeful and rational individual of European origin was rather a political-economic construct on the way to a conception of civil society, as Marx (1977, 83) remarked: «In this society of free competition, the individual appears detached from the natural bonds etc. which in earlier historical periods make him the accessory of a definite and limited human conglomerate». The Enlightenment tradi tion invested much in the individual as the building block of civil soci ety. However, civil society, a focus of the Scottish Enlightenment,1 was, soon obscured by the institution of the market, the earthly manifesta tion of a benevolent invisible hand as Adam Smith put it in his Wealth of Nations. Reconstituted as the market notion of political economy, this became a metaphoric arena for the interaction of infinitely many atomistic individuals: the wily solitary is already homo œconomicus, for whom all reasonable things are alike: hence the Odyssey is already a Robinsonade. Both Odysseus and Crusoe, the two shipwrecked mariners make their weakness (that of the individual who parts from the collectivity) their social strength. Delivered up to the mercy of the waves, helplessly isolated, their very isolation forces them recklessly to pursue an atomistic interest. They embody the principle of capitalist economy, even before they have recourse to a servant. (Adorno and Horkheimer 1979, 61) The European historical as well as discursive experience with the homo œconomicus helped shape the image of homo levanticus that emerged within the field of vision of the foreigners who had a chance to observe and interpret the Ottoman way of life. For example, Senior (1859,109) quoted one view on the habitual likelihood of the Turks to indulge in 'conspicuous and wasteful consumption', and in so doing, he had in mind the European standard for assessing the difference: «Turks do not read, do not talk; their only object is to get money, to be spent in immediate pleasure or ostentation, on fine women, fine horses, or fine horses run up with wood...».1 Still another character cited in the 1 Instead of taking it for granted as has become the practice with the advent of liberalism and the classical political economy, the conditions of existence of a civil society were exam ined by Adam Ferguson, the author of An Essay on the History of Civil Society (Gellner 1994, 61-80). 1 There was a chronic scarcity of money in the Ottoman Empire that obtained its gold</page><page sequence="14">22 Eyüp Ôzveren same text was allowed to observe the incapacity of the Turks to act in accordance with the logical terms of a revenue-expenditure calculus, distinctive of the homo œconomicus: «Most of the Turkish proprietors are heavily in debt; they do not know what are their incomes or ex penditure» (Senior 1859,123). Precisely because the European image of the businessman was to be gradually linked in the minds of many with the Protestant ethic, there emerged a tendency to move from homo levanticus as a general category to its specifically Ottoman version and to look behind it for a religious difference attributable to the essence of Islam. In this way, the Ottoman businessman were represented as the adverse of the thriving Protestant with a strong sense of work combined with a temptation to resist the enjoyment of earthly delights as dictated with a commitment to frugality and abstinence (Weber 1958). Quite the contrary, the very assumption of a one-to-one relationship between Islam as a religion dictating a moral code and a particular business conduct leaves much to be questioned: The same effect of doctrine appears in the lack of business solidarity between dealer and customer seen among the Mohammedans of the city. You go into a shop in the Bazaars to buy a rug. The pious owner of the shop is engaged in prayer upon the low platform which takes the place of the counter. When he has finished his prayers, he sells you a rug, demanding three times the regular price for it. If you leave it to him to send home, he will send you a poorer article, and will insist that this was the one which you bought. (Dwight 1901, 78) It should be noted that many of the merchants and shopkeepers ob served by the Europeans were actually members of the non-Muslim communities (millet) who showed a strong presence in economic life. As such, the archetypal image of the local businessman evolving in the perceptions of the foreigners was inevitably biased in their favour. While they were certainly contained under homo levanticus, they were far from being the incarnation of an essential ethos attributed to Islam. The only way they could still be consistently interpreted as such would require the characterization of homo levanticus as derivative of the over all pervasive culture and its religiously-determined institutions.1 But this would require a second reversal of the causality between the indi and silver from abroad. This was one reason why money was favored most by the individu als. Especially when consumption soared by emulating the West in the nineteenth century, the preference of the rich for holding money rather than other assets increased further. This posed a further behavioral constraint on investment for the sake of capital accumulation in conformity with capitalist mentality. 1 Max Weber (1978, n, 1095), the leading social scientist of the era to explore the relationship between religions and entrepreneurial spirit, was well aware of the difference : « Industrializa tion was not impeded by the Islam as the religion of individuals - the Tartars in the Russian</page><page sequence="15">The Advent of homo ceconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 23 vidual and the context, in other words a return to where it all started in the first place. Such a profound reversal would threaten the conditions of existence of the new anthropomorphic paradigm and was unaccept able. 4. Arguments for an Alternative Account of Cultural Differences The dichotomy consisting of homo ceconomicus and homo levanticus sharpened by a religious interpretation must have inevitably intro duced a Eurocentric and hence Orientalist distortion into the picture.1 Obviously, the discursive representation of the local merchant was not entirely a fabrication but nevertheless much exaggerated. Instead of proceeding in the futile direction of taking Islam as an explanation for the exceptionalism involved, we insist, one could take an entirely dif ferent course. Having circumnavigated the exaggeration in the façade, one could search for materially relevant explanations of the particular ism in question that could help identify a different type of rationality at work in the place of seeming irrationality. 4.1. Gain Motive versus the Subsistence Motive In line with the above suggestion, for example, the very indifference of the shopkeepers to their potential customers may well be explained. One such explanation would emphasize the limited number of sellers who share a traditional marketplace, given a practically constant level of economic activity. Under such circumstances, a kind of 'subsistence shop keeping' motive would be at work. The memoirs of an Ottoman statesman attest further to the subsistence-minded peculiarity of the shopkeepers. Sadullah Pasha, upon his return from Berlin, one day went to the book dealers' market where he bought several books but could not make up his mind as to whether or not buy another one. Shortly after leaving, he decided to return to the shop to make this further purchase. Surprised to find the shop closed within such a short interval, he inquired about the whereabouts of the dealer. Neighbour ing store owners surprised him further by approvingly stating that af ter having sold a few books to make his daily living, the shopkeeper had closed his shop for the day (N. A. Kansu cited in Sayar 1986, 97). This kind of behaviour was by no means peculiar to Istanbul. Worta Caucasus are often very 'modern' entrepreneurs -, but by the religiously determined struc ture of the Islamic States, their officialdom and their jurisprudence». 1 Without the paradigm-shifting stimulus of the recent literature on Orientalism (Abdel Malek 1963, Said 1978) and Eurocentrism (Amin 1988) the problematic of this work may not have materialized.</page><page sequence="16">24 Eyüp Ôzveren bet (1856,11,14), the Syrian-born Christian, in his memoirs of the Arab East, noted how [t]he merchants «had long closed their stores and gone home, though it was barely four o'clock in the afternoon». The hypothesis that the livelihood of the shopkeeper's households as economically meaningful units depended only in part on their earnings from their business could also serve well to explain behavioural oddities. The shopkeepers in question were not exactly and exclusively specialized between trade and agriculture, not to mention the service sector. As for specialization within a trade, J. E. Kay (1833, 81) observed in the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul: «In many districts, such as the seal-cutters, diamond workers, pipemakers &amp;c., the same little stall serves both as a place to sell their wares and as a workshop to manufacture them». Furthermore, specific institutional factors such as the survival of guilds and corpora tions (Senior 1859,135; Sutcliffe 1896) that restricted entry into trade and cultivated a sense of solidarity in the place of rivalry among the members (Baer 1970a, 24, and 1970b, 148; Koçu 2002) may further serve to explain this otherwise puzzling behaviour. Therefore, the limits to competition posed by the structure of the markets and the organization of trades may well be the cause and not the effect of the conspicuous absence of the Levantine homo œconomicus. As for the numerous observations that the Greek, Armenian and Syrian Christians had a tendency to cheat foreigners by overcharging them and the Turks were learning fast the same practice because they were all corrupted in the process of their dealings with the Europeans may also have an explanation. What was at work here beyond mere corrupting influence was a deeper process of intercultural learning. The Ottoman shopkeepers increasingly learnt to differentiate between 'foreigners' and natives of their lot, and to act accordingly in their com mercial dealings. Max Weber (1981, 356) offers us an explanation of the process at work: Originally, two opposite attitudes toward the pursuit of gain exist in combination. Internally, there is attachment to tradition and to pietistic relations of fellow mem bers of tribe, clan, and house-community, with the exclusion of the unrestricted quest of gain within the circle of those bound together by religious ties; externally, there is absolutely unrestricted play of the gain spirit in economic relations, every foreigner being originally an enemy in relation to whom no ethical restrictions ap ply; that is, the ethics of internal and external relations are categorically distinct. Whereas before, natives confronted foreigners only within the realm of long-distance trade, with the arrival of Europeans in the Levant, every shop itself became an intercultural meeting place. Therefore a conduct typical of long-distance merchants (of which more will be said below) became increasingly manifest in this local domain. It was yet to be fully internalized by the native shopkeepers and applied to their</page><page sequence="17">The Advent of homo œconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 25 fellow countrymen. Edmondo de Amicis (1896, 1, 123) observed that at the fish-market where all the vendors were Turks and the custom ers locals, bargaining was short and brief, confined to «monosyllables». By contrast, in the Grand Bazaar there were unspecialized «Frankish» shops specifically designed for the European visitors that dealt in a «lit tle of everything» as if they were a miniature bazaar in themselves. The neighbourhood shopkeepers switched languages as they conspired among themselves against foreign customers who could hardly resist: The shopkeepers here are great solemn knaves, thoroughly well versed in every art appertaining to their business, and, polyglot like their brothers of the trade, have a certain dramatic power which they employ in the most entertaining manner to tempt people to buy, sometimes rising to the level of genuinely good acting. (de Amicis, 1896,1,137-138 and 152) 4. 2. Lessons of Typology Notwithstanding the need to challenge the image of the static busi nessman by way of alternative rationalities, it is indeed necessary to further explore the creative institutional forms that commerce had taken in the course of time in the Ottoman world. The vignettes of shops and bazaars should not obscure the variety of vital forms under which business was instituted. As already hinted before, the sharp con trast of Levantine businessman's conduct with the implications of the so-called 'economic man' has been most noted in the case of localized tradesmen and shopkeepers operating within a marketplace setting. Of the three types of businessman, that is, long-distance merchants, shopkeepers, and street-vendors, this group occupies the middle stra tum. Ubicini, whom we have quoted above for his characterization of the European tradesman, depicts at length the long-distance merchant as the counterpart: Hence we do not and cannot form a very clear idea of the elevated and poetical instincts that are developed amongst men of this same profession in the East, by the habits of long journeys, by frequenting the desert, by passing almost the whole of their lives, at night under canvas, by day in the open air, sub divo. Yet the merchant and trader of ancient times presented the same characteristics as the present trader in Turkey and Persia, minus the poetical sphere peculiar to the sky and customs of the East. (Ubicini 1973 [1856], 311-312)1 As far as the conduct of long-distance merchants in search of moderate 1 The parallel Ubicini draws with the antiquity ought to be further elaborated: «The be havior of Odysseus the wanderer is reminiscent of that of the casual barterer. In the pathetic image of the beggar, feudal man retains the features of the oriental merchant, who returns with unheard-of riches because for the first time, and contrary to tradition, he has stepped outside the milieu of a domestic economy, and 'embarked for other lands'» (Adorno and Horkheimer 1979, 61).</page><page sequence="18">26 Eyïip Ôzveren if not windfall profits is concerned, local values, Islamic or otherwise, did not dictate a different route than that of long-distance merchants of the European past. Moreover, there was a logical explanation for the minor differences encountered in the conduct of Levantine mer chants: The merchant who travels by caravan, has really few risks to encounter, and but tri fling expenses. He lodges without expense, and in full security, in a Han; he is never alarmed by the dangers of fluctuations of price ; he has nothing to fear from the ignorance and dishonesty of an agent or broker; he brings his goods, or his money, to be exchanged for the articles he wants; sees, and examines it before he buys; he has not the precarious chance of realizing a large fortune, but he has the certainty of reaping the reward of his industry. With very small capital speculations can be undertaken. A merchant can commence traffic without corporate rights or previous connexion; intelligence, industry, perseverance, and frugality, are the qualifications he requires, and however small may be his profits, if his expenses are still smaller, he considers himself on the road to wealth. (Urquhart 1833,137)' It would hence be self-contradictory to assume that agency is all that matters as an analytical point of departure and to think that the very same Levantine merchants displayed European-type rationality in one domain of specialization whereas they incarnated exactly the opposite in the other. The behavioural convergence of European as well as Le vantine merchants within the context of long-distance trade deserves emphasis.2 This is all the more ironical since long-distance trade con stitutes the one realm where the relevance of the homo œconomicus as a behavioural ideal-type is most disputable. After all, long-distance trade was one domain where the activities of the agent cut across several institutional setups. As such, the formative influence of a particular setup on the economic agent was reduced significantly as the agent in question became more and more familiarized with various institution al setups in which he had to operate. In a way he had to fall back upon his own resources as an economic agent. Moreover, this domain was distinguished by the absence of full information, the all-pervasive un 1 One may at first sight be surprised by the remark of a European that a merchant traveling by caravan would encounter few risks. However, the implicit comparison here is with the one who is not traveling by caravan, that is, who is on his own, and who would encounter far greater risks because of his exposure to banditry and theft along the insecure routes. Tradi tionally, foreign merchants were not allowed to take part in the organization of caravan trade that remained an exclusive privilege of the native merchants. Hence foreigners were practi cally excluded from much of domestic long-distance trade of the Levant. As Braudel 1984,476 observed, this monopoly was most difficult to break and hence is the meaning of the above envious remark of a European observer. 2 A long-time French Consul in Beirut, Henri Guys (1862, 1, 204-207), noted with fear the enterprising Arab merchants who ventured into the long-distance European trade and en croached upon the historic French privileges at the European endpoint of the trade networks by virtue of their easier access to the hinterland. He insisted that the French should enter into partnerships that would help contain their native rivals as intermediaries.</page><page sequence="19">The Advent of homo œconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 27 certainty, and the concomitant presence of risk that made any rational cost-benefit calculus virtually impossible.1 One could mostly proceed with reliance on habits and routines as well as on bounded rationality at best. Within such a context, a long-distance merchant had to exploit the opportunities presented by minute knowledge-differentials, take risks, and venture into the domain of the unknown in a way contradictory to the predictable logic implied by the so-called economic man (Braudel 1982).2 If anything, the long-distance merchant fitted better with the Schumpeterian conception of the 'entrepreneur' as the persona causa of economic change than with the generic homo œconomicus of the static model of economy as summarized under the concept of the 'circular flow of economic life' (Schumpeter 1989). This approximation is justi fied only to some extent by the fact that the effect of multiple institu tional setups in which the merchant operated was to cancel each other out. Braudel insists that non-European long-distance merchants cover ing a terrain that extended from the Levant well into the Indian Ocean were, far from being 'pedlars', the «agents of altogether higher status, sometimes even wholesalers», in fact, the sovereigns of a domain char acterized by «the capitalist aspects this long-distance trade was already displaying, whether one likes it or not» (Braudel 1982,120,122). Already during the classical age of the Ottoman Empire, these merchants were hard to distinguish from their European counterparts: in April 1589, when the roundship Ferrera left Malamocco, the outer port of Ven ice, there sailed with her, alongside the Italian merchants (Venetians, Lombards and Florentines) 'Armenians, Levantines, Cypriots, Candians, Maronites, Syrians, Geor gians, Greeks, Moors, Persians and Turks.' All these merchants were undoubtedly trading on the same terms as the westerners. They are to be found in the records of Venetian and Anconan notaries as well as under the columns in the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. They did not feel at all out of place. (Braudel 1982,124; emphasis added) The lowest level of the tripartite division of commercial undertakings corresponds to the world of the street-vendor where the dismember ment of traditional guild structures must have progressed most rapidly.3 1 A popular proverb from the once prosperous commercial Saida district in Lebanon com pares unfavorably the task of the merchant to that of the astrologist, only to conclude that in trade not everything could be foreseen because of the risk factor : « Commerçant et astrologue, cela ne se peut pas ! Dans le commerce il y aun risque: on ne peut tout prévoir» (Abela 1981,395). 2 Braudel holds a distinction between the market economy, and the higher zone of capital ism. Whereas within the transparency of the first, that is the traditional domain of demand supply analysis, homo œconomicus reigns supreme, within the opacity of the second, entrepre neurs motivated by monopoly profits in a world of risk and uncertainty remain uncontested. 3 Writing in the last decade of the nineteenth century, Sutcliffe 1896, 827 observed: «A favoured section of the Guild of the Caidjees were the Soujee, or Water-Carriers, picturesque remnants of whom still haunt the squares of Stamboul. Clad in snowy linen, with bronzed limbs bare, hogskins full of the prized beverage on their backs, and branches of green leaves,</page><page sequence="20">28 Eyiip Ôzveren Little, if any, capital1 was deployed in this type of undertaking but with the utmost mobilization of individual as well as household labour. Market entry could practically not be controlled. Hence there existed almost full capital and labour mobility among trades. Furthermore, far from being territorially fixed, the street-vendors were highly mobile within the city limits. On the whole, while they could easily shift from one location or merchandise to another as circumstances dictated, the street-vendors were highly specialized as street-vendors within this par ticular underworld. It is logical to conclude that street-vendors were generally on the margin of proletarianization, and as such strived hard to survive. This struggle for survival naturally made them rather com petitive: Street vendors fill the air with their plaintive but not unmusical cries. Baskets of peaches, melons and cucumbers ... jostle trays of green walnuts, unroasted peanuts or roasted pumpkin seeds, or respectfully make way for perambulating tubs of ice cream that swing from a yoke on the shoulders of the most cavernous-lunged man in the crowd. Each class of edibles is presented by the man whose inventive genius has discovered the particular phrase most likely to arouse desire in all hearers to partake of the proffered viands. (Dwight 1901,174-175) A comparison of the genetically static attitude of shopkeepers with that of the energetic and innovative street-vendors who relied exclu sively on their trade for their livelihood could hence further indicate the underlying material factors listed above as responsible for the be havioural difference of shopkeepers. Last but not least, how could Islam as a religion be equated with the institutional setup and thus forced to explain the peculiarity of the static shopkeepers, when it was also the common religion of many long-distance merchants and street vendors, the conduct of whom defied generic European expectations built upon the model of 'economic man'? 5. Context Comes First In the light of the above arguments, we ought to step back from the predominantly anthropomorphic perspective characteristic of the nineteenth century. Furthermore, we ought to subscribe to the view that the social and economic organization in effect in the nineteenth century Levant determined the overall conduct of mercantile agents rather than the other way around. To exemplify, if some merchants did not behave as rivalry-oriented as expected, that may have been because sign of their calling, nodding above their handsome heads, they chant out, as the sway on wards, the words, 'Saook sonee Booz gibbee' (fresh water, cold as ice)». 1 Hamsun 1993, 58 observed in 1899 how many Jews who carried their 'shops' on their back engaged in shoe repair work in the streets of Istanbul.</page><page sequence="21">The Advent of homo œconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 29 of the lack of competition within the very context in which they oper ated. Farley (1866, 246-247) described how the famous merchants of Izmir envied for their access to European markets were in fact far from understanding the mechanism of competition and the dependence of their fortunes upon demand conditions that hinged upon technical in novations elsewhere: For example, it is to the value of the alkaloid morphia in the Smyrna opium that drug owes its high market value ; and it is to the high percentage of tannin in her valonia, and of colouring matter in her madder roots, that these articles owe their preferential position in foreign estimation. It is obvious that a single discovery in applied chemistry, which may be hourly made in any of the thousands of laborato ries in Western Europe or America, might have the effect of reducing the value of one or all of these articles just enumerated - an event which would most seriously disturb the equanimity of the merchant princes of Smyrna, who have not as yet seri ously learned the meaning of the word competition. An equally plausible explanation could be identified in the role attrib uted to professional solidarity within the setup of guilds and corpora tions. As one eyewitness observed in the late nineteenth century: The subject of the Guilds cannot be concluded without a reference to the wonder ful generosity shown by the guildsmen - and every Turk was a guildsman in time gone by - to their poorer fellow-craftsmen. .. .Freemasons themselves, kindly as they often are, stand nowhere in this respect compared to these oriental communities. The booth of a barber in small circumstances catches fire. Straightway his guild con structs it afresh. The grinder's badly-built mill falls about his ears. At once the wood merchant receives an order to raise him another at the expense of the guild. .. .Should protracted ill-luck follow any man, it is considered no disgrace that he should accept an order from either the general fund or some wealthy brother, which makes him free of a khan, where corn and oil, sleeping-mat and narghileh, are supplied. (Sutcliffe 1896, 827) Essentially, the tripartite division of mercantile activities is an intellec tual device designed to identify the existing types of market rationality. However, the zone of interaction between these categories should not be overlooked. It was along this frontier that institutionally innovative forms that brought together long-distance trade with small-scale ped dling flourished. In the light of this fact the symbiosis of seemingly dif ferent rationalities and modes of conduct can be better identified.1 The very survival of archaic practices of long-distance trade that were designed to take advantage of high profits based on market-dif ferentials in a terrain as large as that of the Levant commands our at tention. As long as the possibility of making high profits by way of extensive trade remained, there would be little incentive to concentrate 1 The exemplary work of Steensgaard 1973 depicts the institutionally innovative interaction of European trading companies and peddlers within the context of nascent markets without re course to religious explanations.</page><page sequence="22">30 Eyiip Ôzveren in the intensive exploitation of a highly specialized trade as was the case with shopkeeping. This may help explain the flow of capital and profit-motivated entrepreneurial skills to one kind of activity rather than the other. Above all, the Ottoman Empire was then particularly distinguished by the absence of a civil society that serves as the cor ollary for the genesis of the kind of conduct attributed to homo œco nomicus within the setting of a self-regulating market mechanism in the Polanyi-esque sense. The unmaking of the social embeddedness of the economy, and the subjugation of the struggle for livelihood to the principle of profit-making within the context of a self-regulating mar ket mechanism belong to a particular period of human history, namely the so-called modern times (Polanyi 1957). The uncritical generalizing of this particularism of modernity to all times and places brings with it the inevitable search for ahistorical motives as characteristic of the homo œconomicus. It is indeed high time for scholarship to venture into historically and spatially specific market forms and practices in conjunction with their corresponding mentalities, the impressionistic details of which can equally well be reclaimed from travelogues.1 We have already seen above the 'Frankish' shops in the Grand Bazaar of Istanbul designed exclusively for the foreign visitors. The Europeans were guided into these shops by enthusiastic 'voluntary escorts' who professed that all they wished was to prevent them from being cheated: About a hundred feet from the main entrance there lie in ambush like so many cutthroats the agents or middlemen of the merchants and the agents of the agents. These fellows are so well up in their business that at a single glance they learn not only that this is your first visit to the bazâr [bazaar], but usually make so clever a guess as to your nationality that they make a mistake in the language they first ad dress you in. . . (de Amicis 1896,1,127) In a similar vein, Wortabet's description of the role of the broker as an intermediary between the merchant and the shopkeeper as observed in the mercantile port-city of Beirut deserves our attention. It is as if the broker monopolizes for himself the central role of activating seeming ly less mobile partners. To achieve this end, the broker makes his way through a highly dramatized and ritualized bargaining practice. By so doing, the broker helps bring about a converging market process: Having come near to the point the broker drags the shopkeeper to the merchant, and nolens volens, links their hands in each other's grasp ; he at the same time, hold ing their hands within his own, lest they should be separated, in which case the sale is supposed not to be legal. He now calls upon the merchant to make the sale, or in 1 J. E. Kay's description of the lively fruit-market in Izmir, where a high volume of trade was conducted, includes the mechanisms of regular and periodic provisioning (1833, 491-492).</page><page sequence="23">The Advent of homo ceconomicus in the Representations of the Levant 31 Arabic, «to make the sale a blessing to the purchaser, at twenty piastres the piece.» «No!» grunts the merchant. He wants twenty-one piastres, and draws his hand back in token that he will not sell at that price. The ever ready broker joins them again, whispers something to both, and finally screams aloud, «Cut the difference, and let the price be twenty piastres and a half. » This being agreed to, the broker again calls upon the merchant to make the sale. This he does in this wise: while the hands of the merchant and shopkeeper are grasped the broker utters the finale, «ala una;» here he stops to breathe, «ala due;» here he coughs, «ala tre;» here he stops, and the sale is made by a silent but hearty shake of the hand between merchant and shopkeeper, which means, «I have sold,» and «I have bought». (Wortabet 1856,1, 38) Another example indicates how a native trader of Beirut, with utmost flexibility in a 'business-like way', assumed the task of intermediation and turned himself into a self-made auctioneer: Looking fiercely at those who did not bid, his whole soul seemed intent on the sale of the goods before him. He was mounted on the empty trough of the pump, so as to obtain a clearer view of passers-by; and drawing from his waistband a deadly looking weapon, something between a carving-knife and a dagger, he struck about with it in the most frantic manner, making imaginary stabs and thrusts in every direction. Meanwhile, he bellowed out the Arabic word, «Harage, harage, harage!» and when he had collected a sufficient number of people, he stopped flourishing the knife, and stooping down, cut the cordage that bound the goods together. He then seized the end of a piece of chintz in his left hand, and flung the rest adroitly over the heads of the mob, so as to display its whole length, and allow them to judge of its breadth and quality. The bidding instantly commenced at a ridiculously low figure, and whilst it proceeded, some few examined the articles more closely. Many a hard tussle ensued between the auctioneer and a very resolute bidder, and at last, each seized the chintz, and tried to gain forcible possession of it. . . In a short time everything was sold - some at a less, some at a higher alue. The money was gath ered, the knife sheathed, and the crowd dispersed, leaving the auctioneer to depart at his leisure. (Neale 1851,1, 234-235) In the memoirs of a Hungarian Orientalist visiting Anatolia in early twentieth century, one finds an equally interesting description of a marketplace practice noted as quite typical in Ankara as well as in the East in general (Horvath 1996, 112-113). According to this custom, one would entrust one's property for sale to an energetic tellal (an itiner ant auctioneer), who would go around the marketplace negotiating the price. Hence without a shop, that is, without a high fixed cost, a tellal could match the best potential buyer with the seller in question. From the viewpoint of the seller, but with a small commission, one could pass over the task of searching for customers and negotiating price and thereby still take advantage of the marketplace with utmost flexibil ity by recourse to a mobile intermediary whose occupation it was to match a buyer with the seller. Simple yet innovative institutional forms as depicted above that re</page><page sequence="24">32 Eyüp Ôzveren fleet the business motivation of the indigenous population require as much attention as the passing vignettes of the remote shopkeepers long deposited in the now dusty pages of travelogues. They will pro vide a convenient point of departure for shifting back the emphasis from agency behaviour to the characteristics of the institutional setup that prevailed at the levels of meso and macro structures. Just as in stitutional economics had originally developed by dissenting from the universalizing behavioural assumptions of mainstream economics, an institutional economic approach to this kind of historical evidence has much to gain from distancing itself from the behavioural assumptions in the sources it has to work with. Beyond this practical consequence, there will be a more important broader implication of this kind of a disciplinary reorientation. By ridding ourselves of such pervasive cul tural prejudices, we will come to see ourselves more and more not only as heirs to, but also as contemporaries of the great humanist Goethe.
