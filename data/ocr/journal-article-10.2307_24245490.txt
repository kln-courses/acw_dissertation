Geneva: Librairie Droz, 2008. 312 pp. ISBN 978-2-600-01245-4. Reviewed by: Pedro F. Campa, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga The popularity of Montaigne has produced a steady flow of studies both traditional (St. John, Frame) and revisionist (Almquist, Hoffman, Balsamo, Bakewell) about the authors life and works, but there are few serious in-depth studies about religion in Montaigne's works. Dieu à nostre commerce et société addresses this topic extensively. The book com piles the final versions of nineteen papers in French, with an introduction by Philippe Desan delivered at the international colloquium, Montaigne théologien?, held at University of Chicago Center in Paris on 30-31 March 2007. The articles are arranged into three sec tions. The first section, "Theology and Theologians," contains seven articles that deal with Montaigne's ideas of religion in the Essays. The second section, "Sebond and Natural Theol ogy," in five articles, centers around the fifteenth-century Catalan theologian and philoso pher Raimond de Sabunde (fl. 1434-36), whose Theologia naturalis (ca. 1431) Montaigne translated into French. In the third section, "Religious and Textual Practices," seven articles explore Montaigne's ambiguous attitudes toward ritual and devotion. Notable in the first section are the articles of Frédéric Brahami ("Théologie, religion, vérité chez Montaigne") and Vincent Carraud ("Avoir l'âme nette: Scepticisme et rigorisme dans Des prières"). Brahami focuses on Montaigne's ideas on the existence of God, proven by effects rather than by cause. Following Montaigne, human ideas about the deity are false and pos sibly blasphemous; hence natural theology is a form of anthropomorphism since divine power cannot be limited, or expressed, by our words (42). According to Brahami the osten sible dichotomy, observed by Montaigne, between Christian practice and doctrine is that the effectiveness of truth can only be realized by faith as the gift of grace. Although reason serves to embellish, to understand, and to amplify the truth of faith, it can never validate it. In Carraud's article about skepticism and rigor in Montaigne's essay on prayer, the critic explains that Roman censorship considered Montaigne's notions on the efficacy of prayer dangerously close to Erasmian and Protestant ideas. Carraud contends that for</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 559 Montaigne prayer that is not accompanied by the spirit of penitence and repentance would be as ineffective as prayer that seeks the accomplishment of an illicit act. In Montaigne's rigor, "as we forgive our debtors" in the Lord's Prayer is a serious quest for forgiveness that places prayer outside the realm of superstition and incantation. The five essays dealing with Montaigne and Sabonde explore the Catalan theologian's influence on Montaigne's ideas on religion. Sabonde's Theologia naturalis (ca. 1431), whose prologue was condemned by the Council of Trent, was an anthropocentric attempt to con ciliate faith and reason through the contemplation of nature that presumably contains the fundamental truth of scripture. Montaigne's interest in Sabonde renders his translation and one of his Essays (2.12) fundamental for the understanding of Montaigne's beliefs. In the third section of the book, "Pratiques religieuses et pratiques de textes," seven articles deal with different topics. Among the most interesting are Amy Graves's "Mon taigne et la géographie confessionelle" that examines Montaigne's cultural observations of religious practices in his Travel Journal; Jean Céard's article on Juan Luis Vives's annota tions of Augustine's City of God and Montaigne's readings, and Jean-Robert Armogathe's article on Julian the Apostate, Montaigne, and Roman censorship. Although this is a volume dedicated to a specialized readership, it is a meaningful addition to Montaigne's extensive bibliography. The complete set of essays accomplishes the elusive task of giving a multifaceted presentation of Montaigne ideas on theology, beliefs, and religious practices that will prove useful to Renaissance scholars.</page></plain_text>
