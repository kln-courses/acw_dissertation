The project described demonstrates  how PBL can be used to tap into college-level students’ natural curiosity about the  ancient world while training them to use practical, broadly applicable writing and  research skills.       W hen I was offered a temporary adjunct teaching position at a small liberal arts school, I jumped at the chance to design a course in my specialty from scratch. My assignment for  the 4-week term was to prepare a “sexy” (i.e. student-appealing)  class on Aegean prehistory as a counterpart to a course on Homer  and the Bronze Age offered earlier. With an alluring title and a com- pelling description for the catalogue, the only challenge that re- mained was to create a class on prehistoric archaeology that would  appeal to a largely freshman audience of non-Classics majors. At the  time, I was also participating in a program meant to groom young  academics to be thoughtful, scholarly instructors, in which we were  introduced to a teaching strategy called problem-based learning, or  PBL. PBL is a pedagogical methodology in which students focus on  solving problems or completing problem-based projects that simu- late real-world situations, and are asked to seek solutions to prob- lems that replicate real-world issues in a process that transforms  students into active learners, and instructors into learned guides.  PBL as an educational strategy originated at medical schools  in Canada and the United States as a way to train young physicians  to use knowledge acquired through self-motivated study to solve  patient problems.1 Since its development, the use of PBL has  branched out into other areas of the sciences, as well as into law, so- cial work and administrative training, but has been slow to permeate  the humanities.2 Positive results from the use of PBL strategies in the    * Appendices and scenarios are posted at http://classicaljournal.org/forum.php  1 Savin-Baden and Major (2004) 17–19, 22 n. 1.  2 Bridges (1992) focuses on the use of PBL for educational administrators; Savin- Baden and Major (2004) 19–22 list several programs that have implemented the PBL  method, noting that European educational systems have been at the forefront of ap- plying PBL in humanities courses. Constantino (2002) portrays a unique example of  the use of PBL in an American institution as part of an Art History program.

KVAPIL  sciences suggests that a problem-centered approach might be an ex- citing way to show how Classics courses can teach practical skills  valuable to high school and college students preparing for a broad  range of professions. It is with this in mind that I present the project  from my 4-week course, which was conceived during a brainstorm- ing session that explored ways PBL might be applicable to any field  of studies, even Aegean prehistory.  There are myriad benefits for students participating in PBL- oriented courses. Because the problems posed are supposed to be  unstructured and messy, with no single correct approach or solution,  a wide variety of skills must be applied to the problem-solving proc- ess. Newly acquired knowledge that is actively used is more likely to  be stored in students’ long-term memory. In a classroom environ- ment where inquiry and risk-taking are promoted,3 students seek  solutions by utilizing known resources and become naturally proac- tive in acquiring new information. Instructors facilitate the process  by providing wisdom and experience. Memorization by rote is  deemphasized. The center of learning thus shifts away from the lec- tern, and the classroom becomes a student-centered environment.  Proponents of the method note that students involved in classes em- ploying problem-stimulated strategies are more likely to participate  actively, interact more with their peers and use higher-level thinking  skills than students in lecture-based courses.  Entire classes are often constructed around the PBL strategy, but  I chose to start small, by exchanging the standard final exam and/or  final paper for a PBL project to be completed in stages over the  course of the four weeks. My aim was to emphasize the pragmatics  of archaeology, the research and planning that happen before and  after work in the field. The first step was to create a context simulat- ing this practical side of archaeology, in which the students would  assume the roles of scholars. The two primary skills I wanted my  students to exercise were research and persuasive writing, skills that  are marketable to a number of professions. The idea developed into a  grant-writing project requiring teams of students to apply for fund- ing to study prehistoric material culture in Greece. Information  about prehistoric Aegean cultures disseminated though lectures and  other classroom activities could be constructively applied to their  proposals and serve as a starting point for deeper research. The team  aspect would mimic the collaborative nature of archaeological pro- jects and foster teamwork skills.  There are some drawbacks to the implementation of PBL pro- jects. One is the amount of preparation required to carry them out  successfully. In this case, scenarios had to be devised and portfolios    3 See Barell (2007) 11–26 for suggestions on how instructors can create a safe en- vironment for PBL and both stimulate and model inquisitive behavior.  </page> <page sequence="3">  TEACHING PRAGMATISM 47  of material assembled and tailored to each group. Precise guidelines  for the completion of the projects and rubrics for assessment also had  to be constructed prior to the beginning of the class. This was time- consuming, but preparing these materials in advance freed me up  during the term to communicate better with students—and even to  do my own research. The advance construction of a rigid project  framework including precise guidelines and staggered deadlines  gave students the chance to practice time management and the effi- cient use of labor and materials. Trading broad familiarity with a  subject for an in-depth understanding of a specific topic can also be  seen as a drawback. On the other hand, one could argue that the  widely applicable research, reasoning and writing skills exercised in  completing the assignment are a fair exchange for blanket knowl- edge that might not be applicable beyond one particular course.  Changing from a disseminator of knowledge to a facilitator for  thinking and learning was a challenging adjustment for me. Much of  this change means providing a solid structure in which students can  work through the problem-solving process. As a guide to the proc- ess, an instructor must set time constraints on group activities that  determine the pace of the class, and keep students on task, forcing  them to prioritize goals and making them accountable for complet- ing them. As a knowledgeable tutor, the instructor can use personal  experience to field inquiries and offer advice. As a facilitator, he or  she must ensure that groups operate smoothly, by assisting them in  setting appropriate, manageable goals; offering support and encour- agement; fostering productive relationships within groups; and  maintaining a non-threatening environment.4   In the months before the class began, I devised three hypotheti- cal scenarios, each addressing a real-world archaeological problem:  the publication of material before continued excavation; the necessity  of studying looted sites; and the justification of excavation based on  survey data. The objective of the groups assigned to the first scenario  was to apply for funding to study unpublished material from a Neo- lithic site in northern Greece. The second scenario required groups to  apply for a grant to research looted Mycenaean chamber tombs,  while the third scenario called for them to request permission to ex- cavate sites discovered during a surface survey on Crete. The stu- dents’ aim was to construct a research design that would persuade a  committee to fund or approve projects that showed a thorough and  well-presented knowledge of the material and demonstrated how  the research would change the general understanding of Aegean  prehistory.   Three groups of three to four students apiece were assigned to  the scenarios, each of which had three required components.

KVAPIL  first was the written grant proposal or request to excavate, including  a bibliography of all sources consulted. Then, a budget outlining the  group’s estimated expenses was necessary; this served to encourage  students to consider financial and other practicalities of carrying out  the proposed research. The final part of the project was an oral pres- entation, during which each group explained its objects, sites, re- search proposal and budget to the rest of the class. In addition, a  portfolio of background information was distributed to each group.  Below are the description and background particulars from the first  scenario:    Description    Dr. X has been excavating the Neolithic site of Meze Magoula in North- ern Greece for the past several years with a permit from the Greek govern- ment. However, a law passed in November 2007 by the Greek Ministry of  Culture requires that, in order for her permit to be renewed, Dr. X must fully  publish all her excavated material. Dr. X has also learned that the Institute of  Aegean Prehistory, her primary source of funding, will not renew her exca- vation funding if she loses her permit. While she has published preliminary  excavation reports for every dig season, she has not had time to study and  publish several bodies of material that require special attention.    You have worked with Dr. X at Meze Magoula for the past two sum- mers, and she has asked you to help her publish a burial found in one of the  rooms on the site. But because her funding has been cut until her publica- tions are up-to-date, your group must apply for outside grants to study the  material in Greece. Your goal is to write a competitive grant application that  outlines your unique approach to this material and places it in the perspec- tive of the rest of the site and the Neolithic period.    Background    Meze Magoula is a mound site located in the Thessalian Plain in North- eastern Greece. According to the stratigraphy and the finds, the site was  occupied from the Early Neolithic to the Final Neolithic period, after which  it was abandoned. When the mound was excavated, archaeologists uncov- ered a village made of close-packed rectangular houses and open courtyards  (lower case “c” on the plan) surrounded by a wide circuit wall. The house- walls and the circuit wall were made of mud brick. The mound was formed  as the inhabitants continually built new mudbrick houses over the ruins of  older ones. The buildings that were best preserved, those that are shown in  the plan, are from the Late Neolithic period.    During the excavation of Room A (see site plan), a human burial was  discovered. The individuals had been contracted and deposited in a storage  pit beneath the floor of the room. On the floor above the pit burial were scat- tered seeds, a cup and a sherd. No grave goods were included in the burial.  So far, no work beyond excavation has been done on this material. It is still  unknown, for example, how many individuals were buried, how they died  or how they lived. Neither the pottery nor the seeds have been analyzed.    </page> <page sequence="5">  TEACHING PRAGMATISM 49  Fellowship    The Northern Greece Fellowship in Neolithic Studies is a grant of $5000  toward the study and publication of Neolithic material from Northern  Greece.    The scenarios were wholly hypothetical. Meze Magoula is a  made-up site, and the Greek government has not passed a law re- garding the publication of excavation materials. Still, specificity,  even in invented details, is a key element for simulating reality. The  photographs of objects from the supposed site that were incorpo- rated into the portfolios were specific to the period covered in the  scenario, but represented a pastiche of previously published material  from a number of sites. A site plan and mock notebook pages record- ing the discovery of the objects and preliminary observations were  also included. The finds were intended to be reminiscent of material  culture made familiar to students through textbook readings, class- room lectures and discussions, but were not meant to be immedi- ately identifiable. I was careful to choose objects from a variety of  places so that students would be unlikely to discover the original  publications and develop a biased view of the finds. In the end, the  scenario was detailed enough to convince them to play along.  The portfolios were rich in clues intended to stimulate the inves- tigations and place students in the role of real archaeologists who  must justify their project to a mixed audience of specialists and non- specialists. Situations in which scholars are asked to study material  and provide their own funding are common, and researchers work- ing on the same project must sometimes even compete for support.  The problem for each group was thus not only to make a convincing  argument that their research was important enough to be funded,  but to persuade the committee that they were the only group that  deserved the fellowship.  During the first meeting, students were divided into groups  based on criteria such as major and levels of experience. The groups  were then assigned their scenarios by lot. After each group was  given its portfolio of material, the students’ first task was to ask two  questions. What did they know, and what did they need to learn?  These questions helped provide a framework for their proposals, by  initiating a process of inquiry. The process also gave them a chance  to survey the pool of knowledge within the group.5 This exercise  should ideally be repeated several times over the course of the pro- ject, so that groups can reassess their data and refocus their goals as  they learn more about the subject matter.     5 Amador, Miles and Peters (2006) 79–81.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 50 LYNNE A. KVAPIL  Facilitating learning, as opposed to relying solely on traditional  instruction, was challenging, considering the short time frame of the  course and the subject matter, which was entirely unfamiliar to the  students. During one in-class activity, each group was required to  write an exhaustive description of one assigned object, while keep- ing a list of missing data that could only be acquired by studying the  piece first-hand. The follow-up exercise was to propose possible  interpretations based on the descriptions paired with classroom- acquired knowledge of prehistoric cultures and the basics of archae- ological theory. This was an ideal arena to practice guiding students  toward constructive means of approaching their materials. One  group, for example, initially interpreted an anthropomorphic ceramic  figurine with preserved painted lines as primarily the product of  religious practices. The figure was seated and held a smaller, form- less figure in its arms. Rather than writing an objective description of  what they saw, the group described the object as a female figurine  holding a child and as a votive offering to a mother goddess. The  painted decoration was interpreted as the outlines of female genita- lia, emphasizing the figurine’s fertility. Assumptions made without  exploring alternative options led to overly-broad cultural generaliza- tions. It was hard to watch the group head down this path, and chal- lenging to find a way to steer them away from a simplistic answer  without telling them outright to consider multiple interpretations. I  questioned them about their choices. How did they know the figu- rine was a woman? What about it was religious? If the figurine rep- resented a male, how might that change their interpretation? The  leading questions compelled the students to explain and reexamine  the reasons for their choices, but did not necessarily change their  assessment—which turned out to be a fatal flaw in their final pro- posal. The situation emphasized that problem-solving exercises must  be balanced with lectures and readings rich in background informa- tion, especially in the case of an introductory class, as opposed to a  graduate seminar in which advance knowledge of the topic is re- quired.  The final products of the project were assessed by both the stu- dents and myself. I wrote rubrics for evaluating the written propos- als (which I assessed) and the oral presentations (which the students  assessed).6 I gave the students the rubrics for the written proposals  and oral presentations in advance, so that the criteria being evalu- ated would be explicit, and so that they could fine-tune their pro- posals and presentations accordingly. Peer assessment and com- petition increased their motivation to produce high-quality products.    6 The rubrics are reproduced in Appendices B and C (see initial note above). A  number of helpful websites are devoted to the subject of rubric design. Barell (2007)  152–64 also provides additional suggestions on various modes of assessment.  </page> <page sequence="7">  TEACHING PRAGMATISM 51  The completed final projects showcased the creativity of the class  in their use of resources and range of inquiry. Because few institu- tions are equipped to support in-depth research projects on Aegean  prehistory, the students mined the library for useful resources, be- came familiar with sites such as JSTOR and discovered other useful  online resources. The questions they addressed ranged from prob- lems of chronology, to daily diet, to craft and agricultural produc- tion. Budgets set aside funds for activities such as radiocarbon  dating of seeds, calipers for measuring bones and sherds, and even  hiring specialists. The groups competing for excavation funds budg- eted for equipment including picks, trowels and shovels, as well as  hotel rooms and meals for a team of researchers and diggers. Some  groups cut costs by choosing to camp, setting aside money for tents  and sleeping bags instead of booking hotels. Each item on the budget  was carefully researched so that the most economical choices could  be made.  On the days set aside for the presentations, students who were  not presenting assumed the role of the committee and were asked to  decide which projects deserved to be funded. Only one project per  scenario could be chosen. The students took their job seriously, rating  each group according to criteria such as organization, knowledge,  division of labor and professionalism. After all the presentations for  each scenario were complete, the students who had presented left  the room, while the rest of the class debated which group should be  awarded the grant. I did not actively participate in these surprisingly  intense discussions, but instead guided the discussion and helped  organize thoughts and opinions so that a fair and timely decision  could be reached.   Facilitating these discussions was one of the most rewarding ex- periences of the class. The students meticulously analyzed each as- pect of the proposals to ensure feasibility, asking for clarification of  details from the written proposals and closely examining budgets. A  lengthy argument arose when students debated whether radiocar- bon dating proposed by one group was applicable to the material to  be tested. In this case, the possible misapplication of scientific testing  disqualified the group from receiving funding, despite their other- wise strong and well-presented argument. Although I was forced to  witness an occasional misstep, it was gratifying to watch the stu- dents apply their newly acquired knowledge of prehistoric cultures,  archaeological procedures and grant-writing skills, all learned dur- ing the course of their own research, to assessing their peers.  The hard work the students displayed in completing the project  and the generally positive assessment of their peers assured me that  the experiment in PBL had been successful. Still, it was by no means  perfect. Upon reflection, I realized that pre-assigning permanent  </page> <page sequence="8"> 52 LYNNE A. KVAPIL  roles such as leader, discussion facilitator and liaison for sharing in- formation and resources with other groups in the same scenarios  would have given the groups a sturdier structure. Asking students  to create and assign their own roles within the group was overly  difficult for those new to intensive group work. If roles are pre- assigned, the groups should be responsible for writing job descrip- tions, in order to ensure that the responsibilities for each position are  realistic. A revised version of the project would also include more  opportunities for reflexive assessment. Regular debriefing sessions  provide a forum for instructors to solicit immediate, candid critiques  of their performance and the project’s procedure, while giving stu- dents the opportunity to evaluate their own participation and dis- cuss suggestions for changes or improvements to the class format.   I strongly recommend the PBL method to instructors of classical  languages and classical civilizations.7 My experience shows that the  method can be applied to introductory or advanced classes at vari- ous levels of intensity. PBL pushes students to apply knowledge and  skills to realistic problems, and challenges instructors to go beyond  their comfort zone, encouraging them to transform themselves from  disseminators of knowledge into guides in the learning process. The  result is to make the experience of the ancient world more meaning- ful and relevant to students and teachers in the modern world.    LYNNE A.
