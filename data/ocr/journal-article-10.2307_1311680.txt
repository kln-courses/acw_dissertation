Springer-Verlag, New York, 1991. 302 pp., illus. $59.00 (ISBN 0-387-97439-3). Ecology is being sold as a panacea to global problems, as a political and moral revolution, as a system of ab- stract mathematical equations, as a computer simulation, and as a long series of films for secondary school students with cute animals, pretty plants, and anthropomorphic com- mentary. These are centrifugal forces that threaten to destroy ecology as a science. Within academic ecology, the subdivisions continue until pollen ecologists cannot find words for root ecologists and neither cares much for foraging theorists, who know them- selves to be on the cutting edge. Con- currently, as popular concern for in- tellectual activity in general and unapplied science in particular dwin- dle, nasty squabbling is breaking out within universities over ever-more- inadequate financial support. The previous paragraph may be exaggerated, but there is enough truth in it to make J. H. Andrews' book particularly important right now. Its concerns are intellectual and its style is ebullient and nonhomiletic. It fo- cuses on living organisms-all living organisms-including the microbiota that, if they are considered at all, are usually lumped as "decomposers." The book is comparative, and be- cause its domain of comparisons is so diverse it is unifying. The result is exciting, organism-centered, and rich in information: lovely stuff to present to a first-year ecology class or even a freshman course that has room for ecology. I found refreshing approaches to many old problems, for example, an illumination of the ramet-genet dis- tinction. Andrews' focus is on orga- nisms whose genet consists of more- or-less independent modules. Classical ecological and evolutionary theory, from R. A. Fisher to just before J. Harper, focused on genets as the nat- ural unit. The standard diagrams of initial reproductive value against age show an increase followed by a rela- tively sharp decline immediately after the beginnings of reproduction. This basic shape was the starting point for endless theoretical speculations about aging, trade-offs, and life history. Fisher's notion of reproductive value pertains to genets. A clone of ramets is only one genet, so that reproductive value of a genet in its entirety need never decline! This example of how ecological and evolutionary rules must be refocused when microorga- nisms are taken seriously illustrates why this book is just the thing for those bored with the hoary controver- sies of current, but, as Andrews dem- onstrates, "premodern," ecology. No book is perfect. The tired old logistic equation, which I have been trying to make go away since 1954, pops up again (as if it helped) at the end of this book. There are other places in the text where I would have been happier had Andrews adopted a more critical attitude. Nevertheless, I strongly recommend this book. LAWRENCE B.
