<plain_text><page sequence="1">And Your Garments Purify: tahara in the Light of tafsir Shuruq Naguib LANCASTER UNIVERSITY Why examine notions of purity (tahara) in tafsir when conventional wisdom tells us to look in the books of fiqh? Considered 'polluted' by the idiosyncratic interests of individual classical exegetes, or deficient in its approach to Qur'anic themes, tafsir has been, so far, precluded from the study of tahara.1 The contention here is that because it contains a variety of exegetical opinions, methods and scholarly traditions, tafsir is more of an interdisciplinary genre than an enclosed discipline. Thus, a study of how Qur'anic notions of purity are represented in tafsir works can help us locate tahara within the larger religious discourse encompassing the various disciplines that have evolved from the responses of Muslims to the Qur'an alongside other authoritative texts. This being the task, tafsir is well suited as an entry point into different layers of religious discourse beyond the confines of juristic compendiums. The works to be examined below are all from the classical period. They include al Tabari (d. 310/922) through whom we can have a glimpse into formative interpretations of the Qur'an; al-Zamakhshari (d. 538/1144); al-Razi (d. 606/1209); al-Qurtubi (d. 671/1272) and Ibn Kathfr (d. 774/1371). The Qur'anic instance which will constitute the focus of discussion here is the command to perform or seek purification in Surat al-Muddaththir:2 O you wrapped up [in a mantle]. Arise and deliver [your warnings]. And your Lord magnify. And your garments purify (wa-thiyabak fa tahhir)(Q. 74:1-4). This is the only Qur'anic instance where there is a direct instruction to 'purify'3 - addressed to Prophet Muhammad, according to tafsir.4 In addition, it is one of the very early revelations of the Qur'an, if not the earliest - a contended point preoccupying a great deal of the exegetes' attention when dealing with Sura 74.5 This makes it all the more interesting to examine the meanings which exegetes attach to purification in this context, and the strategies they employ to define and maintain the boundaries of signification. 59</page><page sequence="2">60 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Multiple Meanings Although in the tafsir literature there is agreement that the addressee of these ayas is Prophet Muhammad, the divergence of opinions on the meaning of the divine command in this aya is substantial. Al-Tabari offers five possible interpretations, each supported by a set of exegetical reports from early authorities who focus their attention on explicating the meaning of the imperative form tahhir.6 Thus, the divine command to Prophet Muhammad to purify his garments could mean: (1) (to purify them) from sins, disobedience to God and treachery; (2) (to purify them) from being bought with unlawful gains; (3) to mend his actions; (4) to pay no heed to the accusations of sorcery and priesthood directed at him; or (5) to cleanse (his garments) with water. The first four interpretations reflect a general preference for a non-literal reading. Although al-Tabari does not classify them as such, he does concede that they do not represent the 'most literal' meanings of the aya. However, in support of these less literal interpretations, evidence is adduced from Arabic poetry where the expression 'purity of garments' signifies purity of moral character. (All later exegetes discussed in this article, will introduce similar poetic attestations with varying emphasis.) In the first interpretation, tahhir is explicated in the sense of purification from sins and transgressions against God (macsiya, ithm, dhunub). This reading is the most widely-supported by early exegetes including Ibn c Abbas (d. 68/687). Al-Tabari cites seventeen traditions, ten of which are variants of Ibn c Abbas's opinion reported by his students ?Tkrima and ''Ata3. The remaining seven, reported from their successors Qatada, Ibrahim al-Nakha% al-Dahhak and cAmir al-Shacbi, provide a similar or additional comment to Ibn 0Abbas' paraphrase. For example Qatada adds that, conversely, the expression 'defiled (danis) clothes' in poetic usage signifies moral depravity, maintaining that the cause of such defilement is the 'violation of the covenant' .7 The remaining non-literal readings in al-Tabari's exposition are presented with comparatively fewer advocates among the early exegetes. For example, the second interpretation of tahhir, in the sense of acquiring clothes with lawful gains, is attested by a single report from Ibn c Abbas. The third interpretation of the aya as an admonition to the Prophet to improve his actions, based on another idiomatic use of 'garments' to signify a person's deeds, is attributed to the companion Abu Razln and the early exegete Mujahid ibn Jabr (d. 105/723). The fourth interpretation, also attributed to Mujahid, reads your garments purify as a command to the Prophet not to be distressed by the accusations of Meccans that he is a priest or a sorcerer.8 All four interpretations, though varying in the degree of support attributed to them, converge in their focus on the theme of purity as avoidance of sin or of some kind of wrongdoing.</page><page sequence="3">tahara in the Light of tafsir 61 The fifth and final interpretation is described by al-Tabari as the most literal one (azharmacanlhi). The early jurist Muhammad ibn Slrin (d. 110/728) and the exegete Ibn Zayd (cAbd al-Rahman, d. 182/798) are cited as supporters of this literal reading of tahhir in the sense of cleansing with water, which Ibn Zayd further justifies by asserting that the Prophet was instructed to cleanse himself and his clothes with water so as to set him apart from the Meccan associators who did not purify themselves.9 Although al-Tabari considers this last interpretation the most literal, he does not express his preference for it, possibly because he perceives no contradiction between the most literal and the less literal readings of Q. 74:4. Hence, the boundaries of meaning need not be constricted in this case. Yet al-Tabari's organisation of material is not innocent; seventeen reports are cited in support of reading Q. 74:4 as your garments purify from sins, disobedience to God and treachery, and only two in support of reading it literally. Furthermore, this 'less literal' reading is significantly marked as 'the opinion of the majority of authorities among the pious ancestors'.10 The batin-mhir Continuum Al-Zamakhshari appears to concur with al-Tabari in perceiving no danger of contradiction between the literal and less literal readings of Q. 74:4. However, he gives precedence in his commentary to the literal interpretation, according to which Q. 74:4 could mean (1) a command to keep clothes (ritually) clean and pure from defilement, or (2) a (ritually-related) caution against the Arab custom of wearing lengthy gowns at the risk of contracting substantive impurities (najasat).11 Given that the purity of clothes is a condition for the soundness of prayers, al-Zamakhshari infers that it is preferable and desirable at all other times, and that bearing filth (khubth) is deplorable for a good believer. Notwithstanding this literal reading, he still permits a figurative (majaz)12 interpretation of your garments purify in the sense of avoiding loathsome and objectionable deeds or habits given the wide (metonymic) use in the Arabic idiom of purity or defilement of garments, or parts of garments to signify the morality or depravity of a person. To justify his acceptance of this figurative interpretation, al-Zamakhshari contends that the metonymy of garments is plausible due to the intimate contact between the garment and the person it encloses. In further defence of sustaining two diverging approaches to the aya, he offers a synthesis in which the literal and the figurative, the ritual and the moral are not dichotomised. Instead, they become fundamentally linked on a continuum from the inward to the outward:13 The one who purifies and cleanses his batin (inward aspect) would naturally purify and cleanse his zahir (outward aspect), and would avoid all filth and seek purity (tuhr) in everything.</page><page sequence="4">62 Journal of Qur'anic Studies The haqiqa-majdz Matrix Al-Razi elaborates al-Zamakhshari's majdz application into a complex matrix constituted of all probable combinations of literal (haqiqa) and figurative (majdz) applications of the two words 'garments' (thiyab) and 'purify' (tahhir). These combinations generate four interpretative possibilities, onto which he maps all standard and novel readings of Q. 74:4: (1) a literal reading of both words; (2) a literal reading of 'garments' combined with a figurative reading of 'purify'; (3) a figurative reading of 'garments' combined with a literal reading of 'purify'; and (4) a figurative reading of both words. The first interpretative possibility, which is an entirely literal reading of your garments purify, has already been represented by al-Tabari as the last and least supported position, and by al-Zamakhshari as the principal interpretation of Q. 74:4. In both exegetes, it is evident that this literal reading reflects juristic efforts to tie in this aya with the law of tahara as a Qur'anic proof text for certain ritual requirements. Al-Razi is evidently aware of this and mentions, by way of example, al-ShafiT's use of Q. 74:4 to attest a juristic ruling on the necessity of praying in pure clothes. Like al-Tabari, al-Razi also introduces Ibn Zayd as one of the earliest authorities keen on establishing the law of ritual purity as a very early concern of Qur'anic revelation, and a distinctive characteristic of Islam in contrast with the associators' laxity towards substantive impurities. He further corroborates Ibn Zayd's interpretation by an occasion of revelation report in which it is related that the Prophet was commanded to cleanse his garments from the impurities (najasat) of dead sheep organs thrown at him by Meccans.14 The second combination is where 'garments' is interpreted literally while 'purify' is interpreted figuratively to read Q. 74:4 as 'your garments shorten', (a reading previously listed by al-Zamakhshari). However, al-Razi is not content with restricting the meaning of the aya to a juristic precaution against long garments contracting substantive impurities as a result of contact with the ground. An ethicist as well as an exegete, al-Razi reads into this interpretation a moral caution against vanity, explaining that long-hemmed garments were worn by Arabs out of pride. Another figurative possibility for 'purify' is when it is read as an instruction to only wear garments purchased by lawful gains.15 The third combination, which is the converse of the second, is where 'garments' is interpreted figuratively while 'purify' is interpreted literally. In this case, according to al-Razi, 'garments' either signifies the human body or the human soul. If it is taken as a metaphor for the human body, the intended meaning is physical purification; that is the purification of the orifices of the body after elimination (istinja3) and the Prophet was instructed to perform this because the Arabs were negligent in this respect. Alternatively, if the word 'garments' stands for the human</page><page sequence="5">tahara in the Light of tafsir 63 soul, then the instruction refers to spiritual purification. Of significance here is that a figurative reading does not necessarily refer to an abstract or non-physical understanding of what purity is, a point to be later explored. The purification of 'garments', when this word is taken as a metaphor for the body or for the soul, is in both cases perceived and classified by al-Razi as haqiqa.16 Al-Razi pays the most attention to the fourth combination whereby 'purify' and 'garments' are both figuratively interpreted, legitimising it, like al-Tabari, as representative of the majority view on this aya. Yet of all the early opinions, al-Razi only adduces the support of al-Hasan al-Basri (d. 110/728) who interprets your garments purify in the sense of 'improve your moral character'. His exclusion of all the early explications of purity being from sins or transgressions, extensively cited in al-Tabari, is almost certainly due to his theological sensitivity towards any implication that the Prophet may have committed sins.17 Al-Basri's interpretation is itself further interpreted by al-Razi as having three aspects which he attributes to al-Qaffal,18 all drawing on the historical backcloth of one of the occasion of revelation reports associated with Surat al-Muddaththir.19 First, the command to the Prophet to purify his moral character is (a) a reprimand for his inappropriate distress when he is called a sorcerer by the unbelievers, (b) an order to dissociate himself from the depravity and deceitfulness of the unbelievers who lie and sever kinship ties, and (c) an instruction to resist his vengeful desires against those who hurt him. Al-Razi expresses his preference for al-Basri's figurative interpretation because it demonstrates the interconnectedness of the first few ayas of Surat al-Muddaththir. The thematic linkage could be achieved, on the one hand, by considering and your garments purify an allusion to the sura's opening reference to the Prophet's mantle in Q. 74:1, O you wrapped up [in a mantle]. Accordingly, the Prophet is admonished not to cloak himself in distress, anxiety and impatience at the scornful associators. On the other hand, the thematic linkage could be based on interpreting the mantle referred to in Q. 74:1 as an allusion to the burdens of prophethood; in view of this, al-Razi explains that the Prophet is instructed not to be deterred by the unbelievers' impertinence and to arise and deliver the duties of prophethood (Q. 74:2) and to 'purify' himself (Q. 74:4) from the distress, impatience and resentfulness unbecoming of a prophet.20 In addition to al-Basri's interpretation, al-Razi lists two later figurative readings of and your garments purify; first, as a command to the Prophet to avoid all the transgressions he committed prior to prophethood, a meaning justified by some exegetes in light of Q. 94:2, and removed from you your burden (wizrak), if 'burden' is taken to signify wrongdoings; and second, as a command to purify his wives, an interpretation attributed to the exegete and grammarian Ibn c Arafa al-Nahawi (d. 323/934) and evidenced in the Qur'anic description of men and women as one another's garments (libas) in Q. 2:187. Al-Razi is dismissive of this second majaz on</page><page sequence="6">64 Journal of Qur'anic Studies the basis that it is farfetched and severs Q. 74:4 from preceding ayas which, he asserts, are thematically connected if interpreted in light of their occasion of revelation.21 Regulating Multiplicity Like al-Razi, al-Qurtubi attempts to bring order to the multiple and accumulating exegetical readings of the divine command in Q. 74:4. However, when organising the different interpretations, he makes no direct use of the hermeneutic terminology of majdz and haqiqa, perhaps because he is suspicious that such free shifting of meaning across a matrix of figurative and literal possibilities is perilous to the coherence of the overall meaning in the aya. Instead, he pins down the word 'purify' to its literal sense of 'cleansing or perfecting' while variety is alternatively mapped onto the metonymical and literal possibilities of the word 'garments'.22 Still, the various metonymical possibilities of 'garments' necessitate at times further explication of 'purify'. As a metonym (kinaya) 'garments' could signify (1) actions, (2) heart, (3) soul, (4) body, (5) wives, (6) moral character and (7) religion. When 'garments' signify actions (1), 'purify' is interpreted as a command to perfect one's deeds.23 The idiomatic use of 'garments' to qualify someone's actions as good and pure (tahir) or bad and filthy (khabith), is for the first time substantiated by a Prophetic tradition which al-Qurtubi cites from cAli ibn Muhammad al-Mawardi (d. 450/1058) in addition to the standard poetic citations. The Prophet, in al Mawardi, is reported to have said: 'Man will come on the Day of Judgement clad in his two gowns (thawbayyhi) in which he died', meaning by 'the two gowns' his good and bad deeds.24 When 'garments' signify the heart (2), the soul (3), or the body (4), the desired purification is from sins and transgressions. Again, al-Qurtubi uses poetic citations attributed to Ibn c Abbas to prove that these metonymies are common in the Arabic language.25 The apparently later meaning of 'garments' as an allusion to wives (5), rejected as farfetched by al-Razi, is given further consideration. Citing al-Mawardi as his source, al-Qurtubi expounds the meaning of purification in terms of marrying chaste women believers, or avoiding sodomy or intercourse during menstruation with one's wife.26 The interpretation of 'garments' as a metonym for moral character (6) is attributed to al-Hasan al-Basri and Muhammad ibn Kacb al-Qurazi (d. 109/727) but is downplayed, presumably since it could imply that the Prophet Muhammad was admonished to purify his character from unbefitting qualities, which goes against al-Qurtubi's insistence that, in Q. 74:1-5, God addresses the Prophet in the second person to honour him. The last possible metonymy is when 'garments' is read as religion (7). If supporting evidence is any indication of the exegete's preference, it is obvious that al-Qurtubi</page><page sequence="7">tahara in the Light of tafsir 65 has a preference for this reading. He garners evidence from the Hadith collections of Muslim and al-Bukhari, where the Prophet is reported to have used the word 'garments' as an allusion to religious piety when he related to his companions a vision in which he saw people apparelled in clothes of different lengths, some hardly covering the upper part of their bodies, in which cUmar ibn al Khattab appeared cloaked in a lengthy mantle. According to hadlths, the Prophet interpreted the 'garments' as denoting a person's religion and/or religious piety.27 Al-Qurtubi further adduces the support of Malik ibn Anas (d. 179/795), founder figure of the MalikI school to which he belonged, who is said to have expressed his preference for reciting the Qur'an only during prayers or in mosques in compliance with God's command and your garments purify. Al-Qurtubi goes on to clarify that Malik understood 'garments' as a metonym for religion, and hence, the purification means the rigorous observance of one's personal ritual purity and that of the place where one recites the Qur'an. Besides Malik's specific application of the ay a, he is also reported to have explicated your garments purify in the sense of avoiding treachery, dishonesty or deceit,28 thus concurring with most early exegetes cited in al-Tabari - 29 and mentioned again in al-Qurtubi. In al-Qurtubfs analysis, and with supporting evidence from Malik and al-Qadi Ibn 30 al-cArabi, the aya ultimately signifies purification from all sins and transgressions. This brings us back to the first interpretative position in al-Tabari, upheld by the majority of the pious ancestors who read Q. 74:4 as an imperative to 'purify' oneself from sins and disobediences. Al-Qurtubfs typology, consisting of seven possible metonymies of the word 'garments', reflects variation produced within the boundaries of the ethical message consistently associated with the command and your garments purify since al-Tabari. It is also interesting to note that al-Qurtubi, an exegete with juristic concerns, does not give preference to a legal reading here. Moreover, he has no qualms about ascribing non-literal and non-juristic readings to Malik, and to Ibn al-cArabi, his predecessor in writing a legal commentary on the Qur'an. He even agrees with Ibn al-cArabi that the literal (haqiqa) and figurative (majaz) interpretations are not mutually exclusive, endorsing his opinion that both could be simultaneously intended by the aya.31 Finally exploring the literal readings of Q. 74:4, al-Qurtubi turns to the word 'purify'. Apart from his novel proposition that it is an instruction to dress elegantly, he tenders the recurrent readings of 'purify' as an instruction to keep clothes short, to wash them for ritual purposes or to obtain them from lawful and pure gains (min maksab tahir).32 Of note here is the total conflation between 'legal' and 'literal'. The two juristic readings he refers to in his discussion are classified as literal even though they do not reflect the immediate semantic content of the word 'purify' which has led other exegetes to classify them differently. For example 'purify' as a legal command to shorten clothes is considered figurative by al-Razi, and the command to</page><page sequence="8">66 Journal of Qur'anic Studies lawfully obtain clothes is considered non-literal by al-Tabari and al-Zamakhshari. In conclusion, al-Qurtubi maintains that the literal-juristic reading of 'purify your clothes from impurities with water' is an apparent and, hence, sound interpretation of Q. 74:4. Yet despite his view on the soundness of this literal meaning, he rejects al Shafici's application of the aya as a proof text for the obligation to pray in ritually pure clothes out of his allegiance to Maliki opposition to this legal opinion and Malik's preference for a non-literal interpretation of Q. 74:4 in the sense of purifying one's religion.33 Multiplicity Abbreviated Unlike his predecessors, Ibn Kathir appears uninterested in reorganising the different opinions of exegetes according to a hermeneutic matrix of haqiqa and majdz usages, as al-Razi does, or according to semantic or metonymic extensions of particular words in the aya, as al-Tabari and al-Qurtubi successively do. Although he renders a similar set of readings, he seems to be keener on neutralising this variety and on emphasising intersections by understating the difference in opinions and attaching several names of early authorities to a singular gloss or interpretation. For instance, Ibn Kathir cites the exegetical tradition which reports Ibn cAbbas' reading of and your garments purify as 'purify from sin' then appends to it his comment 'and so said Ibrahim al-Nakha3!, cAta3 and al-Shacbi'.34 Difference in the early exegetes' choice of terms and their points of emphasis is abbreviated on the basis that this variation is generated by synonymy, e.g. ithm, dhunub and macsiya. Other literal and non-literal opinions, all of which have already been mentioned, are considered by Ibn Kathir as meanings included in the semantic range of 'purify' and 'garments' - the two key terms in Q. 74:4. In his conclusion, Ibn Kathir concurs with his predecessors that the literal and non-literal readings could all be sustained by the aya without preferring one over the other: 'It is not necessary for it [the aya] to take on any one of those [meanings].'35 Moral and Ritual Purity: Observations on the Extension of Meaning The exegetical focus occasioned by this aya is, in the first place, an enquiry into the semantic and symbolic signification of purity regardless of which of the two keywords (thiyab and tahhir) is being considered. Apart from al-RazI's efforts to maintain intra-verse thematic connectedness by anchoring an interpretation of Q. 74:4 in the historical occasion of the first few ayas of the sura, the exegetes' discussion of the reference to purity in this aya is mainly linguistic, and often falls back on the idiomatic use of purity of garments to indicate moral purity in the Arabic language. On the formal level, the discussion generally operates according to a distinction between literal and non-literal strategies of interpretation, expressed in terms of majdz and haqiqa starting from al-Razi. On a less apparent level, there is a</page><page sequence="9">tahara in the Light of tafsir 67 corresponding distinction between interpretations with ethical and ritual imports - ritual here is used to connote legal applications in the Islamic tahara law. In al Tabari, there is full alignment between those two sets of distinctions whereby the ethical meaning extends from the less literal yet widely supported readings, whilst the ritual meaning extends from the most literal readings. The ethical meaning is further explicated, according to a considerable number of early authorities, in terms of moral purification from macsiya, ithm and dhanb. Underlying this extension is an exegetical perception of purity as an expression of obedience and compliance to God. Within these parameters, the 'pure' may also signify the lawful since it implies abiding by what God has stipulated. This explains the more specifically anchored readings of tahhir such as the instruction to 'obtain clothes by means of lawful gains' or 'avoid treacherous acts'. Such readings, which recur in every one of the five exegetes, are symbolic in themselves of the overlap between ethics and law in Islam. Al-Tabari's neat alignment between the literal/ritual and less literal/ethical is maintained by al-Zamakhshari who is explicit about his view that these interpretative possibilities are not mutually exclusive. Rather, the one becomes an extension of the other along a batin-zdhir continuum where moral purity finds its outward expression in physical purity. Al-Razi elaborates this duality of the literal and non-literal into a complex matrix where a literal interpretation is not necessarily focused on ritual matters (as in al-Tabari and al-Zamakhsharl) and vice versa, such as in the case when he classifies as figurative a reading of 'purify' in terms of an imperative to perform istinja3. In line with the established tradition and in contrast to his special interest in legal rulings of the Qur'an, al-Qurtubi does not favour a juristic reading, possibly because Malik is associated with a non-literal interpretation of the aya. The diverse readings of your garments purify which al-Qurtubi explores fundamentally represent a negation of sinfulness and disobedience. Ibn Kathir who, at times, comes across as a reductionist, is on this occasion sensitive to the intersections of meaning in the various readings which, perhaps, explains his tendency to abridge the semantic extensions of purification in Q. 74:4: one can see that his summaries of early opinions pinpoint the centrality of their ethical understanding of this aya. This ethical sense is upheld, throughout the exegetical tradition, as the primary sense of God's command to Prophet Muhammad to purify his garments (with the exception of al-Zamakhshari who gives precedence to the ritual readings).36 Despite this marked exegetical preference to read 'purify' in an ethical sense, there are noticeable efforts to reflect concerns of the law on the interpretation of Q. 74:4. In all of the five works of tafsir examined above, Muhammad ibn Sirin (d. 110/728) and Ibn Zayd (d. 182/798) are the earliest points of attribution for a juristic interest in Q. 74:4 in the sense of cleansing with water. It must be stressed, though, that these</page><page sequence="10">68 Journal of Qur'anic Studies 'most literal' interpretations, as al-Tabari classifies them, do not invest the aya with a specific legal requirement such as istinjd3. Al-Zamakhshari, on the other hand, unambiguously reads in it the requirement to observe the ritual purity of clothes from najdsdt. Al-Razi too attributes a more developed legal application of the aya to al-Shafi'i who, on account of it, ruled that ritually pure clothes are necessary for the validity of prayers. Notwithstanding these efforts, none of the exegetes single out a juristic reading as the preferred or only sense of the aya. Even more interesting is the fact that also none of them consider a ritual-related meaning to be exclusive of a general ethical reading. A case in point is al-Zamakhshari's synthesis of the outward and inward meanings whereby ritual purification is perceived as an outward expression of moral purification. A conflation of the two is also evident in al Qurtubi' s explication of Malik's views on Q. 74:4 as both signifying purity of religion in terms of devoted observance of ritual requirements for reciting the Qur'an as well as purity from lowly qualities and transgressions against what God has prohibited. This conflation clearly indicates a view of purification as an extended realm between moral and ritual meanings. Even in juristic interpretations which focus on the ritual implications of the aya, we can discern an interest that goes beyond the delineation of law. For example, reading the aya as a command to shorten garments to protect the hem from impurities acquires a further symbolic meaning when this instruction is justified as intended to contrast the observance of purity required in Islam with the unbelievers' laxity towards substantive impurities (Ibn Zayd), or the humility of the believers with the vanity of the unbelievers (al-Razi). In this way, ritual purity, as divine law, becomes symbolically extended to signify the religious identity and moral superiority of Islam. Hence, even in the case where the semantic explication appears to favour a ritual application of the aya, the ethical becomes re-inscribed at the symbolic level. Literal and Non-literal Purification: Reflections on the Exegetical Strategies As previously outlined, the ethical and the ritual readings of purity in Q. 74:4 correspond roughly to a hermeneutic distinction between literal and non-literal readings of the key terms in the aya. Starting from al-Zamakhshari, the non-literal is consistently designated as majdz, a term entangled with the theological controversies over metaphorical interpretations of the Qur'an which transfer its sense from reality to imagery. Yet, in the above discussion, the non-literal, including al-Razi's use of it, does not always involve transferring the meaning from the real to the imagined. To complicate matters further, in the above discussion it became evident that the relation between the literal (ritual) and the non-literal (ethical) appears more as a case of intersection than opposition. It is most likely that this is a result of the migration of the term majdz from one religious genre to another throughout its development. Historically, majdz was not</page><page sequence="11">tahara in the Light of tafsir 69 associated with metaphorical interpretation from the beginning. In Abu cUbayda's (d. 209/824-5) Majaz al-Qur3an, one of the earliest extant works which employ this term, we find a typology of permissible idiomatic violations of language conventions and their restitution. In this early use, the term majaz was tied up with philological efforts to establish the correspondence and, at times, the complete identification of the Qur'an with the language of the Arabs.37 It was used as a type of explanatory re writing of the idiomatic expression, the literal sense of which (its haqiqa) forms its sub-stratem and not its opposite. This early philological function persisted along with theological, legal and rhetorical applications that developed later.38 Majaz was also developed for theological purposes as a hermeneutic procedure of non-literal interpretation at the hands of kalam scholars, particularly the Muctazilis who employed it to 'purify' Islamic doctrine from all ambiguities arising from anthropomorphic references to the divine in the Qur'an. In this sense, majaz and haqiqa were formulated as a binary opposition. For example, a reference to God's hand is not intended to indicate a physical reality (haqiqa) but a quality that is mentally conceived through metaphor (majaz)?9 This type of raq/az-application was vehemently opposed by literalists such as the Zahiris and Hanballs who were keen on averting metaphorical interpretations which deployed the Qur'an in legitimising 'false' doctrines.40 However, at the hands of al-Rummani (d. 386/995) and cAbd al Qahir al-Jurjani (d. 471/1078), majaz became additionally rooted in the field of rhetoric as a generic term for elucidating and systematising types of linguistic metaphors and, from then on, it was associated with rhetorical interpretation concerned with the Qur'an's linguistic inimitability (icjaz). The layers of meanings and functions that the term majaz bears makes it difficult to discern straight away in which sense it is invoked in a particular case such as in the exegetical discussion of and your garments purify (Q. 74:4). Given that exegetes introduce this term without ever explicitly stating on which sense of majaz they are drawing, it is thus necessary to re-examine how it is applied case by case. The relevance of this, of course, is to determine the implications of their hermeneutic distinction between the literal and the non-literal for our understanding of the meaning of purification in this aya. Although al-Tabari does not use the term majaz in his commentary on Q. 74:4, he is undoubtedly aware of it and does, in fact, openly employ it elsewhere in his tafslr41 Yet while the term itself does not surface in connection with Q. 74:4, its philological function is evident in al-Tabari, who expends his efforts to prove the permissibility of interpreting your garments purify beyond the literal sense of cleansing with water on the basis of the wide use in the Arabic idiom of purity of garments to refer to purity from sins or immorality. In more than one report from Ibn 0Abbas and Qatada, we find this extension of Q. 74:4 justified with formulae like; '[as] in the speech of the Arabs' (fi kalam al-cArab); '[this is] an expression in the Arabic language that</page><page sequence="12">70 Journal of Qur'anic Studies Arabs used' (kalima min al-cArabiyya kanat al-cArab taqiiluha).42 When the case is one of identifying the Qur'an with the Arabic idiom, majdz, according to the early philologist, was applied as a mode of explanatory re-writing whereby the Qur'anic expression is supplemented with the idiomatic connotation. This, again, is apparent in the structure of the early reports which al-Tabari adduces in support of idiom based interpretations: 'your garments purify - that is from sins'. Even more significant is the fact that the moral understanding of purification in al Tabari, while not the most literal meaning of this Qur'anic reference (not azhar macanihi), it is still an extension of its literal (z.ahir) meaning. Thus, al-Tabari's distinction between most literal and less literal is not construed in terms of a relation of opposition between two hermeneutic strategies. Rather, the relation is one of extension from an original most immediate sense (the substratum) to a secondary one established through idiomatic use; in both cases the meaning is obvious and literal. This clarified, we can safely conclude that whether the aya is read as a command to purify garments with water, or to purify (oneself) from sins, the two readings are rooted in the linguistic reality of the term 'purify'. We can even go as far as asserting that, in view of al-Tabari's final summary of the less literal interpretations as agreeing that Q. 74:4 means 'purify your body from sins',43 the purification here is perceived to be real not only linguistically but physically too.44 Al-Zamakhshari, though initially underlining the juristic readings of Q. 74:4, subsequently approves of a non-literal interpretation which, in contradistinction to al-Tabari, he explicitly designates as the 'majdz' of the aya. As a Muctazili, he is the exegete most likely to be suspected of a theological application of majdz as a concept opposed to haqiqa and a strategy for transferring the sense of a Qur'anic expression from the literal, tangible and real to the figurative, intangible and derived meaning.45 The foremost aim of this transference in Muctazili exegesis is to prove that the literal meaning is actually not the true meaning of the Qur'an's anthropomorphic references to God. As such, the mq/az-based interpretation can neither be synthesised nor simultaneously maintained with a haqiqa-based interpretation, for this would be a self-defeating strategy. However, in consideration of al-Zamakhshari's actual use of it in his comment on Q. 74:4, we find that majdz here is employed differently. First of all, it does not appear in conjunction with the term haqiqa, and the distinction between literal and non-literal is implied in the term majdz alone. Secondly, al-Zamakhshari is surprisingly keen on the literal interpretation of purification in Q. 74:4, though still endorsing a figurative one which is attested, as in al-Tabari, by Arabic idiomatic use in standard and poetic language. Taking into account this reliance on idiomatic evidence to prove the possibility of a secondary meaning, we can confirm that al Zamakhshari is actually exploring a conventional use of metaphor and not applying theologically-oriented figurative interpretation. His distinction between literal and</page><page sequence="13">tahara in the Light of tafsir 71 non-literal here is therefore more akin to that of al-Tabari, whereby majaz is a secondary meaning extended from an original one. Al-Zamakhshari's figurative interpretation of purification is not just a case of semantic extension, though it evidently bears the stamp of this early philological use. It is more elaborate and indicative of its post-Jurjanian rhetorical application whereby a figure of speech {majaz) is analysed in terms of its contiguity with or similarity to the literal sense of its terms. This is exactly how al-Zamakhshari justifies a figurative interpretation of your garments purify - as signifying a person's morality or depravity 'because the garment is in close contact with the person and encloses him, it has become a metonym for him'.46 This use reflects what rhetoricians since al-Jurjani distinguish as a lexical metaphor (majaz lughawi), a category referring to a justified transference of the meaning of a single word to another that it did not originally denote.47 This clarifies why al-Zamakhshari is at ease when synthesising the literal and non-literal in terms of a continuum between zahir and batin. The reason is that majaz here operates purely at the level of language and not at the level of ontological reality. Hence, outward and inward purification may be perceived as ontologically linked. In contrast to al-Tabari and al-Zamakhshari, both al-Razi and al-Qurtubi overtly tap into the majaz-haqiqa terminological convention, recording an array of idiomatic and metaphorical explanations under majaz. On examining al-Razi's ordering of haqiqa and majaz readings, we find, at one end, the most immediate literal interpretation associated with the juristic reading of Q. 74:4 as 'cleansing clothes from substantive impurities'. However, not all juristic readings are considered literal by al-Razi. One such case is when he classifies the transference of 'purify' from the literal sense of 'cleansing' to the metaphorical sense of 'shortening clothes'. This is clearly not a case of a theological application of majaz but a case of transference from an original to an unconventional sense on the basis of a resemblance between the shortening of clothes to safeguard their purity and the literal sense of 'purify'. Here, the metaphor is acceptable because it fulfils what rhetoricians define as a relation of similarity.48 Moreover, in contrast to a theologically-oriented figurative interpretation, the metaphorical meaning 'to shorten' continues to signify the physical and the tangible.49 And even when a figurative interpretation such as 'purify your soul' indicates a transference of meaning to the intangible and non-physical realm of the spiritual because of a perceived contiguity, which al-Razi defines in terms replicated from al-Zamakhshari, he maintains that purification in this case signifies a haqiqa. This indicates that al-Razi is applying the lexical type of majaz that focuses on the use of single words beyond their original meaning (haqiqa). At the opposite end from the haqiqa reading, a completely figurative reading of your garments purify as 'improve your moral character' represents a double metaphor; 'purify' as improve and 'garments' as moral character. Of note here is the fact that</page><page sequence="14">72 Journal of Qur'anic Studies al-Razi does not attempt to justify these derived meanings as idiomatic extensions of the literal sense like his predecessors. Still, the transference of meaning from a literal to a figurative one has to be rationally justified. In this case, al-Razi substitutes the total severance of the aya from a linguistic haqiqa by anchoring it in what he perceives to be a historical circumstance occasioning this aya. To sum up, al-Razi's figurative interpretation of your garments purify is not validated as an extension of a linguistic reality (i.e. idiom); instead, it is defined in terms of a lexical transference to a figurative sense. This transference from a real meaning (i.e. cleanse your clothes with water) is defended as a case of transference back to a historical one (i.e. the Prophet is commanded to purify himself from distress and anxiety at accusations of sorcery). In line with his rhetorical approach to majdz, al-Razi expresses his aversion to an unjustified and farfetched majdz verging on the allegorical, whereby the word 'garments' becomes a metonymy for wives without good reason. He is opposed to any unfounded figurative interpretation that is derived neither from the word's real sense (as when he figuratively reads your garments purify as 'shorten your clothes to avoid substantive impurities') nor from a real point in time (such as the occasion of its revelation). In al-Qurtubi, the term majdz is only encountered at the end of his comment on Q. 74:4. He primarily employs the rhetorical device of metonymy (kinaya) to ferret out the different possible referents of the word 'garments'. Al-Qurtubi's justification of these metonymical possibilities hinges on established language conventions. Evidence for the correctness of these idiomatic metaphors is garnered not only from the pre-Islamic poetic corpora but also from the speech of the Prophet himself as recorded in Hadith. His keenness on proving that each of the seven metonymies extends from conventional language usage results sometimes in the repetition of the same evidence for different meanings.50 As in al-Razi, the figurative interpretation is word-focused and the meanings rendered refer to tangible and intangible realities (actions, heart, soul, body, wives, moral character and religion). Al-Qurtubi does not defend these transferences in terms of rhetorical relations of contiguity or similarity like his predecessor. Rather, he relies on idiomatic evidence in a manner very similar to that of al-Tabari, thus reflecting the mixed philological and rhetorical legacy of majdz in this case. Notwithstanding these figurative interpretations of 'garments', the word 'purify (tahhirf is literally understood in al-Qurtubi even when it is transferred from a sense of 'cleansing' to a sense of 'shortening', possibly because it continues to signify some aspect of real purification from impurities. Hence, whether it is perceived to be of the tangible and physical (heart, body or wives), or the abstract and intangible (actions, soul, moral character and religion), the purification intended in Q. 74:4 is haqiqa.</page><page sequence="15">tahara in the Light of tafsir 73 Eschewing the complexities - and maybe the dangers - of majaz, Ibn Kathir refrains from using the term altogether. Nevertheless, non-literal readings are not precluded and we find in his discussion of Q. 74:4 the full range of meanings we encountered in the previous commentaries, though without any explicit distinction between the literal and the non-literal. Still perceiving a need to justify readings of your garments purify which go beyond the immediate sense of its terms, Ibn Kathir reverts back to an explanation entirely based on idiomatic use in the Arabic language. In summary, the non-literal interpretations of Q. 74:4 discussed here are all based on the extension or transference of the lexical meaning of keywords. In all cases, these non-literal interpretations are hinged on linguistic or historical evidence. Exegetes like al-Zamakhshari, al-Razi and al-Qurtubi who employ majaz to organise and/or justify these non-literal interpretations have made use of majaz lughawi, sl type of majaz concerned with the lexical and not the ontological meaning. Moreover, in several of the majaz applications, the purification was actually designated as haqiqa (e.g. purification of the soul in al-Razi and purification of religion in al-Qurtubi). In other words, what this means is that the use of majaz does not displace purification from reality to metaphor. Rather, it extends its field of signification to become inclusive of an ethical as well as a ritual sense. This ethical conception of purity is not at all alien to fiqh al-tahara and has been established long before Abu Hamid al-Ghazali's (d. 505/1111) efforts to infuse juristic knowledge with a moral theology. In a comment on the correct niyya necessary for rendering one's wudu3 (ritual ablution) functional, the early jurist Abu cUbayd al-Qasim ibn Sallam (d. 224/839), unequivocally states that:51 With all that has been said ... on wudu3 and its function of purifying [a person] from transgressions and sins (hattihi'l-dhunub wa'l khataya) which we reported at the outset, would anyone with an intellect imagine that he could attain these qualities without a deliberate intent to draw nearer to God? What this clearly indicates is that the aim of an outward purification like wudu3 is actually to bring about an ontological change in the status of the believer by ridding him from his acquired sins. The underlying principle is deontological, that is the function is realised through obedience to God. This clarifies the noticeable exegetical tolerance for maintaining literal and non-literal meanings simultaneously, and their lack of anxiety, except perhaps in Ibn Kathir, towards majaz as a hermeneutic tool. Working with a notion of purity as all-encompassing whereby outward and inward purification are ontologically and lexically linked, the exegetes are disinclined to make an explicit choice in favour of one or the other. This also explains the multiplicity of meanings encountered in the exegetical sources with regard to Q. 74:4. Such multiplicty may initially suggest that the conventional</page><page sequence="16">74 Journal of Qur'anic Studies view of traditional tafsir as engendering monovalent readings of the Qur'an in order to safely pin down its meaning is incorrect; and that, contrary to this view, tafsir embraces hermeneutic 'open-endedness' in a modern sense. A closer examination of this multiplicity from al-Tabari to Ibn Kathir, has confirmed that it is rationally controlled and justified within well-defined bounds of possible signification. Although there still remains much to be learned from tafsir about Qur'anic notions of purity and the ethical underpinning of tahara law, this paper has cast some initial light on the ways that tafsir can illuminate the underlying discourse of Islamic law.

The complete translations are available on www.altafsir.com. 3 The root t-h-r appears only three times in the imperative, two of which are addressed to Prophet Abraham and his son when they are commanded to build the House and purify it (Q. 2:125 and Q. 22:26), the third occasion is the one examined in this paper. 4 In fiqh, Q. 74:4 is sometimes evoked as evidence in the discussion on the necessity of purification from defiling substances in general or of the purity of garments worn for prayer in particular. There is disagreement, however, among schools of law as to its applicability to these questions. The origins of this disagreement are exegetical, a point that this article will discuss at some length. For a good summary of the different opinions in fiqh on Q. 74:4 see Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Rushd, Biddyat al-mujtahid (2 vols, Cairo: Maktabat al-Kulliyyat al-Azhariyya, 1974), vol. 1, pp. 86-9. 5 The exegetical tradition includes conflicting evidence on the chronological precedence of Q. 74:1-5 over Q. 96:1-5 as the very first piece of revelation. Those who uphold the precedence of Q. 74:1-5 fall back on the authority of the companion Jabir ibn cAbd Allah al Ansari (d. 78/697), who is reported to have suggested that Q. 74:1-5 marked the very beginning of revelation. Those who reject this opinion do so on the basis of Ibn Shihab al Zuhri's (d. 124/741) report that Q. 74:1-5 was the first to be revealed after a period of interruption in revelation. For an extensive discussion of the different traditions and the historical processes which resulted in the view that Q. 96:1-5 preceded Q. 74:1-5 see Uri Rubin, 'Some Notes On the Interpretation of Surat al-?Alaq\ Israel Oriental Studies 13 (1993), pp. 218-30. 6 Abu Jacfar Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari, Jdmi? al-baydn ?an ta'wll ay al-Qur'dn, 2nd edn (30 parts in 12 vols, Cairo: Maktabat Mustafa al-Babl al-Halabl wa-Awladihi, 1954), part 29, p. 145. 7 Qatada's anomalous interpretation reflects another Qur'anic context (Q. 5:1-6) where purification in God desires to purify you (Q. 5:6) is associated with the believers' compliance with the divine covenant referred to in O You who believe fulfil your contracts (Q. 5:1) (cf. al Tabari, Jdmi0 al-baydn, part 6, pp. 46-7). 8 Al-Tabari, Jdmi0 al-baydn, part 29, p. 146. This interpretation echoes a secondary occasion of revelation report, associated with Q. 74. This report, entirely ignored by al-Tabari,</page><page sequence="17">tahara in the Light of tafsir 75 recounts that the sura was revealed when the Prophet became distressed and wrapped up himself in his cloak as a result of verbal abuse directed at him by Quraysh (see Abu cAbd Allah Fakhr al-DIn Muhammad ibn ?Umar al-Razi, Mafdtih al-ghayb (al-tafslr al-kabir) (6 vols, n.p., n.d.), vol. 6, p. 391). 9 Al-Tabari, Jamic al-baydn, part 29, p. 147. 10 Al-Tabari, Jamic al-baydn, part 29, p. 147. 11 AbuT-Qasim Jar Allah Mahmud ibn cUmar al-Zamakhshari, al-Kashshaf can haqdciq al tanzil, 1st edn (4 vols, Cairo: Maktabat Mustafa al-Babl al-Halabi wa-Awladihi, 1966), vol. 4, p. 180. 12 An assessment of the application of majaz in relation to Q. 74:4 will be deferred to a later section of this paper. 13 Al-Zamakhshari, al-Kashshaf, vol. 4, p. 181. 14 Al-RazI, Mafdtih, vol. 6, p. 392. 15 Al-Razi, Mafdtih, vol. 6, pp. 392-3. 16 Al-Razi, Mafdtih, vol. 6, p. 393. 17 In his commentary on the interpretation of the defilement rijz, which the Prophet was instructed to shun in Q. 74:5, al-Razi denounces those, who on account of understanding rijz as signifying idol-worship and sins, claim that prophets are sinful (see al-Razi, Mafdtih, vol. 6, pp. 393-4). 18 Abu Bakr al-Shashl al-Qaffal (d. 336/948) is an usull scholar renowned for introducing the Shafici school into a dominantly Hanafl transoxiana and an exegete frequently cited in al Razi' s tafsir. 19 Al-RazI relates without ascription that the great men of Quraysh met to agree on giving the Prophet a derogatory designation such as 'poet', 'priest', 'mad', Tiar' and/or 'sorcerer'. They aimed to discredit him in the eyes of visiting Arab pilgrims in order to thwart his attempts at soliciting their support and allegiance (al-Razi, Mafdtih, vol. 6, p. 391). 20 Al-Razi, Mafdtih, vol. 6, p. 393. 21 Al-RazI, Mafdtih, vol. 6, p. 393. 22 Abu cAbd Allah Muhammad ibn Ahmad al-Qurtubi, al-Jamic li-ahkdm al-Qur'dn, 3rdedn (10 vols, Cairo: Dar al-Katib al-cArabI, 1967), vol. 10, p. 62. 23 In addition to Mujahid, Abu Razin and al-Suddi, al-Qurtubi attributes this reading to Ibn Zayd. This is unprecedented because in al-Tabari and al-Razi Ibn Zayd is the only advocate of a literal reading. 24 Al-Qurtubl, al-Jdmic, vol. 10, p. 63. 25 Though summoned by al-Qurtubi in support of those three metonymies of the word 'garments', Ibn Abbas does not mention any of them. Given that he has appeared earlier in al Tabari citing poetry to prove the idiomatic use of 'purify' and not 'garments', it is likely that this is an example of al-Qurtubfs creative use of old material. 26 Al-Qurtubi, al-Jdmic, vol. 10, p. 64. The elucidation of purity in terms of lawful sexuality reflects some of the standard readings of the verse of menstruation, Q. 2:222, which ends by mentioning that God loves those who purify themselves. 'Purify' in this case is usually understood as a reference to avoidance of sodomy and intercourse with women during menses. 27 Al-Qurtubi, al-Jamic, vol. 10, p. 64. 28 Al-Qurtubi's distinction between moral character and religious piety, when expanding on the different meanings of 'garments', can appear confusing since piety may be understood to apply to one's moral character. However, his further explanations of those two possibilities</page><page sequence="18">76 Journal of Qur'anic Studies suggest that the distinction is based on a view that morality and moral behaviour are not necessarily informed by one's religious faith. 29 Al-Qurtubi hardly ever cites chains of transmission for exegetical reports. However, on this occasion, he cites Malik's explication of Q. 74:4 with full transmission details going back to cAbd Allah ibn Nafic (d. 206/821), Malik's student and companion. 30 The Andalusian exegete AbQ Bakr Muhammad ibn cAbd Allah ibn al-?ArabI (d. 543/1148), author of the commentary Ahkdm al-Qur'dn, a work often cited by al-Qurtubi in his al-Jdmic. 31 Al-QurtubT, al-Jdmic, vol. 10, p. 65. 32 Al-Qurtubi, al-Jdmic, vol. 10, p. 65. 33 Al-Qurtubi, al-Jdmic, vol. 10, p. 66. 34 cImad al-DIn Abu'l-Fida3 IsmacIl ibn Kathir, Tafsir al-Qur'dn al-cazim (4 vols, Beirut: Dar al-Jll, n.d.), vol. 4, p. 441. 35 Ibn Kathir, Tafsir al-Qur'dn al-cazim, vol. 4, p. 441. 36 In his examination of the rhetorical interpretation of al-Sharlf al-Radl (d. 406/1015) entitled Talkhis al-baydn fi majdzdt al-Qur'dn, Kamal Abu-Deeb finds al-Radl's interpretation of this simple Qur'anic command telling the Prophet to keep his clothes clean in Q. 74:4 quite striking because of the multiplicity of interpretations offered by the latter for the word garments (thiydb), e.g. the self, deeds, acts relating to the self, or a command to choose pure wives (Kamal Abu-Deeb, 'Studies in the Majaz and Metaphorical Language of the Qur'an: Abu cUbayda and al-Sharif al-Radl' in Issa Boullata (ed.), Literary Structures of Religious Meaning in the Qur'an (Surrey: Curzon, 2000), pp. 310-53, p. 321). Attention must be drawn to the fact that this 'diversity' of interpretations is not the outcome of the sole efforts of al-Radl since he apparently reproduces the prevalent readings of this aya in traditional tafasir. Exegetical works are therefore better assessed against the genre in which they were produced. 37 Ella Almagor, 'The Early Meaning of Majdz and the Nature of Abu cUbayda's Exegesis' in Y. Navon et al.

For instance, regarding the meaning of 'taste the touch of saqar (hellfireY in Q. 54:56, al-Tabari explains that the use of 'tasting' in connection with hellfire is justified by some exegetes as permissible speech such as when it is said: T have known the taste of fever' (www.altafsir.com/Tafasir.asp?tMadhNo=Q&amp;tTafsirNo=l&amp;tSoraNo =54&amp;tAyahNo=46&amp;tDisplay=yes&amp;UserProfile=0&gt;). 42 Al-Tabari, Jdmic al-baydn, part 29, pp. 145-6. 43 Al-Tabari, Jdmic al-baydn, part 29, p. 147.</page><page sequence="19">tahara in the Light of tafsir 11 44 Al-Tabari's conception of purification from sins as real and tangible is compellingly emphasised in his comment on the closing statement of the wudu' verse, God desires to purify you (Q. 5:6), where he describes the different purity rituals of cleansing with water or pure dust as intended to cleanse the body of the believer from sin. This moral purification is quite clearly construed in physical terms: 4God desires to purify you with ablution {wudu3) from minor impurity (hadath), with lustration from major impurity (jandba), and with recourse to pure sand (tayammum) in the absence of water, all of which He ordained, so that you may cleanse and purify your bodies from sins with those acts {tunazzifu wa-tutahhiru bi-dhdlik ajsdmakum min al-dhunub) (al-Tabari, Jamic al-baydn, part 6, p. 138, the emphasis in both the endnote and the quotation in the main text is mine). 45 Cf.

Al-RazI was quite familiar with the juristic take on majaz. In his comment on rijz in Q. 74:5 he justifies a majaz interpretation as follows: 'the cause may acquire the name of its effect by virtue of a [rhetorical] principle, whereby something acquires the name of something else because of its proximity to it or because it is a reason for it' (al-Razi, Mafdtih, vol. 6, p. 393). This application is almost identical to the definition of the sixth type of majaz as a juristic method in the work of the Hanafi jurist al-Jassas (d. 370/981).
