<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEW: THE ART OF TAHITI - BY YVONNE NEVERSON This book titled fThe Art of Tahiti1 written by Terence Barrow is part of a new series of ethnographic art books by Thames and Hudson which sells at the reasonable price of £2.95. It is basically a picture book fitted with seventy or so colour and black and white photographs of Polynesian Art objects found in both museum and private collections. Although titled rThe Art of Tahiti* Barrow does not concentrate solely on that island but refers to it simply as the largest group of the Society Islands with which the Cook and Austral Islands form a cultural unit. This book is about the art of this cultural unit. The decline of Tahiti an society began soon after its initial discovery in 1767 by Captain Wallis when whalers, traders, merchants and finally missionaries set about changing the traditions and customs of the Tahiti an society* The artifacts which were saved from destruction were therefore made by early collectors and drawings done by Webber and Parkinson, artists on Cooks voyages are the only fragmentary evidence that remains for us to build a more comprehensive picture of traditional Tahiti an society. Barrow achieves a degree of this comprehension by briefly describing the social structure of Tahiti: the three distinct classes; the domestic crafts; clothing and tattooing; symbols of rank such as wooden seats, wooden head rests, fly whisk, helmet , spears , staffs, waistband; canoes which range from small dugouts to war galleys of more than a hundred feet. More detail is given with regard to religion and temples which played such an important part in Tahiti an life. The symbols of Tahiti an gods are termed toro and can oe represented by stones, feathers, strings of sennit, shell, birds or almost any natural or artificial objects The wooden anthropomorphic images, tifi, served as vehicles of gods in the ancient Tahiti an past but were used for many purposes although the precise use of individual ti1 i figures and the spirits they represent is not known« It is the unique double-headed ti'i from the British Museum which is the dramatic cover of the book. The section on the Austral Islands is not as detailed as the previous chapter. The brief and sporadic contact made by Europeans prevented much recording of the culture. Although the islands were discovered by Captain Cook in 1769 it was not until 1822 that the London Missionary Society was established which was the symbol for the decline of a previously vigorous traditional culture. The sculptural art of the Austral Islands is known from a meagre scattering of mostly undocumented pieces. The two centres of carving were the island of Rurutu with its spectacular iconography and beautifully carved fly whisks and the island of Ra'ivaivae, which is well known for its 'ceremonial1 paddles, ladles and bowls. In the final chapter on the Cook Islands Barrow briefly deals with housing and clothing, concentrates on the religious arts (carvings) which were supported by the high chiefs (ariki) and the lesser chiefs (rangatira). The decorative ritual carvings are divided into five categories each of which Barrow describes in greater details. They range from: the fishermens gods, the god images with secondary figures, the staff gods with anthropomorphic heads and phallic ends; male and slab gods and ceremonial adzes.

Due to the limits of fifteen thousand words he has admitted 'light treatment' of important ceremonies such as kara-drinking and activities such as archery and canoe-building which may not please ethnographers. Nevertheless with detailed tables, a concise text and excellent photographs 'The Art of Tahiti' makes for enjoyable reading for the general public. (19)</page></plain_text>
