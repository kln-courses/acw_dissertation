PAL. pede ego iam illam huc tibi sistam in viam. 344 pedes, corr. Acidalius In the absence of an explanation why (with ACIDALIUS' conjecture)' Palaestrio need mention that he is setting the girl on her feet (or foot), it may be worth considering a different correction for pedes. Perhaps des: this could have been corrupted by dittogra- phy from the preceding -re or by a misread indication of change of speaker (e.g. &gt;P des&lt;). For the subjunctive following dare see TLL V 1, 1691, lOff. An incidental benefit of this change is that sistam can then have the legal nuance common in Plautus (appropriate to a context where a proof is being given), which would be obscured by pede. Plaut. Pseud. 840-843 COC. ubi omnes patinae fervont, omnis aperio: is odos dimissis manibus in caelum volat. BAL. odos dimissis manibus? COC. peccavi insciens. BAL. quidum? COC. dimissis pedibus volui dicere. 841 demissis AP; item 842 A, 843 P manibus A: pedibus P 842 manibus A: pedibus P 843 quia (quiam B) demissis manibus v. d. P The text above is that of LEO, who follows A (except that he ignores variations between di- and demissis). The same text had been defended and explained by P. LANGEN, Plautinische Studien, Berlin, 1886, 364f., as follows: the cook describes the heavenward ascent of the smell of cooking in a standard expression for hurrying, taken from the posture of a man running; Ballio expresses surprise at the use of the expression for something with no hands; the cook corrects himself by unexpectedly replacing the phrase not with a more acceptable metaphor, but with mere nonsense2. The least satisfactory part of this seems to be the punchline; perhaps one might consider a solution that takes I V. ACIDALIUS, In Comoedias Plauti, quae exstant, Divinationes et Interpretationes, Frank- furt, 1607, 283 sq. &gt;Pede aut pedibus scribendum puto, ut iocetur in loquendi modo, quo alias capite sistere dixit&lt;. He cites Capt. 793 ore sistet, Curc. 287 capite sistat and Mil. 850 capite, in all of which the ablative is necessary to express the idea of overturning. 2 This would admittedly be untypical. Most slips of the tongue in Plautus are followed not by a further elaboration of the joke, but by correction to the normal expression, e.g. Rud. 422 subvolturium - illud quidem, subaquilum volui dicere, Friv. frg. 8 papillae ... sororiabant; illud volui dicere, Ifraterculabant. The same pattemn could be obtained here by following the readings of P; but only LANGEN'S explanation seems to take account of the particular form of Ballio's objection in 842. Hermes, 130.

If Plautus had written: quidum?:: quia manibus pedibus volui dicere. he would have given the cook a replacement turn of phrase for dimissis manibus which offered a very similar sense (&gt;with every exertion&lt;) but was twice as offensive in its anthropomorphism (feet, now, as well as hands)4. One could then imagine that the confusions in P began with an attempt to correct a text like that in A by replacing dimissis with quia manibus, a correction which would easily have been displaced by expectations that manibus must be correcting the similar pedibus5. Munchen NIGEL HOLMES 3 Fifteen of the nineteen instances in Plautus; the exceptions are Men. 161. Most. 733. Pseud. 161 and our passage. 4 The expression manibus pedibus occurs twice in Roman comedy (Ter. Andr. 161; 676) and again in Fronto p. 192, 8. S My thanks to Prof. H. D. JOCELYN and Dr. P.
