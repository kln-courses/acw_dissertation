<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Return of Trinitarian Praxis? Moltmann on the Trinity and the Christian Life* Joy Ann McDougall / Emory University The twentieth century has seen many a dramatic turn in theology, but per- haps none so startling as the contemporary renaissance of trinitarian doc- trine. In the past thirty years trinitarian debates have crossed confessional and continental borders and sparked new ecumenical discussion among the European, North American, and once-called Third World contexts.' Within the Anglo-American context, this burgeoning trinitarian debate has galvanized around one issue: the practical significance of the doctrine for the life of faith. Theologians spanning the methodological spectrum- from postliberal narrative theologians and process thinkers to feminists and other liberationists-are exploring the relationship between the Trinity and various practices of the Christian life. Certainly there are wide disagreements among these theologians about what exactly constitutes trinitarian praxis.2 Some situate the practical relevance of the doctrine in *I am grateful to my colleaguesJames W.

As Roman Catholic theologian Elizabeth Johnson argues, the symbol of God "func- tions": "[it] powerfully molds the corporate identity of the Christian com- munity, highlights its values and directs its praxis."5 No contemporary theologian has played a more decisive role in retriev- ing the practical significance of trinitarian theology than German Re- formed theologian Jiurgen Moltmann. Already in The Crucified God (1972), Moltmann traced the ills of modern Christian theology-its twin crises of "relevance" and "identity"-to the eclipse of its distinctive trinitarian un- derstanding of God.' He decried the dispassionate and distant God of modern theism as not only incommensurate with the God revealed in the cross event, but also as irrelevant to the pressing challenges of protest and secular atheism. In The Trinity and the Kingdom (1981), Moltmann widened his critique by showing how the modern demise of the doctrine had arisen from the flawed historical development of Western trinitarian thought. He charged that Western trinitarian doctrine was actually a form of latent monarchianism, which tended to subordinate the distinct persons of Fa- ther, Son, and Holy Spirit to the absolute monarchy of the one God. Ac- cording to Moltmann, this "monotheistic monarchianism" has had trou- bling consequences not only for the Western doctrine of the Trinity but Christian practices in second-order theological discourse and in the catechesis of Christian believers.

Chopp, "Praxis," in The New Dictionary of Catholic Spirituality, ed. Michael Downey (Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press, 1993), pp. 756-64.

It has provided a theological justifica- tion for structures of domination and subordination in the familial, polit- ical, and ecclesial realms of human existence.8 In the mid-seventies Moltmann moved beyond critique to reconstruc- tion of the doctrine. His aim was to formulate "concrete doctrine" and "practical theory" that would relate the doctrine of the Trinity to the ex- perience and the practices of contemporary believers.9 In The Trinity and the Kingdom Moltmann set this ambitious theological program into mo- tion. He proposed a social doctrine of the Trinity in which the kingdom of God is conceived in communal terms as fellowship or koinonia. The prac- tical significance of Moltmann's trinitarian theology rested on his bold claim that trinitarian fellowship not only describes divine community but also prescribes the nature of true human community. "True human fel- lowship," Moltmann contended, "is to correspond to the triune God and be his image on earth. True human fellowship will participate in the inner life of the triune God.""' In the ensuing volumes of his Messianic Theology, Moltmann sought to make good on this claim. He developed a theology of creation, christology, pneumatology, and eschatology, all of which illu- minate how human beings become visible images of this trinitarian fel- lowship on earth. Although Moltmann is widely acknowledged for having pioneered this turn to trinitarian praxis, his theology has hardly been exempt from criticism. In his recent book These Three Are One: The Practice of Trinitarian Theology, David Cunningham commends Moltmann for turning the doc- trine to political and social issues, and for his efforts to formulate the doc- trine in terms of the concrete narratives of the Father, Son, and Spirit in the Scriptures. Nonetheless, Cunningham criticizes the "high level of ab- straction" of Moltmann's social trinitarian program." In his view, its prac- tical recommendations are too unspecific to engage the challenging issues facing Christian communities today.12 Curiously enough, others level the opposite criticism at Moltmann's trinitarian theology. They charge him with overfreighting trinitarian doctrine, by indiscriminately applying concepts usually reserved for the 7 Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, p. 131. 8 For this critique of the trajectory of Western trinitarian thought and its devastating po- litical and ecclesial consequences, see ibid., pp. 10-16, 129-48, 191-222.

In his book Persons in Communion, Alan Torrance criticizes how Moltmann portrays the Trinity's relationship to the world. In Torrance's view, Moltmann ties God's being too closely to the progress of human history and, in so doing, compromises the transcendence and sovereignty of the triune God over creation. Torrance charges his Re- formed colleague not only with immanentalizing the trinitarian life but also with escalating the human being's role in salvation. He warns of "Pelagian tendencies" in Moltmann's messianic theology, especially in the way in which he depicts a person's "doxological participation in the transcendent triune life" as a task to be achieved rather than an "event of grace."13 Karen Kilby's criticisms of Moltmann's social trinitarian program are even more trenchant. In her recent article, "Perichoresis and Projection: Problems with Social Doctrines of the Trinity,:' Kilby raises a series of methodological objections about the contemporary enthusiasm for social doctrines of the Trinity. 4 Moltmann serves as her chief exemplar to show how contemporary trinitarian theologians first indulge in using highly an- thropomorphic language to create social analogies for the divine life and then reverse the direction of these analogies and propose them as norms for human relationships. At such points, social doctrines of the Trinity such as Moltmann's enter into vicious hermeneutical circles, in which the theologian does little to clarify the divine life but projects onto it his or her preferred political ideals and ethical values for human society. Further- more, Kilby criticizes Moltmann for misappropriating terms drawn from the theological tradition, which were meant to refer exclusively to aspects of the immanent Trinity (most notably the term "perichoresis"), and using such terms to norm human relations. These conflicting interpretations of Moltmann's trinitarian theology raise significant challenges both to its methodology and to its practical import. Among the various critiques raised, three doctrinal issues are worth careful investigation. First, what are the true sources for Molt- mann's vision of the trinitarian life? More pointedly, is his central concept of trinitarian life as fellowship (koinonia) rooted in revelation-in God's creating, redeeming, and sanctifying activities in history-or is it a thinly veiled projection of Moltmann's own social agenda? Second, how does Moltmann recast Christian life of discipleship in social trinitarian terms? How is the believer freed and formed by grace to perform works of fel- lowship of her own, and how well does this comport itself with the classi- "3AlanJ.

Third and finally, how practical in the end is Moltmann's social trinitarian program? Does his notion of trinitarian fellowship provide a sturdy theological framework to guide contemporary believers into a creative and prophetic disciple- ship in the world? In this essay, I take up each of these doctrinal issues by elucidating the key theological strategy that ties the Trinity to the Christian life in Molt- mann's social trinitarian program-what I call his "social trinitarian analogy of fellowship."'' By this term, I refer to how Moltmann utilizes the distinctive model of personal relations that constitute trinitarian fel- lowship as his divine archetype for right relationships in the personal, ec- clesial, and political spheres of the Christian life. My argument proceeds in three steps. In the first section, I identify the sources as well as the es- sential attributes of Moltmann's doctrine of the Trinity by examining how the author interprets Jesus' life, death, and resurrection as a narrative rendering of the economic and immanent trinitarian fellowship. In so doing, I respond to the queries that Kilby raises about the nature and le- gitimacy of divine predication in Moltmann's social trinitarian theology. At the same time, I establish the relational ontology of love that frames Moltmann's trinitarian theology of grace. Second, I investigate how Molt- mann reconfigures salvation and the process of sanctification in terms of the Eastern Orthodox model of deification. Here my focus is on the process by which human beings participate in the divine life and whether this schema so elevates the human being's role in sanctification that, as Torrance suggests, a certain works righteousness creeps into Moltmann's theology. Third and finally, I assess the doctrine's practical implications by identifying a central category that shapes trinitarian praxis-the no- tion of "open friendship."'' Here I seek to respond to Cunningham's con- cern about this social trinitarian program's impracticality by demonstrat- ing how this model of Christian hospitality both transforms the notion of human freedom and invites passionate fellowship with those who are "othered" in society. " Here I adapt and expand in trinitarian terms the notion of "divine analogy" as devel- oped by the late British theologian and political theorist David Nicholls. Nicholls uses this term to refer to the correspondences between a theologian's concept of God and the struc- tures of the political order; see David Nicholls, Deity and Domination: Images of God and the State in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries (London and New York: Routledge, 1989), esp. pp. 5-30, 232-45. For the purpose of this essay, I am expanding this term to include the analogy between Moltmann's concept of trinitarian fellowship and interpersonal relations in the so- cial sphere. Compare my development of this social trinitarian analogy in Sec. II below. '6Jfirgen Moltmann, The Spirit of Life: A Universal Affirmation, trans. Margaret Kohl (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1992), p. 258. Although "open friendship" is a category that appears in several of his works, Moltmann presents one of his lengthiest discussions of it in The Spirit of Life (cf. pp. 255-59). 181</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Religion After I defend Moltmann's social trinitarian theology against these three authors' disparate criticisms and misreadings, I raise my own criti- cal questions about a largely overlooked aspect of his theology, his doc- trine of sin. Here I contend that Moltmann's lack of a robust doctrine of sin contributes to a certain utopianism in his social trinitarian program that, in turn, leaves it open to the charge of impracticality. I conclude by framing the constructive possibilities of a full-blown social trinitarian doc- trine of sin, particularly in terms of strengthening the prophetic, critical, and messianic potential of trinitarian praxis. I. THE GOD OF TRINITARIAN FELLOWSHIP A. A Biblical Root for a Social Trinitarianism At the heart of Kilby's critique of projectionism in Moltmann's social trini- tarian theology lies a central methodological query: what are the true sources for the author's doctrinal reconstruction? Is his proposed vision of the kingdom of trinitarian fellowship rooted in God's saving action in the world or is it rather an interpolation of Moltmann's preferred social val- ues and political ideals? We gain an initial response to this question by turning to Moltmann's self-declared sources and norms for his doctrinal reconstruction. While Moltmann's social trinitarian theology has surely been a work in progress during the past twenty years, one aspect has remained consistent through- out: the biblical witness has been his governing source and norma normans for his doctrinal reconstruction. John O'Donnell explains Moltmann's methodological intent succinctly: "To let the biblical revelation create its own ontology."" Following Barth's hermeneutical lead, Moltmann defends the Trinity's "biblical root" in the Scriptures and contends that the doctrine is a true and necessary interpretation of the New Testament witness.'" Molt- mann treats the New Testament as an account of three divine persons' ac- tivities and ever-changing relationships to one another in the economy of salvation. He resists subsuming this complex story into a general concept and develops instead what I call a "narrative approach" to the doctrine.'9 '"John J. O'Donnell, Trinity and Temporality: The Christian Doctrine of God in the Light of Process Theology and the Theology of Hope (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1983), p. 115. ' See Moltmann's early defense of the scriptural root of the doctrine in Jiirgen Moltmann, 'Antwort auf die Kritik an 'Der greuzigte Gott,'" in Diskussion iiberJiirgen Moltmanns Buch "Der gekreuzigte Gott," ed. and introduction by Michael Welker (Munich: Chr. Kaiser, 1977), pp. 165-90, here pp. 176-77. Moltmann parts ways with Barth over the latter's interpreta- tion of the doctrine's biblical root in terms of divine lordship. For the details of their exeget- ical disagreement, cf. Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom (n. 1 above), pp. 60-65. "gAlthough Moltmann has not allied himself explicitly with the narrative theology of the 182</page><page sequence="7">Moltmann on Trinitarian Praxis He isolates different plot lines within the biblical text that trace the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit's relationships and activities with one another and then draws these together into a composite narrative-what he terms the "trinitarian history of the Father, the Son and Spirit."20 According to Moltmann, this trinitarian history not only narrates salva- tion history, but it also constitutes the very life of the Trinity. The triune God is none other than the self-giving of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the world-a self-giving that reaches its depths in the cross event and cul- minates with the glorification of all creation in the eternal trinitarian life. On this point Moltmann subscribes to a version of Karl Rahner's identity axiom: "The 'economic' Trinity truly is the 'immanent' Trinity and the 'immanent' Trinity is the 'economic' Trinity."2' He reformulates Rahner's axiom by emphasizing the identity between the loving relationships of the trinitarian persons with the world and the essence of the divine life: "The history of salvation is the history of the eternally living, triune God who draws us into and includes us in his eternal triune life with all the fullness of its relationships. .... God loves the world with the very same love which he is in himself."22 Moltmann maintains a central christological plot to his trinitarian his- tory of God, although he creates more elaborate versions of this history as his Messianic Theology proceeds. From start to finish Jesus is "the revealer of the Trinity," insofar as his life, death, and resurrection disclose in a unique and definitive manner the dynamic relationships among the di- vine persons and their fellowship with one another.23 The first clue to these intradivine relations is the life-giving relationship that Jesus shares with his "Abba" Father. Moltmann speaks of an "unheard-of intimacy" between Yale School, his Barthian insistence on the realism of the scriptural witness and his suspicion of speculative concepts distorting the particularity of scriptural revelation has striking simi- larities to this approach. For an excellent discussion of the similar concerns in the actualism of Barth's theology of revelation, see George Hunsinger, How to Read Karl Barth: The Shape of His Theology (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1991), pp. 67-75. 2Jiirgen Moltmann, "The Inviting Unity of the Triune God," in his History and the Triune God, pp. 80-89, here p. 83. 21 Karl Rahner, The Trinity, trans. Joseph Donceel (New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 1970), p. 22. 22 Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, p. 157 (my emphasis). Moltmann does affirm Karl Rahner's identity axiom but adds a doxological and messianic qualification to it. Compare his discussion of Rahner's thesis in Moltmann, The Crucified God (n. 6 above), p. 240, and The Trinity and the Kingdom, p. 160. 23 Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, p. 65. In later works Moltmann does balance the christocentrism of his earlier trinitarian theology with a new appreciation for the Holy Spirit's role in the economy of salvation. For example, in The Way ofJesus Christ and The Spirit of Life, he portrays the history of the Son and the history of the Spirit as intertwined narra- tives, in which the Spirit and Jesus Christ work together to accomplish human salvation. Compare his discussion of a "pneumatological christology," in Jiirgen Moltmann, The Way of Jesus Christ: Christology in Messianic Dimensions, trans. Margaret Kohl (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1989), p. 73, and a "christological pneumatology," in his The Spirit of Life, p. 58. 183</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Religion the two that overturns all previous notions of divine lordship.24 Here the author draws especially on the Old Testament idea of the maternal com- passion, the life-giving mercy of God, to describe the Father's relationship to his beloved Son. This life-giving mercy signifies a creative suffering out of which springs both freedom and new life. In Moltmann's words, divine mercy "denotes the pain of bringing the dead to life, of liberating the pris- oners and loosing those who are bound.""25 We thus discover the first glimmers of the nature of trinitarian fellow- ship in the relationship of Father and Son: it is an infinite self-giving-an ecstatic generosity that involves a dialectic of suffering and creative pas- sion out of which springs forth ever-greater life. The nature of this infinite self-giving emerges vividly once we trace the entire history of the Son, from his being sent into the world, to his surrender at the cross, and on to his glorification. Moltmann depicts the Son's incarnation as an event of free self-giving that involves all three persons of the Trinity. This trinitar- ian self-donation is both an outward movement toward the world and a reciprocal inward movement among the divine relations. On the side of creation, the Father's self-giving of the Son involves a communication of the Father's eternal essence, his infinite goodness, into the world. Through the power of the Holy Spirit, the Father opens the exclusive fel- lowship that he shares with the Son to all human beings. On the divine side, this outward movement involves an inward self-donation among the divine persons where "in the sending of the Son, God ... yields himself up.""26 Here the Son responds to the Father's yielding himself up by taking up his own mission into the world. The Holy Spirit participates equally in this reciprocal self-giving of the Son and the Father as the mediator of their fellowship. The Spirit's self-giving inspires Jesus' proclamation, em- powers his ministry, and accompanies him unto the cross. This divine self-giving culminates in the Trinity's shared self-surrender at the cross event. Moltmann depicts the cross event as a reciprocal sacri- fice of love, in which "the communicating love of the Father turns into in- finite pain" and "the responding love of the Son becomes infinite suffer- ing."27 The cross is not a one-sided sacrifice in which the Son plays the passive object or victim of the Father's will. Rather, the Son undertakes the way to the cross deliberately; his is a "passio activa.'"28 Nor does the Father remain unmoved by the Son's sacrifice. In giving up the Son, he, too, sur- renders himself, by experiencing the pain of becoming Sonless.

Although the particular relationships among the divine persons in this trinitarian narrative are ever-changing, the unity of their being lies in their common action-their perfectly reciprocal patterns of self-giving toward one another. Neither a hierarchy of wills nor a subordi- nation of persons exists within this triune communion. The self-giving of- fered by one is returned freely and fully by the mirror action of another. As Moltmann puts it, "the divine persons Father, Son and Holy Spirit ex- ist at the same time for each other and in each other in such an intimate way that through themselves they form their complete, trinitarian unity."31 The cross event reveals not only mutuality but also the infinite depths of this trinitarian self-giving for humankind. At the cross, human beings discover the utter boundlessness of divine mercy-a "love which does everything--gives everything--suffers everything-for lost men and women."32 And yet, this boundless self-giving is not an act of divine self- dissolution; metaphorically speaking, this sacrifice stretches but does not rupture the unity of trinitarian fellowship. Fellowship continues to join the Father and the Son through the actions of the Holy Spirit who bridges the divide between them. The Holy Spirit binds the Father and Son to- gether in fellowship-a fellowship that at the cross is painfully experi- enced in Moltmann's terms as "a dividing curse" between them.33 As the divine persons experience separation, loss, and abandonment, the nature of divine fellowship turns from creative freedom into suffering love. If the Father and the Son are the central persons in the events of the in- carnation and the self-surrender of the cross, the Holy Spirit takes center stage in this drama from the resurrection event to the eschaton. The Spirit is the power of new creation through which the Father raises the Son from the dead and exalts him into the eternal fellowship of love. Moltmann speaks here of Jesus as the Son rising "into the coming kingdom of God" and into "the innermost being of God himself.""4 This eschatological stage of the trinitarian history continues until the Son ultimately returns the kingdom to the Father. Until that time the Holy Spirit continues her work 29Moltmann, The Spirit of Life (n. 16 above), p. 64, quoting Mark 15:37. 30 Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom (n. 1 above), p. 82. 3 Moltmann, "'The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit': On Trinitarian Pneumatology" (n. 10 above), p. 59. 32 Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, p. 83. 33Ibid., p. 80. 34 Ibid., p. 88. 185</page><page sequence="10">The Journal of Religion of new creation in the world, drawing human beings into the fellowship of Father and Son and with one another. She imbues all of creation with the vitality and the messianic hope of new possibilities of fellowship in the world. B. The Nature of Trinitarian Fellowship Three key attributes of trinitarian fellowship have now come into our view, none of which can be missed when grasping Moltmann's vision of the Christian life. First and foremost, trinitarian fellowship signifies the com- munion shared among the three divine persons. Trinitarian fellowship is neither the attribute of one single divine person nor a reality distinct from their personal relations. Rather, it signifies the "social unity" that is con- stituted by the reciprocal self-giving love among Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.35 Moltmann borrows the ancient term perichoresis, drawn from the Eastern Church Father, John the Damascene, to describe the nature of this communion among the divine persons. Perichoresis signifies the cir- cling movements of mutual indwelling that arise from the three persons' eternal acts of self-donation. This mutual indwelling creates a dynamic unity or at-oneness that constitutes their fellowship. In this circling move- ment of love, the divine persons do not simply exist in relationship with one another, but they live in and through one another. As Moltmann de- scribes it, "By virtue of the love they have for one another they ex-ist to- tally in the other.... Each Person finds his existence and his joy in the other Person. Each Person receives the fullness of eternal life from the other."''3 The divine persons realize not only their unity but also their personal distinctions through these acts of mutual indwelling. Self- differentiation and self-donation do not oppose one another in this fel- lowship but come into existence together. Radical equality is the second key feature of trinitarian fellowship. This may not seem a terribly unique claim, since trinitarian orthodoxy has al- ways affirmed that all three persons are "of one being" and, therefore, of equal rank. However, in Moltmann's view, Western trinitarian theology has compromised the equality of the divine persons, by developing the doctrine in terms of a descending order of processions from God the Fa- ther. Indeed Moltmann charges that the West has always preserved a "3Jiirgen Moltmann, "Creation, Covenant and Glory: A Conversation on Karl Barth's Doc- trine of Creation," in his History and the Triune God (n. 9 above), pp. 125-42, here p. 131. Molt- mann champions this social model of divine unity over and against two models of divine unity that are based on "absolute substance" and "an absolute subject" and that have domi- nated Western trinitarian theology. For Moltmann's critique of these models, cf. Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, pp. 129-50. 36 Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, pp. 173-74. 186</page><page sequence="11">Moltmann on Trinitarian Praxis "monarchial concept of the Trinity," in which the Father serves as the source of all divine activity, the Son as mediator between the Father and humankind, and the Holy Spirit as the power of the other two."7 The ad- dition of thefilioque clause (the dual procession of the Spirit from the Fa- ther and the Son) to the Nicene creed cemented this monarchial order in place in the West, since this clause eclipsed further the Holy Spirit's per- sonal agency in the sending and the raising of the Son. In contrast to this monarchial concept of the Trinity, Moltmann dramatically defends the equality of the divine persons. The dynamic patterns of giving and re- ceiving among Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in the economy of salvation witness to the equal rank and mutual interdependence of all three persons in the trinitarian kingdom. As Moltmann writes: "In this kingdom God is not the Lord; he is the merciful Father. In this kingdom there are no ser- vants; there are only God's free children. In this kingdom what is required is not obedience and submission; it is love and free participation."" This trinitarian kingdom is free from all structures of domination and subju- gation; reciprocal friendship and a spirit of mercy and liberty govern in this trinitarian kingdom. The third and final key feature of trinitarian fellowship is what I term its infinite generosity. I introduce this term (which is not Moltmann's) to stress that the divine essence bestows itself freely and without reserve upon the whole of creation. In Moltmann's words, "[God] is engendering and creative love.... Creation exists because the eternal love commu- nicates himself creatively to his Other.""39 In The Trinity and the Kingdom, Moltmann borrows the Neo-Platonist conceptuality of the "passionate self-communication of the good" in order to describe more fully this ec- static generosity of the trinitarian Godhead: "Love wants to live and to give life. It wants to open up the freedom to live. That is why love is the self-communication of the good without self-renunciation, and the self- giving of the good without self-dissolution."40 Elsewhere Moltmann de- picts this overflowing generosity of trinitarian fellowship in strictly figu- rative terms. The Trinity, he suggests, is not a closed circle-a life sufficient unto itself. Rather, it is an "open and inviting" communion, de- siring to share itself freely with its creation.41 In sum, trinitarian fellowship is a creative and passionate communion of self-giving love, in which the divine persons donate themselves boundlessly to one another and to the whole of creation. 7 Moltmann, The Spirit of Life, pp. 290-91. 8 Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, p. 70. 39Ibid., p. 59. 40Ibid., p. 57. 4" Moltmann, "'The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit': On Pneumatology" (n. 10 above); see also his "The Inviting Unity of the Triune God" (n. 20 above), p. 87. 187</page><page sequence="12">The Journal of Religion Moltmann himself resists using conceptual formulas to portray the trinitarian life. Nonetheless, I propose that if we synthesize these three key features together, Moltmann's God of trinitarian fellowship can be help- fully redescribed as the God who is "free in love" and as the God who "frees in love.""42 The first of these terms indicates that the divine attributes of freedom and love coincide in trinitarian fellowship. Divine freedom does not signify a freedom from relationality-a form of absolute self- possession and self-sufficiency of the three divine persons unto them- selves. Just the opposite: the freedom of trinitarian fellowship consists in love-in the giving of fellowship away creatively and boundlessly to others. In Moltmann's words, "[God's] freedom ... lies in the friendship which he offers men and women, and through which he makes them his friends.""3 Because the trinitarian fellowship creates human beings to be its partner in fellowship, we can speak of this God not only as "free in love" but also as the God who "frees in love." This divine gift of freedom is not merely a freedom from the past, a backward-looking forgiveness for sin, but also forward-looking freedom for fellowship. The Trinity invites hu- man beings to share in this dynamic communion of love by offering to them its very essence-the creative capacity to love others. Through the gift of fellowship human beings are in turn empowered to offer fellowship to one another. C. Trinitarian Fellowship: Defying the Limits of Divine Predication? In light of this reading of Moltmann's concept of trinitarian fellowship, let us return briefly to Kilby's criticisms of Moltmann's social trinitarian the- ology. To recall: Kilby charges that Moltmann oversteps epistemological limits by describing in elaborate passion-filled terms the immanent trini- tarian life; in her view, such terms are projections of Moltmann's preferred social and political agenda. Further, she questions whether this very same language can be used prescriptively to guide human relationships. In re- sponse to Kilby's criticisms, a couple of points can be made in favor of Moltmann's anthropomorphic descriptions of the divine life. 2 The attentive reader will surely note that my two formulas are slight variations on Barth's concept of God as "the One who loves in freedom" (Karl Barth, Church Dogmatics 2/1, par. 28, quoted in Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom [n. 1 above], p. 55). These two formulas help clarify the relationship between the divine attributes of love and freedom in Moltmann's work and the slight differences in emphasis to Barth's position. For Moltmann's critique of Barth's treatment of the relationship between divine freedom and love, see Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, pp. 52-56. For a more detailed discussion of the relationship between love and freedom in Moltmann's mature social trinitarian theology, see Joy A. McDougall, "The Pilgrimage of Love: The Trinitarian Theology ofJiirgen Moltmann" (Ph.D. diss., Uni- versity of Chicago, 1998), pp. 139-44. " Moltmann, The Trinity and the Kingdom, p. 56. 188</page><page sequence="13">Moltmann on Trinitarian Praxis First, Kilby's critique overlooks Moltmann's stated biblical foundation of his social trinitarian theology. As I have argued above, Moltmann roots his description of the trinitarian kingdom on an interpretation of the economy of salvation that he gleans from a narrative reading of the Scriptures. In so doing, he not only adheres closely to the soteriological axiom that he borrows from Rahner's trinitarian theology, but he also re- mains true to his own methodological intent to let the biblical witness govern his doctrine's development. Second, the christological sources for Moltmann's trinitarian history of God run deep in the New Testa- ment-not only in Jesus' proclamation of the kingdom but also in how this kingdom becomes manifest in the fellowship expressed in the cross and resurrection events. Although Moltmann uses indubitably anthro- pomorphic language to describe the trinitarian life, he relies on metaphors of passion, particularly those of suffering and joy, to describe the divine persons' relationships to one another and toward human- kind. Here, too, he has ample precedents within both Testaments for using such language, for example, in the Psalms, in the Pauline litera- ture as well as the Gospel accounts.44 Kilby's criticism is well aimed, however, in targeting Moltmann's uni- vocal predication of terms to the divine and human life. Moltmann nei- ther develops a theory of divine predication that helps distinguish be- tween his literal and figurative or metaphorical use of terms, nor does he often introduce distinctions, such as apophatic or cataphatic predi- cation, to help qualify how such imagery applies to God. To take Kilby's preferred example: Moltmann borrows the term perichoresis, which was originally created to describe the unique interpenetration of the two natures in Christ, and uses it freely to describe his ideal of human rela- tionships. When he does so, he often does not take the trouble to qual- ify the ways in which this language applies in a primary sense to the di- vine life and only metaphorically to our own. In the absence of such qualifications, Moltmann remains open to the charge of projectionism that Kilby among others levels against him.45 Even with the addition of such qualifications, the risk of idolatry, that is, of creating a trinitar- ian image of his own choosing, is real in Moltmann's social trinitarian theology. 44This, of course, does not answer all objections to Moltmann's scriptural hermeneutics that support his doctrine of the Trinity. Biblical theologian Richard Bauckham, e.g., has raised significant critiques of Moltmann's interpretations of Scripture in light of New Tes- tament scholarship. See Richard Bauckham, The Theology offiirgen Moltmann (Edinburgh: T &amp; T Clark, 1995), esp. pp. 179-82. 45 Kilby (n. 14 above), pp. 435-37. For similar criticisms, see Randolph E. Otto, "The Use and Abuse of Perichoresis in Recent Theology," Scottish Journal of Theology 54, no. 3 (2001): 366-84. 189</page><page sequence="14">The Journal of Religion II. CHRISTIAN LIFE IN THE SPIRIT OF TRINITARIAN FELLOWSHIP If Moltmann's God of trinitarian fellowship is a communion of boundless self-giving, a God who at once is "free in love" and "frees in love," how do human beings come to participate in this freedom of faith? What are the fruits of this freedom in the Christian life? In order to explore these ques- tions I turn first to Moltmann's theological anthropology-what he de- scribes as human being's messianic destiny as imago Trinitatis and the path toward its consummation. This creation-redemption schema will provide the basis for a closer look at how human beings are freed and formed in grace to engage in practices of fellowship with one another. At this junc- ture we will engage Torrance's twin objections that Moltmann unduly el- evates the human being's role in the economy of salvation at the expense of the gratuity of God's action on behalf of humankind. A. Human Fellowship as Imago Dei The cornerstone of Moltmann's theological anthropology is his reinter- pretation of the classical notion of the imago Dei. Moltmann departs from the notion of an ideal primordial state or property that has been either damaged or lost in the Fall and then restored through grace. He recon- figures this mythic story of paradise lost and regained into a messianic narrative, one in which the imago Dei appears as the human being's escha- tological destiny instead of as its lost origin. "In the messianic light of the gospel," he writes, "the human being's likeness to God appears as a his- torical process with an eschatological termination; it is not a static condi- tion. Being human means becoming human in this process."'' Within this messianic narrative the human being as imago Dei appears in the tensive state of already and not yet; the human being's likeness to God is both an ever-present reality and an unrealized promise. For Moltmann, the imago Dei is not an anthropological capacity that dis- tinguishes human beings from the rest of creation. It is a theological cate- gory. As such, the nature of God's being and God's "special resolve" in cre- ating humankind guides Moltmann's reconstruction of the concept.47 As I argued above, the essence of the trinitarian God is "to be free in love" and "to free in love." Viewed in these terms, God's eternal purpose in creating humankind is to establish a relationship to another who can receive and respond freely to the trinitarian God's gift of love. Accordingly, Moltmann construes the imago Dei as the human being's capacity to become such a 46Jiirgen Moltmann, God in Creation: A New Theology of Creation and the Spirit of God, The Gif- ford Lectures 1984-85, trans. Margaret Kohl (San Francisco: HarperCollins, 1985), p. 227. 47 Ibid., p. 217. 190</page><page sequence="15">Moltmann on Trinitarian Praxis counterpart. In his words, "men and women are beings who correspond to God, beings who can give the seeking love of God the sought-for re- sponse, and who are intended to do just that. ... The human being is the Other who resembles God (Ps. 8:5)."48 Although the whole of the created order springs forth gratuitously from God's infinite self-giving, human be- ings are unique in their capacity to reciprocate (albeit in a creaturely manner) this divine self-giving. They are singularly destined to become the beloved Other, the trinitarian God's sought-after covenant partner whose fulfillment is found in returning this trinitarian love in freedom. Moltmann describes the imago Dei in even more precise theological terms as an analogia relationis. Following the lead of Bonhoeffer and Barth, he contrasts this "analogy of relations" to "an analogy of substance," the latter of which focuses on a singular attribute inherent in human beings, such as the rational soul or the will.49 Instead of fixing the likeness to God in the individual's possession of such a capacity, Moltmann defines the im- age in terms of relationships that mirror the trinitarian life. As imago Dei human beings not only respond in love to God's gift of fellowship but are also blessed with the possibility of expressing ecstatic and passionate fel- lowship toward one another. In Moltmann's words, "As the image of God on earth, human beings correspond first of all to the relationship of God to themselves and to the whole of creation. But they also correspond to the inner relationships of God to himself-to the eternal, inner love of God which expresses and manifests itself in creation.""5 In the terms that I in- troduced above, human beings consummate their messianic destiny as imago Dei when they are "free in love" and become those who themselves "free in love." Two aspects of this imago Dei anthropology are especially significant. First and foremost, this analogy of trinitarian relations depends strictly on a gift of grace rather than on an innate capacity of human beings. What- ever likeness or correspondences to the trinitarian fellowship become manifest in and among human beings come as a response to God's prior self-giving; all of our acts of self-giving love, however much our own, are offered in response to God's first initiating a relationship with us. Once conceived in terms of an assymetrical divine-human relation, the imago Dei can never be taken as being a property that human beings can either possess or lose. It remains always and everywhere a gift that God offers freely and human beings receive in gratitude ever anew. 48 Ibid., pp. 77-78. 49Ibid., pp. 219-20. See Bonhoeffer's earlier discussion of this analogy of relation in Diet- rich Bonhoeffer, Creation and Fall: A Theological Interpretation of Genesis 1-3, trans. J. C. Fletcher (London: SCM Press, 1959), pp. 36-37. 50o Moltmann, God in Creation, p. 77. 191</page><page sequence="16">The Journal of Religion Second, Moltmann's "analogy of relations" guarantees that the imago Dei is a social or interpersonal reality. Although each individual can be spoken of as imago Dei, insofar as she or he responds personally to the trinitarian fellowship in love and thanksgiving, human beings only fully realize their messianic destiny as imago Trinitatis in their relationships with one another.5 Just as the divine persons only exist in and through their ecstatic relationships of self-giving communion with one another, so anal- ogously, human beings only become who they are called to be in and through their fellowship with others. For this reason, sociality and right relationships with one's neighbors belong to the essence of what it means to be human: "From the very outset human beings are social beings.... They are gregarious beings and only develop their personalities in fel- lowship with other people. Consequently they can only relate to them- selves if, and to the extent in which, other people relate to them. The iso- lated individual and the solitary subject are deficient modes of being human, because they fall short of likeness to God. Nor does the person take priority over the community. On the contrary, person and commu- nity are two sides of one and the same life process."52 Although social rela- tionships are constitutive of true personhood in Moltmann's trinitarian anthropology, this does not mean that the individual disappears in a form of collectivism or that an individual's identity is simply the sum of his or her social relations. Rather, what Moltmann's social trinitarian anthropol- ogy prescribes is the inseparability of personal identity and sociality, so that self-relation and social relations come into existence together. Just as the unity among the trinitarian persons does not take precedence over the distinction among the three persons, so, too, the human community does not take priority over its individual members. B. Salvation Revisited Moltmann recasts salvation in messianic and social trinitarian categories along the lines of his reconfigured notion of the imago Dei. He departs from the Western forensic model of salvation that focuses on the forgive- ness of sins and the restoration of a state of original perfection that was ei- ther perverted or utterly lost through sin. In its place Moltmann adopts a model of salvation long familiar from the Eastern Church Fathers-sal- vation as deification or theosis. Here salvation is understood as a gradual process of transfiguration and glorification into a "new creation."" This new creation fulfills the original created destiny of humankind, namely, to 51Moltmann, The Spirit of Life (n. 16 above), p. 221. 52 Moltmann, God in Creation, p. 223. 5 Ibid., p. 229. 192</page><page sequence="17">Moltmann on Trinitarian Praxis become imago Dei. Moltmann adapts this patristic model of deification within the horizon of his messianic and social doctrine of the Trinity. Sal- vation becomes a messianic process in which human beings are "accepted into the cycle of divine relationships and the mutual indwellings of the Fa- ther, the Son and the Spirit. Their mutual indwelling includes men and women: ... The indwelling is also the mystery of the new creation, 'That God may be all in all' (I Cor. 15:28)."15 Moltmann stresses that the Son and the Holy Spirit together accomplish this new creation. The process of regeneration begins with the Holy Spirit's gift of fellowship to human beings. In a bold interpretation of Rom. 5:8, Moltmann portrays the Spirit's fellowship with human beings as analogous to the perichoresis that exists among the trinitarian persons. He writes: "In the love of God which is 'poured out' in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, God himself is 'in us' and we ourselves are 'in God'... we ex- perience the reciprocal perichoresis of God and ourselves."55 Just as the divine persons dwell in one another through their reciprocal acts of self- giving love, so, too, human beings through the gift of the Holy Spirit can be said to dwell in the midst of this life-giving love. In Moltmann's words, the Spirit imbues each individual with a "vitality" or "love of life."56 He or she participates in God's unconditional love of all living things and dis- covers a "passion for life" and "a new delight in living in the joy of God."57 Through the Holy Spirit's vivifying presence, human beings are drawn into intimate fellowship with the Son. Moltmann describes individuals as becoming the brothers and sisters of Christ and in this way being adopted into the Son's unique loving relationship with the Father.58 This mediated participation in the divine fellowship empowers human beings to respond to the divine self-giving with their own acts of love; they become imago Christi, or true children of God. Moreover, by responding with such acts of love, human beings glorify the Father along with the Son and the Holy Spirit and become themselves the glory of God. In so doing they move to- ward the messianic goal of new creation-their coinherence or perma- nent indwelling in the heart of trinitarian fellowship.59 "4 Moltmann, "The Inviting Unity of the Triune God" (n. 20 above), p. 87. 55 Moltmann, The Spirit of Life, p. 195. On this point Kilby's critique of Moltmann's impre- cise use of trinitarian concepts seems quite justified, especially since the term perichoresis is used to describe an attribute unique to the Trinity, namely, how three can be one. For a fuller assessment of Moltmann's use of this analogy of perichoresis in the human sphere, see Joy Ann McDougall, "A Room of One's Own? Perichoresis as Analogy for the God-Human Rela- tionship," in Der Raum: Seine theologischen Dimensionen, ed. Carmen Rivuzumwami (Neuen- kirchen-Vluyn: Neuenkirchener Verlag, 2002). 56Ibid., p. 86. 57 Ibid., p. 178. 58 Moltmann, "The Inviting Unity of the Triune God," p. 87. 59Ibid. 193</page><page sequence="18">The Journal of Religion At this point we can see how the Spirit lends a creative and liberative dy- namic to the Christian life. The Holy Spirit knits human beings into the most intimate fellowship with the Trinity, a fellowship in which human be- ings are gathered into the midst of the life-giving and liberating love of God. In Moltmann's words, "people are raised above earth and heaven, life and death, present and future, to God himself, and participate in his creative freedom ... [the believer] lives in the free space of God's creative possibilities, and partakes of them.""6 Through the gift of the Spirit, hu- man beings are granted that very same creative freedom which poured forth in the Trinity's original creation of the world. This creative freedom unfolds in the cardinal fruits of the Spirit, in faith, love, and hope. The first dimension is "liberating faith" or "freedom as subjectivity."''61 Here faith's freedom is not limited to the classical Western notion of the forgiveness of sins; it also represents new agency-the liberation for new life. The individual believer experiences him- or herself as no longer de- termined by or in bondage to his or her past and, therefore, as free to ac- tualize new creative possibilities in his or her life. The second dimension is "liberating love" or "freedom as sociality."62 Here the gift of creative free- dom moves beyond the boundaries of the individual to create fellowship between persons through their mutual love for one another. In keeping with his social trinitarian framework, Moltmann views such loving partic- ipation in the life of one another as essential to life in the Spirit. Just as the trinitarian persons consummate their freedom through love of one an- other, so, too, human beings consummate their personal freedom in and through mutual love for one another. The third fruit of the Spirit is "liberating hope" or "freedom as future."'" Here the Spirit infuses human beings with a messianic hope-what Molt- mann terms a "creative passion for the possible. ... It is directed towards the future, the future of the coming God."6' Human beings enjoy the promise and a foretaste of the fellowship of the coming trinitarian kingdom. The believer experiences joy at the advent of the trinitarian kingdom, and yet she is also filled with restlessness over the broken aspects of the world. This dialectical experience of "already and not yet" awakens in human beings a messianic impulse toward transformation of the present state of human re- lations and social structures. Inspired with the hope for the coming king- dom, human beings envision creative possibilities for trinitarian fellowship in the world and are empowered to work toward their consummation. 6 Moltmann, The Spirit of Life, p. 121. 6" Ibid., pp. 114-15. 62 Ibid., pp. 117-18. 63 Ibid., p. 119. 64 Ibid. 194</page><page sequence="19">Moltmann on Trinitarian Praxis C. The Messianic Praxis of Trinitarian Fellowship as an Analogy of Grace With Moltmann's messianic schema of human creation and salvation now in full sight, we can better grasp the social trinitarian pattern to the Christian life-what I term the "messianic praxis of trinitarian fellowship." Through the fellowship of the Spirit, human beings not only gain the freedom to re- spond to their triune God with praise and thanksgiving, but they begin to respond with this very same life-giving love to one another. They are simul- taneously freed and formed in grace to create lives of fellowship that reflect the boundless self-giving, the ecstatic generosity of the trinitarian life. Throughout this process of sanctification, loving fellowship with God and with one's neighbors are intertwined gifts of the Spirit. The Spirit gathers human beings into the trinitarian communion only to send them forth into the world to undertake a creative discipleship that is patterned after the Spirit's own life-giving and liberating fellowship. The deeper an individual's communion with his or her trinitarian God, the more ecstatically he or she will go forth into the world to create fellowship with others.65 In sum, the Spirit gives rise to a Christian praxis that unites personal flourishing and so- cial transformation, and intimate fellowship with God and with one another. In light of this analysis, there is little evidence then to support Tor- rance's contention that Moltmann compromises the gratuity of grace in the Christian life. As I have argued above, the consummation of the hu- man being's messianic identity as imago Trinitatis is mediated through the reciprocal agency of Christ and the Spirit. Whatever correspondences to the trinitarian life develop among human beings, these are Spirit-filled works of fellowship. They are analogies of grace and not as Torrance sug- gests "a natural human response or innate capacity."''66 Moreover, Molt- mann's model of sanctification does not blur the ontological distinction between the trinitarian being and human history. Although Moltmann's messianic schema of creation-redemption links divine and human histo- ries inextricably with one another, Moltmann maintains the sovereignty of Trinitarian fellowship throughout this history. Trinitarian fellowship is not simply the consummation of the human community's perfection, and thus a messianic goal yet to be realized, but is the source of the creative freedom that empowers the human community's transfiguration. III. THE RETURN OF TRINITARIAN PRAXIS? Let us turn finally to consider Cunningham's critique that Moltmann's social trinitarian program is not practical enough. Does it fail to offer a 65 See ibid., p. 221. 6Torrance (n. 13 above), p. 313. 195</page><page sequence="20">The Journal of Religion "concrete doctrine" and "practical theory" that can address the pressing concerns of contemporary Christian communities? In this context I will consider what this praxis of trinitarian fellowship might look today-what forms of human relationships belong to life in the Spirit of trinitarian fel- lowship, and do such relationships present a prophetic challenge and source of messianic hope for the human community? A. Open Friendship as Praxis of Trinitarian Fellowship The reader who opens Moltmann's Messianic Dogmatics anticipating a de- tailed social trinitarian rule of faith is bound for disappointment. No- where does Moltmann prescribe a set of distinctive trinitarian practices for the Christian life. As I argued above, Moltmann's social trinitarian the- ology shapes Christian praxis indirectly, by utilizing trinitarian fellowship as a divine analogy to guide human relationships. Moltmann employs this analogy, however, widely in his theology. He uses divine fellowship as a theological norm in relationships as diverse as the sensual love between two persons, the bonds that join members in a church congregation, and the structures of political governance.67 In all such relationships, Molt- mann applies a flexible theological rule: they should involve reciprocal self-giving and acceptance of another person. True fellowship is founded, in his words, on "openness to one another, sharing with one another and respect for one another. It is the reciprocal communication of all that one has and is."68 Just as in the fellowship among the trinitarian persons, so, too, all true human relationships are based on a dynamic of self-donation and self-differentiation. They involve giving oneself fully to another in or- der to form bonds of community, all the while creating the free space in which individual identity is both recognized and flourishes. In other words, trinitarian fellowship does not commend homogeneous human communities that erase personal differences. Rather, it fosters human fel- lowships of "diversity in unity" in which individual potentials are realized and differences may abound.69 One practice that helps specify how human beings embody this rule of trinitarian fellowship in the Christian life is "open friendship." "Open friendship" is essentially Moltmann's model of Christian hospitality, and it recurs throughout his works as the ideal for how Christians should engage others in the world. In The Spirit of Life, Moltmann presents his most de- tailed theological account of "open friendship." There he introduces it 67 For these examples, see Moltmann, The Spirit of Life (n. 16 above), pp. 248-67, and The Trinity and the Kingdom (n. 1 above), pp. 191-202. 68 Moltmann, "'The Fellowship of the Holy Spirit': On Pneumatology" (n. 10 above), p. 57. 69 Moltmann, The Spirit of Life, p. 219. 196</page><page sequence="21">Moltmann on Trinitarian Praxis pointedly as a "social experience of God," as one of the central ways in which human beings experience the love of God through their sociality with one another." Moltmann initially borrows his definition of "open friendship" from Kantian moral theory. Friendship, he explains in Kant's terms, is a personal relationship that combines "respect for the other per- son's freedom with deep affection for him or her as a person."" Despite the nontrinitarian origin of his definition of "open friendship," Moltmann develops its meaning in such a way that it corresponds to the personal relations that constitute the trinitarian life of fellowship. "Open friendship" depends equally on the desire to share oneself fully in the life of another individual and on the recognition of the other person's dif- ference or individuality. Moreover, "open friendship" is predicated upon perfect reciprocity and equality among human beings. A person neither appropriates nor possesses another, nor do the two become subject to one another. Rather each creates the space for the other person's freedom to emerge. In Moltmann's more poetic terms, "Friends throw open the free spaces of life for one another, and accompany one another in sympathy and immense interest."72 Though Moltmann fails to make this point explicit, the person and work of Jesus Christ ontologically link "open friendship" and trinitarian fellow- ship. We saw in the earlier discussion of the trinitarian history of God that human beings come to know the essence of trinitarian fellowship, the infi- nite self-giving love of the Other, uniquely through the person of Jesus Christ. So here too, the very same self-giving love of the Other takes on vis- ible form in the "open friendship" that Jesus extends to all persons, espe- cially those at the margins of society-the sinners, the poor, and the out- cast: "[Jesus] celebrated the messianic feast with the people who had been thrust out of society. In inviting joy, he opened himself for them, and re- spected both them and the poor, as the first children of the divine grace that creates everything afresh. He recognized their dignity as people. He bridged the gulf of their self-isolation, and did away with the social preju- dice under which they suffered. Through speech and gesture, the divine 'friend of sinners and tax collectors' spread the encouraging and support- ive atmosphere of open friendship among men and women.""7 For Molt- mann, Jesus' ministry exemplifies perfectly the reciprocal dynamic of 7 Ibid., p. 255; cf. ibid., pp. 255-59. 7Ibid., p. 255. Although Moltmann does not explicitly cite Kant as his source for this def- inition in The Spirit of Life, he does so in his earlier discussions of "open friendship." Com- pare, e.g., Jiirgen Moltmann, "Aristotelian and Christian Concepts of Friendship," in The Changing Face of Friendship, ed. Leroy S. Rouner (Notre Dame, Ind.: University of Notre Dame Press, 1994), pp. 29-42, here p. 30. 2 Moltmann, The Spirit of Life, p. 256. 73Ibid., p. 258. 197</page><page sequence="22">The Journal of Religion affection and respect, self-giving and self-distinction that characterize "open friendship." Jesus gives fully of himself by entering with compassion and active solidarity into others' situations; he creates the free space to ac- cept another person's differences and to respect their uniqueness. More- over, Jesus offers this open friendship to all human beings not out of moral duty, but out of overflowing joy, the very same ecstatic generosity that con- stitutes the trinitarian life of fellowship. B. The Promise of Open Friendship One would certainly need to consider many more Christian practices, such as those of prayer or Sabbath keeping, in order to see fully how trini- tarian theology shapes the Christian life. "Open friendship" does provide, however, a good vantage point for viewing the promising practical impli- cations of Moltmann's social trinitarian theology. First and foremost, "open friendship" recasts the classical Reformed tenet of "the freedom of the Christian" in communal terms as "a freedom for and with another person." In so doing, this social trinitarian model of Christian freedom contests the Enlightenment ideal of freedom as indi- vidual liberty and the "right to self-determination."74 Moltmann incisively criticizes this modern archetype of human freedom as autonomy, by pointing to how it atomizes human society into a collection of solitary and competing individuals. In modernity's social contract, each individual is perceived as the limit of another's freedom. At its best, such a model of hu- man freedom isolates individuals from one another by engendering fierce competition for common resources and property. At its worst, it leads to the subjugation of the weak by the dominant and the dissolution of all true bonds of community.75 "Open friendship" provides a powerful antidote to this individualistic concept of freedom as self-transcendence that triumphed in modern the- ological anthropology. In contrast to the modern concept of freedom as freedom from the web of social relationships with others, the freedom of "open friendship" is found in the ties that bind diverse persons together as a community. In Moltmann's words, it is a "communicative freedom": a freedom that emerges in reciprocal giving and receiving, in mutual recog- nition and acceptance.76 Moreover, in "open friendship":' personal identity flourishes rather than being sacrificed. Here the antinomy between the freedom of the person and that of his or her neighbor is overcome in a life 74 Ibid., p. 115.

Just as in the individual's fellowship with the Holy Spirit, so, too, open friendship offers "both the love that binds and the freedom which allows everything to arrive at itself, in its own unique nature."78 The second promising dimension of "open friendship" lies in its charge to self-giving love of the Other. As we have seen above, self-giving love is essentially christological praxis; it is patterned after the ministry and the proclamation, the life and the self-donation of Christ. On my reading of Moltmann's christology, this self-giving love of the Other manifests itself in a variety of relationships and actions. For example, a believer can express "open friendship" through compassionate fellow- ship-by participating so fully in the trials or joys of others that she pro- vides companionship in their midst. In other situations, self-giving love of the Other takes the form of an active solidarity with persons on the margins. Here "open friendship" might mean resistance against unjust structures and relationships that create social exclusion in the first place; it may mean risking spiritual or physical suffering on behalf of another. Finally, self-giving love of the Other may take the form of a restorative forgiveness that heals broken relationships and welcomes the person who is isolated through personal or collective guilt back into community with others. What binds all these forms of self-giving love of the Other together is their inclusivity, their acceptance of all others in their diversity. Moltmann underscores this mandate to inclusive fellowship by juxtaposing "open friendship" with the Greek concept of friendship (philia), in which friend- ship is restricted to those who are identical in nature or rank, for exam- ple, in gender or social status. In contrast, "open friendship" reaches be- yond those who are like us toward those who are radically "Other." Just as Jesus welcomes all persons with the boundless mercy and life-giving love of the kingdom's fellowship, so, too, the Christian is charged to practice such "open friendship" in the world. Wherein lies the source of messianic hope in these diverse expres- sions of"open friendship"? Through acts of creative and passionate fel- lowship, "open friendship" breaks the bondage of human exclusion and weaves new bonds of community in its place. Regardless of an in- dividual's situation, whether she or he is the victim or the perpetrator of broken fellowship, the practice of "open friendship" restores an in- dividual to the embrace of community. In so doing, such self-giving love of the Other dramatically overturns human economies of even ex- 7 See Moltmann, God for a Secular Society, p. 158. 78Moltmann, The Spirit of Life, p. 220. 199</page><page sequence="24">The Journal of Religion change. In "open friendship," human love is neither simply returned in kind nor meted out in equal portions. Rather, self-giving love is re- turned with the overflowing abundance that characterizes the life- giving love of trinitarian fellowship. With trinitarian fellowship as its measure, the circle of open friendship widens to include all persons and notjust those who resemble one another in social status, gender, or ethnicity. It is truly a boundless self-giving that is without reserve or conditions. The practice of "open friendship" might not provide the prescriptive rules for the Christian life that Cunningham and others are looking for today from trinitarian theology, for example, rules for how to resolve conflicts over liturgy, the church's social witness, or its stance on personal ethics."79 Nonetheless, the practice of "open friendship" demonstrates how Moltmann's messianic vision of trinitarian fellowship can descend from the realm of abstract ideals to become "concrete doctrine." As I have argued above, trinitarian fellowship gives rise to a distinctive under- standing of the cardinal fruits of the Spirit-of faith, hope, and love. These gifts of the Spirit provide a broad but sturdy theological frame- work for the Christian life that is built upon the inseparable pillars of love of God and love of neighbor. As a concrete expression of these two loves, "open friendship" leads the believer into the footsteps of Christ-toward imitating the boundless hospitality that Jesus shared with all those he en- countered and particularly with those on the margins of society. This boundless hospitality presents believers with concrete possibilities for emancipatory transformation of the world into the messianic kingdom of fellowship. C. Speaking of Sin against the Spirit of Trinitarian Fellowship Throughout this essay I have argued that a constructive interpretation of Moltmann's works belies many of the criticisms that have been raised against his social trinitarian theology. To conclude, I would like to redi- rect Cunningham's concern over the impracticality of Moltmann's social 7"These examples are drawn from Cunningham's own trinitarian theology, These Three Are One (n. 11 above), in which he proposes a doctrine of the Trinity that can address these practical concerns of the contemporary church. For a more tensive and ambiguous rela- tionship between Christian beliefs and practices, see Amy Plantinga Pauw's and Kathryn Tan- ner's essays in Practicing Theology: Beliefs and Practices in Christian Life, ed. Miroslav Volf and Dorothy C. Bass (Grand Rapids, Mich.: Eerdmans, 2002), pp. 33-48 and 228-242, respec- tively. Pauw and Tanner argue along similar lines that the relationship between Christian doctrine and practices should be one of "flexible integrity" rather than "unbending rigid- ity" (p. 42). They caution against tying too tight a connection between the two, which can mask a community's distortion of its practices and belie the "improvisional and ad hoc" na- ture of social practices (p. 230). 200</page><page sequence="25">Moltmann on Trinitarian Praxis trinitarian theology by drawing attention to an issue that has been over- looked by Moltmann's interpreters, namely, his lack of a robust doctrine of sin.so In all fairness to Moltmann, the notion of sin does not disappear alto- gether from his messianic trinitarian theology. In The Spirit of Life he intro- duces a broad category of sin, which represents all the death-dealing forces that deny the Spirit as the wellspring of life. Sin negates or defies the Spirit of creation and new creation-its "vitality" and "love of life.""' True to his Reformed tradition, Moltmann develops this notion of sin most fully within his doctrine ofjustification. There he is anxious to reform the classical un- derstanding of God's righteousness that justifies all sinners, on the grounds that such "a universal concept of sin" can too easily become an "excuse for specific, practical guilt."82 In place of a generic imputation of all persons as justified sinners, Moltmann introduces a differentiated view of God's right- eousness that offers justification to the perpetrators of sin and justice for its victims. The Spirit of Life frees the perpetrators of sin from the bondage of their guilt and repression, at the same time that she liberates sin's victims by creating possibilities for new life.83 Moltmann also expands the classical doc- trine's focus on individual sin to include structural sin, those institutional- ized forms of injustice in which individuals experience themselves as both caught and complicit. Here the Spirit of Life manifests itself as a "rectifying" righteousness that "destabilizes" these unjust and violent social structures and transforms them into patterns of fellowship.84 Despite these significant innovations to his doctrine, Moltmann's ha- martiology does not correspond fully to his social trinitarian framework for the Christian life.85 Sin appears more as a cosmic force against life rather than as a personal or systemic distortion of trinitarian fellowship. For example, Moltmann has not used his social trinitarian framework to analyze either individual or corporate sin as forms of un-faith, un-hope, 80 In his article "Whatever Happened to the Doctrine of Sin?" Theology Today 50, no. 2 (1993): 169-78, David Kelsey offers one of the few critical discussions of the doctrine of sin in Moltmann's theology. Kelsey includes Moltmann within his typology of modern theologies of sin under the liberationist paradigm as an analysis of oppression or "unjust societal self- contradiction" (p. 173). Although I share Kelsey's concern for a larger doctrine of sin in Molt- mann's theology, Kelsey's assessment seems a bit shortsighted insofar as it takes into account neither Moltmann's staurological interpretation of sin in The Crucified God nor the develop- ment of his doctrine in The Spirit of Life. 81Moltmann, The Spirit of Life (n. 16 above), p. 86. 82Ibid., p. 126. 83Compare ibid., pp. 129-38. "8Ibid., p. 143. 85 In his God in Creation (n. 46 above), pp. 233-34, Moltmann touches briefly on an under- standing of sin as a "perversion of the human being's relationship with God" (p. 233). How- ever, he does not develop this concept in social trinitarian categories here or in his later dis- cussion of the doctrines ofjustification and sanctification in The Spirit of Life. 201</page><page sequence="26">The Journal of Religion and un-love. Missing furthermore is an in-depth analysis of the debilitat- ing effects of sin upon human beings' relationships or of the remedy for these effects, for example, in words of confession and lamentation, acts of forgiveness and repentance.86 In my view, these undeveloped aspects of the Christian doctrine of sin contribute significantly to the utopianism that dogs Moltmann's social trinitarian theology. Without a robust doc- trine of sin, Moltmann's claims on behalf of the practical significance of his doctrine appear indeed optimistic, as if to suggest that once its social trini- tarian norms are articulated, they can be realized. Moreover, this disjunc- tion between Moltmann's theology of sin and his trinitarian theology of grace collapses the classic Reformed dialectic of sin and grace, which serves both to remind the community of its susceptibility to self-deception and to spur it on to further transformation. Although Moltmann has not developed a doctrine of sin in social trini- tarian categories, let me suggest a couple of constructive theological rea- sons for why it is salutary to do so. First of all, speaking of sin as a distor- tion or separation from trinitarian fellowship draws into sharp relief that sin is a theological problem. At its deepest level sin is not only a transgres- sion against either a moral or social code but also a breach and betrayal of our fellowship with God the Father through the Son in the Spirit. Once we recall that the Spirit of fellowship is the creative passion that creates and sustains all of creation in existence, the dire consequences of such a rupture become strikingly evident. Sin amounts to an unraveling of our personal identity-a turning away from the life-giving energy that holds all things in life. Against the horizon of divine fellowship, sin emerges in all its violence and destructiveness as an uprooting of our most funda- mental relationship, what British theologian Mary Grey has aptly called our "structural decreation" or "unmaking of the world."87 Speaking about sin as ruptured fellowship not only highlights the de- structiveness of sin, but it also provides a suggestive metaphor in which to describe the disparate manifestations of sinfulness among human be- ings. For example, broken fellowship encompasses both the classical Au- gustinian notion of sin as "pride" as well as contemporary feminist re- 86The confines of this essay do not permit me to explore fully the source of this disjunction in Moltmann's mature theology. However, one of the main roots of this tension is that he re- tains aspects of the Western forensic model of salvation that he learned from his Reformed teachers, H. J. Weber, E. Wolf, and E. Kaisemann, in his doctrine ofjustification. He grafts these elements into his new paradigm of salvation as deification, which he borrows from the Eastern Orthodox tradition. Compare his reference to the Reformed doctrine of justifi- cation in Moltmann, The Spirit of Life, p. 327. On the blending of these two models of salva- tion in Moltmann's mature theology, cf. McDougall, The Pilgrimage of Love (n. 42 above), pp. 236-37. 87Mary Grey, "Falling into Freedom: Searching for New Interpretations of Sin in a Secular Society," Scottish Journal of Theology 47, no. 2 (1994): 223-43, here 241. 202</page><page sequence="27">Moltmann on Trinitarian Praxis constructions of sin as "self-loss" or "lack of self-esteem.""8 In the former case, the egotistic self who instrumentalizes or dominates over others dis- torts the reciprocal self-giving of trinitarian fellowship. In the latter, the self who threatens to dissolve in and through oppressive relationships with others also distorts the gift of trinitarian fellowship that calls one to proper self-relation as well as self-giving. Further, both of these distor- tions of human fellowship are intertwined with the loss of fellowship with the Trinity. Just as faith in God and love of neighbor are intertwined fruits of the Holy Spirit, so, too, sin as ruptured fellowship can be understood as the simultaneous rupture of one's relationship with God and one's fel- low human beings. My challenge here to develop a more robust trinitarian theology of sin might appear to contradict the messianic trajectory of Moltmann's vision of life in the Spirit, a life aimed toward the regeneration of the human be- ing as imago trinitatis. However, my point is not to cast a pessimistic gloom over the human condition that would rob either the individual believer or the Christian community of the freedom and the responsibility for emancipatory action. I am not suggesting that sin can create such an un- dertow in human existence that it becomes fruitless to speak of transfor- mation in the Christian life. On the contrary, as Calvin and others in the Reformed tradition remind us, the true purpose of speaking of sin within the realm of grace is "to edify the faithful.""9 Sin talk is not intended to de- moralize but rather to strengthen one's faith in the fellowship offered in the Spirit and, even more, to inspire human beings with the passion and emancipatory vision to repair the broken fellowships in their midst. In Rebecca Chopp's words, a large doctrine of sin can be "an act of grace":90 "A discourse about sin is in itself a resistance to injustice and the expres- sion of the desire for human flourishing, for correcting all that is false, distorted, depraved."9' In this light, speaking about sin against the spirit of trinitarian fellowship would help disclose the distortions and rout out the forces of destruction that stand in the way of true fellowship between God and human beings. Speaking robustly about sin would serve as prophetic and messianic discourse to hasten "the return of Trinitarian praxis"-of drawing all things into deepening fellowship with God and one another.
