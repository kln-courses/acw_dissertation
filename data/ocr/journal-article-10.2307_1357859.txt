<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Bible Unearthed: A Rejoinder ISRAEL FINKELSTEIN Institute of Archaeology Tel Aviv University P.O.B. 39040 Ramat Aviv, Tel Aviv 69978 Israel fink2@post.tau.ac.il NEIL ASHER SILBERMAN Ename Center for Public Archaeology 13-15 Abdijstraat B-9700 Oudenaarde Belgium neil.silberman@enamecenter.org illiam Dever has recently published a re- view article of our book The Bible Un- earthed (2001a). It is our view that Dever either misunderstood the book, or misrepresented it in certain important respects. We will present the rea- sons for our position by citing Dever's own words (in italics) and responding to them (in regular font). To make it easier for the reader to follow this rebut- tal, we have divided our citations into two major categories, each set in the order in which they ap- pear in Dever's review article. CATEGORY #1: PROBLEMS OF FACT AND INTERPRETATIONS OF HISTORY "The story of 'Biblical Israel' found in the Deu- teronomistic history-the books of Joshua through Kings-is 'survival' literature, produced by ortho- dox, nationalist reform parties during the Assyrian crisis in the brief reign of Josiah, late in Judah's his- tory" (2001a: 67). The citation above comes from Dever's critical summary of our book. Josiah ascended the throne in Jerusalem in 639 and died in 609 B.C.E. Most schol- ars have argued that the Assyrians withdrew from Palestine a few years before the death of Ashurban- ipal in 631 B.C.E., and that from the very beginning of his reign, Josiah was free to conduct his own in- dependent policies (e.g., Cross and Freedman 1953; Noth 1958: 272-73; Spalinger 1978: 49-51; Miller and Hayes 1986: 381-85). Na'aman (1991: 33-41) proposed that Assyria withdrew from Palestine a bit later, in the 620s B.C.E. In any event, in the days of Josiah, the Assyrian crisis was over, or almost over. Most of his days-certainly as an adult-are there- fore post-Assyrian. The main power that Josiah had to deal with was Egypt, which, under the 26th (Saite) Dynasty, inherited the territories of Assyria in Pales- tine (Miller and Hayes 1986: 383-85, 388-90; Na'aman 1991). At least one chapter in The Bible Unearthed -the one dealing with the Exodus narra- tive- specifically deals, at length, with the Judah- Egypt confrontation in the days of Josiah. Thus Dever misconstrued the main point of the book, that the burst of activity of the Deuteronomistic movement was closely related to the withdrawal of Assyria from the region rather than to the "Assyrian crisis." It is also surprising to find exactly the same lan- guage, almost word for word, in his own recent book: "In short, the Deuteronomistic History as a compos- ite literary work is largely 'propaganda', designed to give theological legitimacy to a party of nationalis- tic ultra-orthodox reformers ..." (2001b: 100)! "The entire biblical tradition of ancient Israel, from the so-called Patriarchal era to the fall of Jerusalem, is thus more myth than history" (2001a: 67). This characterization of our view of biblical his- toriography is simply incorrect. The Bible Unearthed is divided into three parts. The first, dealing with the biblical narrative from the Patriarchs to the United Monarchy, indeed treats the biblical materials as more a myth than history (although we do not doubt the historicity of the monarchs of the tenth century or the existence of an Israelite territorial formation at that time, as we state repeatedly). But the other two parts of the book, dealing, respectively, with the history of Israel and Judah from the ninth century B.C.E. on, explicitly state, time and again, that the 63</page><page sequence="2">64 FINKELSTEIN AND SILBERMAN BASOR 327 outline of biblical history is accurate, often in detail, and almost always in broad outline. It is the biblical interpretation of events and the biblical explanation of their causation and meaning that we analyze in describing the kingdom of the Omrides, the history of Israel under Jeroboam II, and of Judah in the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.E. It is not (to dif- fer from Dever's views) just a matter of black and white-the Bible being either "true" or being an un- reliable "myth." "Yet on the other hand, if the authors are correct in their evaluation of the literary traditions in the Hebrew Bible, the Bible is largely fictitious-in effect a literary hoax that has fooled nearly every- one" (2001a: 69). This is a clear rhetorical overstatement, since De- ver himself denies the historicity of the Patriarchs, Exodus, and Conquest (2001b: 98-99, 121). On this issue, our disagreement with him is mainly about the historicity of a vast and powerful United Monar- chy-not the historicity of the Bible. "But Finkelstein and Silberman never seem to allow for any pre-Josianic strands in the literary tradition ... that is, older sources both oral and written" (2001a: 70). We quote from The Bible Unearthed: "Of course, no archaeologist can deny that the Bible contains legends, characters, and story fragments that reach far back in time" (2001: 23). And further: "Yet, there is no reason why the conquest narrative of the book of Joshua cannot also include folk memories and legends that commemorated this epoch-making transformation. They may offer us highly fragmen- tary glimpses of the violence, the passion, the eu- phoria at the destruction of cities and the horrible slaughter of their inhabitants that clearly occurred. Such searing experiences are not likely to have been totally forgotten, and indeed, their once vivid mem- ories, growing progressively vaguer over the centu- ries, may have become the raw material for a far more elaborate retelling. Thus there is no reason to suppose that the burning of Hazor by hostile forces, for example, never took place..." (2001: 91-92; see also 2001: 249 on the historical David). Finally, in the Exodus chapter (2001: 48-71), we referred at length to Redford's hypothesis (1987: 150-51), that the Exodus tradition may preserve echoes of the set- tlement of Semitic people in Egypt in the Middle Bronze Age and their expulsion from the Delta in the mid-second millennium B.C.E. "Finkelstein rehashes here his now-familiar no- tion that the majority of the Iron I hill country colo- nists were former local nomads, now in process of becoming sedentary. That is, early Israel was not, as I and others have maintained, a mixture of vari- ous groups, including long-settled agriculturalists and stock breeders, as well as perhaps urban refu- gees from the lowland towns and cities at the end of the Bronze Age. Yet, what is Finkelstein's evidence? He presents none" (2001a: 71). The evidence is presented at length in pages 111- 18 of the book. The data come from four sources: first, the map of early Iron I activity in the highlands, which discloses that the new settlers opted for the pasture-grain-growing niches; second, ethnographic or ethnohistorical comparison to similar shifts in the population of certain areas of the Near East in recent centuries (e.g., Lewis 1987); third, the layouts of at least some of the early Iron I sites, which point to a major pastoral component in the economy of the people who inhabited them; and fourth and most im- portant, oscillations in the settlement activity in the highlands between the fourth and the first millennia B.C.E., which reveal cycles in the demographic his- tory of the region. These cycles were not charac- terized by an influx of people from outside, but rather by shifts in economic strategies of the indigenous population. Dever proposed that Early Israel emerged from a shift of sedentary population from lowlands Late Bronze villages to highlands Iron I villages and farmsteads. This idea was originally proposed by Mendenhall (1962) and Gottwald (1979); Dever tried to provide it with archaeological substance. But the fact of the matter is that over thirty years of intensive work (digs and surveys) in the highlands failed to reveal any evidence for this hypothesis. De- ver's main contribution to the Mendenhall-Gottwald hypothesis was the introduction of old ideas of Al- bright (1949: 113), de Geus (1975), and others, who argued that the main factor behind the wave of settlement in the highlands in the Iron I was the ad- aptation of technological innovations, such as plas- tered water cisterns and terracing. In his view, these innovations demonstrate the technical skills of the settlers and point to their sedentary origin (e.g., De- ver 1993: 25-26). Yet, the large-scale surveys in the highlands from the late 1960s to the late 1980s have</page><page sequence="3">2002 THE BIBLE UNEARTHED: A REJOINDER 65 shown that plastering water cisterns and terracing were practiced in the highlands as early as the Mid- dle Bronze Age and probably even earlier (see al- ready Gophna and Porath 1972: 197, and at length in Finkelstein 1996a). "By his own estimates elsewhere, the 13th cen- tury B.C. population of the central hill country num- bered around 12,000, which by the 12th century B.C., however, swelled to around 21,000. Finkel- stein's own figures refute him, since he accepts the usual estimate that approximately 10% of ancient Palestine's population had always been pastoral no- mads" (2001a: 71). The three numbers cited by Dever are not ours. Regarding the first, Finkelstein's estimate for the population of the central hill country in the Late Bronze Age is approximately 6,000, not 12,000 (1996b: 246). Here is the relevant citation for the second number, Finkelstein's estimate of the early Iron I population in the central hill country: "If this proportion held true for the other regions that were inhabited early on... we could multiply the result- ant figures by our 'correction factors' to obtain a total of about 21,000 sedentary Israelites living west of the Jordan River around the mid-late 12th century B.C.E." (1988: 334). Finkelstein referred to the area "west of the Jordan River"; Dever understood cen- tral hill country. Needless to say, these data render Dever's calculations meaningless. As for the per- centage of nomads in ancient Palestine, here is the exact citation: "The only available statistical data on the share of groups of pastoralists in the Land of Israel come from the beginning of the 20th century CE, when the Bedouin are known to have constituted about 15% of the population. ... However, the ratio of sedentary dwellers to nomadic pastoralists could have varied widely, from an almost absolute seden- tary majority at times when the polity was well organized.., .to a preponderance of non-sedentary inhabitants, as in the Intermediate Bronze Age and perhaps in the Late Bronze and early Iron I periods as well" (Finkelstein 1988: 343). Had Dever taken into account works on demographic processes in the Middle East in recent centuries, such as Lewis's study (1987) on sedentary-pastoral oscillations in Jordan and Syria, he might have acknowledged that there is no "usual estimate" for the share of pastoral nomads in the population. In any event, for the sake of discussion, it is easy enough to show why even Dever's numbers are un- supportable. According to his estimate, thousands of people migrated from the lowlands to the highlands in the Late Bronze-Iron I transition. How could this possibly be? First, as we have mentioned above, the archaeology of the highlands does not show the slightest evidence for such a demographic process. Second, the depleted population of the Late Bronze lowlands (Finkelstein 1996b) could not have pro- pelled such a torrent of new settlers. The only region that had a "big enough" pool of Late Bronze people is the northern valleys; but surveys and excavations alike indicate clear continuity in the rural sector in this part of the country in the Late Bronze-Iron I transition (Finkelstein in press). "Of the 12th-century villages, which he himself did so much to put on the map, Finkelstein states: 'In fact, dozens of settlements that were linked with the early Israelites appeared in the hillcountry around that time'. . . Yet, elsewhere ... Finkelstein has vig- orously denied that we can identify the early high- land settlers as 'Israelites'. . ." (2001a: 71). Finkelstein has never denied that eventually, the Iron I settlers in the highlands crystallized into the Israelite ethnos, mainly because of the uninterrupted continuity in the occupation of most settlements into the period of the Iron II kingdoms of Israel and Judah (e.g., 1996a: 200). At the same time he has raised doubts whether the ethnic lines in the highlands in the early Iron I were as clear or as unambiguous as Dever presumes. He also questioned the ability of ar- chaeology to draw these lines. What we are saying may be a bit complex, but not contradictory. "Finkelstein has vigorously attacked my gener- ally positivist view, even rejecting my cautious term 'Proto-Israelite' for the hill country settlers" (2001 la: 71). Dever cites here Finkelstein's 1988 book The Archaeology of the Israelite Settlement, published before he (Dever) started writing about the rise of early Israel. And yet he ignores Finkelstein's later articles, where he indeed debated Dever's views, but accepted his term "proto-Israelite." Here is a cita- tion from Finkelstein's article in a book for which Dever himself wrote two chapters: "Two main ques- tions have dominated the research of the Iron Age I settlement transformation: 1. What was the origin of the Iron I villagers of the highlands of Cisjordan and the plateau of Transjordan-the proto-Israelites (Dever's term-1992a)..." (Finkelstein 1995: 349).</page><page sequence="4">66 FINKELSTEIN AND SILBERMAN BASOR 327 "I surveyed the lack of any archaeological evi- dence to support a historical 'Patriarchal era' long ago (Dever 1977). Here Finkelstein and Silberman are not really innovative-simply popularizing long- held scholarly views.. ." (2001a: 71, n. 15). First, we should check whether Dever's 2001a is a fair description of Dever 1977. Here is what he said then: ". . . the more we know of the historical and cultural frameworks of the Siedlungsgeschichte of the early West Semitic peoples, as well as of the ar- chaeological phases of Syria-Palestine in the Bronze Age, the more suitable the nucleus of the patriarchal traditions may fit into the second millennium B.C.E. It may even be possible to narrow the time-span somewhat.... The period.., .in which Palestine experienced major new increments of West Semitic ('Amorite') peoples is the MB IIA-B era.... To con- clude our discussion, it is well observed that our preference for the Middle Bronze Age for patriarchal backgrounds is due in part to the paucity of evidence at present for the Late Bronze Age" (1977: 117-20). Dever did not survey "the lack of any archaeological evidence to support a historical 'Patriarchal era'." It was Thompson (1974)! Dever 1977 did exactly the opposite of what Dever 2001a claims. We may be wrong in proposing that the Patriar- chal stories-mainly those in J-were put in writing in the seventh century B.C.E., but this view is defini- tely new. It takes the middle road between those who would date J to an earlier phase in monarchic times (e.g., Friedman 1999; McCarter and Hendel 1999) and those who would put it in the Exilic period in the sixth century (Van Seters 1975). Many scholars have suggested in the last three decades a close connec- tion between J and the Deuteronomistic History (see summaries with bibliographies in Whybray 1987: 221-35; de Pury and Romer 1989: 58-67; Roimer and de Pury 2000: 82-88), but as far as we know, we were the first to explicitly suggest that J is also closely connected to the ideology of Judah in the seventh century. "Finkelstein, though a prominent archaeologist and prolific author, is idiosyncratic, representing nei- ther the mainstream of Israeli or American archae- ological scholarship. On many of the crucial issues discussed in the present work (such as chronology; below), he stands virtually alone" (2001a: 68). "For thorough refutations of his [Finkelstein's] 'low chronology,' see, for instance, Dever 1997c; Mazar 1997; 1999; Zarzeki-Peleg 1997; and Ben- Tor and Ben-Ami 1998" (2001a: 68, n. 4 and refer- ences therein). Dever's charge that a viewpoint he disagrees with is not "mainstream" and that its proponent stands alone is not new for him. He made the same case with Manfred Bietak regarding the chronology of the Middle Bronze (1991: 77)-but a short while later was forced to concede defeat (1992b). Dever's "mainstream" theory was proven wrong, while Bie- tak's "stand alone" ideas have been widely accepted. What does "mainstream" mean for Dever? Seem- ingly, "mainstream" is the Albright-Yadin school, nowadays personified by Dever, at least in his own estimation. Regarding the debate on the dating of the Iron Age strata, we should wait for the verdict. For the time being, Dever enters the arena equipped with a biblical verse (I Kgs 9:15-1997; Dever 2001b: 131- 34, and see below) and Yadin's generation-old ideas (1958; 1970). In contrast, Finkelstein has presented a set of data from stratigraphic, historical, and sci- entific sources. And for the time being, the radiocar- bon results from Megiddo, Dor (Gilboa and Sharon 2001), and Rehov (Mazar 1999: 40-41; Mazar and Carmi 20011) seem to overpower Dever's straight- forward reading of the biblical material. We are not troubled by the idea of standing alone to defend a hypothesis we believe is supported by the evidence. But in order to set the record straight, we wish to provide an interim list of the supporters (or supporters in part) of the Low Chronology: Avitz-Singer (in Finkelstein and Singer-Avitz 2001); Fantalkin (2001, on Aegean-Levantine relationship in the early Iron II); Gilboa and Sharon (2001, on the Dor C14 dates); Herzog (2002, on the sites in the south); Knauf (2000a; 2000b); Mazar on the termi- nal date of the Megiddo VA-IVB horizon (Mazar and Carmi 2001: 1340); Miinger on the chronologi- cal evidence of Egyptian stamp-seal amulets (Miin- ger in press); Na'aman (2000, on the Philistine phase of the debate; 1997 on the conquests of Hazael; 2002: 22 on the date of construction of the Megiddo palaces); Niemann (1997: 263 in general; 1 The nine samples of charred grain from the destruction of Stratum C1--the contemporary of Stratum VA-IVB at Megiddo -were dated to 906-843 cal B.C.E. (1 sigma range) or to cal 916-832 B.C.E. (2 sigma range). Contra Mazar's summary, they fit the dating of Megiddo VA-IVB and its contemporaries to the first half of the 9th century rather than to the mid-10th century B.C.E.</page><page sequence="5">2002 THE BIBLE UNEARTHED: A REJOINDER 67 2000: 71-72 on Megiddo); Sass (in press, on the 11th- to 9th-century epigraphic evidence); Uehl- inger (1997: 102, n. 30); Ussishkin and Woodhead (1997: 70, on Jezreel and Megiddo); Zimhoni (1997: 38-39, on the pottery of Jezreel and Megiddo).2 Fi- nally on this point, it is true that Mazar, Zarzeki- Peleg, and Ben-Tor and Ben-Ami have disputed the Low Chronology, but Dever failed to mention that Finkelstein responded to each of their arguments in detail (e.g., Finkelstein 1998; 1999). Perhaps this is the place to turn to the foundations of Dever's view on the 10th century B.C.E. Accord- ing to his own acknowledgment (2001b: 131), it all comes from Gezer. One of the highlights of the Gezer excavations was the notion that red-slipped and burnished pottery can be used as a peg for dat- ing 10th-century strata (Holladay 1990). Dever has made this notion his bulwark against any attempt to challenge his (that is, Yadin's) paradigm on the ar- chaeology of the United Monarchy (e.g., Dever 1997: 237-39; 2001b: 132-33). However, this shows a fun- damental misunderstanding of a basic issue in ar- chaeological dating, namely, the difference between relative and absolute chronology. Needless to say, red-slipped and burnished pottery does not carry a date label and thus cannot provide us with an abso- lute chronological peg. On the contrary, this, as other types, can be given an absolute date only when the debate is settled. This fundamental error is best represented in Hol- laday's meticulous treatment of the red-slipped and burnished pottery (1990), which laid the foundation for Dever's articles. Holladay associated this type with the "Solomonic" stratum at Gezer: "The key stratum seems to be Gezer Field III Phase UG3A, which is both very short and historically exception- ally well positioned. It comes after the Solomonic building period, richly documented by biblical and historical data and secured by comparative regional archaeological and architectural criteria combined with comparative pottery criteria" (Holladay 1990: 62-63). In simpler words, the key stratum is dated by the pottery. The pottery is dated by its relation- ship to the six-chambered gate, which is, in turn, dated according to the biblical testimony to the days of Solomon. This is classical circular reasoning. Dever seems to be unaware of this logical fallacy. Describing his reconstruction of the archaeology of the United Monarchy, he says: "The careful reader will observe that in the case I have tried to make here for a 10th century 'Israelite state'. . .. I have made no reference to the biblical texts as evi- dence ... my evidence throughout has been archae- ological" (1997: 251). And in another place: "The pottery from this destruction layer included distinc- tive forms of red-slipped and slipped and hand bur- nished (polished) pottery, which have always been dated to the late 10th century.... Thus, on com- monly accepted ceramic grounds-not on naive acceptance of the Bible's stories ... -we dated the Gezer Field III city walls and gates to the mid-late 10th century" (2001b: 132). The "careful reader" that Dever refers to will certainly recognize that the opposite is true! Dever's entire reconstruction rests on the biblical testimony. How could he date the six- chambered gates to the days of Solomon if not for his adherence to 1 Kgs 9:15? How could he collect the evidence for his 10th-century strata if not for a specific type of pottery which he dated to that period because it was found in relation to the "Solomonic" gate at Gezer? A final note on reading and interpreting biblical material may be appropriate here. 1 Kgs 9:15-the cornerstone of Dever's view on the 10th century, reads: "And this is the account of the forced labor which King Solomon levied to build the house of the Lord and his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer." Dever has consistently misread this verse, with the misinterpretation seemingly growing with the passage of time. In his Gezer days, he incor- rectly translated the Hebrew lbnwt (= to build) as "to fortify" (Dever, Lance, and Wright 1970: 5; De- ver et al. 1971: 112)-a word that does not appear here (Ussishkin 1990: 76-77). Recently he went fur- ther, insisting that: "This text basically describes ... how Solomon subsequently 'built the wall' [De- ver's quotation marks] at Gezer, along with walls at Hazor, Megiddo, and Jerusalem" (2001b: 131). The use of quotation marks suggests to the reader that the biblical text is being quoted, while, in truth, De- ver is merely quoting himself about a nonexistent verse, one he himself invented. Needless to say, the 2Unpublished papers in support of the Low Chronology are T Ornan (on early Iron II art representation, delivered at the annual meeting of the Institute of Archaeology, Tell Aviv Uni- versity, 2001) and N. Franklin (on Samaria and Megiddo, deliv- ered at the Third International Congress of Archaeology in the Ancient Near East, Paris 2002).</page><page sequence="6">68 FINKELSTEIN AND SILBERMAN BASOR 327 only wall mentioned in the biblical text is that of Jerusalem. "... but again he [Finkelstein] contradicts him- self He admits that the biblical David and Solomon were historical figures, indeed kings; but according to him, they had no capital, indeed no kingdom, just a 'chiefdom' of a few villages in the Judaean hills, with a total population of no more than 5000" (2001a: 72). A quick look at the history of Palestine (or the Near East, for that matter) is enough to reveal simi- lar phenomena. Abdi-heba, the ruler of Jerusalem in the Amarna period, ruled over a vast area in the southern hill country from his highlands stronghold in Jerusalem. His territory embraced just a few vil- lages, far fewer than the number of villages in the 10th century, and an extremely limited sedentary population (Finkelstein 1996b: 234-35). Still, he was an influential figure in Canaan of that time, with his political maneuvers reaching Beth-shean in the north and the Shephelah in the west (for a comparison be- tween the situation in the Amarna period and the 10th century, see Na'aman 1996). Shechem's Labayu was not too different. Similar phenomena are known from other periods, early and late. Suffice it to men- tion the expansion of the kingdom of Amurru in the Amarna period (Singer 1991), the case of Fakhr ed- Din in the mountains of Lebanon in the 17th century (for the comparison, see Marfoe 1979), and the case of Dahir el-'Umar in the Galilee in the 18th century (for his career, see Cohen 1973: 7-19). "... what about the ninth to eighth century B.C. levels at Tell en-Nasbeh, Bethel, Gibeon, Beth- shemesh IIb, en-Gedi, Tell Beit Mirsim A2, Halif VIB, Beersheva IV-II, Arad XI-VIII, and, of course, Lachish IV? This is an impressive list of urban sites, some very well planned and defended.. ." (2001a: 72). A look at the fortifications at Tell en-Nasbeh (leaving the biblical associations aside) shows that they were constructed in the eighth century B.C.E. or a bit later (Katz 1998); we do not know of any ninth- century urban, well-planned, and defended centers at Bethel and Gibeon; sedentary activity at Ein Gedi began only in the seventh century B.C.E. (!); Arad was a fort, not an urban center; nobody knows the exact date of Tell Beit Mirsim A2, as detailed plates of pottery have never been published. The important sites for ninth-century Judah are indeed Lachish, Beer-sheba, and Beth-shemesh (discussed in detail in Finkelstein 2001, on the basis of a paper delivered at the 1999 SBL annual meeting). And why Dever brings Ramat Rahel to the debate (2001a: 72-73, n. 24) is not clear to us. Nobody contests monu- mental building activity in Judah in the eighth cen- tury B.C.E. "... to support their 'Aramaizing' of the north in the ninth century B.C., they claim that 'in almost every major Iron II site in the region, excavations yielded ostraca written in Aramaic'. . I do not know of any such Aramaic ostraca, nor did the authorities I consulted. Where is the evidence?" (2001a: 72-73, n. 24). Here is the citation from The Bible Unearthed: "And there is further reason to believe that the popu- lation in this part of the Israelite kingdom was at least partially, if not mostly, Aramaean. This is indi- cated by the fact that in almost every major Iron II [note we don't say ninth century!- I. E and N. A. S.] site in the region, excavations yielded ostraca writ- ten in Aramaic" (2001: 205). We are speaking about these ostraca as a tool in our attempt to decipher the demographic patterns in the north in the Iron II as a whole, not necessarily the ninth century! For the reader's convenience, we are citing the evidence from Finkelstein's Hazor article (1999): "Ninth-century Aramaic inscriptions were found at Dan and Ein Gev..." (Finkelstein 1999: 61, and references therein); this statement is followed by a note: "The Phoenician and Aramaic scripts appar- ently split only in the mid-eighth century (Naveh 1982: 78-81), hence the difficulty in classifying the Hazor VIII inscriptions. The identification of the Dan and Ein Gev inscriptions.., .as Aramaic is based on the language rather than the script" (Finkel- stein 1999: 67, n. 19). No less important: "The mixed nature of the population in the northeast in the Iron Age II is attested in the meagre, though varied, epigraphic material from the region. I refer to the Phoenician, Aramaic, and Hebrew inscriptions from Hazor, Dan, Bethsaida, Tel Hadar, and Ein Gev" (Finkelstein 1999: 67, n. 17, and references therein). "And in any case, their own figures prove them wrong. They state elsewhere (pp. 115, 145) that Judah in the eighth century B.c. had a population of at least 160,000" (2001a: 73). Here is the citation from page 115: "Finally-as a third major wave-the early Israelite settlement</page><page sequence="7">2002 THE BIBLE UNEARTHED: A REJOINDER 69 began around 1200 B.C.E. Like its predecessors, it commenced with mainly small, rural communities with an initial population of approximately 45,000 in 250 sites. It gradually developed into a mature system. ... By the highpoint of this settlement wave in the eighth century B.C.E., after the establishment of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel, it encompassed over five hundred sites, with a population of about 160,000." Needless to say, we are speaking here about the entire highlands, not Judah alone. Since there is nothing on page 145 about popula- tion, we gather that Dever refers to page 245. Here is the citation from this page, this time dealing with the population of the kingdom of Judah (includ- ing the Shephelah) in the late-Iron II: ". .. by the late eighth century there were about three hundred set- tlements of all sizes in Judah, from the metropolis of Jerusalem to small farmsteads, where once there were only a few villages and modest towns. The population, which had long hovered at a few tens of thousands, now grew to around 120,000" (2001: 245). "... on the matter of comparative demography, hardly a science.. ." (2001a: 73). Interestingly, in his recent book, published at the same time as his review article of The Bible Un- earthed, Dever does not think that palaeodemo- graphy is "hardly a science." There, he asserts: "Population estimates, based on well-developed ethnographic parallels and site size, indicate..." (2001b: 110). "Regarding literacy, Finkelstein and Silberman themselves discuss some of the abundant evidence for literacy, such as seals, inscribed weights, os- traca, and even a few probable royal inscriptions" (2001a: 73). Dever brings up this point in order to prove his view that Judah was an important state already in the tenth-ninth centuries B.C.E. But all seals, weights, and ostraca (except, possibly, for a single ostracon from Arad-Renz 1995: 44-45) uncovered in Judah do not date prior to the eighth century; in fact, their majority date to the seventh century B.C.E. We all agree that by that time Judah has developed into a real, full-blown state. "Nowhere, for instance, do they deal with the Hebrew prophets, whom the revisionists dismiss as late literary inventions, but whom most would re- gard as actual historical figures of the crisis years in the eighth through sixth centuries B.C." (2001a: 73). Dever should look at the following pages in The Bible Unearthed: 212-14 (Amos and Hosea, regard- ing social injustice in the Northern Kingdom), 253, 263, 290, 297, 298, and 306. Prophetic works are mentioned for both the eighth and seventh-sixth centuries B.C.E., although with due caution (many biblical scholars would see later redactions in most prophetic works; see recent summary in R6mer and de Pury 2000: 75-82). CATEGORY #2: PERSONAL CHARACTERIZATIONS, SCHOLARSHIP, AND IDEOLOGICAL ASSUMPTIONS Dever concluded his review of our book with a series of serious ad hominem statements. We feel that his allegations should not remain unanswered. "Nor will they necessarily see through the au- thors' ideological agenda. The latter is what is really 'unearthed' here" (2001a: 69); "this work reads more like an ideological manifesto" (2001a: 69). Dever here brands as "an ideological manifesto" a work that simply contains ideas he does not agree with. Needless to say, every book with a definite point of view or a coherent hypothesis-including Dever's-can be labeled by its detractors as an "ideological manifesto." "Finkelstein represents the newly fashionable 'post-Zionist' historiographical school in Israel" (2001a: 69). Living in Israel and being interested in the de- bates over the recent history of his country, Fin- kelstein does not know what exactly is the "post- Zionist historiographical school." We suppose that in the main, Dever refers to anything that contests standard interpretations of Israel's modem history. Except for dropping the term, he does not offer sub- stantive references to the serious issues at stake in the debate in Israel. "Silberman is obviously not a practicing aca- demic archaeologist" (2001a: 68). What is Dever's definition of "a practicing aca- demic archaeologist" and how is it relevant to the evaluation of a book? Silberman's contribution to</page><page sequence="8">70 FINKELSTEIN AND SILBERMAN BASOR 327 this book-and his earlier books and articles-must be judged for themselves, not rated by a vaguely defined occupational category. "Finkelstein's work reflects his lack of formal training in biblical studies" (2001a: 68). Finkelstein's knowledge of biblical studies must be judged not solely on the basis of formal training, but also on the basis of his familiarity with the lit- erature and ongoing discussions in this discipline. His own formal training notwithstanding, Dever still reads the biblical description of the history of Israel as a straightforward, real-time historical testimony. In the case of the United Monarchy of the days of Solomon, he chooses to overlook six decades of re- search on the complex nature of the Deuteronomistic History, especially regarding the days of Solomon (e.g., Van Seters 1983: 307-12; Knauf 1991; Auld 1996; Miller 1997; Niemann 1997). In another case Dever expresses the opinion that the book of Judges represents a genuine portrait of life in the Iron I. Describing the Iron I highlands villages he says: "Politically, there appears to be no central authority, although the inhabitants do seem to be in the process of defining themselves as an ethnic group. Needless to say, this accords well with the statement in Judges: 'In those days there was no king in Israel, and every man did what was right in his own eyes'..." (2001b: 113). Dever disregards the late date and strong theological intent of the book of Judges (see summaries with bibliography in O'Brien 1994; Romer and de Pury 2000: 116-23). "As for Silberman, his published works have con- sistently been marked by the typical postmodernist notion that all claims to knowledge are simply 'so- cial constructs'; that every reading of the traditional 'meta-narrative' ... is all about politics (2001a: 69). Silberman has never stated or implied that all claims to knowledge are simply social constructs or that every historical text is about politics; only that some clearly are-and they deserve to be fully analyzed. "But everything is not 'ideology.' As the British social philosopher Eric Hobsbawn has insisted, there are facts; facts matter; and some facts matter a great deal" (2001a: 69). Hobsbawm is a historian, not a social philoso- pher. He is well known, among his other achieve- ments, for editing and contributing to the now-classic book The Invention of Tradition (Hobsbawm and Ranger 1983), which masterfully shows with facts and footnotes how some cherished texts, rituals, and beliefs are indeed "ideology." It is the task, even the obligation, of the historian and archaeologist to find out which they are. "Finally, many of the shortcomings noted above stem from the book's principal fault: there is little or no documentation for any of the authors' sweeping claims. There are a few explanatory notes at the bottom of some pages; but there is not a single foot- note, nor is there any citation of published data" (2001a: 70). The Bible Unearthed is a book for the public. Nevertheless, it has 17 pages of bibliography at the end, with 260 bibliographic entries (80, by the way, refer to biblical research), set according to chapters and topics. In contrast, Dever's new book (2001b) presents a four-page bibliography with 62 references (only five of which refer to biblical studies) and minimalist footnotes, very many of which refer to his own works. A FINAL WORD We do not want to end this response with a minor quibble about footnotes, for we believe that there is a much more important point to be made. In our opinion, Dever's "review article" was neither dis- passionate nor fair. One would assume that such a review article on the recent debates about the reli- ability of the historical narratives of the Bible would have to include a serious assessment of all sides and issues involved in the discussion. Instead, the piece makes Dever's conservative po- lemics-and indeed the positions he espouses in his recent book (Dever 2001b)-appear to be the "nor- mative" voice of the field. This is not the case, in either archaeology or biblical studies, where a wide range of positions that challenge older, unnuanced readings of biblical history are now regularly pre- sented, discussed, and widely accepted. The question of who is unearthing the Bible and who is burying it again-and whose ideas are main- stream and whose are not-will be determined in due time not by the polemics of any individual, but by continued research, additional discoveries in the field, and the reasoned, collective judgment of our discipline.</page><page sequence="9">2002 THE BIBLE UNEARTHED: A REJOINDER 71 REFERENCES Albright, W.
