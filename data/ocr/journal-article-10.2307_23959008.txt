<plain_text><page sequence="1">626 REVIEWS Faith Faith and Reason. By Richard Swinburne. Pp. 206. Oxford: The Clarendon Press, 1981. £16·οο. With this volume, which is somewhat shorter than its predecessors, Richard Swinburne, who is Professor of Philosophy at the Univer sity of Keele, completes the trilogy on philosophical theology that he began with The Coherence of Theism (1977) and The Existence of of God (1979). The whole work is comparable in size with Tennant's Philosophical Theology and represents a considerable achievement. Everyone interested in the philosophy of religion is already studying these volumes and deciding that he either loves them, or loves to hate them. Many philosophers admire their professionalism, but theologians marvel that at this time of day so intelligent a writer should disdain the whole development of modern theology and religious studies, adopt a resolutely pre critical outlook, and set out to defend an eighteenth-century theology in the manner of William Paley. Swinburne is both an extreme theological realist and a liberal. In the first volume he was already setting out to show that faith is propositional, that the propositions of faith are empirical hypotheses, and that so far as possible the terms used in the propositions of faith should be understood in their standard mundane senses. One ought to be as anthropomorphic as possible because anthropomorphism is, for Swinburne, 'clarity'. In the end he was obliged to conclude that some of the terms used in describing God have to be understood in analogically extended senses. The vagueness thus introduced means that a positive proof of the coherence of theism cannot be had. But at least, he argued, theism is not demonstrably incoherent. In the second volume he argued that it is more probable than not that there is such a God as he had earlier defined. In his third volume he seeks to show that we have a duty to pursue religious investigations, and to adopt and to act upon those religious beliefs which seem to be more probably true than any of the alternatives to them that are to be found among the heresies and among other religions. But Swin burne is not a dogmatist and requires only a 'weak belief' in a creed; i.e. the belief that its items are severally more probable than their alternatives, and that some one creed taken as a whole is a more probably adequate guide to the highly desirable goals of the religious life than any alternative creed. Thus Swinburne's religion is a matter of the probable truth of literal theism, considered as an empirical hypothesis: that is what</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 62ל I meant by calling his theology eighteenth-century, and suggesting that it belongs in the tradition that runs from Boyle and Locke through Butler to Paley. He is aware of an alternative tradition stemming from Luther and Kierkegaard, but he thinks it 'almost unbelievably unclear', and cannot find a satisfactory modern statement of it. There seems to be an element of bias here, for I at least find the philosophical theologies of Kierkegaard, Bultmann, and D. Z. Phillips to be both clear and more religiously adequate; but Swinburne's personal commitment to thoroughgoing realism is so strong that he is simply not willing to take them seriously. Phillips's Concept of Prayer, for example, is said not really to describe prayer at all, but merely an activity 'which has some outward similarity to prayer'. Like many present-day philosophers, Swinburne cannot see why it is that in the post-Kantian period the claims of theological realism and religious seriousness have increasingly come into conflict with each other. That is the point of the frequent polemics against 'objectifying theology'. There are one or two oddities in Faith and Reason. One is the absence of any detailed justification for the ideas about life after death which play so large a part in the argument. Another is that the probability calculus which was so carefully worked out in The Existence Existence of God here seems rather slack. One suspects that if it were worked out in more detail Swinburne's position would dissolve away. For with respect to any item of theological belief, the variety of views that deserve attention across the religions, among theo logians within each religion, and among philosophers as to the logical status of any such doctrine, is vast. If we are going to be realists, then any one such view, if it is to deserve to be acted upon, needs to have more than a slightly higher probability than each one of the dozens (or hundreds) of alternatives, considered severally. For it might have such a slightly higher probability, and yet in itself still have only an extremely low probability. Swinburne tries to stop the slide to agnosticism by saying that creeds tend to be coherent wholes and only a limited number of them deserve to be taken seriously, but some may think that the whole discussion only shows that Kierkegaard was right about the unsatisfactoriness of 'the probable' as a basis for faith. Nevertheless, whether you like or heartily dislike what Swin burne has done, you cannot fail to be impressed and stimulated by it. Don Cupitt Don Cupitt</page></plain_text>
