<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art as Symbolic Form: Cassirer on the Educational Value of Art THORA ILIN BAYER Introduction Among the papers that Ernst Cassirer left at his death in 1945 is a fully writ- ten out lecture labeled "Seminar of Education, March 10th, 1943," which also bears the title "The Educational Value of Art." It may have been pre- pared for a session of Cassirer's seminar at Yale for that spring on Aesthet- ics: Symbolic Forms, the second half of a yearlong course.1 The text begins with discussion of the Platonic quarrel with the poets and moves through views of various thinkers, especially Croce and Collingwood. Cassirer had planned to have a volume on art included in The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, in addition to those on Language, Mythical Thought, and The Phenomenology of Knowledge.2 In these three volumes he often mentions the triad of language, myth, and art, but he says little of art as such. In May 1942 in a letter to Paul Schilpp, the American philosopher and editor of the volume of critical essays on Cassirer's work in the Library of Living Philosophers series, Cassirer wrote that he had intended to produce a volume on art but the disfavor (Ungunst) of the times caused him to put it off again and again.3 The principal sources of Cassirer's aesthetics are his chapter on art in An Essay on Man4 and two lectures on the educational val- ue of art called "Language and Art I &amp; II,'"5 which parallel his earlier small study, Language and Myth.6 Cassirer's conception of art as a symbolic form is derived from his conception of human culture as a systematic structure of symbolic forms that has as its main components myth and religion, lan- guage, art, history, and science (the chapter titles of the second part of An Essay on Man). In addition to these forms of culture there is a "metaphys- ics of symbolic forms," the subject of a fourth volume of The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms, left in manuscript at his death.7 Thora Ilin Bayer is Associate Professor and Chair of the Department of Philosophy and is RosaMary Professor of Liberal Arts at Xavier University of Louisiana, New Orleans.

My aim in pursuing these questions is not to argue for the correctness of Cassirer's views but to at- tempt to establish what his views in fact are. Little has been written directly on Cassirer's conception of art relative to the frequency with which his name is mentioned in general discussions of aesthetics.8 Cassirer's conception of education is a nearly unexamined subject.9 The Platonic Quarrel: Mimesis Cassirer says: "Of all the problems that we have to study in a philosophy of education, the problem of the educational value of art is one of the most difficult ones."10 He claims that this problem goes back to the beginning of philosophy itself and that at present we are still very far from a generally accepted solution. Plato's famous quarrel with the poets in the tenth book of the Republic is important not simply for an understanding of ancient aesthetics but also for philosophy's conception of itself. The basic tenets of this quarrel are well known. I wish to review them here toward the goal of suggesting an original view of it that is derivable from Cassirer's approach. The issue is whether poetry or philosophy is the means to truth. The works of Homer had scriptural status for the Greeks and were thought to contain all that was necessary for civil wisdom. Poiein is to make and compose poetry. The ancient poet is a maker of truth claims through language. The quarrel rests on the fact that the philosopher is also a maker of truth claims formulated in words. Is the relatively new figure in Plato's time of the philosophos, the friend or lover of wisdom, a new kind of poet, or is the philosopher a bringer of a new type of knowledge, different in kind from that of poetry? Plato's problem is to make clear the difference between Homer and Socrates. In the Sophist (265b) the productive arts (poetikai technai) are divided into divine and human craftsmanship; there is also another kind of productiv- ity that is shared by god and human beings. This type does not produce originals but rather copies (eikones). This type depends on mimesis, which governs the art of the poet, painter, sculptor, and actor. The craftsman (de- miourgos), if divine, produces the original. In the Republic (596b) the god produces the eidos of the bed. The carpenter produces the physical, sensible object of the bed but it is only an eikon in relation to the eidos of the bed. Yet this physical bed is the original for the painter whose product imitates it. The problem concerns whether the activity of the carpenter or the artist has as its product an entity that is ontologically inferior to its model (para- deigma). Thus, through the principle of mimesis, Plato distinguishes between a true reality and a mimetic reality. The knowledge of images, eikasia, is the</page><page sequence="3">Art as Symbolic Form 53 lowest segment on Plato's Divided Line. True knowledge (episteme) will be of originals only. Opinion (doxa) will be of the imitative being of sensible particulars. But that of art, of techne poietike mimetike, will be of shadows of the sensible second-order "originals." The ontological and epistemological distinction between eide and eikones is the basis of Plato's claim to replace the poets as the traditional teachers of wisdom with the philosophers. Plato objects to the fine arts and their practitioners on two grounds: they are untrue and they are dangerous as a guide to human conduct. Phronesis, or practical wisdom upon which proper human conduct is founded and through which civil wisdom is attained, requires virtue. A virtuous act is something made in a sense analogous to the way in which a sensible object is mimetic of an eidos. The virtuous act must have a consistency with its model. It cannot imitate both a virtue and its opposite vice. The poets are governed by imagination that is rooted in sensation (aisthesis). They trust in their senses and are unable to discern the hidden logos in things. Thus, they have no principle of noesis, no noetic grasp of the nature of things. The poets will imitate equally acts of virtue and vice; they portray both good and evil without hesitation. The poets cannot sup- ply through their productions a standard of conduct because they have no access to the eide. Achilles is the very image of courage, but we cannot also allow him to say as Homer does that he would rather be a serf to a lesser man alive on earth than be the king over the dead in Hades (Rep. 386c; Ody. XI, 489-91).11 How can we learn courage from such conflicting claims? Plato says: "But as long as poetry is not able to make its apology, when we listen to it, we will chant this argument we are making to ourselves as a counter charm, taking care against falling back into this love, which is childish and belongs to the many" (Rep. 608a). Poetry can make no apology (defense) for itself for it lacks the elenchus. Philosophy is the counter charm to poetry's inborn charm to which we are always prone to return, as we are to that which we originally loved as the medium of our childhood imagination. The poets ask no questions. Poetry cannot produce the elenchus in which the meaning of a virtue can be sought. The poet can produce an image of simply anything, which is the inherent power of the imagination. But po- etry has within it no method for the judging of images. Any sensible object can be formed as an image in an indefinite number of ways, all of which are equally valid as images of it. The poet, dominated by the power of the image, has no way to know what he or she does not know. The poet has no sense of ignorance, which only the device of the question and answer of the elenchus can command and produce in its participants. At the most basic level the poet or the rhapsode, the teller or the reteller of the myth, is governed completely by the single trope of metaphor. The trope of irony is closed to the myth. Irony is the trope typical of philosophy because it not</page><page sequence="4">54 Bayer only carries the meaning of one thing into another as does the metaphor, it critically juxtaposes one kind of meaning (the literal) against another that is expressed only by implication. To grasp an irony is to realize that it intends a meaning beyond what is said. An irony acts against literal-mindedness. But the myth means exactly what is said in that it is mimetic. The mythic is not and cannot as such be philosophic. If the above is the standard view of the ancient quarrel, what further is implicit in Cassirer's approach? Cassirer, with Hegel, the great philosopher of opposites, knows that the strongest and most antagonistic oppositions depend upon the fact that such oppositions share an unstated common fac- tor. The common factor in the ancient quarrel is that both poetry and phi- losophy are mimetic. Philosophy requires mimesis just as much as poetry does, but it requires it in a different way. Poetry's mimesis is of what is seen by the bodily eye--the object that can be sensed. Philosophy's mimesis is of what is seen only by the mind's eye--the form (eidos) that can be noetically grasped and upon which the reality of the sensible object depends. When philosophically employed the mind imitates the forms in its thoughts and in the way it employs language to express them. The poet and the philosopher are both imitators. Poetic wisdom can be so easily mistaken for philosophic wisdom because the image gives symbolic form to the sensible object, and the sensible object is thus taken up into the mind. Yet the sensible object is not fully taken up into the mind because what accounts for its own ultimate reality is not explicitly present in the image. The ultimate reality of the ob- ject, for Plato, requires the power of noetic vision to imitate in thought and language the thing as it truly is. Had Plato himself made the mimetic sense of philosophy more explicit, the necessity of preserving the validity of both sides of the quarrel might have been realized at the beginning of Western philosophy. It would have been apparent that philosophical thought requires the image as the initial means of access to the noetic, and that in the production of philosophy this dialectic of image and idea must constantly be renewed. The key to philo- sophical education would then have been seen to be aesthetic experience that passes beyond itself and confronts itself in the metaphysical experience of the form. This dialectical sense of mimesis is not what emerged from the quarrel, however, and the agenda of Western philosophy was set in terms of the need for poetry to defend itself from philosophy and philosophy to sep- arate itself ever further from the poetic. Cassirer asks: "Have these blames, cast on the educational value of art, ever been refuted? In the whole history of aesthetics we find the continuous echo of Plato's accusations. It became one of the most important tasks of every theory of art to refute or at least to enfeeble the Platonic arguments."12 Cassirer sees the attempt to meet Plato's accusations against art as be- ginning immediately with Aristotle. Here he also suggests an original</page><page sequence="5">Art as Symbolic Form 55 approach. He interprets Aristotle's doctrine of catharsis as intended to show that art does not simply stir the emotions but is a way to calm and manage them. As Aristotle says in Politics, when heard by persons in ecstasy sacred songs have the effect of calming these persons "as though they had gone through a medical cure and a catharsis" (1342a). In Greek ethics, this state of calmness is designated by the term euthymia, which refers to an inner harmony of the soul, an ultimate form of compromise. Aristotle accepts the view that art depends on mimesis, even using it in the Poetics as a definition of man: "Imitation is natural to man from childhood, one of his advantages over the lower animals being this, that he is the most imitative creature in the world, and learns first by imitation" (1448b6-9). Cassirer regards Aristotle's doctrine of catharsis as neither primarily a moral nor a psychological ap- proach to art. He regards it as an understanding of how art is active and not passive on its audience. It is a doctrine of how the emotions are vitalized by the artwork. This vitalization depends upon the way aesthetic form can affect the emotions. Thus, Aristotle does not reduce art to the emotions. His concern is how aesthetic form as distinct from the emotions can causally affect them. Modem Aesthetics: Liricitii Cassirer says: "The history of aesthetics seems constantly to oscillate between two opposite poles--between an intellectual and an emotional approach to art. The former prevails in all the classical and neo-classical theories of art; the second seems now accepted by most of our modern theories."13 The classical and neo-classical conceptions of art as mimetic begin to break down at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The French critic Charles Batteux, in Les beaux arts reduits ai un mme principe (1747), defends the theory of imitation in general but questions whether lyrical poetry is truly imita- tion and asks whether it is not more correctly enthusiasm. Cassirer finds the decisive turning point on this issue in Rousseau's treatise on education, his Nouvelle Hdloi'se. In Rousseau's view the mimetic principle of art represent- ing the world must give way to art as the manifestation of our deepest pas- sions. In Rousseau's view the real meaning of art can only be found through this approach, and the prototype of this emotional sense of art can be found in lyrical art. The central representative of lyricism (liricith) as the basis of art in mod- ern philosophy is Benedetto Croce's Aesthetic as Science of Expression and General Linguistic. Cassirer also regards R. G. Collingwood's Principles of Art as holding the same essential position as Croce's grounding of art in the phenomenon of lyrical expression.14 Cassirer is often associated with Croce and Collingwood in his general idealistic approach to history and culture, but concerning aesthetics Cassirer is strongly critical of their position.15</page><page sequence="6">56 Bayer Cassirer finds Croce's theory correct in that it rejects both the imitative and the hedonistic theories of art. But in equating art with expression Croce is unable to differentiate between the mere fact of expression and the mode of expression. Cassirer claims not all acts of expression are works of art. Anyone can express feelings in passionate ways, but such expressions are not properly works of art. Art involves not only the expression of emotion; it also involves a constructive process in which the emotions involved are finely formed. Cassirer's criticism of Croce presupposes the theory of expression that Cassirer develops in the third volume of The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms. Cassirer presents a complete phenomenology of knowledge (Erkenntnis) that originates in the "expressive function" (Ausdrucksfunktion) of consciousness. At the level of the phenomenon of expression the perceptual immediacy of the world is captured by the power of the image. Cassirer says: "For what 'is' in the object in its expressive character is not taken up and destroyed in the image; on the contrary, it is set in high relief and intensified. The image frees this expressive reality from all merely accidental determinations and concentrates it in a single focus."16 The symbolic form that corresponds to the expressive function is myth: "the mythical world of forms shows us a way to the understanding of the phenomena of pure expression."17 Expres- sion does not represent a world of objects; it presents the contents of the world in a flow of images. Consciousness has no distance from this immediacy of images; its reality is the same as its images. When the image begins to separate into itself and its object, the world of the thing and the thing-symbolized arise in consciousness. This separation brings about the representational function of consciousness (Darstellungs- funktion). The symbolic form that corresponds to this function is language. Language for Cassirer refers to a form of consciousness that orders the world in terms of thing-attribute, subject-object, and symbol-symbolized. It is representational and referential thinking. Language produces what we ordinarily regard as our common sense world, which is embodied in the principles of Aristotelian class logic and descriptive-discursive forms of thought instead of imagistic renderings of experience.18 By equating aes- thetic with general linguistics, as the title of his work announces, Croce can- not adequately distinguish between myth, language, and art. They all are expressive as opposed to purely cognitive or theoretical thought. Cassirer's phenomenology of theoretical thought involves his third function of con- sciousness, that of signification (reine Bedeutungsfunktion). Theoretical or scientific knowledge is built up through systems of symbols. Such purely scientific consciousness goes beyond the representational function of the words of language that refer to things. The key to purely theoretical thought is the idea of mathematical formulae and the power of formal thinking to develop levels of symbolic order.</page><page sequence="7">Art as Symbolic Form 57 The concept of the object at the level of the significative function of con- sciousness is that of o(x) in which x stands for any series of variables and 0 stands for the principle by which the x-series is ordered or generated. The bond between these two levels of symbols is inseparable because each has no meaning in itself. Only when both function together is there a meaning- ful thought pattern. The order here is not simply linear because the o ele- ment can stand to another level of symbolism as a part of its (x), and in like manner the original (x) can function as a o or principle of order in a sub- series.19 This conception of the significative or scientific symbol is crucial for Cassirer's conception of art as a symbolic form. Art arises in consciousness only when consciousness has freed itself from the empirical sense of the world that Cassirer identifies with language. The art object is not the thing and its attributes of language the representational function of consciousness that language requires. The artist creates the art object by moving away from the purely empirical object. The artist can use language to create literature, but in so doing the referential and representa- tional power of language is transformed such that linguistic symbolism can produce a "fiction." In like manner the subject-object relationship is altered such that in the art object the artist produces subjectivity as a kind of ob- jectivity. What is symbolized in art is generated from the process of sym- bolization itself in a sense analogous to the o(x) bond of purely theoretical thinking. The Place of Art and Myth in Culture Through his phenomenology of the three functions of consciousness, Cassir- er can distinguish myth from art-two forms that are often conflated in aes- thetic theory. The mythical imagination remains at the level of immediacy. Myth regards all of its images as categorical truths. All primal myths pres- ent themselves as true and complete stories about the nature of the world, gods, and man. By contrast, the aesthetic imagination regards its images as "hypothetical" rather than "categorical" truths. A mythical account of hu- man nature is a complete account of man as such. A novel, poem, drama, sculpture, or painting of a human subject offers us an aspect of the human condition, a version of it that has been freely constructed. As Cassirer puts it in Language and Myth, "The [artistic] spirit lives in the word of language and in the mythic image without falling under the control of either. What po- etry expresses is neither the mythic word-picture of gods and daemons, nor the logical truth of abstract determinations and relations."20 Art is a form of deliberate self-knowledge: "This liberation is achieved not because the mind throws aside the sensuous forms of word and image, but in that it uses them both as organs of its own, and thereby recognizes them for what they really are: forms of its own self-revelation."21 Art cannot occur until</page><page sequence="8">58 Bayer consciousness reaches the level of science, the level at which consciousness can deliberately construct its object (aesthetical or theoretical). Art is a counterpart of science as a symbolic form to the extent that both art and science consciously presuppose the power to make a version of the world in symbols. Art is the realization of the subjective. Science is the re- alization of the objective. Science in principle eliminates all subjectivity in its constructions. Unlike art, science's constructions must fit what is in the world. Cassirer says that one of the principal aims of scientific thought is the elimination of all personal and anthropomorphic elements in its theories. He says: "In the words of Bacon, science strives to conceive the world 'ex analogia universi,' not 'ex analogia hominis."'22 Cassirer differentiates science, morality, and art in terms of how each produces a different form of order. He says: "Science gives us order in thoughts; morality gives us order in ac- tions; art gives us order in the apprehension of visible, tangible, and audible appearances."23 Both science and art, in Cassirer's view, are forms of hu- man knowledge: "art may be described as knowledge, but art is knowledge of a peculiar and specific kind."24 Scientific truth consists in the explanation and theoretical description of things. Art consists in the intensification and sympathetic grasp of things. Cassirer insists that as a symbolic form art has its own inner form that dif- ferentiates it from the other forms in the spectrum of cultural activity. There is no one form of cultural activity that gives us access to what the object is in itself. No one form of our experience is more "symbolic" than another. All forms of human experience occur through the medium of the symbol, whether those symbols are mythic images, words of natural language, or numbers and signs of mathematical and scientific theories. Cassirer defines man as animal symbolicum.25 He offers a thought-experiment to show how any act of perception is inherently a symbolic act. This experiment illus- trates how each perception of the object involves "symbolic pregnance" (symbolische Priignanz), that any perceived object is at once something phys- ical and something mental (geistig). A written word is at once a physical configuration of marks on a surface and a meaning; a spoken word is both a breath of air and a meaning. Cassirer asks the reader to consider a graph- like line drawing (Linienzug). We can apprehend it in terms of its sensible attributes--the tension in its shape, its motion, etc. We can then withdraw from the immediacy of these properties and regard it as a mathematical ob- ject, having geometric proportions and relations. We may then grasp it as a mythical-magical sign and from this pass to seeing it as an aesthetic orna- ment, regarding it in terms of the beauty of its visual qualities.26 The object, what it is physically, is one pole of its being, which is joined with another pole; this other pole is the way the fact of its existence is formed by the mind in the symbolic act. These formations that are rooted in perception are writ large in the basic forms of human cultural activity. Art is one of these among many.</page><page sequence="9">Art as Symbolic Form 59 Educational Ideals If art may be understood as a symbolic form having a place in Cassirer's general philosophy of culture, what is the educational value of art? If, as Cassirer claims, all aesthetic theories are responses to this Platonic question, what is the Cassirerian answer? In Cassirer's philosophy of human culture there is a philosophy of human education that remains implicit, but Cassirer never makes it truly explicit. At the end of his lecture on "The Educational Value of Art," he declares that art is "an essential and indispensable element in the system of liberal education." He says: "Art is a way to freedom, the process of the liberation of the human mind which is the real and ultimate aim of all education; it has to fulfill a task of its own, a task that cannot be replaced by any other function."27 At the end of An Essay on Man he says, "Human culture taken as a whole may be described as the process of man's progressive self-liberation."28 Implicit in Cassirer's conception of art as symbolic form in human culture are four principal claims that can function as ideals for a conception of human education in regard to art: 1. Art is an act of human freedom. 2. Art is separate from morality. 3. Art is a counterpart to science. 4. Art is myth remembered. I wish to emphasize that these are ideals, and as ideals they are guides to understanding and action. The principles necessary to their realization are not given in Cassirer's account. Their power lies in the fact that before any value can be consciously realized, it must be idealized. The ideal provides direction, and therein is its virtue. In regard to the first claim, Cassirer, like Hegel, understands human freedom as self-determination. Freedom is not freedom from certain restric- tions or limitations. Freedom is the power to set conditions, to act on one's own terms in relation to what is possible. The artwork is something made. It is the product of what Cassirer, in the fourth volume of The Philosophy of Symbolic Forms: The Metaphysics of Symbolic Forms, calls the "basis phenom- enon" of "the work," or das Werk. Werk as opposed to Arbeit or ordinary labor entails the production of an object. The aim of this production is self- knowledge. The human self is shaped through its ability to make its world. Cassirer says: "Know your work and know 'yourself' in your work; know what you do, so you can do what you know. Give shape to what you do ... a work in which you recognize yourself as the sole creator and actor."29 The artwork in its making and in its remaking by those who would comprehend it is an embodiment of the fundamental human phenomenon of Werk. In regard to the second claim, Cassirer denies that art has a purpose out- side itself. Its purpose is not morality, nor is art inherently corruptive of</page><page sequence="10">60 Bayer moral sensibility. Art is a way of forming the emotions and of awakening feeling within the limits of its type of formation. Art orders our perceptions. Morality orders our actions, as mentioned above. This sense of art as sym- bolic form is different than the claim of "art for art's sake," a view Cassirer does not accept. Art for Cassirer is rooted in common experience. It does not require special sensibilities such that art is seen as an experience open only to artists and connoisseurs. Art is expression, but it is not simply ex- pression. It is expression formed as a knowledge of the world as sensed. Morality begins from a sense of the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, just and unjust and forms an understanding of human action in terms of these. Art can pose moral problems, but it does so not because of its self-identity as art but because the aesthetic and the moral both exist within culture. The moral and the aesthetic stand to each other in the same way as Cassirer says all the symbolic forms stand to each other within cul- ture as opposites and at the same time as compliments or, as he puts it, as "harmony in contrariety."30 In regard to the third claim, Cassirer holds that art arises within hu- man culture in a dialectical relation to science. He says, "In art we do not conceptualize the world, we perceptualize it."31 Theoretical thought directs the mind toward concepts; art directs the mind toward perceptions. Art stands to science as subject to object. The practice of science teaches us to approach the world by attempting to eliminate the subjective. In this way science achieves a type of universality independent of the personality of its practitioners and of the particular culture in which scientific truths are achieved. We can speak of Chinese art, Indian art, Eskimo art, European art, etc., but we cannot do the same with science. Scientific truth does not in principle vary from culture to culture. This invariance and objectivity is the ideal of scientific inquiry. Art is the objectification of the subjective of the artist's consciousness and the consciousness of a particular culture. The self encounters its inner life in all of its manifold forms. Without art and the particularity of aesthetic form, the self would lose itself in the being of the world. Art and science are necessary counterparts in the life of the self. To ignore the education of the self in its powers to feel and be perceptive is as dangerous to the full life of the self as it is to ignore the importance of its powers to theorize and conceptualize the world scientifically. In regard to the fourth claim, Cassirer makes a fundamental distinction between art and myth. Myth is tied to the immediacy of the object. In mythic consciousness the world and the word are held on the same level of actual- ity. At the level of the myth and the mythic ritual the dancer wearing the mask of the god does not represent the god whose being is elsewhere--the dancer literally is the god. The dancer's being and the god's are immediate- ly one. As consciousness gains distance from the world it gains in the power of self-determination. Distance from the object allows for the freedom of the</page><page sequence="11">Art as Symbolic Form 61 self to develop its purely subjective powers. This sense of subjectivity is the basis of the artist's ability to give form deliberately to feeling and emotion, not simply to respond to expression but actively to shape it. But with the emergence of the aesthetic stance comes also a loss--the loss of the power of the origin. Art is always consciously or unconsciously an attempt at recov- ery of what is immediately present in the myth. The original truths of the myth are the meanings that art is always renewing in novel ways. Art is our most direct access to them. Once the immediacy of mythic expression is left behind it can only be partially recovered, and without art we would forget it. In what sense can Cassirer claim to have offered an answer to the ancient Platonic quarrel with the poets and artists? Cassirer's reconception of the philosophical problem of form, from the Platonic one of the forms (eide) as transcendent of the sensible to the Kantian one of form as transcendental based on the symbolic pregnance of the sensible, allows Cassirer to claim that philosophers should go to school with the poets. The quarrel of Platonic idealism with the poets is a quarrel with mythical thought. Once myth is seen as a thought-form of the original, the primordial form of the symbolic act, it becomes the starting point for all acts of consciousness and thought and it is the indispensable starting point. Transcendental idealism can ac- knowledge as many forms of knowledge as there are symbolic forms. Each has its own reality that is in dialectical relationship with the others. From the perspective of his philosophy of symbolic forms, Cassirer has projected in modern terms the possibility of a positive connection between philoso- phy and poetry, which was originally precluded in the agenda of Western philosophy, as described at the end of the section on the ancient quarrel above. Cassirer accepts both the mimetic and the emotional conceptions of art in a modified form. He accepts the mimetic view that art is a form of knowl- edge, but modifies this knowledge claim in terms of his conception of the symbol. Art is knowledge not simply in regard to the fact that the symbol can capture what is apprehended by the senses but because the symbol has the power of the imagination to modify the object into new and novel senses of itself. Art is not reducible to emotion. Art is the active formation of emotion. The work of art shapes the world in terms of emotion and orders the object in a new way. We see the object as if for the first time, and in this way a kind of knowledge is achieved. Cassirer accepts the truth that is in both the mimetic and emotional views of art, and through the principles of his philosophy of culture he produces the idea of art as symbolic form. Conclusion Cassirer's aesthetic analysis understands art as the result of three different kinds of imagination: "the power of invention, the power of personification,</page><page sequence="12">62 Bayer and the power to produce pure sensuous forms."32 The artist invents an object. The artist does not simply imitate what is found in nature. The art object is the product of the artist's subjectivity, the artist's persona. In this sense it is a personification. What the artist produces is not something ir- rational or unnatural; it is something distinctively human, an act of self- knowledge. The artist produces pure sensuous forms. The artist uses the distinctive power of the imagination to bring before consciousness an object that is sensuous. The art object, although not a direct product of the senses, appears to consciousness as if it were such. The form of the art object is or- ganic. It is a whole, the elements of which are not truly separable from their function in the whole. The organic nature of the art object is responsible for its vitality. It is as if it were alive. It has a living quality. Its living quality comes not just from the organic nature of its form but from the fact that the art object forms and projects human emotions. The art object is perceived, felt, and thought. Not only the artist requires the three powers of the imagination; the audi- ence or recipient of the art object also requires them to grasp fully what the artist has produced. The recipient must participate in the artistic invention and personification and finally grasp the form. The form of the art object is what makes it a subjective universal. The form makes it more than a unique particular; its form is responsible for its universal meaning. But the form is not separable from its particular sensuous and emotional content. The form allows the artist to make and its recipient to experience a unique object that is the art object. The great artist is a master of this sense of form. This unique sense of form is what imbeds the work of the great artist in consciousness such that after Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe, Italian, English, and Ger- man are not the same as they were before them, and after Michelangelo and Palladio our vision and sense of space is changed. The educational role of art rests on its power to cause the imagination to invent, personify, and form experience in this way. Art is a process in which the self confronts the inner world of subjectivity and forms it as an object accessible in the distinctively human world of culture. Cassirer's approach suggests that a philosophy of art cannot be self-grounded but that any philosophical comprehension of art, any aesthetic theory, ultimately requires grounding in a full philosophy of human culture.

Of the work that has been done on Cassirer's aesthetics, the most useful remains Katherine Gilbert, "Cassirer's Placement of Art," in The Philosophy of Ernst Cassirer, ed. P. A. Schilpp (Evanston, IL: Library of Living Philosophers, Inc., 1949), 607-30; see also the essays that follow it in this volume by Harry Slochower and Konstantin Reichardt, which concern Cassirer's view of literature. A book- length study that relies on Cassirer's views of art and the connection among art, religion, and myth is Edward G. Ballard, Art and Analysis: An Essay Toward a The- ory in Aesthetics (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1957). In more recent literature on Cassirer, see J. M. Krois, Cassirer: Symbolic Forms and History (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 1987), 131-33; and S. G. Lofts, Ernst Cassirer: A "Repeti- tion" of Modernity (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2000), chap. 7. Lofts's chapter offers the most sustained exposition of art as one of Cassirer's symbolic forms. Articles specifically related to Cassirer's conception of art as symbolic form are E. Schaper, "The Art Symbol," British Journal of Aesthetics 4 (1964): 228-39; T. A. Buesch, "The Literary Genre as Symbolic Form," Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism 31 (1973): 525-30; S. Morawski, "Art as Semblance," Journal of Philosophy 81 (1984): 654-63; and N. Woltersdorf, "Art in an Idealist Perspective," Idealistic Studies 15 (1985): 87-99. The one figure in aesthetics who has especially been influenced by Cassirer is Susanne Langer. She was not, as is often thought, a student of Cassirer. Mrs. Toni Cassirer describes Cassirer's con- tact with Susanne Langer in Mein Leben mit Ernst Cassirer (Hildesheim: Gersten- berg Verlag, 1981), 314-15. The one full study of Cassirer and Langer is William Schultz, Cassirer and Langer on Myth: An Introduction (New York: Garland, 2000). 9. I have considered the implications of Cassirer's general philosophy of culture for education in two articles: "Conduct and Culture: Dewey and Cassirer," Edu- cational Change (Spring 2000): 21-31, and "Dewey and Cassirer: A Postscript," Educational Change (Spring 2001-2002): 19-27. There is an early article by Theo- dore Brameld, "Philosophical Anthropology: The Educational Significance of Ernst Cassirer," Harvard Educational Review 26 (1956): 207-32. This, however, is a broad discussion of Cassirer's views that expresses some reservations about their application to education based on an interpretation of the philosophy of symbolic forms as a type of neo-Kantianism, an approach that has been much modified in more recent scholarship on Cassirer. 10.
