<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES L. KASTELY Convention, Necessity, and the Concept of Literature I. RECENTLY THE CRITICAL COMMUNITY has rediscov- ered the rhetorical dimension of critical activ- ity. 1 In part, this is a recovery of what it means to be a community; in part, it is a renewed understanding that criticism is a mode of action; and in part, it is a discovery of the convention- ality of the concept of literature. These truths have led to a change in the critical community's understanding of the concept of literature and to an increased awareness of the role of the critic in the constitution of literature as an object. In a rhetorically understood criticism, the critic is no longer simply a discoverer or explicator of a text whose value is somehow internal to it; rather, the text's value is understood as at least partly a product of the critic's values. This understanding of literature returns a responsi- bility to the critic that was lost when critics considered the text as autonomous. Critics like Terry Eagleton and Frank Lentricchia have be- gun to explore the social responsibilities that become apparent once criticism is understood to be a rhetorical activity.2 But another aspect of this new responsibility of the critic has not been given sufficient attention. When critics con- ceive of literature as a conventional concept, can they locate and justify a set of constraints for the activity of interpretation? Is the critic in any way bound to the text before him or her? Does a critic have any responsibilities that follow from the activity of reading when that activity is conceived rhetorically? In what way, if any, does the text, conceived as a product of a communal interpretive effort, limit a critic? Perhaps Stanley Fish, more than anyone else, has raised these questions. The difficulties en- JAMES L. KASTELY is assistant professor of English at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. countered by his answers in Is There a Text in This Class? are an instructive place to begin to recover some of the necessity that inheres in the concept of literature even when it is conceived as being grounded in and by convention. In Is There a Text in This Class? Stanley Fish asks: if criticism starts from the response of the reader, how is a knowledge of literature possi- ble? He answers that knowledge of literature is grounded in the conventions that readers pos- sess. For him critical understanding is a func- tion of membership in a community, and the critic is a rhetorician who seeks not to discover truth but to confirm or change beliefs. Fish casts his inquiry rhetorically as an investigation into how an existing institution-in his case, litera- ture-is maintained and transformed by its various communities: The business of criticism, in other words, [is] not to decide between interpretations by subjecting them to the test of disinterested evidence but to establish by political and persuasive means (they are the same thing) the set of interpretive assumptions from the vantage of which the evidence (and the facts and the intentions and everything else) will hereafter be specifiable.' Fish's choice of rhetoric as the architectonic critical art was his solution to a dilemma that arose from his attempts to see the reader as a source of literary meaning yet to prevent this interest in the reader from becoming an autho- rization for an uncontrolled subjectivity. Fish wanted both to dislodge the text as the source of literary meaning yet to keep it as the source of critical authority (Fish, p. 7). His way out of this dilemma was to reject the concern with subjectivity, inherited from the New Critics, and to embrace through a new set of categories the problems of the individual's participation in and contribution to literary experience. He ?) 1987 The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism</page><page sequence="2">286 KASTELY eliminated the subjective/objective dichotomy by conceiving literature as a conventional rather than a natural category. This shift transformed the critic's task from the scientific one of knowing literature to the rhetorical one of inventing it: Literature, I argue, is a conventional category. What will, at any time, be recognized as literature is a function of a communal decision as to what will count as literature. All texts have the potential of so counting, in that it is possible to regard any stretch of language in such a way that it will display those properties presently understood to be literary. In other words, it is not that literature exhibits certain formal properties that compel a certain kind of attention; rather, paying a certain kind of attention (as defined by what literature is understood to be) results in the emergence into noticeability of the properties we know in advance to be literary. The conclusion is that while literature is still a category, it is an open category, not definable by fictionality, or by a disregard of propositional truth, or by a predominance of tropes and figures, but simply by what we decide to put into it (Fish, pp. 10-1 1). What prevents this understanding of literature from being irredeemably subjective (where sub- jectivity is conceived as the problem of an unconstrained reader) is that community has replaced or, more correctly, redefined the con- cept of the reader as a self, for the self is now conceived as public and conventional rather than as private or natural. Selves are no longer free agents responsible to nothing other than their own whims and predilections; they are, instead, members of communities who are bound by the assumptions and agreements of those communities. Similarly, texts are no longer independent and determinant entities, for they too are products of communal decision. Consequently, all literary knowledge is com- munal, which is to say that all literary knowl- edge is founded on and remains within conven- tion. Fish then goes on to distinguish types of criticism according to their role in either affirm- ing or changing the conventions through which critics understand literature. Critics can either engage in the ordinary practice of appealing to beliefs already held to establish their particular claims, or they can challenge the basis of these beliefs. This reformulation of criticism in terms of invention leads Fish to proclaim a new opening for criticism: "This meant that the business of criticism was not (as I had previ- ously thought) to determine a correct way of reading but to determine from which of a number of possible perspectives reading will proceed" (Fish, p. 16). Criticism as rhetoric is defined not in terms of reading but in terms of writing: Indeed, it is interpretive communities, rather than the text or the reader, that produce meanings and are responsible for the emergence of formal features. Interpretive communities are made up of those who share interpretive strategies not for reading but for writing texts, for constituting their properties (Fish, p. 16). This is not to say that consensus is unimpor- tant in Fish's rhetoric, for, like any rhetorician, he seeks an effective art, and this means one that persuades. Still the problem that excites him is not how a critic gets others to believe what he believes (this problem is peculiarly uninteresting for him), but how a critic induces (invents) literary forms in particular situations. Here the role of the reader, now a communal and conventional self possessed of strategies for writing texts, is crucial. Readers are not only members of interpretive communities but also creatures distinguished by their ability to give meaning to a situation. The informing problem for criticism as a rhetorical art is how to interpret a text, which, in turn, means how to invent a text. This discovery of the centrality of invention, however, leaves Fish with a new version of his earlier problem, for it seems to rob criticism of a controlling authority. To deal with the skep- tical charge that there are no inherent con- straints on his concept of literature, Fish turns to the role of situation in human understanding to establish the possibility for an agreement in judgments that is not grounded on appeals to a pre-existing and independently determinate text. Situations are properties of communities and are available to individuals only if they are members of that particular community (Fish, p. 304). This is another way of saying that the community is always interested, always in- volved with human purposes. Situations are important because they are the occasions or the motivations for action, and for this reason, they are always pre-structured. Readers do not first have situations that they supply with meaning; rather, "to be in a situation is to see the words</page><page sequence="3">Convention, Necessity 287 . . . as already meaningful" (Fish, p. 313). This is what it means for the self to be inher- ently communal: there is never a time when someone is not in some community, for selves are always situated. An individual self has no choice of whether or not to be a member of a community; his or her only choice is whether or not to belong to a particular community. Because readers are members of certain com- munities, they possess the particular interpre- tive strategies of those communities. A partic- ular reader knows the character of, say, a literary situation because he or she gives that character to the situation. Interpretations impart rather than uncover an identity: acts of recognition, rather than being triggered by formal characteristics, are their source. It is not that the presence of poetic qualities compels a certain kind of attention, but that the paying of a certain kind of attention results in the emergence of poetic qualities (Fish, p. 326). Because readers possess certain interests, pur- poses, and practices, they understand and ex- pect the world to be a certain way. A reader's values and abilities pre-determine what he or she will see. Fish thus sees definitions of poetry as "recipes, for by directing readers as to what to look for in a poem, they instruct them in ways of looking that will produce what they expect to see" (Fish, p. 327). This is to return to the idea that interpretation is writing and not reading, invention and not recovery. "Interpre- tation is not the art of construing but the art of constructing. Interpreters do not decode poems; they make them" (Fish, p. 327). Since readers cannot escape being situated, they cannot fail to recognize (that is, to write) a text as a literary work. But although a reader's success is now guaranteed, he still lacks any meaningful standard to evaluate his interpreta- tions, so the problem of a constrained but irresponsible reading remains. This, however, is not a problem that Fish acknowledges. He argues that a community will always exercise an in-fact control, for any interpretation will have to be heard within a particular community, and consequently it will have to speak to those interests and to accord with that community's purposes and practices. Although there are no absolute beginnings or ends in Fish's universe, communities do have histories; there are estab- lished customs or conventions, and these set the conditions for persuasion, for criticism moves through a dialectic of opposition to established positions. If a critic seeks to persuade others of his interpretation, he can do so only by means of the values they hold; therefore, these values will control the acceptance of his interpretation. Still, this control is only over the critic's ability to communicate his invention; it does not speak to the legitimacy or the possibility of the inven- tion itself. More correctly, the legitimacy of an interpretation is now exclusively a function of the critic's capacity to persuade a particular community. But since, by definition, a critic will always be within some community, all interpretations are necessarily self-legitimatiz- ing. Because the self is always communal, all interpretations must tautologically bring with them communities. Thus a community's accep- tance of an interpretation cannot logically serve as a ground to distinguish the worth of an interpretation. Although the community is the ultimate critical authority for Fish, he provides us no way to distinguish responsible from irresponsible communities (it is not clear that such a distinction would finally have meaning for him), so community as a standard does little to advance a solution to the problem of irre- sponsible reading.4 Indeed, given this assurance of the inherent success of any critical perfor- mance, it becomes a question whether there would remain a motive for doing criticism or, for that matter, for reading the criticism of others. The problem of an irresponsible reading is also raised by the most radical contention of Fish's critical theory, for the only recognized limit to invention is the critic's imagination. Fish argues this point through two hypothetical and intentionally extravagant examples. He shows how "A Rose for Emily" could be read as a story about Eskimos and how Mr. Collins could be considered as the non-ironic hero of Pride and Prejudice. Fish's point is not to endorse these readings (if he could, they would lose their force as examples), but to show them as possibilities. For him, the issue is theoretical and concerns the infinite possibilities of inven- tion: "It follows, then, that no reading, how- ever outlandish it might appear, is inherently an impossible one" (Fish, p. 347). This capacity to invent becomes the critic's</page><page sequence="4">288 KASTELY glory-central not only to the institution of criticism but also to the institution of literature. Indeed, the institution of criticism, conceived as a rhetorical activity, is now what makes literature possible: No longer is the critic the humble servant of texts whose glories exist independently of anything he might do; it is what he does, within the constraints embedded in the literary institution, that brings texts into being and makes them available for analysis and apprecia- tion. The practice of literary criticism is not something one must apologize for; it is absolutely essential not only to the maintenance of, but to the very production of, the objects of its attention (Fish, p. 368). Criticism becomes the source of literature, which is another way of saying that literature is conventional-it comes into existence by our acts of calling it literature. But to say that literature is conventional is not yet to place it definitively, for Fish recognizes two senses of convention: [There is] the stricter sense by which illocutionary acts are constitutive rather than regulative, and the looser sense (roughly equivalent to "accepted practice") em- ployed by literary critics when they talk, for example, of conventions of narrative (Fish, p. 223). The first and stricter sense of convention is that of philosophical inquiry. This sense of conven- tion conceives of the possibility of an institution as rooted in a set of agreements that are the grounds or the conditions for that institution's existence. The second or looser sense of con- vention leads to a sociological inquiry in which literature is seen as an institution that has been shaped historically by the ideologies of taste as they were embodied in the principles and prac- tices of writers and critics. This sense of con- vention does not account for the possibility of the institution; it only explains why an institu- tion has its present characteristics. The first sense of convention is a register of necessity; the second of accident. Clearly, for Fish, the conventions that ground our understanding of literature must be the second of these two senses. Since his critical model is one of invention, one of the critic's tasks, indeed, that which is most highly valued by the community, is "to redefine and reshape its configurations" (Fish, p. 366). Now the stricter sense of convention is applied to the conditions of the illocutionary force of a performative utterance. Speech-act inquiries do not seek, for example, to argue what the best conditions for a promise are; rather, they are investigations of conditions under which one can be said to have promised. They are explo- rations into the nature of an institution, not attempts to alter its function. Further, this institution seems rooted in a way that literature is not. Fish points to this difference by looking at the problem of violation (Fish, p. 223). If one violates the speech-act conventions for a prom- ise, he or she has failed to make a promise. The conventions constrain the conditions of their employment. On the other hand, to violate the conventions of literature is merely to replace one convention with an alternative. The history of literature is rich with writers violating, say, the conventions of narrative and in the process discovering new ways of telling a story. This possibility of creative violation is what allows literature to be an open category-its conven- tions are derived rather than given. If this is the case, then the critic is free theoretically to reinterpret these conventions. He is not guilty of performing an unintelligible act; instead, he is challenging a community's way of seeing with the intention of increasing the richness of its sight.5 But does this conclusion leave any content for the concept of literature? Beginning from the truth that literary conventions can be al- tered, the argument has moved to the position that they have little integrity and can be changed at the whim of the writer and ultimately of the critic. Fish would immediately explain that this should not cause alarm, for if writers and critics desire an audience, they must act responsibly and show due respect to the convention they are challenging. So in practice things work out. This, however, is an inadequate reassurance because it trades on the tautology of the self being communal. There is no inherent necessity within the concept of literature that might re- strict any community from using it any way that it chooses. Fish can take comfort in this con- clusion because he believes that since any critic will desire an audience, that he or she will act in line with that community's standards. But this practical reassurance rests finally on Fish's analysis theoretically eliminating the possibility of serious failure. Fish does not believe that we</page><page sequence="5">Convention, Necessity 289 should worry about an aberrant or incompre- hensible or irresponsible interpretation because his grounding interpretation in the conventional nature of the community has, by definition, eliminated these as problems. But such a con- ception of convention returns us ineluctably to the problems of a lack of a set of constraints, for it provides no meaningful basis to evaluate differing communal interpretations. In denying that skepticism is a serious possibility, Fish obviates the philosophical difficulties that at- tend an understanding of literature as a concept grounded in and by human conventions. To understand his mistake and to begin to return some content and hence some necessity to the concept of literature, I will inquire into the strange necessity that Fish's denial of skepti- cism has caused him to miss. II. Stanley Cavell's The Claim of Reason ad- dresses the philosophical problems raised by grounding knowledge in convention. At times, however, he sounds very much like Fish. In his discussion of modernism, for example, Cavell stresses the inventive aspect of modem art: If it is the task of the modernist artist to show that we do not know a, priori what will count for us as an instance of his art, this task, or fate, would be incom- prehensible, or unexercisable, apart from the existence of objects which, prior to any new effort, we do not count as such instances as matter of course; and apart from their being conditions which our criteria take to define such objects. Only someone outside the enter- prise could think of it as the exploration of mere conventions. One might rather think of it as (the necessity for) establishing new conventions.6 So far, so good. It looks as if Cavell is recognizing that art functions rhetorically, for what appears to be going on is a reinvention of the conditions of art. The standard appears to be the community's decision (what will count for us), and this standard seems located in history (we do not know a priori). Cavell, however, unlike Fish, does not locate final authority in the community; rather, as the paragraph contin- ues, nature becomes a source of authority: And only someone outside this enterprise could think of establishing new conventions as a matter of exercising personal decision or taste. One might rather think of it as the exploration or education or enjoyment or chas- tisement of taste and of decision and of intuition, an exploration of the kind of creature in whom such capacities are exercised. Artists are people who know how to do such things: i.e., how to make objects in response to which we are enabled, but also fated, to explore and educate and enjoy and chastise our capac- ities as they stand. Underlying the tyranny of conven- tion is the tyranny of nature (Claim, p. 123). This grounding of convention in nature marks Cavell's serious and fundamental dis- agreement with Fish. At issue is whether the openness of a conventional and hence commu- nal understanding is theoretically bounded or unbounded. For Fish, such understanding is theoretically unbounded, and nature itself exists only as another convention; for Cavell, conven- tions are tied in a complex way to a nature that precedes them and to which they are account- able. Cavell does not see the fact of convention as evidence of our radical divorce from the world but rather as a register of how we are in the world. Convention is our connection to, rather than severance from, nature. Still, Cavell's account of convention might seem at first to do away with the need for the community to be an authorizing agency for its institutions because the community's chief in- tellectual task would be one of acknowledgment or recognition, as indeed it is in Cavell's universe. However, such activities are neither simple nor passive; rather, through these activ- ities we come to know who we are and what we share. We discover those forms of life that enable us to live the life that we do-to be the kind of creature we are. The community be- comes important because it is we, as members of the community, who must finally accept responsibility for our world. And it is our responsibility for this world that makes the problem of convention philosophically interest- ing for Cavell, for we must ask who are members of our community, and this becomes an inquiry into our nature that necessarily in- volves us with discovering our powers and limits. In Fish's analysis, there is a limit to what is an acceptable interpretation, but the limit is determined solely by the present standards of the community. The control is based in acci- dent; that is, it is rooted in the history of the community's taste. Theoretically, the projec-</page><page sequence="6">290 KASTELY tion of meaning is unlimited. This is what Fish's two intentionally absurd readings are designed to prove. But for Cavell the limit of meaning is not determined solely by current standards of communal acceptance; rather, the control of our projections is a consequence of our nature, of our situation. Not all interpreta- tions are even theoretically possible: But though language-what we call language-is tol- erant, allows projection, not just any projection will be acceptable, i.e., will communicate. Language is equally definitively intolerant-as love is tolerant and intolerant of differences, as materials or organisms are of stress, as communities are of deviation as arts or sciences are of variation. While it is true that we must use the same word in, project a word into, various contexts (must be willing to call some contexts the same), it is equally true that what will count as a legitimate projection is deeply controlled (Claim, p. 183). The contrast between Fish and Cavell's views of the basis of agreement is clear in their different understandings of the category of the normal. Again, they frame their inquiries along lines that may be called respectively sociologi- cal and philosophical. Fish defines the normal as those values and practices that are accepted by the community and consequently that form the categories from which its members imme- diately and unconsciously view the world. The normal is the agreed upon. Because the normal constitutes the community and its values and expectations, it becomes the standard by which the community judges the acceptability of an interpretation. In this respect, the normal is an evaluative category, for values create facts. The ultimate ground of the values is the com- munity's decision to hold them as values. The evaluative function is founded on a conscious or unconscious legislative act that convenes the community. The critic's task is not to explore how the normal is rooted in nature but to investigate the relations between the currently held standard and more innovative interpreta- tions. As historians, critics are to interpret the dynamics of the communities' changing tastes; as rhetoricians, they are to shape the standards of taste; and as historians who are rhetoricians, their standards of taste will shape the interpre- tations of the community's story. In contrast, the ultimate grounding of what is considered normal in Cavell's system is cate- gorical and not legislative. When he considers the case of a man whose screams appear to show he is in pain, but, on further review, these screams turn out to be this man's way of calling his hamsters, Cavell says that he will not give up our ideas about pain-behavior (our normal understanding) but will exclude this man from our world, at least with respect to pain: For we shall no longer call his screaming, etc., pain- behavior; which means that we will not, confronted with such a phenomenon, give up our usual notion of what pain-behavior is. That is to say, we may rule this man out of our world of pain. In this respect he will not exist for us. In response to him there will doubtless be more that we feel shaky about than our knowledge of when he is and is not in pain. But as before, these doubts about him are limited to him, and have no tendency to make us wonder whether we ever can be sure (Claim, p. 89). Our exclusion of this man is not voluntary; it would make no sense to consider his case as an appeal to the community's tolerance or even to its possible plural understanding of pain. There is necessity to the concept of pain because we are the kind of people we are, and this necessity is the philosophical crux of the problem of convention. When we rule on this case of bizarre behavior, it is to discover if this is a case of what we recognize as pain. Can this partic- ular case be brought under our category of pain? If not, our responses, at least with respect to it as pain-behavior, are at an end. The impossi- bility of meeting this type of person is the same as the impossibility of bringing somebody into language who does not already possess the capacity for language. It is not that our wills fail us, but that we have no idea of how to go about doing this. We suffer from neither misunder- standing nor imperfect sympathy, but from incomprehension. A violation of our conven- tions of pain-behavior throws us back upon ourselves, and we are charged with the respon- sibility of acknowledging or denying a creature's humanity. This responsibility gives force to the skeptical problem of other minds, for at issue is the adequacy of our response in the presence of what is other. And the theoret- ical openness for change that is part of Fish's account of the normal is not available to us, for we are not free with respect to the demand to recognize or not recognize another's pain. This is not a situation in which we merely express a</page><page sequence="7">Convention, Necessity 291 preference; rather, it is a situation in which we must face or evade a responsibility for ourselves or for another. Behind Cavell's concept of the normal lies the peculiar concept of necessity that locates necessity in the human. Cavell refers to this necessity as anthropomorphic. Such a recogni- tion of necessity as anthropomorphic might at first seem to reduce this necessity to a hypo- thetical instrumentality. If a person seeks a certain end (for example, to be accepted by his or her fellow man), then that person must act in ways that the other accepts. Such necessity is truly necessary, but only if the particular end is adopted. This is one way to read the choice Fish allows the literary critic with respect to mem- bership in the critical community. This view of the state of affairs would make the critic's participation optional; however, Cavell's ac- count leaves no such options: For the phenomena which constitute the criteria of something's being so are fully in the nature of things- they are part of those very general facts of nature or of human life against the background of which our con- cepts mean anything at all, and in particular, mean something about what we call "the nature of things" or "the world" (Claim, p. 106). This necessity, then, is located not in what we want (so it cannot be a function of the end that we choose) but in who we are (it is thus a place at which our nature is revealed). Our knowl- edge of this necessity is grounded in the expe- riences we have. Still, this understanding of necessity does not posit a conception of the human that precedes experience. There is no necessity in our having the particular experi- ences that we do, but for us to have these experiences only certain forms of life can be available to us. This nature that authorizes the necessity of our conventions certainly cannot be some inde- pendently specifiable set of facts, for facts only exist because we are the way we are. Agree- ments precede facts, not facts agreements. Cavell says, "This [our making something 'x' by calling it 'x'I explicitly makes our agreement in judgment, our attunement expressed through criteria, agreement in valuing. So that what can be communicated, say a fact, depends upon agreement in our valuing, rather than the other way around" (Claim, p. 94). For agreement to take place, we must share values, and to share values means to be mutually attuned. Cavell uses the idea of mutual attunement to bring out several aspects of agreement. To begin with, it means that we do not achieve agreements by empirical procedures, for such agreements are not necessary; they are, at best, probable. But to be attuned is to agree because we are on the same wavelength, because we vibrate at the same frequency. As Cavell points out, to be wrong in this type of agreement is not to be mistaken about a fact of the world but to be "soul muddled" (Claim, p. 180). Also this metaphor of attunement explains why the nor- mal is finally a categorical rather than a legis- lative concept for Cavell. Either you are or you are not in the same frequency with me. If you are not, the only way we can get together is for you to somehow enter my wavelength, or for me to enter yours. Judgments are internal to frequency. The idea of mutual attunement becomes still clearer when we look to Cavell's analogy be- tween these judgments of agreement and Kant's notion of a judgment of taste. In each there is the problem of subjectivity: If we say that the hope of agreement motivates our engaging in these various patterns of support, then we must also say, what I take Kant to have seen, that even were agreement in fact to emerge, our judgments, so far as aesthetic, would remain as essentially subjective, as they ever were. Otherwise, art and the criticism of art would not have their special importance nor elicit their own forms of distrust and of gratitude. The problem of the critic, as of the artist, is not to discount his subjectivity, but to include it; not to overcome it in agreement, but to master it in exemplary ways.7 The self draws from its own experiences, but it draws on these experiences in such a way that what is of interest is not the personal, the private, or the accidental, but the communal, the public, the necessary. In ways that are not true for Fish, Cavell's concept of convention makes it possible to seriously risk the self, for the community is only achieved and advanced by artistic and critical investigations of commu- nal bounds. And this possibility of communal extension and limits is what makes the problem of isolation acquire its philosophical dimension. For it is now theoretically and practically pos- sible for oneself or another to be outside of the human community. This possibility arises be-</page><page sequence="8">292 KASTELY cause our test for this type of claim about the nature of our experience cannot be empirical. We know what is human (for us) by testing it on ourselves. This possibility of failure is the irreducible origin of the problem of skepticism as to other minds. The problem is not one of disinterested knowing but rather of appropriate response-the issue is not epistemological but experiential. Cavell's problem of the necessity of our conventions creates a sense of limit that Fish does not and cannot explore. For, given Cavell's understanding of convention, no one is wholly free, even in a theoretical sense, be- cause the experience compels attention. A per- son is answerable not merely to a community but to the experience. This responsibility to experience is the tyranny of nature; and it is over the recognition of this responsibility that Fish and Cavell disagree. For Fish, the commu- nity is the final source of authority; for Cavell, we understand who we are as a community- our powers and limits-by learning how we name a situation. There is something that ex- ists, if not independent of us-for we are needed to call it into existence-at least apart from us. We cannot call it anything we like or pay attention to it in any way we choose. Within our agreements and underlying them is always the process of mapping the mind onto the world or the world onto the mind. Both language and world are grammatical, and their connecting link is convention. And despite or because of its centrality, Cavell's notion of convention is haunted by a paradox of being accidental and necessary at one and the same time. As a term it stands both for the human contribution in the world we know and for the natural limits or control that the world places on human freedom. Because we are a creature deeply formed by convention, things are the way they are for us. For Cavell, the interesting sense of conven- tion then is not its capacity to create worlds by fiat but its responsibility to an order beyond human will. He thus distinguishes between two types of questions we can raise about a conven- tion: If the basis you offer in support of your identification of a specific object invokes inappropriate criteria, then one response we cited was "But that's not what is officially or conventionally called a such-and-such; you've been taught the wrong name"; and to support this we may appeal to an official manual or to our expertise. But if you have to say "But that's not (what it's called) pointing to the color, 'explaining the meaning,' etc.," there is no such appeal. We are equal with respect to such claims; not equal in the ability to challenge and clarify, but equal in the right to ask and answer (Claim, p. 110). In the first type of question the problem is a lack of information, and the solution is to appeal to the community's authorized use. The authority of the convention is grounded in the com- munity's decision to use the word in that way. This type of question focuses on problems of agreement within a community, and conse- quently the community is the authority that can resolve disputes or clarify use. But for the questions about convention which interest Cavell, the community cannot play this role. So to what can the community appeal in those cases when disputes arise or education is necessary? Where can the community locate authority? Cavell's answer is a peculiar one: we can reply indifferently that the authority is either in ourselves or in the world. The passage that I find most helpful in understanding this claim is Cavell's asking and answering one of Wittgenstein's questions: "Could someone have a feeling of ardent love or hope [or expectancy or joy or belief or profound pleasure of causation] for the space of one second-no matter what preceded or followed this second?" (583). And the answer he [Wittgenstein] apparently expects is, No. It could not, in the nature of things, be love, hope, etc. (Claim, p. 106). This example is best understood in the context of Cavell's earlier notion that our agreements (based in our conventions) are analogous to Kant's judgments of taste. In each case, the ground upon which they are tested is the self. Try to imagine a passion with no history and no development. Wouldn't any answer be violation of the concept of passion? Further, the violation is not a mere transgression against accepted usage (as it would have to be for Fish). In the first sense of convention, if one violates it, he is wrong in the way he uses the word. But if one violates convention in this second sense (and it is difficult to imagine successfully such a vio- lation), he is not wrong; he is incomprehensi-</page><page sequence="9">Convention, Necessity 293 ble. If there were a creature who claimed to have passions that have no histories, would we-could we-recognize that creature as hu- man, as one whose community we could mean- ingfully enter. Again, we are returned to the notion of the control of our conventions being deep. Consequently, in the second sense, "'conventions' are not patterns of life which differentiate human beings from one another, but those exigencies of conduct and feeling which all humans share" (Claim, p. 111). Cavell and Fish disagree then over the rootedness of convention. Fish would end any inquiry about convention by a community's agreement to use the convention in a certain way. He places no inherent constraints on the reasons by which the community is persuaded to accept a particular use of the convention as a standard for what is normal. He is confident that all significant questions about conventions can be handled by placing the questions back into common and practical contexts. He sees no need for a justification that would go beyond these contexts. As he admits, the strategy of his argument is to show that fears about a radical and destructive skepticism are groundless: To put the matter in a slightly different way: radical skepticism is a possibility only if the mind exists independently of its furnishing, of the categories of understanding that inform it; but if, as I have been arguing, the mind is constituted by those categories, there is not possibility of achieving the distance from them that would make them available to a skeptical inquiry. In short, one cannot, properly speaking, be a skeptic, and one cannot be a skeptic for the same reason that one cannot be a relativist, because one cannot achieve the distance from his own beliefs and assump- tions that would result in their being no more authori- tative for him than the beliefs and assumptions held by others or the beliefs and assumptions he himself used to hold. The conclusion is tautological but inescapable: one believes what one believes, and one does so without reservation. The reservation inherent in the general position I have been arguing-that one's beliefs and therefore one's assumptions are always subject to change-has no real force, since until a change occurs the interpretation that seems self-evident to me will continue to seem so, no matter how many previous changes I can recall (Fish, pp. 360-61). Readers are inescapably held in a web of convention: they may change or abandon the particular conventions that enable them to be the kind of creature they are, but they can never reach the skeptic's position of standing outside all conventions. Skepticism is not a position that can be lived, so Fish can dismiss it on practical grounds. But is he right in this dismissal? What would be a reason for choosing either his or Cavell's account? One way to answer these questions would be to determine whether a skeptical questioning can arise out of the ordinary con- texts in which readers encounter literature. When one reads (critically), can he or she become seriously skeptical about some aspect of the conventional expectations for literary experience? It seems to me that the answer is "yes, he or she can," and that such experiences are not rare. Further, their occurrence is essen- tial to the institution of criticism. Earlier I quoted Cavell on Kant's claim that aesthetic judgment is grounded in subjectivity, and I argued that this claim was helpful in allowing us to see the force of convention. But Kant's claim also opens up skepticism in aesthetic (and therefore in literary) judgments. Cavell pro- vides a good example of a live skeptical doubt when he considers how a listener might stand in relation to atonal music. When confronted by an atonal piece that makes a claim to being music, a listener will try the claim out by seeing if he can find a significant sharing between the atonal piece and what he has up to this moment called music. When attending to such an atonal piece, it makes sense (it can occur naturally) to ask "Is this music?" And the answer (either yes or no) can include a person within or isolate him from a community. Let us assume that the listener succeeds in hearing the atonal piece as music. As Cavell points out, the problem then of whether it is music will disappear (for that listener): Moreover, but still perhaps even more rarely, we may find ourselves within the experience of such composi- tions, following them; and then the question whether this is music and the problem of its tonal sense, will be-not answered or solved, but rather they will disappear, seem irrelevant (Must We Mean, p.84). But if he is alone in his success, even momen- tarily, he must encounter a serious skeptical doubt: "Am I wrong as to this piece's being music, and if so, what confidence can I have in my judgment?" This critical position seems paradigmatic to much of art at the margin, and it is evidence of the serious risks in an art</page><page sequence="10">294 KASTELY criticism that explores the bounds of artistic or critical expression. One strength of Cavell's analysis of the role of convention in art and criticism is that he makes clear what is at stake in these enterprises. As Cavell points out, the skeptic is alone at the moment of doubt, and this isolation is essential to the doubt. The skeptical experience is the feeling of being closed off from the world or from others, and it arises from the natural temptation to go beyond convention to the thing-in-itself. It registers the basic human de- sire to escape from the human condition. Its occurrence raises recurring questions about our knowledge of ourselves. For Cavell, "the prob- lems of philosophy become questions of self- knowledge" (Claim, p. 240). For him, the fact that it is we who mean through our conventions carries with it the problem of our avoiding or acknowledging others. Such an enterprise car- ries with it the possibility of serious failure. Cavell's understanding of convention opens up a possibility for recovering an understanding of literature that Fish's account forecloses. For Fish, literature is anything that a critic chooses to call literature, but for Cavell, this calling is deeply controlled. For Cavell there is an integ- rity to conventions like narrrative because they are forms of life that impose a discipline on those who possess them and who are possessed by them, and that they make possible a creativ- ity for those who participate within them. To understand the history of the concept of litera- ture only as the recording of an accidental development is to commit an error of abstrac- tion; it is to move outside our experience and to see collective and individual experience as mere exigency. This is finally to try to escape respon- sibility for language and culture rather than to ask how this language and culture reveal us. Cavell allows us to recover a central motive for the study of literature, for as we live within and through the conventions of our literature and explore the worlds they create, we are engaged in a disciplining of our powers and a confront- ing of our limits. Cavell's understanding of convention argues that there is a limit to the critical imagination other than its concern with a potential audience, for a particular experience must invite the projection of strategies of interpretation. There is a necessity to what compels our attention. This is true of art as well as language: an object or activity or event onto or into which a concept is projected, must invite or allow that projec- tion; in the way in which, for an object to be (called) an art object it must allow or invite the experience and behavior which are appropriate or necessary to our concepts of the appreciation or contemplation or ab- sorption . . . of an art object. What kind of object will allow or invite or be fit for that contemplation, etc., is no more accidental or arbitrary than what kind of object will be fit to serve as (what we call) a "shoe" (Claim, p. 183). This limitation on projection is not to deny the inherent openness of a concept, for, as Cavell goes on to say, there is more than one way of being shod. But there are not an infinite number of ways; not anything we call a "shoe" is a "shoe." There are controls on our use of this concept; there are contexts (situations) into which the concept will not project-i.e., that we, as a community, cannot project it. For one thing, whatever we call a shoe must be capable of being worn on a foot (or understood meta- phorically or analogically in respect to this capacity). Again, it is not necessary that we have shoes; however, if we do, it is necessary that they have certain properties. There is a grammar to our imaginative projections, and it is this grammar that allows the ordinary lan- guage philosopher to offer his or her readers an invitation to suppose. The invitation- "what should you say if. . . "-generates the material for philosophical analysis by revealing the con- ventions that control how the reader means. It is in this respect of having a grammar of imaginative projection that literature can be an open category. Although literature is capable of multiple understanding, its openness is not the emptiness of no theoretical limits. An under- standing of literature as a conventional institu- tion constrained by a grammar of imaginative projection commits a critic neither to a belief that the concept of literature is capable of a complete and final definition, nor to the belief that criticism is authorized by free-standing texts that render it an objective activity. There is room for change and innovation in Cavell's understanding of how conventions work (and this change is not apprehensible a priori). But this change or innovation is still responsible to the concept that it seeks to redefine. If family resemblances are not capable of being stated in</page><page sequence="11">Convention, Necessity 295 a unilaterally satisfying way that renders them universal, this does not mean that they are theoretically unlimited. It is not necessary that we have literature; but if we have that form of life that we call literature, then critics are not free, even theoretically, to claim membership in that form for anything they choose to put there. It is important to return briefly to Fish's distinction between the conventional institu- tions of promising and narrating and to the conclusions he drew from violations of their respective conventions. He considered the con- ventions of promising constitutive because a violation of them led to a nonperformance and thus to a nonoccurrence of a promise. This seemed to contrast with the conventions of narrative which were regulative and could be violated with the result that a critic or writer might be led to a new understanding of the possibility of narrative. But do these examples really point to a distinction in kind or to a distinction in degree to which the particular set of conventions is subject to alternative formu- lations? That Fish's examples may not prove what he hopes becomes clear when one realizes that not any violation of narrative will be understood as a violation of a narrative. If I randomly scramble words and then place the results together and call my procedure narra- tive, it is an open question whether my claim will be granted. First, I will have to account somehow for why it is a violation of narrative and not of exposition or drama or some other literary form. I will have to explain its relation to telling. Second, not any explanation will work. One can agree with Fish that a critic could be inventive enough to come up with some account, but this is not the end of the issue. For the significant theoretical interest is not with how some procedure could be made sense of, but with whether the procedure does work. When you and I try to read my new narrative, does it produce an experience that is capable of engaging us? Can we really pay attention to it? It is important to realize that logical possibility is finally not appropriate to aesthetic concerns, for our aesthetic judgments are after-the-fact and the appeal is not to what is possible but to what occurs (and this is an appeal to who we are). If the violation of narrative fails to meet either of our tests, then we will not recognize it (we will not be able to project it) as a reinvention or extension of narrative. A failure of the first test means the claim is incomprehensible; a failure of the second means the claim is false. Narrative then is as much a constitutive category as promising, and it imposes limits on our ability to deploy it.8 This understanding of narrative as a conven- tion as governed by a grammar of imaginative projection provides a way to meet one of Fish's major concerns: the role of criticism in the preservation and extension of the institution of literature. It is possible to agree with Fish that the critic is engaged in a continual probing of what is literature, but now to recover, in a way that Fish cannot, an understandable motive for such actions. The critic's experiences compel such inquiries. There is a possibility of both freedom and responsibility (and consequently of irresponsibility) in this practice of criticism, for one can always refuse to give heed to the urgency of experience, but there is equally a sense that the need to criticize the experience is involuntary, for the experience demands that the critic interpret it and that he offer his interpretation to others to see if he and they share a form of life. One task of literary theory becomes to explore and test the imaginative projections of the concept of literature, and in the ensuing communal discussions to shape the communal understanding of literary conven- tions. 1 See, for example, Terry Eagleton, Literary Theory: An Introduction (Minneapolis, 1983), pp. 194-217. 2 Eagleton; Frank Lentricchia, Criticism and Social Change (Chicago, 1983). 3 Stanley Fish, Is There a Text in This Class? (Cambridge, 1980), p. 16. 4 Fish allows for the possibility of an irresponsible reading, but such irresponsibility is a decision within a community. This solution, however, simply raises the further question of why grant authority to one community over another. ' It is important to be clear that the terms "constitutive" and 'regulative" refer to modes of conven- tionality. Since, for Fish, it is convention that makes objects possible, all conventions are, in that sense, constitutive. But conventions do not constitute all objects in the same way, and the terms "constitutive" and "regulative" denote different ways for an object or activity to be conventionally. 6 Stanley Cavell, The Claim of Reason (New York, 1979), p. 123. 7 Stanley Cavell, Must We Mean What We Say?
