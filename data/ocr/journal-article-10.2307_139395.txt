<plain_text><page sequence="1">GAINS AND LOSSES FROM TRADE IN THE SHORT RUN STEPHEN ENKE Cape Town, South Africa ECONOMISTS have never had much influence on legislators or electors regarding the issue of protection. In part this may be because they have seemed to talk about different things. Economists have traditionally urged free trade as a way to reallocate domestic resources more efficiently in the long run. Legislators, concerned with an immediate and adverse effect of cheaper imports on some of their constituents' incomes, have usually reacted as though domestic re- sources were forever immobile among different occupations. But it would be wrong to infer that the economist's case for more open trade does not also apply to such extreme short-run situations.1 Accordingly, to demonstrate that a powerful case can be made for freer trade under extremely short-run conditions, the following analysis assumes that no factor of production can be transferred by its owner to another employ- ment. The resultant gains from trade must then arise because the outside world places different relative values on domestically produced goods than does the home economy. Of course the altered international distribution of the fixed domestic output that results from trade is both a cause and an effect of the increases and decreases in personal incomes that accompany trade. The prices of traded goods will be more drastically altered by increased trade if domestic resources are immobile. So will their owners' incomes. However, even when resources cannot be reallocated, the redistribution of their output through trade provides a gain.2 Current interest once again in regional free trade pacts underlines a distinc- tion between what might be termed enlarged trade-free trade among a subset of countries-and universally freer trade. In the past, following Viner and others, these two distinct cases have been evaluated mostly in terms of "trade creation" and "trade diversion." The present analysis, by suggesting that economic welfare, trade volume, and price changes are all monotonically related, proposes a new form of answer to the old question of what regional lOf course, the now not-so-new welfare economics sought to circumvent the "short- run" difficulty by asserting that more trade is preferable if those who benefit can overcom- pensate those who are injured. By implication, there was nothing wrong with economic theory, and it was left to the politicians to legislate compensation if they were so concerned about losses. However, it will be shown that actual compensation would alter the market outcome of opening trade, and so various policy dilemmas would still remain. (See N. Kaldor, "Welfare Propositions of Economics and Interpersonal Comparisons of Utility," Economic Journal, Sept., 1939, for the original statement of the compensation argument.) 2There are at least three major sources of gain from more external trade. First, and traditionally the most emphasized, is the reallocation of resources to increase national specialization in production. Second, and only explicitly noted in the last decade or so by Haberler and others (see below), is the gain from internationally redistributing a given national output. Third, and perhaps more important but seldom specifically mentioned, is the addition to the national output that depends on imports of producer goods. The size of a nation's production block is itself dependent on trade. This last idea has been developed by the author in an article as yet unpublished. 41 Vol. XXVII, no. 1, Feb., 1961</page><page sequence="2">42 Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science free trade pacts are most beneficial to single member countries. Some general principles of economic integration are also stated. SOME PREVIOUS CONTRIBUTIONS During recent years economists have sought to demonstrate in varying detail the gains arising from trading part of a given domestic output. Three such contributions are briefly commented upon here. All seem to have some inadequacies. Samuelson3 has contrasted the prices and quantities of commodities con- sumed under conditions of more trade and less trade and has attempted to show that the former set is preferable to the latter. His prices are designated by p's and consumed quantities by x's: the free trade case is distinguished by priming them. He asserts that Yp'x' is preferable to Epx. Paraphrasing part of his argument, persons are held to prefer Xp'x' to Ep'x for in fact they do buy x' of each commodity at its p' price and not x. And the economic theory of index numbers tells us that Yp'x is potentially better than 4px because further adjust- ments are possible at p' free trade prices. But this treatment really evades the essential problem. At the new prices, with open trade, many individuals may be prevented from buying the previous mix even though they would prefer it to the new. Some goods may now be more expensive, or some buyers may now earn less income as producers, so that what they do buy after freer trade is no proof of preference.4 Haberler5 illustrated a case in which factor immobilities occasioned a fixed product, at which the marginal rate of output substitution (shown by the slope of the transformation curve at a given point P), was incompatible with external market exchange ratios (shown by a line of different slope cutting the trans- formation curve at P). He indicated that a country, without changing its out- put, could however trade its way at world prices to a preferred consumption mix. Deliberately, he did not include any collective consumer indifference curves in his diagram, on the grounds that consumers' incomes would change and so invalidate them. However, where factors are quite immobile and output quite fixed, the transformation curve is replaced by a point. What then matters is whether or not the external exchange ratio conforms to the internal exchange ratio under conditions of no international trade. In other words, if domestic consumer indifference curves were a valid construct, would the slope of the one passing through the fixed output point P be there parallel with an external exchange line? Normally, except by coincidence, it would not. And so trade is usually beneficial even with a fixed national product. 3P. A. Samuelson, "The Gains from International Trade," this JOURNAL, V, no. 2, May, 1939, 195. His thesis is in general terms and so logically includes the extremely short-run case of immobile resources considered here. Factor pnrces and quantities are ignored in this comment; Samuelson handles them analogously to commodity prices and quantities. 4Professor G. Haberler ("Some Problems in the Pure Theory of International Trade," Economic Journal, June, 1950) also rejects Samuelson's argument, for apparently similar reasons, and terms it anthropomorphic. 51bid.</page><page sequence="3">Trade in the Short Run 43 Lipsey, in a more recent analysis of the effects of establishing a free trade area, has shown that trade diversion to a second cheapest source of supply may still benefit an importing country because of consumption effects.&amp; He assumes that the domestic economy has a fixed output of wheat. Before diversion, clothing was imported over a common tariff from the cheapest source: but, although the economy moved along this most favourable external exchange line, domestic buyers adjusted to the internal price uwth duty. The highest attained consumer indifference curve was hence intersected by the world price line. After this country's inclusion in a customs union, its con- sumers can attain a higher indifference curve if the now lowest duty-free price does not differ from the best world price before duty by more than a defined amount. Lipsey, unlike Haberler, does not bother with a domestic transforma- tion curve but does assume a valid community indifference curve. However, because all his domestic producers specialize in making one good, the conflicts of internal income that are the sugar and spice of trade theory are missing from his welfare pudding. These three stimulating contributions all consider-although Samuelson does so only implicitly-the possible gains from redistributing output internationally while domestic production remains unchanged. However none of them really gets "inside" the domestic economy. The interacting circle of more external trade, new commodity prices, conflicting income changes, and novel individual consumption patterns is not traced. Accordingly, it is impossible to distinguish the incidence of freer or enlarged trade on different producing groups within the country, and certain welfare conclusions can only be stated in rather aggregative terms that evade the political problems of freer trade. BASIC MODEL AND UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS The following simple model will allow us to make several important and perhaps novel welfare inferences. We assume that the local economy makes two goods only, x and y. These are made by households. It is supposed that each set of households (designated X or Y) produces a constant output of either x or y, but not both. A household may own one or more factors of pro- duction, from which it derives a physical output. The essential supposition is that each unit of labour, land, or capital, during the short-run period con- sidered, cannot be transferred to another occupation or owner. The marginal physical product of each factor in each employment accordingly remains un- changed as external trade is restricted or freed. This extreme assumption will exaggerate the effects of new trade policies on the income of both sets of producers. Figure 1 is a box diagram. XA is the domestic output of x, measured from X; YA is the output of y, measured from Y. Initially, to postpone controversy regarding collective indifference curves, we can think of a single producer of x and a single producer of y. Their consumer indifference curves have X and Y 6R. C.

A rotating price line, centred at A and moving from AX to AY, will become tangent to successive consumer indif- ference curves of the x producer. The loci of these tangencies, designated Q$, will be X's offer curve. It shows, with A as origin, how much x he will give for how much y. It also indicates, with X as origin, the consumption of X house- holds at different y prices for x. An analogous curve for Y can be obtained, marked Qs,. The intersection of these two offer-consumption curves7 in the case of this closed economy is at Q, and the equilibrium price is AP". It is evident, to consider a trivial case first, that both X and Y are better off trading with one another exclusively than not trading at all. Thus, self- sufficiency of the X household would place it on an indifference curve passing through A, which must be much lower than X" passing through QX. Under self-sufficiency, each of these two consumers has a very different marginal rate of substitution between x and y than that represented by the line AP". Free domestic trade, as againast household self-sufficiency, does not occasion one uniform set of prices in place of another. It rather equalizes the otherwise different but implicit intra-household prices.8 The entire argument that follows could be developed in general terms, pertaining to households A, B, . . ., N, along the lines indicated in a later section. But policy questions usually concern the incidence of more trade upon 7At Q the consumer indifference curves of Y and X are tangent, and they are both on the contract curve, CC'; the only equilibrium point on this contract curve is Q, because only there is a line from A tangent at the same point to an indifference curve of both X and Y. 5Graphically, if one wishes to suppose that each household produces some x and some y the price would have to revolve around a point inside the box, indicating the quantity of x and y produced by both households. In all cases it is assumed that households ignore their possible influence on price. There is full competition in buying and selling output.</page><page sequence="5">Trade in the Short Run 45 classes of producers within a country, and so it would be convenient if we could construct a collective consumer indifference curve for all X households, and another for all Y households. Fortunately, because each household has a constant physical output, the highest indifference curve that it can attain at each relative price line is determinable. The point of tangency will indicate the amount of x and y it will consume. Addition will give the amount of x and y that all X households (and all Y households) will consume at each price. In this way a collective offer-consumption curve for each class of household is obtained. Each point on such a curve-Q on Q., for instance-is also located on some one collective consumer indifference curve for that class of producing households; and the remainder of this collective indifference curve is ascertainable, if it is used only to show alternative quantities of x and y that would be equally satisfactory if distributed in a particular way.9 In all that follows the various consumer indifference curves of Figure 1 will accordingly be deemed collective, referring to X or Y households. Hence, X households are better off at Q than at A, as are Y households. And at Q they are respectively located on collective indifference curves X" and Y". Because of the assumption that each household has a constant physical out- put, these offer-consumption curves are independent of income changes accom- panying price changes, and they trace a path of increasing welfare away from A for the class of household concerned. This would not necessarily be so if different prices occasioned a reallocation of resources and altered household outputs. So short-run analysis, with fixed factor employments, permits some simple but important statements concerning the welfare effects of more open trade. External Trade with no Compensation External trade with another country means that X and Y households engage in three-way trade with one another and with the outside world. The opening of trade brings a different price between x and y from that represented by AP". We shall suppose that the applicable world price is shown by AP', which means that y has cheapened in terms of x, and so trade involves importing y and exporting x. Clearly, X households are benefited because they can now attain the X' indifference curve at R, and Y households are injured because they are forced back to the Y' indifference curve at S. Is this open situation "better" than the closed one?10 WFor example, Q is on the collective consumer indifference curve X". All the individual consumer indifference curves, 'which when summed at the given price, AP", gave Q, are "known." For each unit change in x it is conceptually possible, for each household, to ascertain the indifferent change in y. These two related and indifferent changes, when aggregated for all X households, provide a point on the collective curve X", away from Q, which can be designated 0. Then an 0 stock of x and y, uniquely distributed, can make the X households as well and no better off than they are at Q. All other distributions will not leave each and every household indifferent. 10The expenditure of duty collections by government is ignored. Perhaps such duties as it does levy against certain countries are prohibitive. Or protection may come from import quotas.</page><page sequence="6">46 Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science The usual criterion is a net "surplus" that is held to exist if: (1) ex post, the benefited class could more than afford to compensate fully the injured class, and (2) ex ante, the potentially injured class could more than afford to bribe the likely beneficiaries to vote against the change in commercial policy."1 The first, or "compensation" test, demonstrates that the closed situation is worse than the open one. The Y households, which would benefit by moving from indifference curve Y' to Y", could only afford to pay compensation in x and y equal in amount to, say, QS or QT: but it is clear that neither of these quantities would be enough to move the X households back to indifference curve X' from X". The "compensation" test in this case only shows indirectly that open trade is "better" than no trade by showing that the latter situation is worse than the former.12 The second, or "bribery" test, does indicate that freer trade is better because indifference curve Y' lies nearer the X origin than does the X' curve throughout their lengths. And in this case the original location of both groups is Q. But it is not clear from this test that, if the alternative were no trade instead of open trade, the X households could bribe the Y households adequately. Neglecting the possibilities of compensation and bribery, the existence of a net surplus is confirmed by the fact that, with freer trade, R and S are on indifference curves, X' and Y', that are both higher than other such curves, the tangencies of which comprise the intervening segment of the contract curve, CC'. Without trade, and given the output of x and y, the economy can do no better than be somewhere on CC'. And voluntary trade, at any price other than that represented by AP", will increase welfare. External Trade with Full Compensation Governments seem to consider free trade a less normative situation than some degree of protection. They are also sensitive to complaints by those injured by commercial policy. Hence a government may contemplate a com- pensation policy, but its implementation will alter the market outcome of more open trade, and this alteration may reduce the net surplus. The object of government might be to give each household exactly enough purchasing power to command the same amounts of x and y with open trade as was obtainable without external trade and without compensation. Perhaps one can assume that compensatory transfers of one or other commodity will not affect their relative prices as established by the world market. Then, if x is the "payment" good, AB (Figure 1) is the quantity that should be taken from X households and given to Y as compensation. This intercept is deter- mined by a line through Q parallel to AP'. The X households should lose BA "lThe first requirement is that of Kaldor ("Welfare Propositions") and Hicks ("Founda- tions of Welfare Economics," Economic Journal, Dec., 1939). The second and additional requirement is that of T. Scitovsky ("A Note on Welfare Propositions in Economics," Review of Economic Studies, Nov., 1941). The extra condition prevents the possibility that, if compensation is not actually paid, each situation may seem preferable to the other. 12There is no assurance that, if trade were opened, the QR units of x and y that the X households could afford to pay would, when added to the position of the Y households at S, raise them again to indifference curve Y". The fact that indifference curve Y' intersects QR at T is immaterial here, for the Y households are not at T but at S in the open situation. Hence the need to employ obverse reasoning.</page><page sequence="7">Trade in the Short Run 47 of x in proportion to their former consumption of y, and Y households should share this gain in x in proportion to their former consumption of x, in order that each household could buy the same mix as before. Such a compensation scheme would alter the market outcomes otherwise to be expected from more open trade. Both the X and Y households would certainly be aware of such a scheme if it were to be implemented. Respectively anticipating AB more or less of x, each class of household would buy and sell so as to maximize sumptuary satisfactions with reference to B, and A would no longer be the initial point in their calculations. The final outcome would involve a different consumption pattern for both sets of households than re- sulted from more open trade without compensation. And the quantity of exports and imports would probably be less even though the world offered the same terms of trade. No government can offset by compensation the con- flicting internal incidence of opening trade and still have the same external outcome. There will be some gains however from trade with full compensation. Although each household could buy exactly the same quantities of x and y as before, under the scheme suggested above there would be some substitution of y for x at world prices. Each household would attain a somewhat higher consumer indifference curve than if there were no trade. Of course exact compensation schemes are hardly feasible. Certainly any scheme that depended upon the former consumption of each household could hardly be administered. So in practice the policy choice may be between no trade or trade with gains and losses. Even in theory, assuming a choice between (1) compensated trade with small gains for everyone, and (2) un- compensated trade with a larger net surplus but losses mixed with gains, there is still a policy dilemma involving interpersonal comparisons.'3 TRADE TERMS, VOLUMES, AND GAINS There are various reasons for supposing that the gains from trade, the volume of trade, and the disparity between external and internal terms of trade are all monotonically related. If so, the ordinal advantage of a nation entering into closer trade relations with this or that foreign country can be assessed roughly from the probable extent of consequent price changes. And, in the special case of fully compensated trade, it can perhaps be shown that there would be less trade volume and reduced gains. Trade Volume and Trade Terms One normally expects that, the more disparate are the external trade terms from those of a closed domestic market, the greater will be the volume of foreign trade should it be free. Of course, there are different ways of measuring 13An important critique of this entire approach has been made by I.M.D. Little (A Critique of Welfare Economics, Oxford, 1957, esp. chap. vI) in which he stresses as an additional test of a "good" change that the redistribution of welfare be "desirable"; also E. J. Mishan ("A Survey of Welfare Economics," Economic Journal, June, 1960) has recently summarized the logical problems inherent in any use of welfare economics.</page><page sequence="8">48 Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science trade volume, but this will generally be true whether imports and exports are valued at closed or open prices. Lower prices on imports, and higher prices on exports, must usually increase their quantities. Trade Volume and Trade Gains The co-variation between trade volume and trade gains is not so simple and obvious. It requires an understanding of the sources of gains from trade. And it depends somewhat on the manner of their measurement. Sources of gains. The superficial source of gain in voluntarily trading com- modities is of course that the external market places a different comparative value on all the intramarginal units traded than do domestic buyers and sellers of imports and exports. Consequently, assuming a single country's trade cannot influence world prices, trade volume and trade gains are likely to vary to- gether. Other things being equal, and assuming a nation would not seek to exploit any monopoly or monopsony power that it might possess, small nations may benefit proportionately more than large ones from foreign trade because it will bring them larger price changes. A more fundamental source of gain from trade when output is fixed is to be found in the changes in demand occasioned by changing prices and in- comes, and in the fact that these conflicting changes do not exactly offset one another. Thus, because x increases and y decreases in price in Figure 1, the outside world provides an opportunity for domestic households to substitute and so obtain a small net gain. Moreover, considering income effects of demand, the X households generally will not choose to increase their consumption in the same quantities as the Y households decrease theirs. Graphically, if one temporarily assumes no influence of price upon demand, the Q, and Q%, curves of Figure 1 would represent only income-induced changes in demand. The gains from uncompensated trade would then arise because X households buy proportionately more of y and less of x as their income rises and these changes are not exactly offset by the Y households buying propor- tionately more of x and less of y as their incomes decrease. Normally, of course, the Q curves of Figure 1 reflect both price and income elasticities. Within the range of income change, the gains from increased trade will be greater if the exported commodity is a "deferred" good to its producers (that is, they buy proportionately less of it at higher incomes) so that the imported commodity is a "preferred" good (that is, they buy proportionately more of it as their incomes increase); gains will also be greater if the competing pro- ducers of the imported commodity consider it a "deferred" good, and the exported commodity a "preferred" good. These conditions might prevail in the short run. But in the long run, the size distribution of the incomes of X and Y households is likely to be sufficiently similar that a commodity that is a preferred good for one set of households will also be such for all other sets. To the extent that income effects are important, and they must exist to some degree, open trade with full compensation will occasion less trade and fewer gains. In the extreme case of no price-induced substitution effects-the con- sumer indifference curves having right-angle corners-a legal opening of trade would cause neither imports nor exports if the Y households were fully com-</page><page sequence="9">Trade in the Short Run 49 pensated for the price changes affecting their incomes. Alternatively, if at given prices all households bought x and y in the same proportions irrespective of income, trade volume and trade gains would be independent of compensa- tion policies. Because realistic cases presumably combine both price and income effects, there is a nasty but necessary choice between general and individual welfare, a lower per capita gain being the cost of preventing individual losses. Reducing the personal dispersion of gain-including some losses-also reduces the mean gain. Measurement of gain. Measurement of the gains from trade must always be conceptual rather than practical because only prices and quantities pertaining to current trade policy are ascertainable. In this spirit of impracticability some suggestions are advanced below. Indirectly they bear on Samuelson's contribu- tion of 1939.14 The customary approach has been to compare open and closed quantities, weighted by either open or closed prices, but it is not clear that in principle these are the proper weights or quantities. The case presented in Figure 1 reveals the problem. At the open price AP', quantities R, for X households, and S, for Y households, have the same market value taken together as the quantities consumed by these same households in the no trade case represented by Q. The explanation is that the same quantity of x and y is produced in both situations and imports equal exports in value. And yet it has been shown that there is indeed a net utility surplus from trade. If closed prices are used as weights, a comparison of closed and open quantities will always show a gain from trade, whether or not there is one. In Figure 1, even if indifference curves X' and Y' were conceivably tangent,'5 valuing the households' possible consumption points R and S at closed prices would indicate that they were jointly better off than they were under the no trade situation. The familiar explanation is that households will adjust to price changes even though no better off in real terms. A new consumption mix resulting from new prices, but valued at old prices, will always have an exaggerated value. A specious "solution" that comes to mind is to weight not actual quantities under open and closed trade situations, but rather the quantities that house- holds would buy, given the prices used as weights, that provide the same real income as that enjoyed with and without trade. For example, assuming free trade, there is some quantity on X' that will give the X households the same real income as at R and which will also be tangent to a line parallel with AP". In Figure 1 this is shown as M. And N on Y' is an analogous quantity for Y households. Unfortunately, especially if X' and Y' indifference curves are almost rectilinear, quantities (M - Q) for X households plus quantities (Q - N) for Y households, both weighted with closed prices, may indicate a loss from trade when in a fundamental sense there is a surplus."' 14Samuelson, "The Gains from International Trade," 195. 15Perhaps because X' and Y' have a coincident segment. '6And if open price weights are used with the quantities on X" and Y" that make these indifference curves tangent to a line parallel with AP', the closed situation will always appear exaggeratedly worse than the open one, even though R and S almost coincide and there be little gain from trade.</page><page sequence="10">50 Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science FIGURE 2: Source and measurement of short-run gains from trade Figure 2, which is an elaboration of part of Figure 1, makes the point. So long as the X and Y households are somewhere on the contract curve CC', and at the same point on it, they can both do no better without external trade. Such a point is H, where indifference curves X* and Yv are tangent, on CC'. But with trade the X households have attained X' and the Y households Y'. The points R and S are off CC' but both X' and Y' are "higher" than X* and Yv respectively. The "overlap" of X' and Y' is in a sense the gain from trade and needs to be measured at least conceptually. This requires a selection of quan- tities and price weights that will always and only indicate a gain when there iS one. The price to be used as a weight might be the price (PP* in Figure 2) at H given by thie tangent X* and Y* curves. In the present case, this will probably entail a lower y price for x than in the open situation, and a higher one than in the closed situation. The quantities that X and Y households would buy at these prices, giving them the same real income as at R and S respectively, are R* and S*. And U (on indifference curve X") and V (on Y") give X and Y households the same real income they would have at Q besides being the amounts they would buy if the PP~ prices prevailed. Using PP* price deter- mined at H, and considering the quantities (R* U) from the X origin plus the quantities (V7- S*) from the Y origin, a surplus from trade will be indicated only when the indifference curves X' and Y' have an "overlap" or AP' is better than AP". Of course this "&lt;ideal" procedure is hardly applicable for even the two commodity case. A more practical and approximate method of comparing the benefits of a country entering into free trade with one or another nation might be to estimate the value of the probable consumption change by taking the difference between present and prospective quantities consumed and weighting them with prices half way between the present and prospective ones. Taking an intermediate price avoids the problems discussed above, and approximates</page><page sequence="11">Trade in the Short Run 51 PP* in Figure 2, which will normally lie somewhere between present and prospective prices.'7 Price disparities and trade gains. It has been asserted that there is likely to be a greater physical volume of trade the more disparate are the external and closed internal terms of trade. And, so long as trade is voluntary, it is not unreasonable to suppose that increased trade volume is associated with in- creased trade gains. This can be expected, using the "ideal" measure of gain suggested above, so long as successive R*'s and S s diverge, in opposite directions away from CC', at prices increasingly disparate from AP". There is no necessity for these two hypothetical quantities to diverge increasingly as prices vary widely from AP", but they must so diverge at prices not too dissimilar from it, and this divergence is the basis of the proposed conceptual measure- ment of gain. So it is probably true, especially if present and prospective prices are not too different, that disparate trade terms, trade volume, and trade gains are all monotonically related. And, if this can be generally assumed, such a co-variation can be significant for commercial policy. It may assist a country in determining which one of several alternative free trade associations is likely to benefit it most. ENLARGED TRADE AND FREER TRADE Any group of people that currently restricts imports-and hence indirectly its exports-has a choice between "enlarged" trade and "freer" trade. Trade can be "enlarged" by trading freely with some other groups but still restricting imports from all the remaining ones. There is then the question of which other groups to include in the enlarged free trade area. Or trade can be made "freer" by an indiscriminate lowering of restrictions on imports from all other groups. The preceding analysis suggests one economic criterion that might be applied in comparing policy alternatives.'8 In formulating a general theory of benefits from enlarged trade, one can imagine groups of people, each of which produces two or more commodities. These groups may be based on race, religion, sex, or almost anything else, but usually on geography. Thus a few households which collectively produced x and y might be considered a group.'9 Groups will be designated A, B, . . . , N. Consider two commodity cases first. In each group, in the absence of trade, there will be an internal price for x in terms of y, designated pa, pJb, . . * pn. Several possible questions arise. Assuming A has a choice, and ignoring all save its selfish interests, with which other group or collection of groups should it trade? 17The paired consumer indifference curves for X and Y lhouseholds, which together comprise the contract curve, must have slopes other than AP" at all points other than Q if there is to be a unique equilibrium without trade. From Q, along CC' towards the Y origin, these tangencies will probably have slopes representative of slightly higher y prices for x. And the X household consumer indifference curve passing through H (see Xv in Figure 2) will have a slope representative of a lower y price for x than that at R on X'. 18Always recognizing that transformation possibilities must also be considered in the real world, which will mean more trade volume, smaller changes in household incomes, and reduced price changes in the long run. 19Initially, although such a supposition is convenient rather than essential, one can assume that a group trades freely or not at all with other groups.</page><page sequence="12">52 Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science If the kind of commodity that A imports and exports is not affected by the decision-for example when pa is lower than all other internal group prices- the best trading arrangement for A is that which will result in the most different price. Thus, if the ordering of all possible resultant prices is p'ad, pacd, P'abod then the preference order for A in trading is with D alone, with C and D, and with B, C, and D. "Enlarged" trade may involve the further merging of already merged groups. Thus, assuming A and D have merged, the question may arise as to whether C should now be included. So far as A + D is concerned as a collectivity,20 this is beneficial, for p'ad, will differ from pad. And it benefits C. But A will suffer and object, because p, is less disparate than pd when both are compared with pa It is not inevitable thbat one or more groups within a freely trading subset must lose from including one or more groups in the set. The factor endowments of the additional groups might be so extreme that their inclusion would still further change prevailing prices for each and every group of the original subset. A more usual expectation though is that at least one group of the original subset will be injured by enlarging trade. A number of generalizations seem warranted regarding the enlargement of trade. First, a solitary group will always benefit from being included in a freely trading suLbset. Second, a freely trading subset will always benefit as a collec- tivity by including another group. Third, a given group would rather trade freely with some one particular group or subset than with any other possible combination of groups. Fourth, a particular group of a subset may not benefit from having another group added to the subset. Fifth, a set of groups will benefit most from all trading freely together, even though there are many groups that would prefer to trade exclusively with some other particular group or subset.21 If groups can negotiate their membership in alternative subsets it is not inconceivable that side payments might be offered as an inducement to a par- ticular group to join a subset that might otherwise be suboptimum from its viewpoint. Frequently the quid pro quo could be political rather than economic. Such possibilities are most likely when political independence is lost because a group joins some subset.22 Commercial policy must of course often choose between trade enlargement and freer trade; the proposed measure of gain can perhaps be validly applied when the choice is between enlarging trade with certain other groups or freeing trade to some extent with all groups. This approach, for a single country, is tantamount to the familiar statement that more trade should always be sought by liberalizing imports from the 201n this case it is necessary to think of the X households of A and D together having an offer-consumption curve, and similarly the Y households of both groups, with a resultant price of Pad; the reasoning of the previous sections indicates that outside trade and accom- panying price changes will benefit one class of households more than the other class is injured. 21A group and a subset are here analytically equivalent. Both contain X and Y households. A subset includes two or more groups. 22Among other things, the group must then worry about further enlargements of trade that will injure it but which it cannot subsequently prevent.</page><page sequence="13">Trade in the Short Run 53 most economical source. Trade diversion has generally been held inferior to trade creation because it fails to meet this requirement. But the most eco- nomical place for country A to obtain imports of y is from that country where y can be obtained most cheaply in terms of the x export. It is the relative prices to A on imports and exports that matter. Country A may obtain better terms of trade exchanging goods solely with B, if B has very expensive x but cheap y and would buy and sell only with A, than by trading freely with the rest of the world. National and global interests are then not in accord.23 Practically, universal free trade hardly seems imminent, but this may not be of great concern so long as regional and imperial free trade blocs include a wide range of productive agents in about the same proportions. More im- mediate problems concern the memberships of customs unions and the like. The most advantageous free trade areas, on economic grounds, are those that include the most economically unlike nations with the most disparate closed prices. However, geographic contiguity is sometimes a constraining condition, and opposition from internal special interests will always be greatest when threatened price changes are largest. And, in any event, free trade unions are usually motivated less by economic than political considerations. SUMMARY The preceding discussion suggests the following conclusions. 1. For a single country there is usually a monotonic relation between trade volume, trade gains, and the disparity between external trade terms and internal exchange ratios with no trade. 2. Compensation of losers will normally alter the outcome of external trade, reduce its volume, and decrease the resultant net surplus, especially where different income elasticities of demand for imports and exports are the main cause of trade. 3. An economy will obtain proportionately more gain from trade, assuming it ignores any monopoly or monopsony power, the less its trade volume influences trade terms. 4. An index number that seeks to measure trade gains should ideally use weights intermediate between closed and open prices, and apply them, not to the quantities which would be consumed with more or less trade, but to quantities which give the same real income in each case and which would be bought if these weights were the prevailing prices. 5. For a given disparity in open and closed terms of trade, uncompensated external trade will yield more gains if, over the relevant ranges of household income, the exported and imported commodities are goods for which the respective households that produce them have low income elasticities of demand. 6. A subset of trading groups will always obtain a net gain from including an additional group, but some of the groups already within the subset may lose. 23Many writers, comparing only the absolute costs of imports, have assumed that each country should favour universal free trade because it can then obtain every good at the cheapest source after allowing for transportation.</page><page sequence="14">54 Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science NO TRADE: VARIOUS PRICES Q~~~~~~ NOOTADE x FIGURE 3: Ordinal utility possibilities 7. An individual trading group will always benefit from external trade, but it may benefit more from trading freely with some limited subset of groups than with the entire set of existing groups. NOTE The portion of the preceding argument that asserted an increase in economic welfare would result from the X and Y households trading externally might be further explained and summarized in Samuelson-Little terms.24 If one imagines a "utility-possibility" function relating X and Y households, the mutually best possibilities in a closed economy are for X and Y always to be on their contract curve. This case is shown by the straight line in Figure 3, where the axes represent ordinal utility, and where it is impossible for either party to be better off without the other being worse off. The only free market possibility in a closed economy, assuming no government transfers, is at Q. This point, as shown in Figure 1, is not only on the contract curve, but the common marginal rates of substitution are such that all supplies will be demanded and no demands will remain unsupplied. Any other price, enforced perhaps by government, will drive X and Y off their contract curve because some supplies will not be demanded and so remain unused. This loss will be greater the more the government price differs from that at Q. This is shown in Figure 3 by the curve below the utility-possibility line. An open economy can use trade, at prices other than at Q, to get off the contract curve but in such a way that the newly attained indifference curves make an "over- lap" when intersecting the former contract curve. The situation represented by R plus S in Figures 1 and 2 is an example. There is then an increase in welfare. The curve above the utility-possibility line in Figure 3 supposedly represents these increasing gains with more disparate external prices. 24Additional references are P. A.
