Pp. vi + 230o. IT is by no wish of the Editor or the reviewer that this notice is so belated. Dr. Ehnmark is a man who adds to wide-reading a soundness of judgment, not always present in mythologists. In this monograph he starts from a whimsy of certain Homeric critics and passes on to a serious study of myth, in which he shows good r eason for rejecting the extreme conclu- sions of certain schools, while retaining the element of truth contained in their theories. In Homer, or for that matter in any author who introduces super-</page><page sequence="2">4o6 Reviews natural beings into his story, the gods perform their wonders in two ways. Sometimes they simply work a miracle, no one knows, and the poet does not say, how; as when Athena or Kalypso sends a favouring wind at the right moment. Sometimes we are told how they did it, at lecast to some extent, as when Apollo does not simply decree that Hektor's body shall take no harm from Achilles' dragging of it, but covers it substantially with an aigis, in other words a stout cloak, which, if it were the property of a man, would be of goatskin, but being the cloak of a great god, is of gold. It is a quaint idea of some separatists, though no more quaint than most of their fancies, that one or the other of these classes of miracles is the more " primitive," the less " rationalistic," and so their difference betrays the work of different poets. This bit of nonsense Dr. Ehnmark makes the text for a very instructive discourse on the two kinds of miracle, which for convenience' sake he calls the pure and the anthropomorphic respectively. He has, of course, no difficulty at all in showing, from a variety of myths taken from different sofirces, that in all manner of grades of culture stories of wonder are told in both ways, by the same tellers among the same people. It is, however, true that to give some details of how the gods acted is characteristic of the epic narrative, that is to say of the places where Homer gives his own account of what happened, not the idea some character in the poem has about it. This is not rational- ism on his part, for he deals too much in wonderful events and beings in whom, we may suppose, he and his audience believed to be called rationalistic. His object is " to represent the gods and their achievements with all the art of which he was capable " (p. 49), and the gods are there, not because Homer thought they would be effective poetical machinery, but because they were part of the nature of things as he and his people understood it (Chap. IV). This leads to the second part of the work (p. 73-end), a discussion of myth in general. That anthropomorphism is rampant in it, and that the quasi-human beings represented often behave quite regardlessly of advanced moral codes are of course familiar facts. Less familiar, perhaps, is the fact that myths are found firmly believed in, sometimes despite logical difficulties which the tellers and bearers of them are perfectly able to see (cf. esp. p. 187). But the chief question discussed is the kind of need which the myths satisfy. Do they simply provide explanations (the aetiological theory, as it may be called) or are they essentially part of a social and ritual pattern, as undoubtedly many of them are? Are they generally popular, in the sense of corresponding to feelings and ideas prevalent at the time and in the place where they originate? All these enquiries have been made before, and the author has examined the answers which have been given, some of them rather paradoxical and extreme. As already indicated, he finds elements of truth in the work of all his predecessors, but is not in complete agreement with any of them. What he insists upon is this. The myth is above all a thing of clear, graphic imagery, which to the mind of the maker and hearer of it shows the subject, generally an important action of a supernatural being, as it was, as it must have been, whether that involves being fully intelligible,</page><page sequence="3">Reviews 407 or a satisfactory explanation of the results of the action, or not. " The myth is . . . not a primitive science. With equal right it can be called poetry. It stands between both and has given impulses to both.... That which separates the mythic explanation from the scientific, unites myth and poetry. Once more the visualization and the concrete conception ... are seen to be the decisive factors; only when this is taken into account does it become comprehensible that the myth can contain so many contradictions and still be believed." (p. 211). It would be easy to make a fairly long list of small points well taken, and another, of much less value, of places where the author has slipped a little in his English idiom ; but space is limited.
