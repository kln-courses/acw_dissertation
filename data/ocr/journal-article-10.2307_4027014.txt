FULLINWIDER'* Recent explorations into Sigmund Freud's intellectual development by Frank Sulloway and Lucille Ritvo have directed attention to the significance of evolutionary theory for psycho- analysis.1 In this paper I shall pursue the exploration by showing how Darwin was received by members of the so-called Helmholtz circle (Hermann von Helmholtz, Emil du Bois- Reymond, Ernst Brucke) and certain of Freud's teachers in the University of Vienna medical school. I will make the point that the Leibniz-Kant background of these several scientists was important for this reception. I will argue that the Leibniz-Kant tradition came forward to Freud by two roads, Helmholtz's unconscious inference as foundation for a physiology of the senses, and Arthur Schopenhauer's not unrelated uses of the principle of sufficient reason to explain the possibility of lawlikeness in a universe of lawless energies. Finally, I will suggest ways in which Freud received and used the tradition. Freud's colleague Sigmund Exner used what he considered to be Darwin's theories both to aid in creating a synthesis of the two Leibniz-Kant trends and to save their Kantian elements for science. In so doing he fleshed out an alternative brain model to the one Freud used in his 1895 'Project for a Scientific Psychology'. Arguably, Freud made increased use of the alternative brain model in his later writings, and in so doing fell back in significant ways upon the Leibniz-Kant tradition. 1 Johannes Muller (1801-58) physiologist and anatomist at the University of Berlin was not only a leading light in the physiology of his day, he was the master under whom Brucke, du Bois-Reymond and Helmholtz learned their physiology. It is with their rebellion against his vitalism that historians often begin their studies of Freud's education.2 It is sometimes overlooked that their rebellion took place within the context of the physiology of the senses * Department of History, Arizona State University, Tempe, AZ 85281, USA. 1 Frank Sulloway, Freud, Biologist of the Mind: Beyond the Psychoanalytic Legend, London, 1979, pp. 238-76, 361-92; Lucille Ritvo, 'Carl Claus as Freud's Professor of the New Darwinian Biology', International Journal of Psychoanalysis, (1972), 53, pp. 277-83, and 'The impact of Darwin on Freud', Psychoanalytic Quarterly, (1974), 43, pp. 177-92,; Darwin's Influence on Freud, New Haven, 1990. 2 See, e.g., Ernest Jones, Sigmund Freud: Life and Work, Vol. I, The Young Freud, 1856-1900, London, 1953, pp. 45ff; Sigfried Bernfeld, 'Freud's earliest theories and the School of Helmholtz', Psychoanalytic Quarterly, (1944), 13, pp. 341-62; Paul Cranefield, 'Freud and the "School of Helmholtz"', Gesnerus, (1966), 23, pp. 35-9; Peter Amacher, Freud's Neurological Education and its Influence on Psychoanalytic Theory, Vol. IV, Psychological Issues, New York, 1964-65.</page><page sequence="2">22 S. P. Fullinwider that grew out of the Leibniz-Kant tradition. The physiology of the senses they developed from mid-century onwards was largely structured by their response to that tradition. Muller advanced the proposition that became controlling: sensation is an attribute not of some real object in the outer world but of the sensory nerves: Sensation, therefore, consists in the communication to the sensorium, not of the quality or state of the external body, but of the condition of the nerves themselves, excited by the external causes. We do not feel the knife which gives us pain, but the painful state of our nerves produced by it.3 He was one with the Scot David Hume as to the subjectivity of our representations, but he did not adopt the British naive realism (that Nietzsche was to call the dogma of immaculate perception) which held that the sensory nerves are neutral conductors. Muller's critique of the neutral conductor theory was straightforward. He pointed out that all sensory nerves transmit certain sensory impressions, for example such impression as might be given by electrical stimulation. But often the qualitative results differ depending upon the nerve stimulated. To the nerves of sight the electrical stimulus might manifest itself as a flash of light; not so to the nerves of touch. Again, some sensory nerves transmit the sun's radiation as light, others as heat. And yet again, some sensory nerves will transmit sound, or etc., some will not. From these facts of everyday life Muller concluded that the sensory quality experienced is specific to the nerve stimulated. He spoke of 'specific nerve energies': '...each peculiar nerve of sense has special powers or qualities which the exciting causes merely render manifest'.' Thus, sounds, colours, light itself, are not merely subjective, they are innate. Though influenced by Kant, Muller tended at times to push back to Leibniz. In asserting that each species is innately endowed with a unique 'organizing principle' or 'ruling idea' and in rejecting Kant's transcendental forms ('I do not adopt the opinion that the mind is originally occupied by the primitive ideas of Kant, or the categories of Aristotle; these appear to be the fruit of experience and of the power of abstraction.')5 he was close to advocating a Leibnizian-like pre-established harmony between the experienced world of subjective sensations and events in the 'outer world' which the subjective sensations are thought somehow to accompany. Muller's notion of a ruling idea (which, though he used it in the context of fixed biological species, in some ways anticipated today's notions about genetic programming)6 carried within it a principle destined to shape the German response to Darwin, the principle that it is the unconscious formative action of such a ruling idea that structures man's relation to his world: A piece of mechanism is formed in accordance with the idea held by the artificer, this idea being the purpose for which it was intended. An 'idea' also regulates the structure of every organism, and each of its component organs. In the former case, however, the ruling idea exists external to the artificial mechanism, namely, in the mind of the artificer; while the idea, which is the cause of harmony of organic bodies, is in action in the organism itself, exerting in it a formative power unconsciously, and in obedience to determinate laws.7 Muller suggested the action of a 'vital principle' here, by which he meant the operation 3 Johannes Muller, Elements of Physiology, Vol. I, 2nd edn (tr. William Baly), London, 1840, p. 819. 4 Ibid. 5 Ibid., II, p. 1348. 6 Ibid., II, p. 1334. 7 Ibid., II, p. 1333.</page><page sequence="3">Darwin faces Kant 23 of the organizing principle or ruling idea: he defined the vital principle as the fact that an organizing idea is at work in the organism.8 The friends - du Bois-Reymond, Brucke and Helmholtz - who early-on joined hands in opposition to Muller's vital principle or, as they called it, 'life force', set themselves the group goal of creating a physiology defined by the laws of physics and chemistry.9 By the German reading, an important part of David Hume's 1730-40 critique of rationalism turned on the notion that since our ideas (the German Vorstellungen or representations) are subjective and learned, so must be the connections between them. Since those connections are not known a priori they lack the element of necessity. Muller agreed whole-heartedly. He added, however, that an animal might be expected to learn that certain events follow upon certain others but that it could never develop the abstract notion of necessary cause. Thus in his view the human mind has a unique power inexplicable by the laws of physics and chemistry. He turned to the organizing principle notion to explain why man alone has the power of abstracting and generalizing from his experience.10 Muller's students set about confronting his legacy: because of the subjectivity of specific nerve energies they had to find an explanation for the apparent harmony between that subjectivity and the world it represents, yet they were sworn to work within the context of their reductionism. How do the laws of physics and chemistry make possible the sensory events that give us a working picture of the world? Du Bois-Reymond, the most dogmatically reductionist of the friends, liked to point out that when taken within the context of Helmholtz's 1847 classic, Ueber die Erhaltung der Kraft (On the Conservation of Force), the notion of pre-established harmony, which du Bois-Reymond saw coming down from Leibniz and Kant, as their solution to the riddle, involves an impossible miracle in that it requires (divine) creative act[s] contrary to the Erhaltung's showing that creating something out of nothing is impossible. Du Bois- Reymond implicated both the Leibniz version which featured the principle of sufficient reason and 'the inborn Kantian categories'. Yet having himself adopted Muller's notion of specific nerve energies he had little choice but to recognize a subject-object harmony of some sort. From this unenviable position du Bois-Reymond issued his famous lament that neither the human mind nor what he called the Laplacian Geist (i.e. Laplace's demon) are capable of solving the riddle of harmony." Du Bois-Reymond, who was instrumental in getting Helmholtz's Erhaltung published in the first place, saw that work as a final nail in the coffin of the miraculous 'vital principle' because that principle imagines a (vital) force spontaneously springing out of nothing at the organism's birth and just as spontaneously passing back into nothing at the organism's demise.'2 It is possible that in his enthusiasm for the Erhaltung he overlooked the 8 Ibid., II, p. 1334. 9 See, e.g., Charles Culotta, 'German biophysics, objective knowledge, and romanticism', Hist.

P. Fullinwider significance of the fact that in it Helmholtz enshrined Leibniz's non-Cartesian definition of force (F = MV2). Helmholtz had situated himself on the Leibnizian side of the historic debate over the true definition of force.13 Leibniz argued in 1686 and thereafter that the Cartesian definition of force as F = MV (mass times velocity) was merely the correlate of Descartes's reduction of the world to mere extension, figure, and motion. The specific problem he found with the F = MV formulation was that it did not describe the force attained by a falling body; it left gravity out of the world. When we consider that it is gravity that pulls the pendulum down we are permitted to visualize the pendulum as acquiring within it the force necessary to carry it back up again against gravity's pull. The force that it has acquired in its downward swing is what Leibniz called vis viva (F = MV2). The point is that vis viva (living force) can be visualized as a substantial thing within the object as opposed to a force exerted on the object from outside. It anticipates the notion of energy. Such a force can be seen as both cause and substance. As substance it is conserved, meaning that nothing can be lost between cause and effect. 'It is enough', he wrote in 1690, 'if I am conceded that which is a fact in my opinion, namely, that what I call force is conserved and not that which others have called by that name. Because nature would not otherwise observe the law of equality between effect and cause...'. 14 In short, we are brought to the assertion of necessary cause. Necessary cause, a notion drawn from logic, was thereby tied to activity in the phenomenal realm: metaphysics was linked to physics. Leibniz believed that were it true that extension, figure and motion alone describe reality we would be left with a world that is merely random and less than real. MV2, he believed, speaks to us of a latent or potential force (vis mortua) which transforms itself into an active one (vis viva), thus in a vaguely Aristotelian sense when responding to forces an object is obeying its own form or idea (Leibniz's 'substantial form'). The force transformation from latent to vis viva comes from within. Every object follows its own idea or nature, but this is done in harmony (thus in relation) with all other objects. This is what Leibniz meant by the principle of sufficient reason (Satz des zureichenden Grund). The principle of sufficient reason met with the MV2 definition of force in Leibniz's notion of substantial form. As the substance of reality substantial form (as opposed to the Cartesian inactive 'matter') was 13 The vis viva controversy, pitting followers of Leibniz against the Newtonians and Cartesians, has been addressed by a number of historians in the recent past. Thomas Hankins, 'Eighteenth century attempts to resolve the vis viva controversy', Isis, (1965), 56, pp. 281-97, holds that Leibniz wanted a conservation principle to keep the world from 'winding down'; Wilson Scott, The Conflict between Atomism and Conservation Theory, 1644-1860, London, 1970, p. 25, sees the controversy as part of the larger 'hard body' atom debate; Erwin Hiebert, Historical Roots of the Principle of the Conversation of Energy, Madison, 1962, traces the notion of energy back to Leibniz's vis viva; but Yehuda Elkana, The Discovery of the Conversation of Energy, London, 1974, p. 27, disagrees, seeing vis viva as fore-runner of Naturphilosophie's concept of force, this in spite of Helmholtz's express use of the vis viv4 F = MV2; Richard Westfall, Force in Newton's Physics: The Science of Dynamics in the Seventeenth Century, London, 1971, p. 322, sees Leibniz's vis viva as the breakthrough into dynamics but argues that Leibniz was never able to free himself from the impact of theory of force. It was Gerd Buchdahl, Metaphysics and the Philosophy of Science: The Classical Origins, Descartes to Kant, Oxford, 1969, pp. 417ff, who expanded the inquiry into an exploration of the relationship between Leibniz's physics and metaphysics. 14 Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz, Discourse on Metaphysics (tr.

(13), discussion of Leibniz's use of F = MV2 and the principle of sufficient reason.</page><page sequence="5">Darwin faces Kant 25 to be seen as dynamic, an entelechy, unfolding its predicates from its subject. This process of unfolding presumably obeys the principle of sufficient reason (God chooses the best of the possible) in the realm of real substance, and obeying the constraints of MV2 in the realm of observable phenomena.15 Devoted as he was to the reductionist programme, du Bois-Reymond nevertheless could not blind himself to the fact of organization. He could do no better than to make its presence in the world one of his insoluble world riddles. By adopting F = MV2 Helmholtz served notice of his intention to halt his reductionism somewhere short of the world-randomness du Bois-Reymond believed it necessary to confront. In the Erhaltung Helmholtz defined the principle of sufficient reason as ' comprehensibility' (Begrieflichkeit). He then added a statement not calculated to enhance du Bois-Reymond's easy repose: comprehending nature, he said, is the goal of science.16 Helmholtz went further. He said that science's goal would be achieved when all proximate causes are traced back to 'ultimate invariable causes of natural phenomena'. When, that is, all natural processes are traced back to 'such causes, in which nature is completely comprehensible' we will know that all changes lie inside the 'law of causal necessity'.17 He was in effect announcing his intent to find a way of equating the principle of sufficient reason with necessary cause. In this he was prepared to go further than Leibniz, for whom necessity was inextricably bound with analytic logic (the principle of contradiction). In seeking a less than heavenly source for the application of logical necessity to the world beyond one's subjectivity, Helmholtz decided to look at how events present themselves to the human cognition system. He thought he found the answer in the formulation: 'like effects imply like causes'. The next step was to formulate a theory of the unconscious inference of lawlikeness. Developing such a theory took Helmholtz into path-breaking studies of optics and hearing, e.g. Handbook of Physiological Optics (1856-66) and The Theory of the Sensation of Tone as Foundation for the Theory of Music (1863). Muller's theory of specific nerve energies provided his point of departure. He argued, for example, that the colour red is not just a physiological event, it is a logical event also, in that it is a sign of its cause operating from the outside (trans-subjective) world. But where a single sign merely indicates the existence of something beyond itself, like signs do more. In a talk of 1868 he said that they give us an 'image' of lawlikeness: The nerve excitations in our brain and the ideas in our consciousness can be images of the processes of the outer world, in so far as the former through their time sequence copy the time sequence of the latter, [or] in so far as they describe likeness of the objects through likeness of signs, and thus also lawful order through lawful order."8 15 Leibniz, op. cit.

P. Fullinwider In a talk of 1878, 'The Facts in Perception', he summarized and expanded upon the epistemology outlined in the earlier Handbook of Optics. He said that in the way just described signs 'can form an image of the law of this thing which is happening'. He pictured the process by which the human cognitive system comes to experience lawlikeness in the following way: because of the physiological fact of specific nerve energies a particular sensation that a nerve renders functions not as a mirror image but as a sign of that which stimulated the nerve. The likeness of two or more signs gives us an 'image', an image not of some thing in the world out there but of its lawlikeness. The lawlikeness is experienced at first as 'substantiality'. The cognitive system to this point has registered a 'relationship which remains alike between altering magnitudes'. This relationship is expressed as the experience of an enduring object beyond our subjectivity. Thus the 'object' is lawlikeness: 'What we perceive directly is only this law.' Up to this point experience is still private; it has not achieved the dimension of intersubjectivity, the dimension Kant attributed to the operation of the category necessary cause.'9 In the 1868 talk cited above, Helmholtz described two ways of achieving intersubjectivity, the first through measurement,20 the second through what he called the 'unconscious inference'. He introduced the notion of the unconscious inference in his 1863 work on sound to explain the appearance of the mind-body harmony he discovered in the ear's reception of musical melody. In a talk of 1892 ('Goethe's Anticipation of Subsequent Scientific Ideas') he further developed the arguments he had made in 1863 and in various places and times since (e.g. the 1878 'Facts in Perception'), at the same time taking the opportunity to make amends for an earlier attack on the poet (1853, 'The Scientific Researches of Goethe'). Helmholtz had long liked to speak of the 'actual' world and to say that it consists of energy transformations.21 The conservation of energy, he said, presumes that all these energy transformations are without exception completely lawful. When we become aware of them, he explained in 1892, it is because they have come to us as sensory events. But we are not at the outset conscious of their lawlikeness because the regular, the enduring, is clothed in the particular, the accidental. Unless it clothes the lawlike the particular will spark momentary consciousness and be forgotten.22 As sign the Helmholtzian sensation pointed to its cause. As image it went beyond that, It implied that the cause it pointed to was (logically) necessary: like effects (or sensations) implying like causes or lawlikeness. For the moment, though one has already become aware of substantiality, the logical inference of lawlikeness will remain unconscious. der letztern nachahmen, insofern sie Gleichheit der Zeichen, under daher auch gesetzliche Ordnung durch gesetzliche Ordnung darstellen'. 19 Hermann von Helmholtz, 'The facts in perception' (1878), in Hermann von Helmholtz: Epistemological Writings (ed.

The artist becomes aware of the lawlikeness as it appears before him on his canvas. It is the inspiration of harmony and universality, which if it finds its way into the painting will have brought the lawlikeness into the public (intersubjective) realm and at the same time will have been made public by the projection of lawlikeness. Helmholtz was striving to achieve a union between Newton and Goethe, Enlightenment mechanism and Romantic form. But the inner thrust of Helmholtz's theorizing was deliberately Kantian. In 1881 he admitted to the strong Kantian influence on his 1847 Erhaltung.23 Two years before his death he said that 'physiological investigations of the sense organs and of their activities have at last produced results which agree in essential points ... with Kant '.24 Helmholtz had consciously tried to capture in physiological events that which was valid in Kant's notions of a priori forms imposed upon experience by the cognitive constitution. Leibniz had long before suggested the principle of sufficient reason as a principle of selection. Out of the infinitude of logical possibilities God selects only those that will make for an orderly world. Leibniz characterized the world of mere possibility (which is prior to the selection process) as one of randomness; sufficient reason brings organization. Helmholtz's sensory physiology achieved much the same result. Those sensory events that occur randomly are forgotten, those that symbolize order remain in memory to become the basis for the unconscious inference. We begin with the randomly mechanistic and end with organized form. For Muller matter in motion without more could not explain life forms. For Helmholtz it could not without more explain the world of our experience. For du Bois-Reymond we have no license to entertain any other principle than matter in motion. He then gained fame by denying the possibility of ever explaining organization. When he was twenty-four du Bois-Reymond wrote to a friend that 'Brucke and I have sworn to advance the truth that no other force is acting in the organism than the merely physical-chemical.'25 He had not changed his mind in 1848 when he brought out his Investigations of Animal Electricity and devoted the introduction to an attack on vitalism. Nor had he changed his mind twenty-four years later when he announced that physiology consists in the 'analysis of the processes of nature into the mechanics of the atom '.26 But his was a dogmatism rooted in humility. Ever hostile towards Kant he refused always the use of the term 'things in themselves' preferring instead 'things as they are'. But it came out the same: things as they are are unknowable. Du Bois-Reymond was a Kantian despite himself. And he was a hesitant mechanist at best. In his 1848 introduction he wrote that 'matter' and 'force' are abstractions. It is absurd, he said, to think of force as pushing matter into motion, 'matter is not a wagon with force as horses .... '27 Du Bois-Reymond believed that scientists, as such, are limited to dealing with matter in motion. Scientists can aspire only to the 'astronomical knowledge' he ascribed to the Laplacian Geist. The fact that such knowledge is forever beyond our grasp was not the source of du Bois-Reymond's humility 23 Helmholtz, op. cit. (16), p. 49. 24 Helmholtz, op. cit.

Fullinwider before nature. In his famous 1872 'On the Limits of the Knowledge of Nature' he shocked the scientific world by denying the Laplacian Geist access to things as they are.28 Du Bois-Reymond contended that so long as science is satisfied with prediction the fiction of matter in motion is a supremely workable one. In so far as we insist upon questioning our basic premises we fall foul of logic. For instance, following Helmholtz and Kant we must adopt the central forces theory of matter (there exist forces of attraction and repulsion between material points), but logic baulks at the notion of action at a distance. Yet unless we adopt the central forces theory we have no explanation for the atom's impenetrability nor of the fact that it has effects.29 Thus, as du Bois-Reymond believed, the Laplacian world differential equation requires that we adopt an incomprehensible fiction. What hope is there in our crossing the divide separating us from 'things as they are'? None, he answered. 'Ignorabimus' was his plaintive cry. To make matters even worse, du Bois-Reymond argued that neither we nor the Laplacian Geist are in the position of ever solving the problem of consciousness. 'Astronomical knowledge', which he limited to the fiction of matter in motion, will some day describe the brain. But the lesson of the Erhaltung is that motion can cause only motion, that mechanical cause is limited to mechanical effect. If, he said, we follow Leibniz and believe we are dealing with two substances - conscious mind and unconscious matter - we have no explanation other than his miraculous one as to how the two find themselves in harmony. Here again the Erhaltung sets absolute limits.30 From time to time du Bois-Reymond turned to Darwin in hopes of finding in natural selection some surcease from nature's forbidding riddles. Along with Helmholtz and Briicke, he had discovered Darwin's natural selection at an early date. By 1869 Helmholtz was hailing Darwin as a major ally in the fight against vitalism: the 'transmission of individual characteristics from parents to offspring' as evidenced in animal breeding revealed to Helmholtz a law of nature according to which 'adaptation in the structure of organisms' takes place 'blindly' without the intervention of intelligence.31 In 1883, calling Darwin the 'Copernicus of the organic world', du Bois-Reymond agreed with his friend: because of Darwin we can now talk about the stages of organic evolution in terms of 'moving matter' (bewegte Materie); natural selection gives us a new kind of mechanics with which to deal with organic appropriateness.32 But du Bois-Reymond's deep scepticism stepped in to weaken his confidence. Addressing the riddle of organic nature's seeming pre-arranged harmony with the inorganic world and the inability of the Laplacian ' astronomical knowledge' to deal with that harmony, du Bois-Reymond turned to his own hope that the theory of natural selection had introduced a 'new kind of mechanics' with the power to settle the issue and suggested that we adopt the hope as a drowning man might grab a plank.33 But du Bois-Reymond saw the possibility of even further uses for natural selection.

Specifically, the ability through use of the unconscious inference to complete the melodic effect of a musical composition where certain overtones are missing would be seen as inborn but only latent in the nervous system until a certain maturation has taken place.34 Thus, by turning to Darwin, du Bois-Reymond was able, at least between bouts of scepticism, to bring himself to adopt Helmholtz's means of carrying forward the Leibniz-Kant tradition, the notion of the unconscious inference. If it can be said that he and Helmholtz merely toyed with natural selection in their ruminations about its relevance for their science it should not be thought that they did not take Darwin seriously. Nor should the fact that they tended to take Darwin in a Lamarckian way distract us. This was, after all, the way Darwin was taken by those who followed in their footsteps, men like Sigmund Exner and Sigmund Freud.35 The difference between the generation of Helmholtz and the generation of Exner and Freud in the way they approached Darwin was not one of esteem but a reflection of the fact that the ideas of Helmholtz's generation were formed before the 1859 publication of the Origin of Species. Exner's and Freud's ideas were importantly formed by the notions set forth in that book. We have seen that du Bois-Reymond suggested natural selection as a way of mediating between 'nativism' (the Kant tradition) and empiricism. His lifelong friend Ernest Wilhelm von Brucke took up the task of making that mediation effective. 2 Brucke passed most of his professional life at the University of Vienna, a significant part of it devoted to exploring what he called the Young-Helmholtz theory of colour and what he considered its consequences for the science of physiology. He described the Young-Helmholtz theory of colour in the following way. Until the turn-of-the-century advent of Thomas Young's theory it was generally believed both that the nuances of colour are caused by interference between rays of three fundamental colours and that the eye has receptors for every nuance between red and violet. Young argued that, on the contrary, the eye has receptors that show three colour qualities only: red, green and violet. He held that the mixing of colours is done physiologically. If, for example, the left eye is exposed to red and the right to green the person will 'see' gold. This fact can not be explained by the interference theory because no interference has occurred, nor have any 34 du Bois-Reymond, op. cit. (11), pp. 40-2. 35 See Sulloway, op. cit.

P. Fullinwider 'gold receptors' been involved. The Young-Helmholtz theory,36 at least as Brucke interpreted it, held that the red rays excited red and green receptors in the left eye rendering a gold dominated by red, that the green rays excited green and red receptors in the right eye rendering a gold dominated by green, so that the brain's unconscious processes pulled the alike from each side, yielding pure gold.37 Brucke considered this pure gold a deception. He had spent hours in his laboratory working on the illusions of the senses, asking himself, for example, why parallel lines at times appear to diverge and why at times lines of equal length seem unequal.38 He learned to describe these sensory deceptions as unconscious processes, in fact the unconscious inferences of Helmholtz. But Brucke carried this line of reasoning much further than did his friend. In Brucke's hands the perception of colour and sound turned out to be the results of the same processes that generated the illusions he had discovered. In a sense they were illusions also. As with Helmholtz and du Bois-Reymond, Brucke's starting point was Muller's specific nerve energies, somewhat altered. Defining sight as the 'coming to consciousness [Zumbewusstsein] of the condition of excitation of the N[ervus] opticus', he noted that all optical nerve conditions of sensation, whether the pressure of one's finger on the sclera, a sudden cough in the darkness, or perhaps an electrical shock delivered to the retina, come to consciousness as light. He noted further that should the stimulus originate from the 'central organ' because of fever or mental illness the result is called an hallucination. Brucke described experiments of his own and of Helmholtz wherein colours were made to seem other than they were, and experiments in which the same degree of brightness was at different times judged bright and dark. He pointed out deceptions involving judgments of time and space and motion. In his hands the distinction between valid and invalid perception dissolved. Valid or invalid, the experienced sensation was to be seen as a construct of the cognitive constitution. 'The brain', he wrote in an anticipation of Gestalt psychology, 'undertakes to complete the inadequacy of the immediate sense perception 39 Brucke appropriated Helmholtz's unconscious inference to explain his results. But he broadened and also adulterated the theory. In Helmholtz's hands the unconscious inference involved the projection of a very real lawlikeness. Brucke broadened it to the projection of all the details of perception, for example to the perception of gold. Helmholtz's unconscious inference turned on the logic that like effects imply like causes. Brucke altered the logic to the identification and abstracting-out of alikeness; in short to the process of generalization. Thus the 'N. opticus' separates out the gold response in the left eye of the above example, adds that to the gold responses in the right eye. The gold alikeness dominates and in so doing inhibits the red and the green, and because of the domination and the inhibition the gold rises to consciousness. 36 Paul Sherman, Colour Vision in the Nineteenth Century: The Young-Helmholtz-Maxwell Theory, Bristol, 1981, p. 90, holds that Helmholtz's rejection of the equivalence of mixing light with mixing colours was a revolution in the area of colour theory on a par with the rejection of the fixed earth theory in astronomy. Sherman, who points out that Helmholtz found five fundamental colours, does not discuss Helmholtz's physiological theory regarding colour reception. 37 Ernst Brucke, Vorlesungen ueber Physiologie, Vol. II, Vienna, 1885, pp. 167-71. 38 Ibid., p. 156. 39 Ibid., pp. 155-6, 224.

We build our own worlds, but we do it unconsciously: 'We draw unconscious inferences from all our possible impressions and the whole world of our representations organizes itself out of such inferences.'40 And as Brucke drew sensory impressions into the domain of the unconscious inference he blurred the distinction Helmholtz had made between the (private) experience of substantiality and the (public) experience of lawlikeness in the form of harmony and wholeness. Helmholtz had transformed Kant's category of causality from a transcendental form of the understanding into a physiological process by which the world's real lawlikeness reveals itself through the unconscious inference. In Brucke's hands the unconscious inference became a series of self-deceptions that together form the totality of an individual's experience and that at the same time lost the ingredient of necessity (necessary cause) which to Kant and Helmholtz had made for trans-subjective or public experience. It was left to Sigmund Exner to attempt to rescue experience from the idiosyncratic and get it safely back into the public domain. How is it that two people share the same experience of a thing in roughly the same way? We are brought back to the problem Leibniz tried to solve with his notion of pre-established harmony. Exner turned to Darwin. In 1891 Sigmund Exner von Ewarten (1846-1926) succeeded Ernst Brucke as the University of Vienna's professor of physiology, the station in life that represented Sigmund Freud's loftiest dreams. Exner had risen under Brucke's sheltering wing. Brucke sent him as an undergraduate to study under Helmholtz. After graduation Brucke made him a lecturer and an assistant in his laboratory. Exner followed Brucke (and Helmholtz) in making the physiology of the senses his specialty. In quick succession he wrote treatises on the regeneration of the retina, the effects of excitation on the optic nerves, the influence of fatigue on the retina, and finally in 1891 a study of faceted eyes. Meanwhile he became a master of the subject of cerebral localization, an area opened in 1869 by Hitzig and Fritsch in Berlin. In 1879 he wrote a classic chapter on the subject of Ludimar Hermann's Handbuch der Physiologie, and followed in 1891 with a treatise, Untersuchungen ueber die Localisation der Functionen in der Grosshirnrinde des Menschen. This interest and expertise brought him into the sphere of the University's world-renowned psychiatrist and brain-anatomist Theodor Meynert. In attaching himself to Brucke and Meynert he made the same career choices as Freud. Besides working side by side with Exner in Bruicke's laboratory, Freud took three university courses from Exner. In 1894 Exner published his major theoretical work, Outline to a Physiological Explanation of Psychical Phenomena. A year later Freud wrote but did not publish his 'Project for a Scientific Psychology'. Exner's work has been forgotten by history; Freud's has become famous. Both works set out to do the same thing, and it has not gone unnoticed that the two share many assumptions and many conclusions.4' In effect Exner's Outline was an attempt to complete Brucke's work on the physiology of the senses. He built on Muller's specific nerve energy theory and on Helmholtz's 40 Ibid., p. 226. 'Wir gehen eben unbewusste Schlusse aus allen Sinneseindrucken, aus welchen sie gezogen werden konnen, and die ganz Welt unserer Vorstellungen setz sich aus solchen Schlussen zusammen.' 41 Amacher, op. cit. (2).</page><page sequence="12">32 S. P. Fullinwider unconscious inference theory, both as modified by Brucke. And he used Darwin to solve the problem we have seen set forth by du Bois-Reymond, that of pre-established harmony. In his notion of primary and secondary sensations Exner thought he had discovered the key to the workings of the unconscious inference. As he described it, the primary sensation is the sensation while it is still unconscious. The sensory nerve, he said, ends in a subcortical ganglion; it is there, at a point short of the 'organ of consciousness', that the primary sensation finds its unconscious expression. The unconscious process that generates the experienced (or 'secondary') sensation takes place between the subcortical centre and that organ of consciousness, the cortex. Exner took his secondary sensation to be an unconscious inference, but followed Brucke in his description of the logic involved. In the unconscious inference the alike aspects of the primary sensations are recognized and made manifest as secondary sensations. This is done by the physiological processes of facilitation of the alike and inhibition of the disparate. The facilitation follows from the addition of the alike excitations. The inhibition is then the negative of that same process. Exner called the primary sensations premises of the logical inferences. He called this process analytic logic, a logic in which the conclusion is embodied in the premise.42 Exner's description of the unconscious inference of space followed Brucke's and left no doubt that it was to be considered a learned response. Brucke found from stereoscopic evidence that under normal conditions each eye records a flat image. Here the process of abstracting out alikeness would not account for the experience of depth and distance we have when both eyes are trained on an object, so Brucke, following Helmholtz, turned for help to the shifting tensions of the eye muscles.43 In so doing both men skated on thin ice over empiricist waters. But the long arm of Kant reached out across the years and pulled their disciple Exner back to safety. The unconscious inference is learned, but he found the tendency to make that inference to be innate. It is innate because it is a transmitted characteristic acquired in the struggle for existence. Perhaps unwittingly, Exner grabbed the plank du Bois-Reymond said might save a drowning man. As two instances of the working of the transmission of acquired characteristics Exner pointed to the disposition to form connections between certain ideas and certain feelings. Fear of wild animals was an example he liked. He pointed also to the disposition to infer a relation of necessity between cause and effect (particularly when wild animals are about) or, as he put it, the 'firmness' (Festigkeit) of the association between change and changer. That firmness, he argued, can not have been grounded in the experience of the individual.44 Referring to that which has been found to be useful in the struggle for existence he said: I see no obstacle against the assumption that the association between the sensation of change and its cause rests on essentially the same conditions. It is thus understandable that the described relationships of cortical paths in the animal kingdom which have proven useful going back to the struggle for existence pass over into inherited cortical nervous system structure.45 42 Sigmund Exner, Entwurf zu einer physiologischen Erklarung der psychischen Erscheinungen, Vienna, 1894, p. 322. 43 Brucke, op. cit.

It remains to show that the Kantian tradition in its turn shaped Darwinian evolution as it was received by German physiology and to indicate where this process may have influenced Sigmund Freud. Kant held that each person's experience is structured by his cognitive constitution. He held that the cognitive constitution imposes the intuitions of time and space and the categories of the understanding, most centrally necessary cause, to make experience possible. Natural selection imposed something like the following difficulty for Kant's successors: if the world as we experience it is shaped by the cognitive constitution is it this experienced world that is the selecting agent ? This is the issue of conflation raised in its biological form. Is the lawlikeness envisioned by evolutionary theory the same as that imposed by the cognitive constitution to make experience possible? A second strand of the Kantian tradition, originating with Arthur Schopenhauer, supplied the answer. In On the Fourfold Roots of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (1813), and again in The World as Will and Idea (1819), Schopenhauer argued that Kant's transcendental category of necessary cause, placed where it belongs in the sensibility, embodies the principle of sufficient reason..48 Leibniz believed the hand of God guided by the principle of sufficient reason was the selecting agency. Pre-established harmony kept the individual's representations in correspondence with the external events thus selected. Kant's subsequent location of sufficient reason in the transcendental category of necessary cause again raised the problem that du Bois-Reymond called the miracle of pre-established harmony but which is better defined as the question of conflation: is transcendental lawlikeness conflated with the lawlikeness science presupposes in nature ?49 Schopenhauer restructured 46 Ibid., p. 370. 47 Ibid., p. 347; he cited Darwin, Herbert Spencer, and Theodor Ziegler. 48 For Leibniz's use of the principle of sufficient reason see C. D. Broad, Leibniz: An Introduction (ed. C. Lewy), London, 1975, pp. 10-12. Broad quoted Leibniz on his principle as 'Nothing happens without it being possible to have a reason why it happened as it did and not in another way.' For Leibniz's use of the principle as the agent of selection, pp. 31-5, though this is not the point Broad was trying to make. For Schopenhauer's use of the principle see his On the Fourfold Roots of the Principle of Sufficient Reason (tr. E. F. J. Payne), LaSalle, Ill.: [1813, 2nd rev. edn 1847], 1974. Though Schopenhauer gave Leibniz little credit for the development of the principle, his definition was the same: 'Nothing is without a ground or reason why it is' (p. 6). According to Schopenhauer (pp. 30-45) the first great advance in understanding the principle was taken by Kant in his Uber eine Entdeckung, nach der alle neue Kritik der reinen Vernuft durch eine altere entberlich gemacht werden soll (1790), when he differentiated between the principle as used in formal logic as the necessity of having sufficient ground for a conclusion and its use as necessary cause. 49 For the question of conflation, see in general P. M. Heimann, 'Helmholtz and Kant: The Metaphysical Foundations of Ueber die Erhaltung der Kraft', Studies in History and Philosophy of Science, (1974), 5, pp. 221-3, and for the question whether Kant himself conflated the order that we suppose to exist in nature with that imposed by our cognitive constitution see the debate between Gerd Buchdahl ('The Conception of Lawlikeness 2 BHS 24</page><page sequence="14">34 S. P. Fullinwider the situation by holding that the cognitive apparatus (operating according to transcendental forms and categories of the sensibility) translates the Will's blind strivings into the several levels of organization, from the relatively low level of organization of matter to the higher levels of organic forms. In his Metaphysical Foundations of Natural Science (1786), Kant introduced his central forces theory that Schopenhauer was to adopt: a central force of attraction acting in a straight line between two points of matter holds them together (otherwise all material points would be randomly distributed throughout the universe); but to keep all points of matter from being drawn together into a single point an opposing force of repulsion (also acting in a straight line between points) is to be presumed. Repulsion accounts for the extension and impenetrability of matter. Schopenhauer argued that central forces constitute a first step in the Will's 'blind striving'."5 Though Kant was furnishing grounds for the apparent stability of the material world Schopenhauer believed the central forces to be entirely unstable: just as the Will is constantly struggling for organization through self-objectification there is the equally powerful tendency towards disorganization.5' The blind striving Schopenhauer envisioned was not unlike the unlimited variations Darwin described as the stage preliminary to natural selection. Nature selects from the near-infinity of possibilities the variations provide.52 Nor are the blind strivings and the variations of those respective theories very different from the realm of infinite possibility Leibniz described as the range of potential events from which the divine selects out worldly order. In fact, Leibniz's principle of sufficient reason had approximately the same selecting function as Darwin's principle of natural selection. In Schopenhauer's hands sufficient reason provided the logic by which the Will is objectified. The Will's blind strivings are outside human experience. They become manifest in objective form only because the cognitive constitution imposes time, space, and necessary cause; that is, organization. These a priori forms and categories taken together can be described as sufficient reason because their objects are necessarily what they are. No other objects are thinkable, for the reason that the existent objects are the objects of thought. Schopenhauer held that the Will (the thing in itself) finds various levels of objectification, from the lowest (e.g. chemical and physical laws and forces) to higher (e.g. life forces and laws). These several levels are so to speak in perpetual struggle with each other, the higher expending its energies battling the lower only, finally, to succumb to the lower and fall to it in death: The permanent matter must constantly change its form; for under the guidance of causality, mechanical, physical, chemical, and organic phenomena, eagerly striving to appear, wrest the matter from each other, and each desires to reveal its own idea.53 in Kant's Philosophy of Science', Synthese, (1971), 23, pp. 24-6, and 'The Kantian "Dynamic of Reason," with Special Reference to the Place of Causality in Kant's System', Kant Studies Today (ed.

Schopenhauer's notion of struggle did not, however, lead him beyond the idea of struggle for existence to that of the evolution of species. He described species as the objectified forms through which the Will advances on its way towards self-knowledge. Individuals come into existence and die, leaving their corpses behind in lower levels of organization, but species are eternal: the individual struggles that they may remain that way.55 On its positive side, as Schopenhauer defined it, the struggle for existence is a struggle to preserve the species; on its negative side it is a battle against decay. This definition became important to German physiology when the pathological anatomist Carl Rokitansky succumbed to Schopenhauer's philosophy. Rokitansky (1804-79),56 founder of the Second Vienna Medical School, president of Vienna's Academy of Sciences (1869-78), and the first freely elected president of the University of Vienna (1852-53), developed Schopenhauer's philosophy and its implications in talks in 1867 and 1869 to the Academy of Sciences. In the first, 'The Independent Value of Knowledge', he suggested that had Kant followed through with his own arguments he would have arrived at Schopenhauer's epistemology. Our experience, he said, is the consequence of the projection of subjective representations, '... die Verlegung der Dinge in der Raum, demgemass wir sie ausser Dinge vorstellen'. 57 In his 1869 'Solidarity of All Animal Life' Rokitansky tackled the struggle for existence and developed a Kant-Schopenhauer stand-in for social Darwinism. He presented his notion of 'protoplasmic hunger' as the physiological embodiment of Schopenhauer's notion of the struggle between different stages of the will. Rokitansky found the tendency in all 'organized matter' (organic) to decay back into the unorganized. The will to resist decay is expressed as hunger, 'protoplasmic hunger'. The actual struggle against decay is expressed as the aggression that is at the core of the struggle for existence. All animal activity is aggression because it is rooted in resistance to decay.58 The next logical step, that of putting Rokitansky's two notions together to make the projection of Kant's transcendental forms an act of aggression in the struggle for existence was undertaken by Rokitansky's disciple Theodor Meynert (1833-92). Following Meynert's 1865 Structure and Function of the Brain and Spinal Cord with Regard to Diseases of these Organs, Rokitansky took the young brain-anatomist under his wing to conduct him up the ladder of success in Viennese psychiatry. Meynert reciprocated handsomely by calling his mentor a 'colossus' of medicine and 'giant of science'59 and by adopting his ideas as the foundations of his own work. 54 Ibid., pp. 191-2. 55 Ibid., p. 356. 56 See, Erma Lesky, The Vienna Medical School of the 19th Century (tr.

P. Fullinwider Meynert's first principle was that cognition is aggression. He portrayed the cognitive apparatus in that light: the cortical mantle was a great 'mollusc' that sends its sensory nerves out as feelers (Fulfaden) and its motor nerves as tentacles (Fangarmen) to seize its prey, the sensory impressions from the outside world.60 Once the prey or 'booty' is 'seized' (bemachtigt) and 'devoured' (verschlingt) it is dealt with in the way described by Helmholtz, that is by way of the unconscious inference and projection of representations structured by time, space, and causal relations.6' Meynert also built on Rokitansky in an effort to develop a sort of social Darwinism without Darwin. Rokitansky had not turned to evolutionary theory in his talks; Meynert did but in a way that made Darwin irrelevant. In his 1888 lecture on 'Brain and Civilization' he said that Darwin teaches that the struggle for existence arises unavoidably out of the inclination of all organisms to multiply.62 But this insight into evolutionary theory played no part in the subsequent discussion of the struggle for existence and its putative relation to civilization. Darwin used the term struggle in an extremely loose, even metaphorical sense. Locusts 'struggle' against cattle by eating their grass.63 The notion that aggression is the dynamic behind evolution was not Darwin's. Rokitansky had held that it is the repression of aggression that makes civilization possible. But beyond that, in 'The Solidarity of All Animal Life' he transformed group aggression against the world beyond the group into a social instinct. Meynert adopted this idea and used it to build a notion that anticipated Freud's idea of sublimation. Meynert pictured the cortex as a 'colony' or even a 'republic of living cells' cooperating together in their aggressions on the outside world: 'The nerve fibres, which are excited in this sense from the cortex ... are comparable to tentacles which the brain cells send out as if in aggression against the outside world. '64 Thus aggression becomes the driving dynamic in the formation of civilization, the highest form of organization. This sort of thinking fed back into Meynert's description of the cognitive structure. He depicted what might be called a hunger-projection-incorporation brain model. All people except the retarded and the insane, Meynert said, have two selves or 'I's'. One I intends only the maximization of sensual pleasure. This I is narrow and animal and resides in the subcortical brain centres. The other I, the 'secondary I', is expansive and 'associates itself with the idea of mutuality, reciprocity, brotherhood. Just as we strive to nourish the body, so there lies in the secondary I a lasting tendency to grow. It annexes, holds fast, defends as its possession everything that is part of the feeling of aggression that we also can name the feeling of luck'65 60 Theodor Meynert, 'Das Zusammenwirken der Gehirntheile' (1890), ibid., p. 204; Psychiatry: A Clinical Treatise on Diseases of the Fore-Brain (tr.

They are, he said, the 'place of formation of mutuality'.66 Thus his argument was that the struggle for existence renders ever higher forms of organization, completing itself in society (social organization); it does this under compulsion of the force of aggression operating through the cognitive processes. As the individual loses his individuality (primary I) in the group he incorporates the group in his higher self (secondary I). We find here an evolutionary theory of sorts. It owed little to Darwin, much to Schopenhauer. It was Sigmund Exner in an 1892 essay on 'Morality as a Weapon in the Struggle for Existence' (later incorporated into his Entwurf as its culminating section) who tried to weave the Schopenhauer-Rokitansky-Meynert tradition together with his understanding of Darwin to produce a German language social Darwinism. From the former side he took the notion of innate aggression as expression of Kant's thing-in-itself. From Helmholtz, Briicke, and his own work on cognition, he drew on the idea of the unconscious inference. From his understanding of Darwin (a neo-Lamarckian approach shared by his colleagues and masters) he took the theory of the transmission of acquired characteristics. The result was to put the finishing touches to the hunger-projection-incorporation theory. Quoting Meynert to the effect that the 'pleasurable coloured affect is associated with aggressiveness, the unpleasurable with defensiveness',67 adding his own opinion that the 'pleasure centre' is a motor attack centre, the 'unpleasure centre' a motor defence centre and that the sensation of pleasure appears as the impulse to 'seize' (ergreifen), to 'capture' (festzuhalten) and take possession,68 Exner proved himself ready to accept his friend's picture of aggression as the expansive impulse upon which mutuality is built, defensiveness as being individualistic and anti-social. But, Exner explained, to become these things those inclinations to seize, capture and take possession must be associated with particular representations (Vorstellungen). So Exner turned to the transmission of acquired characteristics to support an assertion that we have inborn faculties (Fdhigkeiten) that integrate particular representations (e.g. heroic actions) with particular 'intense sensations' (e.g. pride). And although these inborn faculties were to be seen as mere abilities or perhaps tendencies which must be reinforced and made specific by education, still in his mind they were powerful. They were powerful to the extent of deserving the term 'social instincts', or even 'fixed ideas': 'The concepts of good and bad', he wrote, 'of virtue and vice rest on sensations belonging to human social instincts 69 Exner found he had discovered a potent brew in the combined notions of transmitted acquired characteristics and unconscious inferences. He turned to Gustav Theodor Fechner to find the right language: thoughts (Gedanken) for which one can give no account, Wachstumtendenz, Alles, was sich unter Gefuhlen der Aggression, die wir auch Glicksgefuhle nennen konnen, ihm angliedert, halt es fest, vertheidigt seinen Besitz...' 66 Ibid., p. 178. 67 Sigmund Exner, 'Die Moral as Waffe in Kampf ums Dasien,' Vienna, 1892, p. 248.

Fullinwider thoughts with no conscious ground, thoughts that 'invade' (einfallt) and 'seize' (anwandeln). 70 This group of fixed ideas, this voice of the race is, he held, cherished in our breasts as that which can be summed up in the word 'duty'. And: Man must always answer Kant's 'from where do you [duty] come?' through that Fechnerian Spirit that in him thinks 'from another centre than his own,' i.e., never on the basis of the experience of the person, always on the basis of the experience of the whole.71 Exner's formulation was this: particular moral commandments are inculcated by education, but the general injunction 'thou shalt' is a natural law of our being as social creatures. In so asserting he was but restating in evolutionary form the point Rokitansky made in his 'Solidarity of All Animal Life'. These considerations led Exner to articulate an ethic. The 'moral' is that which is useful to society. He liked to illustrate his point with Sophocles' Oedipus Rex. Without knowledge of what he was doing, said Exner, Oedipus killed his own father and 'married' his own mother. The ancients knew that he was rightly punished. No matter that he did not consciously sin; no matter that his motives were pure; he nevertheless acted against the group interest. We moderns have lost that realization. In violation of nature's demands on us we have begun to judge individuals on the basis of their private motives.72 Thus (to summarize) Exner's synthesis of the two Kantian strands elevated the Schopenhauer-based hunger-projection-incorporation notion of cognitive processes (and with it Meynert's aggressive mollusc brain) to the position of nature's instrument in the achievement of ever-higher orders of organization. Exner epitomized his vision in the statement that duty is a weapon (Waffe) in the struggle for existence and by reproducing his essay on ethics as the final section of his treatise on the cognitive processes. Those processes culminate in the ethics of duty because they act in the service of aggression, the force that both preserves the species and drives nature on to higher stages of organization. Perhaps most importantly, just as the notion of sufficient reason as a physical process (necessary cause) enabled Helmholtz, via his notions of conflation, to visualize integration of the cognitive processes into the laws of physics and chemistry and at the same time not only to assert the comprehensibility of those laws but to hold that same comprehensibility to be some sort of self-manifestation of lawlikeness, so Exner believed his version of evolutionary theory enabled him not only to make ethics (as part of the cognitive process) a law of nature but to make each of us one of nature's unwitting instruments in the 'pursuit of its own goals'. In the pursuit of our 'duty' he said, quite cryptically, nature 'deceives' us into acting to achieve its goals.73 70 Ibid. 71 Ibid., p. 253. 'die Pflicht.

In 1895 Sigmund Freud worked up his extended essay on the same subject, the physiology of cognition, in what has become known in English as the 'Project for a Scientific Psychology'. Important differences of approach distinguish the two works. Freud's undergraduate rejection of Kantian epistemology74 accounts for some of the differences. Again, Freud was coming at the physiology of cognition from the direction of his clinical work in psychopathology and certain important discoveries he had recorded in his (with Josef Breuer) Studies on Hysteria (1895). Finally, and perhaps as important, in his 1891 On Aphasia Freud abandoned the Meynert mollusc brain model in favour of one developed by the British neurologist, John Hughlings Jackson.7" In On Aphasia Freud argued that recent histological evidence disproved Meynert's contention that the cortex sends its nervous fibres outwards to all points on the periphery and that consequently all sensory events go unmodified to the cortex. Freud argued also that the Jackson 'integrative level' theory better explained the facts of word deafness. Jackson's brain-model was built to the specifications of Herbert Spencer's theory that the human nervous system has retained, in the form of lower integrative levels, 'primitive' man's mental functioning. Accordingly the primitive lower levels continue to function unconsciously even while, at least in the brains of advanced civilized man, the highest ('propositional') level is conscious and functioning.76 Jackson argued that the brain-damaged (and by extension, the mentally ill) function normally but on a lower functional level. By adopting the Jackson model Freud was able to hold that all sorts of things - the exclamations of the brain-damaged, the hallucinations of the psychotic, the dreams of the normal - are not the disorganized confusion demanded by the Meynert model77 but lawlike and thoroughly intelligible mentation operating on a different level of analysis from that of waking consciousness. Thus his oft-repeated assertion that every element of a dream is determined.78 Thus the possibility of analysing dreams. So the Jackson model served Freud well in the 1895 Project when he turned the discussion to 'Irma's Injection', the dream that convinced him that dreaming is wish- fulfilment,79 and when he turned to writing the seminal Interpretation of Dreams (1900). Did Freud thus forever discard the Meynert-Exner hunger-projection-incorporation model? Arguably not.

Frank Sulloway has demonstrated the inadequacy of Freud's 'evolutionary/ involutional model of the libido' (approximately equivalent to what I have been calling the Jackson model of the brain) to deal with his developing theory of erotogenesis, for example, the notion of 'aim-regression'."8 In so far as space allows, I will suggest that as the Jackson model became inadequate to his theory of erotogenesis in general, and to his instinct drive theory in particular,8' Freud fell back upon the model of his teachers even to the point where he found use for Kantian epistemology. A significant part of the Project that did not easily fit into the Jackson model was the 'primary process', the notion that the primary function of the nervous system is tension reduction.82 Hunger, respiration and sex were given there as the sources of endogenous tension. In the identification of tension reduction and pleasure we find Freud turning to assumptions made by the Meynert-Exner model. But the Project was silent on the notion of union between tension reduction (pleasure) and aggression that Meynert adopted from Rokitansky, made central to his system, and then passed along to Exner. Freud developed his thoughts on that union only later within the context of his theory of erotogenesis, given form subsequent to the Project. Sulloway traced Freud's ideas about erotogenesis back to their beginnings in letters of December 1895 and November 1897. Full development awaited the much later (1905) Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality.83 In Three Essays hunger became the model for the libido: The fact of the existence of sexual needs in human beings and animals is expressed in biology by the assumption of a 'sexual instinct', on the analogy of the instinct of nutrition, that is of hunger. Everyday language possesses no counterpart to the word 'hunger', but science makes use of the word 'libido' for that purpose.84 And again: The normal sexual aim is regarded as being the union of the genitals in the act known as copulation, which leads to a release of the sexual tension and a temporary extinction of the sexual instinct - a satisfaction analogous to the sating of hunger.85 In 1915 Freud added to his Three Essays the statement that the infant's satisfaction at the mother's breast is a 'prototype of the expression of sexual satisfaction in later life '.86 As he got into the question of sadism in that work he made a close link between sexual gratification and aggressiveness. Sadism, he said, arises 'from the instinct for mastery', and the 'sexuality of most male human beings contains an element of aggressiveness - a desire to subjugate.. ' 87 The element of 'incorporation' was also very much present in Three Essays. Freud described the oral stage of erotogenesis as 'cannibalistic'. The sexual activity at that stage 80 Sulloway, op. cit.

He made the oral stage incorporation the 'prototype' of the process of 'identification ',88 the process by which the ego ideal (later the 'super ego') is developed, or, in short, the process by which we are socialized. Arguably the development of erotogenic theory and the pleasure-aggression nexus as we see them in Three Essays exerted a steady if gradual tug away from the Jackson model towards the Meynert-Exner hunger-projection-incorporation framework. An equally gradual and very tentative flirtation with Kantian epistemology can be detected as part of that movement, in so far as Kant's explanations could be made compatible with theories of projection. There was nothing of Kant in the 'Project'. Exner's use of the Helmholtzian unconscious inference involved the coming into consciousness of 'secondary sensations' via the logical process of abstraction and generalization (summation of the excitations of like sensory impressions) and the psychological process of projection. The cognitive apparatus constructs the object that it experiences in the Kantian manner. Freud made use of Exner's facilitations and inhibitions and excitation summations in the 'Project', but he did not permit these things, in themselves, to define his objects, much less bring them into consciousness. In the tradition of naive realism he held the object to be directly and immediately perceived. Something directly perceived is already in waking consciousness, otherwise to become conscious it needs to be associated with a word: 'One shuts one's eyes and hallucinates; one opens them and thinks in words.'89 It was not until he turned to the discussion of paranoia in his 1911 commentary on the Schreber case90 that Freud made any significant use of the concept of projection.91 And like most notions he touched it came from his pen in radically altered form. Redefinition of the Kantian transcendental processes into the concepts of psychology and physiology had almost inevitably led to the proposition that subjective processes are projected outwardly as the object is formed in experience. Projection was an unstated part of Helmholtz's concept of the unconscious inference. Rokitansky carried it a step along in his assertion that the imposition of the Kantian forms and categories involves the projection also of one's personality. Rokitansky was very close to holding that the act of cognition is anthropomorphic: we project the 'quality, form, size and power' of the perceived world.92 Exner, building on Brucke, added the point that there is a basic self-deception involved in perceiving colour, sound, taste and form in a universe composed of atomic events. Projection became nature's way of deceiving us into doing its work of organization. The projection Freud made famous in the Schreber case consisted in transposing one's own disguised emotions onto the object in order to avoid feeling the guilt involved in having those particular emotions. Self-deception had here become an ego defence mechanism on the order of, for example, the obsession. One disguises one's homosexual 88 Ibid., p. 198. 89 Freud, op. cit.

Fullinwider love in the following manner: 'I do not love him - I hate him because he persecutes me.' The hate disguises the love but even that can not be permitted into consciousness, so it is externalized into the environment as the other's hatred and persecution of me.93 Two years later, in the 1913 Totem and Taboo Freud radically generalized the notion of projection. He made it the explanation of primitive 'animism', which he took to be pre-literate man's Weltanschauung. As such it was to be considered a key to what he and his contemporaries called the 'primitive mind '.94 Taken within the context of the Jacksonian model, projection might be seen as important to the functioning of the lower integrative level, the level of dreams. And it began to emerge in Freud's mind, by extension, as a key to the operation of the neuroses. He began, also, to argue that its prototype is the 'secondary revision' by which we try to make waking sense out of our dreams.95 I will return to this shortly. A second way Freud used projection in Totem and Taboo suggests that he was being drawn, however hesitantly, into the Kantian epistemology of the Meynert-Exner model. Projection, he said, is common in normal as well as pathological cognition. It is, he wrote: not created for the purpose of defence; it also occurs where there is conflict. The projection outwards of internal perceptions is a primitive mechanism, to which, for instance, our sense perceptions are subject, and which therefore normally plays a very large part in determining the form taken by our external world.96 Not in itself a repudiation of British empiricism, that statement does suggest a backing away from the 'Project's' naive realism. But in the same passage Freud implied something more: Under conditions whose nature has not yet been sufficiently established, internal perceptions of emotional and thought processes can be projected outward in the same way as sense perceptions; they are employed for building up the external world.97 It may be that under certain circumstances we act like Kantians. We project more than sensation, we project thought processes. Under what circumstances do we project thought processes, and what is the nature of the processes we project? In Totem and Taboo Freud held that before the language of abstract thought was created men did not have the wherewithal to define their internal processes and isolate them from the external world. Men were unable to distinguish those processes from external events. Thus projection.98 The result was animism, the prototype of which is secondary revision. Freud dealt at length with secondary revision in the 1900 Interpretation of Dreams. He described how our 'waking thinking' or 'normal thinking' approaches the content of dreams with the demand that it be 'intelligible': 'It is in the nature of our waking thought to establish order in material of that kind, to set up relations in it and to make it conform to our expectations of an intelligible whole.' He added that like the dream itself the secondary revision is in the service of the 'censor'.99 That is, it manifests our resistance to 93 Freud, op. cit.

(78), p. 499.</page><page sequence="23">Darwin faces Kant 43 the true meaning of the dream (to the wishes it is fulfilling). Thus our demand for intelligibility (a demand emanating from the preconscious) results in even further self- deception. Implicit in the discussion of secondary revision is the assumption of an identity between the demand for intelligibility and a need for self-deception: that is, intelligibility emerges as an ego-defence. The assumption became explicit in Totem and Taboo. Primitive man, unable to abstract and generalize, projects the primitive processes of his mind (processes limited to the mechanisms - contiguity, simultaneity, etc. - of the association of ideas) onto the external world. The result was a magical or animistic world view that externalizes the Oedipal-derived guilt. The external world becomes thereby intelligible, but a wish- fulfilling dream for all that. Prior to Totem and Taboo Freud seldom relied on the notion of projection, least of all in his theories of the neuroses. By the time of the 1920 Beyond the Pleasure Principle he had changed his mind as to its importance. And the-more he changed his mind on projection the more he turned to Kantian epistemology. 'Projection', he said in the 1920 work, 'play[s] such a large part in the causation of pathological processes'. He added that 'as a result of certain psycho-analytic discoveries, we are today in a position to embark on a discussion of the Kantian theorem that time and space are "necessary forms of thought"'.'. He proceeded to hint (his term) at the possibility that time (and presumably space) is derived from the 'method of working of the system Pcpt.-Cs' (the perceptual apparatus) and that they are imposed upon the incoming stimuli as a shield.101 Presumably the uncontrolled inrush of stimuli would be a disorganized and disorganizing chaos, a notion not radically distinguishable from Schopenhauer's belief that the cognitive apparatus imposes form on the uncontrolled energies that constitute reality. In Beyond the Pleasure Principle Freud had the defensive apparatus (the censor) externalizing (projecting) an instinctual drive which then became part of the incoming stimuli to be shielded against by the Kantian forms. He speculated that the skin serves as a physical shield against incoming stimuli (e.g. light) which if not thus restrained would register on the sensory nerves not as warmth but as pain. The instinctual drive that Freud described as being externalized by the censor was the newly-conceptualized 'death instinct'. Apparently (Freud is less than explicit on this) the energies of the death wish are disorganizing ones, and the shielding done by the Kantian forms is in defence of organization (the 'coherent ego')."' The death wish emerged in Freud's mind as the association between pleasure and aggression broke down following his realization that in many cases of neurosis the individual seeks to relive a painful experience ('repetition compulsion'). Freud thus visualized an instinct prior to tension-reduction, this is the instinct to return to earlier evolutionary stages: we cannot escape a suspicion that we may have come upon the track of a universal attribute of instincts and perhaps of organic life in general ... It seems, then, that an instinct is an urge inherent in organic life to restore an earlier state of things which the living entity has been obliged to abandon under the pressure of external disturbing forces...103 100 Sigmund Freud, Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920), Vol 18, S.E., pp. 29, 28. 101 Ibid., p. 28. 102 Ibid., p. 29. 103 Ibid., p. 36.</page><page sequence="24">44 S. P. Fullinwider In so saying, Freud cited both Ewald Hering (Professor of Physiology, University of Vienna, 1865-70) and Schopenhauer. He had been drawn back towards the Rokitansky-Meynert hunger-projection-incorporation model. But he added his own unique twist, based on his long-held belief that much about our cognitive functionings is explained when we view them as ego defences. The point in Beyond the Pleasure Principle was that the death wish is experienced as danger coming from the environment. Projection was made a defensive operation: by projecting the death wish outward the Kantian forms can be used as shields. The forms thus act in the service of -organization against the threat of disorganization, the falling back to inorganic matter in death. We are thus able to say that the Kant-Darwin synthesis developed within nineteenth-century German physiology did have a (somewhat belated) influence upon one of the creators of the twentieth century, Sigmund Freud.</page></plain_text>
