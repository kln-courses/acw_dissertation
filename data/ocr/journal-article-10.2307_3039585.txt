<plain_text><page sequence="1">Aminadab in Hawthorne's "The Birthmark" There have been many interpretations of Hawthorne's "The Birth- mark," none of which has considered the source of the name Aminadab. One of the more recent and definitive exegeses is R. B. Heilman's detailed study, "Hawthorne's 'The Birthmark': Science and Religion," an article centered about the terminology and imagery of religion in the story as Hawthorne has applied them to science. Science, according to Heilman, has assumed the one-time preroga- tives of religion, and Aylmer, the scientist-priest of the new cult, seems less priest than God.'~ It is at precisely this point of Heilman's interpretation that Aminadab, Aylmer's laboratory underworker, as- sumes a significance which Heilman does not accord him. Aminadab, a variant of Amminadab, receives mention ten times in the Bible. The gist of these references is that he was a high priest and the head of a family, a Levite, of that tribe which could X'Edward Dowden, Shelley (London, 1886), 1, 479, misinterprets here.

Upon Aminadab and his fellows was devolved the administration of the rites peculiar to Yahweh, the tribal deity of a primitive and nomad people. If it is agreed that Hawthorne had the historical Aminadab in mind, then Aminadab becomes a most important symbol in the story, one in perfect consonance with the religious imagery collated by Heilman. Aminadab becomes more than just a foil for Aylmer, more than just "the earthy, gross side of man's nature" as remarked by Brooks and Warren.' On the vehicular level he is the unimaginative assistant and subordinate of the intellectual Aylmer; on a more complex level he typifies religion subverted to the ends of science. Aminadab is a symbol of an early authority which is now dis- credited; the priestcraft for which he stands is no longer significant. Men are no longer a primitive priest-ridden people, and indeed the priest himself has been relegated to a subordinate and contemptu- ously regarded role. From his sacrificial fire Aminadab no longer raises his grimly ecstatic face to the equally grimly ecstatic face of his anthropomorphic Yahweh. He stoops and drudges, a priest without votaries, his face "grimed with the vapors of the furnace," 3 and answers to the beck and call of the imperious new man as personified by Aylmer. Aylmer's star is in the ascendant, Aminadab's in decline. The tension underlying the external relations o-f Aylmer and Aminadab remains for the most part hidden. Aylmer is perhaps too serenely confident of himself and scornful of his servant to be aware of it, and Aminadab is in no position to assault the bastion of science which Aylmer represents. And this from the standpoint of sheer artis- try is as it should be; the conflict between science and authoritarian religion is not the motif of the tale even though it does reflect what we know to have been Hawthorne's apprehensions concerning the budding brave new world of the nineteenth century. If we acknowledge the ramifications, as sketched above, implicit in Hawthorne's choice of the name Aminadab, then Aminadab's mut- tered comment "' If she were my wife, I'd never part with that birth- mark' "1 assumes a deeper significance than has heretofore been ac- corded it. It is not the remark, as most commentators aver, of a gross 2 Cleanth Brooks, Jr. and Robert Penn Warren, Understanding Fiction (New York, 1943), p. 105. 8Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Complete Works, ed.

The old authoritarian re- ligion, in spite of its excesses, had a greater respect for the human personality than has amoral science. Such an interpretation of the comment seems not inconsistent with the author's ambivalent attitude towards his Puritan heritage, nor does Aminadab viewed in this new light detract from the recognized theme of the story. On the other hand, it adds somewhat to the texture of a richly complex tale. 7Texas Technological College W. R. THOMPSON</page></plain_text>
