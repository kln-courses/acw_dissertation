<plain_text><page sequence="1">A newly discovered corpus of Vitruvian images CLAUDIO SGARBI A little-known Vitruvian manuscript in the Biblioteca Ariostea of Ferrara throws unexpected light on the history and theory of architecture. The manuscript, written and illustrated toward the end of the fifteenth or the first years of the sixteenth century, is the earliest surviving attempt to combine the text of Vitruvius's De architectura with a programmatic apparatus of illustrations. It must therefore be considered a completely original, perhaps revolutionary, work.1 Vitruvius mentioned in De architectura nine or ten drawings distributed irregularly in the Ten Books, which perhaps were diagrams introduced where verbal descriptions were awkward or inconclusive. These original drawings were neglected by medieval copyists: of the six major extant manuscripts, only one (Harleianus 2697) contains a small diagram, a wind rose in the margin of the first Book.2 Because it was the only treatise on architecture to have survived from Greco-Roman culture, De architectura was transcribed, abridged, and manipulated during the Middle Ages. Indeed, it was attentively analyzed, having been both printed and translated, from the late fifteenth century onward. Yet, despite all this attention, only sparse and disorganized attempts to illustrate the text were made. Fra Giocondo was apparently the first to provide illustrations for it in his printed edition of 1511. Subsequently, inaccurate and often misleading illustrations proliferated.3 The declared aim of all those who concerned themselves with this task was to illuminate the obscurity and ambiguity of the written words by means of clear graphic representations.4 But a simple comparison of the different illustrations that were made for the many editions of Vitruvius since the sixteenth century would show that written text and image never correspond to each other in a predictable or unambiguous manner. Yet the illustrations came to exercise such an attraction on the viewer that they freed the interpreter from too strict an adherence to the words, simultaneously placing other limits on the possibilities of interpretation. In this respect the Ferrara manuscript is significant: on many pages the drawings and the words move, as it were, in two separate sequences; they are sometimes parallel, at other times tangential, divergent, or intersecting. Occasionally, text and image are too remote from each other to be considered commensurable with Vitruvian sense. The following commentary is divided into three parts: section I raises philological questions concerning the document; sections II and III are an interpretation of two crucial points?scamilli impares and homo bene figuratus?that illustrate the originality and the importance of the Ferrara manuscript; and section III summarizes the hypotheses on the attribution and the context for this unique document. Finally, the appendix provides an index of the Ferrara manuscript. I. The document The catalog of the Biblioteca Ariostea of Ferrara describes the manuscript under examination as 1. This article, written two years ago, represents the first approach to the study of this important document, which is the topic of my dissertation in the Ph.D. program in architecture at the University of Pennsylvania. I am particularly grateful to the historian Grazia Biondi, who invited me first to see the manuscript in Ferrara and has been helping me in the philological research. Joseph Rykwert's initial support, and incisive comments are gratefully acknowledged. Herman van Bergeijk, Professor Albano Biondi, Richard Bul lene, Professor Marco Frascari, Professor Lothar Hasel berger, Professor David Leatherbarrow, Gray Read, Professor Robert Saintgeorge, and Rebecca Williamson gave me important suggestions. I thank particularly Dr. Alessandra Chiappini, director of the Biblioteca Ariostea at Ferrara, for her assistance and permission to reproduce the manuscript. I wish to express special appreciation to Becky Brimacombe and Cynthia Elmas, who edited and revised this article. 2. Concerning Harleianus 2767 (British Museum), see L. W.

Pollio, Architecture (imperfect work starting from Book seven)."5 It was left to the library in the will of Gianmaria Riminaldi, a judge of the Sacred Rota, in 1779. This bequest consisted of writings by various Ferrarese authors that had been collected by the two previous generations of the Riminaldis, an old and noble Ferrarese family. A letter accompanying the bequest mentions two volumes of indexes, which have not yet been traced, but which could illuminate the manuscript's attribution.6 The catalog description suggests that the work is a fragment. In fact, all of Vitruvius's Ten Books were included, in varying degrees of completeness (see appendix). The sequence of folios is not in the original order (the first page starts with the first chapter of Book VII, hence the catalog error), but this is the result of a hasty rebinding carried out recently (Modena 1959). The manuscript's humanistic handwriting, as well as the type and the frequency of its abbreviations, is certainly consistent with a late-fifteenth-century date. Among the manuscript's 107 folios (21.4 cm x 29.5 cm) are three distinct watermarks: an anchor, a crossbow inscribed in a circle and often accompanied by two letters on each side of the shaft, and a pair of scales with round pans, partially inscribed in a circle. Such sheets of paper were produced in Venice around the last decade of the fifteenth century.7 Altogether there are 127 illustrations, as well as a number of blank spaces clearly destined for other illustrations. Some drawings were washed in watercolors; others were sketched in pencil and traced over with india ink, often obscured with white and then redrawn; a few were annotated with red ink or sketched with sanguine. As for the text, it has not yet been possible to establish whether it was based on another manuscript or on one of the early printed editions. The passages analyzed so far show kinship with the families of Vitruvian manuscripts derived either from the Harleian or Gudianus codex. The resemblance to the Venetian edition of 1497 is also very striking.8 That only Books IX and X are complete seems to imply that the transcriber began at the end of the treatise. The author might have been interested primarily in machinery, sundials, and astronomy, intending to complete the work thereafter. To copy the Books in a different order from that in which they are read today is not necessarily odd, because the sequence of Vitruvius's Books cannot be taken for granted. The last three, especially, could easily occupy different positions in the treatise.9 Nevertheless, it is clear that the transcription was not carried out in one single operation. The handwriting shows that the writer was well rested at times with a fluent calligraphy, and wrote slowly and stiffly at other times. His work was not simply a matter of transcription or correction but required decisions about how the text was to be edited and illustrated: this operation would have demanded lengthy study, even from the most learned artists of the period. The author just may not have had enough time to complete the manuscript, which contains nine blank folios. On the other hand, certain sentences that end in an "etc." imply that lacunae were deliberate and foreseen. In fact, the scholar who edited this transcription of Vitruvius may have envisaged an amended and abbreviated version of the text. Manuscript 132 at Wolfenb?ttel and the short adaptation of M. Celtius Faventinus are examples of abbreviations that were intended to rid the Ten Books of "extraneous" material, as Carol Krinsky pointed out.10 The compiler of the Ferrara manuscript was inclined to pass over digressions and anecdotes and to seek out the more concrete and practical passages: the first and second Books are full of omissions, and the prefaces are suppressed in the first five Books. However, all the practical suggestions about sites, materials, and construction techniques in the first 5. " Vitruvius M.

The mistaken catalog entry?"incipit enim a libro s?ptimo"?may have misled scholars: neither Carol Herselle Krinsky ("Seventy-eight Vitruvius Manuscripts," Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes 30 [1967]: 36-70) nor Otto Kristeller (Iter Italicum, 3 vols. [Leiden: Brill, 1965-1968]) appears to have come across the manuscript. Nor, to my knowledge, has it been mentioned by any other authors, although a short study has recently attributed it to Pellegrino Prisciani, a scholar working in Ferrara at the end of the sixteenth century.

The scribe seems to have worked in a disorderly manner, collecting and transcribing here and there whatever caught his fancy. The most plausible hypothesis may well be that the manuscript is a sort of "personal notebook": the deliberate lacunae (indicated by "etc.") and the extremely frequent use of abbreviations suggest that it was written for personal use.11 Moreover, most passages include several corrections, which were not intended to undermine Vitruvian principles, as were, for example, Raphael's notes to Fabio Calvo Ravennate's version of the Ten Books,12 but rather to clarify the obscure language of Vitruvius. Still, although the hand and the manner of transcription implies private usage, the refinement of most of the illustrations leads one to believe that the Ferrara manuscript was to be shown to other people. Could it be that the text had a private role while the illustrations had a public one? Perhaps private lessons or conversations were held in front of a restricted audience, and the drawings on paper played the same role then that slides play in public lectures today. The compiler of the Ferrara manuscript seems to have had three major aims: (1) to set De architectura apart from other antique architectural works, (2) to organize it into chapters, and (3) to compose many pages graphically by having the illustrations coincide with each other. The compiler's first aim, which may seem banal but should not be underestimated, was to give a special place to the text of Vitruvius by setting it apart from the corpus of antique literature. Most of the manuscripts consulted in this study combine Vitruvius with other texts; even the first printed editions of the Ten Books were bound with the De aqueductibus of Frontinus or with the Armonicum introductorium of Cleonides, because De architectura was regarded not as a specialist handbook but as a fragment of the general classical heritage.13 The first editors of Vitruvius (Giovanni Sulpicio da Veroli, Pomponio Leto, Girolamo Avogadro, Vittor Pisano, and Giorgio Valla) were all humanists dedicated to the study of antiquity:14 they were interested not in construing a single text in isolation but in the contribution each text made to the reconstruction of a vanished culture. Even when, a few years later (1513), the De architectura of Vitruvius was printed in a pocket edition of breviary size, "purified and corrected," it was still combined with De aqueductibus. The compiler's attempts to subdivide the Ten Books of Vitruvius into chapters, to give at least some of them titles, and subsequently to divide chapters into paragraphs were original. Although a rough division into chapters was made in the first printed editions?Fra Giocondo first refined and fixed it?the extant early Vitruvian manuscripts are subdivided only into books each of which has a space reserved for the introduction. Indeed, Vitruvian manuscripts before the fifteenth century were written without punctuation or syntactic devices. It was not until the early nineteenth century that Schneider introduced the numbering of the paragraphs.15 As can be read now, the Ten Books were the result of a long transformation of the text itself. Moreover, the compiler of the Ferrara manuscript attempted to construct most of the pages graphically: the text and the illustrations were put together on the folio to form a new visual, tactile, and conceptual unit (figs. 1-4). Such links between text and illustrations in the Ferrara manuscript were articulated more thoroughly than in either the Vitruvius of Fra Giocondo or of Cesare Cesariano. These two scholars both had undertaken ambitious Vitruvian projects: the former, a humanist and technician from Verona, attempted to make the text legible and to illustrate it; the latter, a learned Milanese artist, set out to translate, comment, and illustrate De architectura. Yet for Fra Giocondo, the 136 illustrations remained incidental. Although the composition of a page may take into account the relation between text and illustrations, the latter are shown as framed windows that exist apart from the words; they open onto the vanished world of antiquity evoked by the text. The role of the woodcuts presented by Fra Giocondo is analogous to the illustrations of the Hipnerotomachia Poliphili: they are like stage sets on which fragments of a story are played out.

At the top of the page is a fragment of the Preface (2-4), the story of Dinocrates. A barely visible image of Mount Athos has been sketched in pencil in the blank space. The central portion of the page contains Book II, i, 1-6. Below the text, in a perspective setting, are four drawings of the development of the primitive hut. From left to right: upright forked props, pitched roof, and woven walls; a similar building clad with dried clods and with an anthropomorphic facade; free interpretation of the Phryrgian pyramidal inhabitations; and the house of the Colchi, again anthropomorphic, with two eyes and a mouth. At the bottom of the page is a fragment of Book II, iii, 3: where Vitruvius describes, and the compiler sketches, three different kinds of bricks: Lydium, pentadoron, and tetradoron. commentary, clarified the text and the notes, but his woodcuts were often "misplaced" in relation to the text. This is either because they did not always adjoin the words they illustrated, or because they referred to a constructional technique or image unknown to Vitruvius. Many of the illustrations that have no direct relation to the text have a disproportionate role, as in the case of his full-page "orthography" of the cathedral of Milan. It would appear, therefore, that the author of the Ferrara manuscript consulted neither Fra Giocondo's nor Cesariano's work. Nor are the illustrations in the Ferrara manuscript placed in the margins of the text, as they were in Filarete's or many of Francesco di Giorgio's folios, in which they often were reduced to the role of mere marginalia.16 Within the limit of each sheet of paper of the Ferrara manuscript, words and figures do play different roles. In many cases the words were written before the illustrations, and, where the latter are still missing, blank spaces often show traces of pencil or perforations left by ruler and compass. In other cases the illustration was drawn before the text was written, which is either arranged in an orderly fashion at the margin or impinges on the edge of the drawing, or even fills the drawing with words. In a few cases the writing became a pretext for a graphic experiment that went beyond the limits set by Vitruvius's words. Many illustrations have an analytic character, and sometimes the details are roughly sketched or absent: only a few illustrations are intentionally pictorial. Most of them were executed with set-square and compass and finished freehand. The elaborate angle perspectives of ancient temples were certainly executed by a practiced draftsman.17 These cutaway drawings of the temples were placed over paved areas, often surrounded by colonnades. Some drawings are clearly the result of accurate measurements or are copied from surveys, whereas plans and sections of the temples in Greece and Asia Minor were drawn either after models of Roman temples or from imagination. 16. The relation between text and illustration in the several editions of Francesco di Giorgio's Treatises is very complex and deserves attention. Massimo Mussini has recently started this complicated work of confrontation and analysis. M. Mussini, // trattato di Francesco di Giorgio Martini e Leonardo: il c?dice Estense restituito (Parma: Istituto di Storia dell'Arte dell'Universit? di Parma, 1991). See also G. Scaglia, Francesco di Giorgio: Checklist and History of Manuscripts and Drawings (Bethlehem, London and Toronto: Associated University Presses, 1992). 17. The perspective techniques used by the author of the Ferrara manuscript cannot be evaluated correctly in this context. Such techniques, together with some extremely original renderings of interiors, provide very rich material to consider, along with what Wolfgang Lotz has acutely observed in "The Rendering of the Interior in Architectural Drawings of the Renaissance," in Studies in Italian Renaissance Culture (Cambridge, Mass., and London: MIT Press, 1977), pp. 1-65.</page><page sequence="5">Sgarbi: A newly discovered corpus of Vitruvian images 35 o O o: o ?i?, o -*a. o --a* o -&lt;*- o "&lt;* o x? o ?. .o MMM?M 4*f*0pily*Jtt$!*m*E? ****** ?"fflJ* g*?.

The verbal description of the Roman forum (De architectura, Book V, i, 2-4) is here entirely contained within the illustration. Yet the drawing does not follow exactly Vitruvius's prescriptions for the plan of the building (an extra bay is added to the ratio 2:3). A profile of the building is drawn through the plan, interrupting the words on the line where the elevation is described. The manuscript may even have been prepared in an artist's workshop where, perhaps under the supervision of a scholar, several hands worked on the illustrations. Yet the handwriting is consistent, and the graphic plan of each folio seems to belong to that hand. Obviously, Vitruvius's text was the guiding thread of the manuscript, and even where the illustration was drawn first, its approximate location was predetermined. Tendentiously, the writing is placed at the top and the drawing at the bottom. Nevertheless this constitutes a mental predisposition that the author himself was not afraid to challenge. Indeed, the illustrated folios are so w?^"? -~"?1 Figure 3. Biblioteca Ariostea, Fe., Ms. II, 176, fol. 4v, courtesy of the Biblioteca Ariostea, Ferrara. This illustration belongs to De architectura, Book VII, Preface, 12. In a very long introduction, Vitruvius pays homage to those who wrote on architecture before him. He mentions a volume written on the temple of Juno at Samos. For this passage Frank Granger's Vitruvius edition has the Latin text: "de aede i?nica lunonis quae est Sam i Rhoecus et Theodorus." The Ferrara manuscript renders the passage as "de aede lunonis quae est Sami D?rica Theodorus", as in the Harleian manuscript (Frank Granger translates that passage as follows: "Rhoecus and Theodorus [published a work] on the Ionic temple of Juno which is at Samos" [op. cit., vol. 2, p. 71]. The English translation of the same passage in the Ferrara manuscript is this: "Theodorus [published a work] on the Doric temple at Juno which is at Samos."). This rather pictorial illustration of the sacred building and its urban precinct is labeled "Templum lunonis in Samo. D?rico More. Pseudodipteros." Note that the Doric columns are rather slender for canonical proportion. There are five other similar illustrations to the Preface of Book VII. richly and differently composed that every attempt at classification seems reductive.</page><page sequence="6">36 RES 23 SPRING 1993 **f ' VUI lfft*f inA&amp;*tiMf fm&amp;?fit/ M4MHH' ?JLuuS Figure 4. Biblioteca Ariostea, Fe., Ms. II, 176, fol. 31 r, courtesy of the Biblioteca Ariostea, Ferrara. This is one of the most articulate pages of De architectura Book X in the Ferrara manuscript. There is a mistake in the enumeration given by the compiler. This is not chapter viii, but v, 1-2. The illustration and the text constitute a perfect ensemble; what is depicted in fact is a landscape where three different water mills are working simultaneously. The largest machine and its supports, which frame the water mills in the background, probably were drawn last because their contour lines are superimposed on both the writing and the lines of the landscape.</page><page sequence="7">Sgarbi: A newly discovered corpus of Vitruvian images 37 The complex combination of three things?the sheet of paper, the text, and the illustration?emphasizes that they work together as an autonomous unit. Each component shows interplay, tolerance, conflict, or hesitation with respect to the other. Yet they form an organized, memory-assisting apparatus intended to emphasize the sequence of Vitruvius's arguments. When text and illustrations are effectively allied, invention and compatibility interact. The first example of this is the author's attempt to interpret what Vitruvius calls scamilli impares. II. Scamilli impares At the end of the fourth chapter of his third Book, Vitruvius described the stylobate, which is commonly understood to be the platform on which a temple is to be constructed.18 Yet Vitruvius never explained exactly what he meant and even spoke of the stylobate of a temple in the plural. In the fifth paragraph, he complicated matters by introducing the term "podium" as that which is constructed on three sides of a temple and to which the stylobate, situated under the columns, must be "adapted." The reader may therefore conclude that a stylobate lies between each column and the podium. This interpretation was taken over by many Vitruvian commentators before the nineteenth century. Indeed, Vitruvius himself might have misunderstood what he had read or heard about stylobates and podia. For his part Vitruvius was writing about the Roman-Etruscan type of temple with a podium on three sides, whereas the Greek and Hellenistic temple had stylobate-steps on four sides and no proper podium. Many of the interpretations, some very fantastic, of the term scamilli impares are due to this mismatch of intentions. Scamillus is a diminutive of scamnum, a bench or seat; impares can mean "odd" or "uneven." The best translation of the term therefore may be "uneven steps," and this is the case with the temples that have been refined optically. The compiler of the Ferrara manuscript showed the Greek stylobate as a podium, whereas he applied the term "stylobate" to that which is commonly found between the columns and the podium?in other words, the pedestal. He therefore amended scamillos to scabellos by showing this amendment and also by transcribing the original. He illustrated this further, and ame 0000000*00 ?Jim e p-?-?q ?

In De architectura, Book III, iv, 3-5, Vitruvius writes about the stylobate of the temple and its uneven number of steps. Then he describes a temple with a podium on three sides, suggesting the adoption of scamilli impares. The compiler clearly distinguishes the two different kinds of temple bases, but he obviously is intrigued by the adiectio responding to scamilli impares. called the pedestal stilobacta podius. Stilobacta appears in capital letters in the illustration, whereas podius is in italic and seems to have been added as an afterthought so that the adiectio of the scabellos becomes a median entasis of the pedestal equal to one-twenty-fourth of its width (fig. 5). In a later folio, there also is an illustration on a larger scale that shows the entasis of two pedestals (fig. 6). The same entasis reappears in another illustration showing the entire facade of a temple (fig. 7). No structural, compositional, or constructive reasoning could lead to such a modification. Only the word adiectio in the text connects that image with the 18. F. Granger, op. cit., pp. 182-185.

Biblioteca Ariostea, Fe., Ms. Il, 176, fol. 40v, courtesy of the Biblioteca Ariostea, Ferrara. Following the description of the Ionic column base is Vitruvius's explanation of the outer row of columns around the temple: De architectura, Book III, v, 4. These columns should not be set up perpendicularly but slightly tilted inward, so that their diminution is emphasized by the contraction of the whole temple. This incomplete illustration probably was meant to sum up the contents of paragraphs 1-4, but still is representing the pedestals (stylobacta podius) of the columns and their middle increments (Adiectio) equal to one-twenty fourth of the width. entasis of the column. Cesariano considered columnar entasis to be structurally analogous to the swell in the human torso because it represented to him the dilatation of male abdominal muscles when tensed, or the belly of a pregnant woman.19 Much has been written on scamilli impares. In 1980 an attempt was made to demonstrate that the enigmatic Figure 7. Biblioteca Ariostea, Fe., Ms. Il, 176, 58r, courtesy of the Biblioteca Ariostea, Ferrara. De architectura, Book III, v, 13, isdedicated to the optical corrections that Vitruvius suggests for all the members above the capitals of the columns.

This argument is not convincing after a review of three different copies of Fra Giocondo's Vitruvius, and his illustration remains puzzling. The interpretation in the early Italian translation by Fabio Calvo Ravennate seems very close to that of the 19. ". . .

The middle increment is one-tenth of the height or one-eighteenth of the width. (Survey and drawing made by the author.) In Fabio Calvo's translation of Vitruvius, we read: "The stylobate should be leveled or made even, but it should have in the middle uneven stools, because if they were made straight, in plumb, and even, and they were not protruding a bit either up or down, they would look alveolated, that is an order of beehives" (see n. 21). Obviously this is not a description of Villa Madama's pedestals, but the allusion to "uneven stools" that are protruding and out of plumb might lead to such an interpretation. commentary (fig. 8) is also analogous to Fabio Calvo's thinking. The curiously potbellied pedestals of the facade columns of Villa Madama were perhaps a modern realization of such an interpretation (fig. 9); however, Raphael's deformations of pedestals have very little to do with the refinements shown in the Ferrara manuscript. The decision to make the entasis one-twenty-fourth of the width of the pedestal seems to have been made arbitrarily by the author of the Ferrara manuscript. It 21. V. Fontana and P. Morachiello, op. cit., p. 159. My English translation of that passage?caption to figure 8?sounds as odd as the Italian one by Fabio Calvo Ravennate: "La stilobata cos? bisogna che sia equata overo equalmente facta, ma abbia per? per mezo scabelletti dispari, perch? se fossero facti diritti a filo e pari, e non uscissero niente in fora o di sopra o di socto, pareria un alveolato cio? uno ordine di buzzi d'api." This should be related with Pier Nicola Pagliara's observations concerning the "Fregio pulvinato" (P. N. Pagliara, op. cit. p. 44). See also H. Burns, "Raffaello e 'quell'antiqua architectura,'" in Frommel, Ray, Tafuri, Raffaello Architetto?Sezione Rafaello el'antico (Milan, 1984), pp. 394-396. 22.

Why he chose such a small unit and not a larger one, as Raphael or as Bernardino Baldi later did, is also puzzling. The very obscurity of the text became a stimulus to figurative invention in such a case where deformation and interpretation were closely linked. III. Homo bene figuratus The second paradigmatic example relates to the famous passage in Vitruvius on body proportions (III, i, 1-7). The obverse and reverse of folio 78 (figs. 10, 11) contain the first seven paragraphs of the first chapter of Book III, in which Vitruvius considered the composition of aecfes and sacrae aedes in relation to the human body. Both aecfes and sacrae aedes are commonly translated as "temples," although aedes does not always refer to sacred buildings. Vitruvius used sacra aedes to signify "temple," whereas aedificium signifies any private or public building. Aedes alone therefore might signify something between sacra aedes and aedificium.23 The change of tone in Vitruvius's words between the first ("Aedium compositio constat. . . ," III, i, 1) and the third paragraphs ("Similiter vero sacrarum aedium . . . ," III, i, 3) is noticeable. Although similiter vero is taken to mean "indeed," rather than "similarly," there still appears to be an actual shift in Vitruvius's argument. The compiler of the Ferrara manuscript not only realized the changes in meaning but also provided rather different interpretations. On the verso of the folio, he transcribed the first two paragraphs: "Aedem compositio constat. . . infinitas laudes sunt adsecuti." On the recto, the third paragraph begins: "Similiter vero sacrarum aedium . . . ," and the transcription continues until the end of paragraph seven. This demarcation was not taken seriously into consideration by other commentators. The compiler of the Ferrara manuscript seems to have understood that in the first two paragraphs the subject is aedes, whereas from the third paragraph on, the subject is sacrae aedes, which he could have interpreted respectively as "secular building" and "sacred building." The handwriting of this section is on both sides of the sheet of paper and is barely contained within its allotted margins; it progressively encroaches on the illustrations for the purpose of economizing space. On the verso, written words take up the entire margin between the edges of the paper and the figure, like a frame. The verso illustration clearly was drawn before the text was written, whereas the recto illustration .- ? .. /'*, ]&gt;J . ! :.i?| .. ;. ' ' /! ) " Figure 10. Biblioteca Ariostea, Fe., Ms. Il, 176, fol. 78r, courtesy of the Biblioteca Ariostea, Ferrara. The compiler correctly indicates this portion of the text as Book III, i. It contains paragraphs 1-3, where Vitruvius explains that the composition of aedes depends on symmetry that arises from proportion (Greek analog?a), which, in turn, consists of a dignified ratio between all the members of the work. This ratio can be revealed in the body hominis bene figurad. In the drawing the compiler adds a few details to Vitruvius's descriptions of the body proportions. The side view of the body on the right is roughly sketched with pencil but contains numerical notations in ink under the man's feet. might have been drawn at the same time as or, because it is incomplete, after the text. The illustrations of this passage have the nature of a two-sided jigsaw puzzle: the recto illustration is not complete because there are pencil traces of a human profile in the right margin (fig. 10). In the center there is a body in movement, in an inflected position 23. Cabellat, Bouet, Fleury, Zuinghedau, Vitruve. De architectura.

Vitruvius describes the man in the circle and in the square as a paradigm for the complete correspondence of the members of sacra aedes. There is an omission in the text at the end of the third paragraph: ". . . relata fuerit ad manus pansas, invenietur eadem latitudo uti altitudo, quemadmodum . . ." ("once applied to the outstretched hands, then the breadth will be equal to the height, similarly"). Probably the author considered these words unnecessary repetitions in relation to his understanding of Vitruvius's text. In fact, he does not envisage any change in the position of the man's feet and hands. Nevertheless, because of this omission, the Latin prose is awkward. He also might have left out those words, being distracted by the wish to have both text and illustration fit onto one sheet of paper.</page><page sequence="12">42 RES 23 SPRING 1993 LIBER y raentin relata fuent ad bmoui piWmo?ctur ea/ TERTIVS. 22 EfgottaMtBCtomfwJiirconwhijwhii.Tti ptopoi?oaibq? room/ UiM\immmm^mMiimmnkmu?[m^twi mmrrrfirrwlhmifltii iiyinrfiw%Trnfr**'~l--L^ -f*-a'""' .'ff"-^ iiw?aii mil i !* i wil??i iim?miimIm?mi ?\ Iflniili ?ii iwn In i pit bwcfenab^C taira ??feleKptfMKT^N?: mm? maun/ lt^M?^iiM?om?iboH^?&lt;^wh?Mtiii^&gt;iM&lt;feyn[cofpo/ Na&gt; n? pottda uJUfine fytnmcma at&lt;j fpom?e r6oemhabm topofi/ nonii^u?uoadho?bcnefiguratimebro*habaeme*a?i'iwia&amp;&gt; Cor/ pusjtho? *a natura o?oofuit, ro o% aptfu a memo ad front* furomi &amp; radias nus captfli dk dedn? p*m,lt? mama palma ab aracuto ad ex/ crow? medj? ?gn? t?t?df Ap*H a meneo ad toumi rerat? o?au*,Tituiv demabcmiiab'inm,AbEtn?ptt?kreidtmair?^ lutn? uerac? quanajptu* a?t ora akaudinii torta ptn dt ab uno memo ca fine ad wm radtm capJli.vbi frot? e?c/,itcm tenor pumita uero aJ tmadma corpom fcxtr, Cut?tu? tpun?, Pe?ui Kan e?tt*,RelKpia&lt;juo&lt;| rocnabra?uoilubemc?inenfujpfoportwto^ rejAtbtQanjoobUau?BUgim&amp;tofcutajlMkia?untaflccun.SimiW uero Urrax? ?d? mebn ad unjua?m toa? magrufudmu fi?ml ci pam/ b^fagulga^irnthi?fimi1d&lt;^hfiTC?n?ilj?rt?p??tim^cocpa&lt;^^ t^edj?aaflji^itcrcuumbUxio/Ui^fehQcoi'ocjtmfiKmC?pm?iinMa bu* ? pedibos pjo?s cuom^ cotlocx? cfa?jo Tint&gt;dieoeni?,arabgtn dorotuodaoooemucraruP9maminm &amp; pcdum&lt;bgm hnca taoffeocm |4cm?*ttqQaBadinoc!?im^ UBEK.

The visual interpretation of the Vitruvian man as seen by (top left and right) Fra Giocondo (M. Vitruvius per Jocundum s?lito castigador factus, cum figuris et tabula . . . loannis de Tridino, Venezia, 1511) and (bottom left and right) Cesare Cesariano (Di Lucio Vitruvio Pollione De Architectura Libri Dece traducti de latino in vulg?re affigurati . . . Gotardo da Ponte, Como, 1521). In both cases the man in the square and the man in the circle seem to be two different persons with different characters. (Reproductions from the copies owned by the Biblioteca Estense-Modena.) resembling an athlete in contrapposto or the Belvedere's Apollo. The left foot is raised, and the right arm is extended but slightly curved along the flank; the left arm is raised, bringing the hand to shoulder height. The man's head is turned, and he is looking at his hand (which Vitruvius saw as a primary measuring tool) with an expression that can be read as one of surprise. Superimposed on the entire figure are a number of stylized compasses open at different widths that designate parts of the body. These dimensions are marked along four straight lines, corresponding to four modules that are situated to the left of the body. The verso illustration may be complete (fig. 11). It depicts a body in a symmetrical position, the legs joined and the arms spread and slightly raised halfway between the two positions taken by the arms in Leonardo da Vinci's famous drawing. The face is not given any expression, and the eyes are closed. The man wears a transparent loincloth. Circumscribing the extremities of this figure are a circle and a square. The man's index fingers touch the points where the square intersects the circle. From these points two radii converge on the navel to form segments; a third radius, from the navel to the heels, divides the circle into three equal parts. Traces of a similar figure that is double the size are still visible on the page; this larger sketched figure is obscured by superimposed writing, white paint, and partial erasure. The circle that inscribes the larger lost figure takes up the whole page and its center is the hair roots of the smaller cruciform man. It is possible that while the compiler digested the first paragraphs of Book III, two complementary but polarized ?mages formed in his mind: one of a moving, living man, with an erect penis, and the other of a man with his eyes closed, possibly dead, crucified and fixed in tripartite perfection. One wonders which illustration depicts the man bene figuratus: the physically good looking man who governs the laws of composition of the aecfes, or the morally well-formed man, who presides over the sacrae aecfes?the only one worthy to Figure 13. A reconstruction by the author after Leonardo da Vinci's Vitruvian man. The original drawing (Leonardo da Vinci, Study of Human Proportions in the Manner of Vitruvius. Venice, Gallerie dell'Accademia, n. 228) was executed around 1490 (twenty years after Francesco di Giorgio's rather imprecise sketch). Leonardo followed very closely Vitruvius's vertical subdivision of the human body into ten, eight, six, and four portions. The circle has its center in the navel, which is located approximately between 3/8 and 4/10. It is not possible to fix the center of the arc described by the movement of the arms. be a model for other men?24 Both bene and figuratus have double meanings that refer to physical and moral qualities. After indicating the relations among the different parts of the human body, Vitruvius provided a description of the figure of the man in the circle, adding that the same man can also be inscribed in a square. He referred to the movements of the limbs of a human body lying supine (supinus). The feet and the hands play a major role in the delineation of these figures because the trunk of the body is supposed to maintain a stable position. Nevertheless, Vitruvius did not specify to where the limbs should be stretched: he 24. Homo bene fi gu raw s was rendered, in a French medieval translation, as ''homme de bonne taille." "Et sachie's premi?rement que tout aussi comme tous li mondes est reons, tout aussi homs de bonne taille est rons. Et tout autant doit avoir homs de bonne taille de toise ?n extendue de ses bras comme de long en son estant pour faire droite rondesche." See C. A. Thommaset, ed., Timeo and Placide (Geneva: Librarie Droz, 1980), p. 93.</page><page sequence="14">44 RES 23 SPRING 1993 suggesting the possible squaring of the circle, and playing a role similar to the movement of the limbs in Leonardo's man. In the Ferrara manuscript the attributes of the figure are those of a crucifixion, yet the extremities are not those of a crucified man: the hands are open and rested, and the feet are standing and symmetrical, and not overlapped. They are not the extremities of a corpse. But what is to be understood of details such as the closed eyes or the loincloth around the pelvis? They are typical features of a crucified body and they must be significant, especially because another detail?the hair?is "still" missing. "Still" is in quotation marks because had the hair been drawn in, it would have obscured the alignment of the head. This indicates that the figure is both schematic in fact and very precisely drawn in intention. Sources for such syncretism might have been medieval iconographies of man as a microcosm. The famous thirteenth-century illustration from the liber Divinorum Operum of Hildegard von Bingen preserved in Lucca demonstrates the fusion of Christian iconographie sources (God embracing the spheres in Byzantine illustrations of Genesis, and Adam the First Man, surrounded by the winds) with ancient astrological doctrines (the rays of the seven planets touch the head and the feet of the figure and connect the winds with the stars).26 The First Man whom Hildegard described is at the mercy of conflicts and cosmological forces that quarrel over him, as is Adam, who protects his head from the rain with his hands: the tiny figure envisaged by Filarete as the archetypal builder.27 Adam covers his genitals? the center of his body?with his hands: he is already stained by sin. In the illustration of Guido Bonatti's Introductorium (fourteenth century), he is the hub of the Wheel of Fortune and the target of astral influences. In fifteenth-century-manuscript illustrations, his body became dismembered in a vortex, or seemed to lose its strength.28 The drawing of the man in the square and the circle executed by Taccola in 1433 is connected simply said that they should be spread apart, or extended (pansas). In most of the known illustrations, the center of the two figures shifts, moving from the navel of the man in the circle to the genitals (although Vitruvius did not mention them) of the man in the square. In Fra Giocondo's illustrations, the two images remain separate (fig. 12, top left and right). In Leonardo's illustration, the two images are merged for the first time (fig. 13). In fact, Leonardo went far beyond simple superimposition: he described at least four different combinations of leg and arm positions: (1) spread legs/raised spread arms, (2) joined legs/lowered spread arms, (3) joined legs/raised spread arms, and (4) spread legs/lowered spread arms. The illustrator of the Ferrara manuscript did not show a man with spread legs. Instead the two positions shown by Leonardo and Fra Giocondo (ad quadratum and ad circulum) become perfectly homologous, given the posture seen in the Ferrara manuscript. Two centers (the genitals and the navel) can be found without moving any member of the body hominis bene figurad: this would not have been possible in Leonardo's drawing, because his man would have had to move both arms and legs in order to shift from the square to the circle. Cesare Cesariano's illustrations do not overlap the two figures, yet they are more difficult to describe. The posture of the man in the square is Apollonian (fig. 12, bottom left): every portion of the body becomes part of a stable order. Even the hairstyle contributes to the figure's dignified carriage. However, the man in the circle is Dionysiac to the extent that his hands and feet seem oversized, and his hair resembles vine leaves (fig. 12, bottom right). In fact, there is a possible reference to his erect penis in the commentary: ". . . as you can see in this figure given as example by Pier Paolo Segazone. . . ." This remark could be a combination of priapic humor and mythical wisdom.25 At any rate one should consider the erection as a shift between the two centers of the body?from the genitals to the navel? 25. ". . . Si como vedi per questa figura exemplata da Pier Paolo Segazone. ..." Cesare Cesariano, op. cit., fol. XLIX v. The Italian slang uses sega to indicate male masturbation. Segazone might mean "the great masturbator." This interpretation is probably the result of a perverse imagination, but information about the nobleman Segazone and the role he might have had in the drawing of the Vitruvian figure is missing. The family name Segazone is recorded in the archives of the city of Milan, but no accurate research has yet been done. Hans Karl L?cke, in his excellent essay on Cesariano's Vitruvian man, said nothing relevant about Pier Paolo Segazone. See H. K.

Yet For. . . [Leonardo] . . . there existed no magical descent of animated celestial bodies on the living human organism?not even in the diagrammatical manner of earlier representations. If he calls the body subordinate to the sky he adds, like Pico della Mir?ndola, that the sky is subordinate to the mind.31 Christianizing Vitruvius's man, the Ferrara manuscript mediates between medieval and Renaissance tendencies. The executor of the drawing knew he could not simply borrow the medieval Everyman: a fragile body of a man around whom a wheel of fortune revolves. This draftsman also knew that he could not rely on the proportionality of the human figure in its infinite modification?an ?deal man derived from empirical measurements.32 The 'squared man' in relation to anything that implies or recalls the number four, is the perfect man. Yet from a medieval perspective, the perfect man is Christ. The man whose arms and legs truly stretch to the four corners of the universe is the divine Crucified Man. He is the realization of total harmony and the epitome of the universe. He rules the world with the four evangelists and also symbolizes the tetrachord and the teleion.33 ^^IBB'iolNF'^ ' ?m- \ "~il~&gt;?^ r~*"~??J L k? * ? m Figure 14. An attempt to reconstruct the geometrical composition underlying Masaccio's Trinity (1428) in Santa Maria Novella (Florence). Among the many coincidences, notice that the circumference of the circle centered on Christ's navel touches God's mouth (the Verbum). In turn, the center of the higher circle (God's head-top) is aligned with the architectural composition; its circumference touches Christ's breast, which corresponds to the fourth part of the square. (Drawing made by the author.) The image of the crucified Christ usually does not follow set geometrical patterns. Often the hands are contracted, the head inclined, the body twisted, and the legs flexed. The center of the figure falls halfway between the genitals and the navel. The crucified body is not a corpse, but is halfway between life and death. It is clear that all these changes on the position of key parts of the body correspond to a complex iconological 29.

Leonardo's Vitruvian man is the result of long research and experimentation in the everyday world: ". . . adunque piglia un orno di 3 braccia e quello misura colla regola ch'io ti daro'; se tu mi dicessi, io potrei ingannare, giudicando uno bene proporzionato che sarebbe il contrario, a queste parole io rispondo ehe tu debi vedere molti omini di 3 braccia . . . ."

In a Greek manuscript of the fifteenth century copied from a Syrian model, the first man in the circle is Hercules, who is neither a mortal, nor a god, but a hero: an intermediate being. The "relations between the greater and the lesser worlds could be symbolically demonstrated in the likeness of that semi-human hero who had been raised to the sky." 33.

Semitransparent ?mage of the two sides (recto and verso) of the sheet of paper (courtesy of the Biblioteca Ariostea, Ferrara). It reveals that the illustration made on one side was used to proportion the ?mage of the body on the other side. The athlete in contrapposto probably was drawn first; the large figure of the body ?n the square and in the circle followed. The latter then was covered with white and redrawn half-scale. The distance between the chin and the root of the hair in the smaller figure, and the distance between the genitals and the navel in the larger one, are the same. Moreover, this being the dimension of the hand (from wrist to finger tip) and the tenth part of the body's height, it also applies to both single illustrations. map. The shift between the two centers of Christ's body corresponds to the shift between his two natures. This symbolic geometrical composition is manifested in Masaccio's Trinity (fig. 14). It shows, as do many other Renaissance crucifixions, how deeply linked Vitruvius's homo bene figuratus and Christ's sacrifice could be. In the Ferrara manuscript, the lack of expressive traits suggests a Vitruvian man resigned to the fate of crucifixion. The body of Christ could be read either as supinus (the cross lying on the ground) or as standing (as in Beato Angelico's painting at Saint Marco).34 The body on the verso of the Ferrara manuscript is not like any other known Vitruvian man. The ideal body for the sacrae aedes is not inflexed and live, as is that which Francesco di Giorgio sketched.35 It is not a man distinguished by his beauty, not merely a good-looking body, but the body on which a sacred building can be solidly founded. Simultaneously examining the two sides of the semitransparent sheet of paper through the light (fig. 15), one sees that although the illustration drawn on one side was used as a reference for drawing on the other side, changes were made. The posture of the man's body and his apparent composure on the verso were not determined merely by the confines of the square and the circle; his features suggest much more. The conceptual distance between the two bodies must be seen in the thickness of that semitransparent and perforated sheet of paper. The two images cannot be separated (they are on the same sheet of paper and they are based on the same proportions), yet they do not mirror each other directly: the man who is full of vitality on the recto is ready to be crucified on the verso. In this instance the "constant metaphoric chain" between body and building cannot be taken for granted.36 The shift between the two sides of that sheet 34. Beato Ang?lico, in a fresco in San Marco's Convent (cell n. 36), paints Jesus Christ in the process of being nailed to the cross. This crucifixion, instead of taking place while Christ is supine, is undertaken with the help of ladders, one of which holds his body up. The inflected position of the body recalls the Vitruvian man sketched by Francesco di Giorgio (see n. 35 below). I point this out mainly because it is important to note that none of the illustrators I mentioned depicted the Vitruvian man as being supinus, that is, lying face upward, flat on his back.

Two kinds of buildings compelled the compiler of the Ferrara manuscript to look for two different kinds of bodies. IV. Attributions There are many possible candidates for authorship, or co-authorship, of the Ferrara manuscript. A number of scholars (some famous, others obscure) wrote about Vitruvius during the fifteenth century. Because the manuscript was donated to the Biblioteca Ariostea as the work of a Ferrarese author, its possible role at the court of the Este at the end of the fifteenth century should be considered. Pellegrino Prisciani of Ferrara undoubtedly was a key figure in this circle, although the calligraphic comparisons between his manuscripts and the Vitruvian one do not sufficiently prove that it was written by him. Interest in the text of Vitruvius at the court of Ferrara was first recorded when Leonel lo d'Est? asked Leon Battista Alberti to provide a commentary on the Ten Books, or a revised version. Ferrarese interest in Vitruvius continued for years; it is likely that Cesare Cesariano began his own vernacular translation of Vitruvius in Ferrara, helped by the lectors of the Studio. One anecdote will be useful in assessing the role of the Ten Books at the Este court: when Cesariano arrived at Ferrara in about 1499, he witnessed an experiment that attempted to demonstrate the Ptolemaic movement of the planets. The seven celestial orbits were represented by the paths made by seven ants imprisoned within the grooves of seven concentric discs. This same conceit is described almost verbatim in Book IX (ch. I, 15ff.) of Vitruvius.37 Pellegrino Prisciani,38 while presenting his own work on the reform of the calendar to the pope, compared himself to the legendary architect Dinocrates. Following Vitruvius, Prisciani said that he was not as beautiful as Dinocrates. Moreover, he was not an architect but a scholar who passed his time in the libraries and archives of Italy reading and transcribing texts. He described himself as a gardener who filled his pots with highly scented flowers for good readers to sniff. Prisciani occupied various offices at the Este court: librarian, archivist, lector of the Studio, astrologer, historian, and also ambassador of the Duke of Ferrara at Venice, Milan, and Rome. As a learned astrologer (Aby Warburg considered Prisciani the probable author of the iconographie program for the frescoes of the Schifanoia Palace),39 he certainly must have studied parts of Vitruvius's treatise in detail. As a librarian, he was surely acquainted with the only extant treatise on antique architecture. Furthermore, Prisciani was the intermediary between the duke and the architect Biagio Rossetti, who was working on the Herculean addition of Ferrara, one of the most famous planning achievements of the Renaissance.40 Both Prisciani and the Este court were interested in the text of Vitruvius, and illustrations taken from the treatise certainly existed. In a letter from Isabella d'Est? to her husband, Francesco Gonzaga, dated 13 September 1491, she stated that Prisciani contributed greatly to her knowledge of (Vitruvian) architecture by showing her certain drawings.41 Yet there is more than intellectual curiosity in Prisciani's dealing with the text of Vitruvius. Vitruvius is cited in Prisciani's treatise Spectacula as an authority on (or at least a guide to) the reconstruction of the ancient classical theater. Spectacula was written between 1486 and 1502 at the 37. Paola Zambelli, "Astrologia e Magia," in G. Chittolini, scientific coordinator, Le sedi della cultura nell'Emilia Romagna.

Spectacula is also the only treatise of the late 1400s to deal exclusively with the theater. It is not a theoretical exercise but has an immediate and practical aim, because the duke planned to reform the theater and to construct a permanent building for performances. By this time, in fact, the Italian ruling class understood the social function of such a public building, but a design for one had yet to be made. For Prisciani, Vitruvius was a capitano in the reconstruction of the Roman theater. Yet he expanded and corrected the dicta of Vitruvius as a result of direct archaeological observations. Prisciani often made use of illustrations in his writings. He stated repeatedly the importance of such aids in the understanding of the written word, although the images he drew are quite naive when compared with those in the Ferrara manuscript. Prisciani had been in contact with Giorgio Valla to obtain precious manuscripts for the Este library. In a letter to Ercole I written from Venice (9 July 1492), Prisciani related that he had asked for the De sphaera and De cylindro of Archimedes from Valla on behalf of the duke.42 These could not be borrowed, because they were bound together with other works, so Prisciani undertook the task of recopying them. At about the same time, Giorgio Valla declared that he had been at work on what must have been an illustrated commentary of the Ten Books of Vitruvius. In a letter to Jacopo Antiquario (Venice, 19 July 1492) he wrote that De architectura had been newly "enlighted" by being illustrated with "mathematical figures," and he boasted that neither in Rome nor elsewhere had a similar undertaking been attempted.43 Giorgio Valla's interest in Vitruvius may have been marginal. Perhaps the "mathematical figures" are only those to which Vitruvius refers in the text and which were never reproduced in the copies or never carried out in the original. This would be of slight importance without the complex iconographie apparatus of the Ferrara manuscript. Yet Giorgio Valla?known as the author of forty-nine books of a large encyclopedia of Latin and Greek culture (De expetendis et fugiendis rebus)44?also had the qualifications to undertake a difficult work as shown in the Ferrara Manuscript. In 1492 he gave a course of lectures on Vitruvius in Venice. In another letter to Jacopo Antiquario (8 August 1492), he wrote that he had begun the commentary on the eighth Book and had worked with some of his apprentices even on public holidays. He also suggested publishing an interpretation of the text of Vitruvius.45 The attribution to either Prisciani or Valla is not definitive. Neither could have executed the illustrations that accompany the text without the help of a skillful and gifted artist or an atelier. An important group of humanists and artists in Rome was working on De architectura at that time. In a copy of a lost letter, seen by many scholars as falso antico, which Raphael is alleged to have written to Fabio Calvo Ravennate (15 August 1514), he is made to say the following: When I will have time, and because of my occupations I am afraid it will not be as early as I wish, I will draw for you the figures in the white spaces and I will prepare a doric frontispiece with an arch and the ?mages of the virtues inside and many other inventions which grow out of my fantasy.46 Some drawings, surprisingly similar to those of the Ferrara manuscript, were bound with the first Italian translation of Vitruvius's treatise by Fabio Calvo, which was made under Raphael's direction; however, the paper's watermarks and the handwriting are different, and they were annotated in Italian, not in Latin. The drawings in the Ferrara manuscript certainly are not in Raphael's hand. But a workshop of people, committed to a rigorous study of ancient Rome, did develop around Raphael and Fra Giocondo when they were both occupied with the construction of Saint Peter's. What already has been suggested about the interpretation of the scamilli impares in the Italian translation of Fabio Calvo and, at the same time, in the 42. G.

Baldassarre Peruzzi, Raphael's good friend, worked on Vitruvius's Ten Books. As Vasari wrote, Peruzzi started a book on ancient Rome and a commentary on Vitruvius, making progressively the drawings of the figures upon the writings of that author, adding that some of those drawings were kept in Francesco da Siena's house.47 The "drawings of the figures upon the writings" can signify the practice of inserting illustrations in the available spaces within the text as well as that of commenting on the text with illustrations on separate sheets. Vasari wrote also that works of Baldassarre Peruzzi were left to the architect Jacopo Meleghino Ferrarese. Peruzzi's hand, however, is very different from that of the illustrator of the Ferrara manuscript, both in graphic style and in composition. The Ferrarese author might have been able to copy hypothetical Peruzzi drawings; nevertheless, because none of those published prove to be in any way analogous to those of the Ferrara manuscript,48 the hypothetical Peruzzi drawings probably were lost. In fact, the very accurate section of the Pantheon executed by Peruzzi (now in the Biblioteca Ariostea) was not used in the Ferrara manuscript.49 Information on Jacopo Meleghino Ferrarese is very sparse. It is known that he worked in Rome, that he was consulted by Guillaume Philander,50 and that he belonged to a group of architects and artists who founded the "Congregazione dei Virtuosi al Pantheon" in 1542?so called because the members of the group displayed their works inside the atrium of the Pantheon. The Congregazione had Antonio da Sangallo il Giovane as its first president. A program survives from the Congregazione, whose formation preceded that of the Accademia Vitruviana by a few years. In an introduction written by Sangallo in 1539, the goals of the Congregazione were outlined as being the long and patient task of re-editing and re illustrating Vitruvius's text. The seven motives listed by Sangallo to undertake such a difficult work (which was never carried out) could explain the intent of the Ferrara manuscript.51 It therefore is reasonable to suppose that hypothetical writings and drawings by Baldassarre Peruzzi, remaining in the hands of Jacopo Meleghino, could have been used as models for the illustrations of the Ferrara manuscript. Being in Rome, in the house of a Ferrarese architect, the Ferrara manuscript was to be included in the collection of the Riminaldi family. But in this case the dating would advance by several years, and would conflict with both the calligraphic examination and the originality of the drawings. Neither Peruzzi nor Raphael knew Latin well. This rules out their participation in the drafting of the Ferrara manuscript. As has been said above, the link between the text and the illustrations is such that one cannot assume that they were the result of two distinct operations. The writer knew Latin well enough to correct a text that probably had already been emended in the first printed editions. Even if he could not draw, he certainly understood the text well enough to provide information about the delineation of many figures. He noted points of reference, as well as names of parts of the building, of the body, or of the machine, to be represented in the spaces that he left blank. The Ferrara manuscript can be included within a historical tradition, and yet its content cannot be assimilated to any known Vitruvian manuscripts. The importance of the Ferrara manuscript is not limited to its originality, as the first attempt of restitutio figuralis of Vitruvius's Ten Books. Because the work was interrupted and revised as a draft copy, it reveals the intentions, decisions, editorial techniques, reflections, doubts, and uncertainties that are part of a program of great cultural importance: the translation of a verbal heritage into a visual one. 47.
