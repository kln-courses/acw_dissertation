An important part of understanding the process of this change is understanding the development of social complexity during the transition. This study addresses this question by examining variations in burial rite coinciding with the age or sex of the deceased or the spatial distribution of 106 graves from the Lengyel Culture settlement in Svodín, dated around 4800 cal BC. The concept of exceptionality rather than richness of burials is introduced. It is based on the composition and spatial distribution of inventories within graves and contrary to the traditional deductive approach does not depend on prior selection of attributes of prestige. Principal Component Analysis is used to assess exceptionality based on ceramic shapes, decoration and non-ceramic grave goods. Resampling tests using a Monte Carlo algorithm are employed to assess the significance of connection of specific attributes with exceptional burials and age, sex or spatial groups. This approach enables us to study social differences in regions and time periods where prestigious materials such as metal are not yet present. New conclusions are drawn about social stratification in the Post-LBK era and confronted with results of existing studies dealing with status and prestige. The image of a vertically differentiated society with middle aged men assuming the highest rank in the community emerges, showing complex social relations both between and within different kinships on the settlement. Observations of diachronic development of social differences indicate a gradually evolving society, foreshadowing the emergence of elites in the following Aeneolithic period.

With persons of exceptional status, be After the initial spread of farming communities it acquired or ascribed, we can expect a burial rite which throughout Central Europe during the late sixth and early is significantly differing from the average in terms of fifth millennium cal BC, characterized in the richness and variability of the inventory.

Němejcová-Pavúková in the years 1971–1983 (1986b, 1995) is one of the few Post-LBK sites with preserved housing, burial and ritual structures, all dating to the first stage of the Lengyel Culture (around 4800 cal BC). The remains of 35–40 houses, two circular ditch enclosures, 113 graves and hundreds of pits have been unearthed, providing a substantial amount of archaeological data which can be used for a quantitative analysis of the material cultural expression of a Neolithic community. Settlement burials are a typical phenomenon of the Post-LBK period. In Svodín, the graves are distributed around housing structures, forming seven distinct spatial groups (Figure 2) and seem to be contemporary with the settlement (Demján 2012: 91). Anthropological analysis of the 115 individuals in 113 FIGURE 1.

The most represented age group is Infans II with exceptionality of the burial. Several previous studies 24 individuals.

The concept of a social index (Sozialindex) was adapted Overall, the age and sex distribution shows no distinct from sociology (Müller 1994, Rebay 2006). It reflects bias towards a particular age or sex group, regarding that the standing of the deceased on the social ladder and is it represents an early agrarian community where a high well suited for assessing vertical social differentiation. child mortality and an increased mortality of juvenile and The Sozialindex has several components which are young adult females can be expected (Figure 3). weighed differently based on the author’s consideration and combined to create a summary index. Assigning weights to different materials, quantities, volumes or types of grave offerings is a key element of this approach, requiring prior knowledge of their value to the examined society. Results of statistical analysis, such as plurality or rarity of certain grave goods within the whole assemblage are also considered in the computation of the final index.  While the Sozialindex is well suited for analysing cemeteries from the later prehistory, where we can assume a greater social importance of certain rare materials and funerary monuments which clearly reflect an elevated standing of the interred, there is a considerable potential for bias in the arbitrary assigning FIGURE 3.

For datasets where the theoretical distribution is difficult to assess and the sample size is too small for direct statistical inference, resampling methods such as bootstrapping provide means to estimate significance of observed structures (Efron 1979, Sosna et al. 2008). This method was used to compare the observed average value of the Exceptionality Index (EI) within a specific social group with an interval of values the EI would assume if exceptional burials were distributed randomly between all social groups. A similar method was used to assess the significance of correlation between specific burial attributes and social or spatial groups within the settlement. FIGURE 4.
