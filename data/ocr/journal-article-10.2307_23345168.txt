<plain_text><page sequence="1">"ONE SLASH OF LIGHT, THEN GONE" ANIMALS AS MOVEMENT Henry Buller The title for this paper comes from a poem by Ruth Padel [2004] called "Tiger Drinking at Forest Pool". In it Ruth Padel speaks of the animal as "flirting between the worlds of lost and found". The animal lies "just beyond" any purely scientific or phenomenological understanding, any hard and fast "object" or "subject", that "between" opens the door to imagination, to otherness, to myth and a multitude of différent ways of knowing. It is reminiscent of Michel Serres' "bruit de fond" [1982] and Heidegger's "Zwischen" [1989]. More importantly, it reveáis the animal as embodying movement, of moving away as well as towards ("flirt ing") or going somewhere eise, beyond our framing into some physical but perhaps also meta-physical "other" place. But "flirting" also suggests something teasing and some thing playful in that movement, something that both enchants and provokes an emotional response. Flirting is, after ail, for attracting interest and this, above ail, is what animais do. As Lévi-Strauss once famously remarked, they are "good to think with". Animais move in and out of the (human) frame. They both define it and exceed it. One is reminded here also of John Berger's famous essay in which he writes: Animais came from over the horizon, they belonged there and here [1980: 4], Moving and being are one. As Georges Perec wrote: To live is to pass from one space to another [1974: 6]. In a recent video clip, taken at the Kruger National Park in South Africa and posted on the internet, a crocodile emerges from a lily covered pool to seize a young éléphant by the trunk. The éléphant struggles to prevent itself being dragged into the water by pushing its legs out before it, shifting its centre of gravity and arching its back. A second video clip, also posted on the internet, shows a gorilla running on its hind legs in the rain. As he runs, he lifts his hands over his head to pro tect himself from the falling raindrops. Both of these gestures are, in many ways, highly familiar to many human beings too. In these embodied responses and in these shared movements, there is the potential for commu nication and understanding that arguably crosses and henee challenges more founda tional barriers of différence and dénomina tion. As humans, we might not share verbal language with non human animais but through our bodies and the movement of our bodies, we do partage, as Darwin pointed out many years ago [1899], worldly forms of expres sion, emotion, response and, thereby récogni tion that can both facilitate cross-species étudei ruralei, janvier-juin 2012, 18g : 139-154</page><page sequence="2">Henry Buller knowledge and critically, provide the basis for a différent ethical engagement born of a shared corporeal and fleshy communality. Philosophical engagement with the non human has been predominantly autobiographical, the animal acting as foil to human exception alism and witness to our ontological distinc tiveness. Recent years have seen a "post human" embrace of the non-human; not as a rejection of the human but rather as part of what has been a continuai act of de-centring. Drawing largely upon the twin theoretical hér itages of, on the one hand, "the metaphysics of subjectivity" (from Heidegger to Deleuze and beyond) and, on the other, "the nature culture hybridity" of science studies (from Bruno Latour and beyond), this has both considerably raised the profile and legitimacy of non-human accountings and encouraged us to find ways to, in Giorgio Agamben's words "smash the anthropological machine" [2004]. Nevertheless, a good deal of this post-human, or more-than-human, endeavour retains its conceptual and theoretical attachment to what is essentially philosophical and conceptual positioning in which the animal remains only "good to think with". Even Derrida, whose work underscores so much of contemporary human-animal studies, was not curious enough for Donna Haraway: Why did Derrida not ask, even in prin cipie, if a Gregory Bateson or Jane Goodall or Mark Bekoff or Barbara Smuts or many others have met the gaze of living, diverse animais and in response undone and redone themselves and their sciences? [2008: 21] Arguably, what is needed are new, or dif férent, ways of knowing; "positive knowl edge" as Donna Haraway calis it [2008]. Cary Wolfe in his argument for a refocusing of the post-humanist agenda argues that the princi pal challenge is one of epistemology: [It] forces us to rethink our taken-for granted modes of human experience, including the normal perceptual models and affective states of Homo sapiens itself, by recontextualising them in terms of the entire sensorium of other living beings and their own autopoietic ways of "bringing forth a world" ways that are, since we ourselves are human ani mais, part of the evolutionary history and behavioural and psychological reper toire of the human itself [2010: xxv]. Wolfe's call for a broader sensorium of affective engagement with the non-human animal articulâtes well with current social sci ence interest in moving beyond the primacy of (uniquely human) language, words and représentations as the sole vectors of commu nication, understanding and knowing [ibid.], At a wider scale, the shift to a more-than human(ism) accompanies an associated shift from "meaning" to "affect" and from "dis course" to "practice" [Whatmore 2006: 603 604], In this "counter-linguistic turn" [Weil 2006], other forms of subjectivity are poten tially revealed not through rational thought but through corporeal, haptic and sensory per formance. In her perceptive paper, Simone Weil draws in both the autobiographical writings of the veterinarian Temple Grandin, whose autism has given her a unique insights into farm animal behaviour, and the poetry of</page><page sequence="3">Animais as Movement Rilke to claim that, in our approach to under standing animais, humans are: [...] disadvantaged by their consciousness and unable to perceive "the open" that is available to animal eyes [2006: 88]. Jakob von Uexküll used the term "Merk mal" or "perception mark" [O'Neil 2010] to denote those features of the world the per ception of which constitutes an animal's subjective world (Umwelt). Might our own "perception marks" of these non-human sub jectivities be arguably too constrained, and limited, not just by our linguistic orderings and scientific methods but also by our guilty conscience. Donna Haraway again: What if work and play, and not just pity, open up when the possibility of mutual response, without ñames, is taken seri ously as an everyday practice available to philosophy and to science? [2008: 22] In this paper, I want to explore the idea of studying, observing, practicing and sharing embodied movement as a means to experi ment with a new mode of Connectivity and "being" with non-human animais: [For movement] provides a physical mechanism to bridge the theoretical gap that separates human from non-human [Lulka 2004: 439], The article works towards a more prag matic "epistemology of movement". In the first section, I review the way in which ani mal movement, the potential of movement, motility and the résultant agency has provided a focus for both philosophical and represen tational accounts of the non-human animal. In the section that follows, I consider the use of movement as a mechanism (to borrow Lulka's phrase) for developing a more gener ous and inclusive notion of animality; one that opens the potential for a common lexicón of human and non-human understanding, a way of seeing and articulating with the animal world in a more ethical and less hierarchical, more vital, affective and relational sense. As Tim Ingold writes: Wherever there is life, there is move ment [2011: 72], Animais as Movement Animais have always been known through movement. Animais are movement. Aristotle wrote around 350 BC: Some animais fly, some swim, some walk, others move in various other ways. "Most animais are motile" which means the power to make themselves move the dic tionary reassures us. The Linnaean classifica tion of plants and animais turned largely (but not exclusively) on the "movement" of the latter and the fixity of the former. As Foucault writes in The Order of Things: If living beings are a classification, the plant is best able to express its limpid essence; but if they are a manifestation of life, the animal is better equipped to make its enigma perceptible [2004: 302], Animais make themselves known to us through their movement. The spaces they trace and occupy invite our orderings [Philo and Wilbert 2000],</page><page sequence="4">Henry Buller Foucault, however, goes further in ascrib ing to the late 18th Century palaeontologist, Georges Cuvier, a fundamental step in the understanding of animal locomotion. Reject ing the static and ordered "deployment of the visible" [Foucault 2004: 292] employed in classical taxonomy, both Cuvier and Buffon sought a more dynamic and functional com préhension of animal bodies, their movement, their responsiveness and their being. For Buffon, and the artists of the "Jardin du Roi": [Animal movement, and its représenta tion, offered] a formidable and sus tained challenge to the hegemony of the Cartesian animal-machine [Liebman 2010: 667], The résultant 19th Century shift from the taxonomic ordering of the animal kingdom to a more vitalist acknowledgement of individ ual, motile life was, in Foucault's eyes, a moment of epistemic change, one that argua bly led to the later séparation of ethology from comparative anatomy [Jaynes 1969]. More recently, the British geographer Sarah Whatmore offers, "in place of the rigid coun ters of the flat maps and species inventories of conservation science" [2006: 33], a more fluid interprétation of formerly impermeable catégorisations. Animal mobilities, she argues, and the "spaces of motion" they form, are "relational achievements" that reach far beyond mere biology and the simplicity of Nikolaas Tinbergen's "four Why's" [1963J. "Animal": the etymology is unequivocal, "anima": to breathe, to have spirit. To be "animate" is to be alive, to move. To be "inanimate" is to be still. One "animates" by making move, one obviously thinks of "ani mation". One "re-animates" by re-starting motion. From the primary somatic movement of the heartbeat, respiration and circulation, flow other movements which collectively become the animal (human or otherwise). One might begin to think of the animal as an achievement of multiple motions in Space, but an achievement that, in motion, is constantly changing, never fixed. Without being random or irrational, this spatialisation through move ment is, to use Deleuze and Guattari's phrase "nomadic" and "vibratory", constructed from, and in response to, the ever-shifting and chaotic surrounding world and its affordances [Lorraine 2005], This is a surface defined through presence and the performance of movement a territorialisation, that Deleuzian combination of milieu and rhythms. Movement appears in Derrida's définition of animality in terms of "auto-motricity": A spontaneity that is capable of move ment, of organizing itself and affecting itself, marking, tracing and affecting itself with traces of its seif [2008: 49]. Before Derrida, Bergson, in Creative évo lution argued that: What constitutes animality is the faculty of utilizing a releasing mechanism for the conversion for as much stored-up potential energy as possible into "explo sive" actions [i.e. movement and what he famously referred to as the "élan vital"] [1998: 132-133], In the animal [...] ail points to action, that is to the utilization of energy for movements from place to place [ibid.: 133],</page><page sequence="5">Animais as Movement Ultimately, for Bergson "movement is reality itself" [ibid.: 171] leading us to sug gest: Reality = Life = Movement = Animal, where the distinction between the object agent and its movement collapses [Boundas 1996]; a world whose reality is defined by movement. If we think of animal movement as a "process" then we rejoin Alfred N. White head and his "process philosophy" as well as Deleuze and "becoming" as imminence. Holmes Rolston III writes: Wildlife is organic form in locomotion [1987: 187], Perhaps the most well known portrayal of animal movement is the work of Muybridge in the latter decades of the 19th Century. It comes as no surprise that Muybridge's experi ments with moving film images should have begun with animais. As Akira Lippit, com menting on Muybridge's work, remarks: The figure of the animal has always been destined to serve as the symbol of movement itself [2000: 185]. Muybridge's film of the horse, in partic ular, has since become iconic. Muybridge gave the name "zoopraxography", as the study of animal movement and invented the "zoo praxiscope" to display individual images of animais as a continuous movement. For Muybridge and his zoopraxiscope, like the French photographer Étienne-Jules Marey and his fusil photographique, the new technol ogies of deconstructing animal movement, paralleling the new biological sciences which were busy deconstructing animal bodies, created a new animal ontology. As Stephen Guidry puts it: In these early attempts to make the movement-being of animais legible, the bodies of the animais and, ultimately, the animais themselves are simplified and stripped down to what is commonly seen as their essence: moving parts. The animais are understood as real because their movement over time can be under stood within the duration of the filmic event. Conversely, the filmic image is understood as representing reality because the animais are understandable as mov ing, as existing in real space and time and doing what it is that animais do, namely, moving about [2005: 60]. Yet, of course, these were not a continuous movement. Jonathan Burt points out in a recent paper [2006] that Muybridge's films are made up of individual images, independ ently taken. Were we to take a Bergsonian or Deleuzian stand on this, we might argue that real movement can never be simply a sequence of static points: Movement cannot be reconstituted on the basis of instants any more than being can be constituted on the basis of présents [Boundas 1996: 83]. Movement is something more, in move ment there is life. Animais also move away. The irony, as Akira Lippitt points out [2000], as did John Berger before him [1980], is that the growing appearance of animais in film offered a coun terpoint to their growing dis-appearance in the real world. Berger wrote: Everywhere, animais disappear [1980: 12]. Animais move away, and there are today légions of examples of such disappearance.</page><page sequence="6">Henry Buller They have become "spectral", existing in film or in other forms of technological résurrec tion, or indeed in zoos, which Berger defines as monuments to loss and absence. Even those animais that are present in zoos can confound us by being still, by not performing the movements we have come to associate with them, often entirely wrongly. As a resuit, animal movements become engineered into spectacle, whether it be through the design of enclosures which oblige animais to move in certain "iconic" ways. Most notably this is found in confinement and restraint. Farm animais exemplify this and particularly intensively reared farm ani mais; sows in farrowing crates, egg-laying hens in batteries, veal calves in crates and so on. They are denied movement, mobility and motility; and consequently, we refer increas ingly to such practices as unnatural and, para doxically, inhuman. For a long time, they were (and often still are) denied subjectivity and feelings. The movements that counted most were from the slaughterhouse, the movements of international trade, as objects, bodies and body parts, sites of accumulation [Shukin 2009]. Domestication is first and foremost, an act of corralling, of denying "free" movement to animais and, as we have got better at it, that physical denial of move ment has expanded into new forms; constrain ing genetic movement through breed controls, constraining of somatic and psychological movements through the use of drugs and other interventions. For many advocates of higher levels of farm animal welfare, it is so often the lack of free movement that has come to symbolise the unacceptable practices of contemporary animal husbandry. Signifi cantly, the most successful animal welfare gains over the last decade have been in the area of "free-range" production, with "ran ging free" be the expression, through motility, of animal subjectivity and therefore the right for moral considération. Finally, in movement lies agency. Through movement, non-human (and human) animais define not only themselves but also both space and time as their own [von Uexküll 2010], It is principally through movement that animais have been seen to have agency in our anthropocentric world. That physical, corporal and motile agency that attracts our attention, whether it be through acts of "resistance" or the active "co-construction" and "co-assembly" of the world through pres ence and vitality as Donna Haraway describes so well in When Species Meet [2008], Sarah McFarland and Ryan Hediger open their book on Animais and Agency [2009] with the Störy of a tiger escaping from San Francisco zoo and killing a spectator. David Lulka, in a fas cinating piece of Herzog's movie Grizzly Man in that same book, maintains that: Movement, being multidimensional at its core, is perhaps the most illustrative and ubiquitous manifestation of agency [2009: 87], The challenge for contemporary animal studies, and particularly those that draw in the social sciences, is how to conceptualize and engage with the liveliness of animal move ment as a legitímate way of knowing, exchang ing and developing "aesthetic" [Johnston 2008] or "positive" [Haraway 2008] knowledge; in Jamie Lorimer's words:</page><page sequence="7">Animais as Movement [How to] develop modes of affirmative critique for witnessing and evoking lively non-human différence and the forces that pass between human and animal bodies [2010: 238], Anyone who works with animais, plays with animais, keeps animais knows that it is predominantly through movement and through their embodied actions that animais negotiate with us and with each other. Move ment then, becomes more than functionality and physiological causation, more than agency; it becomes communication, interrelation and so on emerging dimensions of this motile ontology. In the growing animal studies liter atee, particular attention is now being paid to embodied and performative approaches as a means of witnessing and accounting for "the practical, sensual and affective dimensions to human-non-human interactions" [Lorimer 2010: 238], It is to these approaches I now turn. Movement as Communication and Understanding Embodied movement is something we human animais share with our non-human animalian confrères; that ability to be "able" [Nussbaum 2006], Jakob von Uexkiill [2010] recognised body movement, along with form but also independent of it as a critical perception mark for animal subjectivity. The question I want to turn to here is to what extent récognition of a communality in embodied movement allows us to reach across human and non human subjectivities in the création of Donna Haraway's elusive "positive knowl edge" [2008], Such communality was hinted at by Darwin: The young and the old of widely différ ent races, both with man and animais. express the same State of mind by the same movements [1899: 405]. In her considération of Lorenz' work with geese and jackdaws, Vinciane Despret makes a valuable connection. "Using his own body as a tool for knowing, as a tool for asking questions, as a means to create a relation that provides new knowledge", Lorenz, she writes, creates a sense of "being with" a young goose that constitutes a mutual co-domestication or "anthropo-zoo-genetic practice" [2004: 130 131]: This experience by which Lorenz constructs a "being with" sheds light on one of the ways bodies and worlds artic úlate each other: it is a particular mode of "disposing" both body and world. Lorenz produces a goose's body to allow a goose's world to affect him (and also to allow a human's world to affect a goose). He learns to be affected [ibid.: 131], This is a différent form of language. As Vicky Hearne puts it: With horses, as with dogs the handler must learn to believe, to "read" a lan guage s/he hasn't sufficient neurological apparatus to test or judge [1986: 107]. Later, she goes on: To be understood is to be open to under standing [ibid.: 109]. Of course, this communication between human and non-human can also betray us. Reviewing the famous story of Hans the horse, Vinciane Despret asserts:</page><page sequence="8">Henry Buller Their bodies were talking and moving against their will, outside the frame of their consciousness [2004: 113]. Deleuze and Guattari write "To become animal is to particípate in movement" [1986: 13] as the primatologist Barbara Smuts makes clear through the embodied empathy in her telling of an encounter with baboons in East Africa: The process of gaining their trust, changed almost everything about me, including the way I walked and sat, the way I held my body, and the way I used my eyes and voice. I was learning a whole new way of being in the world - the way of the baboon. I was not liter ally moving like a baboon - my very différent morphology prevented that but rather I was responding to the cues that baboons use to indícate their émotions, motivations and intentions to one another, and I was gradually learning to send such signais back to them [2001: 295]. In these encounters, Barbara Smuts has found, what Lori Brown calis "a valid form of communication and a foundation for ethics; and an interpénétration that yields a shared, co-created field of meaning and a concomi tant ethical engagement" [2007: 276], Barbara Smuts herseif goes on: I had gone from thinking about the world analytically to experiencing the world directly and intuitively. It was then that something long slumbering awoke inside me, a yearning to be in the world as my ancestors had done, as all creatures were designed to do by aeons of évolution. Lucky me. I was surrounded by experts who could show the way. Learning to be more of an animal came easily as I let go of layers of thinking and doing that sometimes served me back home but were only hindrances here [...] With great satisfaction, I relin quished my separate seif and slid into the ancient experience of belonging to a mobile Community of fellow primates [2001: 299-300], Movement then is a way of bridging the human/non-human divide, the positive knowledge of sharing movement with animais through encounter, through being together, whether on the farm, at home, in the wild and so on: Rhythms create multivariate, possible relations amongst living things expressed within and operating across différent milieus [Lorimer 2010: 61]. Bodily movement is a co-alignment that helps us understand each others' needs [Brown 2007], Through body movement, animais not only express, enact and develop their agency but they communicate that agency to others (to us) just as we do to them, creating new co assemblages of movement. Movement becomes a mode of existence [Ingold 2011] that is common to human and non-human alike and therefore a basis not only for human/non human somatic sensibility [Greenhough and Roe 2011] but also ethical engagement: 1 begin to construct an ethics of move ment, an ethics in which movement is viewed not only as a means of redefin ing human/non-human relations, but also as a means of facilitating the agency of non-humans in the construction of their own development [Lulka 2004: 440]. In recent years, a growing number of researchers and scholars have sought to</page><page sequence="9">mais as Movement extend the early interactive and observational approaches pioneered by primatologists like Jane Goodall, Dian Fossey and later Barbara Smuts to explore novel ways of using shared sensory, haptic and motile experiences with animais as a means not only of developing common practical knowledges and under standings but also of moving towards a more than anthropomorphically representational and more symmetrical sense of a common cultural Community where animais actions and animal agency are "no longer downplayed or ignored" [Franklin et al. 2007: 45] but are recognised as embodied forms of cross-species under standing and sensibility. New multi-species ethnographies or "zooethnologies" open up to investigation those "contact zones where lines separating nature from culture have broken down, where encounters between Homo sa piens and other beings generate mutual écol ogies and co-produced niches" [Kirksey and Helmreich 2010: 546]. Pet and companion animais, particularly through play relationships with humans, have understandably proved more accessible to these new "trans-species méthodologies".1 Donna Haraway, for example, refers to play between human and dog as only occurring among "those Willing to risk letting go of the literal" [2008: 240]. She refers to "those wonderful, joy-enticing signais like play bows and feints [that] usher us over the threshold into the world of meanings that do not mean what they seem [...] the world of meanings loosed from their functions is the game of co presence in the contact zone" [ibid.: 240]. Colin Jerolmak observes: Humans do not simply teach their dogs how to play; they evolve routines together ones that work for them [2009: 377], In his account of play with his dog Kate, David Goode [2007] employs a similar ethno methodological approach to reveal and explore the intersubjectivities that both permit and result from play. Goode describes that play, and the phenomenological layers of his and Kate's mutual engagement, in the following way: Matters assumed but not communicated; matters communicated but not spoken; and matters formulated into language. Under such a conception, "what is known or taken for granted in common" is not a reflection of language but of "assumed" intersubjective phenomenon anterior to formulation into language [...] Percep tion of and action upon naturally given features of the world do reflect the social membership of participants [2007: 89]. The key here is not a belief in mutual and symmetrical intentionality or even, necessa rily, a sense of a broader ontological flatten ing between human and animal. Rather it lies in the emergence of possibly shared set of knowledges, practices and ultimately culture, and "the interconnectedness of the various embodiments of this social form" [Jerolmak 2009: 387]. Jerolmak's analysis of human animal play reveáis non instrumental asso ciations that go beyond the formalities of 1. See J. Bradshaw and H. Nott [1995] ; A. Miklósi et al. [2000] ; M. Bekoff [2004] ; R. Fox [2006] ; É. Laurier et al. [2006] ; A. Franklin et al. [2007] ; D. Goode [2007] and A. Horowitz [2009]. '47</page><page sequence="10">Henry Buller language and catégorisation. The actors "loose themselves" [ibid.: 386] in what Catherine Johnston calis a process of "becoming liminal through play" [2009: 178]. Such approaches demand new methodo logical devices in which the movement and corporeality of both observer and observed are intertwined in a process of joint trans species accounting [Franklin et al. 2007], The difficulty is often to know what to look for/at. Which events, relations, movements are the stuff of such accounting? For Catherine Johnston [2009], citing Marc Higgin [2004] the critical process is that of learning to both perceive and extricate the otherwise unno ticed, unremarked and unrepresented. In a recent chapter that looks through the lenses of ethology and phenomenology to go beyond the seemingly absolute alterity of animais in human-animal associations, Hayden Lorimer explores what he calis "the lore of their like ness and the conséquences of inter-species sociality for the figuring of personhood" [2010: 56], Observing seáis over a period of several seasons basking on a river bank and, in his terms "learning-by-witnessing" [ibid.: 72], Hayden Lorimer identifies the study of movement and other embodiments as a future research trajectory for the "beyond worlds" of animal life and highlights the methodological importance of "watchfulness": in other words an openness to the nearness (which contains elements of both likeness and otherness) of inter-species relations. Yet there is another dimension at work here too; that of being or becoming interesting. For a more genuine, more generous animal studies needs to respond not only to what human researchers find inter esting about non-human animais but also to what non-human animais might find interest ing, either about each other or about us. In an intriguing chapter, Vinciane Despret [2005] asks: "Do sheep have opinions?" Drawing on the work of the primatologist Thelma Rowell, she explores an ethology that rather than sim ply observing behaviour according to our own hypotheses creates the possibility of new voices and new visibilities revealing of other ways of seeing. Within the field of farm animal welfare, Françoise Wemelsfelder [2007] has pioneered the technique known as "qualitative behaviour assessment" which uses the human observa tion and "qualitative perception" of farm ani mal bodies and their movement to discern the latter's subjective experience and emotional State. Avoiding the classic interpretive error of the "grinning chimpanzee", she argues: It is not the grin that is the body lan guage; it is how the animal grins, how its whole body moves, that makes the grin an expression of fear, or anger, or something eise [2007: 28], Françoise Wemelsfelder's methodology involves the close observation of animal movement, expressive State and behaviour. Critically, for her, such expressive states are taken not as abstractions but as lived and observed moments in time [Wemelsfelder et al. 2001], The resuit, she suggests, is a significant shift away from classic approach of animal behavioural studies: Thus it is not the "walking", "biting" or "vocalizing", or a combination of these</page><page sequence="11">Animais as Movement behaviours, that express fear or confi dence: the animal expresses these qualities through its behaviours. This principie, that animais are expressive "behavers" rather than assembled strings of "behaviour", is known in the wider psychological and philosophical litera ture as "agency" [ibid.: 219]. Reporting, on the one hand, "significant agreement between observers in the interpré tation of the animais' behavioural expres sions" [Wemelsfelder 2007: 29], and strong corrélations between these "subjective" obser vations and physiological measures such as animal heart rate and heart rate variability, Françoise Wemelsfelder argues: When we take the time to closely observe animais and the quality of their expressions, we can develop greater insight into their welfare and quality of life [id. ]. Elsewhere, Xavier Boivin and his col leagues [2003], Paul Hemsworth and Grahame Coleman [1998] have demonstrated the impor tance of positive human contact and physical interaction between stockperson and farm ani mal in the latter's welfare. They explore the possibility of shared meaning and coordination between farm animal and stockperson as each becomes accustomed, and is reassured by, the others familiar movements [Waiblinger et al. 2005]. Moving on This paper has explored movement as a lexicón of human/non-human relational cognisance, "somatic sensibility" [Greenhough and Roe 2011], and "dwelt understanding" [Johnston 2009]. It has suggested that embodied practi ces with animais constitute an important means of rendering articúlate, opening up and partic ipating in shared endeavour that uses "the Space between them to live with, rather than past, each other" [Johnston 2009: 154]. The conséquences of this are, as we have seen, both ontological and ethical. Of course, there are also limitations. In their comparison of scientists' relationships to both human and animal experimental subjects, Beth Greenhough and Emma Roe [2011] identify a number of risks emerging from an ethics based entirely upon "somatic sensibili ties". Two of them concern us here. The first is anthropomorphism, long criti cised by the natural science as an unaccept able form of mentalism not amenable to objective study [Wynne 2007]. Recent animal studies writings however have been swift to turn to the creative, empathetic and intuitive aspects of a more reflexive anthropomorphism, born not from the distance of observation but from the closeness of intertwined lives. They have proposed such variants as "critical anthropomorphism" [Burghart 1991], "reverse anthropomorphism" [Webster 2011] respon sible and informed or "aesthetic anthropo morphism" [Johnston 2009]. Such novel approaches espouse the idea that revised forms of anthropomorphism offer, at worst, a partial escape from anthropocentrism and, at best, a récognition of what we share with animais, and can experience with them, rather than simply what makes us différent. The second concern is proximity, both physical proximity (being with) and taxonomic</page><page sequence="12">Henry Buller proximity (being like). Certainly, contemporary accounts of embodied human-animal inter action place special emphasis on the physical ity of play, touch, regard and so on within what is often an inter-mammalian "contact zone", favouring such sites as the home [Jeromak 2009], the training ground [Haraway 2008], the garden [Johnston 2009], the labora tory [Greenhough and Roe 2011] and the park [Laurier et al. 2006], Yet more distant animal movements can also be shown to be constitu tive of embodied networks of human-animal relations [Whatmore and Thorne 2000] and non-human ontologies [Lulka 2004], Move ment is not simply the physical displacement of self-propelled entities across the surface of the world. Rather, as Tim Ingold points out, it is the very texture of the world [2011], Of course, in embodied encounters with animais, one can also get too close as many have found out. Suddenly, in Hayden Lorimer's words: Disjuncture can occur in all this Connec tivity [2010: 74], At the end of the day, there is the time deepened movement of our very corporeality. Cora Diamond calis for a more somatic under standing of animais when she asks: How much of that coming apart of thought and reality belongs to flesh and blood... [2008: 78] For, if we share movement, and bodies and flesh with non-humans, then we also share vulnerability and finitude [Wolfe 2008], the ability to suffer and, ultimately, the inevitabil ity of death.

Animals are move ment. As Akira Lippit remarks: "The figure of the ani mal has always been destined to serve as the symbol of movement itself'. Animals never stop moving, never stop moving us, never stop moving across and between the frontiers by which we set them apart. In the invigo rated engagement between the social sciences and ani mal worlds, movement and the sharing of movement offer us the potential for original ways of knowing ani mals and of understanding our relationship to them. This paper explores that potential and the ontological and ethical consequences it has for living with animals. Henry Buller, « Un rai de lumière et puis plus rien » : les animaux comme mouvement Les animaux sont définis par le mouvement. Comme l'a souligné Akira Lippit : « La figure de l'animal a tou jours servi de symbole au mouvement lui-même. » Les animaux ne cessent jamais de se mouvoir, ne cessent jamais de nous faire bouger et ne cessent jamais de fran chir les frontières que nous avons établies entre eux et nous. Dans l'intérêt renouvelé que les sciences sociales portent au monde animal, le mouvement et le partage du mouvement offre une voie originale pour appréhen der les animaux et comprendre nos relations avec eux. Cet article nous invite à réfléchir aux conséquences ontologiques et éthiques de cette nouvelle approche.
