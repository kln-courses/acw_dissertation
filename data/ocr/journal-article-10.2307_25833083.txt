<plain_text><page sequence="1">170 French Studies THE TWENTIETH CENTURY SINCE 1945 By H. G. MCINTYRE, Lecturer in French, University of Strathclyde i. GENERAL C. W. Nettelbeck, 'Novelists and their engagement with history: some contemporary French cases', AJFS, 35:243-57, looks at how four chosen novelists - Modiano (Dora Bruder), Le Cl zio (Poisson d'or), Echenoz (Un an), and Darrieussecq (Truismes) - deal with socio political realities and contribute to the larger process of reshaping France's sense of its own past. Noting the obvious differences between them, N. illustrates how these writers treat various experiences or examples of social exclusion - wartime deportation of the Jews, unemployment, immigration - and use their art to facilitate the integration of these experiences into the French, longer-term collect ive memory. J. Kaempfer, 'Le latin des Nouveaux Romanciers', Po tique, 113:45-59, cautions against the easy assumption that 'd pr dations burlesques' of Latin and classical learning in Simon, Pinget, and Butor indicate the nouveau roman's contempt for tradition. On the contrary, a more circumspect consideration of allusion and intertextuality in general reveals the 'relations complexes et ambigu s' which these texts maintain with the classical and Christian Latin tradition and, ironically, the amount of traditional background classical culture needed for a proper appreciation of the new genre. C. Britton, 'The representation of popular culture in the nouveau roman', AJFS, 35: 75-86, looks in some detail at Butor, Sarraute, and Robbe-Grillet to assess how the nouveau roman uses popular culture to define its position vis- -vis traditional or classical literature and in relation to postwar modernity. A wide-ranging, clear and well illustrated discussion encompasses L'emploi du temps, Degr s, Vous les entendez, Les Gommes, and other texts and brings out the differences of attitude among individual practitioners. A. Maazaoui, 'Po tique des marges et marges de la po tique', EsC, 38.1:79-89, is chiefly concerned to develop a critique of criticism of marginal writing and to suggest an analytical model for analysis which takes into account the characteristic constituents of the texte mineur. However, since he draws on a range of contemporary beur writing as his source material, the article will have appeal to the non-theorist also. G. Brajot, 'Le r le de l' tat: cinquante ans de politique th trale; 1945-1997', RHT, 4:365-88, provides a long and informative background reference source. While there is no discussion of individual authors or works, it describes the development and fluctuations of French cultural politics as they have affected postwar</page><page sequence="2">The Twentieth Century Since 1945 171 theatrical activity in France, emphasizing the remarkable consistency and continuity of these policies over forty years and the substantial increase in public subsidy during that time. M.-F. Christout, 'Petites sc nes parisiennes, un prodigieux foyer de cr ation: 1945-1960', ib., 311-18, chronicles the postwar explosion of theatrical activity in Paris, providing a reference treasure-house of names of theatres, plays, and producers. J. Cramesnil, 'Une aventure th trale en marge de l'institution: La Cartoucherie de Vincennes', ib., 327-48, describes the circumstances of the reconstruction and conversion of the former Cartoucherie but, in so doing, provides some interesting information, both in the body of the article and in a number of appendices, on the various companies (Th tre du Soleil, Th tre de l'Aquarium etc.) who have occupied the premises over the intervening years as well as some general comment on the post-1968 theatrical climate in Paris. M. Bishop, 'Profanes marginalit s: D'Adonis, St phan et Bancquart Chedid, Rognet et St ti ', EsC, 38.1:91-102, is not a synthetic study but a series of paragraph-length offerings or reflections on the poets of the title, plus for good measure Jaccottet, Dohollau, Bonnefoy, Baude, Vegliante, Albiach, du Bouchet, and Tellermann. They may be linked by the notion of marginality but the comment is concise not to say terse in places and the whole fragmentary. M. Whorton, 'Looking for kicks: promiscuity and violence in contemporary French fiction', NFS, 37:89-105, tackles the relation ship between the erotic and the pornographic and the use of pornography in serious literature. A lot of the essay is broad in scope and general in content, drawing on a range of theoreticians - Bataille, Lacan, Deleuze, Sontag - but there is also some reference to specific examples of contemporary French erotic fiction: Joel Hespey, S.M.: roman, Clothilde Escalle, Pulsion, Edouard Malvande, D ballage and Marie L., Confess e. C. Robinson, 'Sexuality and textuality in contemporary French gay fiction', FS, 52:176-85, ponders on the recurrence of the same thematic strategies in contemporary gay writers such as Yves Navarre, Eric Jourdan, Guy Hocquenghem, and Renaud Camus as in the canonical triumvirate of Proust, Gide, and Genet, emphasizing in particular the preponder ance of intertextual allusions and suggesting that the reasons for this are more complex than merely preventing the reader from adopting a single position. He indicates both the common and distinguishing factors in how these references are used across a range of novels to depict gay sexuality, arguing that the reader's complicity with the various narrative codes or devices employed depends on how he/she responds to combinations of variables in the text which constrain interpretation. J. E. Flower, Short French Fiction: Essays on the Short Story in France in the Twentieth Century, Exeter U.P., 182 pp., provides a</page><page sequence="3">172 French Studies varied and interesting collection of essays by different experts on a selection of short stories by Aym , Sartre, Camus, Yourcenar, Duras, de Beauvoir, and Tournier. All of the contributions are informed and thought-provoking and, as the editor points out in his introduction, open up broader issues than the individual stories they analyse. The volume is very well rounded off by an interesting chapter by J. Gratton, 'From the Nouvelle to the Nouvellistique3, which berates the apparent academic bias against short fiction in contemporary France and the consequent lack of critical attention, as well as tackling some of the areas deliberately avoided in the introduction, such as generic definitions. 2. INDIVIDUAL AUTHORS ARTAUD. L. A. Boldt-Irons, Tn search of a forgotten culture: Artaud, Mexico and the balance of matter and spirit5, RR, 89:123-38, retraces A.'s journey to Mexico to escape an old-world European civilization characterized by the primacy of intellect and mind over 'organs, nerves and blood'. The article examines how A. prioritizes images of the body and its organs in Le Rite du Peyotl chez les Tarahumor as, but does none the less touch on the question of the authenticity or veracity of A.'s account and acknowledges those - like Le Cl zio - who doubt that A. could ever have found what he was looking for among the Tarahumoras or anywhere in the real Mexico. AYM . See GENERAL. BECKETT. S. Critchley, 'Who speaks in the work of Samuel Beckett?', TFS, 93:114-30, focuses on the trilogy, exploring the dramatic tension deriving from the disjunction between narrative time and the non-narratable time of the narrative voice ('the time of dying'). This tension is described from the symmetries and dissymmet ries of the two parts of Molloy to its most radical expression in L'Innommable where disjunction takes place within the unit of the sentence itself. Blanchot is called on to help provide an answer to the question posed in the title. Who speaks? Not the T of a controlling authorial consciousness but the 'Not F of the insomniac narrative voice. M. Engelberts, 'Th tre et oppression dans Catastrophe de Samuel Beckett: r flexivit moderniste et r f rence politique', RUT, 2:169-90, seeks to reconcile two opposing views of this work, written for Vaclav Havel in 1982, as either self-evidently realist and political or as B.'s most obviously metatheatrical play. The detailed and thoughtful analysis argues that political oppression and theatre are intimately linked in Catastrophe in which B. demonstrates by means of theatre-in-the-theatre that drama, being a peculiarly social art form,</page><page sequence="4">The Twentieth Century Since iQ4 !73 is open to the same 'rapports de domination' (e.g. between producer, director, actor, stage crew etc.) as exist in society at large. BLANCHOT. D. Wilkerson, 'Transgression, masochism and sub jectivity: the sacrifice of self to the (feminized) space of literature in Maurice Blanchot', AJFS, 35: 228-42, draws on Foucaultian notions, as well as B.'s own conceptualization of transgression, along with a dash of masochism la Deleuze, in order to demonstrate in two texts - Thomas l'obscur and L'Arr t de mort - that the writing subject in B. 'in its transgressive propulsion outside itself and into a simulacral feminine mode simultaneously brings into focus the limits of Western logocentrism based on an active/passive paradigm and displaces them through the codification of a passive jouissance for the whole subject'. Put more succinctly, 'B. in his representation of the feminine as that which enables the male subject to free himself from himself in the space of the work and thereby guarantee its authenticity, therefore transgresses the phallo(hetero)centric matrix of representation even while affirming its limits.' YFS, 93, is a special issue devoted to B. Two articles might be of interest to the literary critic: H. de Vries, ' "Lapsus Absolu": notes on Maurice Blanchot's The Instant of My Death' (30-59), approaches this most puzzling and generically unclassifiable of r cits - fiction, literary criticism, philosophy, autobiography? - via Derrida's Parages and wonders if the title does not run counter to the central characteristics of B.'s preoccupation with death in earlier works. A lengthy and detailed discussion, drawing on Levinas, Heidegger, and Adorno, argues that this is not a natural death or suicide but 'a failed, delayed and finally a delegated execution'. D. Rabat , 'The critical turn: Blanchot reads des For ts' (69-80), looks at B.'s friendship with des For ts and the various commentaries devoted to des For ts by B. over the years, emphasizing their political empathy in the fifties - their common opposition to de Gaulle - and defending B.'s reading of des For ts against that of Bonnefoy. BONNEFOY. A. Pearre, 'En attendant Eros: Yves Bonnefoy et l' rotisme', FrF, 23:85-100, goes in search of the 'fonction po tique' of B.'s eroticism. The discussion flits over a few writings before settling on De vent et de fum e which is prefaced by remarks on the ambiguous nature and the positive and negative function of eroticism in general and its spiritualization in B. and concluding that B.'s eroticism is 'fertilement ambigu, h sitant entre le sensuel et le spirituel.' BUTOR. See GENERAL. GAiLLOis. P. F. De Domenico, 'Revenge of the novel: Roger Caillois' literary criticism in the wake of the 1930s', RR, 89:381-410, is a long and informative study, clearly argued throughout, of C's reactions to the political and intellectual debates of the thirties and</page><page sequence="5">174 French Studies how they led to his prolonged questioning of the value of literature as a means of political expression. The article argues that the title Puissances du roman is misleading since it masks the novel's fundamental impotence and inability to galvanize the masses into revolutionary action, which makes the roman engag of the time an inherently futile activity. C's identification of the primary functions of myth in human evolution in Le Mythe et l'homme are also considered since it is due to its loss of mythic quality that the novel in C's view is an ineffective tool for political transformation. CAMUS. V. Howells, 'Clamence as a Lucifer figure in Camus' La Chute', RoS, 31:45-56, takes as its starting point a parallel between La Chute and Dante's Inferno, in particular Clamence's similarities to Dante's Lucifer but complicates things by suggesting a number of other possible identities for Clamence. It develops into an interesting and wide-ranging survey of the style, structure and background of La Chute while always returning to the central Lucifer figure of Clamence. Id., 'Crossing the cultural divide: Camus and the problem of race in La Pierre qui pousse', FMLS, 34:353-65, argues that Le Premier Homme suggests the need to reconsider the traditional Eurocentric view of C's writing. She undertakes this revision by setting aside previous psychoanalytical and sociological approaches to La Pierre qui pousse and offers instead a detailed textual analysis to illustrate how racial difference remains an obstacle to the elusive royaume. Touching on aspects such as geographical location, paralinguistic modes of expression, and the macumba ceremony, she concludes that C's positive closure is a contrived ending which fails to reconcile or resolve contradictions in his relationship to the ethnic Other. (See also GENERAL.) CIXOUS. M. Manners, 'The vagaries of flight in H l ne Cixous' Le Troisi me Corps', FF, 23:101-14, considers the Gradiva figure as a trope of gender-transgressive verticality and Freudian mediation. Discussion develops into a three-way comparison with Jensen's 1903 novel of the same name and Freud's analysis of it in Delusion and Dream. DARRiEUSSEcq. See GENERAL. DE BEAUVOIR. See GENERAL. DE DUVE. R. Chambers, ' "Sida Mon Amour." Aids eroticism in Pascal de Duve's Cargo Vie', NFS, 37:123-36, starts from the basic premise that the eroticism of Aids and the HIV virus in Cargo Vie mirrors the relationship of the text to its desired readership, making the reading/writing relationship inherently erotic by nature. Both Eros and Thanatos figure prominently in the subsequent discussion since this 'exercise in transformative erotics' is seen as a reproach to those, symbolized by the writer's lover, who turn away from Aids and</page><page sequence="6">The Twentieth Century Since ig4 175 its consequences. De Duve repudiates and transcends the mere eroticism of sexuality of those who are only sid rables in order to attain the superior, 'flamboyant' eroticism of disease and dying of those who are actually already sid r s. DES FOR TS. RSH, 249, is a special issue devoted to D. J. Roudaut, 'Des propri t s sonores d'une tendue insoup onn e' (19-33), begins with a close look at language and its effects - sonority, musicality, alliteration etc. - in Les M g res de la mer before moving on to broader issues in Po mes de Samuel Wood which he distinguishes from those of Les M g res de la mer by their 'vigilance'. J.-M. Gleize, 'Altitude z ro' (35-40), looks back with the benefit of hindsight at D.'s response in Tel Quel io (1962) to their survey 'La litt rature d'aujourd'hui' to which Barthes, Sarraute, Butor, Cayrol, and Robbe-Grillet also contributed. F. Delay, 'Qui y a-t-il dans Le Bavard?' (41-50), elicits the help of Jean-Beno t Puech, D.'s Boswell, in identifying intertextual material in Le Bavard, finding inter alios Kleist, Kafka, Dostoievsky, Constant, Hemingway, and Faulkner. From his French sources, D. draws turns of phrase rather than ideas or substance while foreign influences, e.g. Kafka, Rapport pour une acad mie or Kleist, De l' laboration progressive des pens es dans le discours, operate more on the level of thought than language. D. Viard, 'La parole par d faut' (51-64), concentrates on Ostinato, acknowledging her debt to predecessors such as Roudaut and Rabat in exploring D.'s central preoccupation with expressing self or the absence of self in a 'langue en peine de parole' and emphasizing what is for her the central paradox of Ostinato, that D. is not writing for his 'improbable lecteur' but for himself. N. Barberger, 'L'hypoth se de l'enfant' (65-74), discuses the sense of loss, of 'ce qui fait d faut', which haunts D.'s writing and attempts to recover or reconstitute the child he might have been in Une m moire d mentielle. Beckett is drawn into the discussion for the sake of comparison. J.-M. Maulpoix, 'Qui a peur de Samuel Wood?' (75-80), no sooner asks the question: who is speaking in Po mes de Samuel Wood? than he declares it a futile enquiry. None the less undaunted, and despite the confusion of two voices in the work, he asserts fairly confidently that Samuel Wood is definitively the 'voix m me' of D.'s poetry. G. Mac , 'Une identit d faillante' (81-86), despite its brevity, squeezes in references to a number of texts from La Chambre des enfants. It is a series of reflections and reactions with no particular point to labour. D. Rabat , 'Ostinato et la question de l'ach vement' (87-103), cites D.'s own warning that Ostinato is only an ' tat provisoire' of a work in progress as a preliminary to exploring the notion of ach vement which constitutes the 'moteur, inqui tude [and the] ins curit ' of Ostinato. This long and thoughtful interven tion, always clearly argued, concludes that Ostinato is not some kind</page><page sequence="7">176 French Studies of Proustian r capitulation de soi but in fact invents a whole new way of envisaging the role of memory which emancipates literature from Proustian dominance. DURAS. J. Game, 'The writing of the in-between: a study of Marguerite Duras' La Vie mat rielle', FF, 23:337-52, is offered as a first attempt to read La Vie mat rielle as a primary source for the study of D.'s work. With theoretical input from Deleuze, it concentrates principally on temporal and spatial aspects of in-betweenness' with a view to clarifying D.'s thinking on the relationship between self, being, and writing. M. Hanrahan, Je est une autre: of Rimbaud and Duras', MLN, 113:915-36, seeks to remedy what she perceives as a lack of historical perspective in D. criticism. The study falls into two parts. The first explores the relationship between self and other and the poetics of alterity in Le Ravissement de Lol V Stein in the light of Rimbaud's famous dictum, Rimbaud being one of the few authors whom D. has explicitly acknowledged as an influence. The second part flips the coin to look at Rimbaud and draw parallels in the light of the analysis of Lol V Stein. (See also GENERAL.) EGHENOZ. M.-S. Armstrong, Le Parcours zolien de Jean Echenoz', RR, 89:429-44, detects amidst the multifarious influences which make up E.'s intertextualit foisonnante' the primal but neglected presence of Zola. After pinpointing 'vignettes zoliennes' from the Rougon-Macquart in E.'s early novels, the discussion proceeds to a detailed consideration of Lac to illustrate E.'s veritable obsession with Zola. The discussion is not only detailed but ingenious also in finding references to Zola in the names Zog 1 er d'Albanie and Jean Echenoz, as well as a partial anagram of Echenoz himself in Mouezy-Eon. (See also GENERAL.) ERNAUX. S. Mcllvanney, Annie Ernaux: un crivain dans la tradition du r alisme', RHLF, 2:247-66, sees E., who uses the classic techniques of realism, as an unusual synthesis of modernism and tradition. She examines various general aspects of E.'s realism - the choice of working class milieus, the notion of biens ance, linguistic registers, the recurrence of themes and characters - before concen trating on two specific aspects, repr sentativit and objectivit , in La place and Une femme. The conclusion underlines the way in which E.'s realism aims to swing the literary balance in favour of her preferred working-class settings in a literary tradition which is still 90 per cent bourgeois. GENET. M. Paganini, Ecriture carc rale: l' chapp e belle', EsC, 38.3:40-50, is largely devoted to G. and his 'langage d'institutions', illustrating how G.'s predilection for word-play and his tendency to juxtapose ideas result in a proliferation of meaning and a rich texture of allusions which culminate in a 'rh torique de l'impr cision'.</page><page sequence="8">The Twentieth Century Since iQ4 177 Discussion is based on G.'s prose only, principally Miracle de la Rose. Claude Puzin, Jean Genet: Les Bonnes3 Le Balcon, Nathan, Collection Balises, 128 pp. Ian H. Magedera, Jean Genet: Les Bonnes, GIGFL, 76 pp. (See also GENERAL.) GRACQ,. P. Auraix-Jonchi re, 'De Barbey Julien Gracq. Le Roi Cophetua, complexe Aurevillien?', RR, 89:243-58, cites Barbey d'Aurevilly as one of the more complex of several literary influences on G. Despite some general discussion of influence and similarities, the premise of the article is that evidence for an 'authentique textualit ' can only come from a detailed reading, in this instance of one of G.'s most enigmatic texts, Le Roi Cophetua, which takes its sustenance from two d'Aurevilly texts in Diaboliques, Le Rideau cramoisi, and Le Bonneur dans le crime. It would appear, however, that G., by modifying his sources, in particular by changing the portrayal of female figures, has altered their meaning. LE CLEZio. A. Trouv , 'Une lecture de La Ronde de Le Cl zio', RHLF, i : 123-130, examines this short text in search of an answer to the question of how to read L., more specifically how to reconcile that 'volont d'ouverture et de renouvellement' which is the basis of his inspiration and vision with the idea of a constant reprise of the same themes and motifs. Any neorealist reading is misleading since the text only appears to be a r cit objectif. Beneath the surface lurks a 'riche mat riau fantasmatique' which works on the reader's subconscious and encourages us to an 'exploration active', which counteracts in advance the sclerosis of any fixed system of values. (See also GENERAL.) MALET. T. Bridgeman, 'Paris-Polar in the fog: power of place and generic space in L o Malet's Brouillard au Pont de Tolbiac', AJFS, 35:58-74, looks at the relationship between M.'s detective Nestor Burma, hero of the Nouveaux Myst res de Paris series and Burma's past and surroundings. This well-organized and clearly signposted paper highlights aspects of Brouillard which set it apart from other volumes in the series. The central and cohesive role M. accords to Paris creates allusive links to the city's 19th c. and its literature in particular. These, in conjunction with the importance of place and memory as the dominant forces in the narrative undermine the detective-novel model. In the end, the tensions between Burma, Paris and his own past redefine not only Burma's role in the novel but also the novel's status within the roman policier genre. MODIANO. See GENERAL. PEREG. S. Levy, 'Le temps mode d'emploi', Litt rature, 109:98-115, looks at the somewhat particular configuration of time in La Vie mode d'emploi. Beginning from the apparent contradiction between the movement implicit in the title and the 'immobility' of the content and descriptions, it tries to reconcile these by joining up the</page><page sequence="9">178 French Studies pieces of a typical Perec puzzle. Whether or not the attempt is successful, even with the help of Borges, any elucidation of P. must be welcome. PINGET. See GENERAL. PONGE. J.-C. Rebejkow, 'La Fin de l'automne dans Le Parti pris des choses de Francis Ponge', IL, 2, sets out to demonstrate how autumn is used as a metaphor for P.'s work, but in fact his ambitions are much wider. The analysis leads to comparisons with Le cycle des saisons and to a rereading of Pluie and a reappraisal of La Fin de l'automne as a manifesto or a 'po tique nouvelle de l' criture.' M.-L. Bard che, 'Ponge ou le parti pris des gloses', Po tique, 115:369-83, surveys the various linguistic or stylistic strategies adopted by P. to combat the 'caract re impropre des paroles' - i.e. the salet or inevitable degradation of language in use - which the writer is constrained none the less to put up with. These strategies include manipulating the semantic associations and connotations of a phrase, various kinds of syntactic modifications, homophonic d figement, and paradigmatic derivation. QUENEAU. J. Meizoz, 'Queneau, les linguistes et les crivains', Po tique, 115:351-67, reviews Q.'s long-standing and central interest in matters linguistic, with particular reference to his rejection of 'le fran ais filandreux' of some of his contemporaries and his own tripartite project to renew literary French (lexis, syntax, and spelling) by redefining a style based on the contemporary spoken language. The result is a clear and informative background study detailing various formative influences on Q.'s thinking; the example of Ramuz, Frei's ideas on correctness and incorrectness, the work of Vendry s and Marouzeau between 1900 and 1914. SARRAUTE. J. Rothenberg, 'Nathalie Sarraute's changing genres: from "disent les imb ciles" to Elle est l ', AJFS, 35:215-27, assesses how well the subdety and ambiguity of S.'s tropisms translate from her novels to her plays. A comparison between the complex fiction 'disent les imb ciles' (1976) and Elle est l puts to the test a suggestion made to S. by Arnaud Rykner that each of her plays derives from a preceding novel. Rothenberg finds an important shift of emphasis between novel and play, due to the different demands of the dramatic genre, particularly in the treatment of characters which are presented with more marked sexual stereotyping and in more clearly defined social relationships than in the novel. S.'s innate and strong sense of form ensures a successful transition to the more anthropomorphic theat rical genre. SARTRE. CAIEF, 50, reprints a number of papers on S. given at its 49th conference in July 1997. Among those of most interest to the non-philosopher are: R. Goldthorpe, 'Les Mots: "Soi-m me comme</page><page sequence="10">The Twentieth Century Since ig45 !79 un autre" ' (231-45), which situates Les Mots vis- -vis the evolution of S.'s thinking on the self, particularly Valt rit du soi. Although the discussion is theoretical in nature for the most part, it will provide useful background material, along with some reference to the Carnets de la dr le de guerre, for the literary critic. J.-F. Durand, 'Le jeu de vivre: une lecture des Carnets de la dr le de guerre' (247-62), sees in their form and preoccupations a response to a time of uncertainty when we hear the 'craquements' of S.'s thinking. He also finds in the Carnets the first traces of the developing notions of exteriority and historical authenti city which will constitute the jeu de vivre. G. Rubino, 'De Roquentin au dernier touriste: po tique(s) et anti-poetique(s) de la ville' (263-78), looks at S.'s portrayal of townscapes from La Naus e to the fragments of the unfinished La Reine Albemarle ou le dernier touriste. La Naus e stands apart from other portrayals which are seen through the eyes of visitors and tourists. Bouville, moreover, represents inauthenticity, whereas elsewhere S. attributes sense and essence to towns. S. Teroni, 'L'Arc de Philoctete; Sartre et l'attirance pour le don' (279-95), takes as its starting point S.'s identification with the unlikely figure of Philoctete and broadens in scope to encompass wider issues, notably 'la probl matique du don', which the writer considers one of the basic elements of the thematic and structural unity of S.'s writing. Despite the largely theoretical orientation, there is some reference to Les Mouches, Le Diable et le bon dieu and Saint Genet. J.-F. Louette, 'Huis dos et ses cibles (Claudel, Vichy)' (311-30), looks at the origins and targets of S.'s anti-religious theatre as exemplified by Huis dos. Making an initial detour via Les Mots to sketch in S.'s anti-religious family background, L. analyses Huis dos as an attack on the prevailing Catholic ethos of Vichy theatre. He is mostly concerned to argue that Huis dos is a 'r criture critique' of Claudel's Le Soulier de satin. (See also GENERAL.) SIMON. A. Cl ment-Perrier, 'Regard sur un motif du Jardin des Plantes3, Po tique 115:273-85, moves from a synopsis of a planned cinematic montage at the end of Le Jardin des Plantes to a consideration of S.'s sensitivity to the visual in general and the importance of the visual and descriptive in his writing before finally settling on the many and various symbolic meanings of the paon in his work. In the process, the discussion moves well beyond Le Jardin des Plantes and into other areas, e.g. Orion aveugle and La Route des Flandres. N. Pi gay-Gros, 'La Voix dans les romans de Claude Simon', Po tique, 116:487-94, feels on the other hand that too much emphasis on the visual and descriptive in S.'s novels has tended to obscure an essential aspect of his work, its vocalit . She argues that, far from being opposed, parole and regard are closely interdependent and that the voice in S. is not merely a 'surcro t de signification' but meaning itself since, despite</page><page sequence="11">i8o French Studies the absence of any 'discours psychologique5, the voice suggests those invisible characters which the narration does not represent.
