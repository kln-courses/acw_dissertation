LLOYD MORGAN. I. A GOOD many thoughtful people are rather weary of seemingly interminable disputes as to what we mean, or should mean, by sundry 'isms-such as naturalism, mechanism, vitalism. In con- troversial discussion it sometimes seems that when one or other of these words has been pronounced with suitable intonation, nothing more need be added-though, of course, it must be repeated again and again with increasing emphasis and more piquant intonation, in such phrases as " obsessed by vitalistic prejudice," on the one hand, or " still under the sway of mechanistic dogma," on the other hand. Hence not a few harbour suspicions that the un- ending controversy turns largely on something other than the factual evidence to be adduced. So often do they find the words " mechanism," " vitalism," " naturalism " used as words of emotional appeal from the pulpit to those who are right-minded in the congregation, that they doubt their validity as contributory to scientific argument. And they say: " If this be so-and to us it seems to be so-why not drop these words or relegate them, at least for a while, to cold storage? Cannot you help us to see the facts, or what you regard as facts, and the generalizations you base on these facts, from a fresh angle, even if this entail fresh nuances of verbal expression ? Never mind if some of the words you use carry meanings rather different from those to which we N</page><page sequence="2">142 C. LLOYD MORGAN. are accustomed. That matters little. In that we have already received some salutary training at the hands of exponents of relativity. Let not that deter you, so long as it helps us to get clear sight of that world-view which presumably you want us to envisage." In response to some such tacit appeal Professor Whitehead asks us to consider, at large and in detail, An Organic Theory of Nature. I, for one, welcome this comprehensive name for an interpretation which is in line with, and carries further, much that is distinctive of a well-marked trend of contemporary discussion. This I may do without subscribing to all the articles of the philosophical creed Mr. Whitehead develops in his Lowell Lectures on Science and the Modern World. Even where I fully agree with him I shall follow his lead with faltering and less sure tread. And if, perchance, in thought or in verbal expression, I venture to take a line of my own, I trust that none of my heresies will be imputed to him. What, then, are we to understand by an organic theory of nature ? This, first: that in it all kinds and modes of action and reaction, all kinds and modes of relation and co-relation, all types and sub-types of natural entities, are to have place. To this end one invites those whom it may interest to enlarge and extend the currently restricted meaning of the word " organic " and of the word " organism." In what I have elsewhere written I lacked the boldness to do so. But under able leadership one gains courage. Our chief concern here and now is with the widened concept of organism. I have been wont to speak of natural entities with some misgiving as to the appropriateness of this expression. An atom is such a natural entity; so is a molecule and a crystal; so is an amoeba, an oak tree, a man. In a catholic sense so, too, is any social group of which certain characterizing features may be predicated. I have been wont to emphasise a salient feature</page><page sequence="3">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM, 143 in any natural entity-namely, that what I speak of as the con- stituent items of its stuff go together in substantial unity on a determinate plan which characterizes each type of emergent entity according to its status in a natural hierarchy. In principle this salient feature is common to all such entities at all stages or stadia of advance. And recently I ventured to assert that it is untrue to say that this kind of relatedness of parts within a whole affords a criterion that serves to distinguish a living organism from all lower natural entities.* Now, if this be a feature common to all emergent wholes which have this type of organization, it is well to have a common name for any such whole. Mr. Whitehead suggests that theword " organism " shall be used with such a common meaning. Follow- ing his lead, I shall use this word whenever what I have called the items of stuff are in such relations to each other, severally and collectively, as to give to the organism what I still speak of as substantial unity. Within such an organism each part is what it is, not only in its own peculiar right, but also in virtue of its relation to all other parts within the unitary whole. An organic theory of nature lays stress on this cardinal character common to all organisms (not only living organisms), each having substantial unity according to its status. If this extended use of the words " organism " and " organic give pause to thought, so much the better. Some will object that it purports to annul the distinction between the living organism and the physical atom, on the one hand, and, on the other hand, that which is characterized by social organisation. But the adjectival qualifications remain unaffected, and still serve to mark such distinctions as we find. What we seem to need is a set of nouns which shall serve to indicate what is common to all instances of a general type of integral relatedness throughout * Life Mind and Spirit, p. 66. N 2</page><page sequence="4">144 C. LLOYD MORGAN. nature, and appropriate qualifying adjectives which shall serve to indicate the differentiating features in the several instances which stand at different levels. This would enable us to distin- guish likeness in kind from diversity in mode, as I use these words. Organisms, in the catholic sense, are alike in kind; but physical, living, and social organisms differ in modal status. There is modally more in a living organism than any not-living organism discloses; but in that living organism, as such, there is modally less than is disclosed in the social organism. As things are, one has in some way to give expression to that which is common in kind in words which are current in the usage of modality. Under such usage the words " organism " and " organic " are earmarked by biologists for plants and aniimals. They may well resent any broadening of meaning in the interests of a more general interpretation of nature. This must be faced. Furthermore, if one elects to speak in lower level terms-say, in terms of items of " stuff " which go together in unity of " sub- stance "-it may be alleged that one seeks to interpret everything in physical fashion only. And if, on the other hand, one uses higher level terms-introducing, perhaps, the word " purposive " with its distinctively mental implication-forthwith one is charged with dramatizing in anthropomorphic wise. In the former case one uses modal words at more than their modal face- value. In the latter case one empties the words one uses of their fuller modal significance. In either case there is risk of mis- apprehension. Now the word " organism," as used by the biologist, has a middle position between these extremes. It implies the adjective "living," and what this implies is the storm-centre of con- troversy. Some there are who interpret all organic action in the modal terms appropriate to physics and chemistry. Others there are whose interpretation is couched in the modal terms appropriate to psychology.</page><page sequence="5">A CONCEPT OF THlE ORGANISM. 145 IG is difficult to see on what logical grounds biologists of the first school-the so-called mechanists-can resent the downward extension of the connotation of the word "'organism" to natural entities which, as they claim, differ only in their lack of super- added complexity-differ nowise essentially in type of action or behaviour. It is, however, easy to see on what logical grounds biologists of the other school-the so-called vitalists-can resent, and will no doubt reject, a concept of organism which implies that it can adequately be discussed in terms of an organic theory of nature without introducing any further concept such as entelechy or elan. An organic theory of nature which recognizes diversity of modes is neither mechanistic nor vitalistic. It accepts all that it finds. No duly accredited characterizing quality distinctive of the living organism, as contrasted with the not-living, is dis- regarded or slurred over. It is just these characterizing qualities that are claimed to be emergent because they are not reducible to, or deducible from, the qualities of organisms of lower status in the hierarchy. In brief, one deals with characterizing qualities of living organisms, as modally different from those of, say, molecular organisms, on the same general principles as one deals with the characterizing qualities of molecular organisms, as modally different from those of atomic organisms. It is because, as I think, there are certain general features of organisation that are common to all organisms, whatsoever may be their status in a natural hierarchy-it is for this reason that I welcome the use of one word for each and all of them. But if we do this it seems permissible to vary the ways in which we may give verbal expression to these common or general features, extending them both upwards and downwards, so long as one makes it clear that, in upward extension, there afe specific modal characters progressively more than the general feature</page><page sequence="6">146 C. LLOYD MORGAN. common to all organisms, and that, in downward extension, there are specific modal chaxacters retrogressively less than those that obtain at the higher level. After all, one wants in some way to distinguish the general feature that is " common form " from the specific characters which earmark what I speak of as " modality " in a sense that, I hope, is comprehensible. And how one does this does not much matter if it may help others to grasp the notion to which one seeks in some way to give verbal expression. I have hitherto tried to do so in terms of stuff and substantial unity. But I feel pretty sure that some people have taken this to mean material stuff constituting such a substance as sugar or salt-anyhow, something obviously connected with gross matter. No doubt some risk attends the use of words which may be thus misinterpreted. I now run even graver risk of being misunderstood when I use words taken from the other end of the hierarchical scale-when I borrow, and adapt to my purpose, words properly applicable (it may be said) only to social affairs-when I try to state a concept of the organism in words which must be emptied of their specifically modal significance in those affairs. Taking this grave risk, this is how I should venture to express the general position. The organism-any organism in the unrestricted sense-is, I make bold to say, a community of members in fellowship, each of which is in sympathy with, and of service to, the others, and each of which plays its part in relation to the parts played by other members in the organic whole which is the organism, whatsoever may be its modal status. Mi. Whitehead's extension of the range of application of the word " organism " goes hand in hand with the implications of an organic theory of nature which is taking a new form. And the objection to any such extension is, so far as I can gather, mainly "on principle." It is the whole theory, the implications of which the word " organism " are now to carry, that must stand the</page><page sequence="7">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 147 brunt of attack-not merely a new convention in the use of this word. But, since a new convention is entailed, one must make passably clear what are to be characterizing features of any organism in the extended application of the word. This I now attempt to do in terms of " fellowship " and certain allied words. They are used for purposes of exposition in the hope that thereby the way in which I, for one, characterize any organism may be grasped by those who care to understand. One's difficulty is to find some word or set of words which shall express what one wants to express, and this difficulty is all the greater since those words from which one has to make selection are already earmarked for use at some more or less definite stage of evolutionary progress. It is worth while to consider briefly the general position. Let us assume that what one may speak of as a doctrine of emergent levels can make good its claim to be understandable. Then there are some words which we may agree to use only at this, that, or the other level; some words which we may agree to use at all levels. Let us speak of the former as restricted to one-level usage, and of the latter as extended to all-levels usage. The trouble is that you and I may not agree as to which words shall have one-level signification and which words shall have all-levels signification. Under these circumstances the best course for me to pursue is to tell you as clearly as I can the usage I adopt, so that you may at least understand, even though you are nowise prepared to accept. I beg you then to understand that an organic theory of nature is, for me, a distinctively all-levels theory; that, within this theory the concept of evolution and the concept of the organism are all-levels concepts; and that for purposes of exposition (I ask no more) I elect to use the word " fellowship " and some allied words with all-levels signification. My aim is to help you to understand. Whether you agree or not is another matter.</page><page sequence="8">148 C. LLOYD MORGAN. But if you read into words used in subservience to my theory the implications they convey on your theory, there is bound to be misunderstanding. We have, then, words applicable at all levels and one-level words. But when one comes to details one has often to show in some way that, though one still uses the noun with all-levels import, one wishes to direct attention to the manner in which it may be applied at some one level. Adjectival restriction of the noun enables one to do this in ways that leave little scope for ambiguity-mental evolution, the atomic organism, molecular fellowship, and the like. It may be said that, even for purposes of exposition, the word "fellowship" is, under well-established convention, so distinctively, a one-level word-some may say a word of spiritual import- that its all-levels use is, to say the least of it, ill-advised. I fully admit the force of this objection to my use of it. I should welcome some other word or set of words to express what I want to express. As things are, I make use of the best I can find. It should be realized that, in the organism as thus conceived, the emphasis falls, not so much on what a member is, " in itself," as on what it does in fellowship with other members. By what it does, I mean the part that it plays in the community-the service it renders to others and to the whole. We are dealing with a tbeory of behaviour or action; we must therefore lay stress on how things go, and on how they go together. In the conventionally restricted concept of organism we mean the living organism-a going con- cern. In the broadened concept, any organism is a going concern. Subject to downward extension, one sometimes speaks of the " life " of a star, of the uranium atom, or even of some machine. With due stress on action, then, the integrity of the organism- any organism-is preserved only so long as each member-be it electron in an atom, be it workman in a factory-plays a special- ized part in sympathy with others in the organism as a whole;</page><page sequence="9">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 149 and the integral whole is what it is only so long as all the members behave or play their several parts in fellowship and mutual service. Further light is thus thrown on the concept of evolution. The upward trend in evolution is towards associative fellowship, and towards higher modes of association. But we have to realize that, in the world as we know it, there is also disassociation. Thus Spencer's word " dissolution " has added significance. It is dissolution of fellowship or partnership. Is it mere play upon words to link up part, part played, and even partnership ? Without going so far as to assert that " every part, while remaining in fact what it is, is ideally the whole " (Lossky), the contention, under an organic theory, is that each " partakes " in the whole, and that the whole is in the parts all of them-in so far as its share in the substantial unity is " im- parted " to each of them severally. The nature of this unity, omnipresent in the whole, depends on the modes of relatedness in virtue of which that whole is an organism. It is in respect of " modes " not " kinds " of relatedness that I, for one, speak of " emergence." But what we are trying to get at just now is that which is common at all levels of modal emergence. So we start with the social organism where the words " com- munity," " members," " fellowship," " service," " sympathy," and the rest, are used with their current modal signification. We pass downwards, from the social organism, to a man, an amceba, a bacterium; to a crystal, a molecule, an atom-as far as accred- ited science can take uis. And then we ask: Do we at all stages find something of the same sort as members in fellowship under sympathy ? If so, we must deliberately strip off, as we work downwards step by step, those specifically emergent character- istics which distinguish the higher modes of action, and qualities co-related therewith, from the lower. I know full well that it may be said: You have no right to speak of a " sort of fellowship " if you empty this word of all that</page><page sequence="10">150 C. LLOYD MORGAN. is distinctive of human fellowship. To talk of electrons in an atom, or atoms in a molecule, as associated in fellowship, is a preposterous misuse of words entailing a degradation of concepts. Can a mere " it " play a part, or render service, or act in sympathy with others ? Assuredly not. Essential to the concept of fellowship is that each member plays his part, behaves, or acts, with conscious reference to the acts of other no less conscious participants in the well-being of the social community. Here we have associative partnership of free agents. Human purpose rules. There is implied some worthy end to be attained through fellowship, service, sympathy, and the rest. Apart from such objection " on principle " as underlies this summary rejection of the downward extension of the notion of fellowship, I fully realize the conventional objection to the use of words which carry modal significance at a high level of mental evolution for that which, as I think, is " common form " in all evolution, physical no less than mental. But if there be some- thing common to all levels in the hierarchy of organisms one must in some way give to it verbal expression. That this is the best way I am far from asserting. One has to include under sympathy, for example, what, rightly or wrongly, the physicist does not uncommonly include when he says that this or that piano-wire, when the dampers are raised, vibrates in sympathy with some note firmly bowed on the 'cello. In this sense there may be sympathetic reaction to some specific mode of physical action- often said, under downward extension of another word, to be "selective" reaction. Even under relations of the physical kind, is there not a valid sense in which one may say that any change in the part that one constituent membex of the social community plays in some measure influences the part that each of the other members plays, so long as all are attuned in associative fellowship? Only on such terms as these, according to an organic theory of nature, is the substantial unity of any organism pre-</page><page sequence="11">A CONCEPr OF THE ORGANISM. 151 served. If this fail there is disassociation-there is dissolution of fellowship. Seeing that one is forced again and again either to coin new words or to adapt old words to meet the requirements of new ways of thought, this mode of expression may at least be given a trial with a little dose of good-will. How, then, does it run as com- pared with that couched in terms of items of stuff in substantial unity ? Let us provisionally arrange " natural entities " in ascending order in an emergent hierarchy. Such a suite may be: Atom, molecule, colloidal unit, " biocule," cell, multicellular organism, community of such organisms. Here "biocule " stands for a hypothetical link in the chain. One may express the underlying principle of the hierarchy thus: In atoms the items of stuff are electrical units which go together in substantial unity under a determinate mode of relatedness; in molecules the items of stuff are atoms in a new mode of relatedness; and so on up the scale. Under generalized statement, z-items of stuff are so related as to constitute y; y-items to constitute x; x-items to constitute w. In due course living cells are inter-related in corporate unity to constitute the multicellular organism. Nor need we stop here. Even in regard to physical relatedness, is not the social community an association of members in fellowship under new modes of corporate relatedness ? Having thus reached the notion of fellowship, under a theory of nature which is through and through organic, we feel justified, at any rate for expository purposes, in inverting the order. We start with the social organism as a community of members (men and women) in sympathetic fellowship on an organized plan. Then, remembering that some sort of sympa- thetic fellowship, on some sort of determinate plan, is wbat ex hypothesi is distinctive of any organism, there follow in descend- ing order of status, say-</page><page sequence="12">152 C. LLOYD MORGAN. The living organism: community of members (organs: cells: " biocules "). The colloidal organism: community of members (molecules: atoms). The molecular organism: community of members (atoms). The atomic organism: community of members (electrical unit-events). In such a series evolution is passage from lower to higher status in organisms each a community of members which play their parts in fellowship each influencing, and being influenced by, the others under sympathy. And this passage must be discussed in terms of all the modes of fellowship in all the kinds of relations of which in each organism there is evidence. So far as emergence obtains it would name the incoming of new modes of complexity, of quality, of value, and so forth, characterising new modes of fellowship in all kinds of relation, including, of course, relations of awareness culminating in objective and reflective reference, as organic to nature. Can organic evolution in all the higher and in many of the lower animals receive adequate treatment if relations that reach the level of conscious reference be left out of account ? We have, then, the concept of organism and the notion of fellowship. We want so to combine this concept and this ancillary notion that each shall throw light on the other. Now, if we start with the living organism, or with the crystal as a not-living organism, the idea of a definite boundary-surface comes to mind. We must therefore ask whether this distinguish- ing feature is essential to the concept of the organism in our extended sense of the word. Take extreme cases. Take the " microscopic " atom on the one hand, and the " macroscopic " solar system on the other hand-on the assumption that we may regard sun, planets and satellites as members in fellowship. Neither has a definite boundary-surface within which the organism</page><page sequence="13">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANSM. 153 is enclosed. It may be said that the words " within "and " beyond" thus lose their common-sense meaning. But may they not still mean " within or beyond this community of mem- bers that play their parts in this kind of fellowship " ? If this be accepted as not discordant with common-sense notions, it seems that the idea of a well-defined boundary-surface is not essential to our concept of organism. Does not this serve to re- move one difficulty in applying the concept to the social organism ? But another, and perhaps graver, difficulty may arise when we find that, in social affairs, one man may play a part in half a dozen modes of human fellowship-may be, as we say, a member of several "isocieties ": the English Association, the Aristotelian Society, the Corporation of his City, the Wesleyan Community, his Golf Club, and so forth. Are we, then, to talk of so many " organisms " ? Does not so many " organized societies " suffice to express the position ? Furthermore, it may be said that in human Uffairs the only organisms, properly so-called, are the men and women who play their parts in those relations which we call social. And then it may perhaps be said that how they play their parts does not serve to determine what these organisms severally are; it serves only to indicate what they severally do under certain given circum- stances. A man is what he is, " in himself," no matter whether, in due season, he plays the part of butler, or sidesman, or flautist, or husband, or father, or advocate of free trade. So, too, in respect of " natural entities." An electron, an atom, a molecule, a living cell, as an organism, is just what it is, no matter what modes of relation it enters into. The earth is what it is-to wit, the earth, no more and no less-though it is also in physical relations to the sun, to sundry planets, and to its satellite, the moon. Two closely allied questions here arise: (1) Granting that the concept of emergence is valid and can be rendered fairly definite, where is the primary locus of emergence-in the com-</page><page sequence="14">154 C. LLOYD MORGAN. munity or in its constituent members ? (2) Is a member in associative fellowship what he is qua member in virtue of the modal relations that obtain within the community of the organ- ism ? The questions are closely allied. And I think that the affirmative answer to the second, which we must give in accordance with an organic theory of nature, entails, on that theory--at least in my rendering of it-the centring of emergence in the constituent members of the community. I say on that theory. On a wholly different theory of nature it may be said that a somewhat called, let us say, Molecularity, descends upon a group of atoms and creates the molecule; and that a somewhat called Life descends upon a colloidal cluster of molecules and atoms in such wise as to be creative of the living organism. For better or worse I distinguish emergent (or resultant) evolution as a scientific proposition (under my characterization of science) from any form of Creativity-to adopt Mr. Whitehead's designation. Creativity, in my view, raises a cardinal issue in Theory of Reality; but it has no place in an organic theory of nature which is based on the generalized conclusions of modern science. This does not mean that I deny to Creativity a due place in the larger problems raised under Theory of Reality. It means only that I plead for a distinguishing of issues that I feel convinced are analytically distinguishable. For me, there- fore, the current phrase Creative Evolution should be replaced by Evolution subject to Creativity-or something of that sort. I cannot here discuss so large a problem. I do not claim that the distinction I draw must be accepted; but I beg that those who care to listen to what I have to say should be at the pains to understand what I seek to express; otherwise, we shall be at cross-purposes. With regard, then, to the locus of emergence, I feel confident that it must be sought in the members in fellowship; and I find</page><page sequence="15">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM, 155 the notion ot tellowship helpful in giving expression to the answer I give to the rather crucial question: What is emergent and where is it emergent ? Of course, we may say: A new mode of fellow- ship is emergent; it now is, whereas heretofore it was not. But, if we probe deeper, it seems that the emergent character (if such there be) must be traced down to the constituent members of the community. If in a human community there be an emergent attitude in saesthetic valuation, it is in the men and women of that community that, if anywhere, an emergent character must be sought. If in some ant-community there be evidence of emergent advance, what is emergent is in the several ants as members in fellowship. In the multicellular organism, so far as emergent, we must look for such properties of the cells in fellowship as give to the living organism its emergent status. And so on. But in each case, though we must seek for evidence of emergence in the members, it is only under some determinate mode of fellowship, no less emergent, that something genuinely new finds expression. In other words, what the member is, in emergent regard, that it is, qua member, in its relations to all other members. And this was the answer we gave to the second of the closely allied questions. One is here tempted to open up the vexed matter which logicians of differing schools discuss, in prolonged debate, under the heading: Internal v. External Relations. But there the universe of discourse is theory of knowledge. Here our primary concern is with theory of action. Although the issue is of much philosophical import, and although it is germane to an organic theory of nature* it must suffice to submit that, where the stress is on action, the part that, in the organism, some member plays in relation to others is " in part " determined by the parts that these others are playing. This brings us back to the notion of associative fellowship in action or behaviour. * cf. Whitehead, " Science and the Modem World," pp. 174-5.</page><page sequence="16">156 C. LLOYD MORGAN. Let us assume that electrical units play their parts in the fellowship of the atom; that atoms play their parts in the fellow- ship of the molecule, and so on up the gamut as far as we can profitably go in dealing with concrete situations. Let us assume that there is some measure of determining reciprocity in part- playing under relations of sympathetic influence. So far we have members of like status in concerted fellowship. But the implications of an organic theory, if they be pressed home, may go further than this. A further implication may be that all members, whatever may be their status, play their parts subject to the inter-related fellowship of the organism as a unitary whole. What does this mean? Let us revert to the principle of a hierarchical order. We start with low-level organisms which we label z's. These are associated in a higher mode of fellowship to constitute y's; these again are associated in a new and yet higher mode of fellowship to constitute x's; and so on up a scale disclosed by factual evidence. Thus, down the scale, we have, say, v's playing their parts within each u, w's within each v, and so on till we get down to bottom-level z's. It is clear, then, that each z plays a part at all levels within the highest organism in the hierarchy. The question then arises: Is the part played by any z in sympathy with what is going on at all levels above it in the complex organism u ? I take it the answer is: We do hot know. How the atoms play their parts in the molecules of my body nay be a purely molecular affair. But they may play their parts with a difference dependent upon the condition of my body as a whole at the time being. No doubt it may savour of extravagance even to suggest, as an open possibility, that while I listen to the opening chords of Handel's Largo there is no physiological process in my body that remains wholly uninfluenced by what goes on in my brain; that all molecular changes within me then and there run their course</page><page sequence="17">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 157 with a difference; that even the orbital dance of electrons in atoms that are members of each several molecule responds in some measure to the physical influence which takes effect on the cochlea of my ear. It seems here to be suggested that everything is related to, or co-related with, everything else. And this, as it stands, seems pretty vague. Here, however, it is not quite so hopelessly vague, for it is qualified by the proviso " within the human organism." Even so, as a scientific proposition, we must regard it as an open possibility. But as a philosophical proposi- tion-speculative, no doubt-it does seem to be implied in an organic theory of nature. And I gather that this is Mr. White- head's belief. " Thus," he says (p. 111), " an electron within a living body is different from an electron outside it by reason of the plan of the body . . . and this plan [of the organism which includes the body] includes [also] the mental state." The words within square brackets are mine. " But," he adds, " this prin- ciple of modification is perfectly general throughout nature, and represents no property peculiar to living bodies." If this be so, it is an implication of an organic theory of nature that, within an organism, all the members, whatsoever may be their status, play their several parts, or, in a liberal sense behave, in sympathy. But in order that there be such associative fellowship, in our extended sense, the constituent members must in some way, or ways, be related. If after prolonged and resolute analysis we dig down to what seem to be the simplest of simple events-however they may be described or defined-still in all organisms, whatever may be their status in a hierarchy of ascend- ing levels, it is only when these events, or communities of events, are related in certain ways in accordance with some describable natural plan-it is only then that substantial unity obtains within this or that organism. It may be the plan of the atom, of the molecule, of the crystal; of the cell, of some gland, of the living organism; of some associative fellowship of living organisms; 0</page><page sequence="18">158 C. LLOYD MORGAN. always a subtle combination of kinds and modes of relatedness, so that one can say: Such and such mutual relatedness in fellow- ship, such and such observable or inferable behaviour. II. There seems to be not a little misapprehension as to the position which those who advocate emergent evolution are concerned to defend. Some critics seem to suppose that the contention is: All evolution is by discrete steps, each of which introduces something new; therefore no evolution is by con- tinuous slide with resultant outcome. That is not so. At any rate, I, for one, disclaim intention of saying anything of the sort. It has been my aim to emphasize the contention that what is genuinely new, in a sense duly characterized, in pro- gressive advance, is of the emergent type, as distinguished from the resultant type. My claim is: Some evolution is by discrete steps, each of which introduces something new. Stress on emergent factors in evolution does not imply denial of resultant effects. When we consider organic evolution this must be borne in mind. If the biologist adduces thousands of examples of changes in living organisms which are interpretable mechanically as strictly resultant, that is no argument which serves to disprove the occurrence of changes which, as we think, must be interpreted as strictly emergent. If both types of change are in evidence, our aim should be to distinguish the one type from the other. In the last quarter of a century a change (resultant or emer- gent!) seems to have come over the scene where the play of interpretation is rehearsed and re-enacted. In old days the concept of that which one may speak of as continuous slide was so dominant that steps apparently discrete were attributed to failure to detect the slide that occurs in the interval between</page><page sequence="19">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 159 what is given in our step-like observations. There must, it was said, ex hypothesi, be no sharp angles, but a smooth change of curvature, in which all trace of salience will finally disappear. Nowadays there is a noteworthy tendency to regard apparently continuous slide as a mass-effect attributable to our failure, under statistical method, to isolate individual entities in the crowd which forms the mass-aggregate. On this view the rounded-off curvature of nature is like that which is presented to appearance when a great number of polygons, each differing very slightly in position, are superposed in one composite photograph with con- tinuous outline just a little blurred. We have yet to learn which hypothesis-if it be a case of one or other-best fits the facts of close and minute observation in this or that field of scientific inquiry. Here we come into touch with that which physicists, in their specialized field of extraordinary exactness, discuss under quan- tum of action. In far wider fields, not susceptible of such exactness of treatment, we come into touch with the concept of emergence. On quanta I shall not touch lest I should burn my fingers. It is with the bearing of the slide-or-step question on resultant or emergent advance that we are here and now con- cerned. In speaking of such organisms as may be placed in an ascending hierarchy of emergence, I laid stress on that substantial unity in some definite mode of fellowship which gives to it the status of an integral whole. If the question be asked: What measure of substantial unity ? I should reply: Such measure as we find; but always such measure as to render the organism capable of maintaining its existence as such. It must not be supposed that what one means by substantial unity is a characterizing feature that is absolute and ideally per- fect. This may be, and I think is, for some exponents of Theory o 2</page><page sequence="20">160 C. LLOYD MORGAN. of Reality, an implication of this expression. Suffice it to say that, in my usage, neither the word " organism "nor the expression "an organic theory of nature," nor "substantial unity," is intended to convey any such implication. It may be that no organism affords evidence of more than an approximation to substantial unity in the sympathetic action of all its members. As things are, the nearest approximation seems to be disclosed in the atom. Contrast this with such measure of substantial unity as has so far been reached in the social organism. Between these extremes is the living organism. What measure of substantial unity here obtains ? To answer this question we must turn to the evidence. The biologist may adduce many instances, observable, let us say, in the course of embryological development, which indicate what one may speak of as a mosaic structure of, for a time at least, relatively independent centres of action. He may say that they disclose, at this stage, very little functional inter-relation in biological unity. No doubt they are bound up in one embryo under certain purely physical relations. But other than this there is little that can be spoken of as substantial unity. I am not wholly unacquainted with such facts. I submit, however, that, from the point of view of general theory, though these mosaic items are collocated in juxtaposition under such physical relations as this entails, still, so far, they constitute an aggregate of organisms in resultant fellowship rather than one organism in the substantial unity that characterises emergent fellowship. This re-introduces a distinction which is worthy of fuller con- sideration than it has yet received. It raises further questions as to what implications the word " organism " is or is not to convey in our organic theory of nature. And this leads up to the larger question: Is nature as a whole to be regarded as an organism ?</page><page sequence="21">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 161 I confess to some qualms of doubt as to the propriety of my use of the word " fellowship" in so wide a sense as to include what I spoke of above as resultant fellowship. This doubt arose when in the foregoing section I suggested that sun, planets, and satellites may be brought under the rubric of associative fellowship. They are, however, in some sense " associated " in the solar system. The part that any one of them plays within this system as a whole is in large measure determined by the way in which their associates are behaving. Action here is in physical sympathy with action elsewhere. There is some substantial unity of harmonious accord within the system as a whole. And so on. Does all this render my expository notion of fellowship applicable to the solar system ? In the liberal sense intended I find it difficult to say in what respects it does not. Let us so far extend our liberality as to give it the benefit of the doubt. Are we, then, to regard the solar system as an organism ? Half a century ago-let us say prior to 1863, when Huggins opened the door to the application of spectroscopic research to the stars-the solar system was interpreted in terms of celestial mechanics. Since then the attention of astronomers has been more and more concentrated on cosmic physics-on the internal constitution of the stars, including our sun, in terms of atomic and sub-atomic changes. But even now the solar system as an association of sun, planets, and satellites, is still interpretable in the dynamical terms appropriate to celestial mechanics. Are we, then, to regard the solar system in this respect as an organism ? If so, we must regard it as the outcome of resultant advance. This means that with full knowledge of some given phase of the state of aff irs in the solar system-taken as an isolated system- any subsequent phase could be confidently predicted. They all fall within one uniform natural plan on the basis of which deduc- tions can be drawn. On such deductions most of the almanac predictions of astronomy rest.</page><page sequence="22">162 C. LLOYD MORGAN. If, then, it be permissible to regard the solar system as an organism, we should speak of it as a " resultant organism," the outcome of " resultant advance." " Emergent advance " is that which I have sought to illustrate by such a series as atom, molecule . . . living organism and the rest. At each stage in advance the outcome of one mode of fellowship, say that of the atom, becomes suddenly-or so swiftly that intervening steps have not as yet been traced-a member of a different mode of fellowship, say that of the molecule. It need not forthwith become such a member. During some brief period of transit, for example, it may not pass within the range of molecular influence. Thus for awhile it retains its atomic freedom from the restraint which molecular fellowship entails. But when it does enter into further fellowship, when it does come within molecular range, it does so under certain assignable conditions, it behaves in accordance with some definite plan. At each ascending stage of the hierarchy there is something quite new in the plan-something that leads the man of science to say: This calls for expression under a different formula. The plan, as new, is universal in the sense that it is common to all atoms, all molecules, and so on. To emphasise the common ground-plan at each stage one speaks of the atom, the molecule, the crystal unit-more comprehensively, of the organism; or, subject to appropriate adjectival restriction, one speaks of the molecular organism, the living organism and the rest. At each stage, then, we descry a ground-plan distinctive of that stage. But within the ground-plan, say, that of the atom, there are sub-plans, say, that of the hydrogen atom and that of the oxygen atom. The number of electrical units in fellowship increases as we ascend the atomic scale; the specific manner of fellowship differs in such ways as the evidence discloses. There is, however, something else that the evidence discloses. It discloses that with such and such a maner of atomic fellowship</page><page sequence="23">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 163 there go what we speak of as distinguishing qualities or proper- ties. This holds good not only for the several atoms, but for the several molecules, crystal units, and so on. Whatever else may be said about such qualities and properties-and they are not easy to classify-this, I think, may be said: With specific spatio- temporal plans, having certain primary modes of physical related- ness, there are constantly co-related certain modes of relatedness that are other than spatio-temporal and primarily physical only. One is now in a position to state the truth-claim that is embodied in the notion of emergence. The claim is that there is in nature not only resultant advance on one uniform plan. That, however, is merely an indefinite claim. The definite claim is that there is also what we call emergent advance on a multiform set of plans. But some say that the notion of emergence is so smudgy and vague that to speak of a definite claim is absurd. We must ask, then: How may emergence be so characterized as to rebut the oft-repeated taunt that it is merely a philosophical whimsy of which men of science need take no notice ? One must seek to render it definite in some definite domain of scientific inquiry. I select one which is more exact than most of the other domains-that which embraces the atom and the molecule, two of the stages in our emergent hierarchy. In the interest of exactness let us concentrate attention on plan-spatio- temporal plan in a physical field-regarding co-related quality as secondary thereto. The claim, then, is that, when we pass from one ground-plan to another-from that of the atom to that of the molecule-what is distinctive of the new ground-plan is not reducible to, and therefore not deducible from, that which is distinctive of its evolutionary predecessor; and, if not deducible from the data disclosed in the ground-plan of its predecessor, then, as new, not predictable from what one may speak of as the platform of the old. It is this, we claim, that characterizes</page><page sequence="24">164 C. LLOYD MORGAN. emergent advance; and this, we claim, holds good for any two emergent stages. In one's capacity as generalist one is dealing with the existing state of scientific knowledge. But one has to rely on the findings of specialists. Now, specialists in atomic research give one a pretty clear notion of the interplay of protons and electrons in the atom. One turns to those who can speak with authority on the molecule. They tell us, as I understand, that atoms in a molecule are inter-related on a ground-plan quite different from that on which the electrical units are inter-related in the atom. Of this different ground-plan one may say: In the atom it was not; it now is in the molecule. One would suppose that without cavil one may call a ground-plan that was not and now is a new plan. But the crucial issue, stated in practical form, is: Could those who are intimately acquainted with the old plan foretell from the platform of this intimacy the quite different inter-relations which characterize the further fellowship of atoms in a molecule on the new plan ? It is difficult to see how they could do so if the ground-plans are quite different. Unfortunately, it is not the sort of thing that can readily be put to the test in practice. One canot train some able student on the atomic plan only; ask him to predict the molecular ground-plan; and see what he makes of it. So we turn to the logician. Some logicians tell us in effect that, given all the known factors of the atomic plan, there are not adequate and sufficient data for saying what the molecular plan must be-that is, for deducing the new from the platform of the old. Hence the stress that Dr. Broad lays on the logical criterion that may be expressed by saying: Not deducible from the data afforded by what is given prior to emergence. Does this rule out of court deduction wherever emergence obtains ? What it does rule out of court-if the phrase be appropriate-is the deduction of a new ground-plan, or such</page><page sequence="25">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 165 qualities as may be co-related therewith, from a known ground- plan lower in the emergent hierarchy. It precludes, for example, prediction of the nature of molecular fellowship from our know- ledge of the nature of atomic fellowship. But if there be good grounds for accepting such a generalization as may be called " the law of the atomic series," deduction uwthin that series on the basis of that law is permissible. There is, for example, nothing to preclude the prediction of what will be the nature of such and such a " missing link " in the chain of atoms. It will be put to the test if or when the element, interpolated on the basis of the law, swims into the ken of discovery. Such predictions are common at each hierarchical level. If they be fulfilled, the grounds for accepting the law of the series are strengthened. Nay, more. Should we be in a position to formulate a " law of hierarchical emergence " it would be permissible to deduce, on the basis of that law, the nature of some missing link within the hierarchical series. What seems to be precluded on principle is any prediction as to the nature of what may next be evolved beyond the hierarchical series as given up to date, or even whether anything further will be evolved. " Gentlemen," says the logician, " let us keep within the evidence." Now whether, in what I have said with respect to the atom and the molecule, I have made out a good case for emergent advance, it is for those who are acquainted with the facts to decide. But, supposing that I have done so, it may be said that in applying the concept of emergence anywhere else in nature, I go beyond the evidence. Beyond this evidence-yes. The first thing to do is to establish a principle of interpretation. That done in one domain of inquiry, the next thing to do is to show in what other domains the principle is applicable. And this is clearly a matter of evidence within each of these domains. One may ask, for example: Does it apply, not only within the atom- molecule domain, but also within the molecule-crystal domain ?</page><page sequence="26">166 C. LLOYD MORGAN. Then one would turn to such evidence as the researches of Sir William Bragg may disclose. As I read the evidence, it is in favour of the emergence of a new mode of crystalline fellowship differing from that of molecular fellowship. Or, on a larger scale, one may ask: Does it apply not only within the atom-molecule domain, and within the molecule-crystal domain, but also within the physical-physiological domain? Is life-fellowship a new mode of fellowship ? I hold that it is a new mode on a new plan. I believe that, in accordance with a " law of hierarchical emerg- ence," the transition from the not-living to the living exemplifies emergent advance. I contend that there is here, too, a new factor, or suite of factors, in evolutionary progress. I need not discuss the evidence. One would only come back to the question already discussed. One would merely raise this question in the new form: Does the living organism disclose a ground-plan of fellowship, the distinctive features of which are not deducible from that of any not-living organism ? Some of us think that it does. We contend that the distinctive features of the one could not be predicted on the data afforded by the fullest and most intimate acquaintance with the distinctive features of the other. But we do not regard this as a camouflaged confession of ignorance. We regard it as the profession of fuller knowledge of evolutionary advance. It does not block the way to further inquiry; it opens up new lines of investigation. If our concept of emergence be founded on observable facts; if under deter- minate conditions, susceptible of definite statement, new modes of fellowship do emerge; if, as we claim, there be coming into view a law of the hierarchical sequence of emergents-on what grounds can this be called the mere hiding of a confession of ignorance under a name that is so vague as to deceive the unwary ? Is it not rather a worthy endeavour to extend our knowledge of nature-?</page><page sequence="27">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 167 Our contention is that to-day there are far more cogent grounds for incorporating emergence in a schema for the inter- pretation of nature than there were half a century ago. But the trouble is that one who advocates emergent evolution is some- times supposed to deny resultant evolution. He is supposed to say in effect: Not resultant advance, but emergent advance. Let us consider the attitude of those who do nothing of the sort. Fortunately, a brief statement will suffice. In resultant advance the conditions are such that there is homogeneous continuity in some one mode of fellowship. Hence deductive conclusions are relevant all along the line of advance. With adequate knowledge of the law of such advance, predictions as to the exact nature of any later phase could be made from the platform of any earlier.phase. More strictly, the events are all on one platform with uniform slope or one-equation curve. Hence the unlimited range of astronomical predictions in so far as they are based on principles of resultant mechanics. Now change- the venue to the vexed biological issue. The "mechanist " says in effect that all processes and products from first to last-from the not-living phase to the living phase-are susceptible of resultant interpretation. They are all on one homogeneous plane of resultant advance. And he points with justifiable pride, which others may share, to the outcome of such treatment. There are, as he frankly admits, sundry physiological processes which still present difficulties. What of that ? Further research on this method of interpretation will resolve them in due time. What, then, say those who have been led to accept emergent advance ? Do they deny any one of the successful achievements based on resultant treatment ? If they do they are, as Dr. Broad might say, remarkably silly. What they do submit is that there is a mode of fellowship in the clustering of events within the living organism that is of such a nature as not to be deducible</page><page sequence="28">168 C. LLOYD 'MORGAN. from that which obtains in the not-living. They submit that, in detail, there are some physiological processes which elude the meshes of the resultant net, which are on a different level of emergence, which could not be predicted from the not-living platform. They may be wrong. The verdict of the future with regard to emergence in the living organism may be: Not proven. We are, however, dealing with matters as they are while the case is still sub judice. And our attitude is: Resultant advance in plenty; as much as you can prove; but not a few residual matters which bear witness to emergent advance. If this be so, is not the upshot this: The living organism in physiological regard is such as to exemplify evolutionary advance, not resultant only, not emergent only, but both resultant and emergent ? Should not this be our attitude in broader biological regard and in social regard ? Now that the concept of emergence has been admitted into the field of serious discussion there is grave danger of its being used wildly and without discrimination as a popular catchword. People talk of the emergence of the elephant or the mongoose; the emergence of the social hymenoptera. of polymorphism in ants; perhaps the emergence of mimicry or of display in courtship; perhaps also the emergence of humani civilisation. And critics of emergent evolution pass on to other matters with a tolerant smile. It may, however, be said: We thought that evolutionary progress is what you stand for in what you speak of as an organic *theory of nature. But now it seems that you propose to introduce sundry rather puzzling reservations. If polymorphism in ants- to select one of your examples-if, in other words, the differences of structure and diversities of behaviour that characterize the members in fellowship within some social community of ants be not the outcome of evolutionary process, of what natural process is all this the outcome ?</page><page sequence="29">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 169 I do not suggest that all this is not the outcome of, or does not afford an instance of, evolutionary progress. My aim is to dis- tinguish, within this progress (1) that which is deducible on the method of resultant treatment, from (2) that which is not deducible on this method. The former I speak of as resultant advance; the latter as emergent advance. I submit that, on the evidence, we find in the field of biological inquiry both emergent and resultant advance. My plea is for careful analysis. If emergent evolution be accepted, it does not follow that all evolutionary progress is emergent. That being so, what has to be done-and I hope will be done-is to disentangle (i) such not-deducible emergent factors as may have contributed to this or that end- product of evolutionary progress from (ii) what is deducible in concurrent resultant advance. There are a good many critics who seem not yet to have grasped just where the concept of emergent evolution is applic- able. They seek to apply it where I, for one, hold it to be in- applicable. They may then ask: Where is the evidence for emergence in the evolution of the solar system as interpreted under celestial mechanics? Or, turning to the biological province of inquiry, they may ask: What bearing has this concept of emergence on, say, the theory of natural selec- tion? It may savour of extravagance if I express the opinion that on this theory, as such, it has little or no bearing. To make my meaning clear, I must ask: Are we, under natural selection, dealing with the survival of variants or with the origin and transmission of variations ? In the opinion I express I assume that the theory of natural selection as such deals with variants, and that the origin and transmission of variations fall for discussion under a different theory-that of genetics. If this be so, the issue for natural selection is a plain issue. Are some variants weeded out in " the struggle for existence " or are</page><page sequence="30">170 C. LLOYD MORGAN. they not ? If some are weeded out, leaving others to survive, I regard such elimiation as a resultant effect. That leaves the origin of variations (or of mutations) to be discussed as a separate issue. It opens up a wide field of inquiry, including Mendelian research. Here, in any genetic theory. the question does arise: Is this or that variant the outcome of resultant, or emergent, advance; or is it a joint product of both ? If both are given in the evidence, the emergent factors should be distinguished. My plea-and here it comes to a plea-is: If the concept of emergence be accepted, let us make quite clear just where this concept is applicable. When I express the opinion that it is not applicable to natural selection, as such, it should be obvious that this does not preclude the survival of those variants which have genetic characters that can be shown, under searching analysis, to be emergent in origin. Biological inquiry includes both natural selection and genetics; and genetics discloses, as I think, both emergents and resultants. Is there not pressing need for the exercise of distinguishing analysis? Revert now to the distinction between celestial mechanics and cosmic physics. The former, as we have seen, affords examples of resultant advance. But in the latter there is need to distinguish (i) resultant advance in certain mass-effects from (ii) emergent advance in what we may speak of as microscopic detail. In its modern form cosmic physics deals with the evolution of stars; with the energy-changes within them; perhaps with the transformation of what the plain man supposes that he under- stands by " matter " into what he feels quite sure he understands by "radiation," and much else. For one interpretation of a fascinating story one may turn to Dr. J. H. Jeans' Recent Develop- ments of Cosmical Physics*; for an alternative version (in some * Supplt. to Nature, Dec. 4, 1926.</page><page sequence="31">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 171 respects) one must tackle at least the first chapter of Professor Eddington's The Internal Constitution of the Stars. Most of us have a bowing acquaintance with some of the salient features of this new story of the heavens. What are some of the questions that arise for us here ? May we regard that which is so often spoken of as " the life of a star " as the evolution of an organism in our extended sense of the word ? It seems to have, as distinguishable, early, middle, and later phases. It is describ- able in terms of a rounded-off fellowship of events. Does it, for us, exemplify resultant or emergent advance ? What we may speak of as net-results and mass-effects, statistically treated, seem to fall under the heading of " deducible "; but in micro- scopic detail the whole story discloses bewildering but orderly changes in the atomic fellowship of protons and electrons, with alternations of evolution and dissolution under conditions of temperature and pressure so high and so great as to be well-nigh inconceivable. Of molecular evolution there are little more than a few occasional instances. Now all this is, for us, emergent in principle. We have here an intensive study of what occurs, under extra-terrestrial conditions, at the sub-molecular stages of our ascending series with, near the close of a star's eventful career, the first fruits of the molecular stage of emergent advance. If, then, the distinction between resultant and emergent advance be valid, should we not seek to distinguish the factors subtly woven into the " life-history " of a star ? In microscopic detail fresh light is thrown on the concept of emergence as illustrated in the atomic series. And if what Dr. Jeans contends for makes good, it seems that in the central core of a star, and in the filmy structure of a nebula, there are atoms higher in the elemental scale than those of uranium, which stands at the top of the terrestrial series. If this be so, it is in terms of the dissolution of these super-atoms that much of the story of radiation must be re-told.</page><page sequence="32">172 C. LLOYD MORGAN. The question then arises: If we seek to pry back into the very beginnings of cosmic events, are we to start with some highly complex super-atom from which atoms lower in the scale are derivative under dissolution of fellowship; or should we regard the super-atom as itself the product of ascending evolution ? It may be said that of ascending evolution in atoms we have as yet no direct evidence. But it may be that the nature and origin of radiation is such as to enable it to yield direct evidence of dis- solution rather than evolution in the atomic series. I take it that, with respect to our question, the strictly scientific answer is: We do not know. But when we take the next step upwards in our hierarchy, and at each further step onwards, it seems that, on this earth at least, evolutionary ascent in fellowship is in all cases prior to dissolution of fellowship. And if it be said that this earth is only a speck in the cosmic universe, what of that ? It is just in that speck that evolutionary advance to the higher planes of our hierarchy swims into our ken an(d calls for interpretation. What may happen of like order in sundry other specks we do not know. For us, at any rate, our thought of nature is geocentric, if not anthropo- centric, or even ultimately egocentric, in its locus of origin. My aim has been to consider some of the implications of an organic theory of nature. What are they ? Our attention has chiefly been centred in the organism under the expository notion of fellowship. It is an implication of this theory that the plan, the structure, and all the characters of the organism, fall within the comprehensive domain of nature; and that the status of any given organism is determined by the mode of fellowship that obtains therein. We had, however, to advert to the distinction between evolu- tion and dissolution of fellowship. Subject to this distinction, it is not an implication of an organic theory of nature that the status of an organism is wholly the outcome of evolution in modes</page><page sequence="33">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 173 of fellowship. The status of an organism, as things now are, may be the outcome of the dissolution of already existing fellowship. Such, for example, near one end of the scale, may be the status of an atom; such, at the other end of the scale, may be the status, of a man in social regard. In all the more complex organisms evolution and dissolution may proceed side by side in respect of its constituent members. This necessitates the analysis under which anabolic and katabolic processes are distinguished, and the further analysis into the building up and breaking down of the molecules in fellowship within some tissue of the living organism. My reiterated plea is for adequate analysis, followed in due course by synthesis in which we may re-envisage the concrete. Hence we had to draw a distinction between an organism as resultant and an organism as emergent. Resultant advance has long been recog,nized. Emergent advance has only recently received due emphasis at the hands of Professor Alexander, and others. On this type of advance I laid stress when I spoke of the emergent hierarchy. In this section I have tried to show that the distinction between resultant and emergent is not merely whimsical, but is comprehensible in terms of deduction. Have I succeeded in showing that it is not an implication of an organic theorv of nature that all evolutionary advance is of the emergent type ? Have I succeeded in showing that, if this be so, we must disentangle, under analysis, the emergent web from the resultant woof ? No doubt there are difficulties, since certain statistical net-results and mass-effects of emergence seem to be susceptible of deduction on resultant principles. Does not this emphasize the need for fuller and more searching analysis ? Should we not apply such analysis in the field of motives ? Some say that the strongest motive prevails. Apart from the circularity of the statement-for it is said, too, that the prevalent motive is the strongest-is not this tantamount to asserting that all conduct under motive is resultant, and resultant only ? With- p</page><page sequence="34">174 C. LLOYD MORGAN. out denying that there is much which is deducible in human conduct, may not adequate analysis disclose also sundry not- deducible factors of the emergent type ? May we not thus find something new and distinctive of a highly evolved mode of human fellowship-something that could not, as resultant, be predicted from what is given at some lower level of emergence ? Now, frankly admitting that the word " fellowship "-though it is the best I can find-may, perhaps with advantage, be replaced by a better word, I submit that the notion it is intended to express, -does bring out what, for me, is an implication of an organic theory of nature. But it is a notion that is explicative of our extended concept of the organism. It is applicable to organisms in a hierarchical series as emergent. It is applicable also, in a liberal sense, to such a resultant as the solar system. It is applicable to stars, to ant-communities, to human societies, as joint products of evolutionary advance both resultant and emergent. It emphasizes that to which we may give alternative expression when we speak of the organism as a community of members in fellowship, or of fellowship as a characterizing feature of the organism. In this sense, then, an organic theory of nature offers an interpretation of the organism. Is it therefore an implication of such a theory that it deals with organisms only ? For me this is not implied. The theory purports to deal with nature as a whole. If it were one that is concerned with organisms only, would it not follow that nature as a whole is an organism ? But is it, so far as we can form an opinion, an organism ? Are there adequate empirical grounds for entertaining the hypothesis that nature as a whole conforms to our concept of the organism? It is legitimate to apply the notion of fellowship, as character- izing any organism so far as this may be justified by the empirical evidence to hand, and so far as it conduces to further investigation and interpretation. But in practice the noun should be used</page><page sequence="35">A CONCEPT OF THE ORGANISM. 175 with adjectival qualification-atomic, molecular, vital. social, and (I should add) spiritual fellowship. But, so far as I can judge, the empirical evidence up to date does not justify the extension of the notion of fellowship, in the same sense, to the whole of nature. If that be what Holism means, I for one' cannot subscribe to this cardinal article in its creed. Of course it may be said that, throughout nature, each event or cluster of events-and therefore each organism-plays its part in relation to the parts that all others are playing. That is an implication of an organic theory of nature. But. in nature as a whole, are these relations so integrated as to give a com- munity of members in a specific mode of fellowship which we can indicate by the use of a clearly distinguishing adjective ? I leave it in the form of a question. It seems to me that there are some branches of scientific inquiry in which attention is concentrated on the organism in our extended sense of the word. But there are other fields of research where the attention is chiefly directed to the transactions that take effect between organisms. In the former, stress is laid on intrinsic relations within that organism which is selected for special consideration-the molecule, the living cell, and so on. In the latter, extrinsic relations-say, those that obtain when physical influence is transmitted from this organism to that- receive due emphasis. This is, however, only a partial division of labour. One cannot follow the matter up any further in a paper already too long. But it is clear that an organic theory of nature is no respecter of sciences. All furnish grist to its mill. This only need be added. In discussing a concept of the organism and some of the implications of an organic theory of nature, I have tried to steer clear of the implications of any Theory of Reality which may bear on an organic theory of nature, or on which that theory may have bearing. Subject to the</page><page sequence="36">176 C. LLOYD MORGAN. distinction that I drew on p. 154, Creativity should be discussed as an issue beyond the purview of this discussion. For me it is the livest of live issues. But for me its point of insertion is not at this, that, or the other critical turning-point in the emergent hierarchy. If present at all, it is omnipresent. It sheds light on all that generalized science may have to say on an organiic theory of nature and on a concept of the organism.</page></plain_text>
