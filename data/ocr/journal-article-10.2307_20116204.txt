<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID B. HAUSMAN THE EXPLANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR ABSTRACT. If teleological descriptions and explanations are to have a legitimate place in contemporary empirical science, especially as regards biological units in general and even nonbiological ones, then their content must avoid appeal to intentional constituents. Efforts aimed at reducing teleological accounts to nonteleological ones (Braithwaite, Nagel, etc.) have proved unsuccessful (Scheffler). Recently, Larry Wright, building on the work of Charles Taylor, has put together a nonreductive analysis which is free from many of the objections often associated with such a program. I maintain that while Wright and Taylor are on the right track, serious problems still remain for their theories. An analysis is suggested which avoids these difficulties. Presumably not only scientific but also methodological progress was made when Galileo's causal account of the physical universe replaced Aristotle's teleological one. Modern scientists came to realize that even if there were intentions to act and goals for the sake of which we behave as we do, these teleological behaviors were really special causal ones with intentions and ends-in-view as the critical variables. Aristotle's mistake was postulating teleological behavior beyond man and the animals to rocks and planets. But what exactly went wrong here? The mythology is that Aristotle was forced to anthropomorphize these objects in order to secure the intentions necessary to make his claims. Many philosophers in the 20th century, however, are no longer convinced either that it is illegitimate to claim teleological explanations for certain events, even those not involving humans or animals, or that such events require intentions to be considered genuinely teleological. Consider, for example, Robert Brandon's 'Biological Teleology: Ques tions and Explanations'. Here Brandon argues quite forcefully that certain questions of evolutionary biology are teleological: We've all seen either in monster movies or museums the large bony plates along the back of the dinosaur Stegosaurus. The question 'What was that line of bony plates for?' suggests itself. Similarly we wonder about the song of humpback whales, the color patterns of penguins, the lack of leaves in cacti, or the nastiness of rats in crowded conditions. We might verbalize our questions using 'Why,' 'How come,' or 'What for.' I'll refer to such questions as What-for questions. [2, p. 94] Synthese 65 (1985) 327-346. 0039-7857/85.10 ? 1985 by D. Reidel Publishing Company</page><page sequence="2">328 DAVID B. HAUSMAN When a biologist asks a what-for question of some organic feature he postulates that it is an adaptation. [2, p. 102] Put abstractly, a what-for question asked of adaptation A is answered by citing the effects of past instances of A (or precursors of A) and showing how these effects increased the adaptedness of A's possessors (or the possessors of A's precursors) and so led to the evolution of A. [2, p. 103] The sense in which what-for questions and their answers are teleological can now be clarified. Put cryptically, trait A's existence is explained in terms of effects of past instances of A; but not just any effects; we cite only those effects relevant to the adaptedness of possessors of A. [2, p. 103] Brandon's paper puts clearly the contention which I share that there are events which are best described and explained ideologically and which do not require the presence of intentions to make them so. It has been argued, however, that even given the absence of intentions, teleological accounts are nevertheless ultimately reducible in terms of purely mechanistic variables. This controversy began in earnest in 1943 with the publication of Rosenblueth, Weiner, and Bigelow's 'Behavior, Purpose, and Teleology' where it was argued that goal-directed behavior is behavior controlled by negative feedback. While successful criticism of the details of the Braithwaite, et al. analysis has led philosophers in other directions, the belief that a mechanistic reduction of some sort will be successful strongly persists. I hope to show that there is a reasonable methodological alternative to mechanistic reduction of this sort. I propose to do this with a fresh examination of the insight of Charles Taylor into the nature of goal-directed behavior and its further development in the more recent work of Larry Wright. 1. What is at issue is the correct form of scientific explanation for those events truly characterizable as behaviors directed toward a goal. Both Wright and I are impressed by Taylor's insight into the character of goal-directed behavior. Taylor observes that goal-directed behavior occurs for the sake of the state of affairs which follows; it occurs because of what results from it: Now when we say that an event occurs for the sake of an end, we are saying that it occurs because it is the type of event which brings about this end. This means that the condition of the event's occurring is that a state of affairs obtain such that it will bring about the end in question, or such that this event is required to bring about that end. To offer a teleological explanation of some event or class of events ... is, then, to account for it by</page><page sequence="3">THE EXPLANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 329 laws in terms of which an event's occurring is held to be dependent on that event's being required for some end. [10, p. 9] What could be more appropriate than explaining a goal-directed behavior as one occurring because it was required for a certain state of affairs to obtain? And yet this cannot be the whole story. It remains an outstanding question what is to be the status of the state and environ mental variables in these laws. For if these are truly to be laws of nature, as he says, they must be testable. Observations must be made and evidence gathered, and for that we must be able to assess for this or that situation, under this or that set of conditions, whether a behavior is or is not required for a goal to obtain, and then whether in just those cases in which it is required the behavior is forthcoming. Neither Wright nor even Dennis Noble, who makes the role of state and environment the focus of a paper on Taylor, present an accurate assessment of the place of state and environment in the analysis [7]. Of course, Taylor himself is hardly crystal clear even in his direct com ments on the matter: ... the behavior is a function of the state of the system and ... its environment; but the relevant feature of the system and environment on which behavior depends will be what the condition of both makes necessary if the end concerned is to be realized. [10, p. 9] Taylor does complete the picture, if only by implication, in the process of attacking previous efforts to analyze goal-directed behavior [1, 6, 8, 9]. He takes philosophers to task for analyzing teleological systems solely in terms of and thus reducing them to nonteleological mech anisms. First he tells us that ... any given antecedent of B [Behavior] which fulfilled the conditions for the description 'requiring B for G [End]' (let us call this T) would also fulfill some other 'intrinsic' description E. [10, p. 13] Taylor is saying here, of course, in the interval temporally prior to B where the condition requiring B for G is met, the properties and relations which these theorists take to be the sole relevant variables (E) in their laws certainly do obtain. "But," he continues, "this is not to say that J3's occurring is a function of E"s occurring, i.e., that B depends on E.For it may be that in other circumstances a situation which fulfills the description E is not followed by B, the circumstances being precisely those in which the situation does not also fulfill the conditions for the description T; whereas all cases of T may be followed by B." Later he says,</page><page sequence="4">330 DAVID B. HAUSMAN We have no guarantee a priori that we shall discover an 'intrinsic' characterization E which will apply to all cases of T ... and which will never apply to a case which is not followed by B. [10, p. 14] And, indeed, Taylor later goes on to deny it altogether. A diagram will help to simplify matters: T E. . . . .B The relation between T and B is lawful: if jB is a teleological behavior which is exhibited by a system, then for Taylor there is a T such that "if T then B" asserts a law. The relation between T and E is not lawful. Indeed, T may apply when E does or it may not; and T may or may not apply when E does not. It follows that the goal-directed behavior is causally independent of E, and this means that the future states of a teleological system are not determined by "nonteleological" properties and relations. Taylor's official adoption of a position does not actually come until he is finished posing problems for theories which in his view overextend the role of E variables. The major clue towards understanding the details of his final position rests with what must be our own efforts to resolve the tension which exists between his insistence on the causal impotence of E with respect to B, and his earlier r?marks that "... the behavior is a function of the state of the system and... its environ ment." One interpretation of Taylor not only reconciles this disparity but establishes Taylor's theory as a formidable and highly plausible analysis of goal-directed behavior. For certain behaviors B and certain states of affairs G in certain systems, that B is required for G (T) is a relevant variable in a law which links that variable to the performance of B itself. In this way, B and T are like velocity and acceleration with respect to the laws of falling bodies in being relevant variables for determining the future states of the systems in which they interact. As for the determinants of teleological behavior, however, interaction is not limited to these variables alone. Certain specific values and sets of values of state and environment (Taylor's E) are compatible with, respectively, certain specific values and sets of values of B is required for G and (the performance of) B, and some are not. And there are values</page><page sequence="5">THE EXPLANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 331 of E under which T can have no instances at all. As a result, instances of teleological laws when fully spelled out will have as part of their antecedent conditions not only a value of T but also one of the values of E which is compatible with it and B occurring. The statement of the laws themselves must be specific to the particular kind of behavior involved, the kind of state of affairs to be realized, and the E-type conditions under which both T and B will be fulfilled. The form of characteristically teleological laws, as we shall interpret Taylor, may therefore be put as follows: (E &amp; (B is required for G))-&gt; B. Three comments must now be made by way of clarification. First, (letting the designation '_*' stand for a particular value of the variable) that E* is a value of E which together with T* yields B* does not mean that E* itself yields B*. Sometimes when E* obtains B* will be performed and sometimes not. The difference is T*. Second, with respect to each specific value of T, there are an infinite number of values of E which satisfy the law. If the number were finite then it would be possible to form a disjunction of such conditions thereby reestablish ing the direct causal dependence of B on E. Taylor himself sees this point clearly: We have no guarantee a priori that we shall discover an 'intrinsic' characterization E which will apply to all cases of T... and which will never apply to a case which is not followed by B. Of course, we might be able to discover a disjunction of such descriptions, E, F, G, etc., but there is no reason a priori why this list should be finite. A similar objection applies to Nagel's proposed translations. There is no guarantee that a finite list of laws of the form, An-By-Cq, etc., which will cover the phenomena, i.e., enable us to make the predictions which we now make with teleological laws, can be found. Whether this is so or not must be discovered empirically. But if it is not, we cannot be held to have replaced the teleological law. [10, p. 14] Finally, since T* may occur with values of E other than E*, just so long as those other values of E are compatible with T*, there is no way from the absence of any particular value of E alone to say that B* will not occur. All this is by way of saying that while it is a mistake to interpret Taylor as denying a place, even a significant place, for state and environment in his analysis, it would be equally inaccurate to believe of Taylor that he gives them an independent causal role. Taylor believes that a system cannot be governed by nonteleological laws and still be counted as genuinely teleological: Thus the claim that 'the purposes' of a system are of such and such a kind effects the laws which hold at the most basic level. In other words, it is incompatible with the view that the</page><page sequence="6">332 DAVID B. HAUSMAN natural tendency towards a certain condition can itself be accounted for by other laws. Thus the function of an explanation invoking powers or natural tendencies can be precisely to shut off further inquiry. And this is why it is absurd when it is taken as an attempt to state some antecedent. For the fact that a tendency towards a given condition results in this condition neither requires not (sic) admits of further explanation. It is, rather, the break down of such a 'correlation' which stands in need of explanation. And this logical feature of an account in terms of powers which makes it a block to further inquiry is also the one which unfits it to serve itself as an empirical law linking two terms. On the contrary, it can serve only to characterize the type of laws which hold of the system. [10, p. 21] In these passages Taylor clearly identifies teleological behavior as purposive. But the reason he takes this stand is his conviction based on his conception of action, that only where there is purpose do teleologi cal laws have explanatory force [see 3]. In other words, Taylor is prepared to call behavior genuinely teleological only when nonteleological laws are eliminable: Where an account in terms of E is adequate to explain the future states of a system, even if the system were doing what is required to bring about G, it would not be doing it in order to bring about G; it would not be doing it because B is required for G, but because of E. What makes a system teleological is when it is doing what it is doing because it is required. In Teleological Explanations Wright replies against this sort of reasoning. His argument is that there is no good reason to believe that the possibility of giving one sort of account absolutely rules out the other from applying. Why not allow that both accounts are equally explanatory and that it depends on the context as to which is ap propriate to give, the teleological or the nonteleological account? The fact that a true cause/effect relation works, in the sense that a further causal explanation as to why it works (between the requirement and the behavior) is indifferent to why it works that way, does not in the least count against the fact that it does work that way. Wright, of course, has framed these comments from the perspective of his own positive position. Because I reject that position, as well as Taylor's, I am also dissatisfied with his argument. Wright emphasizes that when there is, what he calls, an underlying mechanistic account, it could be invoked in order to explain why the system also behaves in accordance with the teleological principle [10]. But since, as I shall urge, the mechanistic account is part of the analysis of goal-directed behavior itself, there will not be this sense of explanation working. Rather, I believe a working mechanism as Wright describes does not</page><page sequence="7">THE EXPLANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 333 say why a system is teleological, it is part of what it means for it to be teleological. Thus, while I readily accept his comments to the effect that whether one refers to the teleological or mechanistic laws (or causal relations) is a matter of context and not of principle, I would put the following objection in lieu of his reply: If it were true that every case in which a goal-directed behavior seems to occur that it is preceded by the fact that that behavior was required for a certain goal, then to deny a causal relation seems gratuitous. While this exchange anticipates the difference between Wright's analysis and my own, it also points out certain weaknesses in Taylor's antimechanism. Indeed, it is precisely these weaknesses and the fatal problems toward which they lead that directs the major point of departure between Wright and me. I will conclude this section, there fore, with a brief look at one of the problems with the Taylor analysis and I will begin section 2 with Wright's solution. It is Taylor's contention that the occurrence of a goal-directed behavior is to be explained by identifying it as the consequent instance of a characteristically teleological law of nature, and that there are no nonteleological laws of which that behavior could also be an instance and the behavior remain genuinely goal-directed. Specifically, Taylor's conception of characteristically teleological laws calls for a relation between values of E, T, and B such that under some but not all values of E, that T and B can occur in the lawful relation: (E &amp; T)?&gt; B. The problem for the analysis is that where there is no direct lawful relation between values of E and B alone, there is nothing in the analysis which cuts off the compatibility between a given value of E and alternative values of T and B. This in turn creates inconsistency for the analysis itself. Taylor's analysis allows that where it is a law (E*&amp; T*)-^?* it might also be a law (E*&amp;a)^j3. The purpose of the latter notation is to allow our evaluation of two actually separate cases under the same discussion. Thus, where T* is, as always, B* is required for G*, we shall imagine a and ? to vary either as (i) a for L* is required for M*, and ? for L*, or (ii) a for L* is required for G*, and ? for L*. Now because E* is compatible with both T* and</page><page sequence="8">334 DAVID B. HAUSMAN a (since it is compatible with T* and B* occurring and compatible with a and ? occurring), there is nothing to prevent the simultaneous instantiation of both T* and a under the same conditions E*. It follows that since only B* or only ? can actually be performed, that the fulfillment of one law automatically means the violation of another (perhaps an infinite number of others); and that is impossible. It must be concluded, therefore, either that the lawful model for characteristically teleological causal accounts must be given up or that a connection must be drawn directly between values of E and B. The latter instance means introducing a nonteleological as well as a teleological explanatory model for goal-directed behavior. The advantage of this maneuver would be to guarantee specific values of B for specific values of E and so for specific values of T. The details of such an undertaking will be the concern of the final section of this paper where I will present my own analysis of goal-directed behavior. As for the former alternative, giving up the lawful model is the position Larry Wright takes in developing his analysis. 2. Wright and I both agree that Taylor's insight must be preserved, and each of us opposes both the radical mechanism of the reductionists and the radical anti-mechanism of Taylor's final proposal. But Wright denies and I do not that causal relations involving state and environ mental variables (from hereon SE) have a privileged place in the explanation of goal-directed behavior. To avoid the problems faced by Taylor, Wright merely extends what is his conception of causation generally and rejects construing characteristically teleological causal accounts as lawful. Wright puts his analysis, which he calls 'T', succinctly as follows [11, p. 39]: S does B for the sake of G IFF: (i) B tends to bring about G. (ii) B occurs because (i.e., is brought about by the fact that) it tends to bring about G. Apart from its obvious lack of reference to SE variables, two features of this analysis stand out: there is first, Wright's use of the phrase 'tends to bring about,' and second, his use of 'because' which is his indicator of the independence of the analysis from a lawful conception of causation.</page><page sequence="9">THE EXPLANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 335 The question of how Wright understands this because, and the evalua tion of his answer will be my major concern. Before that, however, I shall deal briefly with his use of tends to bring about insofar as he asserts that it is the fact B tends to bring about G which is explanatory of B when S does B for the sake of G. In these passages Wright is analyzing S does B for the sake of G: We might say that the behavior occurred because it is the sort of thing that tends to bring about a certain goal. Or, getting increasingly anthropomorphic, it occurs because it is the right sort of thing to try in these circumstances. The sense of these modifications is sometimes captured by saying that the behavior was appropriate, given the goal, though unsuccessful, inept or even impossible from the outset. In these cases we would say the behavior occurred because it was appropriate for that goal. [teleological behavior] is behavior that occurs because it brings about, is the type of thing that brings about, tends to bring about, is required to bring about, or is in some other way appropriate for bringing about some specific goal. [11, pp. 38-39] As part of the connection between B and G he suggests the relation B is appropriate for Got B tends to bring about G. The difficulty is that the concept is appropriate for, and the rest, are at least as problematic as the notion for the sake of which the analysis is provided. For example, Wright tells us that "In the proper context, it will be obvious to any reasonably experienced observer that jumping over a fence, or, per haps, dashing through a hole in a rock, is appropriate escape behavior, and this is true even if the attempt is unsuccessful..." [11, p. 45]. Wright is, of course, correct about this. But he goes too far. To say jumping over the fence is "appropriate escape behavior" (in the proper context) is at best interpreted as simply another way - perhaps the difference is one of emphasis - of pointing to the fact that the behavior was done in order to escape. What we are noticing is only what we had all along agreed that we could notice, namely when a behavior is being done for the sake of a goal. A goal-directed behavior occurs because it tends to bring about a goal-state. How are we to understand this claim? Wright explains it as follows: ... to say that the train wreck occurred because of the bent rail, to explain the house fire as the result of spontaneous combustion, to say that Johnny caught measles because he was exposed to Jimmy, is not directly to appeal to anything logically inconsistent with any of those things not happening. And this is the sort of explanatory force I take teleological ascriptions to have. [11, pp. 36-37]</page><page sequence="10">336 DAVID B. HAUSMAN To fully appreciate the force of this modification (of Taylor) we need to view the analysis in action. Let's return to the conceptually fertile predator, and this time suppose he is both hungry and thirsty. He does not see any water, but does see something which would pass for prey, and begins manifesting behavior which is, in some obvious sense, stalking. Before catching the prey, however, his stalking leads him to some water, and he pauses in his pursuit to drink. At this point Taylor's formula would require that we say the predator's behavior all along had been directed toward (i.e., for the sake of) obtaining water: Because he was thirsty; and he did just what was required to get water; and, barring interference of the sort Taylor allows, going to water always obtains when it is required to satisfy thirst. [12, p. 209] Wright's analysis handles this case easily: ".... the fact that walking in the direction he did was required to get water was not what caused the predator to stalk in that direction; ..." [12, p. 211]. For Wright it is enough to say why a certain behavior occurs that it was brought about by the fact that it tends to produce a certain goal. By identifying the cause of the behavior we have explained why it occurred, and the explanation is complete. In other words, Wright can consistently maintain that it was B* tending to produce G* which explains B* since it was B* tending to produce G* which caused E* (he was stalking for prey), and it was not the fact that B* also tends to produce M* which explains B* since B* tending to produce M* did not cause B* (he was not looking for water), even though B*'s tending to produce M* sometimes does not cause B*. Thus, while it may be true that B* sometimes occurs because B* tends to bring about M*, nothing need be said about its failure in this case to cause B* for it still to be cogent (1) when it does cause B* that it serve as a complete explanation for B*, or (2) for JB* tending to bring about G* to be the complete explanation of B* when it is the cause of ?*. In the same fashion Wright avoids the problem which so discomfited Taylor's analysis. And no wonder. The charge against Taylor was inconsistency, one component of which was his presumption of the lawful and so invariable occurrence of specific sorts of causes and effects. But Wright does not require either the lawful or the invariable incidence of causes and effects, and so the problems disappear. Where we attacked Taylor's analysis which permitted the simultaneous in stantiation of each of the antecedents of the laws, say, (B* is required for</page><page sequence="11">THE EXPLANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 337 G*)?? B* and (L* is required for G*)-&gt; L*, with only one consequent occurring, Wright simply says: It would be fatuous to deny that Charlie's slamming the window caused the pane to break simply because we cannot say why the other panes in that window did not break. Even if it were completely random which one broke, or how many broke on a hard slam, it is still the slam that causes the breakage,_[11, p. 43] Again, the point is clear. It is a complete explanation of why B* occurred to say what caused B*. In this case B* was caused by the fact that B* tends to bring about G* and so is explained by it. And while the fact that L* tends to bring about G* sometimes causes L*, in this case it did not, and no explanation as to why it did not is relevant to the adequacy of the explanation of why B* occurred. By rejecting the contention that teleological causal relations must be lawful, Wright is able to construct his analysis without including in it, but still making room for, occasional SE causal accounts. But can the relation between the antecedent and the consequent of a teleological explanans be characterized only as causal and not as lawful, and still qualify as scientifically acceptable? I will argue that it cannot. Since the issue hinges on the question of what can or cannot serve as an adequate explanatory model it is worth rehearsing briefly the main features of each model in contention. I have summarized the lawful model, called the covering law model of explanation, elsewhere, essen tially as follows [see 4]: according to the covering law model scientific explanation consists in a deduction of the explanandum from the explanans where the explanans is composed of a statement(s) of a law and a statement(s) of particular conditions. The character of scientific explanation is thus set off from either ordinary or extraordinary sorts of explanation outside of science just because the link between explanan dum and explanans is one of logical inferability and the status of the explanation is this sense conclusive, and because of the requirement that the explanans consist of a statement of an actual law of nature. This differs from Wright's version of the causal model: For he [Taylor] is driven to this formulation [Taylor's lawful account] by a curious and unfortunately widespread prejudice about the nature of explanation, namely, that the explanation of P, the answer to the question, 'Why did P occur?' must itself rule out all alternatives to P; that is to say, the explanation itself must be inconsistent with not-P. This in turn has led to the 'deductive requirement': that part of an explanation be an argument to the effect that P (must) occur. But this is a caricature of our usual explanations.</page><page sequence="12">338 DAVID B. HAUSMAN Explanations of P, answers to the question 'Why did P occur?' invariably presuppose that P did occur, and contain nothing that would count as an argument that P occurred, except very trivial and uninteresting ones. ... In any case, to say that the train wreck occurred because of the bent rail, to explain the house fire as the result of spontaneous combustion, to say that Johnny caught measles because he was exposed to Jimmy, is not directly to appeal to anything logically inconsistent with any of those things not happening. [11, pp. 36-37] I believe Wright and I agree that whatever model of scientific explana tion one adopts, for any given hypothesis to qualify as an explanans it must meet the requirement of being empirically testable. Wright in fact spends considerable time trying to demonstrate that his modification of Taylor generates explanations of teleological behavior which are "empirically demonstrable". I shall argue against Wright that his adoption of a nonlawful conception of causation for teleological explanations precludes their testability and so their acceptability as adequate scientific hypotheses; either that, or in order to secure their testability he is forced to abandon his presumption that they are nonlawful accounts. Normally hypotheses considered as testable in principle must say what would happen if certain conditions had been or were to be met. To be adopted as part of the actual body of scientific knowledge hypo theses must also survive actual testing either directly through straight forward prediction of specific events or indirectly through inference to other hypotheses which are themselves directly tested. Wright's pro posal is that we accept a number of hypotheses of the form "? because B tends to bring aboout G," where such hypotheses are purely explanatory and nonpredictive. Thinking back to a case earlier con sidered, we are asked to accept that B* tends to bring about G* and L* tends to bring about G* could be true simultaneously but that prediction of which B* or L* will occur is not possible. Yet if B* occurs, then ??* tends to bring about G* explains it; and if L* occurs, then L* tends to bring about G* explains it. The question we must pose to Wright is how, in the absence of predictability, were we able to come to accept the causal connection between B* tends to bring about G* and B*, or between L* tends to bring about G* and L*, at all? What justifies in the first place that B* tends to bring about G* is explanatory of B*, or that L* tends to bring about G* is explanatory of L*? Wright attempts to secure testability through the procedure of</page><page sequence="13">THE EXPLANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 339 eliminating alternative explanations [11, pp. 39ff]. An alternative explanation would be a set of variables other than the set constituting the hypothesis relevant to the production of the behavior in question. A successful elimination of alternative explanations, then, would require the elimination of all variables except those mentioned by the hypo thesis as possible causes of the behavior. However, this requires that we be able to distinguish between those variables which are relevant to the outcome and those which are not. The finding-out process this requirement imposes means setting up experiments and varying con ditions, until we have isolated either (i) those variables in whose presence the behavior in question always occurs, or (ii) those variables in whose presence the behavior only sometimes occurs but where the variables involved are still considered causally efficacious on the behavior that emerges. I shall show that what is actually verified in each of these cases is a law, so that the very process of testing to which Wright appeals as the way of isolating the correct explanatory hypothesis depends on our ability to identify those hypotheses as stating laws of nature. Thus, the very possibility of B* tends to bring about G* adopted as explanatory of B* in a particular case, or of L* tends to bring about G* being adopted as explanatory of L* in a particular case, or for that matter, of L* tends to bring about M* as explanatory of L*, and all the others, rests on our ability to identify each pair as being instantiations of laws. What is verified in case (i), those variables in whose presence the behavior in question always occurs, is a law. Should someone object that we might actually have on our hands only an accidental asso ciation, that is so, of course, but quite irrelevant to our present concern. There can never be absolute confirmation of such hypotheses in science to be sure. But the point is that what we have verified in this case, what has been made reasonable to believe given the finite collection of evidence, is that we have a law. It is case (ii), those variables in whose presence the behavior only sometimes occurs, which requires our most serious consideration. From Wright what we have discovered is pre cisely a set of variables which are adequate to explain the event but inadequate to allow a prediction to be made. One is, of course, reminded here of Michael Scriven's famous example: The only cause of paresis is syphilis. But is what we have discovered really a satisfactory explanation of the event in question? The answer is by no means straightforward. Indeed, I believe that the failure to get it straight lies at</page><page sequence="14">340 DAVID B. HAUSMAN the heart of a confusion which has led Wright and others to abandon the lawful analysis of causation. On the one hand, the failure to isolate those variables which would constitute a contingently sufficient condition for the event occurring may be due to imperfect knowledge, our failure either chronic or temporary, to acquire the full information. Then the explanation is not really complete, not really adequate to explain the event occurring; it is simply the best we could do given what we could know at the time. Of course, we may be perfectly willing to accept what we have as an explanation, but only assuming the presence of these as yet unknown factors. It is at least possible in principle, of course, that the missing information will someday be discovered and the explanation filled out, but then the success of the explanation would be due to identifying the events as an instance of a law. On the other hand, there is a possibility that there are no further values or new variables which have an influence on the outcome. The system is under closure and all information is obtained. In just such a case the description we have of initial conditions constitutes a complete description. But then what we have discovered is not a nonlawful causal connection but rather a statistical law. To see this let us recall the condition defining our case (ii): those variables in whose presence the behavior in question only sometimes occurs. The idea is that in trying to eliminate alternative explanatory accounts (Wright's testing procedure), it is necessary that observers be able to distinguish between those variables which are relevant to the outcome and those which are not. But how can this be done when, as in case (ii), they are variables precisely in whose presence the behavior only sometimes occurs and sometimes does not? The answer is that the variables relative to the occurrence of the behavior in question must be in a recognizable pattern of occurrence. If no recognizable pattern were to emerge, then no set of variables could be isolated and no explanans formulated. The point, then, is this. Eliminating alternative explana tions is for Wright what justifies our causal conclusions. This means isolating the conditions which influence the occurrence of the event in question. But such isolation is only possible when there are recogniz able patterns to be discerned. That is, we must be able to determine that the behavior in question turns up with a certain frequency, either qualitatively or quantitatively, among the class of states of affairs in which that event tends to bring about some goal. If we could not make</page><page sequence="15">THE EXPLANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 341 such a determination, we could not establish which variables are relevant and so could not eliminate alternative explanations. But to determine that the behavior turns up with a certain frequency among that class of states of affairs is to justify a statistical law. Wright simply cannot have it both ways. He cannot claim the empirical demonstrability of specific explanations of goal-directed behaviors without having tested these hypotheses as laws. And yet he cannot deny them as laws without denying the possibility of testing. What we have demonstrated, therefore, is that a sharp contrast is to be drawn between, on the one hand, ordinary contexts which are designed for the purpose of communicating to others an understanding of events, thus allowing for the omission of what is not necessary for that particular bit of communication, and scientific understanding on the other. When the concern is scientific, it reveals what it is about the facts which determined that the course of things went this way rather than that, or allows justified predictions to be made from what we know to something we don't. The point is, that the interest of science is one of justification rather than clarification, and of justified prediction rather than simple indication of the future. Finally, we can now see also that Wright's attempt to present the procedure of eliminating alternative explanations as if it were itself an alternative to the method of prediction and falsification or verification as a means of testing hypotheses in science was highly misleading. Where the hypothesis is a law asserted in the form of a universal generalization (case (i)), the testing process becomes nothing more than the process of performing experiments to determine whether the event which the hypothesis says must occur, will occur. Success or failure of prediction is also the way statistical hypotheses are tested (case (ii)). The explanatory hypothesis in statistical explanation, just as for non statistical explanation, is an inductive generalization from a finite number of cases. It asserts, in general, that in the class of all states of affairs of a certain kind, as where B is one of a set of conditions jointly lawfully sufficient for G, that a particular state B will turn up with a certain frequency. While it is true we cannot ever say conclusively that such an hypothesis is verified or falsified, just as we cannot conclusively confirm but can only tend to confirm even universal generalizations, we can tend to confirm or tend to disconfirm statistical ones. Again, this is the very procedure which guides the testing process. As Hempel has stated many times: While it is correct that a statistical hypothesis does</page><page sequence="16">342 DAVID B. HAUSMAN not logically preclude the possibility that the proportion of successes may deviate even significantly from the frequency inferred, it does imply that such departures are highly improbable, so that as the number of cases investigated increases, departures from that frequency will occur at a lower and lower proportion. 3. My analysis of explanation for goal-directed behaviors retains the lawful model of causation; guarantees the integrity of characteristically teleological laws as a nontrivial part of the account; and is one which includes nonteleological laws for the explanation of these behaviors. This puts my effort at odds with Taylor because of the inclusion of standard law, and with Wright for two reasons: first, because it is an account given in terms of laws at all, and second, because it includes as part of the analysis and not just as a contingent truth about some teleological systems that there are nonteleological laws working in such systems. In what follows I will suggest such an analysis and test it against the objection made to Taylor. Let S be a system where each state of S is such that it together with the relevant variables of the environment E and a process law or laws wholly determine the state of S at the next instant. Then for every state Si at time Tt, Si+i is a function of S?Ei as follows: StEi^ Si+i. Further, let 'Gh denote a state of S or E or both S and E at time Th. We shall say S is a goal-directed system if and only if: For some time interval t from T; through Ts where j &lt; k&lt; s, there is a behavior Bk such that (i) Bk is the consequent instance of the characteristically teleological law: (Bk is one of a set of conditions jointly lawfully sufficient for the occurrence of Gs) ?&gt; Bk [from hereon abbreviated to Rks-&gt;Bk]; and (ii) i?fcS?&gt; Bk when and only when S;?;?? Bk. For the time interval t, we shall say that the goal of the system S is Gs. Further, the behavior Bk is said to occur for the sake of that goal. And finally, we shall call any behavior which occurs for the sake of a goal, a goal-directed behavior. Here, I think, we retain the essential feature of Taylor's insight into</page><page sequence="17">THE EXPLANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 343 the character of goal-directed behavior in a scientifically acceptable way without having to abandon the appeal to laws of nature. Running is not one of a set of conditions lawfully sufficient for the rabbit to escape the dog unless the state and environmental variables have a certain value; and if they do have that value, running will be one of a set of conditions lawfully sufficient for the rabbit to escape. While the form of the law is Rks ?&gt; Bk by matter of contingent lawful fact the antecedent is instantiated when and only when a certain set of state and environmental conditions hold, namely, SjEji just those conditions both lawfully necessary and lawfully sufficient for the teleological law to be exemplified. Notice that the relationship which is claimed to exist here between instances of the teleological laws and instances of the nonteleological laws is itself taken to be a lawful one, not a process law to be sure, but rather a law of parallelism [see 5]. By acknowledging this connection to be lawful we are affirming its identity as a contingent but nonaccidental connection, and so denying that the relation is logical or one of analysis. This in turn prevents our construing either sort of law as eliminable. By taking the connections to be a parallelism, we are able to retain for the analysis that a particular instantiation of either the teleological or nonteleological laws makes a decisive difference to the instantiation of the other, and so to the future states of the system. If the teleological account were not what it is, the standard account would not be what it is, and vice versa. It follows that one could in principle base a prediction or offer an explanation solely in terms of the nonteleological law (and knowledge of the appropriate initial conditions). While a value of SjEj is exhibited when and only when Rks, it is also true that "S/E,?&gt;Bk" for the appropriate values asserts a law. Similarly, one could in principle operate strictly within the domain of the characteristically teleological laws. The fact that we are able to identify a behavior as goal-directed without knowing in any precise way the value of the SE variables, a point Wright uses to criticize analyses which include reference to SE laws, is one of the defining features of this analysis.1 To recognize these possibilities of independent prediction and explanation is to make a methodological point and not a metaphysical one in terms of actual eliminability: From the point of view of the analysis neither sort of</page><page sequence="18">344 DAVID B. HAUSMAN lawful account can be collapsed. If this is right, then neither Taylor who denies the possibility of a standard account, nor Wright who denies the need for one are correct. One is reminded here of the claim of the psycho-physical parallelists with respect to the relation between mental and bodily events. While it is characteristic of human beings, they thought, that there exist process laws among mental events, as a methodology it is more effective to work with the process laws governing bodily events. Similarly, the actual determination of the variables for which there are teleological laws of the form R^ ?? Bk may be as illusive, especially for nonpersons, as any of the sort with which Freud was concerned, so that one certainly feels on firmer ground when making predictions of goal-directed behaviors to stick with the laws S7E;?? Bfc. But the claim that there are such laws is supported by our ordinary observations of goal-directed behaviors. In each case just as Taylor insisted and Wright, I think must be committed, there are recognizable patterns where the behavior exhibited resulted from a relation of that behavior to a certain state of affairs; as I have it: from R^. Now is it true, as I earlier forecast, that this proposal avoids the problem which beset the Taylor analysis and which led to its demise? I had argued that Taylor could not support the invariable connection between the antecedents and consequents of specific causal accounts necessary to maintain those connections as lawful. We saw that the analysis left open the possibility of even an infinite number of unfulfilled consequents for every antecedent satisfied. This is not a characteristic of the analysis now under consideration. Where process laws determine the values of future state variables from the values of present state and environmental ones, and where there is a lawful parallelism between the condition of state and environment and the characteristically teleolo gical conditions, alternative sets of teleological antecedents are lawfully ruled out. Thus, for each SE which is exemplified so that the law SE*^&gt;B* is instantiated, there is one and only one exemplification of the teleological antecedent, and so one and only one law of the form Rks~* Bk</page><page sequence="19">THE EXPKANATION OF GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR 345 which is instantiated. This also completely cuts off the possibility of there being instantiated at the same time more than one set of antecedents with the same behavioral component but with different goals. On this analysis the difficulties which plagued Taylor's account have been eliminated. This has been achieved largely by introducing SE laws in a way which avoids the eliminability or logical reducibility of the teleological laws. And all this has been done while still preserving in the analysis the key features of Taylor's insight into the character of goal-directed behavior. NOTE 1 Should some of the teleological laws turn out to be statistical rather than universal, the character of the parallelism would, of course, change. In that case it would take a form roughly as follows: (i) If (Bk is one of a set of conditions jointly lawfully sufficient for Gs) then SjEj with frequency /; and (ii) whenever S?E? then (Bk is one of a set of conditions jointly lawfully sufficient for Gs). The situation is similar in principle to what is needed for the correspondence rules in reducing thermodynamics to mechanics. Notice, too, that if we were to concentrate on the teleological series for the purposes of prediction and explanation, we would need to adopt the apparatus of statistical explanation. REFERENCES 1.
