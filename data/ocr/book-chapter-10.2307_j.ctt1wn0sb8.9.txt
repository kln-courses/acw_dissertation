<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> 5Alfred Döblin’s literary cases  about women and crime  in Weimar Germany Alison Lewis After the First World War, European writers turned increasingly to  consider ation of  social problems in the metropolis, and the impact of  the  war on sexual and mental health more broadly. In particular, the topics of   violence against women, and women who commit violence, which many  writers began to tackle in new ways, proved popular among readers in  Weimar Germany, especially in the cities of  Munich and Berlin. Stories  about real cases were at once frightening and titillating – and for the first  time such stories were readily available, through the diversification of   literary markets, and the plethora of  newspaper and print media that  began to report on contemporary trials and curious cases. Middle-class  and petit-bourgeois publics were keen to consume thrilling and shocking  stories of  crime and sexuality in newspapers and novels. They did so, and  as a result these publics grew more literate and discerning, which in turn  compelled writers to invent novel ways of  presenting the strange but real  cases. On the one hand, authors whose professional lives brought them into  close contact with remarkable real-life cases (of  either sexual deviance or  criminality, or both), found themselves uniquely placed to cater for the  appetites of  these publics. Through writing and publishing case studies  based on their first-hand experience, they were able to capitalise on their  insider knowledge of  crime and the criminal mind. These writers could  easily obtain graphic source material about sensational cases through their  professional associations, and provide additional expert commentary on  well known cases. On the other hand, doctors and judges needed to find  a point of  difference between their kinds of  writing about the criminal  mind and under world and writing by other sources, such as first-person  accounts of  crime authored by con men and criminals themselves. The  experienced writer of  literature with additional expertise in medicine or  the law was undoubtedly better placed to interpret these real-life cases  and to draw general conclusions from them. Yet he or she needed to find  new ways to seize and hold a reader’s attention. This was the conundrum  ∙ 156 ∙ </page> <page sequence="2"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime that aspiring young German writer Alfred Döblin (1878–1957), a medical  practitioner working in one of  Germany’s most seductive and dangerous  metropolises, faced at the beginning of  the Weimar Republic. Born in the seaport city of  Stettin in 1878, Döblin was a resident of   Berlin who trained as a medical practitioner. He had harboured literary  aspira tions from an early age, but suppressed them in order to pursue a  passion for medicine and the natural sciences. Many novelists of  the day,  such as Ernest Hemingway, began their career as newspaper reporters and  strove to replicate the facticity of  newspaper reporting in their literature.  By contrast, while concurrently pursuing a career in medicine, Döblin  indulged sporadically in writing until he first met with commercial success  in 1929 through the publication of  his novel Berlin Alexanderplatz.1 Hence,  it was not to journalism and print media that he turned to articulate his  views on crime and violence – although Döblin did borrow his plots from  the daily press – nor to the many psychoanalytic or medical journals of   the time, but to literature.2 Here it will be suggested that literature provided Döblin (and indeed  others before him, such as Bertolt Brecht and Erich Wulffen) with a  metaphorical laboratory to revel and experiment in. Döblin’s literary  laboratory was not sealed off  from the outside world, like a rarefied scien- tific space, but was an open, public forum that came with an appreciative  audience, and with its own enlightened, educated reading public. This  public was sufficiently distinct from other competing publics represented  by newspaper readers and the like, and to Döblin it must have seemed  advantageous to write for a ‘captive audience’. Specifically, the so-called  objective, empirically based literature of  New Objectivity (Neue Sachlich- keit) in Germany offered Döblin a welcome medium in which to explore  shocking and risqué themes of  the day.  Many of  Döblin’s contemporaries, such as Erich Kästner and Hans  Fallada, sought inspiration in the plethora of  dynamic new urban spaces  and milieus opening up in the cities of  Berlin or Munich – seedy bars,  brothels and alluring cinemas. Others, like Döblin, looked further afield  to underpin their irrepressible flights of  creative fantasy about modern  city life. Döblin valued empirical sources for his stories, but, in addition  to  realistic settings, he chose to draw on the empirical human or ‘life’  sciences for guidance. After all, Berlin was, as Andreas Killen observes,  the ‘breeding ground’ for nervous and mental illness, and for a new  discourse about nervous exhaustion, or neurasthenia.3 With its modern  medicine and unique social welfare system, Berlin provided those writers  like Döblin who practised a profession such as medicine with ample  material to mine. In Berlin Döblin could observe the ‘hidden costs’ of   modern capitalism in the rise of  sexually motivated crimes and modern  pathologies, which were now manifesting not merely as middle-class  problems but as mass social phenonema.4  French writers of  the nineteenth century had already observed that  the modern age urgently needed to anchor its literature in real life and to  ∙ 157 ∙ </page> <page sequence="3"> A history of the cAse study document modern maladies. The sickness of  their era was hysteria and  writers such as Gustave Flaubert plumbed this topic for a voracious reader- ship.5 But by the early twentieth century, bourgeois forms of  cultural  expression needed to adapt in order to contend with newer maladies and  social ills. As the privileged cultural form of  the Bildungsbürgertum, litera- ture faced challenges from many quarters, challenges that an empirical  turn could not adequately address without a more radical reinvention of   the parameters of  literature itself. In the modern metropolis, the writers  of  belles-lettres found themselves faced not only with great complexity  and interconnectivity of  life forms, but with competing and multiplying  forms of  knowledge about these life forms, which must have daunted any  attempt to make sense of  the many innovations in science and the arts.  In style and scope, Döblin’s works have most often been compared to  the high modernism of  James Joyce and the American John Dos Passos.6  A writer of  remarkable diversity and inventiveness, Döblin wrote on an  astonish ing range of  topics, including the Manchu dynasty in China,  the Thirty Years’ War, modern urban life in Berlin, the 1918 November  Revolution and European colonialism. He penned mostly novels as well  as a few dramas, radio plays and dozens of  essays on politics, religion and  art. Although usually grouped under the banner of  modernism, his works  in fact span a number of  quite heterogeneous genres, from historical  fiction, science fiction, travel writing to crime fiction. While such breadth  is possibly less surprising when one considers that Döblin witnessed some  of  the most turbulent decades of  twentieth-century European history,  the scope of  his literary output, which now fills thirty volumes of  ‘selected  works’, is by all standards impressive. He lived through the last years of   the Wilhelminian era, two world wars, the Weimar Republic, National  Socialism, exile in France and the USA, as well as the post-war Federal  Republic of  Germany.  It remains something of  a mystery, therefore, that Döblin, although  critically acclaimed as a writer of  international stature, never achieved  the popularity of  other writers in the modernist canon, most of  whom  who were just as difficult and complex.7 In the Weimar Republic, Döblin  was certainly a prominent figure through his short stories, his journalistic  writings and his many novels – in 1925 Thomas Mann already described  him as ‘one of  our foremost novelists’.8 Actually, few of  his works were  commercial successes until Berlin Alexanderplatz in 1929. Focused on a  factory owner who loses a battle with his competitor, Döblin’s second  novel, Wadzeks Kampf  mit der Dampfmaschine (Wadzek’s Battle with the  Steam Turbine), from 1918, was labelled ‘cubist’ and deemed a critical  failure.9 Döblin was thought to redeem himself  with his next novel,  Wallenstein, a grand anti-war epic in two volumes, which went into a  second print run.10  To be sure, Döblin was fortunate to have secured the support of  an  influential publisher in Samuel Fischer, who published his first work,  in 1916 – about the Wu-wei resistance movement, Die drei Sprünge des  ∙ 158 ∙ </page> <page sequence="4"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime Wang-Lun (The Three Leaps of  Wang-Lun) – and subsequent novels until  1933. Döblin was in good company, since S. Fischer was also the publishing  house of  Germany’s two other great writers of  the era, Gerhart Haupt- mann and Thomas Mann. But unlike Hauptmann, who had been awarded  the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1912, and Mann, who was its recipient  in 1929, Döblin’s fame was largely limited to Germany. Throughout his  career he lived very much in the shadow of  his two literary forebears.  When he found himself  struggling to pay the rent in exile in Los Angeles  as the Manns were preparing to build a palatial residence on the Riviera,  he was reminded once again that he was, by comparison with Mann, only  a middling writer.11 Alfred Döblin, realism, naturalism and modernism Döblin’s strongest literary influences were undoubtedly the great French  realists of  the nineteenth century, and the Berlin naturalists Hauptmann  and Wedekind. And yet, in the 1930s, when Döblin was admitted into  the canon of  world literature, taking his place alongside Joyce and Dos  Passos, it was not as a realist or naturalist but as a moderniser and  modernist.12 Hence in German literary circles Döblin is rarely compared  to his French literary forebears Gustave Flaubert, Honoré de Balzac and  Émile Zola. This is curious, all the more so since Döblin proclaimed once  in 1924 that the modern ‘European-American world’ was on the cusp of   a naturalist age.13  Among French literary historians, German naturalism is often regarded  as an imitation of  French naturalism, which was superseded by symbol- ism and a new ‘nervous romanticism’. In a recent revision of  this idea,  Stéphane Michaud has argued in favour of  seeing classical works of   German modernism by Musil and Döblin as the legitimate heirs to French  naturalism.14 Alternatively, we could view expressionism, the successor  to naturalism, as does Richard Heinrich, as a ‘naturalism of  nerves’.15  Richard Daniel Lehan goes further, proposing that the literary modes of   naturalism and realism were the crucial ‘vortex through which the novel  passed’ across Europe and the Americas for 100 years. Both naturalism  and realism represent a ‘powerful way of  seeing the physical world’  that responded to large-scale social changes.16 Naturalism, for instance,  can be considered a response to Darwinian theories of  heredity and  the environment ‘that would ground the literary work in a factual and  scientific context’.17 Indeed, in Germany naturalism was far from dead at  the turn of  the century; it was being rei nvented through the discipline of   psychology. Naturalism’s focus on heredity and degeneration was being  replaced by an intense interest in human desire and the social determin- ants of  human actions.18 Döblin’s work demonstrates that naturalism  found a new expedient ally in the medical, legal and psycho analytic case  history – that most empirical of  new-found genres – thus prolonging the  ∙ 159 ∙ </page> <page sequence="5"> A history of the cAse study life of  the naturalist spirit in global literature well beyond its heyday in  the Second French Empire. The diversity of  Döblin’s output has posed a challenge to scholarship.  His oeuvre is most commonly linked to Brecht’s innovations in epic theatre,  especially since several of  his major novels present epic treatments of   grand historical themes. A feature of  his approach to historical topics is,  like Brecht’s, his sympathy with the powerless masses of  history.19 Closely  related to this is another of  his major concerns, namely with the harsh  realities of  modern urban life as experienced through various low-life or  lower-class characters – criminals, prostitutes and working-class figures.  But unlike Brecht, Döblin chose the medium of  the novel to develop these  themes rather than drama, and in doing so was possibly overshadowed  by other great masters of  the modern novel of  the time in Thomas Mann  and Robert Musil. Berlin Alexanderplatz, written in the middle of  his career, appears to  stand across both strands of  his writing: it manages to bring Döblin’s  fascination with the anonymous masses in history together with his keen  interest in exploring individual psychology. Although its title suggests an  epic treatment of  a contemporary theme, the novel focuses on the fortunes  of  a recently released criminal, Franz Biberkopf, and is set on the fringes  of  the underworld of  Berlin’s teeming metropolis of  the 1920s, with which  Döblin was only too familiar from working with social welfare patients.  Döblin develops a distinctive aesthetics of  empathy for the ‘small man’  in this work, which was to augur well for the novel’s positive critical  reception at the time and in later years. A pivotal stage in the development  of  the writer’s avowed sympathies for the lower middle classes – which he  shared with contemporaries like Kästner and Brecht but not with Musil or  Mann – is a far less well known work, from 1924, Die beiden Freundinnen  und ihr Giftmord (Two Girlfriends Commit Murder by Poison).20 This earlier  work, so modest that it is often omitted from surveys of  Döblin’s oeuvre, is  a case study that combines medical and legal traditions of  case writing. It  is this work, it will be argued, that plays a crucial role in the development  of  Döblin’s specific brand of  literary modernism.  These two literary works, which are both indebted to the case study  genre, stand in a complex dialogic relationship to the newer styles of   modernism and the older modes of  naturalism and realism. In many  ways, Döblin’s works from this period of  transition deserve Heinrich’s  epithet of  a sort of  ‘naturalism of  the nerves’. Döblin is often thought to  belong to the camp of  left-leaning modernist writers, such as Brecht, who  responded to the crisis of  individualism by advocating a revival of  epic  traditions in prose and drama.21 Scholarship has tended to stress Döblin’s  break with nineteenth-century realism and present his later works as a  modernist breakthrough to a new anti-realist style. These classifications  capture part of  the story of  Döblin’s massive oeuvre; however, they fail  to account adequately for the innovations Döblin made in documentary  realism, or, more accurately, in criminal or medical realism.  ∙ 160 ∙ </page> <page sequence="6"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime The case study genre can be shown leading the charge in innovating  around the conventions associated with realism and naturalism. Rather  than abandoning the realist traditions of  the nineteenth century, through  his case studies of  ordinary working-class men and women situated on the  fringes of  respectable society (and with one foot in the criminal under- world), Döblin sharpens the tools in the traditional realist tool box. He  does so by incorporating into his largely realist handiwork new medical,  sexological means, as well as psychoanalytic instruments and knowledge.  He also modernises the literary tools in the naturalist kit, applying the  insights of  the medically trained observer of  sexual pathologies to real- life murder cases.  It was arguably the case study’s emphasis on the individual, and his  or her inner life driving social behaviour, especially its extremes such as  murder and violence, that was to exert a decisive influence on Döblin’s  literary production. Moreover, the traditions of  medical and criminologi- cal case writing were to inform Döblin’s approach to literature at a crucial  time in his development as a writer, eventually pushing him further in the  direction of  a forensic type of  socially engaged modernism that is epito- mised in Berlin Alexanderplatz. In Döblin’s early historical epics, his focus  was more on crowd psychology and behaviour than on the individual.22  In his futurist work from 1924, Berge, Giganten und Meere (Mountains,  Seas and Giants), we can already see the beginnings of  a more pronounced  shift towards the individual. More so than this novel, however, it is a much  shorter one that seems to hold the key to his aesthetic breakthrough, his  true crime novel and medical case study of  heterosexual and homosexual  relationships, Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord. A direct line  can be traced from this work to Döblin’s masterpiece of  modernism in  Berlin Alexanderplatz. Reading Döblin through the prism of  the genre  of  the case study thus makes possible a more nuanced interpretation of   his relationship to the two major literary modes of  the time, realism and  modernism. In addition, it facilitates revision of  prevailing conceptions  of  the relationship between progressive politics and modernism. It can be  shown that Döblin’s experiments with the case study genre were unthink- able without his expert training in and first-hand knowledge of  medicine. With his mother, Sophie, and four siblings, Döblin had moved to  Berlin in 1888, after his womanising and occasionally violent father,  Max Döblin, had abandoned the family. As the second youngest sibling,  Alfred Döblin was the only member of  his immediate family to complete  secondary school and enter university; like other writers of  his time,  such as  Gottfried Benn and Arthur Schnitzler, Döblin undertook medical  training. From an early age, he harboured literary aspirations while  continuing to further his medical training and to establish his career as  a medical practitioner and later as a psychiatrist. Döblin’s first tentative  attempts at writing literature began around 1900, when he was student  of  medicine in Berlin and Freiburg. His first two novels were written  during this time, the second one finding a publisher only much later, in  ∙ 161 ∙ </page> <page sequence="7"> A history of the cAse study 1919, when it was published under the title Der schwarze Vorhang (The  Black Curtain). After completing his medical training, Döblin worked in  various psychiatric clinics, spending a year in Regensburg and two years  in Berlin-Buch, and gained further experience in Berlin hospitals, such  as the Charité and the municipal Hospital Am Urban, where he met his  future wife.  Döblin’s friendship with editor, art critic and fellow Jewish writer  Herwarth Walden dates from the time of  his undergraduate medical  studies. When Walden launched the Der Sturm (The Attack) in 1910, first  a monthly periodical and later a gallery that served as a launching pad for  expression ism, fauvism, cubism and the futurists, Döblin was one of  its  ardent supporters. Döblin had yet to publish a full-length novel when the  First World War intervened and he was enlisted as a military doctor. In  1916 his first novel, Die drei Sprünge des Wang-Lun, appeared while Döblin  was still stationed in Saargemünd in Alsace-Lorraine, France. Hailed as  a breakthrough in the novel format, the work was a critical success and  was even translated into French. However, as he remarked, in the early  years there was little or no prospect of  making a living from his literature.  Döblin does not appear to have regarded his medical and neurological  training as anything more than a means to secure a living, and one  ind ependent from his hobby of  writing literature. This is not to say  that Döblin was not passionate about his medical work and research.  He confessed, when reflecting on his life: ‘medicine and science had an  extraordinary hold on me’.23 In one autobiographical sketch, he describes  spending years of  his life, presumably between 1905 and 1911, ‘wandering’  around mental asylums, evading ‘the struggle for so-called existence’.24  He felt strangely comfortable in the company of  the mentally ill, he  recalls, and alongside plants, animals and stones claims he tolerated only  two types of  humans: children and the mad.25 Döblin wrote his dissertation on alcohol-induced memory disorders  under psychiatrist Alfred Erich Hoche in the years prior to the outbreak  of  the war. Döblin’s lifelong mission to illuminate the causes of  mental  illness, which was later to drive his forays into literature, stems from  his time conducting medical research: ‘the darkness that surrounded  these sick people was what I wanted to help to illuminate’.26 According  to Döblin, his pre-war years spent in psychiatric clinics eventually led  him to turn away from conventional psychiatry and to seek answers in  the field of  internal medicine. Through the work of  Berlin’s Institut für  Sexualwissenschaft (Institute for Sexual Science) he inevitably became  familiar with the latest theories on the ‘inner secretions’, or hormones. In  his words, ‘you had to get inside the physiological, not inside brains, but  maybe inside the glands, the metabolism’.27 After Vienna and Zurich, Berlin was rapidly becoming the third major  centre for psychoanalysis.28 Working in Berlin’s large clinics brought  Döblin into direct contact with many of  the city’s sexologists and  psychoanalysts, who, under Karl Abraham, were to form the Berlin  ∙ 162 ∙ </page> <page sequence="8"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime Psychoanalytic Institute in 1923.29 Where Döblin writes that Sigmund  Freud’s theories were no revelation to him – ‘Freud was not a revelation  to me personally’ – this indifference must be taken with a healthy grain  of  salt. No doubt representing an underestimation of  Freud’s impact on  himself, Döblin’s claim possibly says more about Freud’s pre-eminence  in the field of  psychoanalysis at the time.30 Psychoanalytic theories that  were being formulated and tested in Berlin’s hospitals and talked about in  the newspapers were even dismissed by some as a ‘craze’.31  By his own admission, Döblin was anything but indifferent to this craze  of  psychoanalysis: in 1928 he describes himself  possessing a ‘great sensi- tive receptivity, an exceptional capacity for analytical insight namely  in the direction of  the psychic-unconscious’.32 When professing in the  same sketch to have been more influenced by physiology and neurology  than by psychoanalysis, he merely seems to be indicating his preference  for physical, somatic and neurological explanatory models of  mental  illness over purely psychological ones. Like most traditionally trained  psychiatrists of  the time, he had been schooled in the neurological and  physiological determinants of  mental illness, but in the post-war years  he had increasingly engaged with a whole range of  newer psychoa nalytic  ideas.  Döblin first became interested in psychoanalysis around the time he  started working as a doctor in his own practice for social welfare cases.  After the First World War and moving his practice to the city’s eastside, to  340 Frankfurter Allee in Lichtenberg, he proceeded to train as an analyst  in the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute under the guidance of  Ernst  Simmel. He went on to join Abraham’s reading group and encountered  Erich Fromm, Wilhelm Reich and Melanie Klein.33 Döblin shared the  social and political concerns of  the Institute and became a member of  the  Verein Sozialistischer Ärzte (Association of  Socialist Doctors), through  which he came into contact with the work of  Magnus Hirschfeld’s Institut  für Sexualwissenschaft.  His profound and, as suggested in his memoir, almost uncanny ability  to plumb the depths of  the psyche’s unconscious proved a particular  asset in Döblin’s first explicit experiment with a medical topic, in Die  beiden Freund innen und ihr Giftmord. Because he was trained in many new  empirical and clinical disciplines it seemed only natural to Döblin to try to  tap into these insights, and to conjoin his two passions in life. His expert  medical knowledge could form the basis for experimenting with new forms  and styles of  writing and allow him to indulge his latest interest. Like Gottfried Benn, Döblin writes about the split in his life between  litera ture and medicine. In the fashion of  the period, he regarded both  activities as evidence of  the unifying entity of  the individual genius,  although Döblin never expressed the relationship in these terms.34 At the  heart of  Döblin’s dualism is, of  course, the myth of  two cultures – that  which C. P. Snow famously called the myth of  two opposing cultural  spheres.35 Despite his expertise in both medicine and the arts, Döblin  ∙ 163 ∙ </page> <page sequence="9"> A history of the cAse study always felt an uneasy tension between his work as a doctor and his  en deavours as a writer. In two essays from 1927, ‘Der Nervenarzt Döblin  über den Dichter Döblin’ (‘The Nerve Doctor Döblin on the Writer  Döblin’) and ‘Der Dichter Döblin über den Nervenarzt Döblin’ (‘The  Writer Döblin on the Nerve Doctor Döblin’), he writes about the odd  relationship between the two different aspects of  his life. Not only does  Döblin the doctor claim to barely ‘know’ Döblin the writer, he maintains  that his literary works are ‘completely foreign to me and I am also com- pletely indifferent to them’.36 The doctor side of  himself  does not share  the political views or the tastes in literature of  his writer self. Döblin the  writer, however, appears to have a far better relationship to his namesake  in Döblin the doctor, and is at least curious to learn more about the life  of  a doctor, even to exploit it, if  only to find source material for use in  his writing. The split between Döblin’s two passions in life is presented  less in psychological than in sociological terms, and offers a commentary  on the increasing specialisation of  knowledge in the modern world. The  writer is an individualist and a generalist, while the doctor is nothing out  of  the ordinary, a ‘grey soldier in a quiet army’, and a specialist.37 Yet  Döblin the writer has an inferiority complex with regard to Döblin the  doctor: ‘I have defects, probably complexes, and the practised doctor  probably sensed something’.38 Despite the writer’s greater fame, he feels  defensive towards the doctor, as if  intimidated by the knowing gaze of   the psychiatrist, whereas the Döblin the doctor is unashamed of  his  ignorance of  literature. From this exchange, it is not hard to adduce the  crisis of  dominant literary systems of  knowledge. Discussing the viability  of  writing literature in an essay titled ‘Ökonomisches aus der Literatur’  (‘Economic Observations from the Literary Sphere’), Döblin complains  bitterly that, despite having published ten books, and selling 6,200 copies,  in 1924 he had hardly earned more than 400 Reichsmark per month. He  does admit, however, that his ‘criminal case’ of  the two women who tried  to poison their husbands sold 3,000 copies and, over the two years 1924  and 1925, earned him a total of  1,200 Reichsmarks.39 Criminology and sexology in the literary case study Döblin wrote his novella Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord for  a new series of  crime stories based on real criminal cases. His friend  Rudolf  Leonhard was keen to commission stories for a new publisher in  Berlin, Die Schmiede, and called his series ‘Außenseiter der Gesellschaft:  Die Verbrechen der Gegenwart’ (‘Outsiders in Society: The Criminals  of  Today’). Döblin was to write the first work in what the editor hoped  would become a lucrative new series. From Döblin’s perspective Die beiden  Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord combined a number of  his professional and  personal preoccupations, which he subjected to a new documentary style  of  treatment. He took a real criminal case as his material, borrowed  ∙ 164 ∙ </page> <page sequence="10"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime extensively from journalistic and legal sources and, for embellishment,  drew on his medical expertise and his personal experience. Döblin was  interested in questions of  sadomasochism, madness, sexually motivated  violence and female sexuality, and the real criminal case involved all of   these themes. From his autobiographical writings it is clear that Döblin  also had personal experience of  the toll that an abusive marriage could  take on women. His sister Meta, who was tragically killed by shrapnel  during the attempted November Revolution in Lichtenfelde in 1919,  had suffered terribly at the hands of  her husband, who, according to  Döblin, had married her only for her dowry. ‘It was a terrible marriage’,  he writes.40 Döblin’s novella centres on a famous legal case from 1923 concerning  a woman who poisoned her husband out of  love for another woman. Ella  Klein and Margarete Nebbe were brought to trial in Berlin for attempting  to murder their husbands by poisoning them with arsenic, and their  trial touched a raw nerve with readers of  the time. Like so many of  his  contemporaries, Döblin was fascinated and scandalised by the emergence  of  a new type of  female criminal, and the spectre of  the ‘female poisoner’,  a phenomenon that Wulffen explored in his popular study Psychologie  des Giftmords (1917). It reminded him of  his sister and the abuse she had  suffered, which might easily have escalated into a murder, had she not  died during the November Revolution. Döblin recognised the potential of   the criminal case for a wider readership, whose fears and anxieties about  female sexuality had already been well nurtured by publications such  as Richard von Krafft-Ebing’s sexological study Psychopathia Sexualis  (1886), Oskar Panizza’s satires and Erich Wulffen’s handbooks for lawyers  and doctors Das Weib als Sexualverbrecherin (1923) and Psychologie des  Verbrechers (1906, reissued 1908). The Klein–Nebbe case had been sensa- tionalised in the print media in Berlin and the rest of  Germany, and taken  up by the international press as well. In addition to tackling the issue of   the female criminal, it had the added intrigue of  female homosexuality,  or inversion, along with another modish topic of  the day, the ‘perversion’  of  sadomasochism. Despite having changed the names of  the main characters – Ella  Klein becomes Elli Link and Margarete Nebbe becomes Margarete (Grete)  Bende – Döblin’s novella is highly realistic and almost documentary in  style. Readers contemporary with Döblin would have been familiar with  the real court case from the extensive press coverage, and most would  certainly have seen the novella as an exposition of  the Klein–Nebbe  murder case. Appearances are, however, deceptive, because in the novella  the case is carefully crafted, or rather, woven from a bricolage of  diverse  source material, some medical and psychoanalytic, some journalistic.  On one level, the fictionalised case study composed by Döblin evokes the  traditions of  legal and medical-forensic case reporting that emerged over  the course of  the eighteenth century as part of  a new ‘forensic dispositif ’  made possible by new testing possibilities, the results of  which could be  ∙ 165 ∙ </page> <page sequence="11"> A history of the cAse study deployed as evidence in trials.41 Increasingly throughout the nineteenth  century, specialist medical knowledge became a topic of  interest for a  general reading public. In the eighteenth century, the Pitaval tradition  of  crime writing had already made sensational criminal court cases ac- cessible to a lay reading public, and as middle-class publics expanded  over the course of  the nineteenth century so did the level of  awareness of   criminality and pathology, as well as competency in reading such cases.  This was partly because in Germany after 1850 legal trials were opened  to the public and newspapers were able to report cases of  interest with  greater fidelity. Moreover, literary writers were – with permission of  the  court – able to gain access to court materials and ground their own crime  narratives in more reliable sources of  empirical evidence, such as evidence  presented at trials, as well as expert witness statements.42 With the advent  of  psychoanalysis, and of  sexological theories about ‘deviant’ sexual  behaviour in the twentieth century, the forensic dispositif  came to focus  on the criminal and her state of  mind. By the time of  the Klein–Nebbe  trial, the courts deployed state-of-the-art medical evidence, often from  competing areas within the same discipline, thus from all branches of   forensic medicine, neurological psychiatry, sexual medicine and psychol- ogy. Of  all the schools of  psychiatry, however, the newer discipline of   psychoanalysis was the least well represented in court cases.43 This lack  of  presence during trials can be explained by the fact that institutional  acceptance of  psychoanalysis developed slowly and with difficulty; this  process was shaped by mutual disregard between the practitioners of  the  court and psychoanalysts, as explored in Chapter 4. Döblin’s literary case writing in Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr  Giftmord is so faithful to the real case that it is hard to imagine he was  not present during the five days of  the Klein–Nebbe trial in March 1923.  Yet all indications are that he was most likely not present, nor was he an  expert witness during the trial, although he knew the doctors who had  treated Willi Klein and he had spoken to Ella Klein and Nebbe.44 Döblin  did, however, possess a copy of  the Anklageschrift, the formal indictment  which summarises the court proceedings, and was also familiar with the  medical expert witness statements provided by sexologist and psychia- trist Magnus Hirschfeld, and two others, Otto Juliusberger and Friedrich  Leppmann. Döblin’s other main textual source is the comprehensive  newspaper coverage of  the trial over those five days; the reports were  published in the morning and evening issues of  virtually every national  and regional newspaper in Germany.  Döblin’s literary case study appears to be a good demonstration of  the  modernist aesthetics of  New Objectivity, which aimed to move literature  away from conventional psychology and closer to the human and empiri- cal sciences, to be more documentary in style and to be a form of  ‘factual  fantasy’ (‘Tatsachenphantasie’).45 Read as an elaboration of  a criminal  case, Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord actually belongs to a much  older tradition of  crime writing.46 With its focus on the criminal, Döblin’s  ∙ 166 ∙ </page> <page sequence="12"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime story is typical of  much of  the crime writing that newly emerged from the  second half  of  the nineteenth century onwards.47 In the vein of  a criminal  case study, the novella seeks to present a specific example (‘Beispiel’) of   a more general human condition. Yet this instance is not offered as an  exemplar, nor as an illustration of  a norm or a point of  law, nor even of   a pathological condition in the usual way of  criminal cases.48 Rather, it  might be considered a concretisation of  critic André Jolles’s simple form  of  the Kasus, the universal form that discusses a criminal event in the  context of  a deviation from moral or legal norms. In Jolles’s schema of   ‘simple’ literary forms, the function of  the Kasus is to pose questions  and weigh up norms of  social behaviour.49 Akin to the riddle, which is  a question begging an answer, the Kasus poses a moral question via the  crime, which often it can only partially answer – frequently by asking  further questions. Döblin’s story also appears to have much in common  with legal and medical case writing, namely in the relationship between  the specific instance and the general rule or hypothesis that the case seeks  to extrapolate from the example. While the specific modality of  this  relationship can vary, the general can be inferred from the specific case in  inductive forms, or prior to it in deductive forms, or simultaneously when  interpretation and representation of  the case coincide.50 The romantic,  realist and modernist case of  the nineteenth and twentieth centuries gave  preference to the inductive method over the deductive.51  In writing Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord Döblin relies heavily  on the Anklageschrift and the newspaper reports from a host of  Berlin  newspapers.52 These sources all reported on the content of  the 600 letters  exchanged by Klein and Nebbe, and Döblin uses these letters as well. In  a rather reductive fashion that was characteristic of  newspaper writing  of  the time, the papers classified the women according to common gender  stereotypes of  the sadistic, hysterical, unscrupulous woman, and the  cold, calculating and inhuman perpetrator.53 The Berliner Lokalanzeiger  speaks of  two ‘dehumanised women ... who wanted to divest themselves  of  their husbands, who had become a hindrance to them in their abnormal  relations hip to one another through the unscrupulous, cold and calculat- ing usage of  poison’.54 The demonisation of  both women in the press  is only slightly mitigated by witnesses who recounted Klein’s abusive  marriage and Willi Klein’s alcoholism. This was a small detail that might  have gone unnoticed by most readers, but it struck a chord with Döblin,  and was to become the centre-piece of  his literary treatment of  the trial. The main change that Döblin makes to extant accounts of  the trial  is to shift the focus from the inner, psychic realm of  the criminal – the  principal focus of  the newspaper reports – to the space in-between, the  intersubjective space between the two women and their conflicts.55 This  innovation enables Döblin to break down the impression that there is a  direct, causal link between crime and criminal agent, and perhaps also  to deflect attention from the known fact that the actual murder was  patently planned. Döblin’s other main innovation is to introduce into his  ∙ 167 ∙ </page> <page sequence="13"> A history of the cAse study novella the concept of  the unconscious. This concept had become one of   his burning obsessions, and he presents it at the start of  his own thinly  fictionalised causal chain of  events, thereby portraying his characters  as figures in a complex game of  psychical processes. For Die beiden   Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord Döblin makes a second shift of  emphasis in  relation to the case: he intertwines psychological and social causes so as to  make each one highly dependent on the other. This sets his account apart  from those in the press. He thereby presents the crime as the result of  an  almost unfathomable confluence of  social and psychological factors and  conscious and unconscious motives.  Döblin’s case writing is deeply experimental, and he seems to have  been unsure of  how to achieve the desired realistic effect and of  how to  acknowledge the many baffling aspects of  the case. This uncertainty leads  him to restate his argument several times within the one work, through  the use of  slightly different components, published in the original version  of  Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord. The story of  the murder is  supplemented by non-literary and para-literary material, which have  largely perplexed critics. At the end of  the largely realistic narrative of  the  case appears a short epilogue with a commentary by the author. Following  the epilogue are two one-page, illustrated analyses of  the handwriting  of  each woman, ‘Zu Ellis Handschrift’ (‘On Elli’s Handwriting’) and ‘Zu  Margaretes Handschrift’ (‘On Margarete’s Handwriting’). As well, at the  close of  the volume of  the first edition of  1924, and only in this edition,  Döblin included an unusual psychiatric addendum, or afterthought to  his narrative. Unbound from the text of  the novella, and inserted in an  envelope glued inside the back cover, the addendum presents a series of   psychoanalytic diagrams, printed in colour on ten glossy pages DIN 476  in size. These diagrams represent a further illustration of  the case, but in  a specialist language and a non-discursive form. Given the title ‘Räum- liche Darstellung der Seelenveränderung’ (‘Spatial Representation of  the  Changes to the Soul’), the addendum comprises seventeen visualisations  and two graphs.  Simply by virtue of  these heterogeneous components of Die beiden  Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord as first published, Döblin’s literary case  study is an anomaly. No doubt it was an indulgence on the part of  the  publisher, Die Schmiede, and his friend Rudolf  Leonhard, who edited the  series, to publish it in this form, which is conceivably why the diagram- matic addendum was not included in subsequent editions of  the work.  The end effect of  the first edition is that Döblin rather overstates the  intricacies of  his interpretation of  the Klein–Nebbe murder case; in  other words, the impact of  the additional, non-literary adjuncts is to  overdetermine the myriad causal factors leading to the crime. In the  literary narrative Döblin points to various causes of  the murder, such as  the lesbian relationship between Elli Link and Grete Bende, the violent  and loveless marriages, the choice of  rat poison, the psychology and  pathology of  the characters, each playing a role in the eventual crime  ∙ 168 ∙ </page> <page sequence="14"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime of  murder. Still, Döblin appears to think that his literary account of  the  case is insufficient, and with the addendum he decides to embellish it in  formal, aesthetic terms. By embroidering the literary case study, adding  extra-literary elements such as the epilogue and then the addendum,  however, Döblin risks staging the case in several discrete acts.56 In each of   these acts, he tries to elucidate the aetiology of  the crime, with the help  of  distinct discursive formations.  In the literary sections Döblin provides his own aetiology of  the  case, stressing causal factors such as infantilism, homosexuality and the  brutality of  Elli Link’s husband.57 In the first chapter of  the narrative,  the story of  Elli Link and her abusive relationship with her husband is  narrated; the second chapter tells of  the lesbian relationship between  Elli Link and Grete Bende, and their plot to kill their husbands. Finally,  Döblin concludes with a summary of  the findings of  the trial and the  verdict. Yet unlike the court reporters, Döblin is at pains to offer a  sympathetic and impartial account, while censoring much of  the original  evidence produced at the trial. The court transcripts are full of  explicit  statements taken from the letters. By contrast, Döblin softens his account  of  Ella Klein/Elli Link’s suffering, bringing his story back to this figure  as a casualty of  marital abuse. An important subtext to Döblin’s version  is that the husband of  Ella Klein/Elli Link belongs to the large army of   war-damaged and traumatised veterans from the First World War. He  is one of  the shell-shocked, unable to live up to ideals of  masculinity,  and doomed to repeat his wartime trauma in acts of  senseless violence  directed against his wife.  Döblin’s account, however, never imparts the full details of  the hus- band’s past and his suffering during the war; instead, Döblin alludes  to this in Willi Link’s alcoholism and unmotivated violence. Rather,  Elli Link is his main focus of  attention, as she becomes the victim of   a violence that is all-pervasive in society, and that emanates, as sexolo- gists said it would, from damaged returned war veterans, who cannot  distinguish between the war front and the home front. Elli Link is more  victim than villain in Döblin’s account, and the mitigating circumstances  Döblin builds into his story point to an important function of  his case  study. The writer’s aim is to humanise the criminal rather than diagnose  her or him, and thus to elicit some sympathy and understanding for the  plight of  Elli Link. Hence at the level of  plot, the narrative is preoccupied with the psycho- sexual dynamics of  Elli Link’s marriage – described from the perspectives  of  both wife and husband – and the plan to murder Elli Link’s husband,  while the trial and the time in jail are given comparatively little coverage.  The language used throughout is literary in the broadest sense, neither  strictly medical nor psychoanalytic, although it is replete with allusions  to common psychoanalytic terminology of  the day. For instance, when  referring to the work of  the unconscious, Döblin uses the word unter- irdisch (subterranean). While the behaviour and actions of  his characters  ∙ 169 ∙ </page> <page sequence="15"> A history of the cAse study are clearly viewed through the lens of  medical knowledge, Döblin’s craft  is purely literary. Döblin’s newest passion for psychoanalysis proves to have been the  most significant additional influence on Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr  Giftmord. Ernst Simmel, Döblin’s mentor, had experimented in treating  war trauma and neuroses – he had been posted in East Prussia during the  war as a military doctor. Döblin would have been familiar with Simmel’s  publications on the topic.58 Through his other contacts with the Berlin  Psychoanalytic Institute, Döblin was exposed to a wide range of  psycho- analytic theories and case studies. The main traces of  psychoanalysis in  Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord are evident in Döblin’s handling  of  unconscious matter. This can be seen in sections of  the novella itself,  but also in the schematic addendum, the ‘Räumliche Darstellung der  Seelenveränderung’. In the literary case study, Döblin alludes in general  terms to that which Döblin the doctor, following the lead of  Freud, would  probably call the unresolved Oedipal complexes of  Elli Link and Grete  Bende.59 In Döblin’s story, the ‘light-hearted and funloving’ Elli naively marries  Willi Link because of  the man’s similarity to her father, and Döblin  mentions that Elli’s chosen husband even has the same profession as her  father.60 But problems soon start in the marriage, stemming in part from  what seems to be Elli’s as yet unresolved Oedipal complex. Grete Bende,  too, appears to have strong, unresolved Oedipal ties to one parent, her  mother: ‘Grete had remained unfree due to the close devotedness to her  mother’.61 In keeping with the Oedipal theme, Döblin describes a key  turning-point in the Links’ marriage in pseudo-psychoanalytic terms as a  ‘subterranean disappointment’ (‘unterirdische Enttäuschung’).62 Döblin  thus suggests early in his narrative that a ‘normal’ transference of  Elli’s  desire from her father to the husband becomes impeded. Hence, Elli  experiences a ‘disappointment’ and she regresses to an earlier, apparently  pre-sexual stage of  development.  Elli’s disappointment with her husband, as one of  the multiple factors  behind the breakdown of  the marriage, leads ultimately to the emergence  of  Elli’s homosexuality. To focus on the psychoanalytic addendum at  the end of  Döblin’s case writing is to find this reading reinforced but not  enriched in a substantial way. In the addendum, homosexuality is likewise  depicted as a complex. It first emerges in Grete Bende, in ‘phase 10’, and  in ‘phase 11’ in Elli Link. Grete Bende is ascribed a ‘normal sexuality’ that  is ‘well developed’ and her homosexuality comes to the fore only when she  meets Elli Link. The same occurs with Elli Link, whose desire for Bende  tapped into dormant tendencies that Döblin identifies in the narrative as  ‘an old mechanism that was in the past’.63 The addendum thus suggests  that Elli Link’s homosexuality is not necessarily congenital or innate,  but a response to social or interpersonal circumstances. The emergence  of  homosexual desire is presented in psychological terms in relation to  parental love, as with Freud’s Oedipal complex.  ∙ 170 ∙ </page> <page sequence="16"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime Psychoanalysis and literature’s answer to life science  The psychiatric addendum included in the 1924 edition of  Die beiden  Freund innen und ihr Giftmord offers a type of  expert commentary on the  Klein–Nebbe murder case, in which Döblin reframes the crime and its  circumstances in the language of  psychology and psychoanalysis. As an  additional narrative, the diagrams help to sharpen Döblin’s focus on the  case, in that they foreground the psychic disposition of  the three main  characters in relation to one another over the course of  a couple of  years,  taking up the themes of  the homosexuality of  the two women, all three  main characters’ sadomasochism and Willi Link’s perversion. At the same  time, with its specialist, psychiatric discourse, the addendum does little  to illuminate the literary account, neither strengthening the coherence of   the preceding narrative nor adding greater depth; also, it introduces no  additional factors attenuating the crime that are not already apparent in  the fictionalised version.  As argued, the addendum serves instead to overdetermine the evidence  already in circulation about the Klein–Nebbe murder case. So why did  Döblin include it? One answer is that in highlighting the psychological  determinants of  the case, say, over the social or physiological factors,  the pseudo-medical addendum would seem to lend legitimacy to newly  emerging psychoanalytic epistemologies about sexuality and perversion.  It does so without substantially affecting the literary rendition of  the  case, which is a rendition capable of  much finer analysis. With regard to  the genre of  the case study, Döblin’s creation in the first edition of  Die  beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord is nonetheless significant for what it  conveys about the relationship between the literary laboratory and the  case study in 1920s Germany. More specifically, Die beiden Freundinnen  und ihr Giftmord demonstrates the specific contribution that literary cases  can make.  By the time of  Döblin’s experiments with criminology, sexology and  psychoanalysis in Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord, literature had  evolved as a medium of  communication in unforeseen directions. The  demands of  realism, empiricism and now modernism all altered the way  that writers strived to respond to modern life’s many new challenges. Cer- tainly, in Weimar Germany Döblin found a broad, heterogeneous public  for his hybrid achievement in the novella. And yet, the experimental  nature of  Döblin’s case writing suggests that while the reading public  might have become more capable of  embracing greater complexity in  literary texts – medical, sexo logical, legal, psychoanalytic complexity –  literature struggled to cope with this complexity.  The remarkable epilogue to Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord  provides a number of  clues as to why Döblin overburdened his literary  case study.64 The work began as realistic, documentary-like reportage,  but ended as a wild cacophony of  discourses and diagrams that do not  mesh or meld: ∙ 171 ∙ </page> <page sequence="17"> A history of the cAse study When I cast my eye over the entire thing, it seems like it was in the story:  ‘and then the wind came and tore down the tree.’ I don’t know what type  of  wind it was and where it came from. The whole is a carpet which consists  of  many individual bits, of  cloth, silk, metal pieces as well as lumps of  clay.  It is stitched together with straw, wire, yarn. In some places the parts are  only loosely connected. Other fragments are connected by glue or glass. And  yet it is all seamless and bears the mark of  truth. And this is the way it  happened: even the actors think so. But it could easily not have happened  this way.65 In the metaphor of  a carpet, woven out of  cloth and silk but also metal  and clay, Döblin has found a powerful image for his multidisciplinary  creation. Unsurprisingly, he is not entirely convinced that the heterogen- eity of  methods used has created an integrated whole. That some sections  of  the carpet are woven out of  glass, rope, straw and clay – that is, out  of  material that is normally extraneous to rug weaving – is an admission  that he is not happy with the coherence of  his work. On inspecting its odd  structure, the image of  a patchwork proves no exaggeration. Indeed, more  than a carpet, the case could be seen to resemble a garment or a coat, even  an overcoat; the body woven out of  literary fabric, while the rest is made  of  other disciplinary material. This overcoat could be thought to have,  for instance, graphological sleeves from the two analyses of  the accused’s  handwriting included after the epilogue. The same woven overcoat has  an added frame or fringe in the epilogue and, at the back, a secret gusset,  tucked away out of  sight, in the ten unbound leaves containing the  psychoanalytic emplotment of  the case. The metaphor of  a patchwork carpet or coat aptly captures Döblin’s  keen sense of  the multiple causal factors at play in this intriguing case. Yet  he is baffled and bewitched by its complexity. As the patchwork shows,  this complexity is unwieldy and irreducible; the coherence of  the case is  not so much enhanced by the multiple perspectives as undermined by  them. Döblin, it seems, balks at the disciplinary richness and determin- ism of  the case – a response all the more perplexing given that he was  an expert in most of  the specialist discourses included in Die beiden  Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord. The contemporary crisis of  literature, and the writer’s own existential  crisis, echo throughout Döblin’s epilogue. As a commentary on litera- ture, this aspect of  Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord underscores  Döblin’s pessimistic perceptions of  the limitations of  literary case writing.  While purporting to offer a commentary on the verdict of  the court case,  the epilogue ends up negating the value of  definitive diagnoses; that is, it  undermines the epistemological basis of  case writing. Paradoxically, the  epilogue serves both to distinguish the difference that literature makes  and to negate the ability of  the literary case study to make definitive  judgements about cases altogether.  The topography of  the souls of  the three main characters and the  seventeen phases of  the addendum can be called a curiosity. Undoubtedly  ∙ 172 ∙ </page> <page sequence="18"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime it allowed Döblin to display his expert knowledge and his cultural  capital – such as his familiarity with Freud’s topographical model of  the  soul, Adler’s physio logical models and Jung’s theories of  complexes, as  well as his vast knowledge of  current psychological and psychoanalytic  ideas. As such, the addendum stresses the helplessness of  the modernist  writer, who cannot turn back the clock to realist and naturalist times, but  who cannot solve the challenge of  modernity’s epistemological complex- ity and diversity. This complexity of  modern life – specifically modern  sexual life and the depths of  the modern psyche – presented the greatest  challenge of  all to writers of  literature, and in particular to those clinging  to New Objectivity. Döblin’s compulsion to blur the boundaries between  the literary and the psychoanalytic case study in the one publication, and  to overburden his literary treatment with additions, points to a severe  crisis in aesthetics, one mirrored in the real existential crisis of  the 1920s  writer, who cannot live solely from literature.  Of  course, Döblin was not alone in grappling with the exigencies of   modern life through literary forms that no longer seemed fit for purpose.  His work therefore reflects much of  the multidisciplinarity of  the case  genre of  the period, and the openness of  the literary case study to external  influences at this historical juncture. Döblin must have been aware that his  new type of  forensic case study was not designed for the petit-bourgeois  readers of  ‘penny dreadfuls’. He hints at this in the essay about the rift  in his life between his literary interests and his professional activities. As  a doctor he does not share his namesake’s heightened imagination, and  does not like to read the sort of  literature written by Döblin the writer.  He prefers to read factual literature – travelogues, for example. He also  prefers books written in a less heavy style: ‘it is too heavy for me, you  cannot expect worn-out people to work their way through something like  that voluntarily’.66 Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord could be read as a realist  case study written in a modernist age. It is a work symptomatic of  the  inter-war years in Europe, and particularly in Germany, which struggled  to overcome the traumas of  war neuroses and shell-shock, and found itself   faced with a new war on the home front, in domestic violence. Here Döblin  attempts to link cause and effect in new ways, to show the impact of  war  on peacetime – yet, ultimately, the experiment fails, because he locates  not one cause or one effect, but multiple factors that all contributed  to the violence of  the murder. The sheer complexity of  modern life in  Weimar Germany, of  men and women living in the shadow of  war and  violence, prompted Döblin to take the timeworn form of  the case study  and give it a twist so violent as to make it virtually unrecognisable. To  be sure, he still places a criminal at the centre of  his case history, but  the female criminal is not presented as a specific instance of  a general  rule for disciplinary action or prevention. There is no clear moral to her  acts or to Döblin’s story, no point of  law that he makes. Similarly, his  findings in the addendum are less than equivocal. Homosexuality is not  ∙ 173 ∙ </page> <page sequence="19"> A history of the cAse study so much congenital as a response to parental love, and can sometimes be  circumstantial. Finally, Döblin’s insistence on enriching his account of  the  murder case with psychoanalysis is less than satisfying. While he claims  to have jettisoned psychology entirely, this is not true. Psychoanalysis  certainly informs his writing, but the full impact of  ideas about the  Oedipal complex, sadomasochism and perversions is really felt only in the  diagrammatic addendum.  Instead, in the laboratory of  literary culture, the exception or devia- tion from a norm or rule is normalised as a possible modality of  the  all-too-human. This laboratory functions best, however, when it remains  an inexact science. As Bernhard J. Dotzler remarks, all literature trans- ports knowledge but not all knowledge is science.67 Döblin possibly forgot  that literature is not science. Hence the topographical diagrams of  the  addendum, which were never republished in subsequent editions of  Die  beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord, seem out of  place in a literary  work. For writers and artists with a commitment to New Objectivity, the  solution to the crisis of  literature was to reground literary communication  about sexuality and female criminals in the empirical life sciences, only  to realise, perhaps too late, that literature had a much more sympathetic  complement in psychoanalysis. And yet, as contended above, the mere  addition of  psychoanalytic models after the close of  the narrative does  not necessarily improve readers’ understanding of  sex crimes. The literary  work does not gain from the authentication strategy of  the addendum,  although to Döblin the literary account must have seemed deficient  enough to require further, expert padding. As a result, in this instance, the  case study genre became so overdetermined by extra-literary discourses,  so overwhelmed by disorder and sheer complexity, that it threatened to  separate into its constituent parts altogether. This is indeed what Döblin’s  patchwork creation did over time, insofar as the hidden gusset of  the coat  disappeared from public view into the archive. Meanwhile, his literary  case survived to the present day, in the public domain, to be republished  as part of  all subsequent editions of  the work. Döblin’s first foray into literary case writing presents an extraordinary  case of  murder in order to show that extreme behaviours are possible  and hence potentially part of  the spectrum of  the normal. While some  kinds of  naturalism in literature could be accused of  ‘inscrib[ing] new  normative constraints’, overall Döblin’s first such treatment of  the case  study appears to have the opposite effect: by taking deviance as paradig- matic of  the normal it disrupts the association of  normal sexuality with  heterosexuality, and brings the extraordinary or abnormal into the range  of  possible human behaviours.68 This can be seen from the narrative techniques that Döblin uses in Die  beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord. He combines the neutral focalisa- tion of  an objective or heterodiegetic narrator with rapid changes in  perspective, switching frequently into free, indirect discourses to present  his characters’ inner states of  mind. The effect is to provide insight into  ∙ 174 ∙ </page> <page sequence="20"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime the motivations and psychic dispositions of  all his protagonists, and to  foster empathy, or at least insight. In addition, such close proximity to  the thoughts and emotions of  the criminal inevitably humanises her,  and furthers a particular type of  knowledge about crime. This is a type  of  knowledge that perhaps only literary genres can foster, though their  unique capacity to present what Rita Felski has called a ‘social phenom- enology’.69 The distinctiveness of  the literary mode is manifest in Döblin’s  faithfulness to his sources; he quotes directly from the women’s letters,  while remaining careful to contextualise much of  the evidence given at  the trial, either through reference to Ella Klein’s/Elli Link’s terrible inner  conflict and pangs of  conscience, or through graphic descriptions of  her  husband’s abuse. Döblin seems to have omitted most of  the extremely  revengeful and hateful parts of  the letters, included in the newspapers  and court transcripts. Very little of  the women’s direct coarse language  is included in Döblin’s story, except for one reference to the husband as  a ‘bastard’.70 Döblin’s reference to the women’s increasing desperation  when the rat poison does not take effect is embedded in the broader  context of  Ella Klein’s/Elli Link’s husband’s continued brutality. This  helps to ensure that the reader regards her as the victim of  an increasingly  perverse, depraved and violent husband, a woman who is driven to murder  as a last resort: ‘she was affected by her fate like her husband. Her life  was in danger’.71  Döblin’s humanisation of  the accused women is assisted by his use  of  specialist discourse. By choosing not to characterise the women’s  homosexuality as a perversion, he points to an important function served  by the literary case in his time – that of  understanding and illuminating  from a wide range of  perspectives the complexity of  female criminality,  as distinct from classifying, diagnosing, pathologising or demonising the  criminal. Apart from the expert diagrams of  the addendum, Döblin uses  empathy as his principal means. Empathy, argues Joe Bray, is ‘central to  developing an understanding of  literariness and the value of  literature’.72  Accordingly, Döblin undermines the stereotype of  the Giftmörderin by  complicating the narrative with other circumstances, social, emotional,  psychoanalytic, developmental and sexual causes, all of  which might  have contributed to the act of  murder. The hybrid genre of  the de- specialised and fictionalised case study permits him to achieve all this in  one work. The vast scope of  this genre can encompass discourses from  the empirical human sciences and psychoanalysis; having first distanced  them from their conventional professional purpose, Döblin reintegrates  them, in a dialectical move typical of  the times.73 The specialist discourses  are reframed in terms of  literary communication, resynthesised and  recoded according to binary categories characteristic of  literary work: the   categories of  the possible and the probable. As the simple form that pits  norm against norm – presenting human life as something to be valued and  measured against a norm – the case study becomes the ideal method for  questioning the certainties of  specialist discourse and its truth claims.74  ∙ 175 ∙ </page> <page sequence="21"> A history of the cAse study The case can thus pose a question without providing an answer, leaving  it to the reader to weigh up evidence against other evidence. Döblin’s  case writing in Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord emphasises the  complexity of  murder as the confluence of  multiple factors, and hence  refuses a monocausal explanation or a clear-cut attribution of  guilt; his  case delegates this task to the reader. In the laboratory of  literature, the  deviation is depathologised and reintegrated into the broad spectrum  of  normality, recoded as a possible modality of  the human. The literary  case thus manages to resist classifying the murderer as medical and legal  discourses do. It defies the dominant forensic dispositif, and ultimately  undermines epistemological certainty rather than contributing to it, thus  disrupting the knowledge production of  the specialist discourses it so  deftly borrows from.  Berlin Alexanderplatz: the case study of  collective psychopathology The ‘havoc that World War I continues to wreak’ on the urban popula- tion and relations between the sexes are themes even more pronounced  in Döblin’s last novel from the 1920s, Berlin Alexanderplatz: Die  Geschichte vom Franz Biberkopf (Alexanderplatz Berlin: The Story of  Franz  Biberkopf ).75 He first began writing the work late in 1927, possibly  inspired by Walter Ruttmann’s famous documentary film of  the same  year, Berlin – die Symphonie einer Großstadt (Berlin: Symphony of  a Great  City). Berlin Alexanderplatz was first presented to the public in serialised  form in the newspaper Frankfurter Zeitung in twenty-nine instalments,  before being released as a book in October 1929 with a print run of  10,000  copies.76 It was heralded as the outstanding literary achievement of  the  year and new editions soon followed. By 1936 it had been translated into  nine languages, including English (published in 1931 in New York and  London).77  Franz Biberkopf, the novel’s working-class hero, has served time in  Tegel prison for murdering his girlfriend, Ida, and is released into the  pulsing metropolis of  Berlin at the end of  the Weimar Republic and on  the eve of  the National Socialists’ ascent to power. Although determined  to lead a ‘decent’ life, Biberkopf  soon falls into disreputable company and  loses an arm when his new friend Reinhold thrusts him out of  a getaway  car. The last section of  the novel sees him return to his old ways of  living  the life of  a pimp and a petty criminal with the result that he is almost  charged with murder once again when his girlfriend, the devoted Mieze,  is murdered by Reinhold. Biberkopf  is cleared of  any suspicion but is  physically and psychologically broken by the experience, falling into  a catatonic stupor in Berlin-Buch. He recovers after a close encounter  with death and is effectively resurrected as a new man, finally finding a  respectable job as a porter in a factory. ∙ 176 ∙ </page> <page sequence="22"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime Biberkopf ’s story is told in part as a modern cautionary tale: above all,  a tale of  extreme, uncontrolled violence, of  men pitted against men and,  more worryingly, of  men against women. As Veronika Fuechtner states: ‘in  Berlin Alexanderplatz, modern life is a war’.78 While women in this novel are  the victims of  male violence, the sexes are, as in Die beiden Freundinnen  und ihr Giftmord, very much at war. Maria Tatar observed that ‘Biberkopf   hardly ever makes a move that is not in some way coloured by his relation- ship with the opposite sex ... the women he encounters are habitually  presented as the victims of  rape or murder and are disempowered or effaced  from the written page with a frequency that is nothing short of  alarming’.79 Berlin Alexanderplatz is regarded as Döblin’s greatest contribution to  a left-leaning modernism: he abandons many constraints of  realism and  achieves the much-sought-after synthesis of  discourses and knowledge  that was lacking in Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord. The nar- rative is not strictly linear – instead, Döblin develops a polymodal and  polyvocal form of  narrative that is similar to but different from the  interior monologue characteristic of  modernist writers such as Joyce. As  Walter Benjamin once remarked: The stylistic principle governing [Döblin’s] book is that of  montage.  Petty-bourgeois printed matter, scandalmongering, stories of  accidents,  the sensational incidents of  1928, folk songs, and advertisements rain  down in this text.... Formally, above all the material of  the montage is  anything but arbitrary. Authentic montage is based on the document. In  its fanatical struggle with the work of  art, Dadaism used montage to turn  daily life into its ally.80  The first reviews of  the novel immediately compared it to Joyce’s  masterpiece Ulysses, which appeared in English in 1922 and in German  translation in 1927. Döblin was quick, however, to deny any direct influence  of  Joyce, although the comparison no doubt contributed to the inter- national success of  the work. Rather than adapting Joyce’s technique of   stream of  consciousness, Döblin’s new approach, which he outlined in an  essay written around the same time, ‘Der Bau des epischen Werks’ (‘The  Construction of  the Epic Work’), was to explore the use of  the epic mode in  combination with even more extensive experimentation with techniques  of  montage. According to Döblin, the epic is founded on the form of  the  report, which the author can use for more than merely reporting facts:  ‘he uses it for his notorious non-facts’, and for manipulating reality.81 The  epic draws much of  its veracity from the exemplary nature of  its charac- ters and action, from its ‘powerful fundamental situations, primordial  situations of  human existence’.82 Like his contemporary Brecht, Döblin  envisaged the epic as a new open form of  narrative with no predetermined  plot-line, giving the narrator maximum freedom either to intervene or to  retreat from his subject matter.83 The openness of  the form allowed him  to break down the boundaries between myth and fact, between literary  and scientific discourse, the collective and the individual.84  ∙ 177 ∙ </page> <page sequence="23"> A history of the cAse study In the spirit of  this new interest in modernising the epic tradition,  Döblin superimposes on the story of  Franz Biberkopf  a dense layer of   mythological, biblical, scientific and popular references, from statistics,  descriptions of  medical conditions and his own eyewitness reports from  a local abattoir, to quotations from the Bible and the story of  Job, street  ballads, political songs and nursery rhymes. Through further refining  the technique of  the montage, which he appears to have taken from the  new medium of  the cinema, Döblin synthesises heterogeneous narrative  matter from a wide range of  information about the city itself, including  short biographical vignettes about its other inhabitants. This time he  does not stage his narrative repeatedly through the use of  disparate  discourses and sources, as seen in Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord.  Instead, he incorporates all his external source material and intertextual  allusions directly into his text, often literally with scissors and glue, with  inserts marked by letters or symbols or with Dadaistic collages.85  By the time Döblin wrote this masterpiece, his literary ‘tapestry’ was  so rich in texture that critics have repeatedly been tempted to say the  novel has not one protagonist but many; not the individual criminal but  Berlin, the teeming, devouring metropolis, the Whore of  Babylon herself.  Indeed, the power of  external stimuli from the vitalistic life-world of  the  city is so great that arguably it can no longer be contained by the genre  of  the individual case study. If  Biberkopf ’s subjective experiences are to  be understood as the collective experiences of  a new, subjugated urban  citizen – and if  novelistic character is more an ‘anthropomorphic device’  than a believable construct with psychological interiority – then Döblin’s  reinvention of  the case study in Berlin Alexanderplatz expands the case  genre in radical ways, taking it into new territory for the modern novel.86  Döblin’s novel has been read as both a ‘city-epic’ and a ‘gruesome  criminal ballad’, which testifies to Döblin’s ongoing fascination with the  criminal underworld of  Berlin.87 But it is an unconventional crime story,  since it picks up the criminal’s narrative after his release back into the  community and, hence, it is no longer concerned with the threat of  crime  but with urban criminal life-worlds. The plot is only partially focused  on criminal acts, and instead focuses on Biberkopf ’s rehabilitation and  the multiple threats to his successful reintegration into society. Hence  Döblin’s narrative explodes the boundaries of  the criminal case study, not  only by virtue of  the fact that he seems to regard his main character less  and less as a recidivist criminal or a repeat offender and more and more as  an everyman – as an individual with allegorical resonances.  Such a perspective on Biberkopf  is underscored by Döblin’s use  throughout the novel of  an ironic street-ballad narrator, the narrator of   the murder ballad (or Moritat), who comments on, interprets and moral- ises about  Biberkopf ’s fate. This explicit use of  an authorial narrator  contrasts with the virtual disappearance of  the narrator in many of  the  montage or collage sections, which are stitched together without the aid  of  commentary. Indeed, the narrative voice is itself  ‘montage-like’: it is  ∙ 178 ∙ </page> <page sequence="24"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime ‘not a constant preterite presence with a firmly established vantage point,  but a compound voice, a series of  contrasting attitudes, a prismatic- ally broken point of  view in keeping with Döblin’s injunction ... to be  “decisively lyrical, dramatic, even reflective”’.88 With multiple masks and  personas, including a new-found didacticism that helps him illuminate  the case, Döblin’s narrator is no longer the objective but the empathetic  narrator of  the case study, as in Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord,  who had struggled to diagnose or pinpoint the exact causes of  the murder.  Indeed, the voice of  Döblin’s narrator summarising the moral of  the tale  is not taken from the empirical, scientific world of  the modern medical  case study. Rather, it originates in the disparate sources of  the chorus of   Greek tragedy and the streets of  Berlin:  We have come to the end of  our story. It has proved a long one, but it  had to unfold itself, on and on, till it reached its climax, that culminating  point which at last illuminates the whole thing.... It was a strange process  of  revelation. Franz Biberkopf  did not walk the street like us. He rushed  blindly down this dark street....89 Döblin’s many departures from the conventions of  crime writing  in recounting the story of  Biberkopf ’s rise and fall manage to avoid  the appeal to theories of  racial ‘degenerescence’ and decline typical of   natural ism. As Irene Gammel has observed: ‘despite the growing rejec- tion of  the heredity-degenerescence model in the twentieth century, the  plot of  decline remains prominent in twentieth-century social realism’.90  Despite Biberkopf ’s best intentions at leading a life of  respectability upon  his release from jail, he cannot escape from the vicious circle of  violence  and crime in modern society. This is not because of  any innate disposition  or hereditary determinism (as associated with alcoholism, for example, in  works by Zola and Hauptmann). Ultimately, Biberkopf  falls prey to the  violence that is endemic to the working-class and criminal milieu in which  he moves in Berlin, unable to rise above those underworld circles of  pimps  and petty criminals or to gain a foothold outside their circles. As such,  Biberkopf ’s fate testifies to the pervasive ‘paranoia of  proletarianization’  that Döblin no doubt himself  felt and that affected all middle-class  Germans in the midst of  the 1929 global stock market crisis.91  Döblin’s focus on criminality and violence surfaces again towards the  conclusion of  Berlin Alexanderplatz, where Biberkopf ’s sadistic friend  Reinhold Hoffmann lures Mieze, Biberkopf ’s girlfriend, into a forest and  murders her in cold blood. In this powerful scene, Döblin mobilises all the  generative possibilities of  montage into a highly dramatic finale, simul- taneously staging a radically new modernist aesthetic that represents  an important innovation in the literary treatment of  violent crime. He  combines rapid changes of  perspective between Hoffmann and Mieze,  male to female, villain and victim; he shifts from direct to indirect speech,  from authorial commentary to biblical fragments from Ecclesiastes, from  a language of  emotion to the cold language of  the abattoir report. The  ∙ 179 ∙ </page> <page sequence="25"> A history of the cAse study external influences on Biberkopf, Hoffmann and Mieze are so pervasive –  from social and moral pressures to conform, the conflicting drives of  envy  and jealousy, and the Darwinistic struggles between male rivals – that  agency, especially criminal agency, threatens to evaporate altogether. Although more narrative space is devoted to the female victim’s ex- perience of  violence, Döblin also allows his male villain to speak. In  both Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord and Berlin Alexander- platz, Döblin deploys various literary devices that allow him to express  empathy, in particular, but not only, for his female characters: for the  female poisoner in the former and the female victim in the latter. Little  narrative space is devoted to the male victim of  murder in Die beiden  Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord, who, it can be safely assumed, deserves his  fate. Here Döblin’s aesthetics of  empathy seek to understand the criminal  act from the perspective of  the female perpetrator, and are only partially  offset by a poetics of  shock, designed to evince some horror at least at  the circumstances of  the murder. Arguably Döblin’s densely woven epic  montage in Berlin Alexanderplatz is far more shocking on many scores. It  tells of  the murder of  Mieze almost at once from all sides, from outside  looking in and inside looking out. The plaintive voice of  the victim makes  it less detached, unleashing more emotional and pathos-laden registers;  the insistent repetition of  biblical quotes (‘there is a time for everything’)  underscores the terrible inexorability of  the young woman’s murder.  In the murder scene and elsewhere in the novel, structural violence,  or the ‘war of  daily life’, finds its expression in a type of  linguistic and  narrative violence inflicted upon the literary text.92 Syntax is disrupted,  narrative linearity is fragmented, there is no single subjective perspective,  as the point of  view shifts back and forth from victim to villain, from  outside to inside, from human to animal. Violence and the language of   war are all-pervasive, and yet in Berlin Alexanderplatz the question of   individual guilt and agency is less acute than the problem of  the psycho- pathology of  an urban population under siege from multiple quarters. Overall, Döblin’s deep familiarity with medical and psychiatric case  writing traditions is less pronounced in Berlin Alexanderplatz. His medical  training comes to the fore early in the novel in two main passages. The  first is in the first chapter (or ‘book’), when he inserts a passage from a  medical textbook about the causes of  sexual impotence: ‘Sexual potency  depends upon the combined action of  (1) the internal secretory system,  (2) the nervous system, and (3) the sexual apparatus’.93 The second occurs  immediately after, when the narrator inserts a description of  a contem- porary treatment: ‘Testifortan, authorised patent No. 365695, sexual  therapeutic agent approved by Sanitary Councillor Dr Magnus Hirschfeld  and Dr Bernhard Schapiro, Institute of  Sexual Science, Berlin’.94 Homo- sexuality is also not a major concern of  the novel, although it does  figure in the homoerotic relationship between Mieze and Eva and in the  homosexually charged relationship that develops between Reinhold and  Franz. The most significant influence from Döblin’s medical practice and  ∙ 180 ∙ </page> <page sequence="26"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime his long-standing engagement with psychoanalysis, however, can be found  in the scene at the end of  the novel when Biberkopf, who has become  delusional after the murder of  Mieze, is admitted to Berlin-Buch. In a  scene in which the doctors deliberate over his diagnosis, Döblin manages  to parody both Freudian interpretations of  psychopathology and his  own mentor Hoche’s more physiological approach to mental illness in the   physicians treating Biberkopf.95  More broadly, this accomplished work and his earlier criminal case  study in Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr Giftmord are aesthetic responses  to the enduring impact of  the First World War on normative categories  of  gender and the proletarian classes, and both can be read as attempts  to grapple with the legacies of  a diseased and traumatised body politic  after the First World War.96 In his first attempt at literary case writing,  Döblin sought to integrate the workings, even the discourse, of  the  unconscious into his representation of  violence – with little success.  Through experimenting with literary techniques to elicit empathy in his  readers, he tried to show how women could be driven to violence. With its  disparate components, the first edition of  Die beiden Freundinnen und ihr  Giftmord was an especially fragmented literary case study that reflected  in many ways the writer’s failure to integrate deep psychology with  documentary realism. In the 1920s, Döblin was increasingly involved in  the activities of  the Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute, which emphasised  healing the collective unconscious; consequently, his eyes were opened to  the implications of  cases of  violent crime for the collective psyche of  the  masses. The Institute was the point of  departure for many pioneers of   political psychology who strove to incorporate Marxist philosophy and  social theory into psychoanalysis.97 Although he never turned his back  on Freudian psychoanalysis, like fellow members of  the Berlin Psycho- analytic Institute, by the end of  the 1920s Döblin increasingly questioned  why Freud was not more concerned with the societal dimensions of  his  fragile, isolated ego.98 Berlin Alexanderplatz thus reflects many of  the new  concerns of  socially aware Berlin psychoanalysts in Döblin’s exploration  of  the wider socio-political dimensions of  violence, its toll on relations  between the sexes, and the social cost of  war on public health.  Ultimately, however, Döblin was unable to explain the ‘how’ and ‘why’  of  the specific cases of  violent crime that are the focus of  his literary treat- ments. He increasingly preferred narrative chaos or disorder over order,  and multiple causal principles over single causes, and he privileged an  almost impossibly complex amalgam of  historical, social and physiological  determinants of  violence. Nevertheless, in the later work he found a  language capable of  convincingly representing the anonymous, impersonal  violence that haunted German society in the years of  the Weimar Republic,  writing a fitting monument to the city of  Berlin. Berlin Alexanderplatz is  thus testament to his vast reservoir of  experience ‘as a doctor and a writer’  acquired from treating patients from criminal and petty bourgeois milieu  for an array of  different medical, sexological and psychological conditions. ∙ 181 ∙ </page> <page sequence="27"> A history of the cAse study *** Berlin Alexanderplatz cemented Döblin’s reputation in Germany as a  major novelist and in 1931, shortly after its publication, he was elected  into the senate of  the literary section of  the Prussian Academy.99 Despite  the critical acclaim he achieved through the novel, this was not sufficient  for him to be able to give up practising medicine altogether, even though  he did close his social welfare practice on the Frankfurter Allee and opened  up a private practice in Charlottenburg in 1931. Döblin describes this  move away from the poorer districts of  Berlin as a ‘catastrophic decision’  (‘katastrophalen Entschluß’).100 It proved to be a crucial turning-point in  his life: giving up his licence to work as a social welfare doctor effectively  meant he would never practise medicine again.101 This downturn in his  career was, however, soon to pale into insignificance when the National  Socialists came to power in 1933 and Döblin found himself  blacklisted.  In 1933 Döblin fled to France with six members of  his immediate family.  After the events of  Kristallnacht he wrote: ‘everything in Germany had  become unbearable, not only politically but intellectually as well’.102  Initially, he had high hopes that exile would somehow reinvigorate his  stagnating career. In France he became close friends with the critic and  German scholar Robert Minder, who promoted his work, and Döblin  and his family took out French citizenship. In 1940, after his two sons  Wolfgang and Klaus were deployed with the French army, Döblin, his wife  and youngest son escaped Europe for the USA, joining the community of   German exiles in Los Angeles. Without a regular income from his medical  practice, and unable to live from his writing, however, Döblin and his  family found themselves in dire financial straits. After his contract as a  story writer with MGM film studios expired Döblin was almost entirely at  the mercy of  the generosity of  other émigrés, such as Lion Feuchtwanger.  Unlike Thomas Mann, who lived a life of  relative affluence in exile, Döblin  struggled with his loss of  relevancy and social status, his precarious  financial situation and his grim lack of  career prospects. He continued  writing on a number of  projects, among which was a four-volume epic  about revolution, November 1918, which he finished in 1941. It was  during this time that he converted to Catholicism in a futile attempt to  establish himself  in America. It was to make little difference, as he was  later to write, and he had to ‘live like a beggar for years’. He ‘was not  only condemned to complete silence, disempowered, but even worse than  that: degraded, worth less than a native illiterate person who can at least  converse with his neighbours’.103 Those émigrés who were reliant on their  language for their livelihood suffered especially, he writes, becoming little  more than ‘a living corpse’.104 Oddly, Döblin does not appear to have  sought refuge in the émigré psychoanalytic community, for instance in  the company of  his mentor and fellow Jew and socialist Simmel. Simmel  was also living in Hollywood during the war, where he helped to establish  psychoanalytic institutes in Los Angeles and San Francisco.105 ∙ 182 ∙ </page> <page sequence="28"> Alfred döblin’s literAry cAses About women And crime After the war, Döblin returned to Germany with his wife but found the  post-war climate singularly unconducive to rebuilding his literary career.  He had by now several finished manuscripts but he found it difficult to  find a publisher for them. He finished his last novel, Hamlet oder die lange  Nacht nimmt ein Ende (Hamlet, or Tales of  a Long Night) in 1947 but he  had little success in convincing one of  the major publishers, Piper in  Munich and Kiepenheuer in Cologne, to publish it. It was only towards  the end of  his life that, through the stewardship of  poet Peter Huchel, he  secured an East German publisher for his last work.  These difficulties were compounded by personal problems. At the war’s  end, Döblin and his wife learned of  their son Wolfgang’s suicide in 1940,  when, as a member of  the French armed services, he found himself   confronted by German troops. Moreover, Döblin’s health problems which  had begun during the war continued; in 1949 he was diagnosed with   Parkinson’s disease, and in 1952 he suffered a further heart attack. Finally,  feeling spurned and misunderstood, Döblin decided to leave Germany in  1953 and to resettle in France, where he lived until his death in 1957. He  complained in a letter to Huchel in 1954: ‘So the reading public does not  want to buy anything of  mine because I am an emigrant, and in addition  to that, someone who served for France’.106 When compared with other celebrated modernist writers of  the period,  such as Franz Kafka, Mann, Joyce and Brecht, Döblin is today far less  well known outside the German-speaking world. Even his last work failed  to strike a chord with post-war publishers. Hamlet took up all the major  themes of  his earlier novels – the search for self; war; violence; the  relationship between the sexes – in an account of  an English soldier’s  peacetime struggles to come to grips with war trauma. In the conservative  climate of  the post-war period, when international publishers preferred  Kafka, Mann and Rilke to more risky and difficult contemporary authors,  Döblin, the assimilated Jew who had taken out French citizenship and  spent the war in exile, reached an impasse.107 Cold War politics would also  play their part in the lack of  interest in Döblin’s works: he found more  political allies in the German Democratic Republic, but aesthetically  he had more in common with West German writers such as Gottfried  Benn. Had his health been better, and had he been willing to embrace  the socialist experiment in East Germany, Döblin might have obtained a  better chance of  thriving, by emigrating there.  Döblin’s empathetic literary case studies, which combined medical,  sexological and social knowledge about human frailty, which he saw  epitomised in the acts of  criminals, were a masterful synthesis of  real-life  sources and new forms of  expert knowledge. Yet, at least for the time  being, the psycho analytic case study about the low-life criminal failed  to appeal as a form that the post-war era was ready to embrace. In West  Germany the public was keen to discover new voices and to disavow most  continuities with the past. Attention became focused on Gruppe 47, the  literary association founded in 1947 that provided a prominent forum for  ∙ 183 ∙ </page> <page sequence="29"> A history of the cAse study emerging writers to present their experiments with politics and aesthetics.  Then again, as one chapter of  case writing in literature was closing, a new  chapter in the history of  the case study was opening: European psycho- analysts fleeing the ravages of  German National Socialism and World  War Two had exported the genre across the Atlantic Ocean, bringing it to  unforeseen discursive contexts and tasks.
