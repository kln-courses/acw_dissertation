<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paradise Lost V, VI: The War in Heaven by William McQueen I N Paradise Lost, beginnings, middles, and ends are variously wrested from their chronological contexts, informing the old plot, in the process, with surprising and invigorating new perspectives. The poem begins, as everyone knows, in medias res, and I suppose it is equally obvious that it ends with a beginniing, and that the beginning occurs near the middle. In the course of this paper, I would like to consider one aspect of this beginning in the middle, the War in Heaven, which has been perennially one of the least appreciated parts of Paradise Lost. At about line 6oo of Book V, God announces to the angels assembled before his throne the exaltation of the Son, and the plot action begins. The proper response, celebrative joy ex- pressed in harmonious sound and mystical dance through the hierarchies of heaven, spontaneously begins. But then comes the complication: "All seem'd well pleas'd, all seem'd, but were not all." Satan, ... fraught With envy against the Son of God, that day Honor'd by his great Father, and proclaim'd Messiah King annointed, could not bear Through pride that sight, and thought himself impair'd. Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain, Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour Friendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv'd 89</page><page sequence="2">go Paradise Lost V, VI: The War in Heaven With all his Legions to dislodge and leave Unworshipt, unobey'd the Throne supreme. (V, 661-70)' This, rather than Satan reviving on the burning lake, is the true beginning. But because of that previous scene there is something like a second beginning here, a repetition of an action already partly experienced through the distorted but vivid accounts of Satan and others immediately after the fall. This "renewed" beginning, however, gains intensity and perspective from the scenes intervening between it and the opening scene in Hell. This time there is a much stronger sense of what Satan is revolt- ing against. The harmonious scenes in Paradise have qualified the way in which revolt is seen, and Satan is now exposed to a more searching scrutiny in the light of Heaven, where his rhetoric is refuted by Abdiel and his boasts are tested by direct conflict with opposing force rather than magnified and distorted by the uncritical allegiance of his followers. The dialogue between Raphael and Adam, which had begun with an emphasis upon the setting and the two participants, shifts now to a super-human conflict between cosmic adver- saries, yet it remains linked to humanity through its accommo- dated imagery. The battle rages on a transcendent level, but the metaphor which embodies it works through its images in both directions. Human warfare is used to image and interpret the conflict in Heaven, and at the same time the cosmic dimension of the battle amplifies Milton's views on human warfare and heroism. The first day's battle is Milton's main exercise in the depiction of warfare in the epic manner. The scene is filled with the accoutrements of war-shields, spears, armor, even chariots and "firey, foaming steeds." Great masses of armed legions occupy the background, with the foreground filled by a series of indi- vidual skirmishes presented in rapidly shifting close-ups. Satan, while not the dominant figure-he is, in fact, consistently I All quotations from Paradise Lost are taken from Merritt Hughes, ed., Jobn Milton: Complete Poems and Major Prose (New York, 19S7).</page><page sequence="3">William McQueen 9I discomfited-is the most prominent figure in the landscape before the battle, and once the battle begins the encounters in which he participates are depicted in greater detail than any of the others. As the battle begins, the rebellious army approaches with Satan a splendid figure at the center, Far in th' Horizon to the North appear'd From skirt to skirt a fiery Region, stretcht In battailous aspect, and nearer view Bristl'd with upright beams innumerable Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng'd, and Shields ... High in the midst exalted as a God Th' Apostate in his Sun-bright Chariot sat Idol of Majesty Divine, enclos'd With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now 'Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, A dreadful interval, and Front to Front Presented stood in terrible array Of hideous length: before the cloudy Van, On the rough edge of battle ere it join'd, Satan with vast and haughty strides advanc'd, Came tow'ring, arm'd in Adamant and Gold. (VI, 79-I IO) He is met in the "dreadful interval" by Abdiel, who comments on the Satanic image, O Heav'n! That such resemblance of the Highest Should yet remain, where faith and realty Remain not. (VI, II4-6) Such is Abdiel's role throughout. His obedience to God throws into relief the qualities of both Satan's leadership and his fol- lowers' subservience. In the momentary poise before the battle, Satan and Abdiel once more oppose each other rhetorically. In reply to Satan's scornful remark,</page><page sequence="4">92 Paradise Lost V, VI: The War in Heaven I see that most through sloth had rather serve, Minist'ring Spirits, train'd up in Feast and Song; Such hast thou arm'd, the Minstrelsy of Heav'n, Servility with freedom to contend, (VI, i66-9) Abdiel counters, This is servitude, To serve th' unwise, or him who hath rebell'd Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, Thyself not free but to thyself enthrall'd. (VI, I78-8I) Then he strikes the first blow, and the battle begins. As Satan recoils ten paces backward and sinks to one knee, the focus shifts to a generalized view of the battle, which at this point is evoked conspicuously through sounds: Now storming fury rose, And clamor such as heard in Heav'n till now Was never, Arms on Armor clashing bray'd Horrible discord, and the madding Wheels Of brazen Chariots rag'd; dire was the noise Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss Of fiery Darts in flaming volleys flew, And flying vaulted either Host with fire. (VI, 207-I4) The next specific encounter, between Satan and Michael, is representative of the first day's battle. At the culmination of their fight, Michael's sword from the armory of God cuts through Satan's sword and shears all his right side. . . . then Satan first knew pain, And writh'd him to and fro convolv'd; so sore The griding sword with discontinuous wound Pass'd through him, but th' Ethereal substance clos'd Not long divisible, and from the gash A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow'd Sanguine, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed, And all his Armor stain'd erewhile so bright.

Yet soon he heal'd .... (VI, 3z7-44) The pain inflicted on the rebels, the nature of angelic substance, the consistent but indecisive victories of the loyal angels, and the note of excess, verging on the ludicrous, that attends Satan throughout the battle are all present in this passage. After Satan's departure and a generalized account of a number of individual clashes, the first day draws to an inconclusive close. God has imposed conditions that make a decisive victory for either army unlikely. Given the nature of these combatants and the even numbers-a third of the angels on each side (see VI, 49, I56)-the battle as it is constituted on the first day can hardly prove conclusive. The first day's battle, then, presents the conflict in the epic tradition of military heroism. The struggle is between massive armies drawn in military array, with a series of encounters be- tween individual champions according to a mutually assumed code of military behavior. On the second day, Satan attempts his crude transcendence of the military expectations by the intro- duction of artillery, and the action coarsens to burlesque. Many readers have expressed dissatisfaction with the depiction of Satan in Book VI. He lacks the grandeur and eloquence that they have come to expect of him, and they suspect that Milton's magnificent conception of Satan falters momentarily here. But if the war in Heaven is read, as Arnold Stein suggests,2 as a deliberate use of ridicule and the grotesque, one can perceive the changes in Satan's diction and the ludicrous deterioration of the battle as a 2 "Milton's War in Heaven-An Extended Metaphor," in Answerable Stle (Minneapolis, I953); also available in the collections of essays on Milton by Arthur Barker and Louis Martz.</page><page sequence="6">94 Paradise Lost 1, VI: The War in Heaven functional modulation rather than as a lapse of artistic control.3 The introduction of the artillery initiates a new mode of battle and a different tone. As the loyal angels fall by the thousands, "Angel on Arch-Angel Roll'd," Satan's diction lowers from the grandiloquent rhetoric of his earlier speeches to a sneering, mock formality. Satan beheld thir plight, And to his Mates thus in derision call'd. O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? Erewhile they fierce were coming, and when wee, 3 I have realized since completing this article that my stress here upon the comic aspects of Satan's characterization receives further support from John Steadman's similar interpretation of the transformation scene (P.L. X, 504 ff.). Our conclusions concerning two episodes involving ridicule are in some ways remarkably alike and, in my opinion, supplement each other in their common stress upon Milton's modulation from the heroic to the comic in his characterization of Satan. I refer the interested reader to the final two chapters of Steadman's Milton's Epic Characters (Univ. North Carolina Press, i968). The following two paragraphs from pages 3 I4-5 of Steadman's book will, I believe, indicate the similarity of our conclusions, if not of our methods: "The pseudo-heroic archangel of the early books and the 'ridiculous' devil of the transformation-scene represent (in part at least) the poet's response to problems posed by neo-Aristotelian criticism-the problem of achieving gravity, elevation, and variety within the epic genre; the problem of maintaining consistency and verisimilitude in character; the problem of making an evil persona both 'appro- priate' and 'good.' It is scarcely surprising, therefore, that Milton's 'anti-hero' seems a many faceted figure. Tragic, heroic, comic-he is all of these, and con- temporary criticism can ignore his diversity only at its own peril. Moreover, all three of these aspects were, in varying degrees, conventional. Medieval and Renaissance drama had not infrequently degraded the devil to a comic buffoon, the butt of slapstick jokes or the dupe of ingenious conjurors. Yet an 'archangel ruined' is nonetheless a tragic personage, and more than one Renaissance tragedy had introduced him as such, either as antagonist or protagonist. Renaissance epic, in turn, had portrayed him occasionally in heroic terms as a warrior, the valiant and redoubtable adversary of Michael. "For Milton neither the tragic nor the heroic vision was complete. Only the comic mode could expose the vanities of the builders of Babel, the abstruse absurdi- ties of the astronomers, or the futility of Satan's ambitious conspiracies. To emphasize the deformity of sin, the ugliness of vice, the poet resorted (as Renaissance theory directed him) to the Ridiculous. Though the comic elements in his epic are not obtrusive, he exploited them deliberately-even 'methodically'-as a form of moral judgment, a device for introducing the divine estimate of character and action."</page><page sequence="7">William McQueen 95 To entertain them fair with open Front And Breast, (what could we more ?) propounded terms Of composition, straight they chang'd thir minds, Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, As they would dance, yet for a dance they seem'd Somewhat extravagant and wild, perhaps For joy of offer'd peace: but I suppose If our proposals once again were heard We should compel them to a quick result. (VI, 607-I9) The mockery is picked up by Belial's speech "in like gamesome mood": Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, Of hard contents, and full of force urg'd home, Such as we might perceive amus'd them all, And stumbl'd many; who receives them right, Had need from head to foot well understand; Not understood, this gift they have besides, They show us when our foes walk not upright. (VI, 62I-7) The tone becomes crudely comic, signalling a corresponding shift from heroic warfare to burlesque. The account of the tum- bling angels and the derision of the two punsters initiates a coarsening of the action as the warfare degenerates into undisci- plined, ineffectual rage on both sides. After momentary con- fusion, the loyal angels throw away their arms, and From thir foundations loos'ning to and fro They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggy tops Uplifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze Be sure, and terror seiz'd the rebel Host, When coming towards them so dread they saw The bottom of the Mountains upward turn'd .... (VI, 643-9) Then extricating themselves from their crushed armor and struggling from beneath the mountains piled on them, the rebels reply in kind.</page><page sequence="8">96 Paradise Lost V, VI: The War in Heaven The rest in imitation to like Arms Betook them, and the neighboring Hills uptore; So Hills amid the Air encounter'd Hills Hurl'd to and fro with jaculation dire, That under ground they fought in dismal shade: Infernal noise; War seem'd a civil Game To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt Upon confusion rose . . . . (VI, 662-9) And so the struggle between two magnificent armies reaches its ridiculous conclusion. All discipline gone, the battle surges in blind, convulsive fury underground. The action, to appro- priate Satan's words, has become "somewhat extravagant and wild." As the moment of God's intervention approaches, reasons for his delay are clearly explained. ... now all Heav'n Had gone to wrack, with ruin overspread, Had not th' Almighty Father where he sits Shrin'd in his Sanctuary of Heav'n secure, Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen This tumult, and permitted all, advis'd: That his great purpose he might so fulfil, To honor his Anointed Son aveng'd Upon his enemies, and to declare All power on him transferr'd.... (VI, 669-78) God seems to have arranged an exemplum of his own. Satan has consistently thought of his insurrection in terms of armed force, grossly misunderstanding both the nature of the power he opposes and his own. His solution to the reverses of the first day's battle is improved weaponry, an escalation of force. God, however, remains outside the action, allowing the oppos- ing armies to contend freely until the struggle has degenerated into a blind and furious confusion. Then he intervenes. His remarks at the end of the second day's battle are a judgment on Satan's conception of power. "War wearied," he says, "hath perform'd what War can do." He has arranged an</page><page sequence="9">William Me.Queen 97 instructive demonstration for both the loyal and the rebellious angels. The demonstration is not complete, however, until the final resolution of the military impasse on the third day. Satan has challenged the Son's fitness to rule. The Son's performance on the third day justifies his exaltation. But in a particular way-so as to show that the Son's power comes from his accord with the will of the Father. The theme is obedience. But beyond Raphael's emphasis, which is at least partially on obedience as joy, God's lesson, as a response and corrective to Satan, is that obedience is power; or, to take Satan's obsession as the term to be defined, power is obedience. God, the definitive commentator, points out the significance of the action, then withdraws, placing the culminating emphasis upon the Son. War wearied hath perform'd what War can do, And to disorder'd rage let loose the reins, With Mountains as with Weapons arm'd, which makes Wild work in Heav'n, and dangerous to the main. Two days are therefore past, the third is thine; For thee I have ordain'd it, and thus far Have suffer'd, that the Glory may be thine Of ending this great War, since none but Thou Can end it. Into thee such Virtue and Grace Immense I have transfus'd, that all may know In Heav'n and Hell thy Power above compare, And this perverse Commotion govern'd thus, To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir Of all things, to be Heir and to be King By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. (VI, 695-709) In his reply, the Son repeats the word "Glory," equating it with obedience and, in implicit contrast to Satan, emphasizing the concord between his will and that of the Father. . . . this I my Glory account, My exaltation, and my whole delight, That thou in me well pleas'd, declar'st thy will Fulfill'd, which to fulfil is all my bliss. (VI, 726-9)</page><page sequence="10">98 Paradise Lost V, VI: The War in Heaven His ambition is to obey and, his mission having been performed, he will gladly resign the power which he assumes, preferring the harmony which shall follow to the discord which he must now dispel. Sceptre and Power, thy giving, I assume, And gladlier shall resign, when in the end Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov'st.... (VI, 730-3) Now, however, he turns to the task before him. But whom thou hat'st, I hate, and can put on Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, Arm'd with thy might, rid heav'n of these rebell'd, To thir prepar'd ill Mansion driven down, To chains of darkness, and th' undying Worm, That from thy just obedience could revolt, Whom to obey is happiness entire. (VI, 734-41) Then mounting the mystical chariot of Paternal Deity, he moves into battle as the sole and sufficient champion of God. There is no longer any real contest. Satan fades into the ranks, indistinguishable from the debilitated mass of his stricken le- gions. ... they astonisht all resistance lost, All courage; down thir idle weapons dropp'd; O'er Shields and Helms, and helmed heads he rode Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate. . . . (VI, 838-4I) The conclusion might seem anti-climactic if it were not for the energy-charged evocation of the terrible power of the Son's triumph. The lines describing the Son's charge against the rebels present a power that almost exceeds the images which convey it- an excessive power that must be checked even as it is unleashed. Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check'd His Thunder in mid Volley, for he meant Not to destroy, but to root them out of Heav'n: The overthrown he rais'd, and as a Herd</page><page sequence="11">William MeQueen 99 Of Goats or timorous flock together throng'd Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu'd With terrors and with furies to the bounds And Crystal wall of Heav'n, which op'ning wide, Roll'd inward, and a spacious Gap disclos'd Into the wasteful Deep; the monstrous sight Struck them with horror backward, but far worse Urg'd them behind; headlong themselves they threw Down from the verge of Heav'n, Eternal wrath Burn'd after them to the bottomless pit. (VI, 8 5 3-66) Satan's derision is answered by a power that renders his mighty army as ineffectual as a herd of goats or timorous flock. The violence of the expulsion is immediately followed, however, by harmonious hymns of praise from the angels who have stood silent, "Eye-witnesses of his Almighty Acts." The battle is ended, and Messiah returns " Sole Victor from th' expulsion of his Foes." We realize in retrospect that the antithetical scenes in Books II and III in which Satan and the Son volunteered as the cham- pions of Hell and Heaven respectively have, among other things, prepared for Raphael's account of the conflict in Heaven. In those earlier books the two heroes, carefully insulated from each other, were implicitly presented as opposing champions. We know that these scenes occurred after the battle which is pre- sented in Raphael's flashback, but in our reading experience they are prior, and their bold, antithetical outline-basic enough to be retained perhaps even beyond the periphery of conscious thought-has prepared for the military imagery of warring champions. As the battle in Heaven unfolds, however, we gradually per- ceive the limitations of the military metaphor. In his prefatory remarks to Adam, Raphael had first indicated that it was not the real thing but a vehicle for accommodated truth. ... how shall I relate To human sense th' invisible exploits Of warring Spirits; how without remorse</page><page sequence="12">o00 Paradise Lost V, VI: The War in Heaven The ruin of so many glorious once And perfet while they stood; how last unfold The secrets of another World, perhaps Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good This is dispens't, and what surmounts the reach Of human sense, I shall delineate so, By lik'ning spiritual to corporal forms, As may express them best. . . (V, 564-74) Then he adds, ... though what if Earth Be but the shadow of Heav'n, and things therein Each to other like, more than on Earth is thought? (V, 5 74-6) The ambiguity allows a wide range of imaginative possibilities, even while suggesting an essential validity-whether metaphori- cal or actual. Milton uses the military metaphor as long as it is convenient and when it becomes cumbersome he discards-or rather transcends it. It functions effectively through the first day's battle, carrying the burden of the narrative. During the second day's battle it begins to deteriorate, as heroism gives way to something approaching caricature; then on the third day, with the entrance of Messiah into battle, it is transcended. Satan, we realize, has served as a foil. His whole characteri- zation is subordinated to his depiction as a vainglorious military commander. He becomes an archetype of the old heroism,4 pre- sented unsympathetically and shading toward caricature as he is superseded by a new heroism. In the sense that Satan and the Son are conceived in terms of epic heroism they are enlarged types of human behavior-negative and positive moral exem- plars. This statement needs immediate qualification, however. In terms of human action, Satan is more an exemplary figure- albeit a negative one-than is the Son. Abdiel is more nearly the positive figure for human emulation. The military metaphor can scarcely contain the power of the Messiah, but Abdiel 4 For a full explication of this idea, see Steadman's sections on "The Heroic Image" and "The Heroic Idol" in Mil/on's Epic Characters.</page><page sequence="13">William Mc2Queen IOI functions easily within it. Later, in Paradise Regained, Christ is presented as an extreme model for human emulation, but here he acts primarily as an aspect of the Godhead-although Milton's antithetical patterning of the two champions frequently requires that he be related to Satan through the anthropomorphic metaphor of military heroism. Satan and Abdiel are depicted for the most part within the range of human motives and potential, but the Son, in the discovery of the third day, simply transcends the metaphor. There is no commensurate adversary for him. Again, there is a problem of achieving narrative suspense in a twice told tale. One solution is a variation on Milton's technique of temporarily screening off a vital part of the action, of pre- senting a partial, and therefore distorted, perspective and then gradually revealing its inadequacies. In a manner reminiscent of the opening scenes in Hell, yet different because of the exigencies of the new context, Milton at first insulates Satan from the full perspective by delaying God's intervention. This allows Satan to loom larger than he would otherwise. But this time we are not as likely to be deceived, and during the whole episode an aura of disparaging irony hovers about Satan. The very scenes in Hell that previously displayed his "heroic" defiance remind us of the outcome. We still retain a vivid impression of the aftermath of the battle, of Satan awakening in Hell; and we also remember the intervening scenes-the encounters with Sin and Death, for instance, and Satan's juxta- position with Adam and Eve in the Garden-which have modified our impressions of his heroic stature. In addition, this time there is more than the Narrator's disembodied voice to reveal Satan's distortions. The narrating voice is reinforced by a number of reflectors such as Abdiel, Michael, and the loyal angels generally, who display, even in the first two day's battle, a counter-image of Satan. Tension is generated most powerfully by the disparity between the perspectives of the major adversaries-Satan on the one hand, the Godhead on the other. And it, of course, reaches its greatest</page><page sequence="14">102 Paradise Lost V-/- VI: The War in Heaven intensity in the resolution on the third day. Satan is dominant in the early scenes, while the Son is reserved for the climactic third day. By delaying Satan's recognition of the omnipotent power that he opposes, Milton creates psychological suspense. Appropriately for an omnipotent creator responding to the challenge of one of his willful creatures, God never exerts his full power, nor deigns to confront Satan directly. The fact that God's power is mediated through his champions allows Satan, despite pain and discouraging reverses, to continue the fight and in the second day's battle even to gain a momentary triumph. Yet Satan is blind to the vast reservoirs of power still unchallenged by his rebellion. Satan's blindness is, in fact, the main source of tension in this conflict of incommensurate forces. The action is presented so as to dramatize his obtuseness. Abdiel, the chief of the minor reflectors, establishes a critical perspective toward Satan as he responds to Satan's hubris with indignation and amazement, ... fool, not to think how vain Against th' Omnipotent to rise in Arms; Who out of the smallest things could without end Have rais'd incessant Armies to defeat Thy folly; or with solitary hand Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelm'd Thy Legions under darkness.... (VI, I 3 5-4z) Even Satan's subordinates-one at least, and for Milton's pur- poses one is sufficient-can perceive the folly of Satan's action. But this perception alone is not enough. Satan's presumption must be countered by a proportionate response. And the degree of his presumption exceeds the power of all but God's chosen surrogate to respond. In this respect alone, the two champions are commensurate: Satan's presumption matches the Messiah's punishment. Satan's delayed discovery is the major source of narrative suspense. And his peculiar blindness, his failure to recognize</page><page sequence="15">William McQueen 103 an obvious truth, is the grand example in Raphael's discourse on obedience. The account of Satan's fall is an exemplum, a "terrible Example," to Adam as the final words of Book VI emphatically declare, . . . let it profit thee to have heard By terrible Example the reward Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress. (VI, 909-I2) The warfare in Heaven gives cosmic dimension to the spiritual war in which Adam and every man must participate. It is an enactment on a colossal scale of the analogous battle which Adam must fight against Satan (or against the aspects of himself which Satan represents) within his own soul. Satan can, to some degree, be seen as analogous to fallen man, yet his fall, experienced vicariously by Adam and the reader in Raphael's account of the battle, is admonitory, and he is characterized in such a way as to negate any sympathy for him that may remain from the earlier books. He is coarsened more in this book than anywhere else in the poem-just at the point of the most effective characterization of God in the poem, or rather just before that point, for the Godhead's response to the rebellion continues beyond Satan's expulsion and culminates in the account of the creation in the next book. The Son has proven himself "worthi- est to be Heir / Of all things," in an awesome display of destruc- tive power, but immediately in the next book he displays a corresponding-and superior-creative power. Satan is measur- ed against both. In the battle in Heaven, his destructive power has been overwhelmed by God's greater power. In his incursion into the new creation, a new antithesis emerges; in Book VII, in particular, Satan's destructive intent is implicitly contrasted with God's creativity. More importantly, however, God's crea- tive power is contrasted with his own destructive power which has just been displayed so vividly in Book VI-with Satan assimi- lating the negative emphasis and increasingly coming to represent the destructive bias of the action, draining away opprobrium</page><page sequence="16">104 Paradise Lost V, VI: The WFar in Heaven from God.5 Satan is increasingly identified with destruction, and God-again through his vice-gerent Son-with Creation. At the very core of the poem, discord is followed by harmony, destruction is countered by creation. University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill 5 W. B. C. Watkins anticipates this remark, although with a different emphasis, in An Anatomy of Milton's Verse (Baton Rouge, 195 5), pp. 79 ff. Watkins calls Satan "a lightning rod."</page></plain_text>
