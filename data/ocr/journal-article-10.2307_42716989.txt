PERRYMAN Happy hearts and happy faces, Happy play in grassy places, That is how in ancient ages, Children grew to Kings and Sages. Robert Louis Stevenson in this short poem expresses clearly and beautifully, as only a poet can, the main theme of this article - i.e., children learn to un- derstand their world and discover real- ity through dramatic play. We as adults need to re-examine our attitudes about play to see if in our hectic, rushed and harried post-sputnick lives we have come to distrust play and consider it a waste of precious time. Have we come to use words like testing, exploring, experimenting, or even ma- nipulating, in preference to the word "play"? How easily and honestly are we able to say "I would like to play with this idea or thing so that I can get the feel of it and understand it bet- ter"? Or do we feel more comfortable when we say "I'll need to test it out. I want to explore its dimensions and ex- periment with it so that I can under- stand it more fully." We must remember that play is all of these things: testing, exploring, ex- perimenting and manipulating, with the added dimension of being a self Â«direct- ed, spontaneous activity which the play- er does with complete involvement. None of us will deny that we learn best when we do a task because we want to do it, we choose to do it, and we do it with a whole-hearted spirit. This is why children, and adults too, perhaps, learn best through play. Theories of Play But what really, is play, and more specifically, what is dramatic play? Play is a complex phenomenon composed of many variables. It appears in many guises and a great variety of forms. Its results are so subtle and far-reaching that any one definition or explanation will of necessity be partial and incom- plete. The whole truth regarding play is still unknown. It appears to be inti- mately related to the whole phenome- non of life itself, and only as the com- Lucile C. Perryman is Assistant Director of the Teacher Education Di- vision of Bank Street College of Education, New York City. She re- ceived her U.A. degree from the University of Californnia, Berkeley and her M. Ed. in Child Development from Mills College, Oakland, California. She has done graduate work in Education at Leland Stanford University, California and Teachers College, Columbia University, New York. Mrs. Perryman has had experience as a public school teacher (Kindergarten through 6th grade), a special teacher in Dance and Art and as a teacher of two and three year olds in a war nursery. plex processes of growth and develop- ment are unravelled and understood will a clearer, more accurate theory of play be evolved. Schiller-Spencer One of the oldest and best known theories of play is the Schiller-Spencer surplus-energy theory. It is the com- mon-sense answer to, "Why do children play?" Shorn of its scientific terminol- ogy it says that children play because they have to, in order to work off their surplus energies or tensions. In essence Spencer says that at any time a man or animal finds he does not need all of his energies in the struggle for his survival, he will use his surplus energies in play. Moreover, the form the play takes will be a simulation of those activities which are needed by the player in his survival struggle. (1) Those of us who work with children see many examples of play that appear to be the result of draining off excess energy. Further, we see many examples of imitative or simulated adult activity which represent basic survival activi- ties such as cooking and marketing and caring for babies or mock fighting and combat. Yet this explanation of play as surplus energy leaves us unsatisfied, and with a desire to go behind the scenes more deeply. 185</page><page sequence="2">September, 1962 Patrick G. T. Patrick, building on the ideas of Morritz Lazarus, proposed a dia- metrically opposite theory of play in his book "The Psychology of Relaxa- tion". (2) Patrick explains play as the demands of the higher cerebral centers for relaxation. Play is the restorer, the conserver of energy, not the drainer of surplus energy. It is not hard to find examples of recre- ational play in either children or adults. When we grow fatigued from imposed tasks we turn easily to other activities to which we can give ourselves in whole-hearted abandon and emerge re- freshed despite what appears to be an enormous expediture of energy. It is not at all apparent however, that we can explain this whole phenomenon solely on the central nervous system's demand for relaxation. Gross Karl Gross also believed that the Schiller-Spencer surplus energy the- ory of play was incomplete and he turn- ed his attention to a more penetrating analysis of play. Gross concluded that play was a basic instinct or as we would say, a basic need, of all higher forms of life. He described an instinct as a com- plex act mostly connected with the or- ganism's struggle for life and the pres- ervation of the species. He believed that in lower animals there was no true play, for it was not needed in their struggle for survival. In lower forms of life where the newborn is able to do almost everything the mature mem- ber of the species can do within hours or days after its birth, there is no need to practice in simulated play situations the activities the animal will need to perform as an adult. Gross put it into these words, "Children do not play be- cause they are young, but they are young in order that they may play." (3) Gross also saw play as a safety valve for the expression of pent-up emotions. This doctrine of catharsis was to be picked up and more fully developed by Sigmund Freud. Spencer also hinted at the notion that some forms of play were a type of compensation when he described mimic chase and fighting ac- tivities and games as an "ideal satsfac- tion for the destructive instinct in the absence of any real satisfaction for them." (4) Freud Sigmund Freud expressed these ideas in his dissertation "Beyond the Pleasure Principle." Freud advanced the the- ory that man's basic desire was "in- stinct gratification" and that lack of gratification, or frustration of basic in- stincts, gives rise to numerous substi- tute activities. These substitute activ- ities occur under the domination of the pleasure principle, i.e., that all organ- isms seek pleasure and avoid pain. Thus play can in large measure be accounted for as compensatory pleasure-seeking behavior. In Freud's words, "When basic instincts are frustrated, the or- ganism resorts to play as an outlet or substitute." (5) This explanation of play has proven most heuristic and although individual writers today may depart from a pure Freudian point of view, they agree that play can be the mirror of the child's inner world. Through his play, a child reveals many of his problems, his satis- factions, his strengths and weaknesses and his individual needs. Further, they agree that play can heal sick minds and bodies, and prevent the build-up of dangerous and destructive emotions. Dewey John Dewey also was concerned with play. He did not agree with Freud's theory that play was basically com- pensatory behavior tied to the individ- ual's seeking of pleasure and avoidance of pain. Dewey believed play was an expression of the natural urge of all living things to be active. He stated, "When the myth of natural quiescence is surrendered with its accompanying myth of the need of a special premium in order to arouse an inert agent, it ceases to be necessary to search for any special object in order to account for play. It is enough to say that action is basic to all living organisms and this need for action gives rise to play." (6) Play from this point of view is a natural part of all normal growth and develop- ment and the maturational level of the player will influence the form the play will take. Dramatic Play Let us now turn to dramatic play in 186</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Nursery Education particular. This form of play is engag- ed in spontaneously by children in the early childhood years, roughly between the ages of three and seven. In this kind of play the child imitates and re- lives various experiences he has had. In his play the child becomes the object or person he is trying to understand. As the child plays at being a mother, father, groceryman, policeman or even a fire truck, airplane or boat, he begins to know what these people and objects in his life represent and what his re- lationships to them are. As he plays he seeks more words to express his growing understandings. In his dramatic play the child has many opportunities to test out his new- found words and learn their power. From his verbalizations he begins to develop a schematization or frame of reference. As Joseph Church explains in his book "Language and the Discov- ery of Reality," (7) verbal expression helps tie the environment together into a coherent, familiar, dependable whole, against which the child can test subse- quent experiences. In dramatic play the child sees the need for written symbols as well as ver- bal ones, and he begins to use them. The child playing motorman or truck driver begins to make and read signs which say "Go," "Stop," "Dead End," "One Way." The child playing grocer or shopper makes and reads labels as he sells and buys merchandise. He begins to count, add and subtract and make change. The child playing mother or father in the house writes a letter and makes a shopping list. In this way the child grows easily into the use of sym- bols, which help him in sorting and ar- ranging all his perplexing perceptions of the real world. Play Nurtures Language and Thought In his dramatic play the child is un- afraid to test out his ideas, knowledge and feelings. By the manipulation of the symbols he uses in his play he is able to rearrange situations which in reality might resist such reorganization. Those who have studied children's thinking or cognitive development have recognized the symbolic and social na- ture of the thinking process as well as the close relationship existing between language and thought. David H. Rus- sell expressed this relation in these words, "There is little disagreement among philosophers or psychologists about the close relationship between language and most thinking - both tend to be directed toward some goal or con- clusion, both exhibit symptoms of searching for related materials and both involve some sort of integrative pattern- ing." (8) Jean Piaget was one of the first to explore the language and thought of the young child. He concluded that language and thought development followed a rather strict chronological serial order, moving from a pre-verbal sensory-motor stage to an egocentric animistic stage of monologues and col- lective monologues, and finally to a so- cial, rational and logical stage. (9) Pi- aget makes a distinction between the egocentric speech and thought of the child and the social, rational, logical speech and thought of the adult. Some writers have challenged this concept and feel there is no such sharp distinc- tion. Joseph Church expressed it very well when he said, "The most sophisti- cated adults in their every day lives, and especially in personal matters, show evidence of egocentrism, of realism, of anthropomorphism and animism, of in- stability and inconsistency and of fail- ures of symbolization."(10) It does seem, however, that children's rational thinking is governed somewhat by their maturation level, particularly in the areas of space and time. But one must realize that logical thought does not develop automatically by the sheer passing of time; if it is to develop, it must be nurtured and guided. As we have seen in dramatic play all the nec- essary ingredients are present for the development of rational thought. There are opportunities for countless first- hand experiences with objects and peo- ple where the child can bring all of his senses into play in order to get accurate perceptions. There are opportunities to use words in connection with experi- ences and to build a verbal frame of reference or schemata, which will help the child organize his past experiences and will mobilize him for future exper- iences. 187</page><page sequence="4">September, 1962 Role of the Teacher An important difference between spontaneous dramatic play in school, and free dramatic play in the home or back yard is in the guidance which the teacher can and should give. The teach- er provides the props and environment that will suggest the topic and direction of the play. At appropriate times the teacher should introduce new materials, equipment and experiences which will move the play toward certain desired educational goals. The teacher knows what new experiences and materials will be needed by keeping alert to all the child says and does as he plays. By providing time after play for question- ing, answering and discussing what has happened, telling and listening to re- lated stories, going on trips to nearby places to gain more concrete exper- iences, and viewing pictures and films which are visual symbols of those con- crete experiences, the teacher provides the child with opportunities to exercise his growing cognitive powers. This helps him to increase his skill in ob- servation, to be more discriminating and to make more logical generaliza- tions. The teacher must also help the child in every way possible to gain greater understanding and confidence in himself and his relationships to his environment. It is this concept of self which will ultimately free the child to revise his immature ideas and move on to more mature and rational thought. Dramatic play can be a powerful tool for cognitive development when it is guided by an adult who uses critical and creative language and is symbol- minded. References 1.
