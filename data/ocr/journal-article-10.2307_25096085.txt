<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CHAUCER CHEST AND THE PARDONER'S TALE: DIDACTICISM IN NARRATIVE ART by Muriel Whitaker The existence of the front panel from a medieval chest decorated with scenes from Chaucer's the Pardoner's Tale (the Canterbury Tales) first became publicly known in 1972, when the London Museum included it in an exhibition, Chaucer's London. Its then owner had acquired the panel from an interior decorator who, in turn, had found it in an old Suffolk house. Nothing else is known of its provenance. In 1971 it had caught the eye of M. D. Anderson (Lady Trenchard Cox), one of England's leading authorities on English medieval woodcarving. She recognized the panel's significance and dated it ca. 1400-1410, but neither she nor any other specialist has produced a scholarly study. In 1975 the panel was acquired (accession number 75.2) for the collections of the new Museum of London, formed by the amalgamation of the London Museum and the Guild Hall Museum.1 In 1987 it formed part of the Royal Academy exhi bition Age of Chivalry.2 The panel, measuring 99 cm. in length x 49 cm. in width x 4 cm. in depth, is the right hand part of a large coffer front which would have been connected by lar&gt;joint to a left-hand portion. Traces of the original poly chromy remain in the interstices. In both ecclesiastical and domestic set tings chests were indispensable pieces of furniture between the twelfth and fifteenth centuries particularly. Records indicate that they were used in cathedrals, chapels, and parish churches for storing torches, candles, orna ments, lengths of silk and linen, embroidered vestments, furs, jewels, books, and coins, inter alia. Domestically, they held, in addition to many of the pre ceding items, arms and armor, grain, bread, kitchen spices, tools, glass win dows, saddles, harness, alabaster, goffering irons for making wafers, herbs, medicines, and even, according to the Duke of Burgundy's accounts for 1372-73, venison to be salted. Oak was the most valued wood for their con struction, though walnut, poplar, pine, fir, and spruce chests have survived.3 Unusually, the Chaucer chest is made of elm, a less desirable material because, as the panel shows, it was hospitable to woodworm.

The front of a large chest would provide a space where individual scenes could be ordered from left to right, as in a comic strip, to effect a temporal nar rative progress. It is not difficult to reconstruct from Chaucer's text the three scenes that would have decorated the chest's left-hand panel. The first would have shown three young men drinking in a tavern, listening, perhaps, to the boy's report of their friend's death. Then, setting out from the village, they meet the Old Man, who points them to the oak where they will "fynde Deeth." In the third scene they discover the trea sure?"of floryns fyne of gold ycoyned rounde / Wei ny an eighte busshels" (770-71). Moving on to the extant right-hand panel, we see the youngest "rio tour," who has been allotted the trip to town to buy bread and wine. He stands outside a shop, holding in each hand a flask. These are the "large botelles" borrowed from the man in the next street, after the conspira tor has visited the apothecary. Now, tainted with poison, they contain wine destined for his "felawes." For the sake of clarity, the designer omits the third bottle, which the plotter "kept clene for his drynke." The shop keeper looks out from the ground floor of a multi-storied, tall, narrow building, like those of Flanders, which combined commercial premises, living accommodation, and storage.5 The steep roof is shingled, the low est windows are barred. The figure and building are set on the base line. Scene two takes place in the forest, as several clumps of stylized leaves suggest. Set a little above the base line, it depicts the murder of the youngest. The "shrew" behind him on his left has already plunged a dag ger into the youth's temple while his companion with upraised weapon prepares to "ryve hym thurgh the sydes." A sense of violent energy is gen erated by the tumbling bottie and the swinging sleeves; the victim's hand is raised to ward off the blow, while his legs bend and his body, thrown off balance, collapses. Scene three is placed in the panel's upper right corner, with the con spirators' headdresses touching the edges of the picture plane. Acting on the suggestion "Now lat us sitte and drynke, and make us merie," the men take their places behind a table, set with two (not three) knives and trenchers, two uneaten rounds of bread, a half loaf, and a single goblet. One rioter guzzles wine from the "botel ther the poyson was." The other man, having already tasted the wine, with loosened houppelande and closing eyes falls away from the table, proving the poison's efficacy, as the apothecary had guaranteed:</page><page sequence="4">MURIEL WHITAKER 177 "In al this world there is no creature That eten or dronken hath of this confiture Noght but the montance of a corn of whete, That he ne shal his lif anon forlete; Ye, sterve he shal, and that in lasse while Than thou wolt goon a paas nat but a mile, This poysoun is so strong and violent." (861-67) Scenes one and two and scenes two and three are separated by a semi circular pile of bagged coins placed at the upper edge of the pictorial space, each marked with a cross to represent in simplified form the cross which decorated the reverse of English pennies and groats (silver coins worth fourpence) in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries.6 Contrasting with the specificity of the coins, the second device used as space dividers?stylized clumps of vegetation?derives from a long tradition of manuscript illumination. Vegetation conventionally indicates a forest set ting, itself a place of physical and moral testing. Dodging behind one clump of foliage is a hunting fox. In the treatment of space the chest seems a transitional piece, retain ing some features of thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century style while embracing the greater realism of International Gothic, which emerged in England after 1380.7 For example, the first scene of the youngest man shopping in the town delimits the spatial depth by pushing the images to the front of the picture plane and adhering to the old manuscript fash ion of making the most important figure unrealistically large, while the minor figures are dwarfish. The two-dimensional treatment of the picnic table is also problematic. Seen from the characters'?not the specta tors'?point of view, it defies the laws of gravity by seeming to hover in midair. However, there are signs that the rediscovery of perspective8 has had some impact on the designer, particularly in relation to costume, where the long diagonals of the sleeves, the tilting headdresses, and the padded chests add depth. What strikes the viewer particularly is the sophistication of the cos tumes; they are not what one would expect three young louts in a village tavern to wear. "Half elegantly French and half realistically Flemish,"9 like those in the Limbourg brothers' calendar for the Tr?s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry (ca. 1411), Gaston Phoebus' Livre de Chasse (ca. 1407), and the Devonshire Hunting Tapestries (ca. 1430), they relate to an Inter national Gothic milieu where the art of costume was a colorful aspect of personality.10 A change of fashion in the mid-fourteenth century replaced the older style surcoat with garments that had inset sleeves, an improve ment that made close-fitting garments possible. From 1360 to about 1410</page><page sequence="5">178 THE CHAUCER REVIEW7 men were wearing very short, tight doublets (paltoks), to which were attached tight hose that drew attention to a shapely leg, and long shoes with pointed toes (poulaines). The padded doublet's egg-shaped chest was a basic structure until 1410-20. Over the doublet was a houppelande, a flamboyant gown of varying length that was a sine qua non of fashionable men: "No man of any social pretensions was without one," says costume historian Margaret Scott.11 The gown's most extravagant feature from 1390-1410 was the great trumpet-shaped sleeve known as a bombarde (can non) sleeve. Headcoverings were also exuberant. Instead of the hood being worn in the usual way, the face opening was placed about the head, while the pleated shoulder cape was held in position by wrapping the long tail around the entire head. Our revellers, then, display the epitome of aristocratic style ca. 1400 A.D. The doublet revealed beneath the dead man's houppelande in the upper right corner is sufficiently padded to produce a three-dimensional effect. The houppelande 's stand-up collar is high enough to touch the fashionably curled hair. Both doublet and houppelande are sufficiently short to confirm the characters' masculinity. The sleeves are dagged (slashed) along the edges to provide additional movement. The long slender legs enclosed in close-fitting, unwrinkled hose and the slightly upturned elongated shoes convey youth and agility. The youngest is dis tinguished by being bareheaded, a detail that facilitates the blow to his skull. One man wears an elaborate cornette en quatre, while the other and the shopkeeper have flipped the cape forward so that it protrudes in a bag shape over their faces. Weaponry is a costume adjunct essential to plot development in the Pardoner's Tale. While the youngest is fetching food and drink from town, the worst of the rioters instructs his companion: "Looke whan that he is set, that right anoon Arys as though thou woldest with hym pleye, And I shal ryve hym thurgh the sydes tweye Whil that thou strogelest with hym as in game, And with thy daggere looke thou do the same." (826-30) The weapons depicted on the panel represent a type known as a "kidney dagger" or a "ballock-knife" because of the twin lobes where the handle pins the blade. They were, says John Clark, "very much fashionable civil ian wear, not military weapons." Daggers of this type, dating from the fourteenth to early sixteenth century, are to be found in the Museum of London collections;12 also, they appear on monumental English brasses such as that of two civilians at King's Somborne, Hants (ca. 1380) and in</page><page sequence="6">MURIEL WHITAKER 179 early fifteenth-century manuscript illuminations like the January scene in the Tr?s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, where they are thrust into the belt pouches of the elegant courtiers occupying the foreground. In dressing the men so foppishly, the artist undoubtedly intended to express not only extravagant examples of current fashion but also an atti tude of disapproval common throughout the later Middle Ages.13 Such English preachers as Master Rypon of Durham, Thomas Brunton of Rochester, and the English Dominican John Bromyard, all of them Chaucer's contemporaries, denounced the incitement to lust occasioned by men who wore garments so short that their private parts were barely covered; the arrogance of the social climber who imitated his superiors by wearing "a costli gown with bagges hangynge to his kne?and an hood on his heved, with a thousande ragges on his tipet; and gaili hosid an schood as thouz it were a squyer of cuntre;"14 and the expense of acquir ing finery with money that should have gone to the poor. When Chaucer's Parson, in his disquisition on the sin of Pride, attacks "superfluitee of clothynge," he echoes current criticisms: "the synful costlewe array," the "wast of clooth in vanitee," "the horrible disordinat scantnesse of cloth ing, as been thise kutted sloppes, or haynselyns, that thurgh hire short nesse ne covere nat the shameful membres of man, to wikked entente" (the Parson's Tale, 416ff.). In a period when Edward Ill's sumptuary laws regulated dress for various classes, the rioters' garments represent both a sin and a crime. The moral degradation implicit in the rioters'clothing is explicit in their facial expressions. An important aspect of International Gothic art was the degree to which realistic portraiture replaced the conventional faces, pretty and serene, of thirteenth- and early fourteenth-century paint ing and sculpture. On the Chaucer panel the youngest man looks slyly out of the corner of his eye as he accepts the wine bottles. A frown and the pursing of thick lips under a flat nose accompany the murderer's plunging dagger, but the mouth sags and the eyes close when the poi soned wine takes effect on this villain. The third man, meanwhile, pig gishly swills wine from the bottle that had remained upright in scene two. All three have flabby, self-indulgent, brutish countenances with no inti mation of joy or contentment. Medieval aesthetic theory regarded phys ical features as a sign of a person's moral condition.15 The importance of costume and physiognomy becomes clear when we realize that the narrative's didactic message must be conveyed not, as in the text, by the Pardoner's eloquent words but entirely by evocative images which, through the operation of recognition and memory, would enable the viewer, though unfamiliar with the Pardoner's Tale, to interpret the panel's figurative discourse. Medieval art in general depended on an "acquired language of metaphor" so that the images worked, as Rosemond</page><page sequence="7">180 THE CHAUCER REVIEW Tuve explains, "at a deep associative level. . . reiterating their burden of more meant than is seen."16 On the conjectural left panel, the richly dressed youths drinking in the tavern, "the develes temple," would arouse the expectation of evil deeds, while implying the deadly sins of Pride and Gluttony. The finding and acquisition of the treasure trove, no part of which is shared with the Old Man (Cupidity's corresponding Virtue being Charity),17 would bring to mind the biblical warning, the Pardoner's actual text: Radix malorum est cupiditas. To the beginning of the verse, "For the love of money is the root of all evil," St. Paul added, "which while some coveted after, they have erred from the faith, and pierced them selves through with many sorrows" (I Timothy 6:10). The text was par ticularly appropriate to late medieval society because the Church, targeting a merchant class that had become wealthy through trade, had given Cupidity (Avarice) precedence over Pride as the deadliest of sins.18 John Bromyard, substantiating Chaucer, viewed clergy and lay people as equally guilty in their pursuit of money: "In all lands it slays and makes alive, it leads forth to the infernal regions and brings back, it opens and shuts the prisons, it slays the souls that are not dead, and gives life to those that are not living."19 He adds that if the higher ranks of the Church cared more for souls than for collecting money, there would be fewer adulterers, usurers, perjurers, and lechers among clergy and people. In the extant panel the oversized bag of heaped coins placed promi nently above the scene of the wine purchase and again between the mur der of the youngest rioter and the poisoning deaths of the other two indicates that cupiditas has motivated the actions of the three characters and brought about their deaths. In Chaucer's text, the worst of the men articulates their common attitude: "This tr?sor hath Fortune unto us yiven In myrthe andjoliftee oure lyf to lyven, And lightly as it comth, so wol we spend." (779-81) Each plots to increase his own share despite their oaths on God's bones to "bicomen otheres brother." Iconographically, coins heaped in chests, bags, or purses are signs of cupidity, as swords and daggers are of anger (ira) and wine vessels of gluttony (gula). In this particular visual narra tive, the recurrent motif of the flasks functions as a reminder that the search for Death began with the drinking of wine in a tavern where "the yonge folk that haunteden folye . . . doon the devel sacrifice," that it was central to the youngest conspirator's plan, while providing the others with an excuse for sending him away, and that it ensured the death of all three characters.</page><page sequence="8">MURIEL WHITAKER 181 These flasks that act as signs are also an aspect of the panel's realism. Though no medieval vessels surviving today in museums exactly replicate this combination of foot, flattened oval body with attached handles, and long neck, a miniature in an illustrated manuscript of Gaston Phoebus's Livre de Chasse (Paris, Biblioth?que Nationale, MS fr. 616, f. 67) explains the form. In the miniature, the participants in a stag hunt are picnicking in the forest; by means of a rope attached to the handles, a vessel similar to those on the chest dangles into the water of a nearby spring, cooling the wine that it, no doubt, contains. The manuscript is dated ca. 1407, contemporaneous with the chest. As well, an attached cord would allow the traveller to carry the con tainer (also known as a costrel or a pilgrim-flask) dangling from his neck or his belt. The fact that the carver pictures the rioters' vessels as square (that is, hexagonal or octagonal) indicates that they are made of a metal, probably pewter.20 Chaucer's text does not directly account for one prominent image in the pictorial space?the hunting fox in the lower right corner (the lower left, from an internal perspective). On the literal level of meaning, the fox was a natural inhabitant of the medieval forest, one that was regularly hunted.21 But the medieval Christian, trained by church art, preaching, plays, pageantry, and oral and written literature, would recognize this fox as an allegorical image operating on several levels. From the Greek fables of Aesop, through the early Christian Physiologus to the medieval Bestiaries the fox had the moral significance of deceit,22 a vice associated with cupidity. The characterization of the fox in the twelfth-century Latin Bestiary (Cambridge University Library MS II.4.26, f. 16) which T. H. White translated, begins by describing, in Physiologus style, the animal's habit of rolling in blood-like mud and playing dead until birds are deceived into sitting on his body, thus becoming his prey.23 The author goes on to explicate the Christian truth which the natural history implies: The Devil has the nature of this same. With all those who are liv ing according to the flesh he feigns himself to be dead until he gets them in his gullet and punishes them. . . . Furthermore, those who wish to follow the devil's works perish, as the Apostle says: "Know this, since if you live after the flesh you shall die, but if you mortify the doings of the foxy body according to the spirit you shall live." And the Lord God says: "They will go into the lower parts of the earth, they will be given over to the power of the word, they will become a portion for foxes."24 The panel's fox, eagerly sniffing out his prey, is significantly placed in the area of the pictorial plane conventionally reserved for representa tions of hell in medieval art and drama.25 The spectators would make</page><page sequence="9">182 THE CHAUCER REVIEW7 the connection between the hunting fox (Devil), the damned rioters, and the Devil's particular territory, the destination of sinners in Last Judgment scenes. That the poet, speaking in the sermonizing Pardoner's voice, recognized the Devil's involvement the text makes clear. It was "the feend, oure enemy" who put the idea of poison into the youngest man's mind because "the feend foond him in swich lyvynge / That he hadde leve him to sorwe brynge" (847-48). In the opinion of Martin Stevens and Kathleen Falvey, the Pardoners Tale contains "Chaucer's most graphic representation of a godless world."26 Finally, an internationally popular romance which inspired a remark able amount of English art might have led a spectator, aware of the Chaucer chest's literary source, to identify the fox with the Pardoner him self. In Renart le Contrefait (Reynard the Deceiver), an early fourteenth-cen tury branch of the Roman de Renart (ca. 1170-1250),27 the central character is a preaching fox, an anthropomorphic beast marred by the sins of deceitfulness, lust, gluttony, vanity and, particularly, hypocrisy. The holy man, comments Kenneth Varty in Reynard the Fox: A Study of the Fox in Medieval English Art, was "one of the commonest roles played by Reynard in order to gull his intended prey, or inflict an injury on an enemy."28 Misericords, bench ends, roof bosses, elbow rises, pulpits, capitals, friezes, paving stones, church furniture, poppy heads, lecterns, and organ lofts testify to the ubiquity of the motif which combined a fox in some form of clerical dress with an audience of gullible geese, chickens, or ducks. It was a powerful vehicle for lay satire directed at clerics, particularly the itiner ants.29 The Pardoner describes to the other pilgrims how "I stonde lyk a clerk in my pulpet, And whan the lewed peple is doun yset, I pr?che so as ye han herd bifoore And telle an hundred false japes moore." (391-94) He typifies the corrupt churchmen whom the carvers felt safe in criti cizing under the guise of art. What relationship exists between the Chaucer chest and other works of art produced in England between ca. 1390 and 1410? In the period when the International Gothic Style became dominant in Western Europe, patronage was the major influence in creating works of art. Patrons imposed on their craftsmen "a certain tone, a certain courtly ele gance, in harmony with their personal tastes."30 This was the period of such great continental illuminated manuscripts as the numerous Books of Hours produced for Jean, Duke of Berry, including the Tr?s Belles Heures (Brussels, Biblioth?que Royale, MS 11060-61) and the Petites</page><page sequence="10">MURIEL WHITAKER 183 Heures (Paris, Biblioth?que Nationale, MS lat. 18014); the Italian Romance of Guiron le Courtois (Paris, Biblioth?que Nationale, nouv. acq. fr. 5243); the Dutch Biblia Pauperum (London, British Library, MS Kings 5) and Gaston Pho?bus' Livre de Chasse (Paris, Biblioth?que Nationale, ms. fr. 616). However, English manuscript production lagged because, saysj. J. G. Alexander, English artists, lacking patrons to provide encouragement, interest, and financial support, failed to accept the new treatment of space and the new realism.31 The limitations of English secular illumi nation are obvious in a work almost exactly contemporary with the Chaucer chest, the manuscript ca. 1400 containing the works known as "Sir Gawain and the Green Knight," "Pearl," "Patience," and "Purity" (London, British Library, MS Cotton Nero Ax. Art. 3). The illustrations painted in primary colors?red, yellow, blue?have been described as "caricatures," "infantile daubs," and "naive and crude . . . carelessly painted in dull, muddy colours."32 Such denigration does not apply to other crafts. The Wilton Diptych, painted in the mid-1390s, showing his sponsors King Edmund, Edward the Confessor and John the Baptist presenting Richard II to the Virgin and Child, is a work of inarguable beauty and sophistication.33 Architecture provided the busiest arena for craftsmen as kings, nobles, and merchants enriched by the textile trade spent fortunes on building or improving everything from palaces, castles, and colleges to cathedrals, chantries, and parish churches.34 The ravaging Black Death, which had swept across England in 1348-56, 1361-62, 1376, and 1379, had greatly reduced the number of craftsmen, for they tended to live in crowded lodgings and work in confined spaces where infection spread rapidly.35 Woodcarvers were in particular demand to execute choir stalls, bench ends, angel ceilings, bosses, screens, and furnishings. To make up the deficiency, carvers were recruited from the Continent, particularly from Flanders, where the Antwerp-London commercial link was well estab lished. They were lured, it is said, by the promise of good beer, soft beds, and pretty girls.36 Flemish influences are particularly observable in several chests surviv ing from this period; for example, a chest in the Chapter House of York Minster decorated in high relief with the story of St. George and the dragon (ca. 1380); late fourteenth- and early fifteenth-century chests at Wath (moved there from Jervaulx Abbey), Brancepath in Northum berland, Derby, and Chevington, Suffolk; a Nativity chest in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; and a slightly earlier chest at Alnwick Castle, decorated with hunting scenes.37 They share with the Chaucer chest such Flemish traits as a narrative decorative programme, a disordered field holding several episodes in the same plane, an arrangement in registers and the use of color. Various considerations?the English</page><page sequence="11">184 THE CHAUCER REVIEW craftsman's ability to absorb Continental styles, the common sharing of pattern books, the anonymity of craftsmen, and the peripatetic nature of their work?militate against specific attributions. The majority opinion concerning the northern chests favors English execution, perhaps cen tred on a workshop in York.38 In the case of the Chaucer chest, the fact that the literary source is an English text originating in London argues strongly for English origins, but, as Flemings congregated particularly in the East Midlands, their participation cannot be excluded. The panel's realistic street scene, so similar to streets in Bruges and Tournai, may rep resent a Flemish designer's personal memory operating in response to Chaucer's text: "In Flaundres whilom was a compaignye / Of yonge folk that haunteden folye" (463-64). The point to be made is that there was available in England a pool of highly skilled woodcarvers at the time when the Chaucer chest was created. One of the problems related to analysing the Chaucer chest's decora tive pattern is to discover a source for the costumes. Medieval wood carvers, like those who created the misericords, generally derived their subjects from illustrated books39?a Biblia Pauperum, Bestiaries, the Speculum Humanae Salvationis, calendars in Books of Hours, romances, the Reynard cycle, supplemented by scenes and characters from miracle plays and observations from real life. No surviving wood carvings repli cate the rioters' costumes. Tristan, in "Tryst beneath the tree" misericords at Lincoln Cathedral and Chester Cathedral, wears a short doublet, hose, and pointed shoes, but the sleeves are close-fitting. The "Gawain and the Green Knight" manuscript (London, British Library, MS Cotton Nero Ax. Art. 3 f. 94) shows King Arthur wearing a long gown with fur-trimmed bombarde sleeves, while Gawain, having decapitated the Green Knight, is seen in a short red houppelande with bag sleeves, hose, and elongated shoes. In f. 126, the first exchange of winnings, he wears a rather longer houppelande combined with mi-parti hose while Bercilak has bombarde sleeves and a long gown. These costumes are as fashionably up-to-date as those on the panel but are so badly executed that they cannot have served as models. And Continental fashion dictated that bombarde sleeves be set in calf-length or full-length gowns, judging by manuscript illustrations. One English manuscript, however, does contain costume illustrations comparable in sophistication and style to those of the Chaucer chest: the Ellesmere manuscript of Chaucer's Canterbury Tales (San Marino, Calif.: Huntington Library, MS 26 C9). At the beginning of the Squires Tale, the manuscript's major illuminator has depicted a young man mounted on a prancing horse, the outline of which has been traced on the vellum with a stylus. The most elegantly dressed of all the pilgrims, the Squire wears a very short green houppelande with red-lined bombarde sleeves,</page><page sequence="12">MURIEL WHITAKER 185 padded chest, and ermine trim, tight-fitting white hose decorated at the thigh with ermine tails, long pointed poulaines, and spurs. The horse's lively motion sets the Squire's sleeves flying out behind him, an effect that the murderous attack on the youngest rioter also achieves. Other indications of the Squire's social status and fashionable taste are the houppelande's white floral embroideries?a response to the text's "Embroidered was he, as it were a meede / Al ful of fresshe floures, whyte and reede"?and the chain belt from which dangle tinkling bells. This fashion accent the Duke of Touraine had initiated in 1389. Christine de Pisan describes the effect in "Le dit de la pastoure" (1403), when a cav alcade of knights sets the woods echoing with "les cliquetes sonnans."40 As in the representation of the rioters, the Squire's high collar touches his "lokkes crulle." His fair hair, blue eyes, and small red mouth indicate his virtuous nature as the avaricious youths' coarse faces signify their sin fulness. Though the Squire wears a tall blue hat of a type seen in French manuscripts at the turn of the century, his father's chaperon is formed from a hood with two tubes projecting over his face while the remaining part of the tail falls across his shoulder (a liripipe). Chaucer also wears a headdress formed from a cape, similar to those on the panel. Thus the two works share a commonality of costume design. Kathleen L. Scott's recent research on English manuscripts produced between ca. 1395 and 141041 has led her to conclude that the Ellesmere manuscript was made in a master limner's London shop "in a period beginning in or just after 1400 and ending no later than 1405,"42 an ear lier dating than that previously assigned. It is not entirely impossible that the Chaucer chest's designer might have seen it or even shared pattern books with the Ellesmere illustrators.43 Again venturing into hypothesis, we ask, finally, who might have com missioned the Chaucer chest? It must have been someone who knew the Pardoner's Tale either through access to a written text or, perhaps, through having heard its author reading to an audience, as shown in the Troilus frontispiece (Cambridge, Corpus Christi, MS 61 fl.). Had a wealthy patron such as John of Gaunt or his third wife Katherine Swynford (Chaucer's sister-in-law)44 been the commissioner, durable oak rather than inferior elm would surely have been used. Could Chaucer himself have been the patron who ordered the chest? Thoroughly familiar with the text, he would have ensured the scrupulous adherence to the literary source that the pictorial narrative provides. His knowledge and use of allegorical imagery could have inspired the addi tion of the hunting fox to signify literally a forest animal, allegorically the Pardoner, tropologically the vice of deceit, and anagogically the devil. Having taken a fifty-three year lease of a house near the Lady Chapel of</page><page sequence="13">186 THE CHAUCER REVIEW Westminster Abbey on 24 December 1399, Chaucer may have needed new furniture, including a useful chest. At the same time, the delay in the payment of his annuities occasioned by Richard II's deposition and Henry IV's accession in 1399 may have left him so short of ready cash45 (as "The Complaint to His Purse" reveals) that elmwood rather than a more expensive material was chosen. As Clerk of the King's Works between 1389 and June 1391, charged with responsibility for the con struction and repair of ten royal residences and other properties, Chaucer would have had direct contact with woodcarvers and other craftsmen to the point where he could have been on friendly terms with one or more highly skilled individuals. Requiring work to be done for himself, he would have known where to look. And who could better have appreciated the irony of keeping his coins and other valuables in a piece of furniture that visually condemned cupidity while constantly remind ing its owner of gold's desirability by means of a pictured treasure placed where the eye would fall whenever the chest's lid was raised?

The gold florins of the text were originally Florentine coins embossed on one side with a large fleur-de-lys and on the other with the figure of John the Baptist. In 1344 Edward III issued English gold florins showing the king enthroned and, on the reverse, a small, ornate cross inside a quatrefoil. Within a year they were withdrawn, to be replaced by the noble, the chief English gold coin from 1344 to 1464. As it is unlikely that the Edwardian florins were still circulating at the end of the century, the artist's circle with a cross conveys the idea of a coin rather than, specifically, a florin, which was not marked with a cross. For this information about medieval coinage I am indebted to John Clark. 7. On Richard II and the International Gothic Style see Gervase Mathew, The Court of Richard II (London, 1968) and English Court Culture in the Later Middle Ages, ed. V J. Scattergood andj. W. Sherborne (London, 1983). In Erwin Panofsky's Early Netherlandish Painting: Its Origin and Character (New York and London, 1971), 2 vols., 1:67, the author describes the International Style as the "fusion of the Gothic as represented by the French, the Latin as represented by the Italians, and the Anglo-Germanic as chiefly represented by the Flemings; and when it spread to Germany, to Austria, to Spain, to England, to Flanders</page><page sequence="14">MURIEL WHITAKER 187 and was even back to Italy?the reflux from north to south beginning and steadily grow ing from ca. 1370-80?it did so, as it were, by way of multilateral repatriation." 8.

Chaucer recognized the connection between outward appearance and inward condition in the General Prologue to the Canterbury Tales by attributing physical imperfec tions to the morally flawed pilgrims; for example, the Monk's shiny bald head, the Cook's ulcerous skin, the Wife of Bath's gap teeth, the Pardoner's waxy hair and glaring eyes, and the Summoner's leprous face. 16.

In medieval England as well as on the Continent, hunting was an aristocratic duty and pleasure requiring that the participants observe a prescribed etiquette and use a spe cialized language enshrined in such English hunting manuals as William Twiti's The Art of Hunting (1327), Edward, Duke of York's The Master of Game (1406), adapted from Gaston Phoebus' Livre de Chasse (1387), and Dame Juliana Berners Boke of St. Albans (1496). A pop ular French manual, Les livres du roy Modus et de la royne Ratio (ca. 1338), combines detailed instructions for hunting various animals, excluding the fox, with Christian allegorizations. In art the fox is generally shown as hunter rather than as object of the hunt. 22. See Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, where Bercilak's fox trophy becomes a symbol of Gawain's deceit in failing to surrender the lady's girdle during the exchange of win nings.
