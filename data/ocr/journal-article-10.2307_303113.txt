<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dismembering and Disremembering in Nietzsche's "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" J. Hillis Miller In an essay in his early book, Studies on Hysteria, written with Josef Breuer, Sigmund Freud interjects the following parenthesis: (I am making use here of a number of similes, all of which have a very limited resemblance to my subject and which, moreover, are incompatible with one another. I am aware that this is so, and I am in no danger of over-estimating their value. But my purpose in using them is to throw light from different directions on a highly complicated topic which has never yet been represented. I shall therefore venture to continue in the following pages to introduce similes in the same manner, though I know this is not free from objection.)1 This is a curious passage in a number of ways. None of his similes (Gleichnissen),2 says Freud, has more than "a very limited resemblance (eine recht begrenzte Ahnlichkeit)" to what it names. What does this mean? Limited in what way? By being a distorted picture, or by being an allotropic trope, turning away from what it names and leading away from c 1981 by Princeton University Press, from The Linguistic Moment. 41</page><page sequence="2">it in its otherness? The similes, moreover, says Freud, are incompatible with one another. They cannot be reconciled in a single picture, however complicated a one. They are used in their heterogeneity "to throw light from different directions (von verschiedenen Seiten her zu veranschau- lichen)" on something, "a highly complicated topic (ein hochst kompliziertes... Denkobjekt)" which has never yet been "represented (dargestell//tes)." Just because this topic has never yet been represented would not seem a sufficient reason for not representing it directly, giving a photograph of this hitherto unknown place, so to speak. It seems that this place cannot be represented in this way, perhaps because of its complexity, perhaps because it has never been "represented" before and so lacks a proper name in any language, perhaps because it could by no means, at any time or place, in any language, ever be represented except tropologically, that is, improperly. It can for some reason only be represented, at this time at least, in figures. Freud's figure for this is the projecting of light from different directions on a dark object or place, a midnight crossroads, by different light sources. Each of these perhaps reveals a new aspect of the place. Perhaps the figurative nature of the images, the fact that each bears only a limited resemblance to its object, will be cancelled out by the proliferation of images. A full multidimensional picture of the object would then be produced, like those superimposed slightly different images that make stereoscopic vision. Perhaps. In any case, all Freud's later work is commanded by this necessity of multiple figurative models, each replacing the last. Why is it that Freud, for all his confidence, at the beginning of his career at least, in the objective existence of the pathogenic nucleus causing mental disorder, cannot avoid putting that existence in question, even in the Studies on Hysteria? He puts it in question by demonstrating repeatedly that it cannot be named literally, but only in figures that always break down and fail to figure adequately what they "represent." Why must Freud ultimately recognize that the center of the labyrinth of the mind is a place that can by no means, not even by figurative ones, be placed or named? The ultimate direction toward which Freud's exploration of his topographical figures in the Studies on Hysteria is leading is given not in this early book but in a more celebrated passage in The Interpretation of Dreams. Here Freud affirms that in a structure of this sort there is a center which can never by any means be reached or identified. This center is the source of the ramifying labyrinthine growth and yet it can never have any light shed on it: Even in the best interpreted dreams, there is often a place that must be left in the dark because in the process of interpreting, one notices a tangle (ein Kna'uel) of dream-thoughts arising, which resists unravelling but has also made no further contributions (keine weiteren 42</page><page sequence="3">Beitra'ge) to the dream-content. This is the dream's navel, the place where it straddles the unknown (dem Unerkannten aufsitzt). The dream-thoughts, to which interpretation leads one, are necessarily interminable (ohne Abschluss) and branch out on all sides into the netlike entanglement (in die netzartige Verstrickung) of our world of thought. Out of one of the denser places of this meshwork (Geflechts), the dream-wish rises like a mushroom out of its mycelium.3 The image here has at least a "limited resemblance" to that in the Studies on Hysteria, except that now Freud clearly recognizes that the center must necessarily remain unknown. It is impossible to give, whether literally or in figure. As a result, the dream-thoughts are a trap or netlike entanglement which can never be successfully unravelled. This is both because it branches out interminably in all directions and because its source can never be identified. That source is the origin of the net of dream-thoughts. Though it has made no further contributions to the dream-content beyond generating them in the first place, as mycelium generates mushroom, that initial contribution is enough to make the dream-thoughts an impenetrable and interminable entanglement. Within this net the interpreter may remain permanently trapped. Why is this so? Friedrich Nietzsche, in "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense," gives clear expression to the situation in which Freud finds himself. He also suggests reasons why that site cannot ever be clearly mapped. "Clear expression" must be qualified by saying that this clarity, for example in rational distinctions or in binary oppositions, is itself a trap for the unwary. In this it is like the entangling net of dream-thoughts in the passage from Freud's On the Interpretation of Dreams. Like Freud, Nietzsche cannot avoid becoming caught in the impasse he is attempting to describe. What seems at first so logical and rational in both cases breaks down into the illogical and irrational. It is a path to a blank wall the critic must in his own turn follow again if he goes far enough, not very far in fact. In the case of the two passages from Freud I have cited, if the reader allows himself to apply to Freud's texts the mode of interpretation the texts themselves recommend,4 he will not only find inconsistencies and contradictions. He will also come to recognize that Freud's apparent rational mastery of the use of figures to represent the psyche dissolves. It dissolves in such a way that his text ultimately comes to mean the opposite of what he seems to want it to mean. Instead of being based on a 43</page><page sequence="4">clear distinction between literal, scientific language and figurative representation, a distinction necessary to maintain the idea of the objective existence of the pathogenic nucleus in the ego, Freud's words circle around a gap which would be the clear recognition that the pathogenic nucleus is inaccessible except through the entanglements of figurative language. If this is the case, that nucleus is a permanently unknown X; it is neither thought, nor thing, nor word. This recognition the passage from The Interpretation of Dreams still to some degree evades by trying to claim that the blind spot of the unknowable at the center of each dream may be safely ignored by the masterful scientist presenting his theory of dreams. It may be ignored because it offers nothing further to the interpretation. In Nietzsche's case the binary oppositions, on which "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" is built, ultimately collapse in such a way that the essay turns back on itself and no longer makes consistent sense. This selfsubversion exemplifies in its opacity precisely what the essay attempts to bring to clear understanding. The binary oppositions in question include the oppositions between scientist and artist, waking and sleeping, truth and lie, remembering and forgetting, motion and stillness, reason and emotion, inside and outside, image and concept, literal and figurative language. The argument of Nietzsche's essay seems clear enough. He affirms that everything in the human world begins with an act of intuition or naming which is a metaphorical transposition of something outside human knowledge. This something remains necessarily unknown and unknowable. It is "the mysterious X (das ratselhafte X)."5 On the basis of these "perceptual metaphors (anschaulichen Metaphern)" (Eng., p. 84; Ger., p. 314), and by a complex series of further transpositions, each "a stammering translation (eine nachstammelnde Ubersetzung)" (Eng., p. 86; Ger., p. 316), each another false equivalence, man has built his complex conceptual, scientific, moral, and artistic structures: "To begin with, a nerve stimulus is transferred (ubertragen) into an image (ein Bild): first metaphor. The image, in turn, is imitated (nachgeformt) in a sound: second metaphor. And each time there is a complete overleaping (Uberspringen) of one sphere, right into the middle of an entirely new and different one" (Eng., p. 82; Ger., p. 312). Out of such unjustified leaps, in this process of "uber" and "nach," the airy structure of the human world is made. All the lines of causality, true equivalence, and necessary connection in such structures are cut by Nietzsche, so that their coherence is seen to be illusory, like a building made of fragments precariously balanced. Such a structure, in one of the metaphors of violence and mutilation which punctuate Nietzsche's essay, is said to be like a song concocted by a painter without hands to express what he sees but to 44</page><page sequence="5">which he cannot give a pictorial expression: "For between two absolutely different spheres, as between subject and object, there is no causality, no correctness, and no expression; there is, at most, an aesthetic relation (Verhalten): I mean a suggestive transference (eine andeutende Ubertragung) .... A painter without hands who wished to express in song the picture before his mind would, by means of this substitution (Vertauschung) of spheres, still reveal more about the essence of things than does the empirical world" (Eng., pp. 86-87; Ger., p. 317). The difference between science and art, for Nietzsche, is that the structures of the former are rapidly frozen and codified, taken as true, while the structures of the latter are based on fresh intuitive metaphors motivated by emotion. Man cannot cease to form new metaphors. His instinct to form them is, Nietzsche says, "the fundamental human drive, which one cannot for a single instant dispense with, for one would thereby dispense with man himself" (Eng., pp. 88-89; Ger., p. 319). The human world, for Nietzsche as for Freud, in their different ways, is a labyrinth of figurative displacements around an unknown center. What Nietzsche names "metaphor," "illusion," "transposition," or "dissimulation" is originally a catachresis. It replaces the unknown X with a sign which is neither literal nor figurative. In this it undermines the distinction between the truth of literal language and the lie of figurative language which is the foundation of Nietzsche's construction of the labyrinth of his essay. The image of the labyrinth appears in Nietzsche's language in this essay not as such but in closely related spatial forms. The edifice of concepts, for example, is "the construction of a pyramidal order according to castes and degrees, the creation of a new world of laws, privileges, subordinations, and clearly marked boundaries." This pyramid "displays the right regularity of a Roman columbarium," or it is like an astrological map dividing up the sky, or like a dice game, or like a spider web built on running water, or like a beehive made not of wax but of concepts that man has manufactured from himself (Eng., pp. 84-85; Germ., p. 315). The structure of metaphors solidified into concepts man has made is both as rigid and stonelike as the stratifications of a pyramid and yet as unreal as the astrological lines dividing the heavens. These imaginary lines have power, nevertheless, to conjure those ideas or things in themselves which seem to dwell behind every concept, for example in Platonism or in the long heritage of Platonic metaphysics. If the maze of concepts is as fixed as though it were of stone, at the same time it is as fragile, light, and resilient as a spiderweb. It may float on a stream or bend with the wind. For Nietzsche, as for W. B. Yeats, man is "lost amid the labyrinth that he has made/In art or politics,'"6 but it seems as if that labyrinth, constructed by man's extraordinary genius in architecture, is a safe habitation able "to bar that foul storm out" (Yeats, op. cit., I. 111). This is true even though man's house of words has been made of the false equivalences of 45</page><page sequence="6">metaphor, according to the universal concept that "every concept arises from the equation of unequal things (durch Gleichsetzen des Nichtgleichen)" (Eng., p. 83; Ger., p. 313). It seems as though the situation of man, the mazelike territory within which he dwells, and the boundary separating him from the mysterious X, the rushing stream on which he floats, has been accurately mapped at last. It might seem also that not only Nietzsche but man in general is safe. The image of the roaring stream may seem a little menacing, but the airy structure of concepts man has made will, it seems, protect him from the unknown. The X will be held at arm's length, where it is no danger, as in the image at the end of the essay of the Stoic philosopher protected by his cloak from the rain: "When a real storm cloud thunders above him, he wraps himself (hiult er sich) in his cloak, and with slow steps he walks from beneath it" (Eng., p. 91; Ger., p. 322). What of Nietzsche's own metaphors? Why is it that Nietzsche must use what he condemns? Why must he, like Freud or like Yeats, use a set of proliferating metaphors which are not quite congruent with one another? That he must use what he condemns is evident, since language, as Nietzsche sees it, is either made of overt metaphors or of those frozen and effaced tropes he calls concepts. Nietzsche's word for transposition, "Ubertragung," carries in itself the metaphor of carrying over, as does the word "metaphor." Language is nothing but metaphors, hot or cold, overt or effaced, though it is difficult for someone impregnated with the coldness of the system of concepts within which he lives to believe "that even the concept-which is as bony, foursquare, and transposable (versetzbar) as a die-is nevertheless merely the residue of a metaphor" (Eng., p. 85; Ger., p. 315). Nietzsche's task, like Freud's, is to use metaphors of either sort in such a way as to reveal clearly the functioning of metaphors. "On Truth and Lies" is rich and suggestive in its proliferation of overt metaphors, such as the one describing the human condition as like that of a man "hanging in dreams on the back of a tiger" (Eng., p. 80; Ger., p. 311). It is also interest-bearing in its play of conceptual terms, that dicegame of concepts which involves, for example, all those words in "nach" and "uber," to which attention has already been called, or the play among words beginning in "ver" which runs through the essay: Verpflichtung; Verstellung; verwerflich; Verhalten; Vertauschung; verhullend; Vergesslichkeit; verbindlich; Vertragung; verloren; versetzbar; verleugnen, and so on. The examination of one of the best-known of Nietzsche's overt metaphors in this essay will show that he too is entangled in the situation he is attempting to clarify. He can by no effort survey that situation as if 46</page><page sequence="7">from above, in a species of aerial photography of the human predicament. Nietzsche's language is neither purely conceptual nor purely metaphorical, neither scientific nor artistic. It is an example of that perpetual casting of figurative constructions over the mysterious X which the figures attempt to describe. This torsion makes of the essay as a whole an extended example of what I call "the linguistic moment." It attempts the impossible task of defining in unambiguous signs the functioning of signs. Among these signs for the act of signmaking the figure of the effaced coin has often been cited and commented upon:7 What then is truth? A movable host of metaphors, metonymies, and anthropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred (ubertragen), and embellished, and which, after long usage, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and binding (verbindlich). Truths are illusions which we have forgotten (vergessen) are illusions; they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force, coins which have lost (verloren) their image (ihr Bild) and are now considered as metal and no longer as coins. (Eng., p. 84; Ger., p. 314) All three forms of truth-truth of correspondence, truth of internal coherence, and truth of revelation-are implicated in this passage. They are put in question, and then dismantled. The passage, like the essay as a whole, moves among binary oppositions which are substituted metaphorically for one another, but which are in one way or another demolished as clear oppositions in that process of sideways displacement. Here movement is set against stillness, truth against illusion, bareness against the aesthetically enhanced, figurative against conceptual, metaphor against metonymy. What about "anthropomorphisms"? The opposition between the similarities of metaphor and the contiguities of metonymy is undone by the fact that both are anthropomorphisms. Both are products of that power man has to project himself toward the mysterious X or to put himself under it as its illusory foundation. Immanuel Kant calls this power hypotyposis.8 Nietzsche calls it dissimulation (Vertragung), the old rhetoricians, catachresis. Man is the power of anthropomorphic substitution. For no instant can this power be suspended, for man would then no longer be himself. His essence is neither consciousness, nor "spirit," nor "selfhood," but the power of making false transpositions. The metaphor of the coin seems at first pellucid. It is used, like the other metaphors in Nietzsche's essay, as a powerful instrument of demystification. It is used to penetrate through illusions or to wipe them 47</page><page sequence="8">away, as the images stamped on a coin are wiped away by time and use, in order to reveal what is really there underneath, the bare metal of the truth of things as they are. The metaphor, however, like all figures, is not innocent. It is guilty in more ways than one, guilty of a multiple crime. The figure comparing a coin to a metaphor has a long history.9 Money is a good metaphor of metaphor because both are instruments of exchange and of establishing false equivalences. Both in different ways exchange this for that or turn this into that by means of transfers based on conventional or fictional equivalences, and there is much overlapping of rhetorical and economic terminology. If a metaphor is a transfer, property is transferred from this person to that by money, the universal solvent. As Wallace Stevens says, "money is a kind of poetry."'10 What makes a coin valid or distinguishes true coin from counterfeit? This is the question of Nietzsche's essay, the question of verity. There are, it seems, two possible answers to this question. It may be the metal itself which gives the coin its value. The metal may be taken as having an intrinsic worth. It would then function as the measure of all other values. The money of a given country may be on the "gold standard" or on the "silver standard." Even its paper currency is upheld by a claim on its face to be backed by so much bullion. Such money is only a step beyond a barter economy, in the sense that the money, goods, or labor exchanged for one another are presumed to be equal in material value. The other possible validation of a coin is the image stamped on it. Such a coin is valid not because the metal has value in itself, but because it carries the king's image, for example, and behind that is guaranteed by the king's divine right to rule. In such a case paper money is as valid as metal coin. To indulge in coinage is treason, even if the counterfeit coins are of full weight, since what counts is the issuing authority, not the object itself, the substratum which is the bearer of the image of that authority. To make a coin, then, is to coin a metaphor, or the two operations are metaphorically similar, so that there can be a free exchange between them. "To coin good metaphors," said Aristotle in the Poetics, "is the mark of genius" in a poet because it "involves an insight into the resemblances between objects that are superficially unlike."1 1 When one looks more closely at Nietzsche's use of this metaphor, or indeed at the metaphor as used by anyone, it reveals itself to be odd or paradoxical. It is perhaps in some way a counterfeit coin of thought. It leads the mind astray into a false sense of rich implication and shining clarity. The oddness lies in the false ratio the metaphor sets up. Nietzsche's statement begins with a conceptual formula taking the shape of a truthful equation: A is to B as C is to D. Truths, that is, illusions not known to be illusions, are to illusions known to be illusions as conceptual is to metaphorical, as coin mere metal is to coin stamped with an image, as forgetting is to remembering. To remember the metaphors, 48</page><page sequence="9">the poetic transpositon, enhancement, or aesthetic heightening, is like realizing one is face to face with pure blank metal. This is absurdly non-parallel. The failure in parallelism arises from the fact that the image of the removal of the illusory image revealing the bare metal has the form of a figure of unveiling. The bare metal seems to be what is "really there," the substantial truth beneath. Thinking of it this way depends on forgetting that actually the bare metal stands for the false world of concepts, of figures which are no longer recognized as figures. To see the bare metal as the truth one has to forget the forgetting, or to forget once more. Nietzsche's formulation promises a confrontation with the "truth" in some one of its traditional senses. What is missing, in this stammering play of substitutions, is anything which corresponds to the unknown X underlying all the play. The mysterious X is not the bare metal. That is only effaced figure. Nor is it the images on the coin. They are only figures known to be figures. The ratio goes from figure to figure, not from figure to truth. The ratio has a missing term (A is to B as C is to X), as in the examples of catachresis given by Aristotle in the Poetics, 1457b, 26-31 (Butcher, ed. cit., pp. 78-79). This is just the point Nietzsche is making, namely that truth is only another name for illusion, for lie. The metaphor misleads the reader into thinking he can reach the "real" truth by way of Nietzsche's language. The metaphor leads him to believe he can reach the bare truth beneath, the bare coin, by an act of unveiling or the erasure of a forgetting (aletheia) through language. He has been led into error by forgetting that the metaphor of money is a metaphor. It is an image, like the face on a coin, not naked truth. He commits in a moment of inadvertence, of forgetting, the error the passage warns against. It warns against it and yet invites the reader to make it by taking the form of a truth statement. What is truth? The truth is so and so. This error is a version of that sin of the fetishism of money Marx denounces, for example in the Grundrisse or in Volume One of Capital. Such fetishism takes a conventional medium of exchange as a value in itself. The reader of "On Truth and Lies" will commit that sin whether he takes the concepts of Nietzsche's essay or its figures as valid representations of the mysterious X. As the essay tells the reader, even the concepts of the essay are only a disguised form of figure. They are figures which have lost their faces, effaced themselves, as the Stoic philosopher, at the end of the essay, covers himself with his cloak. The Stoic hides his face. He becomes like a coin worn bare, which is appropriate, since the Stoic is pre-eminently the man of concepts. To coin metaphors or to coin metal into money are versions of the same activity, that activity of figuration without which man would not be himself. Either form of coinage brings both artistic language and scientific language, each with its appropriate internal contradictions, into existence at the same time. 49</page><page sequence="10">The internal contradictions cause both the language on concepts and the language of metaphors, as for example Nietzsche uses them in this essay, to turn back on themselves in a reversal which is the most extreme form of what I am calling the linguistic moment. Insofar as the reader takes the metaphor literally and assumes that truth is an effaced coin, he is doing what the image tells him not to do. He is forgetting the aberrant ground of the figure, the way it is a stammering translation of something which remains unknown and unknowable. Insofar as the reader remembers it is a metaphor he remembers that has no truth value and so undoes the claim of the statement to tell him what the truth is, in however negative a fashion. Nietzsche gives an admirably succinct expression of this law of the torsion of truth upon itself in the notes written for a continuation of "On Truth and Lies": "Truth kills-what is more, it kills itself (insofar as it recognizes that its foundation is error)" (Wahrheit t6tet-ja totet sich selbst [insofern sie erkennt, dass ihr Fundament der Irrtum ist] ).12 It should be clear now why the airy labyrinthine fabric man has constructed out of himself for himself is not a safe enclosure. It might seem at first that the building is safe. What does it matter that the unknown X remains unknown, that it remains the atopical in this topography, something without place? Man is safe as long as the labyrinth he has made in law, art, or science remains intact. This permanent displacement does not stay safely in its place, however. It displaces itself everywhere. It per- vades the whole system and makes it unmappable, so that nothing within it remains where it ought to be, in its proper place. Everything moves, wobbles, or stammers, as it does also in any commentary on the system. What, for example, of my use here of English translations? This use is commanded by the conventions of publication in the United States. If the metaphorical transpositions which are the basis of the human world are "properly" to be called stammering translations, what does this mean for a translation into English of Nietzsche's essay? It must be a further translation of what is already a translation. My subjection to an English translation is a dramatic example of the situation the essay describes. The essay is about figurative language, but it also uses figurative language throughout. The critic's ability to interpret it depends on his skill and tact with figures. Figures appear in two ways in the essay, one visible, the other effaced or visible only in a stammering, distorted form, like an inscription half worn away. One form of figure may be more or less successfully translated. This is the overt figure of speech, as when Nietzsche describes the human condition as being like a man hanging in dreams on the back of a tiger. The other form is the presence of "buried" metaphors in all Nietzsche's conceptual terms, as in the words in "uber": "Obertragung," 50</page><page sequence="11">iberspringen," and so on. Sometimes these "buried" figures correspond to those in the equivalent English words and sometimes not, but never exactly. "Translation" and "Obersetzung" are not quite the same figures, though they are similar. Translation in both cases is a form of carrying over, in fact of metaphor or transport, as both words suggest, but with a different nuance. "Setting over" is not quite the same as "carrying over." Reading Nietzsche's essay in English is something like the situation Nietzsche describes in one figure in his essay as typical of man in general, the situation of the deaf man trying to understand sounds from patterns in sand made by resonating sonorities (Eng., p. 82; Ger., p. 312). If translation is always a form of stammering, so in its turn is the work of the critic.13 Literary criticism is translation, but so is the text criticized. The latter is a stuttering transposition of what may not be articulated clearly, namely the atopical unknown X. The text reveals its non-equivalence with its "source" by the fact that it stammers. This stammering can be described as a forgetting. What the text remembers in one place it forgets in another. The situation of the critic is no different. He too is a translator. His materials are the words of a text which is itself a work of translation. It too is made as if by a painter without hands. The materials of the philosopher or poet, whether they are earlier texts or original "intuitions," in either case are transpositions of the unknown. By no process of reverse translation is it possible for the critic to reach back to the original text. The code of the sequence of translations cannot be cracked, only re-encrypted. What is expressed by any stage of that sequence, even the "first," has no existence as a thing to be located at any time or place. It can never be present to consciousness as an object to be given a literal name. It is nowhere at no time. This non-thing or non-presence is neither the transcendental logos nor is it nothing. It is not open to sensation nor to perception. It is the inaccessible center of the labyrinth-neither mind, nor matter, nor distant spirit, nor word. It is wholly silent. At the same time it is already present within any labyrinth man has made as the hostile guest who is found inside the house. It is what ruins art, politics, philosophy, love, poetry. It makes them incoherent, self-dismantling, like the text of Nietzsche's essay. The inaccessible X is both outside Nietzsche's essay as its unnamable ground and also present inside it as what prevents it from being logical or systematic. Nietzsche both knows this and does not know it. He both forgets it and remembers. His essay forgets in one place what it remembers in another. What it untwists in one place it twists up in another, like a knotted loop that cannot be wholly untangled. An example of this is the way the clear opposition at the end of the essay between the Stoic philosopher, protected by his cloak, and the artist, exposed to danger, is undercut by what has been said earlier. The opposition is undercut by the 51</page><page sequence="12">ironic echo of the passage in Aristophanes' The Clouds in which Socrates advises the novice philosopher Strepsiades to cover his head in order to meditate. There may also be an echo of the story in Plato's Theaetetus about the Thracian housemaid who laughed at Thales when he fell down a well while occupied in studying the heavens.14 Even if these echoes are not noticed the reader may remember what Nietzsche has apparently forgotten, namely the way he has described anyone complacently enclosed (verhdl/end) in his illusions as like a man asleep on the back of a tiger. As he says of the seeker after truth, in another part of the essay: "the scientific investigator (der Forscher) builds his hut right next to the tower of science (Wissenchaft) so that he will be able to work on it and to find shelter for himself beneath those bulwarks which presently exist. And he requires shelter, for there are frightful powers (furchtbare Machte) which continuously break in upon him, powers which oppose scientific 'truth' with completely different kinds of 'truths' which bear on their shields the most varied sorts of emblems" (Eng., p. 88; Ger., p. 319). These fearful forces have in fact already entered into the sage's hut, the scientist's tower, and the artist's fabrications. They have entered in the forms of ruinous selfcontradictions within all those forms of protective shielding. For Nietzsche, as for Yeats, it is impossible to bar the foul storm out because its violence has been incorporated into the structures intended to keep it out. However logical man tries to make the hierarchical system of concepts within which he lives, cutting everything neatly, like the sharp corners of a die, numbering everything, and fitting each thing into its proper pigeonhole, like coffins shelved in a Roman columbarium, this cutting and fitting reverses itself. The cutter is cut, as in all those images of grotesque mutilation which run through this essay and which describe man as about to be eaten by a tiger, or as like a deaf musician, or as like a painter without hands. He may be eaten. He has already been dismembered. This dismembering figures his disremembering, his inability to keep a total picture of his condition clearly present in his mind. This dangerous incoherence is repeated by the reader of Nietzsche's essay. An interpretation of it can never be clear or complete. The laws of forgetting and of self-mutilation apply to any reader as well as to the author. Insofar as he thinks he has a clear, distinct, and coherent reading of the essay, he has forgotten some important part of it. He too is taking bare metal as valid coin, or, what is worse, taking bare metal as bare metal, as the naked truth behind illusion. This impotence of both author and reader is the primary evidence of the presence as non-presence, everywhere in the text, of the unknown X which it wrestles, unsuccessfully, to locate and name.

Press, 1947], p. 74). S. H. Butcher translates the same passage simply as "to make good metaphors" (Aristotle's Theory of Poetry and Fine Art [New York: Dover Publications, Inc., 19511, p. 870). Butcher seems nearer to Aristotle, who said: "to gar eu metapherein to to homoion theorein estin." The metaphor of coining is counterfeit coin here, product of the translator's sleight of hand, however much it may be implicit in Aristotle's terminology describing poetry as a making. 53</page><page sequence="14">12 Friedrich Nietzsche, Das Philosophenbuch/Le Livre du philosophe, bilingual ed., French trans.
