<plain_text><page sequence="1">REUBEN A. BROWER Visual and Verbal Translation of Myth: Neptune in Virgil, Rubens, Dryden Although we commonly speak of "the Oedipus myth" or "the Hercules myth," and though anthropologists refer to mythical "archetypes" or "structures," it can be said that there are no myths, only versions. To put it another way, there are only texts for interpretation, whether the text is written or oral, a piece of behavior?a dance or a cockfight?a drawing or painting, a sculptured stone, or a terracotta pot. The principle texts I have chosen for exploration here are two of them verbal, the third a paint ing (with some related examples in other visual media). My primary concerns in exploring each text will be with how the "same" myth?the universalizing "the" seems unavoidable?is transformed when rendered in words or in line and color and what parallels and contrasts can be ob served between these different events in expression. The present essay began in a rather casual encounter between an interest in translation and an interest in paintings of the seventeenth and eighteenth century, particularly of classical subjects. While making some comparisons between Dryden s Aeneid and Virgil's, I happened to remem ber the beautiful picture by Rubens in the Fogg Museum, Quos ego?, or "Neptune Calming the Tempest," which is based presumably on a well known scene in the first book of the Aeneid. From that encounter, and later visions and revisions, comes this venture into the notoriously beguiling study of a "Parallel Betwixt Poetry and Painting." In Virgil's poem, it will be remembered, Neptune rises from the sea to calm the storm in which Aeneas was shipwrecked on his voyage from Troy. Aeolus, king of the winds, acting on Juno's orders, had loosed violent gales from the south, east, and west. Neptune breaks off his denunciation of the winds, "quos ego?," "whom I?," in order to smooth the waves, scatter the clouds, and bring back the sun. He then rides off driving his horses and chariot beneath a cloudless sky. A glance at Rubens' picture ( see figure 1 ) will show that the painting is strikingly like and unlike the narrative. Dryden s translation, though reasonably true to the speech and actions of the original, has revised the myth in ways that can be better understood once we are more familiar with Rubens' painting and the 155</page><page sequence="2">156 REUBEN A. BROWER</page><page sequence="3">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 157 transformation that has taken place there. The painting, which I refer to henceforth as the "sketch," is a beautifully executed modello for a large work, a sketch in no pejorative sense.1 Many questions besides the primary one concerning the transformation of a myth will arise as we explore our various texts. What is the mythical action "like" in each version? What does each version tell us about the mythical thinking or imagination of the author? What does it tell us about the world in which the translation grew? And since all three artists are rendering an event in nature, what is the experience of nature that comes through to us in the Virgilian narrative, the translation, and the picture? Translations, in whatever medium, can be best understood not only in relation to an original text but in light of the "conditions of expression" within which they were created. Dryden's version is in rimed pentameters, because that was held to be the proper measure for heroic poetry. Rubens' sketch has a pictorial rhythm common to many baroque paintings of mythological and religious subjects. Two conditions that affected Dryden and Rubens with almost equal force are the Renaissance and seventeenth century doctrine and practice of "imitation" and the complex of literary and pictorial traditions variously referred to as "heroic" or "historical." The most important sense of imitation for the present study is not the exact copying of classical vocabulary or motifs, but that dynamic process of "assimilation," as Gombrich calls it,2 by which a Renaissance artist re makes in his own terms what he has lovingly learned in active commerce with masterpieces of the past. Though Dryden spoke scornfully of mod ernizing imitation in contrast with translation, he indicates in The Dedica tion of the Aeneis that his aim has been imitation in a sense common to many of his contemporaries: "Yet I may presume to say . . . that taking all the Materials of this divine Author, I have endeavour'd to make Virgil speak such English, as he wou'd himself have spoken, if he had been born in England, and in this present Age."3 Earlier in the same essay he shows that he recognized the close parallel between creative imitation in poetry and in painting: By reading Homer, Virgil was taught to imitate his Invention: That is, to imi tate like him; which is no more, than if a Painter studied Raphael, that he might learn to design after his manner. And thus I might imitate Virgil, if I were capable of writing an Heroick Poem, and yet the Invention be my own: But I shou'd endeavour to avoid a servile Copying.4 We can sharpen our perception of what Dryden and Rubens "saw" in Virgil by considering briefly how the Greek Neptune, Poseidon, was pre sented in Homer and in one or two examples from the Greek arts of a later period. As Cedric Whitman has noted,5 we have no certain illustrations of Homer's text from the Geometric vases more or less contemporary with the Iliad and the Odyssey, though there are paintings of episodes from the Trojan story not included in the Homeric poems. The contrast drawn by</page><page sequence="4">158 REUBEN A. BROWER Whitman between Minoan and Geometric art is most helpful for under standing Homer's representation of his gods, and of Poseidon in particular: For the one, reality lies in the actual appearance; for the other, it lies in action and inner nature, and there can be no question as to which view is nearer to Homer's. Homer almost never describes anyone's actual appearance. His method is strictly dramatic, emphasizing always deed, motive, and consequence.6 To all who are familiar with the vivid images of Greek vase painting and sculpture it may be surprising to discover how little we are made to see the gods of Homer. We have, it is true, impressions of Athena's dazzling brightness and of the shining eyes of Zeus. But though we are told how Poseidon took three giant strides from Samos to Aigai, the point is not the visual image it may suggest to the modern reader, but the action as testi mony of things not seen, of numen, divine power. In general, we see the Homeric gods doing and suffering, not "looking." For if the heroes of the Iliad are "godlike," the gods are like heroes. While Zeus sleeps, Poseidon defends the Danai, leading them to battle with the usual heroic cry, iomen, "let us go forward!" (xiv.374). He comes to the rescue of one warrior, Antilochus; he is angry because of the death of another, Amphi machus, and enters the battle to avenge him: "A god, he strode through mortals' struggle" (xiii.238). We hear in prophecy how he will lead the way "with trident in hand" (xii.27) in destroying the Greek Wall. This is the sole mention of the trident in the Iliad, the phrase implying that Poseidon is using it as an instrument, as he does later in the Odyssey, when angered at Ajax, son of O?leus, "taking the trident in his mighty hands, he struck the rock on Gyrai, and split it off" (iv.506-507). But if the actions and emotions are manlike, the scale is gigantic. Poseidon speaks with the voice of "nine or ten thousand men" (Iliad xiv.135)?though this reminds us of Achilles' colossal shout at the trench. The epithets commonly used of Poseidon similarly imply action on a huge scale: He is gaioxos ennosigaios, one "who encircles the earth and shakes it." He is also kyano chaites, "dark (blue)-haired," an epithet also used of the mane of horses, and perhaps suggesting the color of the sea. (Both connotations are ap propriate since Poseidon is also closely associated with horses.) It is worth noting that he is not grey-haired, no old man of the sea. Zeus is in fact older and more powerful. But though Poseidon acknowledges Zeus's superior strength, he reminds him that they are both equal in honor, and that as the lot gave Hades the underworld, and Zeus the heavens, so his share was the "grey sea." He adds that the earth and "broad Olympus" are common property of all three, thus emphasizing both his Olympian charac ter and his role as earth-god (xv. 190-195). He is the great earth-shaker when he steps down to Aigai, an episode that anticipates in part the scene in Vir gil: He took three long strides forward, and in the fourth came to his goal, Aigai, where his glorious house was built in the waters'</page><page sequence="5">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 159 depth, glittering with gold, imperishable forever. Going there he harnessed under his chariot his bronze-shod horses, flying-footed, with long manes streaming of gold; and he put on clothing of gold about his own body, and took up the golden lash, carefully compacted, and climed up into his chariot and drove it across the waves. And about him the sea beasts came up from their deep places and played in his path, and acknowledged their master, and the sea stood apart before him, rejoicing. The horses winged on delicately, and the bronze axle beneath was not wetted. xiii.20-307 There is visual splendor in these lines, but gold, it should be remem bered, is not merely something beautiful to the eye, but a sign of kingliness and divinity, of the "unperishing." Equally notable is the matter-of-fact character of the narrative. The horses are "bronze-shod," as elsewhere in Homer; the lash is "well-made," and the language of harnessing, mounting, and driving is standard and formulaic; the chariot, diphros, is no different from those used by Homeric warriors. Miracle enters with: [Poseidon] "drove it across the waves" and "the bronze axle beneath was not wetted." But "miracle" as I have used it is a term of the Enlightenment, of a world governed by laws of nature, whereas in Homer the marvelous "occurs as it occurs," and it is recorded in the same tone in which "real" events are re corded. As there is no distinctly physical world, so there is no distinctly spiritual one. The "will of Zeus" is not la sua volontade, but what Zeus quite humanly wants and intends. Magic is present very often in other actions of Poseidon. He takes the form of many persons; he strikes a man with his staff and it fills him, with courage; he bewitches one hero with his eyes and makes the spear stroke of another useless. These and similar actions of many gods are "just the things gods do," and the resultant effects on mortals might well have taken place without divine intervention. To say that a god caused or occasioned the behavior is not to rationalize it away, but to make the com monplace mysteriously wonderful. (As it is: how does a man suddenly become brave? why does the spear miss its mark? ) It may be said that when the Greeks represented their gods definitively in painted and sculpted images, they ran the risk of making the wonderful commonplace. The unnameable god of the Hebrews rightly forbade graven images: he was a spiritual divinity in a sense that Christians and Platonists well understand. It is the human that is glorified in Greek sculpture as in the Homeric poems. None of Homer's gods can compare in heroic dignity with Achilles and Hector. The well-known bronze in Athens (see figure 2), whether of Poseidon8 or of Zeus, is majestic in stance and noble in facial expression. The impression of contained, arrested motion, as often in Greek sculpture, is the "thing"?the effortless ease of the athlete, of a man, not of a divinity in the Judaeo-Christian sense. (A "god" yes, but not God. ) The heroic character of the figure comes out if it is compared with a</page><page sequence="6">160 REUBEN A. BROWER Figure 2. Poseidon/Zeus, ca. 470-350 B.C. National Museum, Athens. Hellenistic counterpart9?in the overripe, sensuous handling of muscles, the melodramatic pose, the turbulent locks of hair, the absence of an implied inner life. We can see what happens when the heroic vagueness of Homer is translated into clearly outlined figures by looking at the Poseidon of the Amphitrite Painter10 in the Boston Museum (figure 3). Here Poseidon is shown as a slender young man in the act of attacking Polybotes, whom he has already wounded. The god, bearded, his long hair crowned with a wreath,</page><page sequence="7">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 161 Figure 3. Poseidon and Polybotes, Attic red-figured Kantharos, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Courtesy of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. seems about to run his trident into the giant's side (as he actually does in another version, in the Louvre).11 Over Poseidon's left arm a "small wrap" falls in elegant motionless folds from beneath a pillowy mass, "the island of Nisyros (which he snapped off with his trident from die island of Cos)," and which he is about to "bring down on his opponent."1* "What man, what god is this?" His glance is alert and amused, and his slight figure-?David to Polybotes' Goliath?looks more like the quick-devising Odysseus than the great god of the Iliad. If Homer's Poseidon were accurately rendered, he would be of Brobdignagian proportions. A more serious version of the same scene, by the Troilus Painter,18 shows the god going after the giant with a more violent if less well-aimed forward thrust. Both these figures, like</page><page sequence="8">162 REUBEN A. BROWER many representations of gods on Greek vases, are barely distinguishable in size or type from the heroes or the young men leaving for wars. Their divin ity is marked principally by their icons, the trident, the club of Hercules, the helmet of Athena, the drinking cup of Dionysos. To jump from these fifth-century forms to Virgil's scene is to have a curious sensation of moving both backward and forward in time?a char acteristic response to a poem that is at once a recall of the Homeric world and a prophesy of Rome's Augustan age. Postponing consideration of this mixture of impulses and motifs, let us concentrate first on picture, on scene and gesture in Virgil's account of how Neptune calmed the storm: Interea magno misceri murmure pontum emissamque hiemem sensit Neptunus et imis 125 stagna refusa vadis, graviter commotus; et alto prospiciens summa placidum caput extulit unda. disiectam Aeneae toto videt aequore classem, fluctibus oppressos Troas caelique ruina. nee latuere doli fratrem Iunonis et irae. 130 Eurum ad se Zephyrumque vocat, dehinc talia fatur: "Tantane vos generis tenuit fiducia vestri? iam caelum terramque meo sine numine, venti, miscere et tantas audetis tollere moles? quos ego?! sed motos praestat componere fluctus 135 post mihi non simili poena commissa luetis. maturate fugam regique haec dicite vestro: non illi imperium pelagi saevumque tridentem, sed mihi sorte datum, tenet ille immania saxa, vestras, Eure, domos; illa se iactet in aula 140 Aeolus et clauso ventorum carcere regnet." Sic ait et dicto citius t?mida aequora pla??t collectasque fugat nubes solemque reducit. Cymoth simul et Triton adnixus acuto detrudunt navis scopulo; lev?t ipse tridenti 145 et vastas aperit syrtis et temp?r?t aequor at que r?tis summas levibus perlabitur undas. ac veluti magno in populo cum saepe coorta est seditio saevitque animis ignobile vulgus; iamque faces et saxa volant, furor arma ministrat; 150 turn, pietate gravem ac meritis si forte virum quem conspexere, silent arrectisque auribus astant; ille r?git dictis ?nimos et pectora mulcet: sic cunctus pelagi cecidit fragor, aequora postquam prospiciens genitor caeloque invectus aperto 155 flectit equos curruque volans dat lora secundo. Aeneid I.124-15614 To read this narrative properly demands, in Henry James's phrase, "a sharper survey of the elements of Appearance" than any similar episode in Homer?Poseidon's journey in the Iliad, or the shipwreck of Odysseus. Vir gil asks us much more often to attend to the seen thing, the picture in words, as in the memorable lines just before this passage :</page><page sequence="9">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 163 apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto, arma virum tabulaeque et Troia gaza per undas. 118-119 Here and there are seen swimmers in the vast gulf, arms of men, and planks, and Troy's wealth on the waves. The first impression in the Neptune narrative is of the sea's confusion, magno misceri murmure pontum, the storm that the god "sees," sensit Next, the waters sucked up from the lowest depths, imis/stagna refusa vadis, the phrase neatly placed between Neptunus and graviter commotus, "mightily stirred," so that we take the participle as describing the sea's "wild commo tion" and the god's anger. (Note here and throughout the importance of descriptive adjectives?aural, visual, emotive.) Then follows the unforget table contrast: the god "looking forth," prospiciens, raises his "calm head," placidum caput, from the sea's surface. "He sees," and we see, "the scat tered, broken fleet," disectam classem. We hear of his "divine power," nw mine, and glimpse again the confusion of earth, sky, and masses of water (133-134). "Sooner done than said," the god "calms the swollen waters," t?mida aequora pla??t: "he chases the clouds away and brings back the sun" ( 143). "The nymph Cymothoe and Triton, working together, adnixus, shove, detrudunt, the ships from the sharp rock, acuto scopuloT In a series of swift action verbs?like Homer's in describing Poseidon's destruction of the wall? the god "himself with his trident lifts the ships, lays open the vast sandbanks, soothes the water, and on light wheels goes gliding over the very top of the waves" (145-147). At the end Neptune is seen guiding horses and chariot with the reins, moving away against a clear sky, caeloque invectus aperto? one final brilliant image of light, reviving by contrast the clouds and "the black night brooding on the sea," ponto nox incub?t atra (89), when the storm struck. The increased emphasis in Virgil on appearance and scene, as compared with similar passages in the Iliad, is proof of an interest in the natural setting for its own sake rare in Greek poetry. Yet if we think of the phrase Wordsworth once used of Virgil in a disparaging contrast with Dryden, "his eye upon his object,"15 we must feel that Virgil had his eye on much more than the event in nature. The storm is being "done up," given scenic value in a kind of mythological drama. It is surprising that so much of the simple anthropomorphism of Homer has survived: down-to-earth human ac tions and feelings?using the trident as a lever to heave up ships, the pas sionate anger of the god. But there is also some loss of the immediately magical and the divinely mysterious, some imminent separation between icon and intended religious significance. The presence of the looming Roman fatum is more felt, as everywhere in the Aeneid, than the imported Olympians. As often happens in translations, a retraction in one area is matched by a gain in another area of experience slighted or vaguely implied in the original. The Neptune of the Aeneid, this scene notwithstanding, is</page><page sequence="10">164 REUBEN A. BROWER much less of a dramatic character than Poseidon in the Iliad. In nearly every episode in which Poseidon appears, he is vigorously carrying out his role as ally of the Greeks in the long drama of the Trojan war, and his will be the final act, when with Apollo he destroys the wall of the Achaeans. The gain in Virgil comes through dynamic assimilation: Virgil turns Poseidon into something new, a literary symbol, which bears a part, as recent critics have shown, in the imaginative order of the whole poem. The order is not Homer's, but the creation of a very different kind of poet, a poet of sym bolic and lyric narration. Before considering how Virgil's form of "proceeding" is reflected in his transformation of the Poseidon myth, let us look briefly at Neptune's speech to the winds and the related simile of the man whose wise words put a stop to an incipient uprising, seditio ( 148-153). Even when Neptune sounds most like the Greek god?as when Poseidon reminds Zeus that the three brothers born of Kronos and Rhea each got an equal share of honor "when the lots were shaken" (xv.190)?the rhetoric, the accent, and the implications are very different. Poseidon's rhetoric is familial, though saved from vulgarity by the formulaic style, but Neptune has been through a course in Roman forensics, and the tone is reminiscent of Cicero to the followers of Catiline ?shrewd, but senatorial. The aposiopesis, "quos ego?," is the master stroke of an accomplished orator: the terrors of the incompleted sentence are more fearsome than anything he might merely say. Instead of a "lot," we hear of imperium ( almost "sphere of influence" ), a term reeking of Roman power and law, of the Augustan world constitution, the peculiar political achieve ment that Virgil's poem is celebrating. In an admirable passage, Victor P?schl reminds us of the surprising force and extension of meaning and o? the links with a larger imaginative design through Virgil's use of a political simile for "the subjection of the storm." In so doing, Virgil was "highlighting a very important sphere of the poem ( namely that of the historical world )." "The connecting symbol becomes an expression of the symbolic relation be tween nature and politics, myth and history, which is at the heart of the Aeneid." In speaking of Virgil, we may refer rightly to an "order of Nature" under divine law, implying a sophisticated notion, an idea, of which there are only faint hints in the poetry of Homer. But we also feel that the Nep tune-Aeolus myth has a new function in Virgil as a poetic symbol for the storm, locally for the actual storm, and in the larger economy of the poem for the "wave breaking against Roman destiny."16 Or, as Brooks Otis points out in his analysis of Aeneid I, "the contrast [in the simile] between the vir pietate gravis ac mentis [the man revered for 'piety' and his services], and the ignobile vulgus [the common herd] armed by furor reveals at a stroke the human meaning of the storm."17 In Otis' view, the storm and its calming becomes an instance of the dominant moral and thematic pattern of the Aeneid, the opposition of pietas and furor, enacted in countless events throughout the poem. A use of myth so easily open to thematic interpreta</page><page sequence="11">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 165 tion comes close to allegory. Though many readers will agree that Virgil does not quite cross the line between the two modes, they may at the same time feel that we are too often distracted, so to speak, from men or gods in action, from drama, to something beyond, to large values and concerns? the history and destiny of Rome, the moral and religious ideal of "piety," the dream of a harmony attainable among personal, political, divine, and nat ural realms of experience. If we now recall Virgil's action-picture and turn to Rubens' sketch ( figure 1 ), what do we see, disregarding for the moment the historical oc casion of this adaptation of the original? What strikes the viewer above all is violent motion?in the waves, the horses, and the wind-tossed clouds? seen against the mellow golden light at the horizon and opening in the dis tant sky. The center and director of this movement is Neptune, who is step ping forward and upward in his chariot-shell, his piercing look following the line of that marvelous gesture of command toward the departing winds and the returning light. The streaming hair and beard, the twisting torso, the whole body "works" with the emotion implied in glance and gesture. The mighty right arm and the trident-thrust ( exactly on the line of the forward bending knee), symbolize, like the outstretched left arm and pointing finger, power and intention?no question here of anything so practical as raising ships or splitting rocks or wounding a giant adversary. Yet the trident is no mere identifying icon or stage prop as in its decorative use by many artists, including Rubens himself on occasion. The grandly serious look, the body's total gesture, are alone sufficient: no further evidence of things seen or un seen is necessary, as in Homer and in Virgil. We are nearer to something like the imagined gesture of Fiat lux. As we should expect, the pictorial element has been much enhanced. The buxom nymphs, in lighter tones of brown and pink, with faint sea-blue touches on the hair, blend below into sea-green waves, as if to blend mythi cal figure and its origin. The winds appear as half-seen faces and forms emerging from cloud-wind streaks, figures and clouds alike done in a range of fused colors from grey and slate blue to brownish and pinkish tones. The chariot-shell?no literal Homeric or Roman war chariot?has produced a kind of wheel with incomplete spokes sprouting "naturally" from the shell whorl. No wheels as in Virgil move lightly over the water: this wheel, such as it is, is involved in the hazy watery motion. The horses are sea horses, hippocampi, legs entangled in panic violence, vivid expressions of the sea's turbulence. These creatures could hardly be driven, nor does this god think of driving, though one nymph pulls?ineffectually?on a "pink bridle."18 Rubens' scene is not least pictorial in over-all composition, in the manner in which violent motion is ordered and contained: the central and echoing diagonal thrusts, of which Jacob Rosenberg speaks so eloquently, the bal ancing of light and dark in human and animal figures, in ship and sail forms, in areas of sea and sky, the posing of definite and less definite out</page><page sequence="12">166 REUBEN A. BROWER lines?color, line, and light so harmonized that all actors, animate and in animate, seem to be caught up in the total natural and supernatural event. How composition works in the two media of picture and poetry is par ticularly significant for defining the different reinterpretations of the Posei don myth. "Words move in time only." In Virgil the action-picture is en meshed in other narrative and nonnarrative contexts of metaphor, theme, and history. The painter has only one instant, at the most the brief time while the eye moves, as in viewing Ruben's sketch, from left to right, up ward and downward within the frame. The shift from poem to painting is all the more striking when the artist has chosen for his moment a speech, an effective piece of rhetoric compared to another piece of rhetoric. What happens, then, in Rubens' translation? No "calm head" rises from the water; Virgil's anticipation of the calm to come is rendered here im mediately in the outstretched hand pointing toward the smoother sea and the brighter light. What was storm and darkness before in Virgil is in the picture storm and coming brightness here and now. Virgil's contrasts are compressed with a much more shocking effect. The overwhelming violence of the horses and waves in the foreground is countered directly above by the lovely arc of sails as the favoring breeze fills them. At one point the compactness of poetry is equaled or surpassed in picture: Virgil's graviter commotus, simultaneously the sea's and the god's disturbance, is rendered in Rubens' sketch by Neptune's figure moving in harmony with waves, horses, clouds, and other deities. "Consider," Burckhardt says of Rubens' rare lapses into theatricality, "how seldom his figures are shown in loud, emo tional speech, how they never rant, how his hands, with all their abundance of beautiful gesture, never gesticulate."1^ In Quos ego?the whole body speaks, language is gesture, drama compressed to the uttermost. And with what result??an increase in the sense of miracle, of spiritual?the word is now inevitable?power. Virgil's speech, noble as it is, makes the god him self proclaim his power, meo numine; and his invective is uncomfortably like scolding, as it is in Homer. To compare the marvelous act to the feat of an orator is to run the risk of bringing miracle down to political reality ( a risk Virgil willingly embraced ). In Rubens we are brought closer to the unexplained wonders of Homer, but with the matter of fact "doings" left out. Hence Rubens' drama and his god are more deeply serious, splendidly and ineffably godlike. The com pression and the immediacy enforce the implication of a purely spiritual power, paradoxically "out of the blood" of this warmly living god. But he is not the dark-haired youthful god of Homer or of the "Landing of Marie de M?dicis,"20 who puts his hand to the great ship, bringing it against the pier. The head of the Quos ego?Neptune, white-haired and bearded, with his intent eye, can scarcely be disassociated from images of God himself. We find much the same head and expression in many religious pictures by Rubens, of God in the coronation of the Virgin and in the Trinity, of saints</page><page sequence="13">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 167 and Old Testament patriarchs (and sometimes of elder pagan deities in distinguishable from saints and holy men of the Judaeo-Christian tradition). The contemporary audience, well-educated in religious art, would have seen and felt this association more instinctively than we do. The ease and frequency with which Rubens transforms pagan figures and motifs into Christian ones, and occasionally, Christian into pagan, has often been noted, most recently in Wolfgang Stechow's Rubens and the Classical Tradition.21 It is commonly assumed that Rubens had seen the Quos ego? of Mar cantonio Raimondi (ca. 1480-1527/37), based on a drawing by Raphael (figure 4).22 A look at the engraving will reenforce what I have been saying about the "spiritual" in Rubens' sketch and show the difference between more or less literal illustration or visual translation and live reworking of a poetic text. ( The splendid quality of the original, the richness and warmth of contrast, and the almost excessive clarity of line are largely lost in the photograph. ) Marcantonio has chosen the exact moment when the god, ris ing from the sea, launches his verbal attack on the winds. His lips are parted in speech, and he pulls hard on the horses' rein. Ships are seen wrecked or sinking, and a slightly earlier event is introduced?Aeneas "stretching his palms to the stars," duplids tendens ad sidera palmas ( 1.93). No one will be tempted to use "spiritual" of this snub-nosed well-muscled strongman. The figure as a whole is less dramatically expressive than Rubens': for example, the right arm thrusting the elegant trident downward (not forward) seems comparatively weak. The hippocampi, with their oddly elongated necks and snouts, comically equine expressions, and inextricably entangled fish-tails, seem to belong to a more prehistoric age than Rubens'. The ail-too human faces of the slightly sullen wind-cherubs may have given Rubens a hint for his beautifully vague cloud beings, but they are curious substitutes for Vir gil's revolutionary "mob" (as Michael Putnam calls them).23 Though well composed, the engraving has little of Rubens' composition in emotional and imaginative depth, or in subtle echoings and blendings of line and color. But, as readers familiar with Rubens' sketch must be saying, the painter had other and more complex intentions than the engraver. The sketch was a model for a huge painting on an architectural stage erected to welcome Ferdinand Cardinal Infante of Spain on his entrance into Antwerp, April 17, 1635. Ferdinand, brother of Philip IV, had journeyed from Barcelona to serve as governor of the Netherlands in succession to Isabella, Rubens' patron and friend. Antwerp had commissioned Rubens to design a series of mag nificent triumphal arches and stages to adorn Ferdinand's progress through the city.24 Though assistants executed most of the paintings, Rubens gave the finishing touches to the large Quos ego?, if he did not do the whole picture (as some accounts suggest). Before the painting (now in Dresden) was turned over to the Cardinal in 1637, Rubens "again repainted" it along with the companion piece on the meeting at Nordlingen between Ferdinand of Spain and Ferdinand of Hungary.25 The event that lay behind sketch and</page><page sequence="14">168 REUBEN A.

Courtesy of the Fogg Art Museum, Harvard University, Gray Collection.</page><page sequence="15">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 169 picture was, according to a contemporary narrative, somewhat less disas trous than the shipwreck of Aeneas. Ferdinand's fleet, having sailed from Barcelona, arrived safely at Caduques (now a semibohemian resort on the Costa Brava). "Apr?s le temps se changea avec des tramontanes et vents contraires" it proved impossible to continue the voyage for "thirteen whole days": Then came the morning when "the sea grew calm, and with the wind [from the south] in the stern, they parted at mid-day, and the weather was so constant and favorable, that on the next morning they began to make out the coast of France."26 At a distance of three years and many miles, this princely contretemps became to the eye of imagination the glorious event of Rubens' sketch, in which Virgil's simile was in effect reversed, the historical reality now being compared to the storm and calm of myth. In Rubens' adaptation of the Virgilian moment, the ships are seen quite unharmed, the dark hued clouds moving through and above them, and the spectral wind face to the far right, Boreas (the wind unfavorable for sailing toward France), is pursued by southern and western winds that fill the sails of the splendid vessels now getting under way. In Virgil, it will be remembered, all the winds are loosed by Aeolus, and Neptune directs his wrath especially against the Southeast and West, Eurus and Zephyrus. We are beginning to see meanings in Rubens' work that would not be apparent apart from three "translations" that his sketch underwent: the large painting by the master and his pupils, the engraving (figure 5) by a colleague, T. van Thulden, and the verbal explanation by Gevart, which ac companied the engraving in the Pompa Introitus . . .

The first shock comes when we see the Dresden version, inferior in nearly every respect to the sketch, though less obvious in its outlines and less abrupt in its transitions than the engraving. Since the commentary is based on the engraving, we may consider a few changes from the sketch, along with Gevart's interpretations. In general, we may say that everything has become terribly definite, with a loss in the effect of a hazy and mysterious mythical natural sea change. The wind-faces have taken on the solidity of Marcan tonio's cherubs, and Boreas is now an aged swimmer with fin-like wings and hands and legs like twisted forms of half-baked pastry, brachiis in pennas desinentibus &amp; serpentinis pedibus, Gevart says. The whorl of the shell blending easily into the wheel has disappeared, and one nymph hangs heavily on a spoke, turning it, Gevart explains, with the help of her sisters. The suggestion of rationalizing in Rubens is crudely exposed: Qua re vortex marinus denotatur, qui in gyrum actus ipsam promouet. NYMPH AS autem quasi LYMPH AS, notum est.28 "(By [their turning of the wheel] is signified the sea's whirlpool, which being driven in a circle, carries it [the shell] for ward. It is well known that we speak of 'Nymphas' as it were for 'Lymphas' [waters].)" In Rubens' sketch all three nymphs are caught up in</page><page sequence="16">170 REUBEN A. BROWER</page><page sequence="17">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 171 the dramatic and visual movement, one looking forward with arm out stretched, the second pointing ahead and glancing back to engage the atten tion of her sister, who is also looking toward the god. In the engraving, the inert turner faces forward, the next nymph turns away, and the third looks coyly out at the viewer. The god's gesture has lost its full effect, since as Jacob Rosenberg notes, his hand comes uncomfortably close to the serpen tine legs of Boreas. (Neptune's hair and beard no longer stream in the wind.) Parts, including the too accurately equipped "triremes," shatter the blended life of the whole. Gevart's commentary brings some interesting support and some surpris ing increments to our earlier reading of the sketch. The inscription on the title page of the Pompa Introitos is a bald adaptation of the Virgilian prophecy, Aeneid VI.851, 853: Tu regere imperio Belgas Germane, memento: Parcere subjectis et depellare superbos. Later in the commentary, the great triumphal arch for Ferdinand29 is com pared with the "Arch of Titus Augustus." In another scene, the temple of Janus is adorned with sculptures of Peace and War, and Gevart offers an ap propriate quotation (VII.601-605) that echoes Jupiter's words in Aeneid 1.291-296, on the closing of the temple and the binding of Furor ( a thematic echo30 of Neptune's action in the storm scene ). In the whirl of quotations from Latin and Greek authors, it is curious that Gevart never cites or refers to the "quos ego?" passage. When describing a Neptune on another stage, Gevart quotes in Greek the Homeric epithets for Poseidon, and comments on them with appreciation of the god's role as earth-shaker. Neptune "bears the trident, since he strikes and lashes the earth with his waves."31 Gevart's interest in historical evidence, hist?rica fide, helps us to appreciate what he and the people of Antwerp saw most vividly in Rubens' scene. An inscrip tion below the engraving begins with Neptuno sternente freturn, "Neptune calming the sea," but most of the five lines are spent in praising the "noble cargo" and the ship that brought it safely over "the Tyrrhenian waters." One suspects that Rubens or his associates reread his sketch in a way to fit this more obvious emphasis, one more to the taste of a seaport town. What then was Rubens doing in the sketch as compared with the en graved version? Something much more complexly organized, and more subtly related to local history, to contemporary and older artistic, literary, and religious traditions. Both versions are very much of their time, but the sketch is more profoundly baroque than the painting in many features we have noted?the focus on the "moment," the strong contrasts and vio lent movement, the diagonal thrust, and above all in the dramatic expres siveness of Neptune's form and gesture. The effect of spontaneity in the whole is characteristic of Rubens' better sketches: "La forme surgit du pin ceau en m?me temps qu' elle na?t avec la pens?e artistique dans l'esprit de</page><page sequence="18">172 REUBEN A. BROWER l'artiste."32 Behind the sketch lies a powerful mythical vision, Virgilian and Homeric and peculiarly Rubensian. If Rubens renews for us the moment of anger in the Aeneid and the change that followed, and if he suppresses some of the humbler actions of the god in both ancient versions, he also re vives the religious mystery of divine action in Homer. He goes still further along the road toward a purely spiritual interpretation of mythical action and toward a more immediate and impressionistic expression of an event in nature, while not forgetting the human actor?a combination that allies him with Homer of the storm similes and the landscape painters of the later eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. There is in Rubens' sketch the oddest blend of precise observation, of rationalizing ( as in the treatment of the chariot-shell ), and of primitive mythical vision ( as in the wind-faces ) : "The wheel survives the myths." But as Svetlana Alpers reminds us in her splendid Introduction to the Torre de la Parada series,33 Rubens' alliances with the past and the future are not easily defined. His treatment of the human body as dramatically expressive is at once in line with contemporary theory and related to prac tices of Helenistic sculptors, whose work Rubens had so closely studied. If like Homer and "unlike Ovid, Rubens commanded a heroic style, which he could inform with a sense of real life without puncturing its ideality,"34 he was also capable of entering into the Ovidian world of irreverence and comedy, as he did in creating the paintings for the Torre de la Parada. Here too he was also working in an earlier tradition, that of the sixteenth-century illustrators of the Metamorphoses*5 Looking through some of the volumes to which Mrs. Alpers refers, we come on plates that may account for some of the departures from Virgil's text in Marcantonio and in Rubens or his colleagues. In La Metamorphose d'Ovide figur?e (1557), a "Fin du d?luge" pictures Neptune in a shell driving two hippocampi. The verses below, based on Metamorphoses 1.324-344, tell how the clouds give way to "Aqui lon, leur ennemi contraire." In "V?nus et Pluton," Pluto comes from the underworld in a shell-like chariot drawn by horses. In the Metamorphoseon Libri XV ( 1582 ), a very animated Neptune rides on a lively and amusing hippocampus36?a version also illustrated by Gevart from ancient coins. This continental Ovidian tradition appears in England in Franz Cleyn's "engravings for Sandys's Ovid [1632], which . . . represent a parallel effort to Rubens' works" for the Torre de la Parada. "They share with Rubens an interest in the mythological narratives as human dramas."37 Cleyn also illustrated the Ogilby translation of Virgil ( 1654),38 a volume well known to Dryden, who spoke scornfully of the translator, though on occasion borrowing from his fairly accurate if inept version. With an eye to costs, Dryden and his publisher took over Cleyn's illustrations for the Virgil of 1697. Dryden's visualization of figures from Graeco-Roman mythology was almost certainly influenced by these Rubensian baroque engravings. Though Cleyn did not illustrate the Quos ego? episode, Ogilby's rationaliz</page><page sequence="19">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 173 ing notes on the passage?of a kind we have encountered in Gevart?are worth noting. Aeolus is referred to as the "king of the Aeolian Islands," who, famed for his ability to foretell "the change of Winds, . . . therefore was thought to have power over" the stormy weather. On the same page we are told that "the physical ground of all, is this: Tempests are begotten by the Clouds, over which luno presides, they being agitated by the Winds, of which Aeolus is Lord."39 The note on Neptune's horses is even more illumi nating: "Turnebus, and others understand here, Hippocampi, Sea-Horses." Ogilby then quotes Statius as evidence that hippocampi have hooves in front but "trail off behind in the form of fish" (postremi solvuntur in aequora pisces).40 While this fits Rubens' steeds, it does not fit Cleyn's illustration for the Neptune scene of Book V (figure 6), where the god assures Venus that the Trojan ships may pass safely on, though "one [Palinurus] must give his life for many" (815). This plate, also used in Dryden's volume, gives a much lighter-hearted impression than the Quos ego? illustrations, in part since Neptune is here shown in a milder mood, soothing the fears of the goddess. His erect figure and gesture domi nate the scene as in Rubens, and he strides forward with dignity and strength (in spite of an awkward twist of the right flank). Neptune is not pointing with his trident, but in the act of launching it (at what?),41 and he is holding the reins of four spirited and capering horses(?), with fin-like forefeet, though without fish tails. He is snub-nosed and crowned, his some what protrusive eye fixed on the goddess above. This Neptune is beneficent looking, and seems to have the beginnings of a smile on his lips, parted per haps in speech. From her bathlike triumphal car, Venus answers with a tender glance and a charmingly deferential gesture. The upper sky opens for her epiphany, as in Virgil, fugiunt vasto aethere nimbi (V.821). The god's shell ( ending in a cheerful dolphin's head ) has the most cunning and convincing wheel-whorl we have yet encountered. It apparently works as a paddle-wheel, something like the vortex in Gervart's note. ( It may be of course that both Rubens' and Cleyn's chariots derive from a common origi nal in illustrations of Ovid. ) The lighter tone of Cleyn's scene is picked up ?perhaps with a glance at Virgil's nereid band (825-826)?in three decora tive mermaids gaily swimming, one with "locks blown forward in the gleam of eyes," another with a comic-book smile of flirtatious satisfaction. Not far off, a male swimmer half-emerges from the waves. One slightly unsettling question before we turn to Dryden: was Rubens' sketch surely based on Virgil's Quos ego?? Not solely, as we have seen, but as the focal mythical image in a complex of historical allusions and many sorts of visual impressions. To strains noted earlier, we may now add one of Ovidian lightness?in the eager nymphs (for Virgil's lone Cymothoe) and in the lusty Triton blowing the way for the sea lord. This is Triton's usual function in both Virgil and Ovid, but not in Aeneid I, where with Cymothoe he is a vigorous helper in freeing ships from the rock. He is very prominent</page><page sequence="20">REUBEN A.

There is also that pink bridle held by the smiling nereid. A glint of Ovidian comedy?of Homeric and Shakespearean "relief"?enters the Renaissance Fiat lux of Rubens. Dryden had access to Rubens' Olympian imagery through other chan nels than Cleyn's engravings, as Jean Hagstrum suggests in his interesting account of baroque pictorial elements in Dryden's odes.42 He could hardly have avoided seeing Rubens' apotheosis of James I on the ceiling of White hall, although "by 1687, humidity had already been fatal to it."43 ( It is ap propriate that James II "authorized a complete restoration.") The passage on Rubens in the supplement to Dryden's translation of Dufresnoy's De arte graphica shows some acquaintance with criticism of Rubens,44 if not surely direct knowledge of the paintings. More to the point is the remark in his own Parallel of Poetry and Painting, cited by Hagstrum, on the close cor respondence between pictorial posture and epic description: "The posture of a poetic figure is . . . the description of [the] heroes in the performance of such or such an action."45 Dryden follows this with a highly pictorial ac count of Aeneas' "posture" before killing Lausus. It should be noted that Dryden had interrupted his Aeneis to do the translation of Dufresnoy, and that these notions of pictorial rendering of heroic gestures were in his mind at the time he was translating Virgil. How does Dryden's Quos ego? appear in the context of the literary and pictorial traditions we have been observing in Rubens and in various writers and artists, ancient and modern? It is still the most readable and energetic version in English: Mean time Imperial Neptune heard the Sound Of raging Billows breaking on the Ground: Displeas'd, and fearing for his Wat'ry Reign, He reard his awful Head above the Main: Serene in Majesty, then rowl'd his Eyes Around the Space of Earth, and Seas, and Skies. He saw the Trojan Fleet disperse, distress'd By stormy Winds and wintry Heavn oppress'd. Full well the God his Sister's envy knew, And what her Aims, and what her Arts pursue: He summon'd Eurus and the western Blast, And first an angry glance on both he cast: Then thus rebulc d; Audacious Winds! from whence This bold Attempt, this Rebel Insolence?

The rhetorical tone, which has a counterpart in Virgil, is louder and more insistent throughout. Other stresses, emotive and visual, also have some basis in the original, but their character can be best understood in re lation to sixteenth- and seventeenth-century pictorial styles. As in Rubens and the engravers, there is much violent movement and feeling, sharply con trasted with their opposites. There is also the continual emphasis on seeing Neptune in various poses and with various looks and implied emotions. "He reared his awful Head" ("awful" is Dryden's addition), yet he is also "Serene in Majesty" (179-180). "The god himself with ready Trident stands" ( 208 ). Attention is directed first to the pose, then to the action. Again, "the Father of the Flood appears . . . and ... his Sovraign Trident rears7?sight and gesture without words are sufficient: "Their Fury falls" (221-223). Neptune is seen "High on his Chariot" (224) (as in all the pictorial ver sions).46 He moves "with loosen'd Reins" (224-225), which is reasonably close to Virgil's text ( note however the descriptive "with" and the participle for an active verb ). But the final picture, "Majestick moves along," is nearer to Rubens: this god is no mere charioteer. One line, "And first an angry glance on both he cast" (187), though not in Virgil, is quite comparable</page><page sequence="23">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 177 to the strong look of Rubens' Neptune. The line and a half added by Dry den, "then rowl'd his/Eyes Around the Space of Earth, and Seas, and Skies" ( 180-181 ) suggests something of the scale of Rubens' scene; but the "rowl ing" eyes are baroque with a vengeance, more grotesque than those of Cleyn's engraving. Other pictorial elements not in Virgil are added: "and the Sea-green Train/Of beauteous Nymphs, the Daughters of the Main" (205-206)?which has the effect of dimming the precise if "low" acts that follow. Dryden does mention the "Chariot," but like the painters he brushes over the awkward business of a chariot race on the water. The wheels are not mentioned, and the "finny Coursers" recall the pictorial style and the rationalizing tendency of the seventeenth-century versions and their com mentators. Stock poetic diction?note also "Wat'ry Reign" and "the liquid Plains"?elevated and vaguely visual, is the verbal equivalent of the heroic descriptive style in painting. The writer makes a gesture toward picture, without giving much evidence of having seen anything in particular. What probably most strikes twentieth-century readers of Dryden's lines is the heightening of the imperial and the political themes, although there are analogies in the arbitrary gesture of Rubens' god and in his many refer ences to the historical occasion, more blatant in the painting than in the sketch. As often, Dryden adopts a note in Virgil, heightens it, and loads it with local applications. The underlining of the imperial and royal character of Neptune appears from beginning to end of the passage: "Imperial Nep tune," "Wat'ry Reign" and "obedience to my Reign, "Majesty" and "Majes tick," "my supream Command," "your Lord," "my Royal Mandate," "sovraign." Finally, the god is the ruler who "awful Peace maintains"?lan guage that might suit the Supreme Deity of the next century. In the grand generalizing force of this phrase and in the insistent "mys" emphasiz ing the royal prerogative, Dryden reflects Charles II's seriocomic obsession with the image of an absolute monarch, ruling by divine right.47 The scorn ful references to "th' ignoble Crowd" are more vulgar than Virgil's, and we hear the Tories' fear and mockery of "Rebel Insolence" and "Rustick Arms." The dignity and wisdom of Virgil's "grave and Pious Man," though the translation is literal to a fault, is brought by the context down to English political realities. To define the parallels and the differences between Dry den and Rubens in this area would require a separate monograph. "The subtle adaptation of the mythological scene" in Rubens, says Rosenberg, "to the actual life of the prince shows how earnestly the Baroque humanists and artists undertook to prove the Divine support of the sovereigns."48 Rubens is doing more than this, as we have seen, in the commanding presence of a Godlike figure who reminds us of a spiritual order perceptible in Nature and superior to kings, though the allusion confers honor on them. In Dry den's version, as in his royal odes, the strain of the royal-divine rhetoric is all too evident, as it is for some viewers (though not for the writer) in the Marie de M?dicis cycle, where myth happily eclipses history.</page><page sequence="24">178 REUBEN A. BROWER What finally can we say about Dryden's translation of myth in relation to Virgil, Rubens, and the other texts, verbal or visual, that we have sur veyed? We can hardly suppose or expect that Dryden's mythological event will reveal the complex poetic, historical, and moral ordering of Virgil's poem. That cannot be if Virgil is to "speak such English, as he would him self have spoken, if he had been born in England, and in the present Age." Resonances are lost on which larger connections depend : "pious" is not pius and "Fury" is not furor. But it should be said that in spite of these inevitable losses, Dryden's Aeneid as a whole carries over much of Virgil's sense of history and "destiny." The political and rhetorical accent of Dryden's lines, which has some justification in Virgil, unfortunately also inclines his version toward the values and mores of the rising Tory party in the reigns of Charles II and his brother. That Dryden attempted to picture the action again starts from a Virgilian quality, though the style of his verbal "painting" derives from the baroque manner of Cleyn and more generally from the Rubens tradition as it reached not the most visual of English poets. Although the "postures" of Dryden's Neptune remind us of Rubens' god, they also remind us that Dryden did not take either his visual apparatus or the divine ma chinery very seriously. The tendency to emphasize the pose, not the act or the numen, to rationalize miracle by omission or soften it by veiled poetic diction, will find a point of arrival in the picturesque gods and goddesses of decorative painters and landscapers of the eighteenth century in Italy and in England. Pope, who looked on Nature with more reverence and with a keener eye as painter and mythmaker, and who loved mythological allu sions in landscape and garden, also saw their possible triviality and abuse: Here Amphitrite sails thro' myrtle bowers; There Gladiators fight, or die, in flowers; Un-waterd see the drooping sea-horse mourn, And swallows roost in Nilus' dusty Urn. But if Ovidian irreverence, which anticipated the death of the gods, had its effect on the tradition that touched Dryden in the Cleyn engravings, if it also affected Rubens even in the noble mood of the Quos ego?, it did not prevent him from embracing other mythical modes and ways of seeing, even contradictory in impulse. He, too, quietly omits the more humble op erations of Homer's Poseidon and Virgil's Neptune, and he subdues the liter alism of "wind-men and -women," and of war chariots at sea and their hu man drivers. How Virgil regarded Neptune's "shovings" and "liftings" we cannot know, though at least one critic sees a "rough humor" in this and similar narratives in the Aeneid. What is most remarkable about Rubens is that he harmonizes both the deeper Virgilian and the Homeric visions. His Quos ego? bears a weight?perhaps too great a one?of historical and ideological reference: the heavens themselves, God and Nature, further the purposes of the king of Spain and his emissary. But if we return to the visual "thing," we see that without literalism, Rubens renews the Homeric vision</page><page sequence="25">TRANSLATION OF MYTH 179 of human figures and gestures dramatically expressing events both natural and supernatural.49 In the way in which rushing lines, subtle harmonies of color and light, work to give a sense of how Powers are "begotten" from our sensations of the physical world, he takes us beyond Homer to where all myths begin: One's grand flights, one's Sunday baths, One's tootings at the weddings of the soul Occur as they occur. So bluish clouds Occurred above the empty house and the leaves Of the rhododendrons rattled their gold, As if someone lived there. Such floods of white Came bursting from the clouds. So the wind Threw its contorted strength around the sky. Could you have said the bluejay suddenly Would swoop to earth? It is a wheel, the rays Around the sun. The wheel survives the myths. ?Wallace Stevens, "The Sense of the Sleight-of-hand Man"50 References 1. Leo van Puyvelde, Les esquisses de Rubens (B?le: Les Editions Holbein, 1940), p. 57.

John Pinto has suggested a possible connection with Bernini's "Neptune and Triton," ca. 1620, where Neptune thrusts his trident downward, with great vigor, apparently toward the water of the fountain in which it was originally placed. See Howard Hibbard, Bernini (Baltimore: Penguin Books, 1965), pp. 39-43. Note, in relation to Cleyn's shell, "the trailing cloak that suddenly becomes a dolphin," p. 40. Cleyn's triton bears some resemblance to the rear view of the triton in Bernini's group, and possibly to the triton of the Piazza Barberini. 42.
