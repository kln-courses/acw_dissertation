<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CULTURAL POETICS OF EYESIGHT IN SRI LANKA: COM? POSURE, VULNERABILITY, AND THE SINHALlA CONCEPT OF DISTIYA David Scott It has recently been said of Western modernity that it is the most ocular of ages. And to be sure, in a variety of ways one could show the evidence of this, of "vision as the master sense of the mod? ern era."1 In philosophical discourse, for instance, Richard Rorty has convincingly shown how the ocular metaphor (the mind as an eye inspecting what is pre? sented to, and "mirrored" in it) has been central to the Western metaphysical tra? dition, particularly since Descartes.2 Or again: In the formation of social prac? tices, Michel Foucault has demonstrated how, in the birth of modern clinical medi? cine and of the modern prison, power could be made to inhabit a register of vi? sion.3 In such instances Western dis? course has projected an image of a sovereign subject of vision where "vision" is constituted as the privileged pathway to Knowledge.4 And of course, from the other side as it were, that of the object of vision, the work of Sartre and Lacan have provided variations on the theme of the subjectifying force of the gaze of the Other.5 Western modernity, however, wheth? er Christian or secular, has no cultural monopoly on this allusive figure of vi? sion. In Buddhism too, "vision" is a pro? ductive metaphor. Thus, for example, Buddhists draw a distinction between two kinds of "views," samma ditthi (cor? rect views or true knowledge) and micca ditthi (wrong views or heresy). And ac? ceding to the former, samma ditthi con? stitutes the first step along the Middle Path to nirvana.* So that the subject of il? luminating vision is in fact a normative figure in Buddhist discourse. Moreover, at least in some Buddhist traditions, the figure of the object of vision (or as I shall prefer, of eyesight) is no less important. Among Sinhala Buddhists of the south? western coast of Sri Lanka, for example, there is a pantheon of malign super? natural figures called yakku, who, by casting their glances upon Sinhalas, af? flict them with one or another misfortune or illness (called yaksa dosa). And there is a whole art (collectively called guru kama, lit., "the work of the teacher") con? cerned with^the control and influence of these yakku and their malign eyesight, arts of which the practice of the ceremony called yaktovil is the most elaborate. Curiously enough, however, the mod? ern anthropology of these practices, now a rich store of varied description and analysis, has paid little or no attention to this factor of eyesight.7 If what has occa? sioned this neglect is not readily discern? ible, I think it must nevertheless be al? lowed that since (as is surely the case with the construction of any discursive object) the field of an anthropological concern, that is to say what gets counted as the important constituents of its dis? cursive practice, is determined by the kind of problematic employed (and not the other way around), this neglect can David Scott teaches Anthropology at Bates Col? lege, Maine Dialectical Anthropology, 16: 85-102,1991. ? 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.</page><page sequence="2">86 not be fortuitous. And at least one aspect of it, it seems to me, has to do with the fact that this body of work has been much preoccupied with the Christian metaphor of "possession." The little questioned assumption that there are "demons" in Sri Lanka that "possess" Sinhalas and that are, in special "demon ceremonies," "exorcised," has tended both to construct a misleading image of Sinhala cultural practice, and to obscure the specific local conceptions of the way in which the malevolent influence of yakku is effected.8 And as a result (as one result anyway) the Sinhala concept, distiya, that concept that organizes the general conception of the distinctive malevolent effects of yakku, has found no place in anthropological description of Sinhala cultural practices. My aim in this essay is a deliberately preliminary one. I propose neither an analysis, nor even a description, of any of the practices of gurukama, that range of varied practices by means of which the malign effects of yakku are removed.9 Ra? ther, what I propose is to sketch out something of the conception of eyesight thatjnforms the Sinhala discourse of yakku generally, and to try to show its relation to the fashioning of certain dis? tinctive dispositions of the Sinhala body and self. My plan is as follows: First, I will introduce the Sinhala poetics of eyesight by trying to convey something of what "eyesight" entails for Sinhalas. Sec? ond, I will outline the relation between that specific form of malevolent eyesight known as distiya and specific modes of being of the Sinhala body. This body I will be concerned to show is not a body that is available for "possession" in the classical Christian sense which anthro? pology has so often assumed. And third, I will attempt to show the importance to Sinhala self-fashioning (a term I borrow from Stephen Greenblatt10) of composure, that is, of the regulated equanimity of the self and body, and to show, moreover, how this composure is vulnerable to a disruption defined precisely in terms of eyesight. Finally, it will be my general thesis that it is only by understanding this relation between eyesight and the distinctive dispositions of the Sinhala self and body that we can begin to ade? quately appreciate the Sinhala practices involved in influencing yakku, and the practice of yaktovil in particular. A CULTURAL POETICS OF EYESIGHT Let me begin with a story about a particular local deity of the Sinhalas whose eyesight is legendary. It was told to me on more than one occasion by some of the more elderly residents of Devinuwara (literally, "city of the god"), the southernmost town in Sri Lanka.11 It is a story that embodies, I think, what we might usefully call a Sinhala poetics of eyesight, a distinctive discursive or narrative practice, through which parti? cular aspects of Sinhala cultural life are constructed and fashioned. If cultural discourses and practices are marked by the idiom in which they are enfolded and lived, certain local discourses and prac? tices of the Sinhalas are, I want to sug? gest, set off by a distinctive troping of eyesight, that is to say, a distinctive cultural poetics of eyesight. Here is the story: In Devinuwara, the King of the Southern Kingdom of Ruhunu, Dapulusen, once of? fered a reward to any man who could carve, out of the red sandalwood he would make specially available for the purpose, an image of the deity of the town, Upuluvanna. Many tried, and as many failed. In time however there appeared a man of humble bearing who made known his desire to try as others had done. He shut himself in the room with the sandalwood and there remained for days</page><page sequence="3">87 on end. At length the King himself, growing curious and impatient, went to inquire as to the progress. He opened the door, and there before him stood a nine-foot sandalwood im? age of Upuluvanna. The man, however, was nowhere to be seen. Nor was there any evi? dence, in the way of wood shavings say, of the sandalwood having actually been worked. All who saw were astonished. The image was then taken to the top of a small hill [the site it is said of the original devala or shrine-house of this deity12], and there installed such that it looked directly over the southernmost tip of the island. In time the Portuguese came and con? quered the maritime areas of Lanka.13 They came to Devinuwara. But try as they might, they could not sail across the line of the deity's eyesight. Enraged, they committed an atrocity upon the image, cutting the legs so that the sight of the deity now fell upon the ground. The deity was thus rendered power? less to stop their rampage. Or so the Portuguese thought. Eventually, in retreat from their colonial successors, the Dutch, the Portuguese ransacked the ancient town of Devinuwara. They loaded their ships with the loot. And of course, they loaded the red sandalwood im? age of Upuluvanna whose eyesight had so impeded their marauding designs. But taking flight, their ships sank. And the sandalwood image of Upuluvanna floated around the western coast of Lanka, beaching itself at the town of Chilaw. From there it was taken to the great Rock Temple at Dam bulla in the central highlands. And even today it can still be seen there.14 For Sinhalas then, the eyesight of their supernatural figures is invested with a distinctive facility: an energy, an uncanny force. Upuluvanna's unblinking sight, stretching out over the ocean, formed a steadfast, transparent wall?a sort of beam of eye-energy, so to say?preventing the trespass of the colonial invaders. Now one of the things that is particularly interesting about the economy of this narrative is the implicit attribution of knowledge it involves. The narrative, we notice, attributes to the Portuguese themselves the knowledge that the source of their obstruction is to be found in the eyesight of the image of the deity. It is not, for instance, a native who is made to divulge to them this criti? cal piece of local knowledge. Rather, that it is eyesight that constitutes the ob? stacle is something which it treats as self-evident. So that, in effect, it func? tions narratively as an ingenious self confirmation to Sinhalas of the fact that, in the scheme of things, it is eyesight that constitutes the zone of singular potency, energy, and force. But notice something else too, namely, the distinc? tive modality of this obstacle of eyesight. It is not that the Portuguese are, let us say, seen by Upuluvanna while trying to secret their way into Lanka, and tnat their malign presence is then made known by the pool of light surrounding, and thus detecting, them. Eyesight here, in other words, is not linked to a dark? ness that is made light, to something hidden that must be made known, and therefore eyesight for Sinhalas, as we shall see, is not connected to the moral selves that necessarily accompany this revelatory conception and practice of eyesight. Rather the eyesight of the deity has the hard consistency of a beam and the animated intensity of an energy that forms a physically impassable barrier. It is this constitutive and expressive visuality of cultural practices, their au? thoritative figuring in a register of eyesight, that constitutes what I am call? ing a cultural poetics. The troping of eyesight therefore, not unlike the troping of sex and sexuality elsewhere, can form a distinct element in the framing and production of cultural discourses and practices, and in the fashioning of the distinctive moral subjectivities impli? cated in them. Eyesight, like any other</page><page sequence="4">88 human potentiality, can be marked off as a distinctive zone, made to stand as the epicenter of a whole battery of radiating discourses, invested with special and unique qualities, surrounded by sanc? tions ana restrictions and dangers, and associated with distinctive mental and physical dispositions and aptitudes. In an interesting article on visual in? teraction in Hindu practices in India, Lawrence A. Babb15 discusses just this kind of cultural troping of a visual regis? ter. Babb's description is useful since not only is it one of the few attempts to in? quire into the constitutive and expressive visuality of a non-Western cultural prac? tice,16 but it also converges at several points with aspects the Sinhala cultural poetics I will be discussing in the re? mainder of my paper. Hindu devotees, Babb maintains, want both to see their deities and to be seen by them. The eyes in Hindu practice are central to the interaction between worshipper and deity. They are central because they are associated with the "life" of the deity. The presence of the deity (or of its image) is almost synony? mous with its facility and power of sight. Moreover, in Hindu practice the sight of a deity has a moral register; it can have benevolent or malevolent effects on what is seen. The deity's glance, that is to say, can either be one of "compassion" or one of "anger." And at least one object of Hindu worship is to attract the benevolent gaze (darsan) of the deity. Underlying this belief,' Babb suggests, is a particular conception of "seeing^ which he describes as an "extrusive flow-of seeing that brings seer and seen into ac? tual contact."17 Or, as he puts it later, The point is that in the Hindu world, "see? ing'' seems to be an outward-reaching pro? cess that in some sense actually engages (in a flow-like way ...) the objects seen. There fore glances can affect the objects at which they are directed, and bad glances can have harmful effects.18 As the story of Upuluvanna suggests, among Sinhala Buddhists in Sri Lanka one finds a similarly distinctive practice of visual interaction. In the Sinhala sense "sight" is not a mere passive registration of external objects in the physical or reflecting eye of the inert seer?as if the "eye" were simply an organ-receptacle catching the refracted lignt off the objects passing within its field. Nor, on the other hand, is sight the simple inverse of this in which the "inner" or "psychological" eye construc? tively perceives and thereby establishes, so to put it, its field of vision. One might say that for Sinhalas the visual meta? phor is not caught up in a problematic of "representation" where what is at stake is the "registration" or "reflection" of an image.19 These latter metaphors belong perhaps to another cultural poetics else? where, and organize a different relation between sight, knowledge, and physical and mental dispositions than that found among Sinhalas. As with the Hindu practices Babb describes, the image of "sight" and "see? ing" in Sinhala cultural poetics is rather that of an internally generated activity, a mobile energy, a continuous flow, preci? pitated outwards, as it were, from the seer to objects. And these objects it should be understood are not merely brought within the field of the seer's gaze, illuminated (in either the active or contemplative sense) as though to be read, but literally brought into contact with the force of its energy. Among Sin? halas (as will become clear with my dis? cussion of distiya), sight is something that can actually, deliberately, be "put" (l?nava) on, or, more vividly, "cast" (halanava) upon, an object by the seer so</page><page sequence="5">89 as to be able to "touch" (vadinava) it. Sight in other words can be placed and, similarly, displaced, but this placement does not imply thereby a detachment or interruption of its flow of energy. This is important to bear in mind. You will recall that Upuluvanna's eyesight was not cut off (he was not, for example, blinded by the Portuguese); rather it was "deflected," maga harinava, a most sig? nificant Sinhala notion. At the same time there is a more im? portant aspect than mere "extrusivity" to oe emphasized, or rather, an aspect which extrusivity itself highlights. And that is that for Sinhalas "being seen" is a thoroughly ethical condition. Thus it is not altogether surprising that this gener? ative sight or look (b?lma, as Sinhalas say), extruding from some ethically con? stituted agency and coming into contact with an object (also ethically con? stituted), is able to effect changes? changes of ill or good?in it. Eyesight for Sinhalas therefore organizes at once a distinctive "rationality' of practices and a distinctive "ethics" of the self and body. To be seen occupies an expressly moral and therefore normalizing register. By this I mean that for Sinhalas being seen is involved in the organization of specific culturally defined dangers and of the strategies to control, restrict, avert or reverse those dangers. And therefore the figure of eyesight participates in the techniques by which power disciplines and subjectifies. It is involved in the or? ganization of specific forms and practices of subjectivity, specific mental and physi? cal dispositions, vulnerabilities, propen? sities, and aptitudes relevant to those dangers, to their identification, their regulation, and their management. All figures in Sinhala Buddhist cos? mology?malevolent and benevolent su? pernatural, the Buddha, and humans? are attributed at least a potential power or force in the register of eyesight.20 My particular concern in this paper, how? ever, is with an especially dreaded aspect of this eye-energy?that having to do with the eyesight of those malevolent Sinhala figures called yakku. YAKKU AND THE CONCEPT OF DISTIYA Another story: Yakku: (sing., yak?, or yaksaya21), according to a Sinhala legend, were the original inhabitants of Lanka. They were a cannibalistic species, given up to lives of lawless extravagance, to song and dance and food. Merriment and devastation were their chief pastimes un? til the Buddha, grieved by what he saw, and appealed to by the gods, intervened and yakku were exiled to the fabled is? land of Yak Giri (Yak Giri diva22). But the Buddha, in so ridding Lanka at last of these dreadful creatures, worked a curious compromise. For as part of the vivaranaya, or sanction, by which these yakku were bound, he gave them leave to make people ill on the sole condition that they then accepted the offerings made to them in his name by the authorized per? sons, yakaduras, and removed their malign influence. This, so to speak, was their dispensation. It allowed a curtailed and much restricted margin for their malevolence. But importantly too, most importantly in fact, by the Buddha's ac? tion their mode of malevolent activity was also circumscribed; indeed it was quite radically transformed. In their long, immemorial reign in Lanka, yakku had been accustomed to sating their craving for flesh and blood by seizing and eating human beings with impunity. The Buddha's intervention however put an end to this lawless liberty. He djew, as legend has it, an im? penetrable simava, or boundary, around Lanka, preventing thereby the physical re-entry of these yakku. But in order, as it were, to partially accommodate their</page><page sequence="6">90 malevolent designs, or at least to contain them within a designated field of action, the ever magnanimous Buddha permit? ted them a distinctive and singular modus operandi. Yakk? were allowed only to cast their glances or "look" (b?lma) upon Lanka and its inhabitants, to look at (or upon) them, as "through the eye of a needle." Moreover, this "looking" itself was confined to short periods at various times of the day. And it is this "looking" which, from that inaugural day to this, has constituted the register of the malign power of yakku. Such then for Sinhalas (or at least Sinhalas of the Matara area of South? west Sri Lanka) is the origin ofthe male? volence of the eyesight of yakku. Now in talking about yakku and their eyesight, people most often use the term distiya. Indeed, easily the most vital concept in? volved in the whole Sinhala discourse of yakku and practice of yaktovil is the con? cept of distiya. Distiya refers to the malign energy or essence of the eyesight of yakku.23 And indeed it is possible to say that distiya, this malign energy of eyesight, is almost synonymous with the very presence of yakku themselves. If in the modern anthropology of the Sinhala yaktovil the concept of distiya has suffered a curious neglect,24 it is "in? teresting that it did not escape the atten? tion of that nineteenth century Sri Lan? kan maverick, Dandris de Silva Goone ratne. In what is undoubtedly still the most fascinating work on the Sinhala discourse of yakku, his seminal mono? graph-sized essay, "On Demonology and Witchcraft in Ceylon" (1866),25 Gooneratne offers the following remarks: Although demons are said to shew them? selves in these ways to men [i.e., in various apparitions], yet the opinion of those, who may be called the more orthodox of the demon-worshippers, is that these appari? tions are not the demons themselves, but certain puppet-like spectres, which they create and present to the eyes of men, in or? der to frighten them; that the demons them? selves are millions of miles distant from the earth; and that on these occasions of sending forth these spectres, and on every other occa? sion, whether during demon ceremonies, or at any other time when they are supposed to be present, they do not come themselves, but send their dristia, with or without the spec? tres, according to the circumstances of each case, or merely according to their own whim. By dristia, which means literally "sight," or "look," is meant that, although they are not personally present, yet they have the power of "looking* at what is going on below, and of doing and attending to every thing required of them, as if they were actually present. This opinion, however, is one which is con? fined to the more learned of the demon wor? shippers; the more ignorant believe that the demons themselves are bodily present at these scenes, although they assume some sort of disguise, whenever they choose to make themselves visible to men.26 This compact yet penetrating passage seems to me to serve well as an introduc? tion to the Sinhala concept of distiya. _ The malevolent eyesight of yakku constitutes a specific kind of danger to avoid upon which a whole rationality is constructed, and a number of strategies employed. The Sinhala day, for instance, is meticulously divided into watches or jamayas when it is likely that one will meet with the malign eyesight of yakku. Similarly, there are certain places to which it is expressly inadvisable to go out alone, especially at certain hours? wells at mid-day for example, cemeteries at night, etc.?because these are favorite haunts of yakku. Again, there are certain foods which it is inadvisable to eat on certain occasions (e.g., fried foods) unless one follows such a repast with specific practices (e.g., drinking water). Thus there is a whole repertoire of practices to avertthe danger posed by the eyesight of yakku.27</page><page sequence="7">91 DISTIYA AND THE VULNERA? BILITY OF THE SINHALA BODY Let me turn now to a discussion of the relation between this malign eye energy, distiya, and the Sinhala body. In anthropological discussions of cultural practice the body has only recently be? come a field of deliberation. This focus, however, welcome as it is, has often remained relativist and ahistorical in tendency.28 In a recent volume on the "anthropology of the body" for instance, the editor, John Blacking,29 argues a con? cern for discovering and describing what he calls "the latent repertoire of the hu? man body from which cultural trans? formations are ultimately derived."30 This anthropologizing endeavor, how? ever, even in its explicit effort to avoid the nature/culture paradigm, only reproduces its generative problematic in the assumption that cultural practices are "externalizations and extensions of the body in varying contexts of social in? teraction."31 The view which Blacking ad? vances has as its grounding assumption the idea of a fundamental material sub? strate, a "real," unchanging body, which comes before, and so to say substantial? izes, its varied cultural representations. In such a conceptualization the kind of question to be put to Sinhala material is familiar enough: given the human body [such is typical form it takes], how do Sinhalas imagine or represent (or in? deed "experience") the action and effects of the malign eyesight of yakk?? This is a question, I wish to argue, which, in ef? fect, only repeats the whole archive of the science/ideology (and biology/culture) problematic according to which an al egedly universal body enveloped in ideo? logical or cultural representations is sup? posed nevertheless to be accessible to science for confirmation or correction. However, as Marcel Mauss' seminal 1934 lecture on "Techniques of the Body"32 first brought to our attention (and as has subsequently been shown not only by Michel Foucault, but in particu? lar by a number of feminist critics33), there is no such universally invariable body but rather several historically and culturally specific bodies. The pre Socratic body for which divinity and cor? poreality were not radically dissociated, for instance, was not the same as the body of the Gnostics of late Antiquity, for whom it was a "prison" in which the divine principle or Soul was kept captive. Or again, the Daoist body that in its or? ganization replicates the Universe is not the body of the modern American physi? cian with its internal physical geography of pulsating organs. Bodies, that is to say, are given to modalities, gestures, ap? titudes, that are subject to the variable strategies and structures of their forms of life. And these strategies and struc? tures have to do with the several locally concrete and pragmatic ways in which bodies are disciplined, exercised, and employed, and in which, consequently, they come to be taken as the distinctive kinds of bodies they are and lived capacities, potentialities, and vulnera? bilities. The point here is that these capacities and vulnerabilities themselves constitute a density and not a mere sym? bolic transparency. In short, bodies may be said to be subject to a variation which is not that of their ideologies or symbol izations, but that of their living and use.34 In a conception of the body so recast, it seems to me, it becomes possible to ask an entirely different sort of question of Sinhala cultural practice. And this ques? tion may be posed as follows: In light of the characteristic power attributed to the malign nature of the eyesight of certain supernatural figures, what kind of body must the Sinnalas endow themselves with, what kind of body must they ac? quire in their cultural practices relating to these figures'? For again, bodies in this through their attributed &gt;sed</page><page sequence="8">92 turn of conception are the effect of the cultural practices that produce them, not their immutable and enduring substrate. The Sinhalas, I shall attempt to show, construct a distinctive kind of body, a body vulnerable in specific ways to malign eyesight. This way of posing the question of the relation between cultural practices and bodies (that is, in Mauss' suggestive phrase, the question of the body's embed dedness in a cultural habitus) is of parti? cular interest in the Sinhala context of distiya and its effects. For, as I have al? ready suggested, in those Western dis? courses which have described the Sin? hala yaktovil and related practices, the effects of distiya have been unreflexively read through a general thematics of "possession.' Indeed the whole Sinhala discourse of yakku and practice of yak? tovil has been unproblematically con? structed through the metaphor of "exorcism." Nur Yalman for example maintains that the bali ritual (the prac? tice in which the malign effects of in? auspicious planetary arrangements are removed) "is intended ... to get the yak kuva out of the patient's body."35 Similarly, John Halverson, talking about a "patient" being interrogated by an "exorcist" refers to the "demon in him" and to his "incubus";36; and further on states that "though the demon may not be of him, it is unequivocally in him."37 And there is Bruce Kapferer's conception of a "demonic self that "emerges" to dominance in certain sequences of "exorcism."38 Now of course it might be argued in response that these statements are but marginal to the complex arguments of? fered in their respective texts. However one needs no proficiency in that practice (of reading the "margins") associated with the name of Jacques Derrida to recognize that this Christian metaphor, "possession" (which depends on the im? age of an anthropomorphic presence entering the body, occupying its interior, and gaining thereby control over the will or soul that already inhabits it), has con? ditioned the kinds of themes and prob? lems produced in analyses of yaktovil.39 Moreover, and this is the more central point, without an analysis of the specific Sinhala categories through which a dis? tinctive practice of the body is connected to a distinctive conception of eyesight, it is not clear to me how one can make such assumptions about ''possession."40 To be sure, as I will try to show in my own dis? cussion, the relation between malign eyesight and the body forms an intricate web, and tracing out all the connections is beyond the scope of this paper. How? ever, at the least, these characterizations indicate that a whole area of Sinhala cultural poetics is left to be in? vestigated?that area in which the Sin? hala body is organized (in the sense of constituted as an organism) as the condi? tion for a variable subject potentially subject to malevolent eyesight.41 In colloquial Sinhala there are a va? riety of ways of referring to the malign disposition of distiya in relation to the body of the afflicted person. I want now to discuss these in relation to the ques? tion of "possession." I shall that argue unless this metaphor is divested of its distinctive Western/Christian connota? tions, it is misleading to apply it to the Sinhala body. In the first place, the action that con? stitutes an attack by yakku who have "cast down" their "look" (b?lma halanava), as people say, upon Lanka, is one of distiya "falling'' on, and "covering" body. Often, in response to an inquiry after someone, for instance, one might be told that "a distiya^ has fallen on that person's body" {eyata ?ngata distiyak v?tila tiyenava); or else, "a distiya has covered that person's body" {eyata ?ngata distiyak vahila tiyenava). An af? flicted person might then be spoken of as "having" a distiya {distiyak tiyenava).</page><page sequence="9">93 meaning that his or her body "has" in some sense the malevolent, disturbing energy of "the look." Or again, a person's body may be said not simply to "have" a distiya, but more specifically Jo have it "in" or "on" it?eyage ?nge distiyak tiyenava (that person's body has a distiya in/on it). Here it is the locative form of the noun ?nga (body) that expresses the disposition of distiya. And indeed this more definite location of distiya can be even further specified in those not un? usual instances in which the adjective "?tule" is used to give a positive sense of distiya actually being "inside" or better, "within," the body of the afflicted person (?nga ?tule distiyak tiyenava). In a Sinhala sense, therefore, one "has" this malign eye-energy, or else the body has it "in, "on," or even "within" it. This curious ambiguity in the spatial ar? rangement of the Sinhala body, far from warranting the kinds of assumption made by the anthropology of "posses? sion," requires a patient attempt to trace out the relations between the body and eyesight that the Sinhala discourse of yakk? constructs. For if anything is clear it is that this body is not organised as the same kind of spatial organism as is the Western/Christian body. But if in? deed there is little or no significant dif? ference between "having" a distiya, hav? ing a distiya "in" or "on" the body, or having a distiya "within" the body, what kind of body is this, we might ask, that refuses these divisions? To illustrate: One young woman who claimed herself to be afflicted with the distiya of the yak saya named Kalu Kumaraya (the Black Prince) was adamant that distiya does not go "inside" the body even though this might be how it is commonly put. As she articulated it: Distiya does not go inside the body. When a distiya covers anyone's body, "distiya has covered the body," and "the body has a dis? tiya" is said for that; otherwise "the body has a distiya inside" is said. Sometimes many people say, "a distiya is inside the body." (?nga ?tulaa yanne n?h?. distiyak yamkisi kenekuge ?ngata v?hunahama distiya ?ngata vahila tiyenava kiyena ekatay dis? tiyak ?nge tiyenava n?tnam distiyak ?nga ?tule tiyenava kiyala kiyanne. samaharavita hungak minisu kiyanne distiyak ?nga ?tule tiyenava kiyala.) The distinctions, one is tempted to say, are rather of the order of a Sinhala man? ner of speaking. Or as one ?dura42 (or practitioner of the arts of influencing yakku) remarked, it is indeed "inside" that we are thinking. But that is common for wherever in the body .... Generally it [distiya] is an energy. So when a distiya falls on the body you can't say whether it is outside or inside, no. (?tula kiyala tamay api hitanne. namut 'eka ?nge koyibatat ekay .... samanyen eka vegayak. itin ?nga ?tulet ?ngata distiya v?tun?ma eka pita tiyenava da ?tula tiyenava da kiyanna b?ni.) What we are trying to understand here is the kind of body this discourse presupposes, the kind of body it en? visages. And the Sinhala conception that the malevolent energy of eyesight "cover? ing" the body, the body "having" this malevolent energy, and the body having it "within," are virtually one and the same suggests, at the least, a body which is organized as a distinctive sort of spa? tial organism. It would appear that dis? tiya does not go "inside" the body where "inside" is understood as a place where, for example, food and drink go. This is in fact well illustrated in a very interesting way in the following passage about the relation between distiya and food. As Sinhalas have it, certain kinds of foods, specifically oil-mixed food (tel misra k?ma)?such things k?vun and kokis9 for example?are known to attract the dis</page><page sequence="10">94 tiya of yakku as a result of their pungent odor.43 In the course of talking about the relation between ditfiya and food the young woman previously heard from went on to deny emphatically that dis? tiya could enter the body. "Distiya falling on food" means [that] if we, having eaten any food and gone here and there, that distiya covers that food. But a distiya cannot enter the body through the mouth, or nose, or any other means. It is only after eating food that the distiya falls. But before we eat, distiya hasn't fallen on that food. Because of that the distiya cannot go into a body through the mouth or nose. (k?makata distiya v?tenava kiyala kiyanne api yamkisi k?mak kala ivaravala ehe mehe giyot distiya v?tenne ara k?matay. namut distiyakanta katinvat n?tnam nasayenvat ehemat n?tnam venat vidiyakinvat ?nga ?tulata yannama b?h?. k?mak k?vata pasu distiya v?tenava vitaray. namut api k?mak kannata issella distiya e k?mata v?hila tiyenne n?. ~eka nisa kiyanne distiyakata katinvat nasayenvat sarirayakata ?tulu venne b?h?y kiyala.) Eating certain kinds of food, in other words, only subjects the body to a specific kind of vulnerability, i.e., a vulnerability to the effects of malign eyesight. The sur? face of the Sinhala body therefore is not interrupted by cathected orifices which, acting as its structural weakpoints so to speak, or as zones of a hypervulnerabil ity, potentially provide the channels of entry of a supernatural presence. This latter image, as familiar to us from Christianity and from psychoanalysis, depends on a body punctuated by open? ings around which are constructed a whole discourse of danger and desire, and which are central to its regulation and control. At the same time, however, if the metaphor "inside" or "within" (?tule) is nevertheless employed, and if this usage is equivalent to those other forms of Sin hala utterance that convey the disposi? tion of diftiya in relation to the body, what positively is meant? In other words, what kind of "insideness" can there be that is not the inside of a cav? ernous, inhabitable space? The Sinhala body is not a body with organs. Rather it is a body constituted of three vital humors (tun dos): wind (vata), bile (pita), and phlegm (sema). These humorsj contained in the blood (le), flesh (mas), and skin (sam), are the fundamen? tal elements of the body's energic system. Together they form the condition of the body's functioning. The body must be maintained in such a state that these three humors remain in equilibrium; however, any disturbance to the person will result in them becoming "agitated" (va pit sent tun dos kipila, as people say). Ana depending on the severity of that disturbance and its cause, some action will have to be taken to return the body to its balance and equilibrium. All afflic? tions, those caused by the malign energy of eyesight included, register at this energic level of the body's organism. It is ultimately by agitating the humors that the dosayas or ill-effects of distiya are generated. In fact the distiya of certain yakku are understood to have specific ef? fects on particular humors.44 Now, as Sinhalas have it, the distiya that "falls" on and "covers" the body be? comes "attached" (sambandavenava) to, and "contained" (adanguvenava) in it. Consider the following description: "To be contained" means that [distiya] hav? ing come as though by the wind becomes at? tached to the body. When it becomes at? tached to that one [i.e., to the body], because the power that it has is different to [that of] this person's body, a shaking results .... It is in the three, skin, flesh, and blood, that this one [i.e., distiya] is contained .... Then when it [i.e., distiya] has touched the skin it penetrates. (adanguvenava kiyanne vatayen men ?villa sarirayata sambandavenava. ekata sam</page><page sequence="11">95 banda unama arayage tiyene balaya meyage sarirayata venas nisa calitayak ?tivtenava .... sam mas le tun denata meka adangu venava .... etakota d?n samata v?dila vinivida.)45 The Sinhala body we can see there? fore is dependent upon a distinctive set of metaphors. It is in the first place an energic system regulated by the con? tinuous innervation and distribution of the three humors: wind, bile and phlegm. It is a body therefore potentially vulnera? ble to the force of otner energies acting upon or coming into contact with it. One such energy is distiya, the malign energy of the eyesight ot yakku. Distiya, as in the above account, can be likened to the wind. When distiya "touches" and "covers" the body it becomes "attached" to and "contained" in the blood, skin, and flesh. And because of the difference in energy, its touching the body and becom? ing attached to it disrupts the balance of its humors. My argument, then, is that the meta? phor of "possession," unless explicitly qualified, is irrelevant to the Sinhala body. This body offers a conception of a spatial organism that cannot be assimi? lated to the possessed body of Christian and psychoanalytic discourse. The Sin? hala body is an energic organism dif? ferentiated not by a luminous inner es? sence radically marked off from an ex? terior materiality, but rather, systemical ly, by levels and flows; it is, moreover, a body vulnerable not to invasion as though it were a "house" or a "temple" whose owner (the will or soul) could be usurped, but to a reconstitution of ele? ments precipitated by contact with other energies. Malevolence and benevolence are two such energies, and eyesight is their principal modality. DISTIYA AND THE COMPOSURE OF THE SINHALA SELF The idea of the regulation of the humors of the Sinhala body is impor? tant at another level. For this regulated body forms the condition for the constitu? tion of a distinctively variable Sinhala self, a subject potentially exposed to, and thus disciplined by, the subjectifying force of eyesight. One kind of clarification is perhaps necessary at the outset. As is well known, doctrinally Buddhism denies the existence of a "selfit is the doctrine of anatta, the "not-self." This is, as Nyanatiloka puts it, "the only real specific Buddhist doctrine, with which the entire Buddhist structure stands and falls."46 However, to argue on this basis that it is therefore illegitimate to speak analytically about the "self," or more spe? cifically, of "formations of the self in Sinhala Buddhist society is, it seems to me, to confuse conceptual levels. The analytic use of a concept of "self" does not necessarily commit one to the attempt to identify and represent, a priori, some es? sential, eternal, Sinhala Self, an immor? tal Soul inhabiting the body. The concept of "self may mark out, analytically, specific formations of ways of speaking about moral dispositions, vulnerabilities, apptitudes, etc. The important question then, it seems to me, is not whether Sin halas have or do not have a "Self," but rather what kinds of figures, statements, etc., are employed pronominally to mark a distinctive mode of address within so? cial life. My argument is simply that one of the elements that make up such a dis? tinctive Sinhala mode of address is eyesight.47 Eyesight, I have suggested, is linked to the acquisition and organization of</page><page sequence="12">96 distinctive aptitudes and vulnerabilities, and it stands at the center of a whole radiating network of practices through which Sinhalas fashion themselves as, and recognize themselves in, particular kinds of subjects. How do Sinhalas learn to recognize themselves as potentially subject to the modifying force of eyesight? This is the kind of question to which an anthropological concern with formations of the self must address itself. In what follows I can hope only to sketch a provi? sional and partial answer. Sinhala vulnerability to eyesight is connected to the organization of other vulnerabilities to which the Sinhala self is acutely disposed. Perhaps the most im? portant such vulnerability, is the vulner? ability to the possible consequences of "being alone" (taniyama), or the "condition of being alone," or "aloneness" (tanikama). Another, which is in fact in? extricably linked to the condition of being alone is the vulnerability to fright (baya, or hadisibaya). What these vulnerabiliti? es bring sharply into focus, I think, is the importance of composure?presence of mind, as we might say, a regulated equanimity?to Sinhala self-fashioning. I want now to discuss these?the potential danger of eyesight, the condition of being alone, and the disposition to fright?in their relation to the problem of forma? tions and practices of the Sinhala self, particularly those in which it is com? posure that is involved. In discussions of Sinhala subjectivity the concept of tanikama has, it seems to me, been much misunderstood. In the discourse of yakku, the malevolent ef? fects of distiya is often linked to the predisposing condition or state of being alone (tanikama). And indeed the ill effects of distiya are themselves often referred to as tanikam dosa. One of the earliest accounts (in English at any rate) of the relation between yakk? and tanikama is that given by the inimitable Dandris de Silva Gooneratne, When a man is frightened by a demon, and has the influence of that demon on him, it is called TANICAMA, which literally means "loneliness" or "being alone" Fright is in most cases a necessary agent in bringing down Tanicama on that man; but it is also possible that a person, who has neither been frightened by a demon, nor been ten yards from his own door for five or six months, may also get the Tanicama influence on him. In this case, the explanation is that the demon has taken advantage of some un? guarded moment in the daily life of the man, as when he has been sitting in the open com? pound, or when he has happened to go to the back of his house at any of the Yamas, when a demon has happened to be in the vicinity; or when he has eaten roasted fish or eggs, while sitting outside in his Verandah on a Wednesday or Saturday. In this case the man is neither frightened by anything, nor even aware of his danger at the time.48 And he continues, The literal meaning of the word Tanicama gives us a key towards the understanding of many of the mysterious and wonderful cir? cumstances connected with this part of our subject, especially when it is taken in con? nection with the other doctrine of Demonism already alluded to, viz., that, though a demon try his utmost by means of terrible apparitions or by actual seizure to frighten a man and give him the Tanicama, which results in sickness, yet the man will seldom get ill, if he do [sic] not get frightened.49 These passages are extremely valu? able, I think, because they make very clear the connection between tanikama and fright. Fright is typically a necessary condition for "a man to get the Tanicama influence on him." And even where there is no clear instance of fright, the yaka has nevertheless somehow "taken ad? vantage of an unguarded moment" in the victim's daily life. Thus what is common to both situations is the sense of the sud</page><page sequence="13">97 denness of the yaka's action (the swift? ness of the malign glance), and the sense of the victim's unpreparedness and/or ex posure. Similarly, one practitioner of the arts of influencing yakku remarked the indispensable precondition of fright in the following way: At the time that you are going along, [yakku] are waiting to put the_look on your body (yana velava obage sarirayata balma lana innava). Without [your] seeing anything the look is put. However without inducing fright (baya karanna n?tuva) it [i.e., the tanikam dosa] can't be made regardless of the dis? turbance made by the yaksaya. Fright, then, the suddenly precipitated onset of discomposure, is a condition for the malevolent effects of eyesight. However, Gooneratne's insightful passages remain misleading in at least one particular. And it is, I think, an im Eortant one because it is one that has een reproduced and elaborated upon in uncritical ways in the modern anthropol? ogy of the Sinhala yaktovil. Gooneratne translates the word "tanikama" as "loneliness" or "being alone," as though these two English expressions necessari? ly connoted equivalent conditions, equi? valent practices of subjectivity, and were, therefore, equally adequate to the trans? lation of the Sinhala concept. But surely "loneliness" and "being alone" are not the same, and even if for the modern West? ern self they have come to denote almost indistinguishable modes of being it is certainly because of the specific local con? ditions of formation of those selves. And these, needless to say, are not the condi? tions through which Sinhala selves are fashioned. Therefore these two expres? sions do not equally translate the Sin? hala notion of tanikama. Tanikama, I would suggest, is more accurately glossed simply as a condition of "alone ness." So that when Kapferer for ex? ample interprets tanikama as "a state of isolation, of existential solitude in the world,"50 I think he is very much mis? taken. He is not only uncritically recast? ing Gooneratne's conflation in a more up? dated language, but he is investing it with a very specific kind of modernist psychology. For while tanikama does in? volve a mental apartness, so to put it, this does not convey anything of the flavor of that modern Western psychological condition of 'loneliness."51 Discussing this concept of tanikama with an ?dura, S.A. Piyasena, I sug? gested a scenario in which three people are walking along when, suddenly, a noise (sabdaya) is heard by one of tnem. How is it possible, I wanted to know, that in such a situation the condition of that one person who heard the noise could come to be be described as tanikama, and that he or she should fall victim to a tanikam dosa. Piyasena responded thus, in part: When this noise was heard, one's mind ran to that side (sabda ?henakota tamange hita e atata divva). The other two [persons] are not concerned about that noise. It is one's mind that became concentrated on it (ekata tamange Kita yomu una). The mind is drawn to that side (hitalpatata ?dund). It becomes startled (g?ssila). Having heard that noise that person's mind was shaken (e sabdaya ?hila tamange hita helluna) .... Having gone to the head that noise is contained there (mulayata gihilla adanguvela e sab? daya). Going along, you are still thinking about that noise. It has been taken to the head, no. And you think straight away (kelima hitagannava) that this is a yaksaya, a distiya for me. Then by thinking about that one, the blood _becomes agitated (d?n 'eka gena kalpana kirimen le kupitavtenava). In Sinhala conception therefore tanikama is a condition in which the mind (hita) is at once relatively un? disturbed (t?npat) and unguarded. This latter, already suggested in Gooneratne's</page><page sequence="14">98 description, is perhaps the distinctive characteristic of this predisposing condi? tion. One's mind must be relatively un? engaged, attending to some everyday household chore, for example, or taking a bath at the well. There is, on these occa? sions, little to think about in an active, concerted fashion, and so the mind is not being "directed" to, or "concentrating" on (yomuvenava), anything in particular. That is to say it is uncomposea. And it is then, in such a state lacking in com? posure and mental guardedness, that one is potentially exposed to fright and its dreaded consequences. Any small move? ment, a noise, a light, startles the mind, catches it off guard. Let me illustrate this Sinhala self fashioning practice of maintaining the selfs composure and guarding it against the possibility of fright with a small but highly interesting anecdote. It was re? lated to me (in English) by a Sinhala friend, a young man in his early twenties. He had been on his way to his home in the hill country late one eve? ning, he said. Getting off the bus in his home town, he set off on foot for his house. It was dark by then, night having fallen and there being no street lights. Unfortunately he had forgotten his flash? light and therefore he had to make his way without even the company of a little light. Becoming somewhat alarmed at his situation, he said, he "took his mind in his hand" and proceeded on his way, secure in the knowledge that, so "hold? ing" his mind, he was no longer in danger of being startled and therefore unsteadied by a sudden noise or sight. In this extraordinary metaphor I suggest?keeping the mind in the sure grip of the hand?a distinctive practice of Sinhala self-fashioning is illustrated. The composure of the mind is disposed to being disturbed, disrupted, and therefore it must be guarded. Putting his mind in the safety of his hand was a precaution ary measure. By so doing this young man had secured himself against ms vulnera? bility to fright and therefore to the pos? sibility of the malign energy of eyesight falling on him. It follows from whatl have said thus far then that tanikam dosa, the ill-effects of distiya, cannot be translated as "alone illnes/as Kapferer does ? This is mis taken not only because it conveys too much of the flavor of the modern West? ern psychological condition of loneliness, and the psychopathological disorders now associated with it. More important? ly, the dosa or ill-effects in the case of tanikam dosa do not derive from the con? dition itself of being alone, or of being by oneself (as indeed is suggested in the Western conception of the psychological state of 'loneliness"). Rather it derives, as I have shown, from the condition of vulnerability to which such a state of tanikama disposes one, specifically a vul? nerability to a fright that, as we might say, catches one off guard and disturbs one's composure?a fright, of course, in? variably associated with the malign ener? gy of the eyesig[ht of yakk?. And this fright sets in motion a train of events familiar to all Sinhalas. As a result of the fright, the mind, as Piyasena put it, is "drawn" toward the noise and becomes "concentrated" on it. As Piyasena continued, It [i.e., the noise] is taken to one's mind (hitata hitagannava). And one's thoughts become solely about that (tamange kalpanava niterama "ekagena). When thinking about that one [the noise] one's blood becomes unclean (ekagena kal pana karanakota tamange le apirisidu venava). That means the blood, the blood in the body, be? comes lifeless due to the state of fright in the mind (kiyanne le sariraye le, ara kite bayagatiyata, apranika venava). The phlegm (sema) becomes agitated. The wind (vataya) be? comes agitated. And having become agitated, fever results (una h?duna)P</page><page sequence="15">99 It is this consuming thinking that, as it were, heats up the blood and results in the familiar dosas. Then one can say that one is "touched by an aloneness" (tanikamak v?dila), or else that "an aloneness has occurred" (tanikamak vela). It is clear from the foregoing discus? sion therefore that when Sinhalas be? come victims of the malign glances of yakku9 there is no "lapse," as some would have it, into a "lower or "basal" self, one dormant, closer to nature, and ready to "emerge" and disrupt the order of "cul? ture." There is no "negation" of a "dominant" self by a "demonic" one.54 This demonological conception merely replays a nineteenth century Orientalist theme about the submerged demonism of Asiatics.55 Rather, as I have tried to sug? gest, crucial to the fashioning of the Sin? hala self is a centering notion of com? posure and a corresponding zone of vul? nerabilities. And malign eyesight is, preeminently, the force (whose index is fright and whose predisposing condition is "aloneness") that potentially disrupts and reorganizes this composure. CONCLUSION This essay has constituted something of a detour. My argument, however, is a quite simple one, namely, that unless we are prepared to accept anthropological analyses in terms of demonological as? sumptions and presuppositions about the intrinsic efficacy of specific, historically constituted cultural forms, we cannot un? derstand the Sinhala yaktovil until we try to understand the local poetics of eyesight that informs the Sinhala dis? course of yakk?, and particularly the minor practices of gurukama. But my effort in this essay has also been of a more general character. It has been to highlight a point that I think is far too often obscured in accounts, des? criptions, and analyses of the cultural practices of the West's Others. And this point might be posed in the following way: If anthropology, as is now so often claimed, is supposed to be about the in? terpretation of the signs of Others, and in virtue of this a semiotic practice (and there are at least some of us who would wonder about this assumption), what is far less problematized, and regrettably, is the fact this practice is itself always a discursively and institutionally con? stituted one. And as such the fundamen? tal categories and metaphors that organize its authoritative readings, its problematic, are always part of a determinate history and a determinate economy of power. In other words, the semiotic practice which has inscribed Sinhala local knowledge and practice within a thematics of demonism and pos? session, and which in so doing has only sought images of itself elsewhere, remains part of the less than fully inter? rogated legacy of the discursive relation between anthropology, Christianity, and colonialism.

Yaka, or yaksaya, is the Sinhala form of the Pali yakkha and the Sanskrit yaksa. Unraveling the history of this word and the range of conceptions attached to it has posed many problems for scholars of Indian philosophy and mythology?complexities which need not detain us here. However, see variously, Ananda L. Coomaraswamy, Yaksas (New Delhi: Munishiram Manoharlal, 1971); O.H. de A. Wijesekera, "The Philosophi? cal Import of Vedic Yaksa and Pali Yakkha," University of Ceylon Review 1 (5): 24-33 (1943); and M.M.J. Marasinghe, Gods in Early Buddhism (Kelaniya: Vidyalankara Campus Press, 1974). 22. Lit., "the island mountain of yaksayas" 23. In point of fact distiya is not always malign, nor is it always associated with yakku. One can, for instance, speak of deva distiya, meaning the beneficent es? sence or energy of the eyesight of a god. But certainly, in its most common usage distiya is associated with yakku and their malign eyesight. 24. To be fair, though, Gananath Obeyesekere has remarked, in the course of a passage on the way "yaksha mis? fortunes arise," that 'When a demon's look falls on a person or object, the latter is infused with the spirit or essence of the deity known as dishti" (see "The Ritual of Sanni Demons," Comparative Studies in Society and History 11 (2) 1969, p. 175). This characterization of distiya as the "essence" of the yaka is, I think, an ac? curate one, and I have in large part adopted it. It seems to be necessary to add however that distiya can also be said to be the energy of the eyesight of yakku, or again their malevolent propensity. 25.

In my essay, "Anthropology and Colonial Discourse: Aspects of the Demonological Construction of Sinhala Cultural Prac? tice" (manuscript), I have made a detailed analysis of one recent contribution to this general theme. 40. The image of "possession" has a long and varied Christian history. The Apostolic Fathers, for example, made a distinction between "obsession" in which the Devil or demons attacked a person's body from without, and "possession" in which they actually entered it and attacked it from within. And one of the great questions was whether the Devil and his em misaries the demons, having entered the body, could also enter the mind. See Jef</page><page sequence="18">102 frey Burton Russell's Satan: The Early Christian Tradition (Ithaca: Cornell Uni? versity Press, 1981). 41. Perhaps one would need to begin with Obeyesekere's remark that the "essence [Le. distiya] of the demon resides in the patient." It seems to me, however, that this very notion of the "residence" of the malign "essence" of yakku suggests but leaves unproblematized that cultural thematics of the Sinhala body which is precisely what needs to be inquired into. 42. Lit., "teacher." 43. It might be useful to recall here that yakku never actually eat food (as much as they would like to). The Buddha has ex? pressly forbidden it on account of their former cannibalistic ways. They can therefore only "imbibe the tasted" (rasa uranava) of food with their desiring eyes. This is the meaning of the concept seman gannava, "to feast with the eyes." 44. One is of course reminded of the Hip pocratic body of Western medical dis? course which was dominant up until the eighteenth century. For a discussion of the Sinhala humoral theory of the body, see Gananath Obeyesekere, "The Impact of Ayervedic Ideas on the Culture and the Individual in Sri Lanka," in Charles Les? lie (ed.), Asian Medical Systems: A Com? parative Study (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976). 45.

Gooneratne, pp. cit, p. 47 (his emphasis). Wednesday and Saturday are kemmura davas days, when it is especially auspi? cious to ask favors from the devas or gods. 49. Ibid., p. 48. 50. Kapferer, op. cit, p. 50. 51. Lest I be misunderstood, I should note that I am not committing myself to the idea that Sinhalas do not experience "loneliness," that is a condition not only (not even necessarily) of being by oneself, but of a sort of bereftness. They may or they may not experience something that may be so described. What I am suggest? ing, however, is that this is not what is meant by tanikama, and that therefore it is not the condition that exposes one to fright and the effects of malign eyesight. 52. Kapferer, pp. cit 53. It is necessary to point out that this idea of the potential "uncleanness" or "im? purity" of the blood has little to do with those ideas about the relation between purity and caste that are so familiar in the anthropological literature on South Asian cultural practices. 54. This is Kapferer's general thesis. See Kapferer, op. cit. 55. I have, in a recent essay, "Conversion and Demonism: Colonial Christian Discourse and Religion in Sri Lanka" (manuscript), shown how this theme emerged in West? ern discourse about Sinhala cultural practice.</page></plain_text>
