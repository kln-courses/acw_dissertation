<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction The Jardin du Calvaire lies just south of the 12th cen- tury church Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre and east of its sacristy; on the south it is bounded by the 1889 city reservoir and to the east by a terrace wall dating to the construction of the Sacre Cocur in the 1870s (FIG. 1). This 1,000 sq. m. archaeological reserve is a rare resource in a much-disturbed urban environment, accessible to research while provisionally closed to the public. Patrick Perin, who teaches Merovingian Archaeology at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, (EPHE) IVe Section, Elrst studied Roman, Merovin- gian, and Medieval vestiges which had been uncovered around the church in the past.l Among these vestiges 1. I owe many thanks to Mr. Peorin, not only for permission to publish, but for carefully working over the manuscript with me and for making the plans and photographs available. More thanks are due to Mr. Laurent Renou, to the staff of the Archaeological Department of the Musee Carnavalet, and to Mr. Michel Fleury, Director of Historical Antiquities for the Paris Region, and his staff, for their help in preparing the illustrations. Merovingian and medieval tombs discovered during the construction of the Sacreo Coeur in 1875 are described in a short article by R. de Fleury (cf. fn. 9 for full reference); subsequent finds, made during repair and restoration work around Saint-Pierre, are described by M. Vieillard-Troiekouroff et al. (cf. fn. 9), who also provide a thorough summary of the source material and a bibliography for the history of the church. H. Sauval discusses traditions for two ancient temples, one dedicated to Mercury and one to Mars, on Montmartre; he also describes vestiges still visible in his time (Histoire et recherches des antiquites de la ville de Paris [Paris, 17241 t. Is 349-51). Th. Vacquer saw and roughly sketched a number of substructions uncovered during various l9th century excavations; one such ground plan which shows a central cella of 13 m. x 16 m. surrounded by a buttressed rectangular enclosing wall 27 m. x 48 m. has been published (F.-G. de Pachtere, Paris a l'eopoque gallo-romaine fParis 19123 fig. 13), but its location was not indicated in the notes were the foundations of a temple of which Theodore Vacquer, Paris's Elrst municipal archaeologist, left a sketch.2 Laurent Renou of the EPHE transposed the sketch onto a modern plan to show part of these foun- dations passing under the garden and the church. Trapezoidal Merovingian sarcophagi were also ob- served by the Vicar of Saint-Pierre during recent restoration works. These implied that a church already existed there in Merovingian times and lent support to the presumption that a Christian ediE1ce with cemetery supplanted a pagan sanctuary.3 Excavations alone could test this hypothesis; they were arranged with the accord of M. Michel Fleury, Director of Historical An- tiquities in the Paris region, and of the Vicar, the Abbe from which it was taken (Bibliotheque historique de la Ville de Paris, fonds Vacquer, dossier 28 fol. 158 160, 187 &amp; 188). This has led to controversy as to where this temple was situated and as to whether Vacquer saw one temple or two. M. Pewrin discovered in the Vacquer notes a hitherto unknown plan (fol. 179); in Archeologia 107 (Paris juin 1977) 8-9 he explains how this vindicates the two-temples theory and helps to locate the temple which tradition ascribes to Mars beside Saint-Pierre. 2. Vacquer, who supervised archaeology in Paris from 1844 to 1898, left voluminous notes now conserved as the Fonds Yacquer at the Bibliotheque historique de la ville de Paris, but never organised his observations or published. The plan in question is in Dossier 28, folios 179 and 188, where a note in Vacquerss handwriting identifies it as the Temple of Mars. 3. For the association of church and cemetery in Merovingian Paris, cf. P. Peorin, "Les caracteres geoneraux des necropoles meorovingiennes de la Champagne du Nord et de Paris," Septentrion 3 (1973) 23-36. The pagan sanctuary would have been the Temple of Mars of Sauval (cf. fn. 4) Archaeology in an Urban Setting: Excavations at Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre, Paris, 1 975- 1 977 Bailey K. Young Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique Paris, France Excavations organised by P. Perin of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes {IVe Section), Paris, have been underway since 1975 in the Jardin du Calvaire which adjoins the Church of Saint-Pierre in Montmartre. Various traditions and 19th century public works suggested a religioas use of the site in the Roman and early Medieval periods. Excavation shows that these levels were badly disturbed by the great Benedictine abbey (f7. 1147-1790). The evolution of the cloister area and the part of the church adjacent to it is being clariSied, and the excavation of Medieval and early modern tombs throws new light on burial practises.</page><page sequence="2">320 A rchaeology in an Urban Setting.

In three digging campaigns Mr. Perin and the author, assisted by students from the seminar, have ex- plored about half the surface available. The provisional results demonstrate the ravages wrought in a much built-over environment, and the need to exploit fully and harmonize the various archaeological and documentary sources to make a balanced reconstruc- tion of site history. Antique and Early Medieval Montmartre The tradition that a Temple of Mars stood on the south bluff and a Temple of Mercury farther west was known to early modern erudits.4 Early Medieval sources which refer to the bluff as Mons Martis or Mons Mer- curis confirm the durability of popular memory.5 But though we know that impressive vestiges of antique walls stood into modern times, archaeological testi- mony is meager.6 The extent or the character of occupa- tion during the Late Empire remains totally obscure. Nor do we know when a Christian church was first established on the site. Gregory of Tours (d. 594) does not mention one in his list of Paris churches, but perhaps because he considered Montmartre too far out of town. The Elrst direct reference to a church occurs in the 9th century Miracles of Saint Denis, by which time it is clearly an important stage on pilgrimage to the great royal abbey.7 The church belonged in 1096 to the Count of Melun; in 1133 King Louis VI acquired it in order to establish a community of Benedictine sisters. Pope Eugenius III himself consecrated the new church in 1147,8 in the presence of the royal court and with Ber- 4. F.-G. de Pachtere, op. cit. (in note 1), 40-41, cites Sauval, who in 1657 was shown vestiges of a temple dedicated to Mars in the priory garden. De Pachtere, as well as other authors, identified the supposed vestiges near Saint-Pierre with a temple sketched in another note of Vacquer's (Dossier 28, folio 151) labelled Temple of Mercury, but Mr. Perin's research shows that this temple must have been on the west side of Montmartre, so that what Vacquer saw on the south bluff near Saint-Pierre could have been Sauval's Temple of Mars. 5.

Hilduin, Abbot of Saint Denis, popularised ca. 840 the legend that the saint was beheaded on the hill of Montmartre. In 1080 the church there was designated as a place of exhibit for the saint's relics, surely a sign of strong attachment to the great royal abbey. P.

Until the French Revolution seized its property and guillo- tined the last Abbess this proud Benedictine foundation dominated the history of the butte de Montmartre. Since 1875, when work on the Sacre Coeur laid bare a group of plaster sarcophagi east of Saint-Pierre's apse, evidence of an extensive Merovingian and Medieval cemetery surrounding the church has emerged.9 The 1875 sarcophagi included decorated panels: geometric, cross, and chrism motifs (FIG. 2) as well as undisturbed skeletons with funeral furnishings (arms, personal orna- 9.

Other sarcophagi have been noted west of the portal, and also within the church where the only stone sar- cophagus was found." Thus there was reason to sup- pose, after the Abbe Huerre salvaged a decorated plaster panel from a trench dug by a laborer in 1947, that a part of the early medieval cemetery was intact un- der the Jardin du Calvaire. 10. The material has disappeared but Fleury, op.cit. (in note 9) has left usable drawings, and a photo in the Musee Carnavalet shows decorated sarcophagus panels. 11. This is now preserved in the Jardin du Calvaire; the large end is partly broken. The 1975-77 Excavations: Pre-Benedictine Montmartre Trial trenches were dug to intercept the south and west cella walls, as well as the west enclosing well, of Vacquer's temple, as plotted by Renou on a modern area map. The results were negative. Everywhere we found a modern rubble fill, 1.30 m. thick, composed of a compact mass of stone and plaster fragments un- doubtedly spread to create a flat terrace at the time of building the Sacre-Coeur. Under it we found remnants of two destroyed tombs above two disturbed occupa- tion levels, a V-shaped ditch, and the corner of a Medieval building with a stone drain. A trial-trench opened NE of the apse (FIG. 3, S4) disclosed, under 1.50 m. of modern disturbance, two Gallo-Roman occupa- tion levels: the vestiges of a slight earthen wall (remains are 12 cm. high) rest upon a stratum that yielded sherds of a thick orange-slip ware (a crude sigillata). This Gallo-Roman occupation level has subsequently turned</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field A rchaeology/ Vol. 5) 1978 323 Figure 4.

Arch., Museoe Carnavalet). up elsewhere and sherds of the same type (some decorated with molded relief or with parallel incisions) in later levels show where it was completely destroyed. But it is striking that no evidence for stone-built Roman structllres has been found, nor any Elne pottery or coins deriving from the early Empire.'2 It is hard to believe that Vacquer, the meticulous and reliable observer of Parisian archaeology for half a century,l3 imagined the structure he sketched. Did he situate it inaccurately in the sketch in folio 179? Could such foundations have been totally destroyed by subsequent terracing work? Or did Vacquer, aware of the tradition for a Temple of Mars, mistake some lengths of medieval wall for part of its foundations, and simply extrapolate the rest? The temple remains to be found, if anything is left. We did discover the bottoms of two razed Merovin- gian sarcophagi in place just outside of the old transept wall. Figure 4 shows one whose upper right-hand cor- ner has been cut away by a medieval wall buttress. A plaster panel decorated with an equal-armed cross in- scribed in a circle, recovered by the Abbe Huerre in 1947, belonged to the foot of this tomb. The sar- cophagus has a west (head) - east (feet) orientation slightly inflected to the north. These tomb bottoms are only about 50 cm. beneath the present garden surface, a fact that indicates that in the early Middle Ages the slope surface was about 1 m. higher than it is today. The floor inside Saint-Pierre, established in the 12th century, is about a meter above the garden terrace. In 12. This poverty contrasts with the rich early Imperial finds at the villa of the Fontaine du Bu; cf. note 6. 13. Cf. note 2. Vacquer learned precision from his training as an architect. The construction of an underground parking lot at the Rue Sofflot in 1973 turned up walls within centimeters of where his notes indicated them. Figure 5. Early Medieval terracotta antefix found in fill over Roman level, NE of apse (S4) (Photo: J. Chafotte, Dept. Arch. Muse'e Carnavalet). an area further west where the Abbe H uerre had reported having seen Merovingian tombs we found a row of burials that were Medieval or later, laid out between two parallel N-S walls belonging to the Benedictine cloister. There were abundant debris of earlier tombs. No intact Merovingian burials have been found so far. Material attributable to the period is largely con- fined to potsherds (the largest is the fragmentary flat base of a dark grey biconic vase measuring 17 cm.) and hunks of broken plaster sarcophagus (one of these, bearing a circular molded decor, was part of the footings of a Medieval floor). The most striking artifact turned up in the rubble fill above the two Roman levels NE of the apse. It is an antefix in red terracotta, 15 cm. high, which presents a staring human mask, the mouth wide open, the head topped with a cross (FIG. 5). The antefix belongs to a series known in the Paris region;'4 14. One such antefix-masks found at the rue Vaugirard in 1897, resembles our example so closely that the two must have come from the same mould. Variants have been found in the old Saint Marcel cemetery and in a church in Saint Denis. All are preserved at the Muse'e Carnavalet and will be published by Mr. Pe'rin in a forthcom- ing article.</page><page sequence="6">324 A rchaeology in an Urban Setting: Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre, Paris/ Young other types have turned up in Central France and Ac- quitaine. 15 The production of such objects clearly derives from Roman traditions; M. Perin suggests that this one was used to decorate the exterior of the early church, fixed to the end of the roof, for example. The intensely-rendered expression is meant to "ecarter le demon", that is, keep the evil forces away from the sacred precincts. The mask would thus constitute, along with the marble capitals and columns re-employed in the nave of Saint-Pierre,'6 the only surviving vestiges of the early Medieval church yet identified. Benedictine Montmartre: Transept and Ossuary(?) A series of trenches extending along the south wall of Saint-Pierre disclosed that the original transept was slightly salient. It extended almost 3.5 m. from the current closing wall of the church, which is a l9th cen- tury restoration. Figure 6 shows the west end of this wall (M-1), constructed of large, rough-cut stones firm- ly mortared together, and the later addition M-17: the original round-angled cornerstone is visible near the bottom of the vertical meter rod. It lines up exactly with the current transept buttress. The west end of this original transept closing wall disappears into a thick, semicircular mass of very solid masonry (FIG. 7). When the topmost mortar was picked away it revealed a right- angled corner buttress whose corner lines up exactly with the current eastern transept buttress. Thus it would seem that the original (1147 A.C.) right-angled corner buttress was found to be inadequate, so it was engulfed in the thick mass of stone and mortar. Part of the foundation ditch of this structure was in- tact: it yielded sherds of flammule (FIG. 8) and of green- glazed pottery that J. Nicourt, the most recent student of Medieval Parisian ceramics, would date to the end of the 12th or the early 13th century.'7 This date coincides with the terminus ante quem provided by a rather fragile silver denier of Chartres found at the bottom of this ditch; the coin clearly had circulated little. Thus the repairs would have been accomplished by the beginning 15. J. Chapelot, "Les antefixes de terre cuite d'e'poque carolingienne en France", Revue Archeologique du Loiret 2 (1976) 46-56, catalogues 40 such finds. His assertion that they are Carolingian, however, is archaeologically unproved and improbable. E. Salin, La Civilisation Merovingienne, t.IV (1959) 278-81 discusses the series, but his con- clusions are subject to caution. 16. Some authors, like de Pachtere, op.cit. (in note 4) 40, note 3, con- sider these columns and capitals to be antique. D. Fossard, "Les chapiteaux de marbre du VIIe siecle en Gaule," Cahiers archeolog- iques II (1947) 69-85, argues that they are Merovingian. 17. J. Nicourt, Essai de classification des ceramiques medievales parisiennes (Thesis of the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes, IVe Sec- tion, Paris, 1974) Type C-13a. of the 13th century. The three exterior buttresses to the transept closing wall are also later additions. Attached to the massive transept buttress at its base were the foundations of a small, flimsy building (FIG. 7). A weak wall, consisting largely of broken plaster sar- cophagus chunks (bound by a crumbly chalk mortar) resting on the sand, runs 5 m. east of the buttress, turns north, and disappears into a zone of recent disturbance. A continuous layer of thin, pulverized chalk that joins this wall to the buttress base suggests that they were built at the same time. Between the two we found a floor: a flat surface of hard, chalky mortar resting on a bed of stones and sarcophagus fragments. This floor would have been 2 m. below the Medieval ground sur- face. What purpose could the structure have served? M. Fleury, who observed similar poorly built underground structures at the church of the Saints-Innocents, sug- gests it could have served as a temporary repository for the bones of old graves destroyed when new ones are dug. Whatever its purpose, it did not remain long in use. Part of the floor was cut away to create a bone pit, and over this pit a child's tomb (of the typical medieval "funeral cavern" type) was established. Prominent charcoal stains on the floor, overlain by a dense amalgam of stone, chalk, and plaster fragments fused together, bear witness to the destruction. This level is sealed off by two other tombs, one of them enclosing a type of vase that dates to the period of the end of the 13th to mid-14th century, by which time the building was destroyed. The Cloister Complex Archival research has so far failed to turn up a reliable plan of the Benedictine cloister.'8 When the parallel walls M-7 and M-10 were uncovered in 1975 their situation and spacing (about 2.75 m. apart) suggested they could be the foundations of the east gallery. Subsequent excavation further west disclosed two walls similarly spaced, and, interestingly enough, the same distance from the still-visible old well in the garden as walls 7 and 10. Sections of the north gallery wall, including the NW inner corner, have also been excavated. They suggest a cloister with overall dimen- sions of 20 m. x 24 m. The cloister must have been built later than the original 1147 transept, for it takes its 18. Lesourd, op.cit. (in note 7) 54, reproduces a plan of the 18th cen- tury attributed to the Abbey of Montmartre. It does not depict the church as it now stands (it adds a crossing to the nave and makes the apses flat instead of polygonal). The source of Lesourd's plan is an 18th century watercolor kept in a carton marked Montmartre in the National Archives (Cartes et Plans, N.III, Siene 736) but bearing itself no written mention of the Abbey. M. Perin believes it depicts an idealised monastery and was erroneously classed with the Montmar- tre material during the l9th century.</page><page sequence="7"> Journal of Field A rchaeology/ Vol. 5, 1978 325 Figure 6.

Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre, Paris/Young Archaeological Department of the Musee Carnavalet, dates in the 13th century (FIG. 9). The problem of collecting and storing water was dif- ficult for a community living high above the water table. One attempt to deal with the problem may be represented by a deep wall (NW of the old well) whose eastern face is plastered with a 10 cm. coating of thick, water-resistant clay. The wall seems to be part of a rec- tangular reservoir enclosing a well-built stone cistern (now dry). Further excavation in this area is impeded by the proximity of large trees. 19 Burials Plaster sarcophagi, trapezoidal in shape and wholly made up of moulded panels, decorated or not, were a major industry in Merovingian Paris.20 Such sarcophagi are characteristic of the 7th century, but are known also in the 6th century and they continue to be made in the 8th century. A number of decorated sarcophagi (FIG. 2) (and more undecorated) were turned up in 1875 and 1891 west and east of the present church; another was noted under the nave in 1899. Our excavations attest only to the destruction of such sarcophagi in the area south of the church, and confirm the west-east orienta- tion. Dressed burial was practised in the sector east of the apse, as elsewhere in Merovingian Paris;2l but the tombs found under the Rue de Mont Cenis, to the west, were apparently unfurnished. The Medieval type of tomb we have called "funeral cavern" is made up only partly of moulded plaster: the inner surfaces are smooth but the sides are made up of a rubble mixture which may include bones of earlier burials (FIG. 11). The shape is rectangular, or nearly so; in some cases one finds the shape of a human head out- lined at the west end, as in tomb 13/a (this type, called "anthropomorphic", was also noted at the Saints-Inno- cents). Groups of these tombs, aligned and oriented W-E were found in two sectors, Trenches 8 and 13 (FIGS. 10- ll), at about the same depth. All must have been re- used no covers were found, and displaced bones were numerous so their dating cannot yet be closely fixed. The two Jlammule vases found sitting alongside the sar- cophagus 13/a (FIG. 8) thus offer only a terminus ante 19.

If the cloister was built at the same time the buttresses were added, as seems plausible, the begin- ning of the 13th century would seem a likely date. The discovery of two intact vases (one glazed, one Jlammulet) in a pre-cloister stratigraphic context sup- ports the view that it could not have been built much before 1200: the vases are of a type Nicourt dates to the mid-12th century. Since the foot-end of the tomb 8/p extended slightly into the undisturbed sandy soil under wall M-7, this suggests that the eastern gallery of the cloister was already in place when the tomb was dug. It seems likely that the gravediggers miscalculated the length and had to enlarge the pit to fit in the foot panel of this "funeral cavern". Unfortunately, the intensive use for burials of most areas so far excavated, as well as modern disturbances, has so disrupted the stratigraphy and impoverished the site that we cannot offer a de- tailed reconstruction of the cloister's character and development.

This type of tomb was still being built after the destruction of the flimsy edifice in Trench 7 (tomb 7/a overlies it) and after the construction of the eastern cloister gallery (which tomb 8/f undercuts). Thus it certainly begins as early as the 14th century and very probably goes back into the 13th as well. Tomb 13/n (FIG. 10) iS of a somewhat different type: it is a composite sarcophagus made up of stone slabs, and its axis is turned more northwards than that of the neighboring funeral cavern 13/c (which infringes on its side, and thus postdates it). Tomb 13/n may be a tran- sitional type of sarcophagus between the Merovingian and the Medieval types; its orientation is similar to that of the former. A number of burials without sar- cophagus, sometimes with clear traces of a wooden cof- fin, occured in almost every sector where there was room for them. They cannot be limited to any one period: one of them in Trench 9 underlies the cloister, another in Trench 7 rests upon the debris of the putative ossuary, and a series of these graves under the cloister gallery (stratigraphically above the funeral caverns) is certainly early modern. There is no doubt that wooden coffins were the normal mode of burial in the modern period. The body position observed in intact burials was the same: the arms were carefully folded over the chest, the legs together. This position is rare in rural cemeteries in the Merovingian period, but it has been observed in urban Christian contexts (e.g., Saint-Laurent of Choulans, Lyon)22 and lately in presumably post- Merovingian rural contexts in the Paris region.23 This 22.

But there is no proof that the Medieval custom was inspired by the earlier, nor whether it was a regular or an exceptional practise. One of the tombs found under the eastern cloister gallery (Trench 8, FIG. 12) provided surprising evidence for "dressed burial" in a recent monastic context. The burial was in a shallow wooden coffin in an area much disturbed by post-Medieval inhumations.

The custom of deposing aflammule vase, pierced with holes, in or beside the tomb, was a Medieval Parisian funeral practise that has been attested for some time.24 A bas-relief depicting the funeral procession of Prince Louis (d. 1260), the son of Saint Louis, shows pots of this type pierced and smoking (no doubt from incense sprinkled on hot coals).25 The vase types discovered at Montmartre in association with tombs all date between the end of the 13th and the middle of the 14th centuries. The chronological limits for this rather particular revival of "grave-goods," however, need to be more definitely fixed. The Merovingian custom of placing a ceramic pot, usually biconic, in the tomb was certainly 24. Nicourt, op.cit. (in note 17). 25.

The Abbess of Montmartre had a dream that made her quickly reverse her decision and send for the Lorraine sisters. They did not stay long, for after a few years Mechtilde led them off to found a new house. Our Sister Mary Magdelane (for this is the religious name inscribed on our subject's silver ring) was buried wearing the cross of Lorraine around her neck-a strik- ing co-incidence. Did one of Sister Mechtilde's group die at Montmartre? Or could this be the Abbess Marie- Anne de Lorraine-Harcourt herself? Or her successor, also of the noble House of Lorraine, the great patron of Benoisteveaulx? Was it a sign of rare privilege to be buried with such tokens, or merely a mark of a momen- tary fashion? (Another religious medal was found in disturbed levels nearby; it could have accompanied a burial.) In all events, the tomb supports historical sources that show an important link between Montmar- tre and Lorraine in the latter 17th century. Site History in the Light of the Excavations Occupation in the Roman period is attested, but only in disturbed levels that give no hint of its character. Terracing work associated with the Medieval cloister complex cut into the earlier slope of the bluff, destroy- ing most of the vestiges of the early middle ages. It is possible that the 12th century church was built upon the earlier; eventual excavation within the church could confirm this. Further excavation will certainly help restore the plan of the cloister area and clarify its evolution: the recent discovery of two superimposed late Medieval floors attached to the western gallery wall, and of elements of Gothic ornament reused in another wall indicate a complex evolution.27 One is, on the whole, struck by the poverty of the material culture found on a site that documentary sources show to have been wealthy. Sculptured stone and metal, including coins, are rare; even glassware is lacking. It may be that the Benedictines themselves, when they moved downhill from the old Abbey to the modern Priory in the 1 680s, began the process of despoiling the ornament. The destruction of the Revolution and the neglect of the l9th century further degraded the site. 27. The 1977-78 excavations uncovered a stretch of wall foundations under the north cloister gallery which are almost entirely made up of re-used stonework, some of it clearly deriving from a Medieval cloister (a quatrefoil pillar base, for example, and cloister capitals). Sherds of glazed pottery which date rather far along in the Middle Ages occured in the foundation ditch of this structure, leading us to suppose that the old cloister was razed to make way for a new one in the early Modern Period. The poverty of the material culture lends weight to the reflection that excavations, at best, offer an in- complete, at worst a misleading image of the historical reality they try to discern. Interpretation must make the most of all the source material available. But the point is worth making: excavation is our best source of fresh information. As urban sites live under the constant menace of redevelopment it is imperative that their archaeological resources be carefully exploited while time permits. Bailey K. Young received his Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 1975. For the past few years he has been working at the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes (I ve Section) in Paris on questions relating to religious mentality and burial practises in the early Middle Ages. A grant by the Centre Nationale de la Recherche Scien- tifique was awardedfor 1977 to further this research. He has been participating in Medieval excavations in Paris (Saint-Pierre-de-Montmartre, Parvis-Notre-Dame) and in the south of France (Saint-Pierre-de-Psalmodi).</page></plain_text>
