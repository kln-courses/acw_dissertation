<plain_text><page sequence="1">By OSSIP K. FLECHTHEIM History: Theodicy or Odyssey IN expressing some concluding remarks on the problem of a scientifi- cally integrated theory of history, I am compelled to cite Heinrich Heine's theme from Verschiedenartige Geschichtsauffassung. Heine says The book of history is subject to numerous interpretations. Two wholly opposed points of view are evident. One group sees in all earthly things nothing but a wretched cycle. In the life of peoples like in that of individuals, and in organic nature in general, they see growth, flowering, decay, and death; spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Their's is the slogan: "There is nothing new under the sun" even this slogan being no longer new since some two thousand years ago the king of the Orient had murmured it. They shrug their soul- ders at our civilization, which is destined to yield to barbarism; they shake their heads at our struggles for freedom, which in the end would only further the rise of new tyrants; they smile at all efforts of political enthusiasm designed to make the world a better and hap- pier place and which, in the end, would cool off without accomplishing anything. In the little chronicle of hopes, needs, misfortunes, pains and joys, errors and disappointments with which the individual spends his life, in that human chronicle they see the history of humankind. . Opposed to the above mentioned "fatally fatalistic" point of view stands a more lucid opinion which approaches the idea of providence more closely. According to that view, all earthly things move towards a more beautiful perfection, and great heroes and heroic epochs are only steps to a higher, god-like state of mankind when the political and moral struggle finally leads to the holiest peace, to the purest brotherhood, and to the most eternal happiness. We were not expelled from paradise by a flaming sword, but we have yet to conquer it with a flaming heart and through love. The fruit of knowledge bringeth not death but eternal life. "Civilization" is the watchword of the ad- herents of such a conception.... Neither conception ... seems to agree too well with our most vital sentiments concerning life. On the one hand, we do not want to vainly spend our enthusiasm by placing our highest stake in what is hopelessly transitory. On the other hand, we also want the present to retain its value and not have it considered only a means, the future being its purpose. Indeed, we feel too im- portant to consider ourselves the means to an end. After all, it rather appears to us that "means" and "ends" are nothing but conventional concepts which man has thought into nature and history, concepts of which the creator knew nothing, each creation being an end in itself and each event conditioning itself, and everything, even the universe itself existing and occurring for its own sake. Life is neither a means nor an end, it is a right. Life seems to claim this right against stif- fening death, against the past, and this very process of claiming is the essence or revolution. The melancholic indifference of historians and poets must not paralyze our energy in this business; and the raving 78</page><page sequence="2">of the saviors of the future must not beguile us into risking the interests of the present, the right to life, and the rights of men that the still in need of defense. "Le pain est le droit du peuple," said Saint- Just, and these have been the greatest words pronouncd during the entire revolution. In some previous articles1 an attempt has been made to trace the development of the philosophy of history from Hegel to Toynbee. The theories propounded by Hegel, Marx, and Toynbee have been criticized as essentially organistic, optimistic and metaphysical. They have been called religious2 ideologies or theodicies since they tend to justify all past and present shortcomings in the light of a final "divine" harmony. On the other hand the scientific, skeptical, and tentative hypotheses of the brothers, Max and Alfred Weber, have been found significant steps towards a fully developed "historical sociology" or "sociological history." Hegel, who was the builder of a closed philosophical system, despite his profound historical interest and understanding, considered history as an integrated element of the world of the Mind, the historical process consisting of no more than one particular kind of wave occurring in the broad eternal stream of Dialectics. The explanation for this position lies in two directions: As for Hegel's historico-social situation, it must be remembered that he had been deeply disappointed by the outcome of the great French Revolution in which he saw proof that "Absolute Free- dom" destroys itself in the process of becoming political and social re- ality. Therefore he hastily seized upon the new equilibrium of the Na- poleonic and Restoration eras to convince himself that the new social order was as reasonable as it could possibly be, and that the philosopher must read into it as much rationality as possible if he wished to avoid sinking into a kind of Hoelderlinian black despair3. Indeed, Hegel set 1. Cf. Phylon, 1941, Vol. II, pp. 238-49; 1942, Vol. III, pp. 46-65, and 1943, Vol. IV, pp. 248- 64. 2. After reconsideration I prefer to use the term religious in quotation marks only in order to make clear that Marx-and some- how even Hegel-did not postulate any per- sonal anthropomorphic Godhead totally inde- pendent of and superior to the universe. In theological terms, his basic philosophy comes closer to "pantheism" than to theism. In much the same way I have made use of the term "religious" (loc. cit. esp. pp. 46, 48, and 55), Max Eastman uses it to characterize Marxism. For Eastman "religion means . . . belief that the external world, or some power in it, is interested in the interests of men. The religious believer persuades himself that the world is softer than it is, and that we know more about it than we do." (Marxism: Is It Science?, 1940, p. 162.) I am taking this occasion to refer the reader to this brilliant book with which I became acquainted only after completing the previous articles. The reader will notice the conformity of views in respect to the main thesis, disagreements in other questions not withstanding. As holds true for so many social and philosophical ideologies, Marxism as ideology strikingly resembles a religious ideology coming closest to that part of a religion called its "Theol- ogy." "All Theology is intellectual rationali- zation of the possession of religious salvation (Heilsbesitz). ... For every theology . . . the assumption is valid that the universe must make sense-and its question is: How has one to interpret it in order to make it intelligible?" (Max Weber, Wissenschaft als Beruf, 1919, p. 34). Marxism as a revolution- any movement, however, differs considera- bly from a purely religious movement which "aims not to change the outside existence, but to change the inner life" and "to incul- cate a new conception of the universe instead of merely seeking to remake institutions or the objective structure of a social order" (H. Blumer, "Collective Behavior," An Outline of the Principles of Sociology, ed. Robert E. Park. 1939, p. 274). 3. Even so the old man continued nurturing some hope that he would see the day when he-the venerated and celebrated head of the Prussian state philosophy! - would be al- lowed to give up the "toilsome business of teaching philosophy" and to exchange his Berlin academic chair for the position of an administrator in the Prussian Department of Education, in which capacity he would be- HISTORY 79</page><page sequence="3">the imagined fulfilment and end of all history into the frame of his own age, his own civilization, even his own state. At the same time he did not hesitate to admit that in spite of all perfection reached the world of the so-called "Objective Mind" (law and ethics, family and civil society, state government and world history) remained inadequate. Even the Prussian state was only an "Earthly-Divine." The "Divine" itself, pure and complete, i.e., the "Absolute Mind," was not to be found in anything spatial and temporal, but only in the super-social and super-historic "eternity" of art, religion, and philosophy. Thus Hegel is one of the most impressive and original representatives of the idea that history has existed in the past but will cease to exist in the future. He was far too clever to ignore the new forces threatening the maintenance of the status quo; but he knew that by incorporating them theoretically into his system, he himself would blow it up. He died just in time to be able to maintain, to the end of his life, his conviction that the only remaining task for mankind to perform consisted in hold- ing fast to the goal reached after such long hardship, to complete the legacy of the past in all its details and to be on guard against all possible retrogression. It is at this point that Marx becomes Hegel's most radical antagonist. For Marx, we have seen, the present is the turning-point, the basis for mankind's leap from the realm of necessity into that of freedom. By way of our scheme4 we have tried to intimate the epochal importance of the present age in Marx' conception. Be it remembered again that the "productive forces developing in the womb of bourgeois society create the material conditions for the solution of that antagonism. This social formation constitutes, therefore, the closing chapter of the prehistoric stage of human society." Consequently, for him, our own age-the stage of capitalism and socialist revolution - signifies far more than a transi- tional epoch within a "Historic Civilization" or even a crisis in the deri- vation of one Historic Civilization from another--it is rather a true Kairos, a real Weltwende, a Third Revolution comparable, if at all, to the "Neolithic Revolution" which separates the Old Stone Age from the New Stone Age, or the "Urban Revolution" which separates Neolithic man from the man of the Historic Civilizations5 - and it is still more far- reaching and deep-going than these two epochal changes. "The pre- historic stage" of the human race, according to Marx, embraces classless societies of promitive communism as well as the "modes of production" come instrumental in making Prussia a per- tute periodical Unter dem Banner des Marx- fect country by appointing his disciples to ismus, 1931, quoted here from memory.) It is, academic positions and thus having the fu- of course, hard to know how seriously Hegel ture state bureacracy educated in the spirit took his dream. of his own philosophy (Cf. his letters pub- 4. loc. cit., p. 52. lished for the first time in the Hegel Centen- 5.

For Hegel history comes to an end with present-day bourgeois society--for Marx this society stands at the threshold of true history. When interpreting Arnold Toynbee's system, one is initially inclined to believe that our age marks neither the end nor the beginning of his- tory. It rather seems to represent but one of the several phases of which any of the numerous Historic Civilizations is composed. Because Toyn- bee's work so far published is preponderantly devoted to the exposition of the rise and decline of Civilizations, it is tempting to consider him the latest representative of the cyclical conception of history, a philosophy so fundamentally opposed to the Occidental Christian conception of history as a theodicy. To the patient reader, however, it is revealed in time that according to Toynbee the Historic Civilizations have been called into existence by a benevolent Godhead mainly in order to give birth to the Universal Churches and their higher religions. And it is Christian- ity which holds the highest place among them (Toynbee is, before all, a devout Christian!). It is Christianity, therefore, which is destined to become the harbinger of a new Transfigured Ethereal Super-Civilization transplanting the Communion of Saints and the Kingdom of God to our planet. And by way of a miracle it is possible that our own civilization and age are chosen by the Christian God to witness this momentous change! Whether we are confronted with Hegel's Weltgeist, whether Marx presents us his clause-conscious proletariat, or Toynbee resorts to the Highest Religion - in every instance it is ideas or elites or gods that turn the wheels of history overcoming the inertia of the masses. They are called upon by the highest authority of the universe to carry out what Lessing called Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts, the education of the human race, and to preside over the business of civilizing the masses. In their hands rests the ultimate responsibility for the promotion of the histories of isolated groups to a world history, which in turn transforms itself into the everlasting harmony of a perfect community. The theological and metaphysical conception of "theodicy" applied originally to a state three-dimensional universe, where earthly evil was but the necessary means of achieving heavenly perfection, and where time was but the beginning of eternity. If placed into a secular, his- torical frame of reference, the term takes on a new meaning. Divine per- fection and goodness are transplanted from the realm of a transcendent heaven to a future Kingdom of God on earth, toward which the his- HISTORY 81</page><page sequence="5">PHYLON torical process is directed. This Millenium retains the qualities of per- fection and goodness are transplanted from the realm of a transcendent death and salvation of the individual, but through mankind's historical progress in time. The secularization and historization of the concept of theodicy is evi- dence for the recognition on the part of philosophers and historians that the religious picture of the universe and of the destiny of man is no longer adequate for the justification of evil which theodicy proposes. They reasoned justly that if history were only a negligible part of the cosmos, it would be subject to the basic inadequacies of all creation, which they had finally come to recognize. Lacking a structure of its own, historical fulfilment would be limited and blocked by the curse of facticity and irrationality, contingency and rigidity. The discrepancy be- tween human imagination and objective reality would pervade the his- torical sphere as well as all other spheres. Bearing all this in mind, they postulated that, through the dialectics of history, the contradictions of thinking and being, of liberty and neces- sity, of rationality and facticity would be eliminated. Man being both producer and product of his culture, the identical subject-object of his- tory, he would surmount the barriers of facticity and infinity which he had himself created. As a result of historical growth and the continuous emergence of new qualities, through the teleological dynamism of the historical process, individual occurrences and isolated events would be mediated into a meaningful whole. The question arises whether this "modernization" of the theodicy concept is tenable on scientific grounds. At first sight, it seems as though the disquieting dependence of history upon nature has been underesti- mated. The failure to appraise the organic and biological aspects of human life and the tendency to forget that homo sapiens underlies the zoon politicon, reveal the ideological nature of the hypothesis. After all, the human race consisting of the dead, the living, and the unborn cannot be considered a living organism endowed with a uniform, single con- sciousness. Whatever methodological value such a marginal concept may have, mistaking it for living reality can only be a source of confu- sion. Whatever history may mean to the "non-existant Man," the exist- ing men destined to live out their short life-span in time and space will always be the victims of its transitoriness and incompleteness. As his- tory moves ahead more rapidly, as historical change gains in scope and depth, and as the historical task grows more challenging, the concom- itant losses are bound to increase in proportion. What was gained yes- terday, is lost today, and will be forgotten tomorrow. In this sense, his- tory, too, is an insatiable devourer of her own children. As the irony of fate will have it, historical man yearning for a permanent part in the in- 82</page><page sequence="6">HISTORY finite drama of history, grows increasingly aware of his biological lim- itations. While some reptile is privileged to enjoy the monotony of natural life for centuries, the zoon politikon has the greatest difficulty to add but one score years to the three and ten or four score that have been meted out for homo sapiens. The tragedy of human limitation is climaxed by the discovery that history's destination remains enigmatic. Although much is now known about the historic - or better prehistoric -beginnings of human de- velopment, and increased knowledge is being accumulated regarding the immediate future, the ultimate destiny of the race remains doubtful. Nobody can yet foretell whether "man and beast can at the best look forward to a diversified agony of twenty million years"6 only to perish with the globe, or whether "for many scores, if not for hundreds of millions of years to come, the earth will continue to be a comfortably habitable abode for creatures like ourselves"7 and man will succeed in moving to other stars in time thus escaping the destruction of the planet8. The historical process in its entirety is beyond our ken. How then dare we call it a theodicy? What holds true for the widest, most comprehensive structure of universal history is reflected in the development of our own civilization. As far as we have the means of forecasting the immediate future, we can discern two alternative roads: our Western society may decline as a result of further wars and revolutions, of crises and disintegrations, leading up to a complete break-down of modern life and a regression in all fields of human achievement. In that event, the collapse of the mod- ern world would bring forth a new "Dark Age." We may witness, on the other hand, during the next century or two, the slow and painful emergence of a world state and planned society, primarily brought about through conquest and revolution, and in part achieved through accom- odation and rational compromise. Whichever the outcome may be, it will not bring absolute perfection and everlasting harmony. If the world equilibrium were ever realized, no matter how closely it would approx- imate a Millenium, the sacrifice involved would be considerable. Who would take it upon himself to balance the happiness of the then living with the misery of past generations? Who could claim that the "Brave New World" would preserve all the values achieved by past generations in addition to its own particular values? Who is qualified to decide whether a refined complicated civilization is "higher," "better," or "godlier" than the most primitive and simple barbarism?

From whatever angle one tries to rationalize the process of history, it will never be possible to build it into a theodicy. Any such attempt is bound to fail because of the basic antinomies and disharmonies of the universe. It is in the nature of human affairs that the optimistic prophets of the millennium should have their pessimistic antagonists. Since the dawn of civilization bitter cries could be heard denouncing mankind's degenera- tion and regression from a Golden Age or a Lost Paradise. There have also been periods during which the recurring cycle of growth and decay was felt to be the paramount law of biological as well as socio-cultural organisms. Change, if acknowledged at all, was minimized because it was thought to be temporary and superficial. "Dust thou art, to dust re- turneth" became the watchword applying not only to man and beast, but to city and nation, class and civilization. The view of history here advocated breaks away from the over-sim- plified monistic conceptions of either progress or cycle. It accepts some elements of both systems as partial insights, stripping them of their claim to absolute truth. It considers them as working hypotheses by incor- porating them into a new, more comprehensive frame of reference. Re- taining the idea of basic change and evolution, the new integration here sought rejects any belief that makes of human history a story of progress and perfectability. On the other hand, it denies with equal determina- tion that all history repeats itself perpetually, returning without fail to its starting point. It has become increasingly evident that history constitutes a most complicated interplay of progress and regression, of rest and movement, of achievement and loss, of development and decadence, of the recurrence of the old and the emergence of the novel. Today more than ever his- tory must be understood in pluralistic terms. Our horizon has been so widened as a result of geographical and historical discoveries, our un- derstanding has become so refined and differentiated due to the century- long process of secularization and rationalization that a monistic key no longer unlocks all doors. While Hegel was still in a position to speak of "den Gang Gottes durch die Weltgeschichte," the forward march of the one God through world history, we can only see, to use the words of Max Weber, "the eternal, forever undecided struggle of the many gods." To trace this struggle, to evaluate the various contenders, to understand their true motivation, and to foretell as correctly as possible the course of their actions, that is the true task of the scientifically minded historian (as soon as he worships at the altar of any one Godhead, he ceases to be a scientist and becomes an activist, a champion for a cause, serving an 84 PHYLON</page><page sequence="8">HISTORY interest other than that of "scientific truth"). Thus the unwieldy and dynamic body of history no longer fits into the strait jacket of a closed system. And yet history possesses a specific unity and a delimited shape. Earth and man, "blood and soil" are its basic substances. Consequently, the need for some sort of a structure arises that would do justice to the aspects of both unity and diversity, space and time. This structure must necessarily remain fragmentary, and the system remain open. Allowance must be made for the consti- tuent factor of historical time, the march of which is unique and irrever- sible. The inherent antinomies must be clarified and, as far as possible, temporarily re-integrated. The system itself, however, cannot provide for their definitive reconciliation and final disappearance. In the process of clarification we discover that time plays a twofold part: It gives birth to history in its "original" and its "derivative" as- pects. On the one hand it seems as though Chronas, the God of Time, has gone through history leaving the past behind "timeless and dead." He has chosen the one reality from the many possibilities, making his de- cision final and irrevocable. On the other hand, future generations con- tinue to reinterpret what has preceded. The future throws its shadow on that timeless and dead material, entering into the past, shaping and reshaping its face. Thus even what was is still becoming, each genera- tion attempting to remould its historical heritage nearer to its own "heart's desire." The irreconcilable antinomy arises between the sub- jectivistic conception of history as a "fable convenue" and the objecti- vistic approach towards history as the narrative of "wie es eigentlich gewesen" (Ranke). Another conflict grows out of the desire of each age to consider itself its own fulfilment. It requests, to use again Ranke's expression, "direct access to God," rejecting to serve as a means for some ulterior purpose. On the one hand, this desire motivates the impressionistic and positivistic historians to emphasize the detail at the expense of the great trends, tendencies, and interdependencies. Methodologically there is no differ- ence between the good old politico-diplomatic historiography and the so- called New History with its emphasis upon the economic, social, and cul- tural detail. On the other hand, the quest for immediacy and immanence tends to degenerate into a pragmatic irrationalism as witnessed in the ideologies of fascism, futurism, and nihilism. As the present takes on paramount importance, the future and the past are deprecated and finally forgotten. History ceases to exist in the face of the fulness of the mo- ment. And yet, inspite of this all-pervading drive to hold on to the fleet- ing hour, we experience the equally strong urge to subordinate each event and each stage to what man would like to see as a meaningful whole, and to consider the present as the means to some future end. 85</page><page sequence="9">PHYLON Unfortunately, both conceptions are too well grounded to be discarded and too far apart to be easily reconciled. The only "synthesis" we are able to suggest is to retain both views and to recognize their limited value. To us, therefore, history would be a process in which each period is at once episode and epoque. And yet to acknowledge this tragic tension which seems so typical of history is an ordeal almost beyond human endurance. To give further proof for the antagonistic nature of history, it is nec- essary to illuminate the relationship of cultural values. Here too we cannot overlook the fact that so frequently values are contradictory and mutually exclusive. In history as in all other spheres of life the creative process presupposes loss. Growth and achievement depend for their very existence on the destruction and displacement of what has previously been gained. In this sense, progress without a price does not exist. In the realm of spiritual culture a new style, a new pattern, a new form of expression will leave little room for the continued flowering of the old although it may not inhibit the conservation and reproduction of old treasures. Heroic epics are not created in an age of bourgeois novels. Genuine Gothic cathedrals do not spring up on Wall Street. Even in the sphere of material culture where the economic principle of the greatest output with the least possible effort dominates and where gain is measured in quantitative terms, qualitative changes take place which frequently imply losses in value. The "progress" from the horse and buggy to the automobile represents a quantitative increase in speed and power, and yet a loss in geniality and poetry. Likewise the unfolding of creative energy in one sector of human endeavor may very well arrest growth in another: Science is step by step dethroning religion, the lab- oratory atmosphere being no fertile soil for the cultivation of mystics and seers. In fact, there have been historical situations in which no compensa- tion occurred for the losses inflicted. Whole societies and Civilizations have at times disappeared, scarcely leaving a trace of their brilliant existence. Examples in point are the ancient Indus Civilization or the medieval African Negro Kingdoms in the Sudan and south of the Sahara. Great cultural values have vanished under the ruins of the socio-histori- cal catastrophes. What has been preserved until today in our own or other contemporary cultures is but a fraction of the would-be cultural heritage created by all groups in all times. Even those elements that have been transmitted have, in most cases, been profoundly transformed, reinterpreted, and adapted. Frequently they continue to exist as a col- lection of dead relics and curiosities or as unintelligible manuscripts or as books that have lost their meaning. Once more historical development proves itself subject to the inter- play of antagonistic forces. The struggle of man and nature from which 86</page><page sequence="10">HISTORY history springs appears as an erratic, planless, and wasteful process, vascillating between advance and retreat. Each of the two contenders, man and nature, continues to threaten the life of its own product, cul- ture and society, which, in turn, eventually becomes some sort of a threat to itself--no society ever having had complete control over either its environment or its own mechanism. The range and scope of challenges with which any civilized society may be faced is tremendous and only partially determined by its own cultural endowment, whereas the range and type of responses at its disposal is extremely limited, since the latter can only grow out of the specific structure, content, and potentialities of the social system. Under some historical conditions the challenges ex- perienced by a culture group are of such a nature that a successful re- sponse is possible. When Africa was threatened by desiccation, some of its inhabitants responded succcessfully by creating the first great river Civilization in the Nile valley. The Incas and Aztecs, on the other hand, were incapable of meeting the sudden external challenge of superior military power and organization out of their own resources. Only the relatively rare coincidence of numerous favorable circumstances create a condition in which cultural growth and historical evolution are possible. Perhaps for the first time in history, today we are in a position to analyze in scientific terms the social laws of cultural evolution. As re- gards the past, our new knowledge is capable of uncovering structures, tendencies, trends, and interactions only if it does not try to reason away basic disharmonies and limitations. In facing the future, we possess a somewhat greater freedom of action in that our very understanding of both our possibilities and limitations may become a factor contributing to the development of a successful response in a challenging situation. Once and for all, here too, we should become reconciled to the inescap- able truth that a potentially hostile universe will forever intrude into the realm of human undertakings. From this perspective we must picture history as an endless odyssey of the human species. Travelling about hither and thither, it has landed time and again on unknown shores. It has experienced adventures and lived through adversities of a magnitude that no Homer could ever imagine. Yet unlike Odysseus, humanity will never return home to its Ithaca, nor will it ever be rewarded for its trials and tribulations by a faithful and devoted Penelope. 87</page></plain_text>
