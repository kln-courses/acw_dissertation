Discovery of a set of 1965 photo graphs of the Zephyr Creek rock art site, in southwestern Alberta, calls for reconsidera tion and reinterpretation of the site. Com parison of the early photographs with others dating to the past four decades establishes that rock art was made as recently as the mid-twentieth century, and that these images have eroded extremely rapidly. The former fact supports the argument that many of the images were made by local Stoney people who reside a few kilometres away and who were known historically to have been aware of the site. The latter fact is explained by speculation that the images were made with a pigment composed of local, iron-rich clay rather than traditional red ochre. Some of the images at Zephyr Creek may be depic tions of structures associated with sundance ceremonies held by local Stoney. Historic records of rock art at the site from the early 1900s likely pertain to pictographs that are no longer visible. On-going use of a rock art site in the past century is a rare occurrence, and indicates continuation of ceremonial activity at a known site by a known group. Résumé. La découverte d'un ensemble de photographies, datant de 1965, du site d'art rupestre de Zephyr Creek, au sud-ouest de l'Alberta, nous oblige à reconsidérer et réinterpréter ce site. La comparaison des plus anciennes photographies avec celles qui remontent à quatre décennies atteste que l'art rupestre a été pratiqué jusqu'à une période aussi récente que le milieu du vingtième siècle, et que ces images se sont érodées avec une extrême rapidité. Le pre mier de ces faits corrobore l'argument selon lequel nombre de ces images ont été réalisées par les Stoney, population locale résidant à quelques kilomètres, dont on sait par des documents historiques qu'ils connaissaient l'existence du site. Le second fait s'explique par l'hypothèse que ces images étaient réali sées au moyen d'un pigment composé d'une argile locale riche en fer plutôt qu'avec le traditionnel ocre rouge. Certaines des images de Zephyr Creek pourraient être des repré sentations de structures associées aux céré monies de la danse du soleil pratiquées par les Stoney locaux. Les enregistrements histo riques remontant au début des années 1900, qui attestent de l'existence d'art rupestre sur ce site, représentent probablement des picto graphes qui ne sont plus visibles aujourd'hui. Il est rare de découvrir un site d'art rupestre en activité continue au cours du dernier siècle, et cette découverte est l'indice d'une perpétuation d'activités cérémonielles dans un site connu par un groupe connu. The Zephyr Creek rock art site (EcPp-1), in southwestern Alberta, has been known and written about for many decades. The first professional paper written about Alberta rock art (Leechman et al. 1955) makes consider able mention of the site. Noted Cana dian rock art recorder Selwyn Dewdney visited the site in 1960 and sketched the only panels known at that time. The site was briefly noted by Wormington and f Royal Alberta Museum, 12845 102 Avenue NW, Edmonton, AB T5N 0M6 [jack.brink@gov.ab.ca] w J u H C¿ &lt; Canadian Journal of Archaeology/Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 35: 193-231 (2011)</page><page sequence="2">194 • BRINK Forbis (1965), again by Habgood (1968), and by Keyser and Klassen (2001 ). At the request of the Archaeological Survey of Alberta, James D. Keyser visited the site in 1976 and wrote the first paper specifi cally devoted to Zephyr Creek (Keyser 1978). In 1979 I was contacted by John Wiigs of Turner Valley, Alberta, regard ing additional, previously unreported pictographs at Zephyr Creek. This led to a site inspection that same year, photog raphy of new rock art, and publication of an expanded description of the site (Brink 1980). The recent discovery of a set of 35 mm photographic slides taken by John Wiigs in 1965 necessitates a réévaluation of the Zephyr Creek site. Wiigs sent me the slides sometime after I wrote my 1980 article on Zephyr Creek but I had not examined them closely until 2010. The 1965 photographs show a number of rock art images with an astonishingly freshly painted look to them. This is especially true of the images that I first reported in my 1980 article. Furthermore, many of the fresh-looking pictograph panels photographed by Wiigs in 1965 are now extremely eroded such that some are nearly invisible. Evidence that extremely recent pictographs existed at Zephyr Creek in the mid 1960s, and that they have nearly vanished in four and a half decades, changes our understanding of the site and forces reconsideration of the following issues: how old is the rock art?; why is it weathering so rapidly?; what do the images represent?; and who made the pictographs? Fortunately, rock art at Zephyr Creek had been photographed fairly continuously in the past half cen tury allowing for a time-transgressive examination of what has been happen ing at the site. In this paper, using an array of photographs taken over more than four decades, I present a detailed look at each pictograph panel and then address the four issues noted above. The Site Zephyr Creek is a remote site located in the front ranges of the Rocky Mountains of southwestern Alberta, about 32 km southwest of the town of Longview (Figure 1). It is a mountainous set ting of deep, forested valleys and high, rugged bedrock peaks. Zephyr Creek is a north-flowing tributary to the Highwood River that runs along the west side of a north-south trending bedrock ridge. About 3 km south of the confluence of Zephyr and the Highwood there is a gap in this mountain ridge that opens up to a narrow, sinuous pass heading east. Although Zephyr continues flowing south past this gap, there is a small, short stream that flows west out of the gap and joins Zephyr. The stream is unnamed but has locally been called Painted Creek; the name no doubt referring to the pictographs found near its banks. At the place where Painted Creek flows through this gap the mountain ridge on the north side angles down to the creek bottom where it is fractured, undercut and forms a slightly sheltered overhang (Figure 2). It is in this partially sheltered overhang where rock art images have long been known and reported by other research ers (Dewdney 1960; Habgood 1968; Keyser 1978; Leechman et al. 1955). All rock art at Zephyr Creek are red picto graphs painted on dolomite bedrock. Originally Recorded Rock Art The originally reported pictographs at Zephyr Creek, under the bedrock over hang (Figure 2), today consist of two panels situated a few metres apart. In the past there was more rock art at this loca tion.

The pictograph has been damaged, appar ently by someone striking a blow to the bedrock in attempt to remove it. Present is the upper half of the body, neck, head and one full wing. The head is animalis tic, the wing has a thick, downward-curv ing central line that is "feathered". The other panel consists of a human figure and a large-bodied animal placed next to each other (Figure 4). The human has a thin, stick body, feet clearly drawn and pointed towards the animal, a solid red circle for a head, arms bent at the elbows and hands raised with three fingers on each hand splayed out. The animal is not especially diagnostic; made of simple red lines with an ovate body lacking internal features, four legs with no hooves, a long erect tail with a downward hook at the end, a pronounced snout, and two straight-up ears or horns above the head. This may be a representation of a bison although there is no indication of a hump on the back, or it could be a cow (more on this later). There was a third pictograph panel located a few metres above the two just discussed. This panel was present in 1960 when Dewdney sketched the site but fell just before Key Figure 3.

However, the panel is among those photographed in 1965 by Wiigs and therefore is discussed further below. Figures 3 and 4 illustrate changes to these two pictograph panels over a 44 year period1. Most apparent, the red pigment is noticeably brighter, more vibrant in the earlier images (Figures 3A and 4A). The 1965 photographs show a deeper, darker red; the 2009 photo graphs show a more orange-red that has clearly faded in hue over 44 years (Fig ures 3B and 4B). The thunderbird image shows a general fading of the brightness of red pigment over time, though not dramatically so. Figure 4 shows some change in addition to pigment fading, including a light-coloured mineral wash streaked over the middle back of the animal, and some bleeding of red from the tail to the rock directly below. These changes, however, are not dramatic and a general fading of red pigment over time is to be expected at all pictograph sites. These two pictograph panels differ in several respects from all others dis cussed below. First, the images at the lowest, valley bottom level of Zephyr Creek are partially sheltered from direct, continuous exposure to the elements. Both panels are tucked under a slight overhang, affording some protection from wind, rain, direct sunlight, snow accumulation and so forth. Second, the content and style of the two lower panels is perceived as unlike that of the rest of the site. Additionally, the pigment used for the images in Figures 3 and 4 may be different than was used for the other pictographs. These two panels may have been made by a different cultural group and be of different age than the remain der of the panels; however, discussion of these issues is reserved until the other rock art at Zephyr Creek has been pre sented. The 1965 Photographs The most important photographs from the 1965 Wiigs collection are those of pictographs located on the upper bed rock ridge, well above the two panels situated under the overhang. These pictographs were the basis of my 1980 article. Fortunately, these have been photographed a number of times by myself and other colleagues. The fol lowing discussion focuses on panels for which I have a series of dated photo graphs, especially the 1965 images from John Wiigs. It is the comparison between these early photographs and those from decades later that show dramatic and intriguing changes happening at the Zephyr Creek site. In the following I refer to panel numbers assigned in my 1980 paper. These are arbitrary divisions of clusters of images at different loca tions on the bedrock. Panel 1 was the lowest of the panels that I recorded in 1979 on the upper bedrock ridge. Located about 40 m above ground level, it faces upward and is nearly on the crest of the ridge but just slightly off to the east side. Figure 5 illustrates a single composition consist ing of a horizontal human stick figure with arms raised and legs off-kilter from the body, three objects below the body believed to be a bow and arrow, and standing to the right over the human is a large zoomorph which, based on the hump over the shoulder, is likely a bison. Below the bison on a vertical orientation is a small quadruped with a long body, short legs, short erect tail, and a wide open mouth. This is believed to be a dog.

The fine lines of pigment suggest use of a brush; note for example the multiple short strokes used to make the back, belly and legs of the bison. There is some evidence of weath ering in Figure 5A, seen on the shaft of the arrow and the belly and front leg of the dog. Overall, however, the picto graph has a remarkable freshness to it that suggests very recent origin. When next photographed 14 years later (Figure 5B) the deep, vibrant, rich red has faded to a much lighter orange colour. All the elements of the composi tion are still visible, but the appearance has completely lost the quality of a fresh, recent painting. When I recorded the image in 1979 it looked very much like other red ochre pictographs in Alberta; that is, a faded, weathered reddish orange image that would be completely in keeping with traditional rock art of some antiquity. In the absence of the 1965 photo there was no indication that the pictograph was of especially recent age or was undergoing rapid fading. With the passing of another 12 years (Figure 5C) the image continues its pro nounced fading. Some elements of the composition are now hard to recognize. The dog is especially faint. Parts of the arrow and legs of the stick figure are likewise very faint. Most noticeably, some lines that had once been red or orange have taken on a gray hue, like a ghost image of where red pigment was once placed; see especially the back, hind end and belly of the bison. It appears as if Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="8">200 • BRINK the red pigment has washed or eroded away and what remains is a staining of the bedrock where the paint once existed. Finally, a photograph from 1993 (Figure 5D), just two years after the previous, indicates that fading of the pictograph continues at a significant rate. The human figure and bow and arrow are noticeably more faint. The dog is nearly invisible save for a very faint trace of the red line of the back and speck of red at the top of the snout. The bison is still visible, but even more than before appears as simply a dark gray stain on the lighter coloured bed rock; faint red-orange pigment around the head and front legs of the animal in 1991 has nearly disappeared in 1993. A group of archaeologists visiting the site in 2009 did not photograph this panel, suggesting that 16 years after the 1993 photograph the pictograph may have been nearly invisible.

It has seven short vertical lines connected across the top by a horizontal line that curves down ward at both edges. The central vertical line continues above the horizontal line and has two chevron-style flags or points near the top. Below this is a thick crescent of red pigment with the curve upward. Below that is another geometric consisting of six vertical lines connected by an upper horizontal line. This bears some similarity to the top geometric but lacks the upper central line with chevron points on top.

The animal is dog-like, with an outline body, four short legs, a long tail, and a pointed head with a single ear. This pre sumably represents a human holding a spear with a dog alongside. The appearance of the pigment in Figure 6A is like that of Figure 5A; that is, absolutely fresh and vibrant with a deep, dark red colour. It looks to have been painted not long before the photo was taken. Noteworthy is that both the two extremely fresh looking panels (Fig ures 5A and 6A) contain repeated motifs of human stick figures made with a few separate strokes of a brush, armed with weapons (bow and arrow, spear), and with a dog standing close by. I have located only one other photo graph of this panel (Figure 6B). I took the picture on a visit to the site in 1982. It shows only five of the original six verti cal lines of the upper geometric and the crescent below. The horizontal line of the geometric is not discernable, nor is the top centre line with the two pointed flags. Pigment on all of the vertical lines and the crescent has faded considerably in the 17 years between photographs. Notably, the second geometric located between the two cracks in the bedrock, which should be visible in the lower left corner of my 1982 photo, is completely invisible. The framing of my 1982 photograph, centred on the upper geometric and crescent, implies that I did not see any evidence of the human and dog figures below or I would certainly have photo Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="10">202 • BRINK graphed them. Some parts of this picto graph must have been visible during my earlier 1979 inspection of the site but I apparently did not see it. Nor it seems did others who visited the site after 1982, as there are no other photos of which I am aware. I suspect that there may be little or nothing left of this pictograph. It appears that this image was made sometime shortly before 1965 and within a few decades has nearly or completely disappeared. Figure 7 illustrates changes over a 28 year period to another set of images at panel 1, located within a few metres of the images seen in Figure 5. This is an up-facing panel near the ridge crest but tipped slightly to the east. The panel is fully exposed except at the top where there is a small ledge of rock that would provide some shade late in the day to some of the uppermost parts of the panel. The images at this part of panel 1 consist of three geometric figures. There is a thick, upward-curving, red crescent, nearly identical to the one shown in Figure 6. To the left of this is a motif of three vertical lines connected across the top by a horizontal line with a down ward curve at each end. This bears some similarity to the two geometries shown in Figure 6. Below this is a thick red circle with internal designs. Two equally spaced vertical lines divide the circle in three sections; there is a small, thick circle in the middle, and two diagonal lines mark an X across the inside of the circle. The internal vertical stripes, the X mark, and the small central circle were more hastily applied with less pigment leaving a scatter of visible bedrock. When first photographed in 1965 (Figure 7A) the pictograph is bright, vibrant and a deep red in colour. The thickest lines of pigment—on the crescent, the top horizontal line of the rake-like geometric, and the outer large circle—appear very fresh, similar to the 1965 examples seen in Figures 5 and 6. By 1979 (Figure 7B) the red has faded considerably. The large circle in particu lar has lost much of its red colour and become more of a gray stain with a hint of red. The internal X mark, faint to begin with, is nearly invisible. The upper part of the crescent and most of the rake like feature have retained an orange-red hue. The 1991 photograph (Figure 7C) did not include the crescent. The circle is noticeably fainter. The outer ring is seen as mostly a dark stain on the rock, and the internal designs are extremely faint. The upper geometric has more red pigment remaining on this image than on the circle. A photograph of the full panel two years later (Figure 7D) does not show much change in the circle, but allows a view of the upper two geomet ries. The upper part of the crescent is visible as a streak of red, the lower por tion is no longer visible. The rake-like geometric likewise retains some red pigment, especially on the horizontal line. Note that the left side of this line, closest to the small ledge of bedrock that partially shades the uppermost portions of the panel, is most vivid in 1993, as is the most visible part of the crescent. In the span of less than three decades the images at this panel have transformed from vivid, bright red pictographs to severely faded motifs that mostly lack red pigment except in a few upper places where partial shading may have slowed erosional processes. Figure 8 presents another striking example of change through time at Zephyr Creek. Motifs at this panel are part of what I initially called panel 3 although I did not illustrate any figures in my article (Brink 1980).

Compared to the previously discussed 1965 photographs (Figures 5A, 6A, and 7A), most notable about the rock art remained on the rock (Figure 8C). The images were still apparent, in part, by a darker staining of the rock surface. This process was essentially complete by 2009 where the visibility of the image was based almost entirely on the staining of the rock face (Figure 8D).

In the span of 44 years this pictograph has nearly disappeared. Figure 9 shows a geometric design that is part of panel 3 located a few metres away from the images seen in Figure 8. It is on the east side of the ridge, fully exposed, on a sloping surface of bedrock that is rough in surface tex ture. There are three concentric circles with a dot of pigment in the centre. In 1965 (Figure 9A) the colour of the pig ment is a bright and deep red, although coverage on the rock surface is quite discontinuous. This is quite similar to the scattered coverage of pigment seen in Figure 8A and may relate in part to the difficulty of applying solid lines of pigment to rough surfaces. It may also relate to the age of the images; given the close proximity of the pictographs in Fig ures 8 and 9, the similar characteristics of red pigment in each, and the same discontinuous application on a rough surface, it is suggested these two images were painted at about the same time. By 1979 the concentric circles had weathered substantially (Figure 9B). Only a small amount of red pigment is visible on portions of the circles, espe cially in the few places where the earlier photo shows thicker splotches of red. The bottoms of the circles were most faded, the centre dot was still visible. By 1991 (Figure 9C) nearly all of the red was gone, and the image was seen pri manly as a dark stain on the rock with a silver glazed look to what had been red in 1979. By 2009 this transformation was complete (Figure 9D). The image Figure g. Pictographs at panel 3: (A) 1965 photograph (J. Wiigs, photographer); (B) 1979 photograph (J.

This is very similar to the situation with the other pictograph a few metres away at panel 3 (Figure 8D) and lends further support to the argument they were made at about the same time. There is one other pictograph at Zephyr Creek that was recorded in 1965 and for which subsequent photographs exist. Figure 10 shows several images at panel 2, located about 10 m upslope from panel 1 and 15 m downslope from panel 4. The pictographs at this location are fully exposed and near the crest of the ridge but are placed on a rock sur face that has an east-facing orientation and would be shaded late in the day. There are three images at panel 2, one zoomorph and two geometries. The zoo morph at the top is quite clearly a depic tion of a fish. This is the only definite pictograph of a fish known in Alberta. There is a pointed nose, a sideways V for a gill, dorsal and ventral fins, a long thick body that takes a downward bend just before the tail, and a tail that expands to two points and is notched at the end. There is even a tiny dot of red pigment for an eye at the correct anatomical location, and another tiny dot in the centre of the body between the two fins. Below this is a geometric in the shape of a rhomboid. The upper right corner of the interior is cut with a diagonal line, the top horizontal line extends beyond the intersection with the vertical line to the right side, and the bottom line to the left side. Immediately below this is a set of two roughly parallel, wavy lines set a few centimetres apart with five large red Figure io. Pictographs at panel 2: (A) 1965 photograph (J.

The thin hnes of this panel indicate they were painted with a brush. In the 1965 photograph of this panel (Figure 10A) the fish zoomorph appears slightly more weathered than the geometries, the latter being a darker, deeper red and lacking obvious signs of weathering. The back half of the fish is a fainter red, as are the ventral fin and gill. These differences may indicate that the fish was painted a short time before the lower geometries; however, the panel may have been painted at one time (as seems likely given the proxim ity of the three images) with apparent differential pigment strength reflecting where paint was applied more thickly. Overall, the appearance of this panel lacks the ultra-fresh look of the picto graphs seen in Figures 5 and 6, but looks fresher than images in Figures 8 and 9, and it may be intermediate in terms of date of execution. When photographed 14 years later all elements of panel 2 are still visible (Figure 10B). Only the back end and tail of the fish are difficult to discern. Once again the pigment colour has faded from a deep red to a dustier orange-red. The middle rhomboid geometric appears slightly more faded than the bottom wavy geometric. Overall, the degree of fading of the pictograph in 14 years is similar to that seen at panel 1 (Figure 7). The 1993 photograph (Figure IOC) was taken from an angle and with light that accentuated the surface of the bedrock making it difficult to see the pigment. However, the two geometries are vis ible but clearly faded from the 1979 photo. The bottom and right side of the rhomboid are most faint, the lower wavy geometric is most distinct. The fish is difficult to discern due to bedrock texture, but colour enhancement shows that the pigment is still present for most of the body except for the lower back line and the tail. By the time of a 2009 visit to the site the only part of the panel that remained visible was the bottom geometric and a small portion of the rhomboid, and this is what was photo graphed (Figure 10D) (Terry Quinn, personal communication 2010). Parts of the two parallel wavy lines are visible, though gaps exist where pigment is com pletely missing. The three red dots at the upper right of the geometric can barely be discerned, and the other two dots are nearly invisible. Only the right side of the rhomboid was included in the pho tograph, as the rest of the image was not seen. The only portion of the rhomboid visible is the upper horizontal line that extends beyond the quadrilateral sides. The Fallen Pictographs John Wiigs photographed one addi tional rock art panel at Zephyr Creek in 1965 (Figure 11) but this panel col lapsed in 1975. The images seen in Figure 11 were part of a larger complex of motifs locatedjust above the sheltered overhang at the bottom of the bedrock ridge where the originally recorded pic tographs (Figures 3 and 4) are located (John Wiigs, personal communication 2011). As such, the panel would have been south-facing and placed on a downward-plunging sheet of bedrock. This entire area was sketched by Selwyn Dewdney in 1960 (Dewdney 1960). His sketch shows the same motifs seen in the 1965 Wiigs' photograph plus a group of parallel vertical lines ("tally marks" or finger swipes) that are about one to two metres higher than the area captured in Wiigs' photograph, and at least one more curved arc that seems to be about three metres above ground level (Dewd ney 1960).

Wiigs, photographer); (B) DStretch enhancement of 1965 photograph. No scale. This panel collapsed prior to site visits by Keyser in 1976 and me in 1979. Keyser was provided with a photograph of the panel (similar to Figure 11 but not taken by Wiigs) and working from this he sketched part of the panel (Keyser 1978:Figure 55c and d). Keyser's descrip tion of the panel agrees with Figure 11 except that he describes two occurrences of tally marks, one of which is the group seen in the centre of Figure 11, the other is said to be above the geometric abstracts at the top of this photograph (Keyser 1978:101) and are almost cer tainly the higher parallel lines sketched by Dewdney. In our respective articles both Keyser and I noted the presence of rock rubble on the creek valley floor with traces of red pigment, presumably from this collapsed panel. Although there is no subsequent photo-documentation to assess weath ering rates, this panel is important for several reasons. First, it provides more evidence of relatively recent rock art imagery at Zephyr Creek, and second the specific motifs at the panel are rel evant to interpretations of the rock art. The 19Ö5 photograph showed tour separate images (Figure 11 ). At the top right is an unusual face-like motif with two red dots placed on either side of a thick vertical line, like eyes and nose. Below this is a group of hatched hori zontal lines that could be interpreted as a mouth or a moustache. 1 here is noth ing else similar to this image at Zephyr Creek. Below and left of this is a geo metric that is a more stylized version of a common motif at the site. A group of five vertical lines, the outer two strongly curved, are connected across the top by a horizontal line that also curves upward at the edges. The outer two curved verti cal lines continue upward connecting with a loop that encircles a projecting single vertical line with a pointed tip formed by two diagonal lines.

Below this is a set of six vertical lines (Keyser's [1978] tally marks). It may be noteworthy that the top of the lines all originate just below a natural crack in the rock, even following the curvature of this crack from left to right. This seems purposeful, and could represent an intentional incorporation of the break in the rock into the arrangement of the motif. This is reminiscent of the central geometric in Figure 6A where six verti cal lines seem to be placed in relation to a bedrock crack. Finally, this panel has a thick red arc, with the curve upward. This is very similar to the arcs seen in Figures 6 and 7, both curved upward, and both found in association with the geometries described above. Dewdney (1960) also sketched at least one addi tional up-turned arc near Figure 11; presumably now collapsed. All of the lines in the motifs in Figure 11 are thick, suggesting painting by finger rather than brush, and all show considerable down ward running, or "bleeding" of pigment. Post 1965 Photographs There is rock art at Zephyr Creek that was not photographed by John Wiigs in 1965. Not all are relevant to the present study, but several relate to either the issue of erosion and age of pictographs, or the interpretation and meaning of the images and are discussed below. Figure 12 shows a scene from what I called panel 4; an up-facing, fully exposed panel that tips slightly east and is located about 10 m upslope from Figure 12. Rock art at panel 4, Zephyr Creek: (A) 1979 photograph (J. Brink, photogra pher); (B) DStretch enhancement of 1979 photograph; (C) 1991 photograph (J. Dormaar, photographer); (D) 1993 photograph (M. Klassen, photographer). Centre animal is about 15 cm across. Journal Canadien d Archeologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="18">210 • BRINK panel 2. To my knowledge the earliest photograph of this is mine from 1979 (Figure 12A). At the time I identified this as a hunting scene with two antlered animals, a human stick figure possibly holding a spear, an indistinct circular painting above the animals, and addi tional indistinct red pigment below (Brink 1980). I originally suggested the animals were elk or caribou; I now think deer is equally likely. Enhanced imaging (Figure 12B) confirms these compo nents and suggests that the image below is likely another dog and the one above is a circular design with two internal verti cal lines and an X mark quite similar to the designed circle seen in Figure 7, only on a smaller scale. There may even be a small red dot in the centre of the circle at panel 4, like that in Figure 7A. The dog at the bottom of the panel, if that is what it is, looks very similar in body form and size to the one seen in Figure 6, which is also in the company of a human. The fine lines of these images, including depiction of individual antler tines, sug gest they were painted with a brush. The 1979 photograph shows these fig ures as clearly weathered, though the two zoomorphs are still distinct. The human figure is on a part of bedrock with calcite deposition and the right side of the leg, arm, and spear are mostly obscure. The legs of the central zoomorph have been partially removed by erosion, as have a few spots of body lines. The left zoo morph is the most intact. The colour of the pigment is a dusty orange-red, much like the 1979 images seen in Figures 5B and 7B. As it may be assumed that this panel represents a depiction of a single story painted at one time, the faintness of the dog, circle design and spear, along with the duller tone of the pigment, indi cate considerable weathering since the time of original artwork. Panel 4 was rephotographed 12 and 14 years later (Figure 12C and D). In both cases further deterioration of the figures can be seen. The dog, circle design and spear are nearly invisible. The human figure is increasingly indis tinct, and by 1993 can only be seen as a portion of the left leg and a splotch of red where the torso line intersects the arms. This appears to be due to pig ment erosion not calcite deposition. The antlered animals remain most visible though clearly reduced in brightness of pigment. The left zoomorph is still the most discernable, although some fading of all four legs, the belly line, head and anders is apparent. In sum, the panel has faded considerably in just 14 years. Had a 1965 photograph of this panel been available I suspect that it would have had a very fresh look, perhaps much like that of Figure 5. The fact that the panels shown in Figures 5 and 12 both include hunting scenes, with humans, animals, weapons and dogs, and that the appear ance of the pigment in 1979 is similar at both panels, suggests that they may have been painted at about the same time. Panel 5 was also first photographed in 1979 (Figure 13A). I originally noted a distinct sinuous line and several faint red stains to the left of this (Brink 1980). With colour enhancement (Figure 13B) it is now possible to identify the pigment on the left as another geometric very similar to those illustrated in Figures 6, 7, and 8. At panel 5 this feature has six vertical lines connected at the top by a horizontal line with curved ends. There is no upper central vertical line with a pointed top. Between the sinuous line and the geometric are two faint, short, opposing diagonal lines like an inverted V but that do not meet. There is faint evidence that the diagonal line on the left may have extended an additional Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="19">DISAPPEARING DREAMS AT THE ZEPHYR CREEK ROCK ART SITE, ALBERTA • 211 ca. 20 cm down the rock face ending underneath the geometric (Figure 13B).

The verti cal crescent at the top left side of the line is likewise nearly invisible. On the other hand, the top of the sinuous line is still quite apparent in the later photographs. Granted, this was the thickest and dark est part of the line when photographed in 1979. However, given the rapid weath ering seen at other panels at the site, the integrity of the top portion of the line is unusual. The same is true at one additional small panel at Zephyr Creek. At panel 1, the lowest panel on the ridge, in addition to the two pictograph clusters shown in Figures 5 and 7, there is a small group of four short wavy lines of red pigment (Figure 14). These are located on an up facing piece of bedrock, tipped slightly to the east and with a ledge of rock just above the panel such that later in the day the figure is in shadow. The lines appear to have been painted by finger, though probably not the four fingers of one hand. When first photographed in 1979 (Figure 14A) the lines are obvious and distinct but not fresh. All four lines show evidence of weathering in the form of loss of pigment, producing a speckled look to the lines where the bedrock shows through. The pigment is a rusty red ochre colour. This contrasts with the Figure 14. Panel 1 at Zephyr Cree: (A) 1979 photograph (J. Brink, photographer); (B) 1991 photograph (J. Dormaar, photographer); (C) 1993 photograph (M.

Photographs from 1991 and 1993 do not show a great deal of change (Figure 14B and C). Although some loss and fading of pigment is noted, the lines are still visible, distinct, and the paint retains a rust-red colour. With the pas sage of another 16 years (Figure 14D) the lines are still visible but show evi dence of progressive weathering. All four lines have faded and lost pigment, in particular the lower portion of the two lines on the right are quite faint, while the upper parts in shadow are more dis tinct. However, this panel is somewhat of an anomaly in that 30 years after the first photographs were taken the wavy lines of Figure 14 retain more red pig ment, albeit faded, than is true of other pictographs on the upper bedrock ridge at Zephyr Creek. A possible reason for this will be presented below. Discussion There are many puzzles at the Zephyr Creek rock art site, not all of which will be resolved in this paper. In discuss ing the data presented above I will first address what seem the most definitive conclusions and then work towards more speculative matters. Four topics will be discussed: 1 ) when was rock art made at Zephyr Creek; 2) why has it weathered so quickly; 3) who made the images; and 4) what are the drawings meant to represent? When Was the Rock Art Made ? The discovery of a series of photographs taken in 1965 of rock art at Zephyr Creek, and the comparison with subse quent photographs, leads to the ines capable conclusion that some rock art images were extremely recent in 1965. This is especially true of images shown in Figures 5, 6, and 7. Pigment in these three instances is a vibrant, deep, blood red, and is solid and continuous where applied to the rock with almost no signs of colour fading or loss of pigment from weathering. There can be no doubt that, as of 1965, these three motifs were extremely recent in age. Of the three, the scene of the human with spear, dog, and several geometries (Figure 6) is per haps the freshest, as there is no sign of any loss or running ("bleeding") of pig ment. In contrast, there is a faint red tint to the rock below the major figures in the scene with the bison, dog, horizontal human with bow and arrow (Figure 5) indicating a slight amount of downward bleeding of pigment. Also, a few red lines in Figure 5 (the dog belly and front leg, the arrow) are discontinuous and suggest some loss of pigment. I suggest that, as of 1965, Figure 6 was the most recent image painted at Zephyr Creek. This figure eroded extremely rapidly, so much so that most subsequent visitors apparently never saw it. In 1982 I saw and photographed two geometries at the upper part of the panel. Even then, portions of the uppermost geometric were completely gone, and a lower geo metric that should have appeared in my photo frame had entirely disappeared (Figure 6B). The human, dog and spear figures must have also vanished or become extremely faint by that time or I would certainly have photographed them. Given the completely fresh look to the pictograph in 19Ö5 1 suggest that the images were no more than a few years old. Figure 5 is considered to be of similarly recent age, but may be a few years older than Figure 6. It too has since weathered dramatically, such that over 28 years of photographic coverage it transformed from a vibrant, stark red image to little more that a dark stain on Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="22">214 • BRINK the rock surface with a few remaining specks of pigment (Figure 5D). It is possible that the pictograph panels seen in Figures 5 and 6 are coeval. In common, the two humans at these panels are very similar, both made from six separate lines: one for each leg, one torso line, two arms and a short stroke for a head. However, there are several notable differences. The human in Figure 6 has small feet drawn at the bottom of each leg, the other human does not. The dogs, if that's what they are, differ considerably. One is oriented vertically, has a long body with a swayed back and belly, a short erect tail, a long neck, and a head consisting mainly of a wide open mouth (Figure 5). The other is horizontally oriented, has a short body with straight lines, a long horizontal tail, a head formed by a simple dark triangle with no mouth and a short nub of an ear (Figure 6). Also note that the points of the weapons differ; the arrow has a solid triangular head, while the spear has an open V-shaped tip. How significant these differences are is unknown, but they seem substantive enough to argue that different artists may have been at work at perhaps slightly different times. The pictograph panel in Figure 7 is also reckoned to be of very recent creation. The 1965 photograph shows a bright red design with very fresh marks where fingers dipped in pigment were drawn across the rock. The crescent, the large outer circle and the top line of the rake-like geometric are especially thick and rich with pigment. The internal designs of the large circle and the verti cal lines of the geometric are notably less prominent but this appears to be a result of a hasty and thin application of pigment to these areas and not weath ering (Figure 7A). Weathering of this image from 1965 to 1993 (Figure 7A-D) is extensive though not as dramatic as the two pictographs discussed above. By 1993 the geometries have all severely faded but can still be discerned, at least in part, as red images on the rock and not just as darkened bedrock that has been discoloured by paint. Clearly, this is a recently painted image, again likely originating only a few years prior to 1965. The unnumbered panel (Figure 11) that fell before Keyser or I saw the site is considered to be slightly older, as of 1965, than the three panels discussed above. While the panel is decidedly fresh looking, it lacks the rich, vibrant hue of the other extremely recent panels. The rock below these images shows considerable running of red pigment (Figure IIB) not seen in the images considered to be more recent. I suggest that the unnumbered panel was painted before the art in Figures 5, 6, and 7, although not very many years before. Next in the 1965 photographic record there are several panels that lack the very fresh look of those discussed above but which still look recent in comparison with later documentation. This includes the pictographs seen in Figures 8, 9, and 10. All of these panels share an indication of some weathering when photographed in 1965. Over time pigment has faded and become spottier in coverage, more scattered in appear anee. Erosion of specks of red pigment has caused the bedrock to become vis ible in and around the paint. The three panels are roughly similar in this regard, although, subjectively, the concentric circles of Figure 9 may be slightly more advanced in weathering than the other two, and the fish and geometric designs (Figure 10) seem slightly less weathered than the other two panels. In general it can be concluded that these three panels Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011 )</page><page sequence="23">DISAPPEARING DREAMS AT THE ZEPHYR CREEK ROCK ART SITE, ALBERTA • 215 were not as recent looking in 1965 as others at the site and thus should be somewhat older, although (based on perceived erosion rates at the site) not likely more than a decade or so. All three panels were last photographed in 2009 at which time two (Figures 8 and 9) had lost virtually all red pigment and existed only as dark stains on bedrock, while the third (Figure 10) retained a faint bit of red colour in the lower geometric. The panels in Figures 12, 13, and 14 were apparently first photographed in 1979. Although there is less evidence to posit the weathering rates and relative age of these images, it is possible to con sider the 1979 photographs with regard to other panels that were photographed in both 1965 and 1979. Specifically, the nature of the pigment in 1979 in Fig ures 12A and 13A, a dull orange-red, is quite similar to the pigment appearance in the 1979 photographs in Figures 5B (the buffalo hunt) and 10B (the fish and geometries). This suggests that had Figures 12 and 13 been photographed in 1965 they would have appeared quite similar to the earlier record of the buf falo hunt and the fish (Figures 5A and 10A). I suggest that Figures 12A and 13A are also of quite recent age, painted perhaps around the middle of the twen tieth century. As noted earlier, Figure 14 seems to differ from other panels located on the upper part of the bedrock ridge in that the pigment appears darker in colour and less eroded from the surface than any of the other pictographs. Over 30 years of photo documentation, this panel has survived better than all others on the bedrock ridge. Why this might be so is addressed in a subsequent section. Historie records of the Zephyr Creek site also yield relevant, though indirect, information on when some of the images were made. The publications by Leech man et al. (1955) and Barbeau (1960) contain historic comments about the site, revealing two important trends: first, there are several references to the pictographs at Zephyr Creek always changing; and second, there are mul tiple references to specific motifs that are not visible today nor were they visible to Wiigs in 1965 or me in 1979. Barbeau conducted interviews with a number of Stoney (Assiniboine) people of southwestern Alberta in the early 1920s including Daniel Wildman, a Stony living at the Morley reserve west of Calgary. Wildman was familiar with the Zephyr Creek site, describing it as, "From the place where the High-Wood River comes, between four and six miles south on the flat rock, the creek faces south" (Barbeau 1960:208). Although the distance of four to six miles is exces sive, the description fits closely the Zephyr Creek location, and the locally named Painted Creek trends east-west as it passes the site so could be said to face south. Wildman offered this account of changing images at Zephyr Creek: The next time you go there, the paint is all changed. It is a house with a bell on top, a man walking and a leg2 walking behind, and the full moon on. Next time all the paint is changed again, and some body is shooting all the mountain animals: goats, sheep, bears, and jumping deer. Another time it is a picture of the moose [Barbeau 1960:208]. While it is not uncommon for Native informants to comment on the changing nature of rock art (Barbeau 1960:210; Dempsey 1973:25), there may be a special importance to these com ments at Zephyr Creek. Since the 1965 Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="24">216 • BRINK photographs demonstrate that rock art has been produced in recent years, and clearly this art has weathered very rap idly, historic period comments regarding changing images at the site may be due to the ongoing practice of making new images in the twentieth century. That is, repeatedly making new art, which then erodes to nearly invisible in a matter of decades, would present visitors with a series of ever changing images. In addition, historic accounts make note of pictographs high up on the bed rock ridge at Zephyr Creek, and suggest that there is a progression of upward movement over time. In the same inter view Wildman states: But the picture is placed very high on the rock. No human being is able to reach up there. These pictures are still right up there to-day ...A year ago last summer [circa 1922], I went to see the rock. These pictures had moved up higher for the third time, I know. Now they are just more than half way from the top of the mountain. But quite distinct...The lines are about the size of finger marks... It is not the work of human beings. In the early days, they used to be only ten feet high, or a little bit higher. I don't know who made these pictures there. They have been known for generations [Barbeau 1960:208], This statement has several implica tions for the timing of rock art produc tion at Zephyr Creek. Clearly some rock art existed at the site in the early 1920s. I suggest that this was not likely to be any or all of the pictographs I have discussed from the upper bedrock ridge. Some of these were likely only painted a few years before 1965, others shortly before that. The rapid rate of erosion evident at the site suggests that few if any of the pic tographs recorded in 1965 would have been present some 43 years earlier when Wildman said he viewed the site. A likely exception is the rock art located under the overhang near ground level (Fig ures 3 and 4) where photo-documen tation over four decades shows a much slower rate of weathering. Assuming they were made prior to 1922, these motifs should have been present when Wild man visited the site. Wildman's com ment that "in the early days" the images used to be only 10 feet or a bit higher off the ground may correspond with the pictographs situated under the overhang plus the fallen panel (Figure 11) known to be about that high above ground surface when sketched in 1960 by Dewd ney. Wildman may have seen this panel, or, assuming that the fallen panel may also be too recent to have been present in 1922 (based on it's relatively fresh appearance in 1965), other pictographs placed in this same location but that had faded into obscurity. Note also that Wildman is of the opinion that rock art started off low to the ground surface and moved up the mountain ridge over time. This is consistent with the argument I present below that the upper ridge images are relatively recent and executed with an expedient and rapidly perishable form of red pigment, while the lowest picto graphs are older and were executed with a more conventional form of red ochre. However, Wildman's statement provides strong substance to the fact that as early as the 1920s rock art was located in sev eral places on the higher bedrock ridge well above the lowest pictographs under the overhang. This highly significant fact means that although the 1965 pho Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="25">DISAPPEARING DREAMS AT THE ZEPHYR CREEK ROCK ART SITE, ALBERTA • 217 tographic record shows clear evidence of the creation of very recent rock art, the practice of making new images on the bedrock ridge was by that date already at least four decades old. And it seems inescapable that few if any of the images Wildman observed on the ridge in the early 1920s are the same as those photographed in 1965; rates of weather ing seen in the photographs I have pre sented are simply too extreme to accept that the same pictographs were visible some four and a half decades later. This means that the images at Zephyr Creek are in fact always changing, and that people have continued making new rock art at the site. Why Has the Rock Art Weathered so Rapidly ? Along with the fact that many of the images at Zephyr Creek were made very recently, the other undeniable fact is that most of the images have weathered at an extremely rapid rate. This is seen repeatedly in the photographs presented above, especially in Figures 5-10. Over the past four and a half decades some pictographs have transformed from bril liantly fresh to nearly invisible. Why is this happening at Zephyr Creek when, from decades of personal experience, no similar situations have been observed at other pictograph sites, at least in Alberta? Certainly an important factor is that most of the images at Zephyr Creek are situated on an up-facing bedrock ridge. Most are fully exposed to the elements; the intensity of sun, wind, rain, snow, freeze/thaw, and particle abrasion. There is little variability in this regard; that is, none of the panels on the ridge top have a particular advantage in terms of shelter or protection. Only panel 3 pictographs (Figures 8 and 9) are not on or near the crest of the ridge; they are on the east-facing side but are still essentially fully exposed. There is some micro-vari ability in surface topography at individual panels, where a small portion of an image is located near a rock ledge that provides a bit of shade at certain times of the day (see Figures 7C and 14B-D). This could be a slight factor in helping to maintain the integrity of small areas of pigment. Overall, however, the images on the ridge are equally exposed to the elements. Likewise, the porosity of the bedrock should not differ significantly from one location on the ridge to another. The increasing acidity of rain that characterized mid-twentieth century climate would be expected to affect exposed rock art images. And while this has likely been a factor at Zephyr Creek, other red ochre pictographs in Alberta are likewise fully exposed to the processes of weathering and do not seem to be suffering the same fate. For example, over several decades I have repeatedly photographed a pictograph on an exposed, south-facing sandstone bedrock wall at Writing-on-Stone (an intensely sunny locale) and have seen little change in the brightness and vibrancy of the red pigment (see Brink 2007:Figure 5). The fact that Zephyr Creek pictographs are painted on a dolo mite substrate could be a factor, in that this bedrock might be more affected by acid rain than others such as sandstone. But other pictograph sites exist in the Alberta Rocky Mountains (see Klassen 200B) and these do not seem to be suf fering the same fate. Although the fully exposed aspect of the Zephyr Creek pic tographs is certainly related to the rate of weathering, the nature of the pigment used may be a prime factor. Examining the two freshest looking images (Figures 5 and 6), the pigment is a very deep, dark shade of red, unlike other red ochre rock art images I have Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="26">218 • BRINK seen. Other panels may have previously had this same deep red appearance prior to fading. It seems this may not be red ochre in the traditional sense of a com bination of hematite and some kind of binding agent such as animal fat. Given the clearly recent age of many images it is possible that commercial paint was used. It may be possible to determine this. The use of portable x-ray fluorescence equipment has been shown to assist in documenting the addition of modern paint to existing pictographs (Newman and Loendorf 2005). Future research should consider use of this equipment at Zephyr Creek; however, it is question able whether or not sufficient pigment remains on any of the upper ridge images to obtain a reliable signature. There is evidence, albeit sugges tive, that a non-traditional form of red ochre was used at Zephyr Creek. John Wiigs (personal communication 2011) informed me that the Zephyr Creek area has been explored for deposits of sedimentary iron. He observed backhoe trenches in the area between Zephyr and Cataract Creeks, and was informed that these were made by geologists testing for commercially viable iron deposits. He doesn't know when the trenches were excavated but they were present at the time of his 1965 visit. It appears that the area immediately adjacent to the picto graphs is rich in iron ore. This may have been the source of pig ment at Zephyr Creek. Barbeau's infor mant Daniel Wildman commented on the pigment used at Zephyr Creek, "It is in Spirit-Red clay, nothing else but that" (Barbeau 1960:2083). This brief but tan talizing statement could mean that just a simple red earth pigment was used; the "nothing else" reference being an indica tion that no other material was added, such as animal fat, to make a traditional form of red ochre. Wildman would have certainly been familiar with the typical form of red ochre. His comment that nothing else was added seems to be an intentional attempt to distinguish the pigment used at Zephyr Creek from more conventional red ochre. Thus it is possible that locally available iron deposits (either rock or iron-rich clay) were quarried to make red pigment. This may have been treated in some way, such as crushed or heated, then mixed with water and used as a slurry to paint on the rock with no added binding agent. A red iron ore slurry might appear deep red in colour especially if heated (or simply from oxidation), could be applied with a brush or fingers, and would be expected to erode much more quickly than red ochre prepared with a binding agent. Additionally, one would expect this un-fixed slurry to run or bleed more readily, as seen with some of the pictographs at Zephyr Creek. Bleed ing of pigment, such as seen in Figure 11, would not be expected with commercial paint, nor with more traditional forms of red ochre. Although inconclusive, I suggest that the pictographs at Zephyr Creek were made with a simple slurry of water and crushed (possibly heated) iron-rich sediment, obtained very close to the site, unaltered with any additional ingredients, and that this accounts in large part for the extremely rapid weath ering of the rock art images. Perhaps there is a pattern to recent rock art being made in a more expedient fashion. Comparison of historic paintings and copies of rock art in Natal Drakens berg, South Africa, with modern photo graphs shows more rapid deterioration of images made in the "frontier" period of the past two hundred years than of the earlier, pre-contact rock art (Ward 1997; Ward and Maggs 1994). As partial Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="27">DISAPPEARING DREAMS AT THE ZEPHYR CREEK ROCK ART SITE, ALBERTA • 219 explanation, Vinnicombe (1976:141) states that the nineteenth century paint ings were made with pigment that lacked a binding medium thus leading to more rapid deterioration, "It is not uncommon therefore to find the most recent paint îngs appearing less well preserved than the earlier" (Vinnicombe 1976:141). It appears that Vinnicombe's statement regarding the absence of a binding medium is an opinion rather than an analyzed fact, but the accelerated weath ering of the more recent rock art at Natal Drakensberg is well documented (Ward 1997; Ward and Maggs 1994), and remi niscent of the situation at Zephyr Creek. What Do the Images Represent? Interpretation of what some of the images at Zephyr Creek are intended to represent also relates to the issue of the recent production of rock art. Histori cal records of specific motifs said to be present at Zephyr Creek have a bearing on the repeated making of rock art and implications for rates of erosion. These records, and the 1965 photographs, shed new light on the interpretation of specific motifs. In a general sense the content of the pictographs at Zephyr Creek is not unlike many other rock art sites: pres ent are anthropomorphs, zoomorphs, geometries, objects of material culture and simple lines. There are images that clearly depict relations between animals and humans (Figures 4, 5, and 12). Identifiable zoomorphs include a fish (Figure 10), a bird-like creature (Figure 3), a bison (Figure 5), deer or other antlered game animals (Figure 12), and several probable dogs (Fig ures 5, 6, and 12). Material culture is restricted to weapons including bow and arrow, spear, and either a spear or dart (Figures 5, 6, and 12). There are many geometric symbols, several of which are repeated and so must have recognized meaning to the artists (Figures 7-10, 13, and 14). Below I will say a few words about perceived differences in the style of images at Zephyr Creek, but the immediate issue is how the 1965 pho tographs and historical research influ ences interpretation of select motifs, and in turn how this relates to the age and weathering of the pictographs. As noted in my previous article (Brink 1980), there is ample confusion in the historic literature regarding specific motifs that were once said to be present at Zephyr Creek. The confusion stems from the fact that many motifs are men tioned as being present at the site that have no counterpart in photographic documentation over the past decades. This raises two possibilities: either there are other rock art sites near the Zephyr Creek site; or many motifs mentioned in the literature were once present but have simply disappeared. As noted above, Daniel Wildman told Barbeau in the 1920s that images at Zephyr Creek included a house with a bell on top, a man walking, the moon, moose, horizontal lines, and someone shooting animals including goats, sheep, bears and deer. Wildman also stated there were pictures of tipis and of people wearing war bonnets out hunting buffalo (Barbeau 1960:208). Some of these descriptions resonate with our knowledge of Zephyr Creek from 1965 onward, including hunting buffalo (Figure 5A), a man walking with a dog (Figure 6A), and shooting mountain animals (possibly Figure 12). However, at least the first two of these panels were clearly extremely fresh looking in 1965 and were nearly invisible several decades later. I assert that these images could not have existed at Zephyr Creek in the early Journal Canadien d Archeologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="28">220 • BRINK 1920s when Wildman was interviewed. In addition, since 1965 there has been no sign of dpis, of war bonnets, or of goats, sheep, bears or moose. In a similar vein, there are comments about the site from a rancher who lived in southwestern Alberta in the early 1900s and who was clearly familiar with the Zephyr Creek site. Regarding the site location, George Pocaterra wrote the following to Canadian anthropologist Harlan I. Smith: About 12 years ago [i.e., circa 1920] 'Four-birds-fly-away', a Stoney of middle age, showed me, while hunting together, the stone-paint ings on a rock-face where a small creek, tributary from the south of the Highwood, cuts through a range of high hills. This Creek puts into the main river east of Cataract Creek and is called by the Indians: Umpa'h-bin Oa'h-bi Wapta'hn' which means 'the creek of the writings on stone'. The paintings are in the usual red ochre, and the designs are also in the usual crude manner of the Indians. They are on a face of rock sloping slightly inward, facing south, perhaps 15 to 20 feet above ground4 [Leech man etal. 1955:41-42]. From this account it is clear that Pocaterra saw only the lower pictographs in or around the bedrock overhang. Regarding the images he observed at the Zephyr Creek site, Pocaterra stated, "I can remember figures of Indians on horseback, of buffalo hunts, tepees and a rising sun. The presence of horseback fig ures shows that these paintings are not so very old, as it was not long ago that these northern Indians were without horses" (Leechman et al. 1955:42-43; emphasis in original). Again, nothing remotely like horses with riders and tipis has been seen at the site since 1965. The buffalo hunting scene I recorded (Figure 5) is too far up on the bedrock ridge to have been observed by Pocaterra. Further more, this scene cannot be more than a few years old when photographed in 1965 so cannot be the one Pocaterra observed ca. 1920. Noteworthy is that the statements from both Wildman and Pocaterra date to the early 1920s and both mention tipis and buffalo hunts, and Wildman 's reference to "out hunt ing buffalo" could be a reference to Indi ans on horseback (matching Pocaterra's mention of the same). It could be that both were describing the same artwork as observed at about the same time. Also noteworthy is that all buffalo hunting had ended some four decades before these statements were made; so either the observed pictographs were painted as memories of traditional activities, or the images Pocaterra and Wildman described were at least 40 years old in the 1920s. In my earlier article (Brink 1980:14) I speculated that these citations suggest the presence of additional rock art sites in the surrounding region. I now believe that most, if not all, of these accounts pertain to the known rock art site of Zephyr Creek, and that the 'miss ing' motifs not visible as of 1965 have disappeared due to rapid erosion and bedrock collapse. However, one record more convincingly argues for additional rock art locations in the Zephyr Creek region. Roy Fowler was a longtime southern Alberta resident and amateur archaeolo gist. Regarding the Zephyr Creek site he made the intriguing statement, "Other pictures along the same creek show what appears to be a milk cow, so must be of fairly recent origin, say 1880 to 1885" Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="29">DISAPPEARING DREAMS AT THE ZEPHYR CREEK ROCK ART SITE, ALBERTA • 221 (Leechman et al. 1955:41). Problemati cally, we don't know if Fowler was report ing his own observations or those relayed to him by another party. He was almost certainly familiar with the known Zephyr Creek site (he ranched and farmed along the Highwood River and was one of Leechman's coauthors). If the statement is from personal observation then the reference to 'other pictures along the same creek' is firm evidence of other pic tographs along either Zephyr Creek or Painted Creek. If, however, he was report ing information relayed to him, then the sighting could have been at the known Zephyr Creek site. While there has not been an obvious 'milk cow' at the site in recent times, given the demonstrated rapid erosion of images it is possible that one existed in the past (the amorphous large quadruped in Figure 4 could be interpreted as a milk cow but lacks teats, udder, or any other distinctive features). I believe that Fowler was quite familiar with the rock art images at Zephyr Creek and thus was reporting pictographs at some other nearby location. If so, this lends further evidence to the recent making of rock art in the Zephyr Creek area. The fact that no other site has been reported could be due to bedrock collapse or, if pictographs were made with an iron ore slurry as argued above, then they may have disappeared in the decades since Fowler's observations. There is one motif that appears at Zephyr Creek more often than any other and for which I offer a new interpreta tion; one that also has a bearing on the age of rock art at Zephyr Creek. This is the geometric design comprised of a set of parallel, closely-spaced, vertical red lines connected at the top by a single horizontal line, and in some manifesta tions having a single, vertical line extend ing from the centre of the horizontal line with a pointed top formed by two converging diagonal lines. The fullest versions of this motif are seen in Fig ures 6, 8, and 11, with the former having a double pointed upper central line and the latter two having single points at the top. Similar motifs having only the set of vertical lines connected by an upper horizontal line are seen in Figures 6, 7, and 13B. In a number of these motifs the outermost vertical lines have an outward curve to them that forms a rounded shoulder where it connects with the upper horizontal line. There are several repeated associations with these geo metries including humans at two panels (Figures 6 and 8), and thick crescents at three (Figures 6, 7, and 11). Given the frequency of this motif at Zephyr Creek it is reasonable to assume that this repre sents a deliberate depiction of a specifi cally formed, meaningful representation of something of significance to a cultural group. I know of nothing similar to this repetitive motif at other Alberta rock art sites, and see nothing similar to them in the adjacent Columbia Plateau (Keyser 1992). A clue to their meaning may lie in the historic records and in the contem porary use of the site region. The valley of Zephyr Creek near the confluence with the Highwood River is an old and important area for Sundance ceremonies conducted by the Stoney people from the nearby Eden Valley Reserve, and also people from the larger Stoney reserve at Morley west of Calgary. My repeated visits to the site have taken me past stand ing and collapsed remains of Sundance lodges and associated sweatlodges. The activity continues, as documented by Terry Quinn (personal communication 2010) who saw and photographed col lapsed Sundance lodge remains in 2009 (Figure 15).

In the middle of the circle is a taller central pole supported by diagonal side poles. The central pole, in my experi ence, always has offerings tied to it, most commonly strips of coloured cloth. These may be tied around the trunk of the centre pole, but almost always are tied at the top, often in great numbers, where they wave in the wind. For visual refer ence, Figure 16A shows a more complete abandoned sundance lodge that I photo graphed in the Alberta Rocky Mountains; it was built and used by Stoney people but is not located near the Zephyr Creek site. Figure 16B compares one of the geomet ries from the Zephyr Creek site. The simi larity is apparent. The pictograph could be a representation of a sundance lodge, with the horizontal and vertical lines representing the wooden structure and the centre line with pointed tip being the flags of cloth tied as offerings. In another Barbeau interview from the 1920s, George McLean5 spoke of a rock art site located in the Crowsnest Pass of Alberta. Among the images present he noted, "war dances shown on them, sundances, pictures of them... There is also another place on High River where one sees such designs" (Barbeau 1960:210). Quite likely "High River" refers to the Highwood River. Although tangential, the sugges tion here is that McLean was noting the existence of pictographs, including images of sundances, at a site along the Highwood that I presume was Zephyr Creek. While the quotation doesn't say actual sundance structures were illus trated, the lodge itself is certainly the one iconic image of the ceremonial event. If the intent was to illustrate the "sundance" I think something like Figure 16B would be the end result. If this theory is correct there may be other connections with the Sundance at Zephyr Creek. Figure 8 shows three or four human figures located below a structure that I believe may be a sun dance lodge. As the humans seem to have been painted at the same time and in purposeful association with the geometric, it is reasonable to assume that they are part of the story. They may be participants. Given that their poses suggest motion, they may be dancing at the ceremony. Recall that I pointed out the right arm of the upper left human is raised up as if reaching towards the centre pole of the geometric and that pigment at the bottom of the centre pole shows an appendage angled down towards the raised arm. But for a few centimetres of missing, weathered pig ment it looks as if this human figure was grasping the centre pole, connecting with the ceremony. Additionally, some of the motifs at Zephyr Creek could be representations of sweatlodges; the small dome-shaped structures that are typically associated with sundance lodge ceremo nies. I have seen these structures along side the sundance lodges going back over 30 years at Zephyr Creek, and Terry Quinn (personal communication 2010) saw and photographed them in 2009. The geometries that lack the upper pointed pole (Figures 6A, 7, and 13A) could be images of sweatlodges, which likewise have no protruding central pole. Note how the vertical lines at the outer edges of structure in Figure 13A are curved inward at the top where they join the horizontal line, much like the rounded edges of a sweatlodge. Thus, we have: 1) knowledge that the immediate Zephyr Creek area has been used for decades for sundances, includ ing sweatlodges; 2) an informant saying that images of sundances were painted at Journal Canadien d Archeologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="32">224 • BRINK a rock art site near the Highwood River; and 3) pictograph motifs at Zephyr Creek that can quite comfortably be interpreted as Sundance lodges and possibly other associated structures. While this new interpretation is of interest in itself, the argument that Sundance ceremonies were pictured at the Zephyr Creek site has further implications regarding the age of the images and the people who are responsible for making rock art at the site. The pictographs that were exceedingly fresh looking in 1965 and that include motifs I have said may be related to the Sundance (Figures 6, 7, and 11) would certainly not have existed in the 1920s when McLean told Barbeau (1960:210) that Sundance images were painted near the Highwood River. Another possible sundance structure that was somewhat older in 1965 (Figure 8) seems unlikely to have been present four decades earlier given that by 2009 it had nearly vanished (Figure 8D). The possible sundance or sweatlodge structure seen in Figure 13A was only first photographed in 1979 at which time it was already quite faint. It is difficult to imagine this pictograph was present at Zephyr Creek some 55 years earlier. McLean must have been referring to other pictographs no longer visible. Even if the posited Sundance/sweat lodge interpretation of these motifs is wrong, the implication remains that the historical references to rock art at the site in the 1920s must have been in reference to images not seen today and not likely present in 1965. If the historical refer ences are correctly identifying rock art at the site we know of as Zephyr Creek, then we know that pictographs were being made at the site at least as early as the first part of the twentieth century, that these were not the fresh images first pho tographed in 1965, and thus repeated production of rock art continued at least from the early twentieth century through the early 1960s. If I am correct in iden tifying several geometries as picturing Sundance structures, then we can further conclude that the ceremonies held in the Zephyr Creek valley for nearly a century have been a source of repeated inspi ration for rock art production. It also informs us on the issue of who made at least some of the rock art. Who Made the Images at Zephyr Creek ? There is no direct evidence, historical or archaeological, as to what people or peo ples made the rock art at Zephyr Creek. Keyser (1978:102), based on observation of only the two panels located in the overhang at the bottom of the bedrock ridge (Figures 3 and 4), and a photo graph of the fallen panel (Figure 11), suggested that the pictographs at Zephyr Creek were made by people from the Columbia Plateau region, specifically the Kootenai or Salish. He noted the similarity of certain motifs at Zephyr Creek with art from the Plateau areas of western Montana and southeastern Brit ish Columbia, and the similarity in the location of the site with the Plateau pat tern of remote, isolated settings where ritualized vision-questing activities were held (Keyser 1978:102-103). Keyser goes on to state that the pictographs were not likely of Stony origin. Although he cites a personal communication from a local informant that Stony people visited the site in the 1920s and left offerings of cloth and tobacco, Keyser (1978:103) states that the Stony are too recent to the region and that traditional hide paint ings and rock art of Assiniboine people are not similar to the style of images he observed at Zephyr Creek. Report ing on the upper panels which Keyser had not seen, I stated (Brink 1980:13) that assigning a cultural origin to these Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="33">DISAPPEARING DREAMS AT THE ZEPHYR CREEK ROCK ART SITE, ALBERTA • 225 images would await further analysis, but that scenes of a presumed buffalo hunt (Figure 5) was suggestive of a Plains affiliation. The appearance of the 1965 photographic record, further review of historic accounts, and the proposed identification of sundance-related activi ties in the rock art necessitate reconsid eration of these interpretations. What the 1965 photographs lend to the topic is clear evidence that rock art has been made at the site in the very recent past. If, as I suggest, pictographs were made as recently as ca. 1960, then it seems unlikely that these were the product of either Kootenai or Salish (Shuswap) groups. The site region is certainly within the traditional range of these and other western groups now generally restricted to southeastern Brit ish Columbia, northwestern Montana and northern Idaho (see Brunton 1998; Ignace 1998). By the mid-twentieth cen tury these people were living in towns and on reserves in these three jurisdic tions. None were located in Alberta, and no modern communities are especially close to the Alberta/British Columbia border. While it is not inconceivable that groups or even a few individuals of Kootenai or Shuswap affiliation made the journey from their modern homes to the Zephyr Creek region and created the art work, this seems unlikely. And they would have had to have done so repeatedly; some rock art was fresh in the mid 1960s, while historic citations from Barbeau (1960) and the statements of Pocaterra in Leechman et al. (1955) establish differ ent rock art at the site in the 1920s. The closest Aboriginal group to the site is the Nakoda Stoney, a Siouan speaking group of the Assiniboine Nation. Relative newcomers to Alberta, they split from their Siouan kin in the mid-seventeenth century and made their way to the Lake Winnipeg/Lake of the Woods region (McMillan 1995:154). Stoney elders said their movement west to the mountains had been occasioned by their desire to escape the diseases introduced by Europeans (Getty and Gooding 2001:596). When they arrived in far western Canada is a matter of some debate; the conventional view being that they moved west with the Cree in response to the effects of the fur trade, the alternate view being that their movement slightly preceded and was unconnected with the fur trade era (Russell 1991:172-173). They were pres ent in central Alberta by 1754, the time of the first written record, as attested by the journal of Anthony Henday (Russell 1991:181). Almost certainly they would have been in the foothills and moun tains of Alberta by the later part of the eighteenth century, and possibly earlier (Andersen 1970). By 1858 Stoney guides were leading members of the Palliser expedition through parts of what is now Banff National Park, and so were clearly at home and knowledgeable of the region (Whyte 1985:48). It is safe to say that Stoney people have been resident in the mountains and foothills of south western Alberta for over 200 years. There are several recognized groups of Stoney; of concern to us is the most southerly, the Bearspaw Band, which historically resided in southwestern Alberta (Dempsey 1986:43). Because Stoney reserve lands were poor for agriculture, they were permitted to con tinue hunting through the mountains and foothills while other tribal groups were restricted to reserves (Dempsey 1986:46). The Bearspaw Band gravitated towards the headwaters of the Highwood River and refused to leave the area even when denied government assistance (Dempsey 1986:47). Eventually the Fed Journal Canadien d Archéologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="34">226 • BRINK eral authorities capitulated and created a new, smaller reserve on the south bank of the Highwood River west of the town of Longview. The Eden Valley reserve is a long, thin strip of land, the western edge of which reaches to within about 5 km of the Zephyr Creek site. There is convincing evidence that the Stoney people were aware of and had visited the Zephyr Creek site at least as early as the 1920s and probably earlier. A geologist who saw the Zephyr Creek site in 1919, Dr. Bruce Rose, stated that, "The Stoney Indians hunt through this dis trict" (Leechman et al. 1955:41). Keyser (1978:103) cites a personal communica tion that Stoney people visited the site in the 1920s and left offerings of tobacco and cloth. Barbeau's informant, Daniel Wildman, was a Stoney Indian who had been to the site. George McLean, another Barbeau informant and a Stoney, was aware of the types of designs at a rock art site "on High River" which is very likely Zephyr Creek, although the citation does not specifically state he had been to the site. Stoney people led the local rancher George Pocaterra to the site in the 1920s. Additionally, Stoney people have been in the Highwood River region for probably 200 years, there is a Stoney reserve just a few kilometres distant from the site, and Stoney people did and continue to conduct their sun dance ceremonies in the Zephyr Creek valley. These facts might be irrelevant if there had not been evidence for the recent production of rock art, as many Native groups have historically moved into regions where rock art of other tribal groups exists. But the indisputable evidence that pictographs were made at Zephyr Creek as recently as about 1960, that additional pictographs were prob ably made in the decades immediately prior to that, and that some existed in the 1920s, combined with a strong Stoney presence in the region, argues convinc ingly for Stoney people having made at least much of the historically noted and recorded rock art at Zephyr Creek. Unsolved Issues at Zephyr Creek There remain unanswered questions about the Zephyr Creek rock art site. Determining if commercial paint was used as opposed to a local, iron-rich clay may be possible using portable x-ray fluorescence. Ethnographic work among the Stoney may assist in clarifying their relationship to the site, their role in producing rock art, and the meaning of various motifs. However, some issues will likely remain a puzzle: did Stoney people make all of the historically recorded and recently visible rock art at Zephyr Creek? and do any of the images predate the arrival of Stoney people in the region? While there are no definitive answers to these questions they can at least be addressed, albeit in a speculative manner. I suggest that stylistic differences indicate that more than one tribal group produced rock art at Zephyr Creek. The two pictograph scenes located at ground level under the overhang (Figures 3 and 4) appear stylistically different than the other rock art at the site. The bird image, interpreted as a thunderbird (Figure 3), is a static pose of a single figure; a depic tion of what is likely a mythical creature infused with considerable spiritual power. There is nothing else like it at Zephyr Creek; all other animals (fish, dogs, bison, antlered animals) are realistic in composition intended, presumably, to depict the actual animal not a mythical creature. Also, all except for the fish are shown in an action sequence that includes human beings. The other lower panel (Figure 4) features a human facing Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011 )</page><page sequence="35">DISAPPEARING DREAMS AT THE ZEPHYR CREEK ROCK ART SITE, ALBERTA • 227 the viewer and an animal in profile. Sig nificantly, although there is a clear rela tionship between the human and animal, the pose is static. The arms of the human are bent with hands raised and fingers extended. This is a classic pose of suppli cation; a person entreating him or herself to the spirit world, asking for guidance, assistance, knowledge, protection, and so forth (Keyser and Klassen 2001:215). The static thunderbird and the human next to a game animal fit the description of ceremonial rock art, while many of the pictographs higher up on the bedrock ridge fit the definition of narrative art (Keyser and Klassen 2001; Klassen 1998). While there is likely a ceremonial component to the making and viewing of nearly all rock art, some art is clearly recounting of events, real or imaginary; that is, narrative in pri mary purpose. Narrative art typically involves several figures engaged in some common relationship and in active poses (Klassen 2003). Scenes of battles, hunts, and horse capture are examples of nar rative art. At Zephyr Creek, pictographs seen in Figures 5, 6, 8, and 12 would be considered narrative art. Panels that contain only abstract or geometric fig ures, such as Figures 7, 9, 11, 14, and 10 except for the fish, cannot be classed as either ceremonial or narrative. There is nothing on the upper bedrock ridge that can be classified as ceremonial rock art. Based on perceived differences in style of execution, I suggest that the two lower panels under the bedrock overhang (Figures 3 and 4) were likely made by a different group of people than the currently remaining images at Zephyr Creek. Furthermore, I agree with Keyser's (1978:102) initial assessment that these two images are best classified as rock art most similar to that of the Columbia Plateau. As Keyser notes, the artistic structure of the anthropomorph, the large mammal and the thunderbird are all consistent with motifs seen in the plateau region (see Keyser 1992). Koo tenai or Salish artists are most probable. In addition to perceived stylistic dif ferences, there may be differences in the red pigment used to make some of the pictographs. While I have suggested that most were made with a locally avail able iron-rich deposit of earth or rock, a few images suggest use of a more tradi tional form of red ocher that included a binding agent, such as animal fat. Specifically, the four wavy lines at panel 1 (Figure 14) and the two lower panels under the overhang (Figures 3 and 4) appear different. At these locations the pigment, as first photographed, is a bright ocher-red colour, with more of a rust tint to it than is seen in some of the other very recent rock art on the upper bedrock slope (compare with the deep, blood red of Figures 5A and 6A). The four wavy lines at panel 1 have endured far better than other pictographs on the upper ridge despite being fully exposed to the elements. Over 30 years the pig ment, although somewhat faded, is still a rust-red colour, shows no evidence of bleeding and remains highly visible (Fig ures 14A-D). That the pigment used on the two lower panels (Figures 3 and 4) has weathered far less than other picto graphs at Zephyr Creek cannot in itself be used to argue for this being a different composition of red paint, as the protec tion offered by the overhang is certainly a key factor in preservation of the images. Still, the appearance of the pigment is more reminiscent of traditional ochre. If the lower two pictographs are of a different style, and they and the wavy lines were made with traditional red ochre, it suggests that they may have been made by other people and at a Journal Canadien d'Archéologie 35 (2011)</page><page sequence="36">228 • BRINK different time than the other images at Zephyr Creek. It is conceivable that previous groups occupying this region of the eastern slopes, Kootenai or Salish, had made the rock art at the two lower panels and that these highly visible images served as an attraction for later groups to use the same site. If this did happen, why these earlier groups might have ascended the bedrock ridge to make the wavy line motif, but apparently nothing else, is perplexing. The pigment of Figure 14 has preserved notably better over the past decades than all other images on the ridge. Pending further analysis, I suggest that the wavy lines at panel 1 and the two lower pictographs were made earlier than the other images at Zephyr Creek, that they were made with a traditional form of red ochre that included a binding agent, and that they were likely made by a different cultural group than the local Stoney, prob ably members of the Kootenai or Salish tribes. If these three motifs are older in age, I suspect that it is not by a great deal, in that all exhibit some weathering over the past three to four decades. It is unlikely that any art at Zephyr Creek is older than late pre-contact times. Conclusion Photographs of rock art at the Zephyr Creek site taken in 1965 establish une quivocally that many pictographs were extremely fresh at that date, with some likely painted only a few years prior and others perhaps a decade or two earlier. Comparison of these photographs with subsequent ones further documents that most pictographs at Zephyr Creek have been weathering extremely rapidly, with some having nearly vanished in about four decades. Combined, these two facts have important implications regarding interpretation of this site. The mid-twentieth century date for much of the rock art argues for produc tion by the local Aboriginal group, the Stoney people, who reside only a few kilometres away. This is in contrast to the previously accepted belief that the pic tographs were likely the work of plateau groups such as the Kootenai or Salish. The case for a Stoney origin would be strength ened if I have correctly inferred that some of the modfs at Zephyr Creek may be rep resentations of sundance-related activities and structures, as the local Stoney people have historically used the Zephyr Creek valley for their Sundance ceremony. Inter views with contemporary Stoney could help confirm this association. The rapid erosion of much of the artwork is believed to be the result of a number of factors, especially the exposed nature of the panels, but possibly includ ing acid rain and the dolomite bedrock surface. However, the appearance of the pigment, and a historic reference to the paint being made of only spirit-red earth with no additional ingredients, argues for rapid erosion due to lack of a bind ing agent as found in traditional forms of red ochre. Time-transgressive com parisons of South African rock art came to similar conclusions: that post-contact pictographs were fading more rapidly than older ones, and that the former may have been made without use of a binding agent in the pigment. That the immedi ate Zephyr Creek site area is rich in iron ore deposits reinforces a scenario where local artists quarried the ore and made paint from a simple slurry of crushed (possibly heated) iron and water. This unfixed paint would erode quickly. The use of an expedient pigment, the subse quent rapid weathering of pictographs, and photographic proof that some have nearly disappeared in the past decades, may help explain confusing historical Canadian Journal of Archaeology 35 (2011 )</page><page sequence="37">DISAPPEARING DREAMS AT THE ZEPHYR CREEK ROCK ART SITE, ALBERTA • 229 accounts of motifs said to be at Zephyr Creek which were not visible in 1965. That is, images painted in the early part of the twentieth century—those men tioned in historic records—would have disappeared by the mid 1960s. It is possible that groups other than the Stoney left artwork at Zephyr Creek. The two pictographs at the lowest panel under an overhang appear stylistically different from the other images. These two pictographs are consistent with ceremonial art of plateau cultures and may have been the work of Kootenai or Salish groups. One other pictograph on the upper bedrock ridge seems to have been painted with more traditional red ochre and if so could also be the work of a different group. It is suspected that all of the rock art at Zephyr Creek is no older than late post-contact in age. In addition to revising some inter pretations of the Zephyr Creek site, the 1965 photographic record docu ments the making of rock art in the mid-twentieth century; almost certainly a rare and noteworthy occurrence in western North America. No evidence has yet been discovered at or near the site that this practice has continued since that date; likewise a noteworthy and cur rently unexplained situation. While this paper has tried to shed some new light on an interesting and important rock art site in southwestern Alberta, there are undoubtedly more untold stories about Zephyr Creek that remain to be researched. Acknowledgements. Special thanks to John Wiigs of Turner Valley, Alberta. Thirty-three years after our first contact I was delighted to find him alive and well. John allowed me to use his early photographs of the site, and recounted for me his experience with Zephyr Creek. Colleagues the late John Dormaar, Michael Klassen, and ierry Qumn allowed me to use photographs from their personal collections. Paulina Johnson assisted with research regarding the Stoney people, and Robin Woywitka helped with Figure 1. Comments by James D. Keyser, Lawrence Loendorf, Aron Mazel and Gerald Oetelaar corrected errors and improved the paper. This is in memory of friend and colleague John Dormaar, who in 1991 wrote me to say that something was happening to the picto graphs at Zephyr Creek Notes 1. Because of the importance to this paper of changes in visibility and colour of pictographs over time, most of the photographs reproduced here have not been corrected or adjusted for colour in any way. The excep tions are those noted as employing DStretch software. I have adjusted the brightness for some original pho tographs that were especially light or dark, and cropped or rotated a few to facilitate comparison. 2. The quote from Barbeau says a "leg" was walking behind the person. I assume this is a typographical error and that the proper word should be "dog". This makes sense, and there are several images at Zephyr Creek of dogs with humans. 3. This statement in Barbeau (1960) is repeated in Leechman et al. (1955:44-45) but is attributed to Jonas Rider, who along with Daniel Wildman was an informant to Bar beau. As Barbeau seems to be the primary source, I have accepted the attribution to Wildman, and also used the exact wording of quotes from Bar beau as oppose to those from Leech man et al. which occasionally differ. 4. In my 1980 article I incorrectly attrib uted these statements to Harlan I.

His Native name was Walking Buffalo, he received his English name when adopted by a Methodist missionary. He went on to become a highly respected leader, medicine man and chief of the Bearspawband (Manry 2010:104-105).
