Ethnography and Autobiographical Voicing in the Mediated Text What one tries to capture in writing is the voice, the autobio- graphical discourse of those who do not write .... Their story takes its value, in the eyes of the reader, from the fact that they belong (that they are perceived as belonging) to a culture other than his own, a culture defined by the exclusion of writing. The bookstore exploits an ethnological type of curiosity.... The admission of collaboration ... becomes here an essential piece of the system: it is a matter of guaranteeing that the model has written nothing! (Lejeune 196) Sometimes the woman go to the doctor and ask them if they are pregnant. They are only one or two months. The doctor checks them and says, "No, I don't think so." So they come back to me, and they say, "Jesusita, I came to see you, I think I'm pregnant." So I check them, and I can tell them when they are one month. Two is easy. And I can tell them when it's a tumor. Sometimes they're going to the doctor ... and say, "I don't know what's the matter with me; I have a hard pain," but the doctor can't say. So they come to me, and I check them, and I call the doctor that is taking care of them, and I ? 1993 by Cultural Critique. Fall 1993. 0882-4371/93/$5.00. 177</page><page sequence="2">178 Anne E. Goldman tell him, "Did you know what's the matter with this?"... "No." I say, "I know, she's going back to you and give her some X-rays. She's got a tumor." And they take my word, the doc- tors. (Buss 76) found Jesusita Arag6n's self-affirming voice compelling from the start. Here was someone who recounted her difficulties not so much to exact sympathy as to emphasize her successful nego- tiation of them. The editorial comments that followed upon what I considered to be the speaker's own narrative in La Partera: Story of a Midwife thus seemed particularly jarring. Where Arag6n cri- tiqued the American Medical Association's intervention into New Mexican birthing techniques, Fran Leeper Buss commended the Anglo-American medical system's regulatory intercession. Armed with statistics, the editor insisted on representing the doctor as benevolent patriarch, kindly condescending to instruct the natives in the miracles of modern medicine. Yet the speaker herself had continuously positioned the Anglo obstetrician in relation to her- self as Hispana midwife in a way that did little to compliment the talents of the former. If this interpretive intercession was distress- ing, such clear narrative conflict nevertheless forced me to reap- praise Aragon's position in an autobiography which omitted to mention her own name, and to consider the relations between speakers and editors in collaborative texts more generally. To what extent could the speaker work against the interpretive rubric im- posed-so firmly in the case of La Partera-by the editor? If I had been compelled by the directness of Arag6n's voice recounting her work on behalf of others, I had to question what might be motivating such an interest when, returning to the li- brary to find other such voices, I encountered quite a number, seemingly made-to-order, on the shelves. Looking more closely at these recently published life histories of women in order to con- sider not only the power of their voices but the power relations inflecting such speaker-editor collaborations, I noticed a number of patterns.l Typically, the books were published by university presses. Usually, there was a clear class distinction between the editor, a professional woman with an interest in furthering fem- inist work, and the speaker, a working-class woman with a com- mitment to serving her community. Often these texts inscribed a</page><page sequence="3">Is That What She Said? 179 racial or ethnic difference as well, with a woman of color recount- ing the story of her life and work to a white woman who would then publish it. Arag6n's La Partera: Story of a Midwife and Onnie Lee Logan's Motherwit: An Alabama Midwife's Story are cases in point. Published as part of the University of Michigan Press's Women and Culture Series, La Partera is clearly produced out of recent feminist inter- est in working-class women and women of color, people previ- ously ignored by Anglo-American literary scholarship. While Motherwit is less obviously the product of the Academy's discovery of "other voices," E. P. Dutton has nevertheless marketed the book with an eye toward the commercial confluence of gender and cultural studies, as is evident by a glance at the endorsements from James Mellon (editor of Bullwhip Days: The Slaves Remember), Susan Tucker (whose book Telling Memories of Southern Women examines interracial relations between women), and Alice Chil- dress (author of Like One of the Family), all of which grace the back cover. Prefatory and concluding material in both books under- scores the quality of self-reliant femininity which both Arag6n and Logan demonstrate in their narratives, situating their stories, as the back cover of La Partera advertises, as illustrations of the "hard and useful lives" of rural, working-class women of color. As Philippe Lejeune indicates in "The Autobiography of Those Who Do Not Write," such class and race inflections suggest that we pay closer attention not only to the dynamics of speaker- editor relations in particular texts but also to the context of the production of collaborative narratives more generally. And clearly, the inequities of power implicit in the process of speaking, collecting, writing, editing, and publishing life histories implicate the consumers of the products of this literary work as well. Not to mention the critics. Granting that editorial preroga- tive often works counter to the narrative goals of the speaker herself, where am I to situate my own commentary on these texts? I argue that editorial agenda can mask but not obliterate the imperatives of the speakers; if we attend more closely to the dis- cursive patterns in specific women's narratives, we can begin to pick up the necessarily oblique theorizing about race and gender politics-as well as about many other issues-encoded in them. Listening to such critiques demands attention to the complicated</page><page sequence="4">180 Anne E. Goldman intersection of any number of factors operating simultaneously: racial exploitation, generational tensions, inequities between ur- ban and rural populations, class differences, gender conflict, the shifting particulars of state politics and social relations at specific points in time. Yet while I am interested in refocusing attention on what tends to be filtered out by the editorial lens, my own preoccupations obviously override other concerns of the speak- ers. My interpretive activity then-speaking as a white feminist academic-implicates me in the same political network I am con- cerned with tracing out in this article. Certainly the affirmative and assertive histories recounted in these narratives are compel- ling for critics and readers who insist that the Academy begin to listen to other voices. Working in the service of politically respon- sible criticism nevertheless requires that we consider a number of questions. Why is this particular textual formation currently so popular with scholarly presses and institutions? What functions do such books serve for readers and critics? If questions of form are contingent upon format, as Arnold Krupat has concisely stated of Native American narrative, we cannot isolate either the content or the presentation of any life history from the methods used to obtain it (225). Consistently, however, literary, sociological, and anthropological studies posi- tion the subject of discourse-even when she is speaking in the first person-as a textualized object, malleable to the researcher's own interests and academic uses. And in the interests of more faithfully rendering quality of voice, they are inclined to ignore, even to conceal, the intersubjective context out of which such narratives are generated. In a discussion of the status of field work in anthropological research, Kevin Dwyer takes the work of Clifford Geertz as symptomatic of the way in which this pro- fessional blind spot has been sustained, arguing that while he recognizes field work as "constructive activity" (260), Geertz de- nies the dialectical relation of speaker and editor at the moment it is in play, recognizing it only at the level of "theoretical activity" (260): at the most basic level of the "small fact," of the informant's interpretation, Geertz systematically refuses to see the anthro- pologist in his or her human relation to the informant or to</page><page sequence="5">Is That What She Said? 181 accept the inevitable interdependence of Self and Other at the very origin of the search for "information". . . . The dialectical confrontation, for Geertz, does not take place dur- ing the field encounter with the Other, but is restricted to the privacy of the anthropologist's study. (261, 263) The inability of Geertz, Rabinow, Rosen, and others to acknowl- edge the extent to which a participatory relation governs the pro- duction of the anthropological text (and here we could substitute "literary" text, given the flexible discursive parameters any post- modern critical theory presumes) tends at once to objectify one of the participants in this process and to ignore the history of impe- rialism which informs such interracial "collaborations." Yet as Dwyer very acutely points out, recognizing this history is crucial to any analysis of first-person narratives: "mere participation . . . inevitably locates the Self culturally as the 'outsider' intruding on the Other's terrain, and historically as a representative of a society that has a prior history of intrusion" (274). Nor should we assume that an intraracial collaboration will necessarily avoid the abuses of a coercive discursive and political history. Clearly differences of class, gender, and region (not to mention of political agenda) also inflect speaker-editor relations. Yet regardless of these factors, any writing which invokes an eth- nographic frame of reference necessarily must engage with its (historically produced) premises as well, notwithstanding the spe- cific material-political circumstances of any given editor-speaker pair. The subject of an intraracial inquiry, then, is not necessarily immune from definition as ethnographic object.2 I would like to focus for the moment on mediated texts which inscribe racial difference, however. Even a quick glance at the following excerpts from La Partera: Story of a Midwife and Motherwit: An Alabama Midwife's Story tends to confirm the way in which autobiographical voicing is contained and muted by the assumptions of ethnographic discourse: I met Jesusita Arag6n, the last of the traditional, Hispanic midwives in the area, through several women who had babies with her.... I knew immediately she had a story worth telling, and Jesusita was eager to tell it. (vii)</page><page sequence="6">182 Anne E. Goldman She was the last granny midwife in Mobile and one of the last in Alabama.... Caught in the flux of a changing culture, Onnie is an unusual victim of historical "progress." (xiii) Brief as they are, such editorial comments indicate how narratives produced out of an interracial collaboration may reproduce in some measure the disabling history of race relations in the United States. Their commitment to representing Jesusita Aragon and Onnie Lee Logan as speaking subjects places the editors within social science methodological traditions in which, as Genaro Pa- dilla argues of recent life histories of Mexican immigrants, the "I-speaking voice" is "simultaneously privileged and dismissed" (6). Notwithstanding an attempt to represent the idiosyncrasies of verbal presence and intonation, their introductions work against autobiographical self-formation by situating the speakers as a kind of cultural litmus paper. Arag6n and Logan, that is, are introduced to us as "the last" of a kind of "traditional" practitio- ner. Their distinction-that singularity which should justify their autobiographical stature-is to be a type, the single survivor of a deteriorating culture. Buss's preface recalls the nineteenth- century literary iconography of the "noble savage" in that it positions Arag6n as the last of a dying breed, archetype of a "broken" culture (13). Similarly, Onnie Lee Logan's distinction is to be a "victim," "the last granny midwife in Mobile and one of the last in Alabama." It is precisely because she is a rare specimen, the editor's description implies, that Logan's story is valued at all. This conflict between presencing and preservation suggests in microcosm the problematic relation between autobiographical and ethnographic impulses in life histories more generally. Ech- oed by Katherine Clark's elegy to Logan as having "faithfully and successfully served one world only to be told by the next that she was no longer needed" (xiii-xiv), such books frame the compli- cated question of cultural identity within a system of binary ab- solutes where one means of signifying identity has been "van- quished" by its successor. In the context of a politically oppressive environment continually speaking homogenization to a cultural- political "mainstream," it is perhaps all too easy to envision the means of assigning cultural value as a process controlled by an</page><page sequence="7">Is That What She Said? 183 ideological monopoly. But cultures are not created and re-created in accordance with a Darwinian teleology, the imposing of "one world's" rituals over a now-anachronistic tradition. Produced out of the historical context of imperialism, ethnographic discourse defines what is in fact a synchronic process between multiple, continually flexible cultural relations as a diachronic history, a story of cultural rise and fall.3 What ethnography often forgets, however, is that this "history" is itself a description produced as a response to anxiety about the inability to subdue the articulations of people who define themselves in contradistinction to dominat- ing models. Lejeune's attention to collaborative writing as a negotiation "between the model's supply and the public's demand" (189) very acutely situates the narrative as the product and outcome of a complicated and often conflicting series of intentions. Despite this sophisticated political analysis, however, which deconstructs the concept of "authority" as historically contingent, "a relative and conventional thing" (193), defining the speaker as one who "is reduced to the state of source" (189) nevertheless positions this particular authority as the very museum piece described by Buss and Logan's editorial imperative. In this critique of the manner by which power relations objectify the subject, the subject serves as object lesson. The word "model" which Lejeune uses to describe the speaker is particularly curious in this regard; the product of a mixed metaphor, not to mention mixed media, it suggests the still silence of the painter's model, the (generally) female subject who best fulfills her function when she is most able to mime the plastic immobility of the statue.4 It seems to me that this is the danger of deconstructing the subject, an operation which Lejeune perhaps carries out too well. To assert that the narrative of the mediated text "is not the writing of an identifiable and personal 'other,' but a kind of floating writing, an autobiographical form with no subject to ground it" (189) is to reproduce the coercive context in which such writing is produced, to ignore the material product of such literary effort (and specifically its title page, which assigns authority, however arbitrarily, to someone), and to forget that the "other" may exercise the ability (even if it must be carried out in an oblique fashion) to speak against editorial appropriation. If, as Lejeune has stated,</page><page sequence="8">184 Anne E. Goldman the collaborative text "blurs in a disturbing way the question of responsibility" (192), then just to whom one assigns responsibility remains a question rather than a given. Similarly, the critic's for- mulation, "the one to whom the responsibility is given," assumes an agency (albeit one which is either acceding to or dispensing with authority) which we need to examine, not dismiss.5 I would suggest that if we look more closely at the narratives of mediated texts, we can find the traces-sometimes played out explicitly in the interpretive conflicts and argumentative tensions between editorial preface and speaker's text, often articulated more obliquely in her preemption of or resistance to the process of textualizing her life history-of the speaker's insistence on maintaining her own status as author. Inequities of class, race, generation, and education aside, collaboration does not necessar- ily mean capitulation. Textual politics in La Partera and Motherwit do not prevent either Aragon or Logan from critiquing practices they see as rac- ist, for instance. Given the combined onslaught of medical hostil- ity and editorial inattention-often, resistance-to the speakers' race-inflected critiques, however, it is not surprising that both women resort to rhetorical camouflage in order to make their points. Such critiques of the way racism operates are frequently encoded in different discursive modes than is the language of feminine self-affirmation: an apparently conciliatory rhetoric, for instance, often provides a means to theorize about race politics while allowing the speaker to maintain a nonthreatening posture of humility and nonaggressiveness.6 Many of Arag6n's most tell- ing indictments of AMA medicine, for example, are prefaced by the phrase "I don't know." Consider how this reiterated gesture of humility prefaces the speaker's most significant rebuttals to Anglo health practices in the following passage: So many things have changed over the years. Many things change in how we deliver babies. When I first be a midwife, some mothers give birth the old way; the way that's gone now ... I deliver two that way, and one of them was my sister-in- law. I don't know why, but with her first baby, she kneels down, and she says "I feel better that way." So kneeling down is not too hard. And another lady, she does the same thing. It helps. I don't know why they stop doing that way, why they start laying</page><page sequence="9">Is That What She Said? 185 on their backs. I think because to squat down is an old-fash- ioned way. (63, emphasis added) A cursory reading might frame this comparison as noncommittal, a lament for tradition more quizzical than critical. A closer look suggests that the discussion develops a sustained argument on a number of levels, however. Arag6n's emphasis on the "help" that squatting provides in easing labor pains implicitly censures phy- sicians for their cavalier neglect of the mother's welfare by sug- gesting that the change in methods has more to do with their out-of-hand dismissal of any practice typed as the "old-fashioned way" than any considered opinion about the advantages and dis- advantages of a particular technique. And by initially invoking change to signify difference in the abstract ("So many things have changed over the years") she frames the specific change in birth method as argumentative support for a more general thesis about cultural change. Thus the charge against "modern" medical prac- tice encodes a racial inflection as well, for "the old way" is implic- itly defined as Hispano here, "change" enforced by an Anglo- American system which disparages established practices without regard to their merit. Often comments designed to condemn racial oppression are developed circuitously in a series of sentences which may look contradictory. A particularly telling criticism may be prefaced by a concession which blunts the edge of the critique and makes it more palatable to a listener who the speaker anticipates might otherwise have trouble avoiding defensiveness. Note how Logan describes the turn from home remedies to over-the-counter drugs: Open up the chest from the smell of the turpentine. No doc- tor-had to have some kinda medicine. It worked. But now since the world gets weaker and wiser the doctors has gotten to the place and science has gotten to the place they makes all these other medicines to take the place of those old Indian remedies. You don't have to have so much of it now. Befo' it wasn't to be bought. (62) Initially Logan appears to be describing turpentine as a medical anachronism, a rough approximation of "some kinda medicine"</page><page sequence="10">186 Anne E. Goldman to be discarded with the advent of physicians' pharmaceuticals. Certainly the discourse of progress is here; insisting "You don't have to have so much of it now" locates the earlier remedy as a historical necessity rather than a preferred cure. Yet Logan sub- verts the very language of medical progress the passage appears to be supporting. The emphatic assertion of the third sentence, for instance, insists that we not discredit practical solutions merely because they are less glamorous than medical substitutes. The following sentence builds on the implicit critique of this phrase, the alliteration of "weaker" with "wiser" throwing into question the nature of this medical "advance." All of this quiet irony works to destabilize the discourse of progress, allowing us to read into the final assertion, "it wasn't to be bought," a marked sense of loss, a recognition of a kind of knowledge beyond the dictates of the medical marketplace. Acknowledging how autobiographical desire and ethno- graphic necessity often position speaker and editor at odds should not lead us to assume that every editor is either oblivious to or unable to resist the historical and literary pressures tending to position transcriber and subject in unequal relation. In fact, a closer analysis of edited life histories suggests that "those who do not write" often do; editorial acknowledgement and prefatory comments frequently acknowledge the extent to which the speak- ing subject is a writing subject, sharing the work of transmuting spoken word into print. Rather than assuming that the manner in which the title page divides responsibility between authority and life history represents the final and only word on the relation between speaker and editor, we need instead to contextualize this assignment of textual ownership with respect to the dialectical process which produces the edited text as a whole. 2. Reappraising Authority in the Mediated Text Deciding just who is constituted as the author for any given collaborative text remains, however, a complicated question to answer. The literary authority vested in the signature provides one account of the relation between subject and editor, but as Lejeune indicates, authorial status</page><page sequence="11">Is That What She Said? 187 has different aspects, which can be dissociated and possibly also shared: the juridical responsibility, the moral and intel- lectual right, literary ownership (with the financial rights re- lated to it), and the signature, which, at the same time that it refers to the juridical problem, is part of a textual device (cover, title, preface, etc.) through which the reading contract is established. (193) Granting that authority is not a divine or natural right but rather an historical, legal, and textual privilege, however, does not oblit- erate its power nor does it mean that readers can simply forgo their responsibility to question its relation to the narratives of mediated texts. Deconstructing "the 'life"' by indicating that it "belongs to both of them-but perhaps also, for the same reason, belongs neither to one nor to the other" (192), as Lejeune asserts, is a potentially dangerous evasion of the practical ramifications of publishing a collaborative text, for it provides a justification for the very appropriation which the critic condemns. Nor should we assume, I think, that it is the writer who "is entrusted with all the duties of structuring, of control, of communication with the out- side ... condensing, summarizing, eliminating the inferior parts, choosing the lines of relevance, establishing an order, a progres- sion" (189).7 The absence of any real description of the textual process does not necessarily imply that this labor has not been intersubjective; it may, in fact, only point to an editor's desire to maintain interpretive control over the narrative. If such studied editorial inattention is not uncommon, there remain editors who acknowledge how their organizing and struc- turing techniques contribute to the form of the narrative and provide a rationale for glossing its contents. Bob Blauner's asser- tion in "Problems of Editing 'First-Person' Sociology" that "the editing process virtually is the analysis" (47) is confirmed by Pat Ellis Taylor's afterword to Border Healing Woman: The Story ofJewel Babb (1981): I am afraid that my confessed interest in her ability to heal led her into certain emphases on the material that she might not have chosen herself .... The information she gave me on other facets of her life was at least as extensive as the infor- mation she gave me on healing. (104)</page><page sequence="12">188 Anne E. Goldman Nor is Taylor alone in acknowledging the extent to which the narrative "present" is constructed by the editor, "coming to the healer with pad and pencil in hand" (104). In Lemon Swamp and Other Places: A Carolina Memoir (1980), Karen Fields positions her- self as "collaborating author" alongside her grandmother, Mamie Garvin Fields. She does not offer her prefatory and concluding statements as interpretive index or "scientific" apparatus, framing devices which inevitably situate the speaker's narrative as a form of ethnographic data inaccessible to the reader without editorial assistance.8 Rather, she uses such comments to assert the text as the "outcome" of "an extended conversation" which "involves our two subjectivities, not hers alone" (xiii). By emphasizing her fa- milial relation to the autobiographical subject, Fields runs the risk of sanctifying her editorial work as appropriate because in some way "natural." If this familial self-authorization avoids positioning the subject of the narrative as ethnographic other, then, it may unself-consciously affirm the relation between two collaborating but nonetheless distinct subjects, and in so doing obscure the la- bor of textual production. Fields' perception that the book works in part to reconstruct a genealogy between granddaughter and grandmother inclines in this direction: We both came to feel that even if Lemon Swamp never saw the light of day, our enterprise would have justified itself. After all, how many grandmothers and granddaughters have the opportunity of befriending one another as adults? (xii) Yet her acknowledgement of the conflicts between the two re- minds readers that the text is, in fact, the product of a dialogue between people "who find their way through the disagreements that arise inevitably and who work to spell out for themselves the agreements that must be conveyed to others" (xii). Just as the insistence on compromise asserts the text as constructive activity, her admission of editorial fallibility (discussion "showed me as- pects of belonging to a Southern community that would not have occurred to me to ask about, while showing us both differences between our standpoints" [xii-xiii]) reauthorizes the speaker, pre- venting her objectification as textual evidence for an editorial thesis.</page><page sequence="13">Is That What She Said? 189 Fields' assessment of the way in which narrative conflict is necessarily generated by any collaborative project remains the exception rather than the rule, however. More often than not, vigorous assertion of editor-speaker entente ends up looking more like a pretext for masking editorial intent than an explana- tion of joint interpretive effort. Frequently, initiative for the col- laborative project is not assigned jointly but is represented as wholeheartedly the speaker's impulse. I would like now to look more closely at a number of mediated life histories which dem- onstrate this pattern. 3. "The initiative for the project was hers": Concealing Editorial Mediation in Collaborative Autobiography Jesusita was anxious to share her story with someone, and we eventually met together a number of times.... The following then, is the story of Jesusita Arag6n. The story is told in her own words and contains glimpses into the lives of many oth- ers. Many of the names have been changed to protect people's privacy, but the facts of their hard, and useful, lives remain the same. (Buss 7, 16) Onnie has always regarded midwifery as her real life's work, however, and the inspiration for this project came not from me, but from her overwhelming desire "not to die with it," as she said-not to die without sharing the "wisdom and knowl- edge" but especially the stories from her lifetime of experi- ence. Onnie, a semiliterate woman with little formal educa- tion, told me she was "gonna write this book" if she "had to scratch it out" herself. "I got so much experience in here that I just want to explode," she told me. (Logan ix) A quick glance at the titles of the books I have cited above clarifies the shared interest of their editors. Both life histories focus on the relation between gender and the practice of "alter- native" medicine, as these techniques are defined by the medical establishment in the United States. Through the stories of Jesusita Arag6n and Onnie Lee Logan, Fran Leeper Buss and Katherine Clark demonstrate how women committed to serving their com-</page><page sequence="14">190 Anne E. Goldman munities manage to maintain this commitment in the face of strong pressures denying the authority and validity of their own healing practices. But they demonstrate as well, I would argue, the pressure which ethnographic inquiry exerts on autobiograph- ical voicing. Significantly, the titles of these edited autobiogra- phies omit the names of their subjects, introducing the speakers as illustrations of an occupational type.9 The two books, in fact, ap- pear to tell the same story, a generic one about "traditional" mid- wifery. In that it works to define the subject as historical source rather than agent of history, this occlusion of the name suggests that what is editorially compelling is not so much the autobio- graphical authority of the speakers as their ethnographic status: they indicate the relation between a particular embattled labor and the "marginal" women who practice it. Introducing a life as exemplary rather than uncommon sug- gests we consider how ethnographic interest creates and defines a market for a kind of "autobiography" which is not one. For the reader trying to negotiate the relation between editor and speaker, between scholarly interest and personal agenda in the mediated text, the relationship between editorial imperative and textual initiative poses another question. Who is given credit for prompting the telling of a particular life history, and why? In both La Partera and Motherwit, the absence of information about the process of transcribing spoken word into text is matched only by editorial eagerness to assign initiative for the collaboration to the speakers whose narratives they are editing. In contrast, Pat Ellis Taylor's editorial work with Border Healing Woman: The Story of Jewel Babb (and note that this particular por- trait of the "traditional" healer at least invokes a specific individ- ual in the subtitle, if not the title proper) involves quite extensive documentation and explanation of the narrative's construction, and this acknowledgement is paralleled by an admission both of her own interest in Jewel Babb and of the way in which such perceptions help to represent the speaker in a manner often quite different from Mrs. Babb's own self-assertion. While it would be irresponsible to generalize here, the pattern developed in these three texts seems clear. Representing the collaboration as one without conflict and defining the textual initiative as the speaker's work to mask editorial imperative and to justify intervention</page><page sequence="15">Is That What She Said? 191 when that intercession, albeit unacknowledged, comes into con- flict with the speaker's own interests. Mentioning only that in producing La Partera she and Dofia Arag6n "shared countless long distance phone calls" (vii), Fran Leeper Buss refrains from describing the division of responsibil- ity which the transcription from spoken to written word entails, emphasizing instead the collaborative nature of the project: "We tape recorded our many conversations and from the tapes I have organized the story of her life and work" (8). The actual process of producing the text is left obscure. Did the two meet to discuss the way that these conversations would be "organized" by the editor? What principles of selection did Buss use to transform hours of taped recollections and dialogue into the 72 pages of text we are left with? While, as Blauner indicates, "editing personal narratives is a creative process which actively shapes materials by reducing them" (51), what takes the place of any such admission in La Partera is a substitution of gesture for word, a picture of rapport between editor and speaker so complete it need not be commu- nicated through speech. Buss foregrounds her memories of Ara- g6n's "touch, the touch of her arms as she embraced me, the memory of her hands stroking mine, holding them in times of greeting and parting, and touching them for reassurance or em- phasis" (8) while leaving unrecorded the inevitable conflicts which arise in any effort at communication: disagreements, misunder- standings, differences in emphasis, corrections, amplifications, questions. As Patricia Zavella indicates in "Recording Chicana Life Histories: Refining the Insider's Perspective": rapport is not automatic ... it is a continual process to achieve intimacy not only with the same informant through successive interviews, but also throughout each encounter.... We also need to anticipate that our status as insiders will only allow an entrance. From there, because we are also outsiders, we must be prepared for reticence, political differences and various social distances. (20-21) Ignoring the difficulties dialogue involves, Buss's insistence on elemental harmony avoids emphasizing what should be a crucial</page><page sequence="16">192 Anne E. Goldman admission in this interracial collaboration: the question of differ- ence. Such erasure erodes Arag6n's position as autobiographical authority. Further, the editor's introduction provides an interpre- tive rubric for Arag6n's narrative which directs readers to per- ceive this text as contiguous-more precisely, as illustrating an editorial thesis. That this imperative is ideologically at odds with the speaker's own is the subject of an essay in its own right. Suffice to say here, however, that what is foregrounded in Buss's intro- duction are not really the events of Arag6n's life. Instead, such prefatory comments provide an exposition of a culture in decline: a New Mexican landscape imaged both from postcard vistas and the modernist interest in primitivism, where skies are perennially "turquoise," the sun constantly "brilliant," the desert always "vast," "stark," and "immense" (2-3). The language of ethnogra- phy presents itself in other ways as well: in consistent images of deserted adobes crumbling in Parthenon-like silent grandeur, of "deteriorating buildings" (12) and "broken" windmills (13), of churches "fallen into disarray" (14) and "the graves of relatives and friends" (14)-in sum, a description not of people, but their "remains" (13). Notwithstanding a commitment to convey the nuances of Arag6n's speech, invoking the discourse of what I can only call "romantic ethnography" (consider its elegiac tone and lament for lone survivors) inevitably works against autobiographical presenc- ing, reducing the speaking subject to artifact. As I have already indicated, however, this ethnographic imperative is not specific to La Partera. Like Buss's figuring of Arag6n as midwife, Katherine Clark's titling of Onnie Lee Logan's narrative as Motherwit: An Alabama Midwife's Story constructs the speaker as representative subject. This story of a midwife-glossed as such by Clark's preface-is as poorly documented as La Partera. Clark provides no acknowledgement of the way in which the narrative has been constructed, other than to affirm that it is Logan who provides the "inspiration" for the project. In fact, the speaker is repre- sented as being on the verge of "exploding" with the desire to "write this book," if, despite her status as "semiliterate woman with little formal education" (according to her editor), "she 'had to scratch it out' herself" (ix). Such strenuous advocating of Logan's</page><page sequence="17">Is That What She Said? 193 agency here seems suspect, for it insists simultaneously on the urgency of the speaker's need to textualize her life history and the urgency of editorial intercession-since Logan barely writes, someone else must be persuaded to assist her. This scrutinizing of editorial motive is severe, yet it seems to me necessary as a corrective for the lack of self-scrutiny provided by Clark herself. Perhaps the quotation which follows this assign- ment of responsibility makes the point more clear, for it con- structs the impetus for the project as contingent with the speaker's anticipation of her own death, as the shift in verb tense indicates: "'I got so much experience in here that I just want to explode,' she told me. 'I want to show that I knew what I knew-I want somebody to realize what I am"' (ix-x, emphasis added). Succeed- ing upon the definition of "midwifery as her real life's work," a work she wants to describe in order "'not to die with it'" (ix), this description for the text's inspiration suggests that the narrative motive is one of sanctification, to enshrine a person/practice which is passing. Like La Partera and Motherwit, He Included Me: The Autobiog- raphy of Sarah Rice (1989) at once obscures editorial motive and styles the speaker as cultural anachronism. In Louise Westling's account, the editor acts only because she is called at the behest of the speaker to provide the necessary technological apparatus. "The initiative for the project was hers," Westling affirms, echo- ing the editors of interracial textual collaborations as a whole, "in response to the urging of family members and friends that she record the story of her life. Through my sisters and brother in Jacksonville, she let me know that she would like my help" (xi). Yet clearly whether or not speaker or editor initially prompts the telling of the life story, the process of collaboration itself con- structs a subject quite distinct from the authority who writes her history without the assistance of another. To insist, then, that "Control of the narrative's shape and progress was always Mrs. Rice's. My job was simply to turn on the tape recorder and occa- sionally interject a question for clarification" (xi) is to ignore the entire context of the story's production. Since one presumes that Mrs. Rice could have performed this mechanical operation by herself, this positioning of the editor cannot help but look disin- genuous, an editorial sleight of hand to mask the mediated nature</page><page sequence="18">194 Anne E. Goldman of the speaker's story, and to obscure the narrative frame of what is, as the title page reminds us, a joint labor. Perhaps most significantly, Westling's refusal to invoke the context of textual production means she must deny as well the structure of power which informs this Southern relationship. Ig- noring the way in which unequal political authority must inevita- bly inflect a collaboration between white professional and black domestic, the editor instead relies upon a picture of intimacy: "We have known each other for 30 years, ever since she began working for my mother once a week when I was 14" (xi). That this "close relationship," which she affirms is "typical of Mrs. Rice's associa- tions with families in which she has worked" (xi) may be defined differently by employer and employee does not figure here. Nor does she distinguish between the intimacy of friends and that maternalism which Judith Rollins documents as characteristic of the relation of domestics and their employers in the American South.10 If she acknowledges that the relationship between editor and speaker has some bearing upon the text, "when we began the project, we had a rapport which made the collaboration relaxed, even as it must certainly also have limited some elements of the narration" (xi), she does not recognize that the way in which she perceives such a relation may be at least in part the function of her own vantage point as the child of a household in which Mrs. Rice worked part-time as a domestic laborer, and that this perspective may not necessarily be shared by this employee herself. 4. "How we led good lives": Alternative Models of Life History To isolate Mrs. Babb's role as a faith healer is a distortion not only of the way she perceives herself but also of the way in which she is perceived by the outside observer, who in this case was myself. . . . To me, she is primarily a strong, yet compassionate, woman, able to be at home in a desert envi- ronment that most of us would consider at best unfriendly, at worst unlivable. In recounting her story, she gave at least as much emphasis to her trials and tribulations as a young bride and mother as to the manifestations of healing abilities and spirit helpers.... However, Mrs. Babb's role as faith healer</page><page sequence="19">Is That What She Said? 195 held a great degree of interest for me, and for that reason I urged her on in that area while I might not have urged her in others. (Babb 104-05) Notwithstanding the respects in which I am a Southerner, I tended to operate with a Northerner's "sociologism" about the South, that is, with an abstract schema lacking the texture of lived lives. By contrast, my grandmother dealt in actual people and places, in the choices that she or her neighbor confronted, in what a man or woman did given a particular circumstance. Aggregated, much of this could become the events and processes so dear to social scientists, but my grand- mother was telling me about experience before it became either. (Fields xix-xx) I have critiqued the tendency of some recent life histories to exploit an individual life in order to dramatize an editorial thesis about culture." Yet politically sophisticated-because they are formally sophisticated-life histories do exist, texts which ac- knowledge the autobiographical subject as the product of a rela- tion between the various people involved in the transformation of spoken memory into written reminiscence. Arnold Krupat cites Lucullus Virgil McWhorter's Yellow Wolf: His Own Story (1940) for consistently noting "shifts in tone, pauses, or changes in diction on Yellow Wolf's part, refusing to erase the inevitable gaps and fis- sures of the actual narrative event to produce the illusion of the unified, seamless textual object" (158). Further, he notes, McWhorter interrupts Yellow Wolf's monologues within the various chap- ters, to speak directly in his own voice . . . to explain that Yellow Wolf is speaking in direct response to a question McWhorter has posed, or in acknowledgement of a request to follow up some earlier matter. (157-58) This self-conscious textual practice identifying the narrative subject as constructed out of what anthropologists call "field dia- logue" is used by Pat Ellis Taylor in Border Healing Woman as well, allowing us insight into the way in which the relation between speaker and editor is narratively inscribed. While Taylor places a</page><page sequence="20">196 Anne E. Goldman high value on "preserv[ing] . . . Mrs. Babb's unique 'voice,"' ed- iting "as little as possible, other than to arrange the spoken and written segments in orderly sequence" (xvi), she intersperses be- tween portions of the speaker's narrative her own "impressions of the time I spent with her and of the environment which, in my opinion, has contributed to the formation of her personality and her beliefs" (xvi). Within the context of the text as a whole, it is clear, such editorial intercession tends to position the speaker as specimen subject rather than coauthority, upon which a scholarly apparatus of preface, afterword, and endnotes will be brought to bear. End- notes in particular are most crucial to this process: as the final word, they provide an authoritative reading of Mrs. Babb's nar- rative, establishing two levels of interpretation in the text. Thus the speaker's explanations, many organized under the ethnolog- ical rubric of folk tales (see in particular the "stories," bracketed with titles like "The Light That Saved The Beggar's Life" and "The Man Who Could See Into Another Life" at the close of chapter 6, "Changing Circumstances"), become "raw data" to be glossed by the editor's notes in a series of "scientific" affirmations, elaborations, and negations. In addition, the notes mark specific passages of the text as direct transcription from tape but fail to indicate which portions of the narrative are in fact reproduced- with or without editorial intervention-from Mrs. Babb's written recollections. Taylor's uneven description of textual mechanics makes it difficult to perceive to what extent she has rewritten those portions of Mrs. Babb's reminiscences which are not directly tagged as transcriptions. Nevertheless, her insistence on the text as the product of dialogue clearly affirms the life history as col- laborative process. Further, if such interjections tend to dispel the quality of voice the editor works to (re)produce, her decision to alternate chapters of Mrs. Babb's narratives with her own percep- tions of the speaker calls attention to the fact that Mrs. Babb is situated by this process as a kind of textual character. If the final product appears more Taylor's than the speaker's, such an effect at least more honestly directs readers to consider the relation between editorial author(ity) and autobiographical subject in this book. In fact, thanks to Taylor's very extensive accounting of edi-</page><page sequence="21">Is That What She Said? 197 torial practice, Border Healing Woman foregrounds the narrative tensions produced by the conflict between the speaker's own or- dering-and thus, interpretation-of her history and the manner in which her memories are reconstructed by an editor who may gloss such recollections quite differently. Taylor's "Afterword," which distinguishes specific events as particularly formative of the speaker's character, suggests how such editorial (re)evaluation ef- fectively discourages the speaker's own impulses toward self-for- mation. In discussing Jewel Babb's move from Langtry, Texas, to the hot springs near Sierra Blanca, Taylor assigns the speaker a value at odds with Mrs. Babb's own attempt to shape her history. The editor identifies the shift from urban to rural environment as "Undoubtedly . . . the major turning point in Mrs. Babb's life" (112), in that it contributes to her knowledge of healing. Yet the editor's own admission several pages before this biographical as- sessment (her own "confessed interest in her ability to heal" no doubt has led Mrs. Babb "into certain emphases on the material that she might not have chosen herself" [104]) allows us to more critically evaluate her later judgement about the subject's growth. Character descriptions like the following provide a perfect exam- ple, in addition, of the way autobiographical presencing gets over- written by the impulse to locate the speaker ethnographically: And when she left the hot springs, she was very different from the simple ranching woman who had first arrived. In the course of time, Mrs. Babb had learned as much as anyone who had ever been associated with the hot springs about how to use the mud, mosses, and waters. (115) The autobiographical subject is accorded little value, is in fact trivialized here; yet Jewel Babb's own recollections about her ranch work-her relationship with her mother-in-law, her feel- ings about the physical and emotional trials this work involves, and her assessment of the relation between this kind of labor, traditionally perceived as masculine, and her sense of herself as a woman-suggest that this "simple ranching woman" would not necessarily assess her self-formation in accordance with the model Taylor provides for her as "healing woman." The frankness with which Taylor acknowledges her own in-</page><page sequence="22">198 Anne E. Goldman terests in the text is as commendable as it is exceptional. What her comments indicate, however, is that the process of selecting a given person's life story as worthy of note is contingent on a conservative model of history, a history which situates the per- sonal record as valuable only insofar as it is monumental. Either you are a distinguished citizen whose self-formation becomes con- flated with political formation more generally (thus Benjamin Franklin's Autobiography is read as defining the American-made self, while conversely Jefferson's Notes on the State of Virginia is glossed for the insight it affords readers on the character of its author) or you attain distinction by the extent to which your par- ticular history works as a synecdoche to invoke a monumental historical force-of class formation, of racial politics, of gender conflict. This "typographical" theory of history precludes, of course, precisely what a more accretive version of history would guarantee as valuable: the study of particular lives as significant through their very particularity. In distinguishing between two quite different interpretive modes, the excerpt from Lemon Swamp with which I opened this section provides a useful outline of this alternative historical model. "I began my part of Lemon Swamp with a mental map showing historical events and processes, a map strongly colored with discrimination, violence, economic pressure, and deprivation of civil rights," Karen Fields begins, identifying her own perspec- tive as "sociological." Her grandmother, she realizes, on the other hand, "was not trying to convey 'how black people fared in Charleston over the first half of this century,' but 'how we led our lives, how we led good lives"' (xix-xx). The distinctions which Fields is drawing here between ethnographic or "sociological" dis- course and autobiographic utterance-what she defines as artic- ulating the "texture of lived lives"-are compelling for the clarity with which they outline the conflicting narrative impulses of col- laborative texts. Because her description does not privilege ab- stract modes of analysis over conceptual systems which work on the level of the concrete, Fields provides us with a way to avoid reducing autobiographic discourse to "data" upon which editorial analysis must be imposed. Instead, she points to the very signifi- cant theoretical work such recollection may produce. In remem- bering how people lived "good lives" Mamie Garvin Fields is in</page><page sequence="23">Is That What She Said? 199 fact organizing the details of experience just as would the ethnog- rapher-that is, within the rubric of an evaluative (in this case, ethical) system. Focusing on the particular, then, does not indicate the absence of an interpretive framework and thus does not re- quire the imposition of ethnographic analysis in order to be granted value. Rather, it provides readers with a means to argue the political and moral usefulness of detailing "the texture of lived lives." By contrast, the way in which the "monumental" theory of historical value operates can be seen quite clearly in Taylor's com- ments about the production of Border Healing Woman. "This book," she affirms, represents Mrs. Babb's life story and her views on her healing powers in her own words. The account which emerges of her developing consciousness as a faith healer is an exciting one, not only because of the insight it can provide on healers in general but also because of the model it presents of a strong, individualistic woman coming into her own powers without benefit of the support either husband or community would usually provide. (xvi) Ranching and goatherding and farming and healing work, mem- ories as a sister, daughter, mother, wife, granddaughter, and daughter-in-law are filtered through an editorial lens which fo- cuses on the exposition of two "abstract schemas." The editor directs us to see Mrs. Babb as a "model" of self-reliant femininity and an example of "healers in general." While Taylor is clearly interested in Mrs. Babb's story for its implications for feminist autobiography, it is the second argument which ultimately defines the speaker. And define her this argument does: by the close of the text, any self-presencing impulses which the editor has ges- tured toward in her prefatory and concluding comments have been completely obliterated. The final sentence of the book clamps down on interpretation as it effectively reduces the speaker to type: But this is sure: Mrs. Babb is a true representative of a border culture which has provided a climate for bringing traditions together .... Mrs. Jewel Babb: border healing woman-a</page><page sequence="24">200 Anne E. Goldman special breed of woman in a very special part of the world. (122) This wholehearted reassertion of editorial interpretive con- trol accords with romantic ethnography's formation of the sub- ject-as-anachronism. A "special breed," Jewel Babb is a throwback to a (fantasied) earlier age where the land and its inhabitants converse in a prelapsarian tongue quite distinct from what the academic establishment-tired of the successive linguistic es- trangements of modernism and postmodernism?-mourns as its own bloodless circulation of words. "Yuccas eight and ten feet high" nod to each other in anthropomorphic splendor "as if they were the incarnations of desert people friendly with each other and watchful of strangers" (4). Meanwhile, Mrs. Babb takes on the serenity of a desert plant; the picture of still tranquillity, she "sat in her big armchair by the window with her palms held up toward Chuck, who was sitting, relaxed, on the couch" (24). With "hay in her hair from the last feeding time of the goats at sunset" (24), she becomes the incarnation of earth mother. My own somewhat fanciful editorial imposition here may look as overdirective as Taylor's own. Hyperbolic gesture or no, however, it is difficult to ignore the nostalgic yearning for an apparently more "primitive" past which colors the narrative, a yearning which is not incidental to Taylor but which is produced whenever the discourse of ethnography is invoked to explain au- tobiographical utterance. Arnold Krupat has suggested that the primary goal of twentieth-century collaborative Indian autobiog- raphy is to allow "the scientist to express his objectivity. The first- person pronoun demonstrates his absence from the text, and so, too, demonstrates the 'objective . . . authenticity' of his account" (68). Such an argument is perhaps overstated if it is extended to cover the kinds of life histories discussed here. Krupat's descrip- tion of "academically based anthropology" as ethnographic "sal- vage" (155) nevertheless points to the way in which this kind of literary production works as a form of cultural epitaph. In Border Healing Woman, this narrative impulse is never more clear than at its close. "I would think about death, that is always just a breath away," the final paragraph begins. "Then I would turn around, and there would be the sunset. Beautiful beyond description. And</page><page sequence="25">Is That What She Said? 201 I think there will be a time I can step right off my hill and walk right up through it. And maybe I will just go away that way" (103). Such self-sentencing aligns the speaking "I" with the textualized "I" (both find closure at the same moment) to make the flesh- and-blood subject of the narrative its scripted object.12 That collaborative autobiographies which position the editor and speaker in ethnographic relation appear so consistently to undermine the speaker's attempts at self-presencing is distressing, but hardly surprising. The etymological link between the words "representation" and "representative" suggests that observation, regardless of context, must to an extent rely not only upon par- ticularization, but categorization. But if the textual apprehension of another always involves a negotiation between levels of descrip- tion, the ethnographic project favors only one end of this sliding scale of perception. Contemporary criticism often conflates the- orizing with generalizing, according "abstraction" a higher value than "specification." This impulse to provide a typology of the subject is especially fraught in ethnographic representation. All too often, the privilege of both activities is assigned to the editor, "collaboration" becoming "monopolization" of intellectual re- sources. Recognizing that an oral history is produced out of a context of political inequality does not mean that we should dismiss it, a priori, as a form of ventriloquism for the Voice of Authority, however. Clearly the conjunction of editorial and publishing in- terests works to impose its own interpretive rubric upon the me- diated text. We can acknowledge that such autobiographies oper- ate in a kind of Bakhtinian world of linguistic struggle, however, without conceding that the battle is foreclosed. That people will use the languages available to them-whatever their ideological self-positioning-should come as no surprise to anyone who has ever tried to get published. What we need to listen for, then, are those inflections which mark even what may look like the most rigidly controlled text as a place of contending forces.13 Notes 1. As with autobiographical texts more generally, defining what constitutes a life history/first-person oral account is itself a question which has produced a number of responses. Space limitations direct me to provide only one such</page><page sequence="26">202 Anne E. Goldman response here, a definition I am adopting from Bob Blauner's "Problems of Editing 'First-Person' Sociology": "I define the first-person study as any book or article in which the findings are presented predominantly directly through the narratives or accounts of interview subjects, rather than distilled through the summaries or analysis of the writer, and in which the presentation of such 'personal document' material rather than the author's point of view is considered the primary goal" (47). 2. The interviewers' extensive commentary would probably preclude Neil M. Cowan and Ruth Schwartz Cowan's Our Parents' Lives from inclusion as a "first- person" study according to Blauner's definition. Their reliance on oral inter- view, however, provides one particularly striking illustration of intraracial me- diation in which the "object" of study is situated ethnographically. See, in particular, "A Note on the Text": In order to protect the anonymity of the people we interviewed, we have changed people's names and various identifying details in their stories. In doing this, we have tried to remain both historically and demographically sensible, transforming an Isaac into an Aaron per- haps, but not into a Jason or a Lance; moving someone from Boston to Philadelphia perhaps, but not from Chicago to Paterson or New London. Further to protect anonymity, but also to assure readability, we have created composite characters: defining types of people and then merging several individual voices into one character who represents the type-a professional who was born in the United States, for example, or a factory worker who was born and lived abroad until her teens. (xxiv, emphasis added) 3. Of course this formulation needs to grant that cultural reproduction op- erates within a political system which assigns different traditions unequal values. 4. I would also note here that the writing of James Fenimore Cooper, surely the archetype for many later literary evocations of the "noble savage," images Chingachgook as an "abstraction." More generally, "Indian fortitude" in The Last of the Mohicans turns "each dark and motionless figure into stone" (341). Once again an "ethnic Other" serves as model. 5. Lejeune's own assumption here about responsibility is undercut by his earlier point about collaboration. It seems to me that there are openings in Lejeune which his own prose tends to foreclose, and it is these openings I would like to address here. 6. What I am suggesting is that we take into account how the context of feminist scholarship within which such narratives are produced tends to amplify any gesture of a particular speaker which articulates a distinctively feminine authority. While not devaluing the ways in which various speakers position themselves as women, it seems to me that feminine authority is often very clearly stated in the text because it is in the editor's-as well as the speaker's-interest to do so. 7. Thanks to Genaro Padilla for first posing this question about Lejeune's assumption here. 8. Kevin Dwyer's analysis in Moroccan Dialogues of the relation between edi- torial introduction and narrative proper in ethnographic texts provides another demonstration of the way in which such a division between "explanation" and "data" works to reassert the (anthropological) editor as solitary subject/author:</page><page sequence="27">Is That What She Said? 203 In the anecdotal account, to the contrary, anthropologist and infor- mant may both appear as subjects, but the fieldwork experience is still used to erect a barrier between Self and Other. First, the anec- dotal account is explicitly opposed to the "ethnography" and usually appears either as the introduction to the ethnography proper, or fills alone an entire volume. Here, the anthropologist's experience is sharply divided into its "personal" aspects, exemplified in anecdotal "tribulations" (as Malinowski revealingly called them) . . . and "work," which produces the "data" in which personal experience supposedly plays no role. With this opposition, the author reiterates and reinforces the immunity of the Self: the activity of the Other remains the object of anthropological "explanation" and analysis while the Self's restricted to the anecdote, is sheltered from them. (266) 9. In her discussion of Plains Indian pictographic autobiography, Hertha Wong points out that the titles of sketchbooks like "The Life of the Red-Man, Illustrated by a Kiowa Brave" and "Scenes for Indian Life, Drawn by Howling Wolf," both edited by Anglo-Americans, make clear that editorial interest lies in "depicting a generalized presentation of Indians, rather than the personal ar- tistic interpretations of individuals" (66). In this chapter ("Pictographs as Auto- biography") as well as in others, Wong's readings of Native American collabo- rative autobiography focus in suggestive ways on many of the issues discussed in this essay. 10. See especially chapter 5 of Between Women, "Deference and Maternalism," 155-203. 11. Calling attention to this dialogue between transcriber and speaker over who will control the text is useful in another way, in that it provides a metaphor for the dialogic nature of cultural authority. Just as the very attempt to hide editorial intervention points to that which it cannot wholly conceal, that is, the speaker's own exertion of agency, so efforts to write the American cultural script as a monolithic storyline of dominant vs. dying cultures indicate that which this discourse is designed to obscure: the fact that politically oppressed groups nev- ertheless insist on articulating authority via cultural practice. By pointing to the way in which an apparently fixed subjectivity is the outcome of a relation be- tween editor and speaker, such life histories remind us that the plot of cultural demise is itself produced; merely one description of the complicated relation between political power and cultural practice. 12. The death of the speaker coincides with narrative closure in Motherwit as well: "I was a good midwife. One of the best as they say. This book was the last thing I had planned to do until God said well done. I consider myself-in fact if I leave tomorrow-I've lived my life and I've lived it well" (177). 13. I am indebted to Barbara Christian's suggestive allusions to Pauline Hop- kins' 1900 novel, Contending Forces, when I invoke its title here. Works Cited Babb, Jewel.
