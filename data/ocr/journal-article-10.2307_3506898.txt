On the same page, Parker received in 1667 the rectory of Chartham, not Chatham (in the same county). The 'J.D.' who printed the 'Second Impression' of the first part was, no doubt, John Darby the 'Religious Printer'. But he ought not to be confused with the John Darby who appeared before Henry Coventry in January I672/3. The highly inaccurate tran- script of Coventry's minutes in the fourth H.M.C. Report (p. 234) is admittedly ambiguous; but it seems pretty certain from the original notes (Coventry Papers at Longleat, Volume xi, folio o) that the Darby concerned is another man: Jan 24 John Darbys wife saith, that in december last her husband being Constable went with Mr Lestranges man &amp; Mr Ponder to the house of Winter a Printer in Cock Lane in an alley neare Sepulchres Church, and there seized upon some sheets of a book called the Rehearsall Transprosed which were printed by the said Winter Jone Darby. It follows from this that the 1500 copies that Darby said were to be printed were of John Winter's pirated 'Second Edition Corrected', and not, as Mr Smith supposes (footnote to page xxiii), of the authorized 'Second Impression'. A smaller, but vexing, oversight occurs in the list of L'Estrange's censorial deletions (p. xxiv). These are identified only by reference to the page-numbers of the first edition, and are therefore virtually impossible to find in the present text, which contains no record of the original pagination. Almost a hundred years separate Grosart's edition from the present one. During that time, Marvell's prose has not enjoyed a small part of the critical atten- tion given to his verse; and no doubt the judgement of history is sound in this respect. It is a pity, all the same, that Mr Smith did not find room in his Introduc- tion to say something of the literary merits of The Rehearsal Transpros'd; of the wit, the careful objectivity, the persistent irony and fundamental seriousness; of, above all, the really remarkable command of a civilized and ingratiating tone of voice, all of which suggest comparison with similar qualities in the poems. Something might have been said, too, of the book's reputation and critical reception (we have a good deal of evidence of this), and of its contribution to the charac- teristic manner and posture of Restoration prose-writing. Perhaps this edition will invite others to give these things their attention. It ought no longer to be possible to dismiss the book, as the OxJord History of English Literature did quite recently (Volume v (Oxford, I965), p. 341), as 'rambling, shapeless, and often trivial and irrelevant'. Mr Smith has at any rate given us, more reliably than anyone before him, the materials to disprove that. . L. A. DAVIES BIRMINGHAM The Resolved Soul: A Study of Marvell's Major Poems. By ANN EVANS BERTHOFF. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press; London: Oxford University Press. xiv + 243 pp. C3.60. It has become a commonplace that most recent commentary on Marvell's poetry is unhelpful, pretentious, and absurd. Mrs Berthoff's volume would seem to give no cause to revise that view. Her book might have been written in ignorance of the caustic surveys by Professor Legouis (in RES, New Series 8 (1957), 382-9) and Professor Kermode (in Encounter, 27, No. 5 (November 1966), 77-84). 'Would seem' is a necessary qualification, however, since it is not always possible to under- stand what Mrs Berthoff is writing. A practitioner of the higher illiteracy, her</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 289 prose is a patchwork of polysyllables, pregnant yet undelivering metaphors, and simple affectation: 'Marvell contemplates the green world of time'; 'Marvell throughout his poetry confronts with resolute imagination the absolute contingency of freedom and necessity, transformingthatphilosophical conception into the drama, the "story", of the Resolved Soul'; 'Narration is an expressive form answering to the temporality of experience; emblem gives voice momentarily to the abstract. In Marvell's poems, the created picture is resonant with the history it bespeaks and the unfolding story discovers significance in the world of time'; 'Discord is absent, because since Silvio's betrayal the Nymph has lived entirely in the present, from day to day - that is, virtually out of time'; 'Emblematic seeing is the intaglio of prophetic judgment: the Puritan imagination, it is well to remember, is an allegorical imagination'. Beneath these obfuscations, much of the book is platitudinous paraphrase of the poems - like this comment on the last stanza of 'Upon Appleton House': Like the starry cattle and the halycon-Maria, like the square grown spherical and the river-snake, the great prelate of the grove and the mariners of the hayfields, like all the masquers of this afternoon's pageant, these fishermen are caught in a metamorphosis which is the creation of the transforming eye of imagination. The visionary poet sees in the picture of a salmon-fisher with his boat over his head an image of the earth and its heaven: the correspondence excites amusement and wonder and delight because it is beautiful and true. (p. I93) Mrs Berthoff's manner, however, purports to express theory and analysis, not simple description. Her opening chapter argues against the 'literalizing' of those who see in the phrase 'This Dial new' in 'The Garden' a specific visual and horticul- tural reference to a floral sundial: 'If the rhetorical character of "this Dial new" is understood, it will be no more visualized than "the Garlands of repose". ' Similarly she chides those like Margoliouth who see specific and architectural references in the opening stanzas of 'Upon Appleton House': 'But cogency does not depend on our having a visual image of Appleton House in mind. The "Square grows Spherical" probably derives not from the architectural details of Appleton House but from the implicit suggestions of the metaphor of the anthropomorphic house, which in turn is based not upon appearance but upon idea.' The implications of Mrs Berthoff's approach come out most clearly in her treatment of 'Upon Appleton House' where her concern to remove any contemporary political application from the poem is intransigently at odds with its manner and content: 'The best argument against the labored allegorization of the harvest/battle is that we do not need it and that, if allowed, it disrupts the poem.' Some of the book's most radical points are made in such brief, unargued statements. With happy surety we are told, 'Marvell does not return to the theme of the soldier's retirement. His purpose is neither to justify nor, of course, to question explicitly his employer's choice, but to describe the circum- stances of its enactment and its moral consequences. Ironic speculation about the safety of retreat, the loss of heroic leadership and the chance of earthly glory this is nothing to Marvell's larger purpose. He honors the private person, whose choice he does not question.' To ask for argued substantiation of such assertions, however, would be to take The Resolved Soul too seriously.
