<plain_text><page sequence="1">Le Problème de Dieu, by Edouard Le Roy, membre de l'Institut, Pro fesseur au Collège de France. (L'Artisan du Livre, Paris, 1929.) The work is made up of two parts, which are different both in origin and in style. The first part is a philosophical statement of the general aspect of the problem, especially of its difficulties, and of the direction in which the solution of them is to be sought. The second is a popular presentation, what the author calls a spiritual meditation rather than a learned discussion. The first was originally published in the Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale, and is somewhat in the nature of a treatise ; the second was a series of lectures given several times to popular audiences, and the form of this kind of address has not been altered. Yet there is the unity of question and answer, as may be seen from the titles. The first is Comment se pose le Problème de Dieu ; the second is Le Chemin vers Dieu. Both are said to be parts of a larger systematic treatise in preparation. The form as well as the substance makes plain the author's mind. The raising of difficulties is a philosophical question, yet the answer is not in abstract argument but in life, and there is no answer apart from living religion. The classical proofs are discussed as arguments drawn from (a) the</page><page sequence="2">2l8 the journal of theological studies physical world, (b) the moral world, and (c) the pure reason. None of them hold as compulsory logical reasoning, yet, granting a religious outlook, they all present right contentions. Yet no living faith ever sprang from argument, and the real task is to discover how it springs from life and to judge its developement according to life's right activities. A God who is a necessity of reason would not be God, and, if He is to be known, it can only be as an experience implied in the experience of life itself. The task is to restore the intuitions, which the old arguments express, to their sphere in experience and to revivify them with the concrete and practical reality. As mere static argument, how ever, they are made worthless by progress. The problem backwards is not to a beginning in time, for there may be none, but concerns the root of all being, not the origin of all, but all as origin ; and, forwards, it is not rounded perfection, but infinity of progress. When this is seen, we also see that no one who really believes in any higher good for which he has still to live really disbelieves in God. The difficulty does not concern the mere existence of God, but how we are to know what is above all our knowing, yet can have no meaning if it merely transcends all our experience. The difficulty especially applies to per sonality. A non-personal God is not a religious faith, but no definition of personality escapes anthropomorphism. All we can say is that God is such in Himself that He should be treated by us as a person, which means that He is for us the centre of duties and the subject of rights. 'To face in every order toward the better, to believe speculatively and practically in what is beyond all, and, with all one's soul, to seek it, to tend in consequence to surpass all finite realization in the sense of increasing perfection—that is to affirm God,' The whole work might be summed up by saying that the philosophical basis is Bergson and the religious Pascal. Bergson has shewn that we do not prove a concrete reality but perceive it. But his élan vital has now become more definitely thought in action, and this is interpreted by Pascal's view of man's infinite aspiration and infinite need, now, how ever, referred to what lies before him and not to what lies behind. Ά persistent unrest, an infinite aspiration, the assurance that there is always more than the present, the vital effort to attain this more : that at its source is essentially faith in God.' It is the solution of a problem of life rather than of knowledge. Each of us is born into a current of affirmation, issuing from the most remote ages and embodied in institu tions, ideas, sentiments, which informs and inspires. This is true as it is age-long experience, and it is tested as it has living meaning for us, which it can have only as we contribute to it. The proof is that the faith does not dissolve under the criticism of life, but is of inexhaustible and during fertility.</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 219 The second part works out this answer in detail, in dependence mainly on the interpretation of Pascal by Bergson and of Bergson by Pascal. The most original part of the work concerns what is called La volonté profonde, the deeper intent which determines, in contrast to mere balancing of pains and pleasures, the real conduct of life. I am still not much clearer about Bergson's view of matter and spirit as expounded by M. Le Roy than when expounded by Bergson himself. But the book as a whole is an admirable piece of clear thinking, lucidly, attractively, and forcibly presented. To some readers the latter part may be a little too eloquent, but that it has gained its end of winning a general audience appears from this, that, though the preface is dated Feb. nth, 1929, this copy is marked 6e edition.
