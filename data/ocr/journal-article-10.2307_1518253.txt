It is also surprising that no detailed comparison is undertaken with the law of the king in Deut. xvii 14-20. Moreover, the English style of the author is often bizarre (e.g. "enfleshed", p. 43; "vehiculed", p. 45; the use of "adumbrating" with the apparent meaning of "damaging", p. 49; "capsuliz- ed", p. 203). Nevertheless, she has succeeded in drawing attention to an im- portant passage in the DtrH and in suggesting a fresh appreciation of its literary function in the composition as a whole. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] M. L. KLEIN, Anthropomorphisms and Anthropopathisms in the Targumim of the Pentateuch, with Parallel Citations from the Septuagint. xxvi (English) + 176 (Hebrew) pp. Makor Publishing Ltd, Jerusalem, 1982. It is frequently stated as a generalization that the Targumim avoid or tone down anthropomorphisms. In his doctoral dissertation, presented in 1978 to the Hebrew University and here published with the provision of an index of references and an up-to-date bibliography, Klein examines the origins and moder expressions of this view before subjecting it to analysis and common-sense criticism. It is shown that the Targumim are in no way consistent in their translations, and that more often than not we must reckon with general translation equivalents rather than specifically anti-anthropomorphic renderings. Amongst other relevant topics covered we should note here, in view of various recent publications, the salutary remarks about the inconsistent use of memra' in the Targumim. Instead of an English summary, two of Klein's articles in English (SVT 32 [1981], pp. 162-77, andJTS, N.S. 30 [1979], pp. 502-7) are included. Between them, they discuss in brief compass most of the areas covered by the dissertation, but not, we may note, the rendering of anthropomorphic and anthropopathic verbs at- tributed to God, where Klein's generally convincing thesis is most open to criticism. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] R. W. KLEIN, 1 Samuel. Word Biblical Commentary 10. xxxiv + 307 pp. Word Books, Waco, Texas, 1983. After a list of abbreviations, a general bibliography, and an introduction of little more than twelve pages, the com- mentary follows the usual pattern of the series, and there are indexes of authors, principal subjects, and biblical references, but unfortunately no maps. Klein is well informed and writes clearly, and the commentary is generally helpful and, among other things, takes textual evidence from Qumran into con- sideration. The reader would sometimes have welcomed more information (e.g. a discussion of the phrase "Yahweh of hosts" in i 3, and the meaning of miptan in v 4-5, and a fuller discussion of "seer" and "prophet" in ix 9 and of the im- plications of the command to "serve other gods" in xxvi 19), and sometimes references are made to philological matters and cognate languages without stating precisely what the relevant information is (pp. 32, 50, 175; cp. p. 232). One wonders whether the author was allowed enough space to meet the needs of exegesis. The commentary is readable, though there are places where the English is in need of polish or even correction (e.g. "decimation" seems to be used as a synonym of "massacre" on pp. 27, 108, and "transpired" as a synonym of "happened" on p. 224; "data... is", p. 35; "Saul was very angry with Michal, as he would be with Jonathan, his other son", p. 198; Jonathan is described as "presumptive heir" of Saul on pp. 199, 210-or is the phrase in- tended to have a different meaning from "heir presumptive"?). Notwithstan- ding such blemishes, the commentary deserves to be widely used. J.A.E.] G. A. F. KNIGHT, Servant Theology. A Commentary on the Book of Isaiah 40-55.
