Zool., 30:897-906 (1990) The Evolution of Integration of Biological Systems: An Evolutionary Perspective through Studies on Cells, Tissues, and Organs1 Marvalee H. Wake Department of Integrative Biology and Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, California 94720 Synopsis. Biologists are integrating studies of morphology, development, physiology, and other disciplines in order to understand how species and lineages diversify and cope with their environments. An evolutionary perspective in such studies, including those of cells, tissues, and organs, is potentially useful for the structure and analysis of such prob? lems. Evolutionary biology is the study of the history of evolution and the elucidation of its mechanisms. Comparative biology is the comparison of a trait or traits in selected taxa, and may be, but need not be, evolutionary in approach. A phylogenetic hypothesis is necessary for reconstruction of pattern in morphology, ecology, behavior, and other areas. Acquaintance with evolutionary and phylogenetic perspectives can guide selection of taxa for study and open new approaches to analysis of data. Such an approach is not always appropriate to problems in biology, but it could be utilized beneficially more frequently than is currently practiced. Studies of cells, tissues, and organs may contribute to the construction of new phylogenetic hypotheses and to analysis of patterns and mechanisms of change when pursued from an evolutionary perspective. Introduction Recent years have seen an explosion of literature that considers the integration of biological systems, often from an evolu? tionary perspective. Biologists are seeking to integrate studies of morphology, devel? opment, physiology, ecology, systematics, and behavior in order to understand how species and lineages deal with their envi? ronments and how they have diversified. Several exemplary studies have focused on the integration of morphology and physi? ology to examine biological performance in feeding or locomotion, and others on the heritability and selection of compo? nents of morphology and physiology. Biol? ogists have considered aspects of early and late development to see how genetic and epigenetic phenomena interact to produce morphologies and physiologies. Some of these studies focus on a single species, oth? ers are more broadly comparative. Most of them examine how complex organisms are integrated at several levels of study?the behavior and morphology of cells, the physiological capacities of tissues and 1 From the Plenary Session on Organisms as Inte? grated Systems: Cells, Tissues, and Organs presented at the Centennial Meeting of the American Society of Zoologists, 27-30 December 1989, at Boston, Mas? sachusetts. organs, and the structure and function of the organism. An evolutionary perspective is not intrinsic to investigation of the inte? gration of complex organisms, but inquiry often benefits from such a framework. I will elucidate the evolutionary per? spective by presenting two examples of studies of the evolution of integrated sys? tems that explore at several hierarchical levels in an evolutionary context. I will explore the way an evolutionary perspec? tive can work, by considering the distinc- tions between evolutionary biology and comparative biology, and among phylo- genetics, systematics, and taxonomy. I will consider when an evolutionary perspective on the structure and analysis of problems might be useful, and when it might not. I will conclude by suggesting why one should adopt an evolutionary perspective more often than now occurs. What Is an Evolutionary Perspective? How Does It Apply to the Study of Cells, Tissues, and Organs? Futuyma (1986) states that evolutionary biology consists of two principal endeav- ors: inferring the history of evolution and elucidating its mechanisms. Studies of cells, tissues, and particularly organs have con- tributed greatly to these endeavors by pro- viding data and analysis at several levels of 897</page><page sequence="2">898 Marvalee H. Wake organization in many diverse taxa. The techniques and technology developed for such studies, most recently at the cellular and sub-cellular levels, are being utilized by evolutionary biologists as well as by physiologists, developmentalists, and other organismal biologists. However, though techniques and data are so employed, I sug? gest that the evolutionary perspective has contributed less to studies of cells and organs than have the data on cells and organs influenced evolutionary biology. I will consider some of the reasons for this, and ways that an evolutionary perspective might be useful and important in studies of cells, tissues, and organs. In general, an evolutionary perspective includes assessing structure, function, and/ or development in terms of modifications or similarities among related species within the framework of the ancestor-descendant relationships of the lineage investigated. Comparative biology is a necessary but not sufficient component of "evolutionary" studies. Research that has an evolutionary perspective indeed can focus on individual levels of organization or on individual species, if the investigator lays out the problem within a contextual understand? ing of the lineage and the patterns of asso? ciation being investigated. Lineages are hierarchical, and the position of the taxon and the problem must be stated explicitly. Examples of Studies of the Evolution of Integrated Systems Two examples of very different sorts of cases that I consider good studies of the evolution of integrated systems are drawn from reproductive biology, emphasizing the evolution of viviparity (maintenance of developing embryos in the body ofthe par- ent, in this case with the provision of nutri- tive material after yolk is exhausted), and from functional morphology, dealing with the evolution of locomotor stamina in tet? rapods. John P. Wourms and several of his for? mer and current students explore the evo? lution of viviparity in fishes. There is a strong phylogenetic component to fish viviparity, with its occurrence largely restricted to certain genera, families, and orders of both chondrichthyans and osteichthyans (Wourms, 1977, 1981; Wourms et al, 1988). The evolution of viviparity has been examined in detail through investigation of both the maternal and the embryonic/fetal modifications associated with viviparity in representa- tives of genera, families, and orders. The researchers begin with certain assumptions about the polarity, or direction of change, of certain features, so that both phyloge? netic relationships and evolutionary trends can be assessed. Oviparity (egg laying) is primitive, viviparity derived; modifications of maternal and fetal morphology and physiology that facilitate viviparity are therefore derived; reduced yolk is a derived feature correlated with viviparity, etc. They then can analyze the modifications (adap? tations) for viviparity both within and among species and lineages. An example of this approach is the study of a specialized placental analogue in a fam? ily (Goodeidae) of viviparous teleosts. Three papers by Lombardi and Wourms (1985a, b, c) published in the Journal of Morphology and the Journal of Experi? mental Zoology examine the ultrastruc- ture of the maternal ovarian epithelium (development in viviparous teleosts occurs in the ovarian lumen or in the follicles of the ovary), the trophotaeniae ofthe embryo (long ribbon-like extensions ofthe hindgut epithelium composed of a vascularized core of loose connective tissue with an epithelial sheath), and protein uptake by the tropho? taeniae, respectively. During gestation, the maternal ovarian epithelium becomes thickened, folded, highly vascularized and secretory; it is presumed that the secretory products are important in embryonic nutrition. The trophotaeniae establish a placental-like association with the ovarian epihthelium. The protein presumed to be secreted must cross six tissue layers in order to reach the circulatory system of the embryos. Horseradish peroxidase was used as a tracer for the study of protein uptake and degradation. Ultrastructure of tropho- taenial absorptive cells shows that HRP is taken up by micropinocytosis and degraded by lysosomes. HRP is transported from the</page><page sequence="3">Evolutionary and Comparative Biology 899 apical cell surface via endocytotic vesicles into a canalicular system, then to collecting vesicles. Ten min after exposure, HRP is detected in supranuclear lysosomes. Three hours after a one hr exposure to HRP, peroxidase activity in the lysosomes is no longer detected. There is ultrastructural evidence that products of protein hydroly? sis are discharged across cell surfaces into the trophotaenial circulation. HRP is degraded when trophotaeniae are present, but not when they have been removed. Therefore protein does not appear to enter the embryo other than through the tro? photaeniae. The authors conclude that this is consistent with the putative role of tro? photaeniae as placental analogues in goo- deid fishes, and that uptake of maternally secreted nutrients accounts for the 15,000% increase in embryonic dry weight during gestation. The authors propose a model for epithelial secretion and embry? onic uptake, degradation, and transport of protein. The authors and their colleagues are extending their studies to other species and are utilizing a diversity of techniques to examine the chemistry ofthe purported nutrient material, its uptake and degra? dation, and the development of the embryos. Other workers are investigating the endocrinology of fish viviparity. This investigation of viviparity is an example of study of the evolution of inte? gration of biological systems that facilitates a significant mode of reproductive biology. I single it out because it involves selection of diverse techniques drawn from several fields of biology, it explores several asso? ciated dimensions of a problem, including mechanism of action and of evolution, and it delineates a model that provides the basis for testing hypotheses of structure and function, and its extension to other taxa. Some functional morphologists have investigated problems of the evolution of structure and function in the framework of an explicit phylogenetic hypothesis. This approach is still not common, but is increasing. An excellent example of the utility and ingenuity of such an orientation is the work of David Carrier on the evo? lution of locomotion in tetrapods. In a beautifully crafted study published in Paleobiology in 1987, Carrier examined the dramatic difference in ability to sustain vigorous locomotion between endotherms and ectotherms. Working in an historical perspective from a phylogenetic hypothe? sis of higher systematic categories of amniotes (Synapsida (Testudines (Lepido- sauromorpha (Rhynchosauria (Crocodilo- morpha (Pterosauria (Ornithischia (Sau- ropodomorpha (Carnosauria (Aves)))))))))), he postulated that evidence of locomotor and respiratory function in both fossil and modern tetrapods would provide tests and inferences about the evolution of those sys? tems. Locomotor and respiratory systems may have been anatomically linked in early tetrapods, providing a mechanical con? straint that was a consequence of the aquatic to terrestrial transition of verte? brates. Early amphibians had dermal armor, large ribs, and much muscle attached to the ribs so that the body wall was relatively stiff and heavy. Early tetra? pods probably used a thoracic pump mech? anism; thus, the musculo-skeletal system of the trunk was involved in both locomotion and lung ventilation. This functional cou- pling imposed a constraint: lateral bending during locomotion requires alternate shortening of the trunk muscles on each side; aspiration involves synchronous movement of the ribs on both sides of the trunk. Accordingly, simultaneous breath? ing and locomotion are not possible in either ancestral tetrapods or their descen- dants that retain the coupling. Lateral bending likely does not change signifi? cantly the thoracic volume because con? traction on one side would reduce volume on that side, but allow expansion of the lung on the other side. Finally, sprawling posture also limits breathing during loco? motion because ofthe lateral limb displace? ment that gives a large lateral component to the propulsive force of the gait. The lateral component during locomotion must be resisted by stiffening the trunk, further interfering with lung ventilation. One cannot know whether ancestral tet? rapods could breathe while they walked, so Carrier looked to modern lizards that resemble the presumed ancestral mor? phology in order to test the model of con-</page><page sequence="4">900 Marvalee H. Wake straint of locomotor-ventilatory coupling. Lizards were studied by simultaneously measuring amplitude of inspiratory air flow, contact pattern of one rear foot (loco? motor cycle), and locomotor speed as the animal tripped a series of equally spaced photocells. Locomotor movements are temporally correlated with reduction in lung ventilation. The data suggest that the aquatic-terrestrial transition entailed a major reduction in locomotor stamina because the mechanical constraint on simultaneous locomotion and breathing would have limited aerobic metabolism, resulting in dependence on anaerobic gly? colysis, with concomitantly decreased per? formance and rapid fatigue. Carrier inves? tigated this hypothesis by examining metabolic physiology, morphological orga? nization, and ventilatory and locomotor behavior of fast-running lizards that have limited lung ventilation and use anaerobic metabolism for bursts of activity, and the data support the hypothesis. Carrier also analyzed the origins of the ability to breathe during vigorous loco? motion in tetrapods. He summarized evi? dence from the literature that several groups (crocodilians, mammals, birds) developed ventilatory muscles, particularly a diaphragm, that are independent of the actions ofthe trunk musculature. The non- homologous, morphologically distinct dia- phragmatic muscles of mammals and croc? odiles are major inspiratory muscles; the doubtfully homologous but equally ana? tomically different muscles of birds relative to crocodiles are expiratory in function. Several anatomical modifications are cor? related with evolution from sprawling to more upright posture. They facilitate breathing during locomotion, which in turn allows increased aerobic capacity to sup? port sustained activity. Several workers have suggested that increased aerobic capacity was the principal factor in the evo? lution of endothermy. Also, bounding locomotion, a consequence of more upright posture which has little lateral torque, and bipedality facilitate bilateral lung filling and compression during running. So, if both endothermy and upright posture are responses to selection for increased stam- ina, locomotor posture might be an indi? cator ofthe metabolic physiology of extinct species. Modifications that facilitate simul- taneous locomotion and breathing support the hypothesis that several non-mamma- lian therapsids, pterosaurs, and dinosaurs were endothermic. Carrier mapped seven character states that emerged from his analysis (endothermy, bounding locomo? tion, diaphragmatic muscles, large trans- verse processes, bipedal locomotion, upright posture, lateral stability ofthe ver- tebral column) on the phylogenetic tree of major tetrapod groups in order to examine the pattern of evolution of the reduction ofthe constraint ofthe coupled locomotor- ventilatory pattern. Lineages that gave rise to modern ectothermic tetrapods retained the morphological constraint on simulta- neous locomotion and breathing, and therefore had poor stamina; many Recent ectotherms have specialized for burst activ? ity or evolved more passive modes of defense. Early reptiles also likely retained the constraint and had poor stamina, but extinct advanced reptiles in several lin? eages had derived anatomical features that indicate that they had circumvented the morphological constraint, and they likely had sustained rapid locomotion and may have been endothermic. The functional complex of musculo-skeletal features and endothermy arose independently in clades of Synapsida and Diapsida. Carrier is pursuing this work along sev? eral avenues, investigating the functional morphology and physiology of locomotion and ventilation at the cell, tissue, and organ levels in amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals in order to study the evolution of these structure-function relationships in tetrapod lineages. His work is an excellent example of the employment of diverse techniques on several well-chosen taxa in order to examine the integration of bio? logical systems. The analysis facilitates the generation of new hypotheses about struc? ture and function, and ways of testing them. It demonstrates the utility of the phylo? genetic framework for such studies because data derived from extant organisms can be used to assess the evolution of structure and function in lineages that include extinct</page><page sequence="5">Evolutionary and Comparative Biology 901 ancestors and their descendants, extinct terminal taxa, and extant taxa. Evolutionary Biology and Comparative Biology There is a distinction, to my mind, between evolutionary biology and com? parative biology, despite the discussions of some recent workers (see below). Evolu? tionary biology operates in the historical context, and may utilize data from a diver? sity of sources (morphology, biochemistry, immunology, physiology, ecology, behav? ior) in order to determine the history of lineages and mechanisms of change. Eval- uation of history and of change requires elements of comparative biology, because change is assessed by comparison and his? tory is determined by analysis of structure and function of ancestors and descendants. Several workers recently have discussed comparative biology. Ridley (1983) states that comparative biology has two princi? ples: design and history, or adaptation and phylogeny, to explain the diversity of life. However, he criticizes comparative biol? ogy for lacking soundly based formal tech? niques. He says that the problem of the comparative method is that it lacks rec? ognition of independent trials of an hypothesis, so that formal statistical tech? niques can be applied. He comments that the comparative method (undefined) did not change from Aristotle's use in 350 BC until 1950, presumably when the search for formalization ensued. Futuyma (1986) comments that Darwin introduced the comparative method. Futuyma defines the method as a means of correlating differ? ences among species with ecological fac? tors, so that inferences of fitness may be made. This too is a definition in an evo? lutionary context, not one of 'pure' com? parative biology. Rieppel (1987) is enthu- siastic about the revival of comparative biology, which he attributes to new exper? imental techniques in functional morphol? ogy and the renaissance in systematic and evolutionary biology. He recognizes three "antitheses" in comparative biology? holism and atomism, form and function, and hierarchies and continuity. For exam? ple, he considers that the study of hierar- chies emphasizes the distinctiveness of sub- ordinated levels of complexity, while continuity is the expression of similarity or a common denominator. I do not see how the holist can be truly holistic without the contributions of the atomist or reduction? ist, so I am concerned about dichotomies. However, Rieppel reconciles these antitheses as two different ways of seeing; they are complementary approaches and neither is sufficient to produce a complete explanation of natural phenomena. Com? parative biology, then, is a matter of per- ception as well as of practice, determined by the question being asked and the prob? lem being investigated. However, comparative biology, as I indi? cated above, is not necessarily evolutionary biology. Comparative biology is just that? the comparison of aspects of the mor? phology, or physiology, or behavior, etc, of minimally two taxa. Bartholomew (1987) states that one does comparisons in studies of diversity because comparison is essential to establishing relations between and among phenomena and thus escaping the chaos of unordered detail. He values the comparative method, in contrast to Ridley, because it is not technique or taxon depen? dent, but he notes that it requires appro? priate selection of technique and taxa. One can evaluate similarities and differences. If a phylogenetic hypothesis is adopted, an assessment of homology, analogy, and homoplasy (convergence, parallelism, reversal) can be made. Evaluation of homology, for example, might consider hormone structure, musculo-skeletal com- plexes, or behavior. A concept that might be useful here is that of taxic versus trans- formational homology. The taxic approach specifies a hierarchy of groups of organ? isms. The transformational approach does not specify a hierarchy and is not neces? sarily evolutionary (Patterson, 1982). It deals with archetypes. Goethe's argument that the vertebrate skull is the result of transformation of vertebral segmentation is an example of this approach. No hier? archy of groups is implied; a transforma? tion of a trait or traits, or of an archetype, is indicated. If the question requires an analysis of</page><page sequence="6">902 Marvalee H. Wake change or adaptation, i.e., evolution, an hypothesis can be formulated and tested. Multiple taxa can be examined in order to determine the generality or pattern of structure-function relationships. These are not new ideas?such master comparative biologists as D. Dwight Davis (1939, 1964) and Carl Gans (1969, 1974, 1985) have expressed similar views. George Bartho? lomew (1987) noted that species compari? sons can, and should, provide much more than an encylopaedic compilation of diver? sity of form and function; they should be an integral part of the process of assessing the generality of adaptive patterns. His examples dealt with adaptations for life in desert environments and for flight. The study of adaptation, and particularly of convergence, is made more explicit by examination of multiple taxa (Gans, 1969, 1974). Various workers have developed approaches that incorporate elements of these ideas in recent years. As one exam? ple, Lauder and Liem (1989) formalized a methodology for elucidating and analyzing novelties in evolutionary biology. I suggest that it can be broadened to other kinds of studies in evolutionary biology, including structure-function relationships, behavior, etc. The methodology includes six steps: 1?define the morphological novelty; 2? define the model; 3?phylogenetic analy? sis; 4?sample ingroup and outgroup taxa; 5?statistical analysis; 6?test the general hypothesis in other clades. This formaliza- tion of the approach intuitively used by several recent workers in diverse areas of comparative and evolutionary biology pro? vides a very useful starting-point for the structure of certain kinds of investigation, though all ofthe steps and their order may not be necessary or even possible. Comparisons do not necessarily yield information about the evolution of struc? ture or function. For example, comparison may not reveal the polarity or direction of a change. Also, one often sees in the lit? erature a tendency to assume that greater complexity of an element or a process is derived, and the simpler state is primitive. When examined in the context of a phy? logenetic hypothesis, this may not be the case. Further, comparisons may be made of taxa so distantly related that "evolu? tion" is not a logical conclusion ofthe anal? ysis. For example, comparison of the early development of Xenopus and the axolotl is very productive in terms of elucidating dif? ferences in pattern and mechanism, and some generalizations at the cellular level. Study of either one of these species inde- pendently produces invaluable data; but comparing development in these two taxa says relatively little about the evolution of development in amphibians or in verte? brates because analysis of the two taxa allows little generalization in a hierarchical sense. In order for comparative biology to facilitate conclusions about evolution of a lineage or mechanism, it must include at minimum a three-taxon comparison. The relativity of similarity or difference in com? parison of two taxa is in the eye of the beholder. If a lungfish and a cow were com? pared by someone who knew nothing of animals, they might be construed as very similar (they are animals, relative to plants) or very different (relative to other fish or other mammals). Too frequently biologists examine two taxa and declare a pattern of evolution. They often are judging their data based on only the two, or more often against an unexpressed knowledge, or set of assumptions, of the data for other groups. The main point that I wish to make, though, with these comments about the distinction between evolutionary and com? parative biology is that comparative biol? ogy is productive and useful in its own right. Comparisons need not have an evolution? ary perspective to have significance. Other kinds of comparative studies use analogy to seek generality. Robert Full does comparative physiology of locomotion using a great diversity of animal taxa? cockroaches, centipedes, crabs, salaman? ders, gophers, and many others (Full, 1987; Full et al, 1988, 1989). He is testing design principles, structural properties, and a number of aspects of the functional mor? phology and physiology of locomotor sys? tems. He now is extending his studies by using robotics as analogue systems for some analyses, and contributing to concepts in robotics. Full does not make the mistake</page><page sequence="7">Evolutionary and Comparative Biology 903 of labelling his conclusions as those of evo? lutionary biology when they are good examples of experimental physiology that elucidate functional principles applicable to the taxa examined. He does understand the potential contribution of his work to questions in evolutionary biology, but these are not necessarily the questions he is ask? ing. We must avoid stating that the con? clusions of good comparative biology indi? cate patterns of evolution when they do not have a phylogenetic context and when the comparisons do not allow delineations of primitive and derived states, and thereby evolutionary trends, while recognizing that they are useful as analogies. Phylogenetics, Systematics, and Taxonomy One interested in examining complexly integrated systems from a comparative perspective should have a clear under? standing of the phylogenetic relationships (if a robust hypothesis is available), and especially the current taxonomy, ofthe taxa compared. Wiley (1981) defines systemat? ics as the study of organismic diversity as that diversity is relevant to some specified kind of relationship thought to exist among populations, species, or higher taxa. Wiley points out that this is a narrower definition than that of Nelson (1970) who equates systematics with comparative biology. (I have found it striking that most recent workers who discuss comparative biology can only define it in the context of their general emphasis [morphology, physiol? ogy, systematics, etc.].) Wiley, however, notes that not all comparative biologists are systematists; his example is that one can compare the ecology of several species without practicing "systematics." Phylo? genetic systematics is an approach to systematics that attempts to recover the genealogical (historical, phylogenetic) relationships among groups of organisms and that produces classifications that reflect exactly those relationships. Wiley defines taxonomy as the theory and practice of describing the diversity of organisms and ordering the diversity in a system that con- veys relevant information about relation? ships among organisms. The distinction that I wish to draw has to do with incorporation of the evolution? ary perspective to the analysis of integrated systems. As I have indicated, an evolution? ary approach uses an historical, and when possible, a phylogenetic context. Xenopus and axolotl development patterns provide useful contrasts in order to understand some processes of development. However, some workers have suggested that by work? ing on one or both of these taxa, they are elucidating principles of amphibian devel? opment, and that such development fits somehow into a picture of vertebrate development. This is a typological and transformational approach, not a taxic, phylogenetic or evolutionary one. The phylogenetic relationship of these taxa is inclusive only at the class level, not the species level. For example, the phylogenies of families of frogs and families of sala? manders show that Xenopus and the axolotl are distantly related among amphibians. Further, some workers have treated these organisms as "primitive" and therefore revealing fundamental tetrapod, or even vertebrate, states?perhaps a product of a somewhat anthropomorphic conditioning. It must be recognized that the biologists who investigate Xenopus' phylogenetic relationships as a part of its overall biology consider it to be a highly derived and spe? cialized genus, and its pattern of develop? ment, as well as tadpole and adult mor? phology and behavior, are highly modified relative to the presumed primitive condi? tion. Similarly, the axolotl's development might be better understood in the context of its phylogenetic position and its biol? ogy?it is a highly paedomorphic taxon, and developmental processes are funda? mental to that phenomenon. I am especially concerned about scien? tists who examine a single species, say "the frog" or "the salamander," or even a few species from major groups within major groups, and then claim generality for an even larger major group. "The frog" and "the salamander" are assumed to be gen- eralizable to amphibians. It will not sur- prise some of you that this bothers me because it ignores the third order of amphibians, the gymnophiones, whose</page><page sequence="8">904 Marvalee H. Wake biology often does not fit generalizations derived from study of frogs and salaman? ders, and because it obscures an appreci- ation of the diversity and pattern within groups. Scientists should clearly state the nature and level of the problem, and not make inferences that are not well sup? ported by their data. An acquaintance with current taxonomy therefore is the responsibility of every sci? entist who works on organisms or their components. It is not often recognized, but when a worker uses a scientific name (and its use is essential to identify the organism), a taxonomic or systematic statement is being made. Often generic and speeific identities are not agreed upon by all the systematists working on taxa. When an epi- thet is used, the reader may infer that the author has taken a position on the taxo? nomic debate based on his/her data. Knowledge of current assessments of phy? logenetic relationships is also important. I have cited the Xenopus example; one of 'higher' taxa would be that ofthe status of reptiles, birds, and mammals. Cladistic analysis based on morphology and certain other characters of extant taxa only por- trays birds as the sister group of crocodiles; mammals are their nearest relative, fol? lowed by turtles, then lepidosaurs (snakes, lizards, amphisbaenians, Sphenodon) (Gau- thier et al, 1988). By this hypothesis, the ' 'Reptilia" are no longer a class of verte? brates. There are competing hypotheses, however, including those in which mam? mals and birds are sister groups, and in which mammals and turtles are in an unre- solved trichotomy. A cladogram based on evidence from recent as well as fossil forms indicates that birds and crocodiles are sis? ter groups, allied to turtles and lepidosaurs to form a higher taxon Reptilia, and mam? mals are in a distinctly separate amniote lineage. Reptilia, then, include birds, as well as a number of extinct lineages. Each of these hypotheses is, of course, called into question by various data sets, but should be borne in mind by the physiologist, behaviorist, and ecologist as well as the morphologist and systematist. In fact, new data often cause new assessments of the relationships of major groups. It had been thought, for a while, that the relationships of families of salamanders were well under? stood (Duellman and Trueb, 1986). How? ever, a phylogenetic hypothesis produced by Larson (1990) from molecular data pos- its some major re-arrangements of taxa, including earlier derivation of plethodon- tids. Data from fields other than mor? phology and biochemistry may contribute to the resolution of such controversies. When Are Evolutionary and Phylogenetic Perspectives Usefulto Biologists? I already have indicated that I do not believe that all biology must be done in an evolutionary context. There is of course immeasureable value to the reductionist approach and the single-taxon approach, both intrinsically and because of the con- tributions they can make to other areas of biology, including predictions about evo? lution. However, there are practices of biology and kinds of problems that would be served well by an assessment in terms of phylogenetic and evolutionary perspec? tives. Huey (1987) elucidates several rea? sons appropriate to comparative physiol? ogists; these reasons, and others, are appropriate to a number of areas of biol? ogy. Phylogenetic information can be used to guide the choice of taxa for comparison; phylogenies help circumvent some statis? tical problems that arise from the non- independence of species as sampling units; phylogenetic data can promote the analysis of historical patterns, and molecular-dis- tance data can be a basis for estimating rates of physiological evolution. Huey points out some of the limitations of the phylogenetic perspective: often an agreed- upon phylogeny is not available. One can? not, of course, restrict work only to taxa that are "understood" phylogenetically; this would be an inappropriate limitation, and in fact would hinder the development of phylogenetic hypotheses for such taxa. Non-systematic biologists should consider their data in terms ofthe absence ofa phy? logeny, and use those data to work with systematists to produce a phylogenetic hypothesis. Reconstructions of patterns in ecology, behavior, physiology, develop-</page><page sequence="9">Evolutionary and Comparative Biology 905 ment, etc, are only as good as the phylo? genetic hypothesis on which they are based. Workers in such fields might not be inter? ested in the phylogeny itself, but can con- tribute a great deal to its construction. One need not be a cladist, but one should be aware of new methodologies in systematics that produce phylogenetic hypotheses. Some knowledge of the taxa one chooses and the phylogenetic relationships of those taxa is the underpinning of assessment of pattern and mechanism of adaptation and change, but as Huey correctly points out, following developments in phylogenetics is not easy, because the literature is scattered, and often is contentious and filled with jar- gon. Why, Then, Take an Evolutionary Perspective if One Is not Specifically Asking Questions of the Nature of Change Among Taxa or the History of Lineages? Several reasons have already been expressed that have to do with choice of taxa to be examined, analysis of data about patterns and mechanisms of diversifica? tion, and ways of examining how organ? isms cope with their environments. Huey (1987) states that such an approach opens new directions for comparative physiolo? gists, new ways of looking at problems as well as analyzing them. I consider this important to all branches of biology. If we provide ourselves and especially our stu? dents with an acquaintance with the evo? lutionary perspective, we are equipped with an increased flexibility of approach and analysis. We retain the clear understanding that an evolutionary perspective is not nec? essary or appropriate to many kinds of problems, but it can provide new areas of hypothesis formation and interpretation of data when it is used to formulate questions and sometimes to provide an alternative framework for analysis of data. Finally, we are zoologists, working at a time when our study of living animals is questioned. In some important cases, an evolutionary perspective might reveal that we are finding ways to understand the ways animals cope with their environments, and in fact to facilitate benignly their existence in those environments so that biodiversity will be preserved, instead of abusing ani? mal subjects. I am tired of hearing that Animal Care and Use Committees have rejected protocols for studies in organis? mal and evolutionary biology that do not state relevance to the human condition because they would merely "satisfy intel? lectual curiosity." We have an intelligent public that reasons well when it is pre? sented with accurate, complete, and per- suasive data. Witness the dramatically increasing perception that biodiversity is worth protecting, and its degradation is a threat to the existence of many, many species, including our own. Disseminating appropriate informa? tion?education?is a slow process, but a necessary one. I suggest that we start with ourselves and our students, and our col? leagues. As technology and information load continue to increase at a phenomenal rate in biology, we tend to lose touch with other fields. This is at a time when we are more than ever recognizing the necessity to bridge fields, to be synthetic in our approaches. Rather than trying to force ourselves to read the literature in periph? eral fields, it is worth trying to talk to our colleagues in those fields. The literature is automatically out-of-date; our colleagues are in the process of the exploration that will be next year's literature. Making time for discussion, almost a lost art, may pro? vide exciting new approaches, syntheses, and collaborations. Cognizance of an evo? lutionary perspective may well allow us to ask more profound, far-reaching questions that clearly show why an investigation of selected animals will provide an under? standing of biology more broadly con- strued.
