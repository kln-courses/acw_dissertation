Of all the branches of traditional philosophy none has been more impoverished in recent years than the history of philosophy. Practitioners of the craft of logical dissolution are to blame. Searching for well- preserved corpses to illustrate new anatomies, they have eagerly infil- trated the sites of the past with a single purpose in mind, to analyze everything in sight. By mistaking fascinating reports on past accomplish- ments for invitations to dissect and litter, they have successfully ruined the last repository of philosophic insights. The picture left behind is one of desolation. Against this background Professor Guthrie's book - the first volume of a projected five volume study - is a reassuring event. Here is a work in the grand old tradition: broad in scope, thorough in detail, fair in judgment, trenchant in criticism, sympathetic in attitude, impressive in scholarship, urbane - a true pleasure to read. Of course Tannery and Duhem, Zeller and Gomperz, Heath and Burnet had similar talents, and were inspired by visions and ambitious of the same nature. In their time they were pioneers. But since then critical standards have changed. The old evidence has been vigorously reappraised, new philo- sophic techniques have affected our estimates, of ancient problems and the art of narrating ideas has become more restrained. Guthrie judiciously accepts these changes but independently paints his own picture. He tells us in a preliminary sketch what he intends to do. He would like to present the story of Greek philosophy from the Pre- socratics to the Neopythagoreans. He would like to do this through a re-examination of the evidence in the light of new conceptual insights. He will employ periodization, but changes in outlook reflecting changes in habits of thought will not be ignored. Similarly, the significance of recent scholarly controversies will be acknowledged but the spirit of mediation will in the end prevail and the story will go on. By way of making his position clear, Guthrie explains that he takes "philosophy" in one respect to mean something less than mythology and, in another, more than the special sciences of the Hellenistic period. For Guthrie, 270</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 271 "philosophy" expresses the pioneer concern of the Greeks with the whole of nature and man's place in it. There are seven parts in the first volume. Part I (Pp. 1-25) attempts to outline, on a broad canvas, the major accomplishments of Greek philosophy, their distinctive characteristics and their historical implica- tions. Part II (Pp. 26-38) deals with the precursors of Greek philosophic thought and their unconscious contributions to the birth of reason. Part III (Pp. 146-340) turns to the vexedly complicated problems of Pythagoras and Pythagoreans. Part V (Pp. 341-359) is a kind of appen- dix dealing with the difficulties of classifying Alcmaeon. Part VI (Pp. 360-402) tackles the seer-poet Xenophanes. Finally, Part VII (Pp. 360- 492) concludes with a superb reconstruction of Heraclitus. A most useful bibliography closes the book. Guthrie admits it is true that the forerunners of Presocratic, thought, both Greek and oriental, prepared the ground with their theogonies and piecemeal observations for later philosophy - generalization, abstraction, the grasping of the universal notion, the offering of a rational account, are purely Greek philosophical accomplishments. Thus it is the exclusive glory of Thales to have propounded the first philosophical simplification by the use of water as arche - the beginning of cosmos and its under- lying material, its physis. Through this arche old mythological associa- tions and new rational visions of the world for the first time became economically expressible. Consequently, new conceptual possibilities sud- denly opened. Anaximander's apeiron represents a bolder attempt, along the lines of Thales' discovery, and does a more comprehensive job. The first grasp of a technical idea referring to the nonobservable and indefi- nite gave him new freedom to tackle the idea of "opposites." Now the Hot and the Cold, the Dry and the Wet could be put to new uses. The particularity of phenomena could be overcome. The cosmos as a whole could be understood rationally through its dependence on the primordial originative stuff. However, "oppositeness" as such still remained unclear. Old-fashioned ideas such as necessity, encroachment, recompense, the ordinance of time, showed that reason must go much further if a com- pletely rational explanation were to be reached. Anaximines' device of condensation and rarefaction was, one might say, a step in the right direction but his air sadly brought us back to mythological ideas and breathing, life, divinity were reintroduced into physical speculation. The hope for a straightforward physical explanation suddenly seemed to vanish. However, Guthrie brilliantly shows why this estimate of Anaximines' concept is a mistaken interpretation. He insists that these apparently retrogressive features of the Milesians should not be overstressed. Within the spirit of buoyant rationalism old mythological ideas will in the course of time be depersonalized and transformed into</page><page sequence="3">272 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH the first mechanical laws of nature. Nonetheless, for the time being, the dangers inherent in the Milesian outlook were bound to reverberate in man's estimate of himself and his knowledge; Only because of the pres- sure exerted by the Parmenidean elenchus and the Haraclitean aphorisms, the fifth-century rationalists were convinced that a re-examination of their physicalist theories was necessary. Guthrie maintains that the ideas which prepared the ground for this realization were Pythagorean. In two hundred pages, the book's best, Guthrie methodically sifts the *evidence on the Italian School, examines the character of the religious and moral practices that were associated with it, traces the tendencies present in it, assesses the specific contributions made by its founder and disciples, and concludes with an estimate of the brotherhood. To under- stand the Pythagoreans, Guthrie suggests we must perceive their over-all aim. A piecemeal approach will not do. At the outset we should recog- nize that philosophy for them was a study to right living. The study of man and the study of nature were conceived as techniques for finding how this was possible. They tried to emphasize the kinship between the cosmos and man's soul - admittedly an old religious idea. They held that only then could we realize why the forms of nature and harmony in the soul are but two aspects, if understood rightly, of the same living cosmos. Mathematics, Music, Numbers, the dualism of Limit-Unlimited were successive elaborations of the same religio-ethico-scientific stand; the belief in salvation through philosophy; the ideal of the purified soul feeling justifiedly idetified with the world. Pythagoreanism represents then, according to Guthrie, a vision, a moral commitment, a scientific ideal. As philosophy, Pythagoreanism contributed to thought the idea of abstract forms, it succeeded in gener- alizing mathematics, it provided physics with a device for designating the unobservables. There was no reason for returning to the naive Milesians. Guthrie's incisive comments on these developments, traced against a bewildering tradition of gossip, hearsay and misrepresentation, deserve the closest study. When we eagerly turn to Xenophanes and Heraclitus, the fascinating story already unfolded almost tempts us to predict what would happen when Pythagoreans and Milesians interacted. Xenophanes naturally was bound to attack anthropomorphism in religion by affirming the ultimate unity of the world, an idea, incidentally, which was bound to pose ques- tions about generation (anticipating Parmenides?). Heraclitus under- standably rejected physical appearances underscoring the role of Logos. A radically new era was thus born. Man was now to "search himself"; to look behind appearances; to show readiness to accept the paradoxical; to get a true understanding of the world. Universal Flux, Fire, Logos; the dark sayings that hit the mark must be accepted by the "fiery soul"</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS 273 if it were ever to understand the world. But such accomplishments, Heraclitus seem to have said, were for the few, for the seer, for those who know to seek the Logos in things. At this critical point the book breaks off. Quite soundly Guthrie reserves the Eleatics for his second installment. In the meantime we must retrace our steps, review the panorama laid before us, see its details and grasp its import. Only then can we appre- ciate the need for the new approach, the Way of Truth. With so much accomplished by Guthrie, to offer criticism would be discourtesy, to quarrel about details would be pedantic. I would simply say that this is the best study of early Presocratic thought since Burnet's work seventy years ago. PETER DIAMADOPOULOS. BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
