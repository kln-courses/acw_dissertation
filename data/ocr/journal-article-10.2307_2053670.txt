<plain_text><page sequence="1">VOL. XXXV, No. 4 JOURNAL OF ASIAN STUDIES AUGUST 1976 The Study of Chu Hsi in the West WING-TSIT CHANa C hu Hsib (II30-I200), one of the greatest Chinese thinkers since Confucius and Mencius, and the most important in the last eight hundred years, synthesized Neo- Confucianism and built his own philosophy on a new basis. This philosophy which dominated Chinese thought from the fourteenth century on, Korean thought since the fifteenth century, and Japanese thought since the sixteenth century-began to attract European attention in the seventeenth century. At that time, Catholic missionaries in China quarreled over the translation of "God" as Shang-tiC (Lord-on-High), and over the interpretations of the Chinese term t'iend (Heaven). Consequently, they began to study Neo-Confucian thought. The publication, in I7I5, of the Hsing-li ching-ie (Essen- tials of Neo-Confucianism)' had a strong impact on them; Chu Hsi and other Neo- Confucian thinkers gradually occupied the minds of Catholic missionaries. In I777-85, J. A. Marie de Moyriac de Mailla translated the T'ung-chien kang-muf (Outlines of the Comprehensive Mirror of Good Government) into French.2 However, this book has nothing to do with Chu Hsi's philosophy. He conceived the idea and formulated the principles of the compilation, and laid down the editorial directions; but the work was the product of his pupils-especially Chao Shih-yuang rather than his own material. More than six decades passed before there was any direct study in the West of Chu Hsi. This article surveys ten aspects of that study: (i) Western translations of Chu Hsi's works, (2) Chu Hsi's concept of Shang-ti, (3) Chu Hsi's own philosophy, (4) Chu Hsi's debates with Lu Hsiang-shanh and Ch'en Liang,' (5) Chu Hsi's formula- tion of the tao-ttungJ (Tradition of the Way), (6) Chu Hsi's criticism of Buddhism and Taoism, (7) Chu Hsi's philosophy compared with Western philosophy, (8) the life of Chu Hsi, (9) Chu Hsi's successors, and (Io) the Shushik School in Japan. Western Translations of Chu Hsi's Works Western translations of Chu Hsi's works centered on the Chu Tzu chian-shul (Complete works of Master Chu), published in I714. It is only an anthology of his conversations, letters, and essays; thus, technically, the title is a misnomer. Nevertheless, it has been the most widely used source material for the study of Chu Hsi's thought. In I849, E. C. Bridgeman translated from this book into English certain passages on the Wing-tsit Chan is Anna R. D. Gillespie Profes- sor of Philosophy at Chatham College, Adjunct Professor of Chinese Thought at Columbia Univer- sity, and Professor Emeritus of Chinese Culture and Philosophy at Dartmouth College. This article was published in Japanese as a chapter in the Shushigaku nytmoneu (Introduction to the study of the Chu Hsi School), which is Vol. I of the Shushigaku taikeiev (Great series on the Chu Hsi School) in I5 volumes, Tokyo, I974-75.

Bridgeman had translated the Hsiao-hsiiehm (Elemen- tary education) into English in I836-37.4 However, this work contains none of Chu Hsi's own sayings; rather, it is a compilation by Chu Hsi of selected earlier Confucianists' sayings that reflected his own thoughts. Several decades later, in I874, Thomas McClatchie rendered chapter 49 of the Chu Tzu ch 'uan-shu which is on 0i (principle) and ch'i? (material force) into English,5 with many mistakes. In I876, Georg von der Gabelentz translated Chou Tun-i'sP (IOI7-73) T'ai-chi-ttu shuoq (Explanation of the diagram of the Great Ultimate), including Chu Hsi's commentary.6 In I879 Wilhelm Grube selected for translation certain of Chu Hsi's sayings on 1i and chi,7 and in the following year Chou Tun-i's T'ung-shur (Penetrating the Book of Changes) from the Hsing-li ching-i, together with Chu Hsi's commentary;8 these translations, in German, are fairly accurate. These efforts were followed by those of the French missionary Charles de Harlez. In I887 he translated chapters 3-5, with selections from other chapters, of Kao P'an-lung's8 (I562-I662) Chu Tzu chieh-yaot (Essentials of Master Chu), an anthology of Chu Hsi's conversations and writings.9 In I889 he translated the Hsiao-hsieh, with selections from Ch'en Hsuan'su (I430-87) commentary.'0 In the same year he also translated the Chia- liV (Family rites)." According to Wang Mao-hungw (I668-I74I), this is not Chu Hsi's work but a forgery by someone who compiled the work on the basis of Chu Hsi's postscript to the three Exemplary Family Rites (Pa san chia-lifan),x in which he said'2 that he had wanted to compile a work on family rites based on Ssu-ma Kuang'sy (IOI9-86) Tzu-chih t'ung-chienz (Comprehensive mirror of good government), with selections from other writers but had not been able to do so because of ill health and hoped that someone later would fulfill this task.'3 De Harlez probably was not aware of the unauthenticity of the work. In I890 he translated from the Hsing-li ching-i selected passages by Chou Tun-i, Chang Tsaiaa (I020-77), and Shao Yungab (IOII-77)- including Chu Hsi's comments on Chang Tsai's Cheng-mengac (Correcting youthful ignorance) and also selected sayings of Chu Hsi from the sections on nature and destiny, 1i and ch'i, and the way of government.'4 There are abbreviations in the 3 "Notices of Chinese Cosmogony: Formation of the Universe, Heaven, Earth, Man, Beasts, etc.," Chinese Repository, XIII (I849), pp. 342-47. 4"Seaou Heoex or Primary Lessons," ibid., V (I836), pp. 8I-87, 305-I6; VI (I837), pp. i85-88.

In I89I he translated Chang Tsai's Hsi-mingad (Western inscription), with Chu Hsi's commentary.'5 De Harlez's relentless effort has not been surpassed, though it is quite puzzling that he made no use of the Chu Tzu chi7an-shu published in I714. After Bridgeman's initial limited rendering of it, further translation of that work had to wait for more than fifty years. In I906, Father Leon Wieger published his Textesphilosophiques, confucianisme, taoi'me, bouddhisme, 1 in which he devoted a whole chapter to Chu Hsi. This chapter is made up of sixty-two conversations selected from the Chu Tzu ch 7ian-shu, although the number is small, the selections deal with basic philosophical subjects: 1i and ch'i, yin yangae (negative and positive natural forces), religious sacrifices, man's nature and destiny, good and evil, and the human mind-thus providing a good outline of Chu Hsi's philosophy. More than ten years later, in I922, J. Perry Bruce rendered chapters 42-48 of the Chu Tzu ch 7ian-shu into English, entitling the work The Philosophy of Human Nature, by Chu Hsi."7 As the title indicates, its main subject is human nature; but subdivisions deal with the nature of things, man's destiny, physical nature, capacity, mind, feelings, motive, the will, thought, moral law, virtue, love, righteousness, reverence, wisdom, sincerity, etc. The translation is not entirely free from mistakes. For example, Mencius' well-known saying "Let the mind not forget its objective, but let there be no artificial effort to help it grow"18 is erroneously translated as "On the one hand there is the negation of the ego, on the other the reinforcing of the passions, and both are wrong."19 If Bruce had known that the saying was Mencius', he could have checked the source and avoided the misinterpretation. He also failed to understand the term chin-ssu in Chu Hsi's Chin-ssu luaf (Reflections on things at hand); he thought it meant "modern thought,"20 without realizing that the term comes from the Analects I9: 6 and means that what one thinks about should be matters near at hand. A number of scholars have perpetuated his mistake. However, his rendering of chingag as "seriousness" must be credited as a keen insight.2' Because of their religious background, many scholars have preferred to translate it as "reverence." The word ching used in connection with parents and elders should of course be understood as "to revere"; but to Neo-Confucianists ching is a state of mind, not an attitude toward an object. For the latter, the word should be kungah (to revere, respect). As Ch'eng Iai (I033-II07) has said, "Kung is what is expressed outwardly while ching is what exists within," and "Ching is to concentrate on one thing without deviation." He described ching as "solemn and dignified."22 From this, it is clear that "seriousness" is closer to the ideas of Neo-Confucianists than reverence," which requires an object. We need not go so far as to say that "reverence" is a theistic interpretation, but there is considerable difference between the use of ching in ancient Confucianism as "respect for elders" and in Neo-Confucianism as a state of mind. Bruce translated the chapters from the Chu Tzu ch Yian-shu that concern the nature of man and things.

This matter will be taken up later. In I960, William Theodore de Bary, Burton Watson, and I compiled Sources of Chinese Tradition. The sections on Neo-Confucian thought were assigned to me.24 I selected a number of passages from the Chu Tzu chWian-shu-on li, ch'i, the Great Ultimate, kuei-shenak (negative and positive cosmic forces), man and things, nature and destiny, the mind, and humanity-to provide a small but comprehensive basis for the study of Chu Hsi's philosophy. In A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy (I963), I presented much more material:25 translations of Chu Hsi's four most important short treatises on philosophy-"A Treatise onJenal (humanity, benevolence)," "A Treatise on Ch'eng Ming-tao'sam Discourse on Nature," "First Letter to the Gentlemen of Hunanan on Equilibrium and Harmony," and "A Treatise on the Examination of the Mind- plus 247 selected conversations and passages from the Chu Tzu ch7ian-shu on (i) moral cultivation, (2) the relation between the nature of man and things and their destiny, (3) the nature of man and things, (4) the nature of man and the nature of things compared, (5) physical nature, (6) destiny, (7) the mind, (8) the mind, nature, and feelings, (9) jen, (io) li and ch'i, (ii) the Great Ultimare, (I2) Heaven and Earth, (I3) spiritual beings and spiritual forces (kuei-shen), and (I4) Buddhism. Other than the Chu Tzu ch7/an-shu, the most important translation of Chu Hsi's works is that of the Chin-ssu lu. The first anthology of Chinese philosophy, it is the model for the Hsing-li ta-ch7iana` (Great collection of Neo-Confucianism) and other similar books that followed. As the basis for civil service examinations from I4I5 to I905, the Hsing-li ta-chWian dominated thought for some five centuries. In II75, Chu Hsi and his friend Liu Tsu-ch'ienaP (II37-8I) selected 622 passages from the four leading Northern Sung (960-II26) Neo-Confucianists-Chou Tun-i, Chang Tsai, and the two Ch'eng brothers (Ch'eng Hao,,q I032-85, and Ch'eng I)-and grouped them into fourteen chapters on (i) the substance of the Way, (2) learning, (3) extension of knowledge, (4) moral cultivation, (5) self-discipline, (6) regulation of the family, (7) to serve or not to serve in government, (8) principles of government, (9) political affairs, (io) handling affairs, (ii) education, (I2) correcting oneself, (I3) heterodoxical schools, and (I4) sages and worthies. This book is not only a summary of early Neo-Con- fucianism, but also the standard pattern for later Confucian thought. The work is arranged on the basis of Chu Hsi's own philosophy, and is thus an outline of his philosophical system. More than that, it has been the outline of, and philosophical system dominating, Chinese thought for the last several hundred years. In Japan, thanks to promotion of the book by Yamazaki Ansaiar (I6I8-82) and his six thousand followers, it has also greatly influenced Japanese thought. Not until I953, however, was there a Western translation: Father Olaf Graf's German version, Djin si'lu,as a product of many years of careful work.26 Graf's translation consists of three parts in four volumes. The first part is Intro- duction; the second, in two volumes, translation of the Chin-ssu lu text and its 23 L'Ide'e de Dieu chez Malebranche et l'idee de li chez Tchou Hi (Paris: Librairie Philosophique J.

I248); and the third, numerous informative notes. In the Introduction, Father Graf explains in detail the contents of the Chin-ssu lu and its place in the development of Neo-Confucian thought; he also compares Neo-Confucianism with Buddhism, Taoism, and Western thought-especially that of Spinoza. There is no question that Father Graf's accomplishment marks a great advance in the study of Neo- Confucianism in general, and Chu Hsi in particular, in the West. This despite the fact that Yeh Ts'ai's commentary is really a mediocre work far inferior to those by Chang Po-hsinga (I65I-I725), Mao Hsing-lia (I678-I748), Chiang Yung" (I68I-I762), and Kaibara Ekkenax (I630-I7I4), among others. More than once Yeh Ts'ai misunderstood the text. For example, in chapter 8, section 3, chin-kueiaY (which means "admonitions by favorite courtiers") is misunderstood to mean "adhered to the simple." Chinese scholars have paid little attention to this commentary, and it is not listed in the Ssu-k'u chi7an-shu tsung-mu t'i-yaoaz (Essentials of the complete catalogue of the Four Libraries); however it was very popular inJapan. Father Graf tried to find someone to render his translation into English, but met with no success. Some years later, in the process of Columbia University's publishing great oriental classics in English, it was decided that the Chin-ssu lu should be included-a direct translation from the Chinese plus selections from several Chinese and Japanese commentators. Having just finished a translation of Wang Yang- ming'sba (Wang Shou-jen, bb I472-I529) Ch uan-hsi /ubc (Instructions for Practical Living),27 I was assigned to translate the Chin-ssu lu. To the complete translation of the Chin-ssu lu text,28 I added 28I selections from Chu Hsi's Chu Tzu yi/-leibd (Classified conversations of Master Chu), Chu Tzu wen-chibe (Collection of literary works by Master Chu), Ssu-shu chang-chil chi-chubf (Com- mentaries on the Four Books), and Ssu-shu huo-wenbg (Questions and answers on the Four Books)-as well as Chu Hsi's commentaries on Chou Tun-i's and Chang Tsai's works. There are also 496 selections from ten Chinese commentaries by Chang Po-hsing, Mao Hsing-lai, Chiang Yung, etc.; a Korean commentary by Kim Chang Saengbh (I548-I63I); and six Japanese commentaries by Nakamura Tekisaibi (I629-I702), Kai- bara Ekken, and others. These comments are discussions on ideas; reference data are put in footnotes. There are appendixes on the history and compilation of the Chin-ssu lu and the sources of the 622 selections in it; on seventeen Chinese, six Korean, and eighty-five Japanese commentaries; and on one German translation. Chu Hsi's View on God Early European attention had been drawn to Chu Hsi's philosophy of /i and ch'i- not with the motive of studying his philosophy as such, but to affirm the Catholic belief in God. From the seventeenth century to the early part of the eighteenth, there was a vigorous controversy among the Catholics on the terms Shang-ti and t'ien. Matteo Ricci (I552-I6I0) and other Jesuit fathers, relying only on ancient Confucian Classics and overlooking Chu Hsi's commentaries, insisted that the Confucian Shang-ti and t'ien were identical with the Catholic T'ien-chubJ (Heavenly Lord). Father Nicholas Longobardi, however, held that the Confucian concept of t'ien, as interpreted in the Hsing-li ta- ch7ian of I415, was correct. To him, neither Confucius nor the Neo-Confucianists 27 Instructions for Practical Living and Other Neo-Confucian Writings by Wang Yang-ming (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, I963). 28 Chu Hsi and Lu Tsu ch'ien (II37-8I), comp., Reflections on Things at Hand. The Neo-Confucian Anthology, trans. by Wing-tsit Chan (New York: Columbia Univ. Press, I967).</page><page sequence="6">560 WING-TSIT CHAN believed in an anthropomorphic God. In this, Longobardi was supported by Father Antoine de St. Marie. They contended that the kuei-shen of the Neo-Confucianists were different from Christian angels and that hunbk (the spirit of man's vital force expressed in his intelligence and power of breathing) and ptobl (the spirit of man's physical nature expressed in bodily movements) were not the Christian soul. Having read their books, on 27 March I7I6, Leibniz (I646-I7I6) wrote a long letter to M. Nicholas de Remond, to expound his own ideas.29 According to him, the foundation of Chu Hsi's philosophy is principle and nature; and principle is abstract and without any anthropomorphic character. However, 1i can also be interpreted as an anthropomorphic God, as Ricci had believed; for 1i is a moral principle (and can therefore be equated with God), not (as Longobardi believed) a materialistic reality. Longobardi had argued that the Neo-Confucianists did not believe in Shang-ti, and regarded the emergence of the universe as a matter of chance; their li was nothing but an abstract category. Leibniz, on the contrary, held that 1i is the first principle, therefore the natural law of Heaven. Longobardi's opinion reflected the views of the Catholic missionaries in China at that time. Chinese Catholics were then prohibited by the pope from participating in ancestral rites.30 Exercising his right of sovereignty, the K'ang- hsi" emperor expelled the missionaries. As a result, the impression among European priests was deepened that the Chinese-under the influence of Chu Hsi and other Neo- Confucianists-did not believe in God. The conflict over the question of God can also be seen in Nicholas Malebranche's L'Entretien d'un philosophe chretien et d'un philosophe chinois sur 1'existence et la nature de Dieu, which appeared in I708.31 By "a Chinese philosopher" Malebranche meant a follower of Chu Hsi; he set one up, in this book, to argue for atheism against the Christian philosopher. Malebranche did not really understand Chu Hsi; he relied on poor and faulty sources, and misrepresented Chu Hsi at many points. It was chiefly to correct the European misimpressions about Chu Hsi-so readers could find out in what respects Chu Hsi's 1i and the Catholic God resemble one another and how they differ- that Pang Ching-jen translated chapter 49 of the Chu Tzu ch'ian-shu. In Pang's view, ii possesses a high degree of spirituality; it is not materialistic, as Malebranche saw it. The controversy-never resolved-revived nearly two centuries later with Charles de Harlez's I887 translation of the Chu Tzu chieh-yao, and in I890, the Hsing-li ching-i. Stanisles Le Gall took de Harlez to task for relying on the latter, which is an anthology-and thereby, he thought, a distortion of Chu Hsi's philosophy. In I894, Le Gall published "Tschou Hi,bn sa doctrine, son influence,"32 which includes a translation of chapter 49 of the Chu Tzu chiian-shu; he was clearly attempting to present the authentic philosophy of Chu Hsi. In the following year, de Harlez attacked Le Gall, 29The books he read were: Longobardi, Traite' sur quelques points de la religion des Chinois (I70I) and Antoine de St. Marie, Traite stir quelques points importants de la mission de la Chine (I7I0); both reprinted in Leipzig, I735. His letter is included in Leibniz Opera Omnia, ed. by Ludovia Dutens (Geneva, I710). Henri Bernard, "Chu Hsi's Philoso- phy and Its Interpretation by Leibniz," T'ien Hsiafr Monthly, 5 (I937), pp. 9-I8, presents Leibniz's in- terpretation of Chu Hsi's 1i as equivalent to God, without critical evaluation. 30For an account of the rites controversy and Leibniz's interpretation of the Neo-Confucian li, see David E. Mungello, "Leibniz's Interpretation of Neo-Confucianism," Philosophy East and West [hereafter PE&amp;W], XXI (I97I), pp. 3-I4. 31 With intro. and notes by A. le Moine, Mar- seilles: Imp. et Lithographie A.

In I896, de Harlez wrote Tchu Hi,b" His Doctrines and His Influence,37 a pamphlet of twenty-four pages intended to correct Le Gall's mistake in considering Chu Hsi atheistic. In I898 he wrote "Tschou Hi et les Chinois modernes, ses disciples sont-ils athees?";38 here he again criticized Le Gall for misunderstanding Chu Hsi to be atheistic, and defended his own use of Ming (I368-I644) and Ch'ing (I644-I9I2) anthologies as truly representative of Chu Hsi's thoughts. With this publication, the debate on Chu Hsi's view on God came to a halt. The question of whether Chu Hsi was a materialist was again raised twenty years later when Bruce published "The Theistic Import of the Sung Philosophy."'9 According to Bruce, in Neo-Confucianism there is no distinction between matter and spirit; rather, it is a distinction between physical nature and morality. Li has religious character because it is the source of all things, is moral because it includes benevolence and wisdom. There is an order in the Confucian Tao,bP hence ethics. The Great Ultimate is the sum total of morality; and Heaven is the Lord. Since man's nature is endowed by Heaven, man must be responsible to Heaven in all his actions. When Bruce published Chu Hsi and His Masters in I923,40 he entitled the fourth part "The Theistic Import of Chu Hsi's Philosophy." His main point is that Chu Hsi regarded Heaven as the Divine Immanence and the Supreme Ruler, and thus anthropomorphic; but, Bruce concluded, Chu Hsi was certainly not materialistic. Not long afterward, the Reverend G. G. Warren wrote "Was Chu Hsi a Materialist?"'41 He thanked Bruce for his insistence that Chu Hsi was not a materialist, and for his stressing, the theme that all things come from the same source. Warren further pointed out that Chu Hsi repeatedly talked about Heaven's Mandate, which according to Warren showed that Chu Hsi believed the Supreme Ruler to be an- thropomorphic. From then on, it seems that the West no longer viewed Chu Hsi as a materialist but instead as inclining to belief in a deity. However, in I956, in Science and Civilisation in China. (Vol II) History of Scientific Thought,42 Joseph Needham said that Chu Hsi did not approve of the conception of a personal God, and that this was appreciated much better by Le Gall than by Bruce, who read into it his Protestant theology. It will not be surprising if the controversy arises again. In a related question, Derk Bodde discussed Chu Hsi's view on immortality.43 As T'oung Pao, f n.s. VI (I895), p. III- 34 Ibid., n.s.

What is immortal, then, is pantheistic rather than individual. In this, Chu Hsi followed the atti- tude generally held by the Chinese, especially the Taoists. Bodde thought Chu Hsi did not understand the subtlety of Buddhism. In this, Bodde is correct; but it would be misleading to say that Chu Hsi or other Neo-Confucianists, for that matter did not believe in the immortality of the individual. To them, individual immortality lies in the everlasting character of one's virtue, one's achievements, and one's wisdom. Chu Hsi's Philosophy Stretched over more than two centuries, the lively debate on Chu Hsi's theological position constituted the central point in the study of Chu Hsi in the West. His philosophy came in only incidentally. His conversations on ii, chti, nature, the Great Ultimate, and so on were translated, as already noted. But these were neither treated as central subjects nor systematically investigated. Bruce may be said to be the first to have studied Chu Hsi's philosophy systematically; not that no one wrote on Chu Hsi's thoughts before Bruce, but these writings were incidental, not special studies." In Bruce's Chu Hsi and His Masters, nine out of fourteen chapters are devoted to Chu Hsi; the subjects treated are: Chu Hsi's theory of the universe (law and matter, the first cause and the evolution of the cosmos, the moral order); his doctrines of human nature (the essential nature, the physical nature, the mind, virtue and the virtues); and the theistic import of Chu Hsi's philosophy (Heaven and the mind of the universe). Bruce followed the Chu Tzu ch'u7an- shu closely. One may find defects in details, but the general presentation is quite praiseworthy. Alfred Forke's Geschichte der neueren chinesischen Philosophie followed in I938. The longest section is devoted to Chu Hsi; his doctrines on li, ch'i, God, the Great Ultimate, Heaven and Tibq (the Lord), heaven and earth, yin yang, the mind, spiritual beings and spiritual forces, man's nature, Tao and Virtue are summarized and com- mented on. Also included are Chu Hsi's debates with Lu Hsiang-shan (Lu Chiu-yian,br II39-93) and Western scholars' appraisal of Chu Hsi.45 The area covered is extensive; and the selections from Chu Hsi are generally well-chosen. Forke was superior to Bruce in that he was' a sinologist with a more profound knowledge of the field of Chinese thought. Since both lived with the Western tradition, they naturally laid great emphasis on such questions as God, spiritual beings, and the soul. Fung Yu-lan sb, Chung-kuo che-hs?Veh shihbt (History of Chinese philosophy) was published in Shanghai in I934. Its chapter on Chu Hsi, translated into English in I942, iS divided into seven sections: 1i and the Supreme Ultimate, the ether (ch'i), cosmology, the nature of man and other creatures, ethics and theory of spiritual cultivation, political philosophy, and criticism of Buddhism. In the chapter on Lu Hsiang-shan, there is a section on the comparison between Chu Hsi and Lu.46 In his later works, notably A Short "Le Gall (n. 32 above); H. A.

The emphasis is on Chu Hsi's ethics and method of cultivation; in this, Fung may be said to have revealed the true spirit of Chu Hsi's, interest. In his History of [Chinese] Scientific Thought, Needham's lengthy discussion on Chu Hsi is given under five headings: Chu Hsi and his predecessors, the Supreme Pole (Great Ultimate), the concepts of ch'i and li, evolutionary naturalism in a cyclical setting, and the denial of immortality and deity. The chief discussions are on li and ch'i, although subjects like jen, good and evil, and society are not overlooked.48 Naturally, all subjects are approached from the point of view of science. The special attention given to the problems of immortality and deity is obviously to affirm Chu Hsi's scientific spirit. Needham analyzes the scientific character of Chu Hsi's philosophy with extensive scholarship and profound insight. Just as Fung's great merit lies in breadth, so Need- ham's lies in depth. As to his contention that Neo-Confucianism impeded the devel- opment of science in China, some remarks will be made later. Among contemporary writers in Western languages who have contributed the most to the study of Chu Hsi's philosophy, one is an Easterner and the other a Westerner. The Easterner, Carsun Changbu (I889-I969), devoted three chapters in Volume i of his Development in Neo-Confucian Thought to Chu Hsi:49 one on Chu Hsi's philosophy, including li and ch'i, the Great Ultimate, essential nature and physical nature, mind and nature, personal cultivation, and criticism of Buddhism; one on the debates between Chu Hsi and Lu Hsiang-shan; and one on the controversy between Chu Hsi and Ch'en Liang (II43-94). Being a leading specialist on Neo-Confucianism, Chang covers the subject in an extensive and penetrating manner. The Westerner, Father Graf, broadly examines Neo-Confucianism in his Tao undJen,50 but centers on Chu Hsi. Although his dis- cussions-on the Great Ultimate, li and ch'i, Tao, Heaven, destiny, ch'ienbv (heaven, male) and k'unbw (earth, female), jen, the four virtues (benevolence, righteousness, wisdom, and propriety), equilibrium and harmony, the way of man, investigation of things, mind and the will, the mind of Heaven and Earth, criticism of Buddhism, and other topics-are incomplete, one finds substantial and illuminating material in the book. The scholars mentioned above have contributed much to the Western study of Chu Hsi. Nevertheless, much more is desired, so far as Chu Hsi's philosophy is concerned. Fung's emphasis on personal cultivation reflects Chu Hsi's central concern, but his treatment is relatively brief. Fortunately there is Galen Eugene Sargent's "Les Debats personnels de Tchou Hi en- matiere de methodologie," 51 which deals with Chu Hsi's method of seriousness and righteousness supporting each other, studying things on the lower level in order to understand things on the higher level, investigation of things, rectification of the mind, etc. Sargent's treatment, though brief, is quite to the point. In the philosophy of Neo-Confucianism, particularly that of Chu Hsi, the highest goal of personal cultivation is to achieve jen, the objective of the man of jen being to form a unity with Heaven and Earth. Most writers have included jen in their discussion, but not investigated the subject extensively. In "The Evolution of the Confucian ConceptJen,"52 "A Short History ...

In this treatise, Chu Hsi expresses what the Ch'eng brothers had not expressed: defining jen as "the character of the mind and the principle of love," he saw jen as both substance and function; as both the nature of man and the nature of Heaven and Earth; as embracing the Four Virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, and wisdom to become the mind of Heaven and Earth to produce things.53 Another key idea in Neo-Confucianism is the investigation of things; here Chu Hsi is really the pillar. Though in his Chin-ssu /u there is a whole chapter on the subject, none of the writers mentioned above has dealt with the subject in a special chapter or section. There are only six selections in the section on extension of knowledge in the chapter on Chu Hsi in my Source Book of Chinese Philosophy. Chapter 3 of the Chu Tzu ch' 7an- shu on extension of knowledge, chapters io-ii of the Chu Tzu yii-lei on methods of study, and chapters I5 and i8 of the same on the teaching of extension of knowledge in the Great Learning remain to be translated. There are only two studies on Chu Hsi's epistemology. One is W. E. Hocking's "Chu Hsi's Theory of Knowledge.' "' According to Hocking, Chu Hsi's objective in investigation of things lay in the full understanding of li; thus, he may be considered a rationalist. However, in Chu Hsi's doctrine, full understanding of /i leads to full realization of man's nature; there is unity of nature and li when knowledge and practice go together. This makes Chu Hsi really an empiricist, according to Hocking, who compared him to Spinoza and Bergson. Although Hocking was not a specialist on Chinese philosophy and depended entirely on limited Western sources, his observations are profound and far surpassed the general discussions of previous writers because he himself was an outstanding philosopher. As the first Western philosopher to have taken Chu Hsi seriously, Hocking deserves our respect and gratitude. The other study55 is by David C. Yu.bz In his discussion on Chu Hsi's attitude toward knowledge, Yu explains that in Chu Hsi's investigation of things and full understanding of knowledge, there is no distinction of subject and object, for only when one comes into contact with things can one investigate their principle. Thus intuition and intellection are simultaneous. While personal cultivation is the prerequisite of intellectual pursuit, the objective of knowledge is freedom and spontaneity, whereby one reaches the realm of extensive penetration. As Yu has noted, one can readily see the Buddhist and Taoist elements in Chu Hsi. Both Hocking and Yu show keen insight in their observations. In his chapter on Chu Hsi, Fung Yu-lan added a note which says "When Chu speaks of the investigation of things, he really has in mind only a system of moral self cultivation, and his aim is solely to reach an understanding of the workings of our own minds. . . . It is a mistake, therefore, to regard Chu as here displaying a truly scientific spirit, or to consider him as seeking only for pure knowledge."56 Needham also says that the objective of Chu Hsi's investigation of things is Man, that the realm of nature comes second. Needham's discussions on science his central interest are extensive and illuminating. He finds the world view of the Neo-Con- 5 See also Chan, Source Book in Chinese Philoso- phy, pp. 596-97; and n.

The reason why Neo- Confucianism is scientific, he said, is because its philosophy is fundamentally organic. However he also said that natural science developed in Europe because there is univer- sality in the concept of Natural Law; li being individually organic in character and lacking that sense of universality could not have helped the development of science.57 He stressed Chu Hsi's saying "Every thing and event has its own rule of existence"; but he takes lightly the saying that follows:58 "Taken together, Heaven is li, destiny is nature, and nature is li."59 It is unquestionable that there is universality in ii. However, Needham is on solid ground when he says that Chu Hsi set the highest value on Man, placing him in his proper place within the framework of Nature; that the material is subject to the ethical; that, in investigation of things, observation of Nature is secondary; and that, as a result, the Chinese never got out of their empirical slumber.60 Be that as it may, Hu Shihca (I89I-I962) has noted that when Chu Hsi saw fossils of snails on top of a hill, he remarked that the place was at one time a sea bottom,61 thus anticipating by some three hundred years Leonardo de Vinci's discovery of fossils.62 Whether Chu Hsi's theory of investigation of things is scientific or not, it i's interesting that he did make a scientifc discovery. Other specific subjects that have aroused new interests are the Great Ultimate and t'i-yungc" (substance and function). In a well-documented article,63 David Gedalecia theorizes that Chu Hsi developed the concept of the Great Ultimate in four stages, in terms of 1i and ch i, or substance and function. And I have written on how Chu Hsi took the doctrines of tti-yung and "Principle is one but its manifestations are many" from Ch'eng I, refining and developing them to become patterns of Neo-Confucianism for the following centuries.64 Chu Hsi's Debates with Lu Hsiang-shan and Ch'en Liang From the survey above, that Chu Hsi's doctrine of 1i is rationalistic should be self- evident. His thesis that 1i is identical with nature stands in direct opposition to that of Lu Hsiang-shan, namely that 1i is identical with the mind. Chinese and Japanese scholars have always been keenly interested in a comparison between Chu and Lu; so far, however, Western scholars have shown little interest. There is a short section in Forke's book about their debate at the Goose Lake Temple in II75 Chu advocating inquiry and study, Lu advocating honoring the moral nature-and their ii88 correspondence on conflicting interpretations of the terms and the concept of T'ai-chi.65 Needham is completely silent about these matters; in Bruce's biography of Chu Hsi, over forty pages long, the Goose Lake Temple debate is referred to in only a few lines, without mention of the issue.66 Fung Yu-lan, however, deals with the debate in a special section, making 5 Needham (n. 42 above), pp. 558-59, 565-68, 572-73.

As to the debate over the Great Ultimate, Fung points out that, to Chu Hsi, the Ultimate of Non- being is intended to show that the Great Ultimate is formless, whereas Lu Hsiang-shan thought the Ultimate of Non-being absolutely unnecessary.67 This point is, of course, common knowledge for students of Neo-Confucianism. Dr. Huang Siu-chi"c has also told the stories of the debates, with lengthy documentation on the controversy over the Great Ultimate.68 The most comprehensive treatment of the differences between Chu Hsi and Lu Hsiang-shan is that given in Carsun Chang;69 the subject occupies a whole chapter. In addition to the account of the debates at the Goose Lake Temple and through correspondence, Chang has translated poems Lu and Chu used in the debate, excerpts from Lu's lecture at Chu Hsi's White Deer Grotto Academy, and passages from their correspondence on the Great Ultimate. Chang's discussion is based on Lu's three basic principles: establishing what is fundamental, eliminating desires, and not considering knowledge-seeking as fundamentally important. He seems to have overemphasized the differences between Chu Hsi and Lu Hsiang-shan on such issues as the human mind vs. the moral mind, Heavenly Principle vs. human desires, what is above physical form vs. what is with physical form, and the Great Ultimate vs. the Ultimate of Non-being. A recent article by Julia Chingcd contains fresh material in English on Lu Hsiang-shan's discussions of certain hexagrams at the Goose Lake Temple debate.70 Going beyond the debates, I have given a year-to-year account of the relationship between Chu Hsi and Lu from II72 (when Lu obtained the metropolitan degree) to II92 (when Lu died).71 As to Western discussions on the differences between Chu Hsi and Wang Yang-ming, they are covered elsewhere.72 Chang also spelled out the differences between Chu Hsi and Ch'en Liang. While Chu Hsi emphasized moral principles, distinguished what is above form and what is with form, praised the kingly ruler while denouncing the despot, and held that throughout history human desire has been dominant whereas the Heavenly Principle has remained hidden, Ch'en Liang emphasized utility, made no distinction between what is with form and what is without form, or between the kingly ruler and the despot, or between Heavenly Principle and human desires; he argued that the ancients were not necessarily good and the moderns not necessarily evil.73 Earlier, in connection with the discussion of Chu Hsi's political philosophy, Fung Yu-lan had pointed out that Ch'en Liang had maintained that there is no fundamental qualitative difference between the kingly government of the ancient Three Dynasties (Hsia, 2I83-I752 (?) B.C.; Shang, I75I-III2 (?) B.C.; Western Chou, IIII-770 B.C.) and the inferior governments of the Han (206 B.C.-A.D. 222) and T'ang (6I8-907) Dynasties. The only distinction, Ch'en said, was one of degree, in that the ancient dynasties achieved complete realization of their goals, whereas the later dynasties did not. As Fung has observed, to Chu Hsi the reason that 67 (Note 46 above), pp. 585-93. 68 Lu Hsiang-shan, A Twelfth Century Chinese Idealist, Philosopher (New Haven: American Ori- ental Society, I944), pp. I4-I5, 79-86. 69 (Note 49 above), pp. 285-308. 70 The Goose Lake Monastery Debate (II75)," Journal of Chinese Philosophy, I (I974), pp. I6I-78. 71 "The Relationship between Chu Hsi and Lu Hsiang-shan, a Chronological Account," forthcom- ing in Journal of American Oriental Society. 72 Wing-tsit Chan, "Wang Yang-ming: Western Studies and an Annotated Bibliography," PE&amp;W, XXII (I972), pp. 75-92.

Western scholars had never recognized this achievement of Chu Hsi, not to say the philosophical reasons for his fixing the orthodox transmission. For this reason, I devoted one-third of my essay "Chu Hsi's Completion of Neo-Confucianism" to this question,75 to explain why there was a philosophical necessity for him to fix the line of transmission as he determined it. My discussion involves three points: First, Chu Hsi excluded the Confucianists of the Han and the T'ang from the line of transmission; early Neo-Confucianists like Sun Fucm (992-I057) and Shih Chiehcn (I005-45) had claimed that transmission was from Mencius through Tung Chung-shuCO (I76-I04 B.C.) and Yang HsiungcP (58 B.C.- A.D. I8) of Han and Han yucq (768-824) of T'ang. However Chu Hsi's basis of philosophy is li. Since the Han and T'ang Confucianists had made no contribution to the development of the philosophy of li, they were not central figures in the line of transmission. Secondly, Chu Hsi especially promoted the two Ch'eng brothers; in his line of transmission, he sometimes put Chang Tsai after the Ch'engs and sometimes on the side. Others like Ssu-ma Kuang, Wang An-Shihcr (I02I-86), Fan Chung-yenCS (969-I052), and Shao Yung are cast aside because of their meager-or lack of- contribution to the development of the philosophy of li, their chief interest being in the management of practical affairs. Shao Yung's Taoistic element is too strong, and he had little to say on the investigation of things and full understanding of li; consequently, although he has usually been regarded as one of the Five Early Sung Neo-Confucian Masters, he remained outside the mainstream. Chang often talked about investigation of 1i to the utmost, Principle of Heaven, moral principles, and so on; and he is certainly a pillar in Neo-Confucianism. Nevertheless, the foundation of his philosophy is ch'i. To him, ch'i is the substance, whereas li is either the form or the background; therefore, his contribution to the philosophy of 1i is-at most-one-sided. Thirdly, Chu Hsi singles out Chou Tun-i, for the first time in the history of Chinese thought, as the founder of Neo-Confucianism and a key link in the transmission. Chou had obtained his diagram of the Great Ultimate from a Taoist priest. According to the diagram, cosmology progresses from the Ultimate of Non-being through the Great Ultimate; the two material forces of yin and yang; and the Five Agents (or Elements) of Water, Fire, Wood, Metal, and Earth; and thence myriad things through the interaction of the male and female forces. In spite of this Taoistic origin, Chu Hsi had to accept and depend on the diagram because without it the dualism of /i and ch'i in the philosophy of the Ch'engs, the opposition between what is with form and what is without form, and the conflict between the One and the Many cannot be resolved. Since the two Ch'engs never talked about the Great Ultimate, Chu Hsi had to resort to Chou Tun-i's Explanation of the Diagram of the Great Ultimate. Principle, the One, and what is without form are 7 Fung (n. 46 above), p. 566; see also n. I37 below. 7 In Sung Studies, Memoriam ?tienne Balazs, 2d ser., I (I973), pp. 59-90.</page><page sequence="14">568 WING-TSIT CHAN explained by Chu Hsi in terms of the Great Ultimate; and chti, the Many, and what is with form are explained in terms of the activity and tranquility of yin and yang and the creative and transforming processes of the Five Agents. Only in this way could Chu Hsi resolve the conflicts such as these between 1i and ch'i, and reconstruct Neo-Confucian philosophy into a harmonious system. In short, in the line of transmission as determined by Chu Hsi, between Mencius and the two Ch'eng brothers, Chou Tun-i is put on top, Chang Tsai on the side, and the Confucianists of Northern Sung as well as Han and T'ang outside. All of this was to meet a philosophical necessity.76 The tao-t'ung development around Chu Hsi has lately been retold by Julia Ching.77 Related to the question of the tao-t'ung is the rise and fall of the tao-hsuehct- literally, the Learning of the Way, a specific term for the Neo-Confucianism of the Sung. In recent years, several scholars have shown deep interest in and have written on the subject. In a paper first presented at the I97I conference on Sung studies,78James T. C. LiuCU detailed the background of the tao-hsueh, and the story of how Chu Hsi's teachings were branded as "false learning," and how Neo-Confucianism in the name of Li-hsuehcv (Learning of Principle)-came to be honored and promoted by people in the government. Liu's research was thorough; he gave an excellent account of the thoughts, the life-style, and the political fortune of the tao-hs2eh Neo-Confucianists, especially the political storm Chu Hsi went through. No one has dealt with the question as comprehensively and competently as Liu. In a footnote, he said that the term tao-t'ung had appeared in an official document in II36. He is correct in that the document does deal with the tao-t'ung question; but all evidence still supports the traditional opinion that the term tao-t'ung originated with Li Yuan-k'ang'scw 1172 diagram of the Tradition of the Way, in which the two words tao and t'ung are not coupled as one term. Strictly speaking, Chu Hsi was the first one to use such a term, in his preface to his Chung-yung chang-chicx (Commentary on the Doctrine of the Mean), dated II89. Despite the title of John Winthrop Haeger's article "The Intellectual Context of the Neo-Confucian Syncretism," little is said about the intellectual context of Chu Hsi's syncretism.79 Instead, the article deals with the attack on the tao-hsueh and the rise of the Neo-Confucian orthodoxy. Conrad Schirokauer's presentation at the I97I conference on Sung studies was also on the subject of tao-hsueh80 a thorough examination of the story of False Learning, with solid support of detailed historical facts. The attack on the so- called False Learning, in the several imperial reigns; the arguments used in the attack; its victims; the intricate politics in the tao-hsueh, the activities of the National University students; Chu Hsi's memorial of II94, and reactions to it-all are portrayed on a high scholarly level seldom seen in Chinese or Japanese publications. It is interesting to observe that while the center for Sung studies is in Europe, the study of tao-hsueh is centered in the United States. May we not say that the study of Neo-Confucianism has shifted from Europe to the U.S.? Chu Hsi's Criticism of Buddhism and Taoism Among heterodoxical schools, Buddhism was the most important. Therefore in the Chin-ssu lu, nine out of fourteen sections in the chapter on "sifting the heterodoxical 7Ibid., pp. 73-80. 7" The Confucian Way (Tao and Tao-t'ung)," Journal of the History of Ideas, XXXV (I974), pp. 37I-89. 78" How Did a Neo-Confucian School Become the State Orthodoxy?", PE&amp;W, XXIII (I973), pp. 483-505. 7 In Journal of Asian Studies, XXXI (I972), pp. 499-5I3- 80 "Neo-Confucians under Attack: The Con- demnation of Wei-hsiieh ft in John W. Haeger (ed.), Crisis and Prosperity in Sung China, in press.</page><page sequence="15">CHU HSI IN THE WEST 569 schools" are on Buddhism. In the last several decades, Western scholars on Chu Hsi, with the exception of Forke,8" have paid special attention to Chu Hsi's attack on Buddhism. Bruce has noted that Chu Hsi's doctrine of the mind of man being identical with the mind of Heaven and Earth is similar to the Buddhist theory that the human mind is the Buddha-mind. Bruce has also observed the fact that, in criticizing Buddhism, Chu Hsi emphasized that the Buddhists really did not know what 'mind' is.82 Fung Yu-lan has a special section on Chu Hsi's criticism of Buddhism, stressing Chu Hsi's idea that in Buddhism nature is empty whereas in Confucianism it is concrete, and that in Buddhism the mind is empty-without principle-whereas in Confucianism it embodies all principles although it is also vacuous.83 A similar line of thought is found in Carsun Chang.84 All three writers have limited their discussions to the mind and nature. Galen Eugene Sargent, however, devoted his entire University of Paris Ph.D. thesis to Chu Hsi's criticism of Buddhism from the social, theoretical, practical, and historical points of view.85 He also translated thirty-five selections from the Chu Tzu yi-/ei and the essay on Buddhism from the Chu Tzu wen-chi. Sargent's high standard and fair appraisal of Chu Hsi's criticism are not a surprise in view of the fact that he was a pupil of the authority on Buddhism, Paul Demieville. In my Source Book in Chinese Philosophy, in addition to translations of Chu Hsi's "A Treatise on the Examination of the Mind," I included translations of fourteen selections on Buddhism from chapter 6o of the Chu Tzu ch'uan-shu, and pointed out what an extensive critic of Buddhism Chu Hsi was. Most recently, Charles Wei-hsun Fucy deliberated on the confrontation between Neo-Confucianists and Mahayana Bud- dhism,86 concentrating on Ch'eng I's and Chu Hsi's criticism of the transcendental character of Buddhist thought. The metaphysical approach makes Fu's treatise perhaps the most philosophical on Chu Hsi's criticism of Buddhism. In addition to attacking Buddhism, Chu Hsi also attacked Lao TzuCz and Chuang Tzu;da in the Chu Tzu yu-lei there is a separate chapter on Lao Tzu and Chuang Tzu. As I pointed out in a recent article,87 Chu Hsi attacked Lao Tzu's so-called devious tactics and the empty character of Tao. But he also thought that Lao Tzu made an important contribution to Neo-Confucianism, for he believed the cardinal Neo-Confucian doctrine of production and reproduction (sheng-sheng, db perpetual renewal of life) came from Lao Tzu. That he hated Taoism and yet was willing to give Lao Tzu the credit he deserved testifies to Chu Hsi's greatness. Chu Hsi and Western Philosophers Compared Scholars are fond of comparing Chi Hsi with Western philosophers. E. V. Zenker compared him with Aristotle, Spinoza, and Leibniz.88 Forke followed Zenker; in addition he found Chu Hsi and St. Thomas to be most similar, both having inherited a great tradition and developed it into a unified philosophy.89 To Needham, St. Thomas's synthesizing of medieval European philosophy and Spinoza's naturalistic view of Nature 81 In Forke's book (n. 45 above), there is no section on criticism of Buddhism. 82 Bruce (n. 40 above), pp. 5-24, 246, 254. 83 Fung (n. 46 above), pp. 566-7I. 84 Chang (n. 49 above), pp. 277-78. 85 Tschou Hi contre le bouddhisme (Paris: Impri- merie Nationale, I955). 86 ''Morality or Beyond: The Neo-Confucian Confrontation with Mahayana Buddhism," PE&amp;W, XXIII (I973), pp. 375-96. 8"Chu Hsi's Appraisal of Lao Tzu," PE&amp;W, XXV (I975), pp. I3I-44. 88 Geschichte der chinesischen Philosophie (Rei- chenberg: I926-27), pp. 240, 247, 25I. 89 Forke (n. 45 above), p. 202.</page><page sequence="16">570 WING-TSIT CHAN both find parallels in Chu Hsi.90 These comparisons are quite simple; the comparisons of Father Graf, however, are far more comprehensive. In his introductory volume of the Djin si' lu, he used a whole chapter to compare Chu Hsi's philosophy with Western theism and monism, emphasizing especially St. Thomas and Spinoza. In his great work Tao undJen we find chapters on Neo-Confucianism and ancient Western philosophy; Neo-Confucianism and scholastic philosophy; and Neo-Confucianism and modern Euro- pean philosophy, including English empiricism and German idealism. Let us briefly review scholars' comparisons of Chu Hsi with five Western philosophers. (a) Aristotle. Fung Yu-lan and Carsun Chang compared Chu Hsi only with this Greek philosopher. According to Fung, Chu Hsi's 1i is the same as 'form' in Greek philosophy and ch'i is equivalent to Aristotle's 'matter,' except that Chu Hsi's interest was ethical and not logical, and his tendency was the same as that of Plato.9" For Carsun Chang, Chu Hsi's idea that 1i is attached to ch'i, and ch'i cannot exist independently from li, is similar to Aristotle's theory that the universal cannot exist independently from the particular and is not transcendental but imminent in the particular.92 (b) Spinoza. Decades ago, Bruce pointed out a resemblance between Chu Hsi and Spinoza, regarding the Great Ultimate in Chu Hsi's philosophy, with the two material forces of yin and yang, as similar to God, being both natura naturans and natura naturata, in Spinoza's philosophy.93 Following this line of thought, Father Graf entitled a section of his D/in si'lu "Chu Hsi and Spinoza's Monism."94 He strongly stresses the identity of Chu Hsi's Heaven (t'ien) with Spinoza's God, and also that of Chu Hsi'sjen with Spinoza's intellectual love of God. Father Graf further points out that in both philosophers, philosophical discussions and analysis culminated in the highest good, thus making virtue the goal of knowledge. These observations are repeated and elaborated in many places in his Tao undJen. In addition, Father Graf shows Chu Hsi's amazing similarity to Spinoza in his theories of the creation of the universe; the one source of all things; the Great Ultimate; Tao; the identity of Heaven and God, both of which are the same as 1i; and so on. Even the lives of the two thinkers, Graf has noted, are similar.95 (c) St. Thomas. In I950, Paul E. Callahan made a comparative study of Chu Hsi and St. Thomas.96 Though a preliminary study offering nothing original, depending chiefly on Fung Yu-lan and others, it did kindle a new interest in the subject. In the introductory volume of Father Grafs Djin si'lu, St. Thomas is the subject of almost an entire chapter, with separate discussions on metaphysics, epistemology, and ethics; more elaborate discussions are found in his Tao undJen. His chief emphasis is on the deism of the two philosophers. The fact is stressed that, although there is dualism of 1i and ch'i in Chu Hsi, 1i and ch'i are ultimately united as one. Both t'ai-chi and 1i possess the element of mystery and are creative. Humanity, filial piety, and sincerity have cosmological con- notations. And the search for knowledge lies in knowing Heaven and serving Heaven. All these, Father Graf points out, are harmonious with the philosophy of St. Thomas. However, in his opinion, Neo-Confucianism has not reached the level of Christian 90 Needham (n. 42 above), p. 458. 91 Fung (n. 46 above), pp. 542, 547, 57I. 92 Chang, (n. 49 above), pp. 240-7I. 9 Bruce (n. 40 above), pp. I48, 24I. 9 Graf (n. 26 above), I, pp. 278-97.

Opinions are divided on whether Leibniz was influenced by Neo- Confucianism; both E. R. Hughes98 and Needham believe he was, but others have denied it.99 Bruce sees fundamental differences between Chu Hsi and Leibniz; but as the 'monad', in Leibniz's own words, is at once a body and a soul and is a complex of active and passive forces, he comes close to the thoughts of Chu Hsi.'00 The most discerning comparison, however, has been made by Needham; in a section (almost nine pages) of his work dealing with "Chu Hsi, Leibniz, and the Philosophy of Organism,"'10 two undeniable facts are brought out: (i) Leibniz did study Chinese thought; Needham recounts that Leibniz had read books on Chinese thought when he was barely twenty. About I687 he read on Confucian philosophy, about I700 he read an analysis of the Book of Changes; in a letter written in 1716 he debated with his correspondent on Chu Hsi's view of Shang-ti. According to Needham, until his death Leibniz defended the stand- point of the Jesuits-which is to say that he defended the position of Neo-Con- fucianism.'02 (2) There are similarities between the two thinkers; Leibniz's idea of the monad and pre-established harmony of the universe are strikingly close to the ideas of Chu Hsi that every thing has its own Great Ultimate, and that 1i is an organic order. Although the philosophy of Leibniz has its own European roots, Needham says, the influence of Chinese organic philosophy and naturalism deserves a thorough and careful study. (e) Whitehead. David Yu's Ph.D. thesis, "A Comparative Study of the Metaphys- ics of Chu Hsi and A. N. Whitehead ,'"03 is more on Whitehead than on Chu Hsi. Nevertheless, it deals in a general way with Chu Hsi's doctrine of /i and ch'i, knowledge, mind and nature, and humanity. On the affinities and differences between the two thinkers, discussions are from the viewpoint of experience and knowledge, freedom and human fulfillment. Needham dwells at length on Chu Hsi's 'organism,' saying that Chu Hsi developed a philosophy more akin to the philosophy of organism than to anything else in European thought. According to this philosophy, the world is a single organism, with innumerable smaller organisms contained within it. There exists a universal pattern; the motive power cannot be localized at any particular point in space or time; the organization center is identical with the organism itself-and all this is not directed by an arranger. This entire philosophy, Needham says, is similar to that of Whitehead. Needham therefore suggests that "Chu Hsi's philosophy was fundamentally a philosophy of organism, and that the Sung Neo-Confucianists thus attained, primarily by insight, a position analogous to that of Whitehead.''04 The Life of Chu Hsi As early as I849, Bridgeman translated into English Kao YU'sdc (I656-I737) biography of Chu Hsi.'05 In writing on Chu Hsi, many recent scholars have included an 9 Graf (n. 26 above), I, pp. 239-78; also Tao und Jen (n. 50 above), pp. 3I7-4I. 98 Hughes (trans.), The Great Learning and The Mean-in-Action (New York: E.

Bruce's is fairly extensive, but there are some mistakes in the translation of titles and technical terms. In a recent study entitled "Chu Hsi's Political Career: A Study in Ambivalence,"'106 Conrad M. Schirokauer has made a thorough and profound study of the subject. (The essay is based on his Ph.D. thesis, "The Political Thought and Behavior of Chu Hsi,''107 but is more refined.) Based chiefly on Wang Mao-hung's Chu Tzu nien-p'udd (Chronological biography of Master Chu)-but with frequent consultation of the Chu Tzu wen-chi, the Sung-shih chi-shih pen-wude (Factual details of the History of Sung), and other works Chu Hsi's government services, refusals to serve, dismissal, political achievements, political doctrines, and the like are carefully discussed in almost a hundred pages. This is truly a work of high order. Chu Hsi was an official for only nine years of his life; he served in court no more than forty-six days. Aside from his political career, he taught most of his life. He was one of the most outstanding writers in Chinese history; a renowned poet; leader of intellectual currents that were to run for centuries; a magnet that attracted followers and opponents from all parts of the country; initiator of a number of new tendencies in textual criticism, in interpretation of poetry, and in historiography; an exemplary and innovative govern- ment executive; the one who grouped the Analects, Book of Mencius, the Great Learning, and the Doctrine of the Mean as the "Fo.ur Books," which became and remained for centuries the standard original sources of Confucian thought; the one who determined the line of orthodox transmission of Confucianism; and on and on. Besides Schirokauer's account of Chu Hsi's political career, we also have Professor Li Chi'sdf excellent study of Chu Hsi as a poet.'08 It is hoped that similar studies of other aspects of Chu Hsi's life will soon be forthcoming; a full comprehensive biography of Chu Hsi is overdue. The Followers of Chu HSi One would expect that, along with the study of Chu Hsi, scholars in the West would also study his followers; but to our surprise, there has been very little study of Chu Hsi's pupils and Neo-Confucianists since his time. In his book of I906, Father Wieger selected a few sayings from Chu Hsi's pupils Ch'en Ch'undg (I153-I2I7) and Huang Kandh (II52-I22I), and the Neo-Confucianist Chen Te-hsiudi (II78-I235). These were taken from the Hsing-li ching-i, with neither a proper order nor explanatory notes.'09 Fung Yu- lan quoted critical remarks by Ch'en Ch'un and Ch'en Chiendi (I497-I567) on Lu Hsiang-shan, adding that Lu Lung-ch'idk (I630-93) criticized Wang Yang-ming as Buddhistic on similar grounds."0 In his section on "Rationalism after Chu Hsi," Fung confined himself to Ch'en Hsien-changdl (I428-I500) and Wang Yang-ming, but overlooked Chu Hsi's followers."' In his chapter on Chu Hsi, Forke has a section each on Chu Hsi's pupils Ts'ai Yiuan-tingdm (II35-98) and Huang Kan, and also other Neo- Confucianists Chen Te-hsiu and Ch'en Chihdn (fl. 1208)-the longest section, with ten subsections, being on the last named. This does not compare favorably with his coverage of the followers of Lu Hsiang-shan and Wang Yang-ming. 112 In his chapter on Sung and Philosopher Chu who flourished in the Sung dynasty in the twelfth century, by Kau Yu,fu A.D.

This is not surprising; Chang himself was inclined toward the Neo-Confucian philosophy most advocated by Lu and Wang. Recent writers have shown greater interest in later Neo-Confucianists. Hellmut Wilhelm, in his essay on Neo-Confucianism on the eve of the modern era,"14 has included Lu Lung-ch'i, Chang Lu-hsiangdq (I6iI-74), and Lu Shih_idr (I6iI-72)-with brief discussion on each. My "The Ch'eng-Chu School in Early Ming""'5 examines the philosophy of Tsao Tuands (I376-I434), Hsueh Hsuandt (I392-I464), Wu Yi-pidu (I39I-I469), and Hu Chu jendv (1434-84)-showing that the philosophy of mind in the Ming period did not suddenly appear with Ch'en Hsien-chang and Wang Yang-ming but slowly evolved from the followers of Chu Hsi who thought more and more about human nature and the human mind, gradually ignoring such topics as the Great Ultimate, yin yang, li and ch'i, and the investigation of things, talking instead about the mind and seriousness. My "Hsing-li ching-i and the Ch'eng-Chu School in the Seven- teenth Century"116 deals with the thoughts of Lu Shih-i, Chang Lu-hsiang, Lu Lung- ch'i, and Li Kuang-tidW (I643-I7I8); the adoration of Chu Hsi by Ch'ing Dynasty Neo- Confucianists; and their discussions on the Great Ultimate, yin yang, nature and li, spiritual beings and spiritual forces, strange phenomena, and the line of transmission. In I97I, Hellmut Wilhelm published his "On the Ming Orthodoxy,''117 in which he translated a small part of the "Biographies of Confucianists" in the Ming shihdx (History of the Ming Dynasty). In his comments on the Chu Hsi School, he concentrated on Wu Yu-pi, particularly on his method of moral cultivation as taught in Wu'sJih_ludY (Daily records); in fact, the treatise is virtually on Wu Yui-pi. There is not yet a single essay in a Western language-let alone a book-totally devoted to the followers of Chu Hsi; this is far behind Western studies of the Chu Hsi School in Japan. The Shushi School in Japan George William Knox and Father Graf have been the two main writers who have introduced the Japanese Shushi School (Chu Hsi School) to the West. Knox's "Shushi's Philosophy, &amp;c" in i892118 briefly summed up Chu Hsi's ideas on li, ch'i, and yin yang. Knox also translated Muro Ky5s5'sdZ (I658-I734) Shundai zatsuwaea (Conversations at Surugadaieb),119 which Muro Kyus5 wrote to defend the Shushi School at a time when it was under severe attack-likening himself to Han Yu, whose vigorous defense of Confucianism against Taoism and Buddhism is well known. In the same year, T. Hagaec published two articles'20 outlining the philosophy of the Shushi School, the Oy meied (Wang Yang-ming) School, and the Classical Studies School (Kogakuhaee), and such key concepts in Chu Hsi's thought as nature, li, substance, and function.

Of these, Kaibara has received the most attention in the West. In I9I3, Kent Hoshinoej translated selections from Kaibara's work on the philosophy of pleasure and precepts on popular morals, publishing them under the title The Way of Contentment. 122 In I94I, Graf rendered into German Kaibara's Daigirokuek (Records of great doubts), in two chapters.123 Kaibara praised Chu Hsi very highly. While he never got outside the confines of Ch'eng I and Chu Hsi, he nevertheless harbored many doubts; thus this is an important book in the study of Chu Hsi's philosophy inJapan, and it is gratifying that it is available in a Western language. In the next year, Father Graf published his Kaibara Ekiken in German;121 in it, he discusses in some detail the Japanese Confucianist's life, writings, metaphysics, and teachings on morals, education, and folk values, with a special chapter on three of Kaibara's works, including the Daigiroku. Thanks to Father Graf, Kaibara has become, in the West, the most studied of Chu Hsi's followers in China and Japan. Actually, Father Graf has been the one who has made the greatest effort to introduce Chu Hsi to the West in the last several decades. Before Graf's time, H. C. Armstrong had published his Light from Asia, one of its chapters dealing with the Shushi School-including Seika, Razan, Muro, and Kaibara- as well as the Mitoel School.125 Frederick Starr also devoted a chapter to Japanese Confucianism in his Confucianism, published in I930.126 The section on Chu Hsi is com- paratively longer than those on the Oy5mei School and the Classical Studies School. Both the Armstrong and the Starr books are introductory studies. In the last forty years, Western scholars have paid little attention to the Shushi School in Japan; there has been hardly any publication on the subject to speak of. Sources of the Japanese Tradition, compiled at Columbia University in I958, contains a chapter entitled "Neo-Confucian Orthodoxy"-with a section each on Seika, Razan, Yamazaki Ansai, the Mito School, and Kaibara Ekken.127 Most recently, Okada Takehiko'sem "The Chu Hsi and Wang Yang-ming Schools at the End of the Ming and Tokugawaef Periods"'128 carefully studies the development of the Realization Doctrine, the Returning to Tranquility Doctrine, and the Cultivation Doctrine in the Wang Yang-ming School, and the efforts of Oy5mei scholars at the end of the Tokugawa period to bring about a compromise between Chu Hsi and Lu Hsiang-shan as well as between Chu Hsi and Wang Yang-ming. Okada calls our special attention to the fact that scholars like Ohasi T5aneo (I8I6-62) and Kusumoto Sekisuiep (I832-I9I6) faithfully followed Chu Hsi. The above survey shows that Western interest in Chu Hsi is definitely on the increase. Scholars in the United States are particularly active.
