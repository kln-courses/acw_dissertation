<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LEGAL MARKET IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL MATERIALS FROM ALASKA'S BERING STRAIT Julie HOLLOWELL-ZIMMER* Abstract There is a long history of valuing archaeological materials as economic resources in areas of northwestern Alaska, and an extensive and far-reaching legal market in archaeological bone, ivory and artifacts presently exists. This case looks at the struc ture and history of the trade in Bering Strait archaeological goods and some of the repercussions involving archaeology, art appreciation, Native sovereignty, and free trade. Accusations that people are "cannibalizing their culture" must be weighed against consideration of the complex political, economic and social factors that sup port the market, concerns people have about the loss of this nonrenewable resource, and the existence of multiple valuations of and claims on these materials as objects of cultural heritage.

Today, "subsistence digging"1 of algaaniqsaq or "old things" provides local artisans with materials to use in their contemporary carvings and also supplies raw materials and artifacts that villagers sell to dealers on the open market. Though there are a few diggers in nearly every ivory-rich village along the strait, the major sources of archaeological materials for the market are the former dwelling sites that line the coasts of St. Lawrence Island, a place rich with walrus ivory and whale bone, located directly in the path of Bering Strait marine mammal migrations. The wealth of re sources here undoubtedly contributes to the island's history of at least two thousand years of continuous human occupation. The present village of Gambell, perched at the northwest tip of the island only forty miles from Russia, is where Smithsonian archaeologist Henry Collins, excavating in the late 1920s and 1930s, documented the "type sites" for the unique succession of Okvik, Old Bering Sea, and Punuk ma terial cultures of the western maritime Arctic, found only on St. Lawrence Island, on the Diomede Islands, and along the Chukotkan coast of Russia (Bandi 1969:67-82; Collins 1937; Fitzhugh and Crowell 1988; Rudenko 1961). Savoonga, established as a reindeer camp in the early 1900s and the only other community on St. Lawrence Island today, lies between two major archaeological sites ?Kukulik 10 km to the east and Ivetok 8 km to the west. The tiny Punuk Islands off the southeast coast of St. Lawrence Island have been an abundant source of old ivory and the main findspot of the rare Okvik figurines now coveted so highly on the art market. Decades of min ing, encouraged by traders, field collectors, and archaeologists, have taken their toll here and, to a lesser degree, on all of the old village sites on the island. I began my multi-sited research on St. Lawrence Island and followed the market in archaeological goods from here into the hands of dealers and traders, through the regional hub of Nome, and to such diverse locations as carving workshops in Bali, retail tourist shops throughout the Pacific Northwest, the Internet, and fine art deal ers and collectors in New York and other major cosmopolitan cities. This blatant commercial use of Bering Strait archaeological materials clearly clashes with notions of proper stewardship and ethical practice promulgated by professional archaeolo gists who are concerned about the relationship between commercialization of ar chaeological artifacts and the destruction of archaeological sites worldwide.2 When 1 A "subsistence digger" is defined by David Staley in an article about artifact diggers on St. Lawrence Island (1993:348) and by Dave Matsuda in his study of subsistence digging in Belize (1998:96) as a person who uses the proceeds from artifact sales to support a subsistence lifestyle. The term is used by St. Lawrence Islanders to describe (and defend) artifact digging today; in fact, I was once reprimanded by a village council for writing about a woman who hoped to pay for her college education by selling an artifact she had found because this was not considered a "subsistence" use of the proceeds. 2 For more information on the relationship between archaeological site destruction and the commercial market, see Brodie, Doole and Renfrew 2001; Cameron 1997; Messenger 1999[1989]; O'Keefe 1997;</page><page sequence="5">The Legal Market in Archaeological Materials from Alaska.. 11 villagers dig for artifacts and remove them without documentation from their context in the ground, most of the information encoded in sites and artifacts is destroyed. Many archaeologists feel an irretrievable loss of knowledge about a very important area of the world and understandably are upset about what is happening on St. Lawrence Island. At the same time, in recent decades archaeologists have had to acknowledge that theirs are not the only claims to the archaeological record, and in some cases, their concerns and claims are strongly contested by people with very different ideas about the value and ownership of archaeological sites and artifacts. It is my hope that sci entific archaeology and conservation will become viable options for managing the archaeological record in the Bering Strait. For this to occur, however, archaeologists will need to make a case for how archaeological practice and preservation can ben efit a community economically, socially, and intellectually and find common ground for collaboration with people who have very different priorities and concepts of stew ardship. After a discussion of the legal basis for the Bering Strait trade in archaeological materials, I describe the extent of the market and its economic appeal. I then take a brief look at the history of the market, including the role of government agencies and archaeologists in promoting the economic value of artifacts. Finally, I describe some of the local attitudes toward digging on St. Lawrence Island and conclude with ex amples of how archaeology might proceed from here. A legal market? The St. Lawrence Island artifact trade is in all likelihood the most extensive and lu crative legal market in archaeological artifacts in the world today. Why is it legal? The answer has to do with property rights and land claims. In most countries, any archaeo logical materials that people find, even on private property, are legally the property of the nation-state and cannot be bought or sold by private citizens. In some places, a person who finds an artifact on his own property and registers it with local archaeo logical authorities might be allowed to possess the object, care for it, even use it, but that person does not have rights of ownership or rights of transfer, so the artifact is not legally his to sell. The United States (U.S.) has a different attitude and legal standard regarding pri vate property rights than many other nations. Any archaeological materials (except Schmidt and Mclntosh 1995; Tubb 1995. The professional code of ethics of the Society for American Archaeology condemns all activities that stimulate the commercialization of archaeological materials (Lynott and Wylie 1995; Society for American Archaeology 1996), a position that obviously places archaeologists at odds with art dealers, collectors, and Inuit subsistence diggers.</page><page sequence="6">12 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 21 human remains) found on private land are considered the property of the landowner. U.S. laws that protect archaeological sites, including the Antiquities Act of 1906, the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979, and the many state-level versions of these laws, apply only to sites and materials found on public (state and federal) lands. It is legal to dig for artifacts on private land or sell them to others as long it is done with the landowner's permission. This means that the United States is one of the few places in the world where people can legally dig for antiquities and place them on the market. In 1971, the U. S. Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA), catalyzed by the advent of oil exploration on the North Slope (see Arnold 1978). The act extinguished all present or future claims of aboriginal title (the right to claim ownership over land and resources based on their inherent status as first peoples) by Alaska Natives and replaced it with corporate status. Anyone with 25% or more Alaska Native blood was "entitled" to enroll as a stockholder in one of 13 regional corporations and in one of 203 village corporations, depending on where he lived. The Native corporations received 40 million acres of land ?about 11% of the state of Alaska? and $962,500,000US which they now had to invest and man age like any other corporate entity.3 Today, most of the land held by Native corporations in Alaska is private property, managed by the corporation for the benefit of its stockholders. While several Native corporations have policies that prohibit or discourage "subsistence digging" in ar chaeological sites on their lands, others allow shareholders to dig in some areas and not others (Norbert 1983).4 However, few areas have anything near the quantity or quality of marketable archaeological resources that can be found on St. Lawrence Island. In their land claims negotiations, the two Native Village corporations of St. Lawrence Island refused a larger monetary settlement and chose instead to acquire title to their entire island (1,135,949.79 acres) under a special provision of the 1971 act. Though this made Gambell and Savoonga statistically among the poorest of Alaska Native villages and left them with no capital to invest in corporate enterprises, they received about three and a half times more land than if they had taken the monetary settlement (Jorgensen 1990:29-30). While some outsiders have inferred 3 Until ANCSA was amended in 1989, the agreement stated that after 1991 no more stock would be available for newly born Alaska Natives and stockholders could begin to sell their stock in Native corporations on the open market (to non-Natives). These measures could easily be interpreted as forms of institutionalized cultural genocide. It took a constitutional amendment to give Native corporations the power to decide under what conditions shareholders could alienate their stock. 4 The Wales Native Corporation, for example, has a policy that shareholders can dig in the Hillside site just south of the village but not on the Kurigitavik Mound site to the east.</page><page sequence="7">The Legal Market in Archaeological Materials from Alaska.. 13 that the burgeoning artifact market of the early 1970s was a factor in the choice to secure these legal property rights, most St. Lawrence Islanders emphasize that they had a broader, longer term outlook about the value of their land and its resources than any monetary compensation could offset. No one on the island seems to regret this decision: "We didn't take the land claims money, and I'm glad for that. We have our land here; that money would go away but the land here won't" (anonymous in terview 6/26/95 Gambell). Today the island is owned privately and jointly by the two Native Corporations for their approximately 850 indigenous stockholders. Digging for artifacts is restricted to stockholders, and the main unwritten rule is one of "finders keepers", though other informal use rules (not covered here) guide how people stake a claim to sites and distribute their finds. Some people say that the right to dig for artifacts essentially replaces the dividends that the two Native corporations, due to their land claims choices, cannot afford to distribute.5 Somewhere around a million dollars worth of archaeological bone, ivory and artifacts is sold from St. Lawrence Island each year (Figure 2).6 Description of the market Raw Materials. The market in Bering Strait archaeological materials turned out to be much more extensive and complex than imagined. First, there is a large market in raw materials, mainly old walrus ivory and aged walrus and whale bone used for carving. Mineralized or "old" walrus ivory (often mistakenly called "fossil" ivory) can take on hues of creamy brown, blue-black, or peach after years of being buried in the ground. Most old ivory is excavated by diggers, but some is found washed up after eroding from sites along the coast. Old house structures and butchering sites are plentiful sources of walrus and whale bone. Small amounts of these raw materials are sold or bartered by diggers to local craftspeople. Village ivory carvers and doll makers work in old ivory when they run out of new white ivory or want some color contrast in the carvings and crafts they make for the market. Whalebone carvers always prefer older, well-seasoned bone since newer whale bone reeks of oil and is more difficult to carve. 5 Contrast this with the Arctic Slope Regional Corporation which distributes regular dividends from oil and gas revenues. The local government of the region oversees and publishes the results of archaeological research and has its own archaeological protection campaign (See North Slope Borough Commission on Inupiat History, Language and Culture n.d.). 6 This rough estimate of the total wholesale value of on-island transactions is based on interviews with dealers and my collaboration with two business consultants who were hired by the Village Council of Gambell to conduct studies of the market for St. Lawrence Island materials.</page><page sequence="8">14 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 21 Figure 2. Booth at Saturday Market in Anchorage. These dealers travel to Savoonga on St. Lawrence Island several times a year to purchase bone, ivory, and artifacts. The majority of archaeological ivory and bone goes in a "raw" or unworked form to a regional and global wholesale market. Villagers gather these materials from old sites and stockpile them to sell by the pound to wholesale dealers who periodically fly to the island to make bulk purchases. The dealers then sell to carvers, Native and non-Native, who transform old bone and ivory into goods for the tourist market that range from trinkets and souvenirs to jewelry and sculpture. The policies of the U.S. Marine Mammal Protection Act (MMPA) indirectly and un intentionally encourage the sale of archaeological ivory and bone. The act contains an exemption that permits Alaska Natives to continue their subsistence hunting of marine mammals for noncommercial purposes. It also allows them to sell the byproducts of these harvests (walrus ivory, whale baleen, seal skin, etc.) to non Natives, but only after being made into arts and crafts. With the passage of the act in 1972, what was once a profitable market in new white ivory in these same Bering Strait villages suddenly became illegal, but any older marine mammal materials, as long as they were harvested before 1972, could still be sold without restrictions and used by non-Native artisans as a raw material. Demand on the open market for these exotic carving materials has been steadily increasing. Today a dealer can buy old ivory on St. Lawrence Island for anywhere from $40 to $90 a pound, depending on its color and quality, and sell it for from $80 up to $250</page><page sequence="9">The Legal Market in Archaeological Materials from Alaska.. 15 a pound (one tusk weighs around 3 to 4 pounds). Walrus and whalebone sell to non Native carvers for $5 to $14 a pound after being purchased in the villages for about $1.25 a pound. "Specialty" bones are sold individually at higher prices; an extreme example is the walrus oosiks (penis bones), which sells on the retail tourist market for up to $200. One non-native carver of old ivory sell oosiks carved with goddess motifs for over $3000 a piece in her Juneau gallery. Many non-Native artisans create their own unique designs and art forms from these archaeological materials, while others use them to imitate Inuit-style designs, capitalizing on the immense Alaskan tourist appetite for "Native-style" art.7 Just in the last decade a growing number of non-Native artists in Alaska have started carv ing whalebone sculptures for the tourist market, piggybacking on the success of Inuit whalebone carvings in Canada and Alaska (and as an alternative to the high cost and small size of walrus ivory). A number of carving workshops, some supplied by the same dealers who travel to St. Lawrence Island, crank out bone and old ivory figurines with "Eskimo" themes. It particularly distresses Inuit villagers that they are supplying others with the raw materials used to make Inuit-style imitations that are often marketed with appeals to Inuit culture. There are currently no restrictions on the export of legally procured archaeological materials from the United States, but some countries regulate or restrict the import of marine mammal materials (regardless of age) under the 1973 Convention on Inter national Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Since 1990, the U.S. Fish and Wild life Service has tracked all the old walrus ivory leaving and entering the U.S., 90% of which goes to Indonesia, where CITES permits are not required. Dealers export bulk quantities of archaeological bone and ivory from Alaska to Indonesian carving work shops where skilled artisans paid about $5 a day carve "Native-style" work for even tual sale in Alaskan tourist shops (Melzer 1995). One Seattle-based artist purchases high quality tusks of old ivory on St. Lawrence Island, takes them with to carvers in Bali who work from his designs, and sells the completed sculptures in a fancy gallery in Skagway, where the biggest cruise ships stop. I ran into an interesting twist on the export of archaeological ivory in a gift shop in Anchorage. The dealer who owns the shop had taken old ivory purchased from St. Lawrence Island to Bali and had it carved in the style of an Old Bering Sea harpoon head. The result was a replica made in the very style and materials as a 2000 year old original (Figure 3). 7 Tourism is the fastest growing industry in Alaska; in 1999,1.2 million "visitors" spent close to a billion dollars in the state (McDowell Group 2000). Though about half of the retail purchases made by tourists in Alaska each year are "said to be" Native arts and crafts, the Alaska Department of Commerce and Economic Development estimates that 75-80% of these items are not actually made by Alaska Natives at all (MacPherson 1994). Shops are full of mass-produced imports and non-Native-produced work imitating Native styles with labels bordering on consumer fraud.</page><page sequence="10">16 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 21 Figure 3. This Old Bering Sea style harpoon head is actually a replica, made from old ivory found on St. Lawrence Island, exported and carved in Bali, then imported back to Alaska to be sold in an Anchorage gift shop. Artifacts. In addition to the raw materials that are recycled from archaeological sites to produce contemporary Inuit and non-lnuit art, there is a widespread market in another form of Inuit art ?archaeological artifacts. Diggers from St. Lawrence Island and other ivory-rich villages sell the artifacts they find at prices from $40 per pound for bulk scraps and fragments up to asking prices of $175,000 for one exceptional piece. The artifact market ranges from souvenir-like fragments pasted on index cards that sell in gift shops for $5 to $10 (Figure 4), to display cases stocked with individual artifacts, to framed collections of old tools marketed as "St. Lawrence Island Artifact Boards" for several thousand dollars. Less valuable artifacts are sometimes treated like raw materials, sawed in pieces and made into beads or belt buckles, refashioned into knife handles and necklaces, or used as a base for scrimshaw work. The presence of cases of "St. Lawrence Island artifacts" and objects fashioned from archaeological ivory and bone in gift shops all over Alaska gives tourists the idea that buying and selling archaeological materials is not just acceptable, it's part of the Alaskan tourist experience. Advertised romantically as "expressions from long lost millennia found in the frozen earth of ancient villages ..." or "in touch with the spirit of the bone", the age, patina, and the overt association with remote, "authen tic" Eskimo culture create the sense that one is purchasing part of an exotic and pre</page><page sequence="11">The Legal Market in Archaeological Materials from Alaska.. 17 historic past. Another marketing ploy for archaeological ivory plays directly on the sympathies of animal rights supporters; tags and labels often describe old ivory as "the moral choice since no animals were killed to make this piece". This is little more than a tactic (used almost exclusively by non-Natives) to divert consumers away from goods Inuit artisans are allowed to make from materials procured in their subsistence harvests. At any one time dozens of "St. Lawrence Island" artifacts are for sale on the Internet for anywhere from $5 to $500, advertised as "legally excavated by Eskimos". Most of these are crude tools and implements either from old collections found in attics or purchased on recent trips Alaska, but some are 'line" enough to attract amateur relic collectors from coast to coast. According to "Big Al", a trader based in Wisconsin who sells Eskimo artifacts on eBay that he purchases during his summers in Nome, pieces priced over $2500 will not sell on-line. As of this writing, no St. Lawrence Islanders have yet created their own websites to sell artifacts, but it is only a matter of time. At the high end of the market are artifacts recognized in the art world as antiqui ties or "primitive" art. These include decorative Old Bering Sea, Okvik and Punuk ob jects, particularly animal forms, anthropomorphic figurines, and winged objects, which fetch high prices in galleries, at auction houses and from art collectors the world over. Though this segment of the antiquities market receives the most attention (even from Figure 4. One ivory and bone dealer purchases artifact fragments in bulk from St. Lawrence Island diggers, glues them onto 3x5 cards, and sells them to tourists for $5 to $10 in his Anchorage retail outlet.</page><page sequence="12">18 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 21 archaeologists), the artifacts in glossy catalogs and behind glass with high monetary values represent the virtual tip of the iceberg, usually no more than a dozen pieces out of literally tons of other marketable materials pulled out of archaeological sites in a year's time. Finding a piece worthy of the art market is like hitting the jackpot, a rare by-product of more general multipurpose mining efforts (Figure 5). Local dig gers in the villages (men and women alike) negotiate prices for these artifacts with "primitive art" dealers from New York and Seattle who fly in at the end of the sum mer digging season. Sometimes diggers ask prices well beyond what an artifact could sell for either privately (to a collector or another dealer) or publicly (at a gallery or auction). In some cases, negotiations over a piece go on for years. The highest price paid at public auction for a Bering Strait ivory is $122,000 for an Okvik figurine from St. Lawrence Island at Christie's in 1995 (Christie's 1995), but collectors will pay even higher prices in private transactions with reputable art deal ers. In the art world, where fashion, pedigree and uniqueness create value, nothing Figure 5. Okvik figurine, private collection; provenance unknown (from Wardwell 1986:52).</page><page sequence="13">The Legal Market in Archaeological Materials from Alaska.. 19 is more thrilling to most collectors than to be offered a newly "surfaced" or exca vated object that has not been "seen" by the public or "walked around" at auction. Collectors typically feel a strong sense of stewardship toward these objects from the past. The small cadre of dealers who specialize in these high-end materials create demand and value by advertising in special interest magazines, placing artifacts in exhibitions and galleries, and extolling the unique, "primitive", or "shamanic", qualities of their products (Figure 6). Fakes and Smuggling. Antiquities markets, since Roman times, are infamous for spawning fakes (Meyer 1973:108; Alsop 1982:156-9). With easy access to old ivory to carve, someone will occasionally try to pass off new carvings as old to unwitting buyers, using techniques like burying, burning, or boiling in coffee to attain the de sired look. These practices are discouraged by villagers and dealers. For example, a couple of years ago during a visit to Savoonga, I saw a sign posted at the village store warning that someone in the village was burning ivory to make it look old. Smuggling is also a small part of the trade since Deposits of old ivory and Old Bering Sea artifacts are found in archaeological sites on the Russian side of the strait along the coast of Chukotka. Though it is illegal to export ivory or artifacts from Rus sia without government permission, the extremely desperate economic conditions of Inuit villagers there make smuggling a tempting proposition.

U.S. dollars have little value in the Russian villages, where boats, motors, rifles and ammunition are preferred in exchange. The historical context of the market St. Lawrence Island was most likely populated to take advantage of the tremendous migrations of marine species tunneling through the strait. We know from oral histo ries and the archaeological record that hunting and gathering and recycling and re use of any available resources ?from the wood, bone and hides used in house construction to the re-working of broken tools? were always, and continue to be, important facets of daily life and survival in the Arctic. In addition, the Bering Strait was a superhighway for intercontinental trade of exotic materials long before written records (Ray 1975; Fitzhugh and Crowell 1988; Fitzhugh and Chaussonnet 1994). Old walrus ivory was coveted as a luxury good in India and the Middle East centu ries ago (Cammann 1954:16-20) and probably traveled from eastern Russia on the Silk Road. Digging for materials for the global market today is in many ways an ex tension of these longstanding recycling and trading activities (Norbert 1983). A good place to search for evidence of transactions involving digging up or sell ing archaeological materials is in the first-hand accounts of early explorers and whalers in the Bering Strait. From the outset, these foreigners traded with local people for basic needs of Native food and clothing and sometimes bartered for curios as souvenirs of their travels. They were soon followed by traders in search of Native-harvested ivory, baleen, and sea mammal oil to sell to markets in San Francisco and Seattle (Bockstoce 1986). It seems that old unworked walrus ivory was always more highly valued as a raw material than white ivory; stories exist of Natives burying or urinating on white ivory to make it look old to sell to whalers at higher prices (Kilian 1983:40; Madsen 1957:136-9). Cutlery handles from old ivory were manufactured in San Francisco beginning around the 1870s.8 The early trade in Inuit curios was for the most part limited to ethnographic, not archaeological objects (Nelson 1983 [1899]) and to work produced in white ivory spe cifically for the souvenir market such as cribbage boards, engraved pipes, ivory carv ings and jewelry (Ray 1977). This trend continued through the early part of the Nome Gold Rush period, but as early as 1889, the accounts of whalers, traders, and ad venturous tourists describe how they spent time digging in burials for skulls and ar 8 E.

The first archaeological materials from the Bering Strait that were sold to museums and pri vate collectors (like George Heye) tended to be burial goods taken surreptitiously from graves by non-Native intruders, but as soon as someone was willing to pay or trade for skulls or artifacts, local people could be found who were willing to gather them (McDaniel 1956). Perhaps the biggest boost to the artifact market were the arctic archaeologists of the early twentieth century whose work was sponsored by museums intent on filling their shelves. In Barrow in 1913, just after the crash of the global market in baleen (when the invention of spring steel replaced the use of baleen in corsets, buggy whips and umbrellas), Vilhjamur Stefansson paid diggers roughly a dime per artifact to bring him specimens in return for credit at the local trading post. In this way, he gathered over 20,000 artifacts for the American Museum of Natural History in a matter of weeks (Brower 1994:243-4).9 In 1926, Diamond Jenness purchased several Old Bering Sea artifacts during fieldwork on Little Diomede Island (Morrison 1991), and Ales Hrdlicka bought several specimens during a stop on St. Lawrence Island aboard a Coast Guard cutter, only to find that the sailors had beaten him to some of the best pieces (Hrdlicka 1930:91). The unique and decorative styles of the artifacts Hrdlicka brought back to the Smithsonian aroused a great deal of curiosity and quickly led to several institutionally-sponsored excavations. Memories of these early interactions and how local people were treated by archae ologists are still vivid among St. Lawrence Islanders. Archaeological ethics, exca vation techniques, and documentation were very different then than they are today. It was common practice at the time for archaeologists to buy archaeological "speci mens" from the villagers. Adventurer-turned-archaeologist Otto Geist, who excavated on the island over a ten-year period beginning in 1927, posted a notice at the store when he arrived to announce that he was buying artifacts10 (something dealers still do when they arrive in the village today). Local residents were at first very reluctant to dig for Geist, especially when he began to excavate at the Kukulik site where famine had decimated the most recent settlement there only fifty years before. Geist enticed workers by allowing them to keep any raw old ivory they found for their own use. Even so, he brought enough old ivory back to the University that the college sold chunks of it to carvers across the country for a short time in the 1940s.11 9 V.

In the Bering Strait region ANAC encouraged the use of old ivory as a raw material due to its color and availability, but the villagers already had a well-developed mar ket for as much of the old ivory as they could gather (to markets as diverse as scrimshanders in Hawaii). In 1939, when Froelich Rainey arrived to excavate the Okvik site on the Punuk Islands, just offshore of St. Lawrence, he was amazed at the extensive commercial mining for old ivory already in progress there. He hired ivory diggers as his excavators, utilizing their first-hand knowledge of house ruins (Rainey 1941:463-8). For several years beginning in 1941, ANAC also sold archaeological artifacts through their catalog, most of them gathered from eroding seaside middens by local residents of Point Hope12 People in Gambell associate the rise of the artifact market with the installation of military bases on the island during World War II. The many military personnel stationed across Alaska were willing to pay higher prices for local crafts and artifacts, and many of them enjoyed digging in their spare time (The Aleu tian 1943: 9, 26). Until the early 1970s, teachers, construction workers, and government officials were the main patrons of local diggers, and prices changed very little. There are sto ries on St. Lawrence Island from this period of large Okvik "dolls" being sawed up sold as ashtrays to Japanese fishermen (J. Myers, personal communication 9/99). But things changed in the early 1970s, soon after the island became private land. By this time, art and ethnology museums were seeking representative examples of Old Bering Sea and Okvik materials from St. Lawrence Island since scholarship had secured them a place in the sweep of art history (see Meldgaard 1960:19). In 1972, a few diggers from Savoonga approached museums about buying some newly excavated specimens. Several of these pieces subsequently appeared in a 1973 exhibit at the National Gallery of Art called The Far North (Collins et al. 1973). It was this event that brought Bering Strait ivories, especially the Okvik figurines, to the attention of the art world where they soon were admired as representatives of the primitivism that inspired modern masters like Brancusi, Modigliani, and Henry Moore. The following summer, the first runners for the art market made their way to St. Lawrence Island. This created a significant shift in the price structure of Bering Strait artifacts. A digger who had sold a figurine for $10 in the 1940s might approach 12 ANAC 1941: Price List, Ethel Montgomery Papers (MS 136), Box 2, Historical Collections, Alaska State Library, Juneau.</page><page sequence="17">The Legal Market in Archaeological Materials from Alaska.. 23 a museum asking $250 for the same object in 1972. By the end of that decade, the same digger might ask $5000 for the object (and today, probably $100,000), now from dealers who were coming to them to buy for wealthy collectors. For a brief period in the early 1980s, the Native corporation in Gambell ran a business that purchased bulk ivory and artifacts from shareholders to sell on the market (Crowell 1985:21-24), but the venture folded soon after many of the artifacts taken to a Sotheby's auction went unsold. This rise in the economic and artistic valuing of Bering Strait artifacts parallels a rising concern among archaeologists about the connections between the commer cialization of archaeological antiquities and site destruction, not just in North America but all over the world. Except for monitoring of water and sewer projects, there has been no systematic archaeological excavation on the island since Bandi's work in 1974 at several sites near Gambell (Bandi 1984) and George Smith's excavation at Kialegak (Smith et al. 1978). In 1984, Aron Crowell conducted a survey of sites and site destruction on St. Lawrence Island, a joint project of the Smithsonian and the Sivuqaq Native Corporation, with the idea of specifying sites with enough remaining archaeological significance and integrity as off limits to commercial digging (Crowell 1985). No actions were taken, and his report is jokingly referred to on the island as a "digger's guide". In 1986, the opening of the American Federation of Art exhibit "Ancient Eskimo Ivories of the Bering Strait", this time of predominantly privately owned and unprovenienced objects (Wardwell 1986) generated protests from the archaeological community. In 1987, the Anchorage Museum of History and Art stopped purchasing artifacts from diggers who walked in off the street, and today even the donation of an old ivory piece requires special consideration by the board (W. Van Horn, personal communication 1995, 1997). Local perspectives On St. Lawrence Island today, subsistence digging is an integral part of the local economy and social fabric as well as part of the heritage of the islanders. Sales of old ivory, bone, and artifacts often help individuals and households meet basic needs like paying bills, buying boats, guns, four wheelers, ammunition, gas, and clothing in communities where unemployment and basic living expenses are extremely high, where subsistence harvests are still integral to survival, and few other local resources can be readily converted to cash. In a village where the massive dependency on government subsidies and grants for goods and services is viewed as a despised but necessary evil and agencies regulate hunting and fishing, the market in archaeo logical materials is one arena neither controlled by nor dependent on anything other than individual enterprise and market demand.</page><page sequence="18">24 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 21 Finding and selling a valuable artifact confers status and prestige, and young people are anxious to make their first important sale. Older diggers are regarded as knowledgeable professionals and community historians. Families consider digging a recreational or seasonal subsistence activity, much like berry-picking. Third grade primers depict children going out to dig; obituaries remark "She loved to dig for arti facts" (Nome Nugget 1 October 1998:19). People perceive archaeological resources almost like a form of inheritance from their forbearers, and sites like a bank. It is common to hear people say Our ancestors left us these things so we could survive in a cash economy." During years when more jobs are available in the community (as with the recent construction of water and sewer lines), dealers notice fewer people digging and fewer artifacts coming onto the market. Local concern over the loss of this nonrenewable cultural property is far from absent, and residents hold a range of personal, sometimes conflicting, opinions about digging and selling artifacts. There is a sense of remorse that these objects end up far away in unknown places and hands. When I was in Savoonga in 1998, the presi dent of the Native Corporation proudly showed me a series of digital images on his computer of a finely etched Old Bering Sea whaling harpoon socket, taken so people could remember the piece after it was gone. The next time I saw the piece was on a shelf in a dealer's office in Manhattan. One day in Gambell an elder waved her arm at the digging sites out the window and said, "All the troubles in our village started when they began to dig those holes out there." In 1989, the National Park Service rescinded the National Historic Landmark sta tus of the five old village sites in Gambell due to the damage from subsistence dig ging (Morton 1989). No one seemed to care, especially since Historic Landmark status was interfering with where to locate the new school. However, a lot of press about local digging practices ensued, and St. Lawrence Island became known as a case where people were "cannibalizing their heritage" (Enders 1990; Eppenbach 1991a, 1991b; Perala 1989). But perhaps a Euro-American notion in which objects of material culture are venerated as "heritage" is somewhat foreign to people whose heritage is performed and experienced in daily practices like speaking their own lan guage, whaling, eating indigenous foods, and drum-dancing without the presence of tourists. Most villagers would agree that the elders are the real cultural treasures, not an object behind glass in a museum. This may be changing somewhat in the wake of the Native American Grave Pro tection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and the symbolic power that repatriation accords to objects of material culture.13 Several museums have repatriated human 13 NAGPRA allows Native groups recognized by the U. S. government to request the return of human remains, burial goods, and sacred or communally owned objects from federally funded museum collections.</page><page sequence="19">The Legal Market in Archaeological Materials from Alaska.. 25 remains and artifacts to St. Lawrence Island. The human remains have been rebur ied on the island; many people would like to see a safe place in the community to bring home the artifacts, but until one exists, they remain stored in a museum in Fairbanks. The two council members in Savoonga whom I was told were most inter ested in planning a future culture center and museum were "out digging" when I called. Subsistence and sovereignty Politically, St. Lawrence Islanders are known for their independence and au tonomy, even within the broad spectrum of the Alaska Native and circumpolar com munity. They have so far rejected all offers from outside entities to lease, mine, or develop their natural resources, an indication of strong intentions to retain local control over their land and resources. The alignment of artifact digging and marketing with subsistence clearly marks it, from a local perspective, as an issue of cultural survival and self-determination.14 For St. Lawrence Islanders, the right to dig and sell artifacts is truly an expression of Native sovereignty. It is also a conscious decision, for now, to prioritize the economic needs of the community over the cultural value of archae ology and artifacts. Though other indigenous groups may ascribe very different (i.e. non-economic) values to archaeological materials, they nevertheless appear to sup port the actions of the islanders on the principles of sovereignty and self-determina tion. St. Lawrence Island "Digs" Resource Management The phrase above is the headline of an article written by a St. Lawrence Islander in August 1999 announcing the approval by the Island's Native corporations (after four years of studies by outside business consultants) of plans for a business designed to purchase old ivory, bone, and artifacts from local residents and sell them directly to artisans and collectors (Silook 1999). The objectives are to eliminate middlemen, stabilize prices, and make a profit with hopes of controlling the amount of old bone and ivory going into the hands of non-Native artisans. Okvik", as the business is called, eventually plans to provide certificates of authenticity, sell materials on the Internet, and possibly manufacture replicas. Some of the stated long-term goals in clude training local people in archaeological methods and techniques, scientific study and preservation of sites, and development of a world-class museum (S. Silook, personal communication 10/99). 14 Today, Alaska Natives face intense debates over subsistence rights from non-Native hunters, legislators, regulatory agencies, and developers.</page><page sequence="20">26 Revista de Arqueolog?a Americana No. 21 This solution, clearly at odds with archaeological ethics, addresses present local concerns and has potential to benefit the community and the archaeological record in the long run. One question is whether, particularly in the case of artifact sales, Okvik" will be able to return as much to local diggers as they have received through direct sales to dealers or develop successful strategies to reach buyers in the ex clusive art world of Bering Sea ivories. In 2000, St. Lawrence Island received a $114,000 grant for "ivory and bone management", and in 2001, Okvik, Inc. started buying raw materials from local diggers for resale ?no artifacts as yet. It will be in teresting to observe how this increase in local control affects the flow of archaeo logical materials onto the global market, both in the form of raw materials and as high-priced artifacts. Conclusion This article illustrates the complexity of the values, ethics and relationships involved in an artifact market that originates in one small region of the world. From a broad perspective, the situation on St. Lawrence Island is one in which the legal property rights, economic needs, and self-determination of an indigenous community and the right to engage in the global market are in conflict with cultural and intellectual val ues of archaeological heritage preservation. As one of the few legal markets in an tiquities, the situation on St. Lawrence Island tests the theory under study by UNESCO (O'Keefe 1997) and advocated by several international art dealers (Merryman 1994) that an unregulated global free market in cultural property is a better deterrent to ar chaeological site destruction than legal mechanisms that tend to stimulate a black market. At least in this case, it appears that the legal nature of the trade in Bering Strait archaeological materials has not deterred site destruction, but it has had the effect of allowing more specific provenience information to accompany artifacts that enter the market. For local decision-makers, the question becomes how to balance and integrate longstanding and vital economic needs and interests with emerging cultural heritage interests. If local people are forced to choose between selling archaeological mate rials and doing scientific archaeology, there is no question that the former will pre vail. If archaeologists want to have an effect on subsistence digging, they may have a responsibility to help implement economic alternatives in communities where this is a motive for undocumented excavation. Archaeologists the world over are learning the importance of community-based development and local decision-making for archaeological site protection (McEwan et ai 1994; Nicholas and Andrews 1997; Pyburn and Wilk 1995). Studies in conser vation and development also have some useful findings, including the concept that</page><page sequence="21">The Legal Market in Archaeological Materials from Alaska. 27 resource conservation succeeds best when indigenous communities develop their own economic alternatives and practices that also meet demands of the cash economy (Oldfield and Alcorn 1991). Today there are a growing number of examples of positive collaborations between archaeologists and indigenous communities in the Bering Strait region today. One is Roger Harritt's project that will complete its fifth season of excavation in the Na tive Village of Wales in 2002 (Figure 7). Here commercial subsistence digging (al beit, not on the scale of St. Lawrence Island) and scientific excavation cautiously but successfully co-exist within guidelines set by the Village Native Corporation and negotiated by the project director. Another is a project proposed and directed not by archaeologists, but by the Chignik Native Corporation of Golovin, Alaska. After the emotional experience of reburying human remains repatriated under NAGPRA, resi dents decided to initiate their own archaeological research and training. The Native Corporation hires its own archaeologists and together they design and direct an ar chaeological field school that includes summer employment for a number of local youth (Richter and Wessels 1999). As for the prospect of doing archaeology on St. Lawrence Island, it can either wait for the artifact market to collapse (a long wait), or archaeologists will need to corn Figure 7.
