An original and two copies must be submitted, each accompanied by photo- copies of all illustrations. Manuscripts should be paginated consecutively beginning with the title page. Content of the paper should be indicated by appropriate headings and sub- headings. A brief abstract (in both English and Spanish) of 100 to 150 words must accom- pany the paper. If this is not possible, we will translate the abstract for a small fee. The list- ing of references should include only those cited in the text. Manuscripts must be available on a disk in an IBM-compatible, DOS format, preferably Word Perfect. Do not send disk until it is requested. TABLES, FIGURES, AND ILLUSTRATIONS. Kiva printed page is 5 x 7 in. Authors should scale photographs and line art to this ratio (5:8). Line drawings should be drawn in black ink no larger than 9 x 12 in. and be suitable for 50% reduction. Photographs should be glossy prints no larger than 8 x 10 in., also suitable for 50% reduction. All figures and tables must be cited in the text, be numbered consecutively, and have descriptive titles. Each figure should be labeled on the back with the author's name and the figure number. The space used by the photographs, line art, and tables is included in the page allowance for manuscript length (see below). Authors are requested to keep all original illustrations until these materials are requested by the Editor. PAGE CHARGES. Manuscript length should not exceed an aggregate length of 30 pages, including typescript text, photographs, line art, tables, and references. A charge of $40.00 per Kiva page will be applied to papers in excess of 15 printed Kiva pages. As a general rule, two double-spaced pages of typescripts equal one printed page of Kiva. (In other words, 30 manuscript pages will be about 15 printed Kiva pages). GALLEY PROOFS AND OFFPRINTS. Galley proofs only will be sent to authors. Proofs should be read, corrected, and returned to the Editor within 48 hours of receipt. Minor alter- ations of the text in galley proofs are permitted, but major alterations will be charged to the author.
