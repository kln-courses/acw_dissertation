Introduction The discipline of theology consists of a number of sub disciplines: 'apologetics' (the defence of Christianity from attacks from the non-Christian world) requires a technique quite distinct from that of 'dogmatics' (the systematic presentation of Christian ity to a particular faith community). Apologetics demands expres sion in a language understood by the world at large, whereas dogmatics merely codifies the language of a distinct faith commun ity. Just as successful Christian mission cannot assume a prior understanding of the language of Christianity, so the contempor ary apologetic task has to enter into dialogue with the wider world. At the beginning of the present century there was little dispute at the apologetic level, with a shared perception among theologians of the threats to theology. Theological disagreement arose, how ever, when the tasks of dogmatics and apologetics were confused, with theologians themselves often appearing unclear of their audi ence and of their aims. What appeared to be apologetics was often a masked form of dogmatics, a subtle portrayal of a distinctive view of the Christian Faith, aimed at countering those with a competing view. Apologetic language with its claims to universal validity could be most effective when put to dogmatic use. The application of Kant's philosophy by theologians in the first two decades of the present century provides a clear example of such a confusion of motive and audience, with the philosopher himself often becoming the mask behind which competing views of Christianity fought out their battles. As will become clear, although Troeltsch, Otto and Bousset may have begun with similar apologetic intentions, they very soon became locked in often bitter dispute about the nature of the Christian faith. II. The Need for Apologetics By the turn of the present century the apologetic task was given a special sense of urgency by the quasi-religious fervour of the 1 I am grateful to my colleague, Professor John Rogerson, and to the Revd Robert Morgan of Linacre College, Oxford, for their helpful comments on an earlier version of this paper.

The fact that Haeckel's system clearly lacked philosophical rigour and allowed for easy criticism3 blinded many critics to his very real achievement and influence. Yet for his disciples, he was 'the greatest theologian the world has ever seen',4 and as such demanded an apologetic response from defenders of a more traditional faith which re-affirmed the primacy of the spirit against a 'monistic cosmology based on the law of substance'.5 Against Haeckel, who regarded Kant's practical philo sophy as a 'castle in the air' sullying the crystalline ('monistic') purity of theoretical reason,6 theologians had to reassert the free dom of the will and the autonomy of the human spirit. Albrecht Ritschl had earlier recognized the overwhelming importance of tackling the problems posed by materialism and positivism.7 The heart of his magnum opus is the attempt to show that the 'Christian view of the world and of life is opposed both to that produced by materialism and to those views which are 2 On Haeckel see esp. Daniel Gasman, The Scientific Origins of National Social ism, Social Darwinism in Ernst Haeckel and the German Monist League (London, 1971); and Wilhelm Boelsche, Haeckel, His Life and Work, trans. Joseph McCabe (London, 1906). 3 Rudolf Eucken, for instance, (in Geistige Stromungen der Gegenwart, (Leipzig, 1909), 170-91) asserted that, when taken to its extreme, monism 'could have no place for the concept of truth upon which science depends' (p. 190 f.). Similarly Friedrich Paulsen ridiculed the book: Ί have read the book with burning shame about the condition of the general and philosophical education of our people. It is painful that such a book was possible, that it could have been written, edited, sold, read, pondered, and believed by a people who possess a Kant, a Goethe and a Schopenhauer' ('Haeckel als Philosoph', Preufiische Jahrbùcher 101 (1900), 29—72, at p. 36).

CHAPMAN presented in monistic idealism'.8 Ritschl's separation of theology from philosophy, however, had deprived him of the resources to engage in a full-scale apologetics. His reaction to materialism was one of theological isolation with no possibility of dialogue between science and theology in a mutually comprehensible discourse: religion survived merely as a distinct form of life immune from the threats of science. For Ritschl, and even more for Wilhelm Herrmann (1846 1922),9 there could be no place for metaphysics in theology since it 'may become a rival to the distinctive revelations found in Christ'.10 Metaphysics, which claimed natural knowledge of the things of faith apart from direct revelation, and which was vital for any apologetics, was banished from the system. In distinction from his colleagues, Herrmann developed a strongly dualistic view of reality no longer able to unite the world of faith with the world of science.11 As Troeltsch observed: On the one hand [Herrmann] allows full validity to the enormous world in its mechanical causal nexus of events, and leaves it alone, and then allows the religious person simply a religious and ethical autonomy which is based on the experience of God's holiness and love in the picture of Jesus.12 Apologetics had to avoid succumbing to such a dualism: theo logy had to defend religion without isolating it. It had to show itself to be part of the same reality as was open to investigation by the empirical sciences, yet not be explained away by these sciences. Although Herrmann had recognized the threat he had not provided the ammunition for the counter-offensive. 8 The Christian Doctrine of Justification and Reconciliation, Pt.

Thus he asserted in a famous phrase: 'theology without metaphysics is impossible',13 a phrase that was echoed by many others.14 For instance, according to Max Reischle: Systematic theology had once more to search for an understanding of the thought forms of our time as these are mirrored in philosophy. Indeed it must do more than this: It must submerse itself in philosophical labour, for it is only possible to gain a scientific understanding of the Christian Faith, its foundations and its content, in the context of the methodical research into the whole of intellectual life and its essential functions.15 The absolute distinction between faith and knowledge implied by Herrmann's 'revelatory positivism'16 was artificial and could serve no apologetic task.17 Instead, theology had to return to the study of its epistemological basis which meant a decisive meta physical turn,18 a definite orientation towards a total view of the world and an integrated attitude towards life. More precisely such an orientation points beyond the entirety of what is immediately given to us, beyond, that is, the world that is determined empirically.19 13 Georg Wobbermin, Théologie und Metaphysik.

CHAPMAN According to Wobbermin, the scientific study of religion could never establish the truth of religion. The empirical method which was 'of such great merit' had to be 'expanded by critical epistemo logical thought using transcendental psychological procedures'.20 Similarly, Troeltsch, although regarding William James21 as of the 'utmost freshness and originality',22 and Wundt as 'providing a scientific presupposition for the possibility and the discussion of the specifically religious',23 saw empirical psychology as merely the 'entrance gate to epistemology'.24 He remarked in a lecture: 'the fact that we have an idea says nothing about whether it is true . . . Truth or non-truth is no longer a psychological ques tion'.25 Pragmatism was no substitute for epistemology,26 since 'complete relativism results where there is merely psychology and no criterion of the validity of religion, since there is neither super natural revelation nor rational criteria and necessity'.27 Without epistemology psychology was a 'purely provisional description and analysis of the phenomena',28 or a 'highly indefinite, relative description which piles up various characteristics'.29 In short, the question of 'ultimate truth or highest reality' moved beyond mere empirical analysis to the question of epistemology.30 20 Aufgabe und Bedeutung der Religionspsychologie (Berlin, 1910) 7 f. 21 See esp.

Indeed with this question of universal validity (Allgemeingultigkeit) theo logy 'stands or falls'.33 Other theologians soon saw the deficiencies of Ritschl's attempt to separate theology and metaphysics and demanded that the 'unity of the spiritual life be not torn apart'.34 Julius Kaftan (1848 1926),35 for instance, sought to confront the modern world on its own terms and thoroughly immersed himself in philosophical and scientific literature. He was 'distinguished from the other members of the [Ritschlian] school by the earnestness of his attempts to find a means of adjustment between faith and theoretic knowledge which may avoid the appearance of collision between them'.36 Against Ritschl's denial of metaphysics, Kaftan asserted that the Christian Faith was: the true knowledge of the First Cause and of the final purpose of all things, ... it offers just what philosophy has sought as the highest knowledge, or as the solution to the enigma of the world . . . The task is no other than that of proving that the knowledge supplied by Christianity as the First Cause and final purpose of all things is true.37 For Kaftan, 'evangelical faith and empirical science belong together in a unified conception and are shown to be necessary members of a greater whole which is the personal spirit'.38 31 Ibid. 30. 32 Ibid. 59.

Examples of Apologetics (i) Rudolf Otto Once armed with a possible method for apologetics theologians set about the twofold task of defending the Christian Faith from the naturalistic assault. First, they had to ensure the survival of religion as a distinct aspect of human life by showing its independ ence and self-sufficiency, and second, they had to present its neces sity for human life by showing how the survival of human freedom and spiritual life depended on a religious picture of reality. These two aspects of the apologetic task often ran parallel: the assertion of religion as self-sufficient often meant proving its necessity. It was perhaps Rudolf Otto (1869-1937)39 more than anybody else who defended the religious dimension of human life from the onslaught of naturalism and materialism. From as early as 1899 in the preface to his centenary edition of Schleiermacher's Reden,i0 he recognized the need to respond to the threats to religion posed by 'l'homme machine' of the French Enlightenment; despite the great advances in science during the eighteenth century, there was one dimension which had been neglected, namely human piety.41 Schleiermacher's contemporary relevance rested in his delineation of religion as its 'own free arena of human being'.42 Alongside the principles of the 'Kantian catechism' of the first two Critiques, ('What can we know?' and, 'What should we do?'), he had inserted a third, namely, 'What do we experience in the soul?' Against all interpretations that attempted to reduce Schleiermacher to some form of 'eclectic "ism"', Otto pointed to his originality in relocat ing 'piety' at the centre of human life.43 This re-assertion of the 39 On Otto see R.

Without falling back again into the trammels of a primitive supernaturalism he prepared the way to a rediscovery not only of religion but of Christian religion and to a new interpretation of Christian religion, which was better and more modern than the old orthodox or rationalistic theology could give.46 The emphasis on the spiritual dimension as both an independent and a necessary sphere of human life is at the centre of Otto's Naturalistische und religiose Weltansicht, which offers a thorough discussion of materialism and its impact on the religious world view.47 This attempts not to counter materialism with quasi scientific proofs, but seeks to show that a proper understanding of the natural sciences leads to the 'fresh revelation of the depth of things . . . the increased recognition that our knowledge is only leading us towards mystery'.48 Against Darwinism with its 68—77- This is a revised version of 'Wie Schleiermacher die Religion wieder entdeckte' in CW 17 (1903), 506-12. 44 Reden, 173. 45 It is interesting to note that Otto asserts the primacy of the supra-rational from at least as early as the time of this new edition of Schleiermacher's Reden, but possibly even from his doctoral thesis on Luther and the Holy Spirit, as maintained by Hans-Walter Schiitte, op cit, esp. p. 12. 46 'How Schleiermacher rediscovered the sensus numinous', 77. 4' Naturalistische und religiose Weltansicht (Tubingen, 1904).

CHAPMAN emphasis on 'explanation',49 Otto asserts the importance of the mysterious, of the feeling of 'dependence', a term borrowed from the 'profound insight' of Schleiermacher,50 and concludes by affirming the autonomy of the spirit, that mysterious power which activates itself in nature and which no amount of knowledge in the natural sciences could ever 'rob it of its freedom and inde pendence'.51 Otto's book is thus a defence of the depths of feeling which rest beyond the limits of naturalistic explanation:52 This world of feeling is for us the meaning of all existence. The more we plunge ourselves into it, the deeper are the intricacies and mysteries it reveals. At every point underivable and unintelligible in terms of physio logical processes, it reveals itself from stage to stage as more deeply and wholly unique in its relations, interactions, and processes, and grows farther and farther beyond the laboured and insufficient schemes and formulae under which science desires to range all psychical phenomena.53 Otto considered his work as apologetics, not because religion had to go on the defensive before the challenge of science (since, for him, science implied a religious viewpoint), but rather: Our undertaking only becomes defensive and critical because, not from caprice or godlessness, but, as we shall see, from an inherent necessity, the natural sciences, in association with other convictions and aims, tend readily to unite into a distinctive and independent system of world interpretation, which if it were valid and sufficient, would drive the religious view into difficulties, or make it impossible. This independent system is Naturalism, and against its attacks the religious conception of the world has to stand on the defensive.54 19 Naturalism and Religion, 46 f. 50 Ibid. 41. 51 Ibid. 276. 52 In JFR (p. 222/ET, p. 124) Otto emphasizes the centrality of the concept of mystery in Fries' philosophy: 'The doctrine of the necessary mysteries of religion seems to me one of the finest and most delicate in Fries' philosophy'. Cf. Schlitte, op. cit. 33: 'Rudolf Otto as a theologian was never satisfied with purely rational thought, as it might at first appear on a superficial reading. It is no accident that the concept of the mysterium is central even in his early work on "Naturalism and Religion".' The background to Otto's thought, particularly the influence of Schlei ermacher, is discussed by Almond in 'Rudolf Otto: The Context of His Thought' SJT 36 (1983) 347—62. For Bousset, too, 'trembling fear' was at the heart of all real religion (What is Religion? tr. F. B. Law (London, 1907), 22) and even Troeltsch saw 'the sense of mystery as the soul of all religion' ('Religionsphiloso phie' in Die Philosophie im Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts, ed. W.

In his 1897 response to the Gottingen materialistic philosopher, Baumann, whose theory 'of the empti ness of the spirit ' mirrored 'the actual emptying of spiritual life',57 Troeltsch commenced his 'fight against disbelief in the Spirit',58 confidently proclaiming that 'whoever has confidence in the realm of the spirit is never far from the Kingdom of God'.59 Theology had to 'reawaken interest in the imagination, the heart and the soul'60 in an intellectual class which believed itself 'definitively freed' from thought of the inner person. Similarly, in opposition to Haeckel's 'Gospel of Monism',61 Troeltsch affirmed the need for a philosophical system 'worth its salt' which recognises the portrayal of the spirit before nature, where the seemingly so dead and deadly mechanical rigidity of the facts of nature can embody the warm and restless life of the spirit.62 Apologetics thus required a philosophy which 'makes room for religion to breathe',63 since every claim to religion 'expresses . . . 55 'Religionswissenschaft und Théologie des 18.

CHAPMAN the stimulus of an objective world of the spirit'.64 The fight against Haeckel was a fight for the spirit, which Troeltsch confidently felt he would win since Christian 'personalism' 'played havoc with every system of thoroughgoing rationalism'.65 Indeed, Haeckel's philosophy was nothing more than one of 'the gigantic ephemeral successes of triviality which keep returning but which are always dissolved by future triviality'.66 Like Otto, Troeltsch addressed the question of whether religion was 'nothing more than a collection of many parallel, different sides',67 of whether it was only a combination of other conditions, or whether it had its own inde pendent essence like logical thought, ethical judgement or aesthetic appre ciation, that is, whether it is secondary or primary.68 In answering this question Troeltsch similarly pointed to Schleier macher's 'theory of feeling as up till today the correct solution which only needs working out'.69 In 'working out' Schleiermach er's romantic theory, however, he subjected it to a far more thor ough philosophical treatment. IV. 'Back to Kant' In his philosophical refinement of Schleiermacher, Troeltsch immersed himself in the study of Kant, an almost universally shared occupation of the period. Kant had 'influenced many scholars who were not professional philosophers. [His] position affected almost every aspect of German learning at some level of theoretical justification'.70 Despite the tremendous growth in the biological and psychological sciences, 'sciences which Kant hardly knew',71 Troeltsch recognized the great wealth of apologetic resources in Kant's thought,72 and viewed the 'back to Kant' movement as nothing less than the renewed awareness of 'the burning issue' of 'the problem of freedom, which was continually 64 Τroeltsch, The Absoluteness of Christianity and the History of Religion, trans.

Discussion of Kant had never entirely disappeared during the nineteenth century as is clearly shown in the detailed study by Klaus Christian Kohnke, Entstehung und Aufstieg des Neukantianismus: Die deutsche Universitàtsphilosophie zwischen ldealismus und Positivismus (Frankfurt am-Main, 1986).

Eric Matthews (Cambridge, 1984), Ch. 3. The most important reaction to the 'physiological' interpretations of Kant (perhaps best exemplified by Helmholtz) was F. A. Lange's magnum opus, Geschichte des Materialismus, published from 1866 onwards (new edn, Frankfurt, 1974). The rise of 'scientism' is admirably charted by John Theo dore Merz, A History of European Thought in the Nineteenth Century, vol. 3 (London, 1912); repr. (New York, 1965). 76 Although August Dorner's 'Volksmetaphysik' (in his Grundrifi der Religion sphilosophie (Leipzig, 1903)), for instance, still looks to Hegel, the impact of Dilthey within the historical sciences indicates most clearly the end of the Hegelian hege mony.

CHAPMAN The activities surrounding the centenary of his death in 190482 brought about increased interest in Kant amongst theologians with, according to Reischle, 'good reason, for in fact Kant's influ ence in theology and its development has been of great impor tance'.83 He goes on to point to his continuing importance as a philosopher who had made philosophy into a methodical labour. Kant did not want to teach a philosophy but a means of philosophising. It thus depends less on picking up the actual results of his philosophy than on standing in the footsteps of his method of working. In this connection in particular we are Kantians and are able to say that he is the magister of modern theology and that a tenere magistrum is possible even when one distances oneself from his results.84 From almost all quarters it was observed that Kant was relevant for the contemporary tasks of philosophy: The cry 'back to Kant' has now for many years been the almost universal cry in Germany. It is now felt that the absolutist and idealistic line of development of Kant's doctrines was not the true line for philosophy to take . . . The cry, however, if it is not to be misleading, must be understood to mean. Begin where Kant began, examine again the facts, not in order simply to adopt, but in order to verify, and in Kant's own sense criticize, his distinction between things-in-themselves and Phen omena. Use that distinction solely as a lantern to the path.85 This notion of Kant as the foundation, and all philosophy as mere embellishment and modification characterizes German philosoph ical life at the turn of the present century.86 As Windelband put 82 Hans Vaihinger, (in 'Das Kantjubilaum im Jahre 1904' (KS 10 (1905), ι°5—55)) gives an account of the almost religious acts of veneration ('Sâkulierfeier') of the February 12th celebrations. No fewer than fifty-six special articles together with six important German Festschriften (pp. 146-50) appeared in the year 1904, 'a fact which goes to prove that Kant is still a power today' (p. 105). He also (in 'An die Freunde der Kantischen Philosophie: Bericht fiber die Begrfindung einer "Kantgesellschaft" und die Errichtung einer "Kantstiftung" zum hundertjâhrigen Todestag des Philosophen' in the Kant-Studien Festheft, eds. Hans Vaihinger and Bruno Bauch, published in celebration on 12 February 1904 (KS 9 (1904), 344-50)) reports on the founding of the Kant-Gesellschaft. Particularly striking is the gener osity of the donations to the Kantstiftung. By 1912 the Gesellschaft had 400 members. 83 Max Reischle, 'Kant und die Theologie der Gegenwart', 357. 84 Ibid. 387 f. 85 Shadworth H. Hodgson, 'The Centenary of Kant's Death' in Proceedings of the British Academy (1904), 181. 86 The publication of many hitherto unavailable sources and the gradual appear ance of the Akademieausgabe, did, however, lead to a revival of biographical and philological interest in Kant himself. Cf. for example, Albert Schweitzer, Die Religionsphilosophie Kant's von der 'Kritik der reinen Vernunft' bis zur fReligion innerhalb der Grenzen der blossen Vernunft' (Freiburg i.Br., Leipzig and Tfibingen, 1899) for a close philological study of the development between the great First Critique and the later work on religion.</page><page sequence="14">APOLOGETICS AND THE RELIGIOUS A PRIORI 483 it in a famous maxim: 'Kant verstehen heiBt fiber ihn hinaus gehen',87 since 'after [Kant] there was essentially nothing new'.88 It was this method that Troeltsch adopted as the foundation for his constructive theological and philosophical tasks. As he put it in his important St Louis lecture of 1904: The problem was put by [Kant] in a fundamental way, and his solutions need nothing more than modification and completion . . . The ideas of Hume and Leibniz must once more be brought into relation with the continuation of Kant's work, and the combination of the Anglo-Saxon sense for reality with the German sense for the speculative is still the task for the new century as well as for the century past.89 Thus, in answering the question, 'Wo bleibt Kant?', he asserted 'Kant bleibt im Ansatz'.90 Indeed without Kant and his epistemo logical method, all philosophy of religion became 'just as crass superstition as the papal encyclicals',91 or, more prosaically: 'the Kantian answer remains in principle the right solution'.92 V. The Religious a priori It was thus Kantian terminology, or more specifically the elusive 'religious a priori', which dominated apologetics in the first dec ades of the century.93 The leading question for apologetics became, according to Troeltsch, 'either origin of religion out of the psycho logical illusion of positivism ... or the foundation of religion in an a priori of consciousness'.94 As E. W. Mayer exclaimed in 1912: 'The "religious a priori" !! It is astonishing how the programme which is embodied by this catch-phrase has captivated the theological youth of today'.95 He could quite understand such fascination, however, since 'the programme points not merely to Ernst Troeltsch, but also to a great shadow, the "armoured shadow" of Kant, as Treitschke liked to call him'.96 Thus, in a 87 Windelband, Pràludien, I, p. vi.

CHAPMAN sense, the religious a priori 'carried the whole of the philosophy of religion'.97 There was, however, profound disagreement on what the reli gious a priori implied epistemologically: for some, it was nothing less than an 'attempt to form a substitute for a natural theology',98 whereas for others, it was merely a preliminary delineation of the phenomenon of religion prior to epistemological evaluation. Such confusion meant that it soon became an 'ambiguous catch phrase'99 or a 'very cloudy notion'.100 Herrmann found such a confusion in the work of Troeltsch: Whoever wishes to express experience on the one hand, and the Idea or the principle on the other, expresses two conflicting conceptions of reli gion. Whoever wishes to represent them both together achieves a confus ing word-play which is today exemplified by the phrase 'a priori of religion' which Troeltsch proposes.101 Rudolf Otto, although continuing to use the expression, was well aware of its shortcomings, and regarded it as a 'not particularly fortunate expression which is beset with misunderstandings'.102 Despite this lack of clarity, however, what is evident is that the religious a priori was intended as the application of a modified Kantianism for the purposes of theological apologetics. VI. The Concept of the a priori For Kant a priori concepts were the conditions without which the apodictic certainty of the empirical sciences would not be possible, '[for] only by means of these fundamental concepts can appearances belong to knowledge or even to our consciousness and thus to ourselves'.103 They were those concepts without which no object could be thought, but were not themselves derived from experience: 'on the contrary, they have to confer upon appearances their conformity to law, and so to make experience possible'.104 97 Kôhler, op. cit. 2. 98 Walter Bodenstein, Der Neige des Historismus: Ernst Troeltschs Entwicklungs gang (Giitersloh, 1959), 30. 99 Wilhelm Mundle, 'Das religiose Apriori in der Religionsphilosophie Trôltschs in seinem Verhâltnis zu Kant' in Th.St.Kr. 89 (1916), 427-70, at p. 428. 100 Fr.

'We must be able to show how pure concepts can be applicable to appear ances.'106 The categories of pure reason required transcendental schemata if they were to be applied to sensibility.107 As Troeltsch put it in an article on Kant: a priori concepts had to do with empirical data alone and 'if employed apart from and beyond them [they] remain altogether empty—a use of them which results in a futile metaphysical hypostasis, such as was fabricated by Plato, and, in a more cautious and covert manner, by Leibniz'.108 For Kant, philosophical problems arose when knowledge was sought in the realm of pure reason without application in concrete,109 something which would lead to a necessary antinomy. For instance, the thesis of pure reason that 'the world has a beginning' enters into a necessary antinomy with the antithesis 'that the world has no beginning, and no limits in space' (The First Antinomy). It was, however, the so-called Third Antinomy which was of special importance in ethics and the philosophy of religion. The thesis: 'Causality in accordance with the laws of nature is not the only causality from which the appearances of the world can one and all be derived. To explain these appearances it is necessary to assume that there is also another causality, that of freedom' was in opposition to the antithesis that 'There is no freedom; everything takes place solely in accordance with laws of nature.'110 In his Critique of Practical Reason Kant reaffirmed his interest in human freedom, as a higher form of motivation than that of mere deterministic necessity. In the realm of practical reason (human action) as in pure reason there were regulative ideas (or postulates) which determined the nature of moral judgement, and conferred on them a universal logical character. What seemed to be lacking, however, was that necessary status of the categories of pure reason. There were merely parallel causalities, the one of human willing and the other of the rigid determinism of scientific judgement, but no bridge between the two and thus no solution 105 Ag3 = Bi25· 106 Ai38 = Bi77. 107 Αΐ47 = Βι87· 108 Τroeltsch, 'Kant' in ERE, vol.

It was this problem that he tackled, albeit only tentatively, in his Critique of Judgement,m where he attempted to bring the world of cause and effect into harmony with the causality of freedom, a harmony introduced by the judging faculty of the human being as the world was shown to conform to patterns detected by the human being. There were thus great theological resources in Kant's philo sophy: first, although he may not have solved the problem of human freedom, he had at least recognized it as a problem and had not attempted to explain it away in Humean scepticism. Secondly, he provided the terminology for looking at the logical form of empirical and non-empirical judgements, and finally, he offered a tentative solution to the problem of freedom and deter minism. One of the reasons why the religious a priori became such a misunderstood concept was that it was used both as a substitute for the tentative solution to the Third Antinomy mooted by Kant in his Third Critique, and, at the same time, the mere delineation or 'stabilization'112 of the logical form of religion as a distinct form of life alongside the scientific, moral, and aesthetic.113 The reli gious a priori thus became simultaneously a distinctively religious form of judgement which would also unify freedom and determin ism. There were thus at least two distinct levels in the philosoph ical debate over the religious a priori which were often confused and misunderstood, not least by the proponents themselves. VII. Ernst Troeltsch, the Religious a priori and the Shift to Dogmatics Troeltsch, for instance, operates at both these levels: his primary concern was the 'critical regulation' of the 'uncultivated psychical life' which would confer on the amorphous 'religious feeling' a greater logical clarity which did not reduce it to some epiphenom enon.114 His aim was to show 'whether the religious function of consciousness attains the character of the a priori',115 It was Kant who, 'with the most fundamental coherence, undertook the ana lysis of consciousness in general, making it his fundamental pro 111 Immanuel Kant, The Critique of Judgement, trans. James Creed Meredith (Oxford, 1952). 112 Cf. Mayer, op. cit. 60. 113 Kant would himself never have countenanced such a claim. Troeltsch sug gested that he had avoided introducing a specific religious a priori because he 'saw all the dangers of mysticism lurking in it' (MP p. 287, PE, p. 54). 114 MP, p. 288, PE, p. 54 f. 115 MS Religionsphilosophie, 51.</page><page sequence="18">APOLOGETICS AND THE RELIGIOUS A PRIORI 487 position and under this allocation, religion was given a defined place in the economy of consciousness'.116 Thus: science of religion allows religion to exist as religion and regulates it according to its own a priori which permeates the great historical centres of revelation with ever greater clarity and undertakes the task of closely connecting it with the rest of reason.117 Such a delineation of religion in terms of a religious a priori provoked an immediate reaction from those influenced by Herr mann for whom there was room for either the 'a priori law of reason, or the living God of religion',118 but never a combination of the two since Kantian epistemology was applicable only to the sphere of science. Thus the 'special means of knowing . . . where the experience of subjective certainty nevertheless has the charac ter of objective necessity',119 was replaced 'with a rational proof'.120 In short: We deny an intellectual, rational a priori based on compelling grounds. It contradicts the essence of religion which is always irrational.121 To counter these charges that he had rationalised religion, Troeltsch wrote 'Zur Frage des religiôsen Apriori',122 as a vigorous defence of the irrational content of religion, and continually affirmed the need for a 'deed of the will', an irrational decision to accept the validity of the religious a priori.l23 Indeed, in the last resort, a deed was responsible for all knowledge.124 It was in the act that doubt was overcome and not by any religious or rational 116 'Religionsphilosophie' 143. 117 MP, p. 287, PE, p. 53. 118 R.

This was nothing less than 'a decision about the value of our very being'.125 He thus sought to show himself more Protestant than his opponents and, at the same time, to show that with his method one could pursue a legitimate apologetics and remain untainted by natural theology. The delineation of a religious a priori could, however, never prove the existence of the religious object, since 'if we want a scientific proof of God then we are back with theories that Kant destroyed'.126 Similarly it could not take on the hard and fast character of the categories of pure reason but would be 'obliged unceasingly to correct itself, and contain open spaces',127 since, in the realm of human freedom there was no 'ready system of categor ical forms, but only developing forms and approximations'.128 The religious a priori, which Troeltsch defined as that form of judge ment sub specie aeternitatis129 was necessarily subject to human error and illusion: 'The true and rational reality to be attained by thought is always in conjunction with the untrue reality, the psychological, that containing illusion and error'.130 Thus 'the two realities, which the critical system must recognise at its very foundation, continue in strife with each other'.131 In introducing the notion of 'openness' Troeltsch aimed to make Kant's categories 'fit life, not to abolish them altogether and put the chaos of reality into their place'.132 VIII. The Solution to the Third Antinomy From the delineation of the religious form of judgement, Tro eltsch moved on to the attempt to overcome the parallelism of the Third Antinomy, seeing the religious a priori as 'carrying' the other a prioris, conferring on them a sense of unity. Just as Kant, in the Critique of Judgement,133 had provided a basis for overcom 125 MS Religionsphilosophie, 63. 126 MS Religionsphilosophie, 54. 127 MP, p. 280, PE p. 32. 128 MS Religionsphilosophie, 53. 129 It is not true, as Ansgar Paus (in Religioser Erkenntnisgrund, Herkunft und Wesen der Aprioritheorie Rudolf Ottos (Leiden, 1966), 135) and Garrett Paul (in 'Religionswissenschaft' : The development of Ernst Troeltsch's Philosophy of Religion, 18Ç5-IQ14 (diss., Chicago, 1980), 103) maintain that Troeltsch gave no content to the specific form of the religious judgement, even if it was vague and imprecise. 130 'Contingency', 89. 131 MP, p. 281, PE, p. 32 f. 132 'Empiricism and Platonism', p. 422.

This</page><page sequence="20">APOLOGETICS AND THE RELIGIOUS A PRIORI 489 ing the antinomy practically by reading a teleological purpose into nature, so the religious a priori became a 'unity of spirit against the flowing stream of life',134 whereby both causalities were seen as part of one greater absolute reality. Without the perception of the absolute, everything remained in flux: When we connect matter and spirit to one another in the theoretical functions; when we unite that which is diffuse, we can only do this because we have experienced this unity in the religious consciousness.135 By introducing unity into the Kantian parallelism the religious a priori became the 'tacit immanent presupposition of all value functions'.136 The very conception of a unified reality itself became a religious viewpoint as the religious a priori 'connected divine and human reason',137 and the 'supersensuous had the effect of permeating the natural phenomenal life of the soul'.138 In this way Kant's thought led to an 'energetic theism'.139 Or, as Rudolf Otto put it: In so far as the pure capacity for knowledge in Kant is preconscious and subconscious, and all perceptions of unity, meaning and value rise from the depth of the mind which itself lies far below the level of the senses and of the understanding, Kant also knows the 'ground of the soul'.140 Troeltsch modified Kant by overcoming the Third Antinomy as the 'intelligible ego', the initiator of willed action, interacted with the world of cause and effect: Within the phenomenal ego by a creative act of the intelligible ego in it, the personality should be formed and developed as a realisation of the autonomous reason, so that the intelligible issues from the phenomenal, the rational from the psychological, the former elaborates and shapes the latter, and between both, a relation of regular interaction, but not of causal constraint, takes place.141 legislation, therefore, is what alone qualifies him to be a final end to which entire nature is teleologically subordinated' (p. 453 f.). 134 Karl Bornhausen, 'Das religiosen Apriori bei Ernst Troeltsch und Rudolf Otto' (test lecture in Marburg, 11 Jan. 1910) in Zeitschrift fur Philosophie und Philosophische Kritik 139 (1910), 193-206, at p. 194. 135 MS Religionsphilosophie, 60. 136 Ibid. 137 Ruth Schlesinger, 'Problème eines religiosen Apriori', unpublished diss.

CHAPMAN In meaningful action, in praxis, the human will thus overcame the Third Antinomy. There could be no proofs for this interaction except in the decision of the will to accept the meaningful organis ation of consciousness, the possibility of purposeful behaviour, to accept 'something unconditioned ... in every act of thought'.142 Yet ultimately such a solution, however much it might be couched in philosophical language, rested on an 'ethical decision of the will . . . Only this can conquer scepticism'.143 For Troeltsch, this was at the heart of religion: Kant had himself often enough practically felt this, and spoke of freedom as an experience of communion with the supersensuous as a possible but unprovable affair.144 Troeltsch's religious solution was ably summarised by Wilhelm Mundle: Through our thought we search for the depths of being in nature and history; through our will we grasp the elevated heights of the ethical ought. Through our imagination we know ourselves to be carried into a realm where the conflict between is and ought, idea and reality is over come, but this realm is only a dream, an illusion, which cannot last— only through religious faith can we succeed in really solving the conflict.145 Troeltsch sees in Kant the basis for that 'religious longing to be free over and against naturalist determinism',146 where the worlds of nature and freedom 'belong together', not out of neces sity, but in 'the synthesis of natural conditions with value or meaning or freedom',14' as 'the human personality rose out of oppressive forces'.148 IX. The a priori as the Goal of History Having provided the basis for the interaction of the phenomenal and the intelligible egos, Troeltsch then moved on to the applica tion of the religious a priori to concrete historical religion, to the question of how the religious a priori, as the assertion of the 'final valid goal', was to be realized in history.149 As he makes clear in 142 Troeltsch, 'Die Selbstandigkeit der Religion' Z.Th.K.$ (1895), 431. 143 Id., Review of Nelson in TLZ, 38 (1913), cols. 341-2, at col. 342. 144 MP, p. 283, PE. p. 38. 145 Mundle, op. cit. 470. 148 Troeltsch, 'Christentum und Religionsgeschichte' in GSII, 328-63, at P· 332 147 Id., Der Historismus und seine Problème.

Against the domin ant interpretation of Kant of the Marburg School, Troeltsch aimed to show how, 'from Kant's basic view-point, a doctrine of the principles of historical research and the epistemological value of history can be attained'.151 In short: The more philosophical thinkers of the present give up the tendency to achieve a one-sided world-view of natural laws and see . . . the contents and values of the spiritual as at least as important for the formation of the total view, so the philosophical treatment of history, as the sphere of values, will become all the more important.152 Τroeltsch emphasises the regulative character of reason for his torical religion, something which is 'deeply rooted in Kant's thought, in his philosophy of history, in his political-judicial as well as in his scientific-rational convictions, in his idea of vocation in a century of progress'.153 For Kant, all tradition, however sacred, was to be subjected to rational criticism in the public domain, something which did not threaten religion, but which 'gives us freedom, peace and confidence',154 as human beings gradually approached absolute truth. Thus: The philosopher needs a connection with theology in order to make pure religion practical, and the theologian needs a connection with the philo sophy of religion in order to make biblical theology scientific.155 Absolute truth would, however, never be reached since it is not only unknowable by man, but this kind of 'truth' is absolutely imposs ible because of the vital, changing character of our world . . . where . . . there are increasingly new and vital attempts to construe the essential nature of reality which is ever in process of development.156 In short: 'the absolute is with God: all human truth is relative . . . We believe in approximation'.157 It was the duty of the contempor ary theologian to move to an 'ever more approximate'158 realization 150 'Das Historische in Kants Religionsphilosophie: Zugleich ein Beitrag zu den Untersuchungen iiber Kants Philosophie der Geschichte' in Zu Kants Gedachtnis.

CHAPMAN of the religious a priori in history, even though it could never be achieved in its fullness. Troeltsch thus saw himself as developing Kant's dictum that 'the historical serves only as illustration, not as demonstration'.159 Despite this idea of approximation, however, empirical history was vital for any religion, since 'without a means of expression there is no community; without an organised community there is no durability and no power for life for the new religion'.160 Here Troeltsch extends Kant's doctrine of schematization: Religion is not a freely created product of the understanding but an expression of the fundamental laws of reason. It has rational necessity but is never an independent reality cut off from all sensibility and psycho logical intensity ... It needs an anthropomorphic picture, or schematism of analogy, or sensory symbols through which it is first mediated, is given the power to motivate, is organised and is lived.161 A religion 'within the limits of reason alone' was quite impossible since all the religious a priori could achieve was a 'purification of positive religions through a religion of reason' but never their replacement.162 According to Troeltsch, even Kant's own doctrine of religion does not therefore look to an unconditional religion of reason, but rather to a transformation and approximation of the faith of the Church to the religion of reason, as this is demanded by the contemporary situation.163 Against those who charged him with setting up a rational reli gion,164 Troeltsch asserted: The religious a priori should only serve in order to establish the essential in empirical appearance, but without stripping off the appearance alto gether, and from this point of the essential, to correct the intricacies and the narrowness, the errors and false combinations of the psychical situation.165 The human being could never fully grasp the rational a priori of religion since all human efforts were subject to error: 'What will happen in a thousand years time nobody can know.'166 In short: 159 Ibid. 154. 160 Ibid. 143. 161 Ibid. 140. 162 Ibid. 130. 163 Troeltsch, Review of Kalweit in KS 10 (1905), 166-70, at p. 169. 164 D.

There is no idea of a religion which could be conceived without the historical, but there again there is nothing purely historical which is purely historical . . . The pursuit of the pure Idea, the rationalistic Ideal, is nonsense.167 This application of the religious a priori to history soon became the object of violent attack. A conception of Christianity as capable of full realization only at some unknowable point lacked the epi stemological security after which many clamoured. Troeltsch seemed to have been entranced by his own Kantian historicism, a historicism which his critics sought to overcome by adopting another very different form of Kantianism. Again, it was Kant who became an unlikely target and an unlikely weapon in the most violent theological polemics. X. Rudolf Otto, Wilhelm Bousset and the Religious a priori: Back to Fries168 For Rudolf Otto, as for Troeltsch, the religious a priori func tioned as a solution to 'the absolute mystery' at the heart of the Christian Gospel, the dualism of freedom and determinism. This is clear in an early work on the life of Jesus where he reflects on the healing ministry: Perhaps Christ's gift of healing which seems so mysterious to us, was 'only' a development of capabilities slumbering in human nature in gen eral. The prime instance of the effective influence of a psychical agent upon a physical reality, is the power of the will to move the body: a spiritual cause producing a mechanical result. This is an absolute mystery; and were it not so common it would still be recognised as such.169 Otto could not countenance the isolation of religion from science of the Herrmann school but sought to overcome such dualism: 167 Troeltsch, Glaubenslehre nach Heidelberger Vorlesungen aus den Jahrert içii und igi2, ed. Gertrud von le Fort (Munich and Leipzig, 1925), 93. 168 On the background to Otto's theory of the religious a priori see esp.

CHAPMAN Instead of a simple parallelism, the conviction gains ground that nature and natural processes are inadequate appearances, an incomplete picture of true things conditioned by a limited comprehension . . . [They were an] inadequate image of the true world, which is a world free from natural law, from mathematics and mechanics, a world of the mind, of minds, a 'realm of grace', a world of God.170 Similarly, for Wilhelm Bousset (1865-1920),171 there was a need to show, against the shallowness of modern science, that the depths of reality could be expressed only in a religious world-view: In today's society, the will to reflect on the ultimate truths of life has largely disappeared if we exclude those areas where dogma and authority rule. And in its place so much else has become vital: a one-sided stress on economic group or class interest, grabbing the rewards of the day; . . . added to this is a one-sided aestheticism which lacks seriousness and which, like the butterfly, sucks now from one flower and now from the next, continually clamouring after something new.172 Both Bousset and Otto set about the apologetic task of showing a world beyond that of cause and effect which displayed a higher unity. Like Troeltsch, they considered themselves to be adapting Kant, but claimed no originality for their modifications, seeing themselves as standing in the footsteps of 'the genius',173 J. F. Fries (1773—1843), whom Otto saw as attempting a philosophical refinement of Schleiermacher but in the process deepening him almost beyond recognition:174 In reality it is not so much what unites Fries with Schleiermacher as what separates them that makes Fries of particular interest in the study of religion. Even where they agree he is quite original and a closer look shows him to be more comprehensive, profound and plausible.175 Or, as Bousset put it in a moment of hagiographie adoration: I would very much like to add my personal confession that I have not come across many human beings who have so touched the heart and mind "» JFR, p. ss/ET p. 42. 171 For a bibliography and comprehensive account of Bousset's life see A.

F. Fries. In him there is at once clear and sober understanding, heroic enthusiasm and ethical duty; fine humanity in the sense of Schiller is there along with an open-mindedness for the new realism which flowed into German life from the natural sciences, technology and political life; he combines a proud inner certainty with a sacrificial enthusiasm for all the great questions of the nation, an austere reserve with extraordinarily sensitive personal love; and above all this shines a bright light of piety which unifies all clarity of thought, depths of conscience and formidable ethical power.176 It was Fries who 'stood in the midst of a new spiritual spring which was bestowed on Germany'.177 In short, 'it was a wonderful time when Fries wrote; it was the daybreak of the ascent of national freedom' when a tabula rasa was made of the past.178 In this call for a return to Friesian epistemology, Otto shared much with his Gdttingen colleague, Leonard Nelson, who saw Fries' epistemology as 'the most important philosophical labour since the appearance of the Kantian writings up till the present day'.178 In turn, Otto regarded Nelson as leaving a great 'impres sion on contemporary "epistemology" and perhaps even creating a new epoch'.180 As Nelson himself pointed out, Wilhelm Bousset had read his work 'with great interest . . . and it would seem with great understanding ... If this interest persists I do not think it will be very difficult to bring him over to our point of view. That would be a valuable acquisition'.181 There was a flurry of interest in Fries in the first decade of the present century with new editions of the most important works,182 together with the re-founding of the Abhandlungen der Fries'schen Schule183 which might 'really mean his resurrection to new life and to a powerful influence'.184 Although he appeared to offer 176 'Anwendung', 487. 177 Foreword to Julius und Evagoras, p. xvii. 178 Ibid. p. xxxi. 179 Nelson, LJber das sogenannten Erkenntnisproblem (Gôttingen, 19302), 725. 180 Otto, Review of Nelson, in CW 22 (1909), cols. 475—76, at col. 475. Karl Bornhausen, on the other hand, criticized Nelson for rejuvenating the confusion between the a posteriori psychological knowledge and the a priori realm of pure reason. His book merely served to confuse Kantian teaching and belonged 'to one of those unsatisfactory writings; writings where one is never quite certain that one has correctly understood the author' ('Wider den Neofriesianismus in der Théolo gie', in Z.Th.K. 20 (1910), 341-405, at p. 374). 181 Letter from Nelson to Otto in Schiitte, op. cit. 126 f, at p. 127. 182 Bousset himself prepared a new edition of Fries' philosophical novel, Julius und Evagoras.

CHAPMAN 'great bowls of the golden fruit'185 of epistemological security in the face of the massive threats posed by the modern world, his importance had been tragically overlooked.186 Thus Otto mused: 'Perhaps, if the choice had fallen on him [as Berlin Professor instead of Hegel], there would have been a Friesian instead of a Hegelian period. For the location, influence and circumstances contributed a great deal to spread that School's influence.'187 Otto was at one with Troeltsch in delineating the distinctiveness of the phenomenon of religion, but was not content to remain merely with the realm of appearances since for 'the religious person, this is no matter of indifference'.188 Religion seemed to require an epistemology which allowed for direct access to things in-themselves. According to Otto, it was Fries' 'improvement' to Kant's philosophy that allowed for this direct apprehension.188 This was seen as the true inheritance of the Kantian tradition, and thus, according to Bousset, Fries was 'one of the most faithful pupils of Kant throughout his life; and however much he altered and developed him, he did all this in the spirit of Kantian criticism'.180 For Fries, the world of appearances which was determined by the spatio-temporal form of apprehension, would 'gradually dwindle into nothing' leaving the 'realm of spirit and of free dom'.181 Rather than being mere forms of possible experience, as they were for Kant, the a prioris became objects of a possible cognition (Erkenntnis) founded on reason's self confidence, and which no scepticism could shake.192 Reason was thus conferred with its own form of knowledge which rested on 'obscure and deep feelings of truth'.193 Behind the world of appearances the human being was granted access to an 'imperishable understand ing of the essence of things'.194 Thus, for Fries, the religious a priori was 'the same a priori with which we guarantee the reality of a tree, of a headache, of certainty and of God'.195 Such percep 185 Ibid, p. xviii. 186 Ibid, p. xi. 187 JFR, p. 41/ET p. 26.

And if he knows further what mist is, and how this affects his vision, so he also cognises the fact of his limitations and can escape these limitations when he can imagine what traits are absent from the perfect knowledge (viz. greyness and haziness) even if he cannot himself positively supply the additions.196 Bousset could thus affirm that 'in the spiritual possession of this higher idea of reason we have the courage to speak of this whole world of nature: you are only an appearance of a deeper reality'. In short, he goes on, 'there is no more powerful a weapon against the a priori of naturalism'.197 This misty access to the realm of things-in-themselves overcame the Third Antinomy as a fact 'known of Reason' yet 'incapable of proof',198 where the spatio-temporal world was transcended.199 This form of knowledge (cognoscere)200 had absolutely nothing in common with knowledge (scientia) limited by space and time, but was rather conferred by "'pure apperception'", by the I-con sciousness which guarantees the spiritual substance as distinct from the material'.201 It was a 'sentiment and obscure conception' or Ahndung,202 a mode of knowledge guaranteed by feeling (Gefiihl), a 'cognizance in an unconceptional [sic] or preconcep tional [m'c] way . . . apart from sensual or conceptual cognizances' and thus a mode of apprehension quite distinct also from faith (Glaube) which abandons all witnesses of the senses and scientific 198 JFR, p. 128/ET p. 67. 197 Bousset, Foreword to Julius und Evagoras, p. xxv. 198 JFR ρ 132/ET p. 68.

CHAPMAN knowledge (Wissen)',203 Thus, according to Otto: Feeling gives a third manner of cognition alongside knowledge and faith which combines the two and brings them to a unity. Under the power of the dark feelings of the beautiful and the sublime in all its forms in natural and spiritual life we understand immediately the eternal in the temporal and the temporal as an appearance of the eternal.204 The a prioris were no longer mere forms but could be experienced in a manner akin to aesthetic feeling; they were, as it were, 'schem atized' in the secret places of the mind where 'eternal reality broke through the veil of temporality'.205 According to Otto, Fries' philosophy had profound implications for the contemporary tasks of the philosophy of religion. No longer was it to be conceived as a supernatural form of physics conferring proofs for theological knowledge in a manner equivalent to that of the natural sciences, but rather it was a science of the out workings of the eternal in the temporal as they were dimly per ceived in the cognition of feeling.206 There was thus an immediate perception of the unity of all things which created 'a feeling of peculiar satisfaction' of the unity of the human being and God.207 In Fries, all that was lacking was an adequate application of philosophy to historical religion, which manifested itself in a vari ety of forms as different from one another as the 'human being is from the tortoise',208 yet, as de Wette brilliantly showed, he never theless provided the resources for such an application. How and where the highest forms of religion express themselves was deter mined by the 'free judging power of feeling', which in turn was 'only possible after the philosophy of religion has provided the basis and the guiding threads for the whole undertaking'.209 Fries' philosophy provides the basis for Otto's later influential work, Das Heilige, and for his comparative studies of religion. Throughout his career, the essence of religion continued to be 203 Otto remarks that Ahnung is 'not so much "man's deepest longing and need" as a Gefuhl ...

The double-sided character of reality to which Kant gave expression in the Third Antinomy is overcome in the experienced unity of all that exists in the knowledge guaran teed by dark feeling or Ahnung. XI. The a priori and the Historical Method. WlLHELM BoUSSET's RESPONSE TO TrOELTSCH Wilhelm Bousset, in his attempt to answer the question of 'how, in the midst of a comparative and all-embracing conception of history, norms and a normative conception of reality could be found',213 developed ideas that had been merely hinted at by Otto: We are once again searching for the 'religious a priori' from all directions. Supernaturalism and the historical method (Historismus) refuse to 210 Cf. Gottheit und Gottheiten der Arier (GieBen, 1932), 4: 'religion is that disposition of the mind characterised through feelings of a peculiar sort, which have analogies to feelings in other arenas and continually combined with them in many ways, but which are nevertheless qualitatively different and cannot be derived from the others.' 211 The Idea of the Holy, 187. The picture of Christ presented in The Kingdom of God and the Son of Man (trans. Floyd V. Filson and Bertram Lee-Wolf (London, 19432)) is similarly dominated by the 'numinous nimbus' (p. 164) which surrounds the historical figure. This marks the inbreaking of the eschatological realm into the present, the subsequent ecclesiastical allegorizations of which are mere trivial izations (p. 375 f.). It is interesting to note that the picture of Christ in Life and Ministry of Jesus of 1902 was already imbued with 'the faculty of divination of particularly gifted natures' (p. 33). The heroic qualities of Christ in the earlier work (p. 84) are transformed into the charismatic and numinous qualities in the latter. The continuity of purpose is emphasized by Philip C. Almond, 'Rudolf Otto and the Kantian tradition' in N.Z.S.Th.Rph. 25 (1983), esp. pp. 52-5. Otto expressed his continuing commitment to Friesianism in 1923 in a conversation with R. F. Davidson (op. cit., 134 η. 2). Soren Holm, however, (in 'Apriori und Urphanomen bei Rudolf Otto' in Benz, op. cit. 70-83) emphasizes the discontinu ity between the conceptions of the a priori in JFR and Das Heilige. 212 Cf. Troeltsch's review of Das Heilige, 'Zur Religionsphilosophie' in KS 23 (1918), 75: 'Otto confirms my thesis that modern philosophy of religion and theology stand much closer in their scientific thought to spirituality than to objective theology, the Word and authority of Luther or the natural religion of the Enlightenment.' 213 'Anwendung', 429.</page><page sequence="31">500 MARK D. CHAPMAN renounce a criterion and a principle for truth in religion. History of religion becomes a Leviathan. But how will it succeed in moving from a mere description of religions to being a science of religion, if it is nothing other than a history of religion? . . . Indeed, how can it even be a history of religion unless it already possesses a principle, even if only dimly seen, according to which one selects, not to say classifies, the historical subject matter?214 For Bousset, the historical sciences, which treated the history of religion in the same manner as any other phenomenon, thrust theology into a great dilemma: on the one hand, the acceptance of a thoroughgoing historical method 'liberated more and more from special Christian presuppositions' by such scholars as Wrede and Wellhausen had created a 'feeling of insecurity' which, when taken to its extreme by materialists like Kautsky and monists like Arthur Drews, could lead to a 'denial of the historicity of Jesus and the dissolution of Christianity into a complex of historical religious connections'. On the other hand, however, the practical systematic 'theology of mediation' of the Ritschlian School had 'in principle denied an adequate scientific knowledge in matters of religion and Christianity and replaced it with a practical religious value-judgement'.215 Bousset sought a way out of this dilemma which would 'free us from the consequences of a strong conservatism and respect for the products of history on the one side, and the tired scepticism where everything is dissolved in relativism on the other'.216 Neither Herrmann's evasion of history nor Troeltsch's historicism offered satisfactory answers; instead Bousset sought a third posi tion which offered a 'universal a priori element'217 as 'a secure foundation against modern empiricism and evolutionism'.218 Bousset viewed Troeltsch, with his teleological historical philo sophy of religion which allowed only for approximations to the truth but never for a full perception of the truth, as unable to provide that sense of epistemological security demanded by the absolute claims of religion,219 and thus demanded a return to 'universally rational elements in what we call religion' with the same epistemological status as the principle of causality in the 214 JFR, p. 32/ET p. 17. 215 'Anwendung', 427 f.

A historical a priori could only ever lead to 'historicism (Histori zismus) and empirical psychologism'.228 Thus Bousset asserts: To answer the question of the a priori of religion in human spiritual life is at the same time a justification of religion; and with all this we find ourselves in the arena of pure philosophical investigation, whereby all pure empirical-historical elements must ultimately be excluded.229 The possibility of a direct access to a reality beyond 'everything historical and everything individual' offered a 'storm-free arena' which would overcome the uncertainties of Troeltsch's theology, 220 Ibid. 432 f. 221 222 223 224 225 226 227 Foreword to Julius und Evagoras, p. xxv.

CHAPMAN which 'has not completed the return to Kant's rational method strongly enough and which has exchanged the rationalism of Kant for strong historical-empirical elements'.230 Thus Bousset offered a very different view of Kant's contribution to theology: instead of locating the religious a priori as the goal to which history was proceeding as it gradually conformed more and more to its rational core and which served to limit all human attempts to realize absolute religion, Bousset dislocated the a priori from this eschato logical basis. He saw the a priori of religion not as the goal, but as the unification of the future with the present in the atemporal realm of direct apprehension of the thing-in-itself. Thus, although Bousset agreed with Troeltsch that the historical could never embody the rational, he removed the teleological basis of this statement and devalued the historical as a necessary factor in any religion. Bousset instead created a 'storm free arena' for direct apprehension of absolute truth.231 This direct apprehension of the absolute was not to be equated with the pathological response of mysticism whereby the indi vidual was granted a direct knowledge of God.232 Rather, a myster ious unity felt within ourselves, and not any mystical unity within the spatio-temporal world, led to the moment of religious certi tude. Fries' philosophy thus provided the 'deepest foundation for reality by directing us with all our questions to ourselves and to research the laws of our spiritual being. It teaches: look to yourself and nowhere else where you will find the fundament of your being'.233 Thus 'the miraculous in the deeper sense of the word, the miracle of the individual spiritual life, still exists for us',234 and the depths of the individual human soul became the very heart of 'the Gospel [which] proclaims [a] God who in the first instance seeks and desires the individual human soul'.235 In short, Bousset concluded: These researches lead man to the depths of his own being and demand this of him: affirm the depths of your own life.236 In a lecture on the meaning of the historical Jesus for faith, Bousset applied his Friesian method to Christology, where he 230 Ibid. 436. 231 Ibid. 232 Thus 'against the turbulent character of Anglo-American Christianity', Bousset asserts that he holds fast to 'Ritschl's battle against all mysticism . . . which is a task taken over by Herrmann, and which, indeed, is his greatest service to religion' (ibid. 487) 233 Foreword to Julius und Evagoras, p. xx. 234 Bousset, What is Religion?, trans F.

Thus: if science were to pronounce the most extreme verdict that Jesus had not existed, faith cannot be lost as it touches us with its eternal basis; the Gospel picture of Jesus nevertheless remains, even though it is merely great poetry, the poetry of eternally symbolic meaning.239 The Jesus of history became the 'highest symbol of an eternal world'240 but could never be equated with that world. 'Does not Jesus thus seem greater than the greatest of the prophets', Bousset asked, 'because in him the quiet rational element was stronger than in them'?241 In short, 'the great religious personality does not only create symbols of faith, but himself becomes a symbol for the community of faith'.242 Under the power of such symbols the 'inconceivable' naked truths of reason were clothed with temporal symbols. Thus just as the concept of causality was used for millen nia before it was ever conceptualized, so in religion the religious a priori was for a long time hidden beneath primitive symbolic forms. The symbol made the rational kernel live, it 'gives the skeleton flesh and blood', but it could never fully reveal this kernel which could be known only in the immediacy of feeling in the cognition of Ahnung.2i3 XII. The Clash Between Fries and Kant Even though he claimed to be 'not remotely personally hurt',244 Troeltsch was disappointed by Bousset's criticisms and felt they ought to have discussed the matter together beforehand.

CHAPMAN ished investigations',245 Troeltsch defended the rational character of his system in response to Bousset's charge of historicism and asserted that 'however anti-intellectual the decision is, it is no act of chance or mere taste; rather it introduces the feeling of objective necessity into all subjectivity'.246 Ultimately, however, Troeltsch could not agree with Bousset: Ί cannot leave history as I cannot find the courage to affirm decisively a dim rationalism. I've obviously thought further about this matter but without being compelled to give up my interest in history and psychology.'247 Although recognizing that Bousset's rationalism moved beyond the vagaries of history and 'is quite exciting', he remarked, 'along with this the Christianness of reli gion is lost'.248 It was nothing more than passing chance that rational truths are united with the person of Jesus, and thus the difficulties of historical research into this object are allowed to fall . . . this is nothing more than the crystallisation of a religion of reason out of traditional Christianity, and the loss of all media, piety, cult, imagination and feeling for the concrete and historical ... If one does not feed a religion of reason with impressions from concrete life and banishes it to the universally valid, one ends up with a formalism, and one gets universal laws in place of a living Godhead. That, however, is an inversion of actual religion.249 In a candid word Troeltsch then confirmed that he had not suc ceeded in clearly uniting the streams of the historical and the rational and instead tended strongly towards an anti-rationalistic affirmation of life, with which the rationalistic currents of my thought can only be united with the greatest difficulty. I have up till now held back from this position. I believe I can no longer achieve a philosophical or theological theory which will solve the difficulties of the situation.250 Although he may not have been able to offer any neat alternative to Bousset's Friesianism, Troeltsch at least recognized that Bous set failed to do justice to the historical vitalities of the Christian religion. Bousset's 'storm-free' solution to the problems of faith and history provoked bitter reaction from other theologians.

Probably the most vitriolic debate ever to have occupied the pages of the Z.Th.K. was that provoked by Bousset's review of Otto in the Theologischer Rundschau. It was initiated by Karl Bornhausen (1882-1940)251 who criticized Otto and Bousset for their attempts to repristinate Fries. 'Our culture', he remarked, 'is too bland for heroes.'252 Despite its claims to be returning to a corrected form of Kantian ism, Otto's system was a form of empiricism which destroyed the purity of Kant's reason,253 the Friesian position no longer de serving the name of Kantianism, since 'if one correctly grasps the Kantian a priori position, so the worthlessness of such a world of being for human reason is made apparent'.254 In another discussion article of the same year Bornhausen compared Troeltsch and Otto, remarking that 'for Troeltsch the noumenal is still other, whereas for Otto it has become identified with the natural character of things'.255 Although 'Otto might appear to have created the unity of the a priori he had in fact destroyed religion by giving it purely psychological founda tions'.256 Thus the transcendental question 'is a question as to the form of knowledge—how is it possible? The psychological [or in Friesian terms, the anthropological] question is a question as to the content of knowledge—of what does it consist?'257 This was a grave confusion of Kantianism: the importance of the Kantian categories rested not in the realm of things-in-themselves, but in the limitations they gave to human thought. The idea that they could be grounded psychologically was quite anathema to Kant, and in reality was 'a naïve repetition of the realism of the empiri cists which lessened none of their errors'.258 Otto's attempt to get behind the Idea to a misty perception of the thing-in-itself 'smashed Idealism in the face'.259 251 On Bornhausen, see esp. Manfred Marquardt, 'Karl Bornhausen' in Vergessene Theologen des 20. Jahrhunderts; Studien zur Theologiegeschichte, eds.

The pure psychological and anthropological has little or nothing to do with the Kantian doctrine of the critical a priori, that is, to inner necessity and</page><page sequence="37">506 MARK D. CHAPMAN Bornhausen's greatest criticism, however, was reserved for Bousset's separation of reason from history which would, he claimed, mean that religion would 'lose contact with ethics'.260 A religion located purely in the individual's soul seemed to lose contact with the historical world and thus with ethical activity. Indeed, in a provocative statement, Bornhausen went as far as accusing Bousset of mysticism, since cognition divorced from any interest in the historical realm 'would hover in the air'.261 In short, he maintained, 'the human being is not given psychologically but is revealed historically'.262 Instead of this vague feeling of psycho logical security, Bornhausen searched for a stream which flows from the divine, which alone could ground ethical behaviour and give shape to history,263 thus asserting that the speculative tasks of religion at present are without doubt in the cautious development of the philosophy of history . . . The rational character of religion is not to be clarified psychologically but rather psychology and history are to be evaluated epistemologically on the basis of the Kantian a priori: this is the contemporary task for a systematic theology which makes use of philosophy.264 In short: Psychologism, neo-Friesianism comes too late; time has moved on. The next great decisive battle for philosophy and religion will be fought on the ground of the philosophy of history.265 Bousset's reply to Bornhausen,266 which must count as one of the most libellous articles ever to have been published in a theolo gical journal, began by accusing him of a failure to read Fries and of 'massive polemics rather than a concerted attempt to understand the opponent'.267 Attempting to show that he had a far greater understanding of the primary sources, Bousset built up a complic ated argument around a misunderstood possessive pronoun which, whatever its justification, did little to counter Bornhausen's case.268 All that Bousset was prepared to concede was that the psycholo validity' ('Zur Religionsphilosophie', 70). Such a philosophy might mean that the 'labyrinth of metaphysics' could be avoided but was essentially 'the formal eleva tion of the philosophy of religion and the theology of rationalism' (ibid. 74). 26o 'Wide,· den Neofriesianismus', 387. 281 Ibid. 397. 262 'Das religiose Apriori', 204. 263 'Wider den Neofriesianismus', 404 f. 264 'Das religiose Apriori', 205. 265 'Wider den Neofriesianismus', 405. 266 Wilhelm Bousset, 'In Sachen des Neofriesianismus.

Thus Bousset concluded: It is very seldom that I have come across such a critical writing as Bornhausen's 'Wider den Neofriesianismus' which has done so little justice to its opponent, and which swarms with such numerous and basic misunderstandings, especially when the conditions for understanding had been so clearly given by like-minded researches. Bornhausen's ability to study strange currents of thought, which he has already proved elsewhere, allows us to hope that he might make good the blunders of his polemic, which might then give us the opportunity for a discussion which might really further the debate.269 The editors of the Z.Th.K. gave Bornhausen, who was evidently deeply hurt by the assault from the senior figure, the opportunity to respond to Bousset's accusations: Professor Bousset has personally borne out his heart and soul in the defence of neo-Friesianism given here. Only seldom in the course of his discussion does he lose sight of my lesser person.270 He cannot comprehend the personal offence taken by Bousset: his article was intended as one of a series which entered into construct ive debate with another thinker. Bousset, who intended to bring the matter to a close, had admittedly succeeded, but only by default, since there was now no possibility that the constructive debate could continue. With an air of pathos, Bornhausen once again entered into discussion with Bousset but asked, 'Have we chosen the best place for a battle?' He again criticized the psychological method: Whoever searches for pure a priori knowledge with a psychological or anthropological beginning; whoever believes he can . . . thus possess the 'true being of things', the things-in-themselves, sees nothing more than spectres by the clear light of day. He has failed to understand Kant and does not have the right to dress himself up with this name.271 Fries' words might be very close to Kant, but 'his thoughts are very distant'272 and he was far closer to English empiricism than to Kant himself. Bornhausen continued by asserting the need to return to a genuine Kantianism, to the 'simplicity and security' of Kantian cognition by which alone the freedom of the living spirit can be won; to make the self-consciousness of man, with his creative strivings for knowledge, the basis of our culture 269 Ibid. 159. 270 Karl Bornhausen, 'In Sachen des Neofriesianismus.

Thus I had the duty to begin with the Kantian critical concept of knowledge in my attack on Fries and thus I have the right also to finish with it.273 The importance of Kant rested in his critical method which defined human limitations but also allowed for a continual criti cism of the past and thus a progress to a better understanding of the rational basis of all things. Bousset's 'storm free arena', with its immediate cognition of such a rational basis, robbed humanity of the chance of this albeit stormy progress. Thus Bornhausen concluded: 'Begone with this idle talk of orthodoxy and dogmatics.' Was Galileo orthodox when he saw that the earth went around the sun? And just as the earth orbits the sun, so the world of appearances revolves around human reason. In this pithy innocence and greatness the law of Kantian critical knowledge stands before us. To make this in future into the common possession of mankind is the task which neo-Friesianism has not been able to obscure.274 There are few debates in theological journals which provoke a written apology from the editors; however, Wilhelm Herrmann and Martin Rade felt compelled to respond to Bousset's vitriol. They were critical, not of neo-Friesianism per se, but of the sort of neo-Friesianism which accused Bornhausen of ignorance and misunderstanding. Thus they state: 'Whoever "methodically" misunderstands will not be able to dismiss the charge of not being scientific for very long.'275 They then went on to suggest that perhaps the philosophical press was the best place for debate on the relative merits of Kant and Fries and with this the discussion was brought to a close. XIII. Conclusion The use of Kant in German theology in the first two decades of the present century reveals much about the issues at stake in contemporary religion. First, it is clear that under the threat of naturalism and materialism theology was forced to respond. Kant's philosophy, with its abundance of possible theological applica tions, was a natural apologetic resource. Second, however, it is also clear that Kant could provide the weaponry for the most diverse dogmatic interpretations of Christianity. Kantianism was used not merely to defend religion, but also, by those who followed 273 Ibid. t65. 274 Ibid. 275 'In Sachen des Neofriesianismus. III. Nachwort der Redaktion' in Z.Th.K. 2i (1911), 165 f., at p. 165.</page><page sequence="40">APOLOGETICS AND THE RELIGIOUS A PRIORI 509 Herrmann, to isolate it from science, and thus to relegate it to apologetic impotence. Finally, even amongst those who borrowed Kant's terminology for the defence of religion against naturalism there was dogmatic conflict: a modified form of Kantianism even suggested to some, notably Bousset, the possibility of an escape from historical relativism. In the history of theology since the First World War, the iso lationist strand has been most often dominant. Theology was isolated from a history identified with the meaningless slaughter of the fields of Flanders; it was consequently robbed of apologetic potential, except perhaps as a silent witness to the frailty of all human constructs. All theology was destined to be dogmatics. It offered no hope for a reform of the present since all history was equally doomed to death and corruption. Although such a theology may have had its place as an alternative to the massive evils of the 1930s, the legacy of the 'anti-historicist revolution'276 was to create a more real reality of an eternal now which had little connection with secular reality.277 Such eternity seemed to have little to say about ethical activity in the present. There is a sense too in which Bousset's direct perception of eternity survived (albeit divested of its Friesian overtones) in Bultmann's accounts of authentic existence.278 His project of demythologization can perhaps best be seen as another attempt to grasp the rational kernel behind the historical form. The direct confrontation with 'the word' seems at least the dynamic equiva lent of Ahnung. Again this seems to result in an evasion of history and consequently of ethics, and ultimately, a denial of human responsibility. Troeltsch's teleological religious a priori, which appeared to many to be closely 'bound up with the destiny of an epoch'279 long since past, seems, however, admittedly under various new dis guises, and most often unwittingly, to have returned to the centre stage of theology. His combination of realism and optimism, where there can be no easy solutions within history, no immediate per ception of absolute truth, but where nevertheless there is always the hope that history might be moving to its goal, perhaps better 276 Cf. Kurt Nowak, 'Die »antihistoristische Revolution«.

CHAPMAN reflects the continued need, not to escape or to evade, but to transform history, to discipline it ethically. For Troeltsch, it is the dare to accept the meaningfulness of history that ultimately provides the justification for religion. Human life is not to be denied in a deeper life of faith, but is given hope as the goal of history, the 'religious a priori', empowers the human being to shape a future which will gradually resemble a picture of reality viewed sub specie aeternitatis. Such hope, however, does not usurp the realism that recognizes that no present construct, however sacred and however profound, can ever be completely identified with the absolute: the absolute is with God, all human truth is relative. All we can have is approximation.280 A theology which combines realism and hope can fill the present with purpose, even if the full content of that purpose is forever hidden in an unrealisable future. There is a sense, then, in which the religious a priori might be said to be alive and well in theologies of hope and it is perhaps also possible that Kant's epistemology provides a more realistic orientation for a contemporary hope than a utopianism which devalues the present for the sake of revolution ary change. Indeed it might almost be true to say that the philo sopher of Kdnigsberg offers a Fabian alternative to revolutionary praxis, but a more credible and realistic alternative which will perhaps more effectively liberate people in the present from an idolatrous trust in false absolutes.
