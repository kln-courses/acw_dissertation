<plain_text><page sequence="1">DAVID A. GOLDBLATT Do Works of Art Have Rights? I THIS PAPER will cover a range of issues that have arisen in the course of considering Alan Tormey's provocative paper "Aesthetic Rights." 1 Tormey holds that "art works are the bearers of a special class of rights; that art works have, in virtue of their status as art works, certain determinable entitle- ments to be dealt with, or not to be dealt with in certain ways." I shall be primarily concerned with showing the kinds of diffi- culties that one,encounters in the course of the investigation of the problem, "Do works of art have rights?" The issue of whether or not works of art have rights is logically distinct from the issue of whether or not there are aesthetic rights. For even if it were true that works of art had rights, it does not follow from that that they have aesthetic rights. Per- haps a case can be made that they have legal rights, historical rights and/or so forth. And, even if it were shown that works of art do not have rights at all, some other entities might still have aesthetic rights, for example, a certain class of peo- ple. Of course if works of art do not have rights, then they do not have aesthetic rights. Tormey answers, "Yes" to the ques- tion, "Do works of art have rights?" by attempting to show that works of art have aesthetic rights. He is interested in finding out if works of art have rights as works of art. DAVID A. GOLDBLATT is associate professor of phil- osophy at Denison University. Recognizing that art works are insensate entities, Tormey argues that art works have rights by virtue of their having obligation- generating interests. He argues that "Where the rights of X entail corresponding obliga- tions for Y, X need not be a rational being, but Y must be." What needs to be done, according to Tormey, is to establish that works of art really do impose obliga- tions upon rational beings. He says, "I shall therefore assume that, if it can be shown of some entity, X, that it is the possessor of interests that are genuinely obligation-generating . . . then we have every reason to speak of that entity as hav- ing corresponding rights." When Tormey speaks of obligation-generating interests he means, in this context, interests that entitle its possessor "to be treated in certain pre- scriptible ways by obligation bearers." Tormey thinks that to accomplish this he needs to introduce the concept of aesthetic pain. Aesthetic pain, as Tormey uses it, is never the result of our reaction to a bad painting, trite novel, or dull symphony. Aesthetic pain is exemplified in the case of "hearing a violinist play the Debussy Sonata for Violin and Piano with a strident tone or faulty intonation." While each of the above "would normally evoke in the per- ceptive experient some form of avoidance behavior," only of the Debussy case can it be said that "what is responsible for the aesthetic painfulness of the experience is the recognition of incongruity between per- formance and work." When an art work is treated so as "to mar, mask or distort its</page><page sequence="2">70 aesthetic merits," aesthetic pain is normally the result. As it turns out, it is really "the recogni- tion that violence or injustice has been done to an art work" that is the important feature for the establishment of aesthetic rights. For here, Tormey wants to claim, is the recognition that something other than that some person is violated, marred, de- based or affronted and since this furnishes excellent presumptive evidence that we commonly regard them as invested with in- terests that are obligation-generating, there is no reason to deny that they have rights. There are other points that need mention- ing in the course of considering Tormey's position if we are to understand what it is that Tormey is about and if Tormey him- self knows what it is that he is doing. Tormey believes that he is not involved in any normative enterprise, that he is not recommending that works of art ought to have rights but rather claiming that they do have rights. He says, "I will not be argu- ing that we should grant rights of a special sort to art works, but rather that certain aspects of our aesthetic experience, under one possible set of descriptions, suggest that we do in fact regard art works as invested with rights of a kind analogous to those we normally concede to persons." Tormey, apparently, would like to rest his case on the establishment of de facto rights for art works, while ignoring the issue of art works and justified rights.2 That is, Tormey wants to avoid the issue of whether or not works of art ought to have rights, whether their status as rights bearers is legitimate. I want to say, that given the framework of Tormey's argument, Tormey must take exactly the position he says he is not taking whether or not he actually holds the position he says he does. If he is committed to support the view that a certain entity or kind of entity is the bearer of a justified right then it matters not at all whether or not it has that right in a de facto sense. One way of seeing this is to examine Tormey's grounds for holding that an en- tity has rights in the first place, namely its function as obligation-generator. He speaks GOLDBLATT of genuine obligations and says, "If rights are construed, roughly, as entitlements, they may be thought of not only as entailing interests on the part of the claimant or possessor but also, in the standard case, obligations on the part of those-necessarily rational-beings from whom a respect for those interests can legitimately be required or expected." (My emphasis.) I do not want here to decide whether or not it is useful to distinguish between obli- gations that are de facto but also not justi- fied and those that are either de facto and justified or justified alone. It seems reason- able to hold the view that obligations that have only a de facto element are merely pseudo-obligations; not real obligations at all. However, I want to say only that obli- gations that have a justified element are the only obligations of which it can be said that if one has those obligations then, at least prima facie, those obligations ought to be fulfilled. If then I claim that such and such is an obligation, I am also committing myself minimally to the view that that obligation should be fulfilled, all other things being equal. But, if I am basing my ascription of rights on the sufficiency of obligations, and if the recognition that an entity is an obligation-generator involves me in a nor- mative enterprise, then the ascription of rights via the establishment of correspond- ing obligations commits me to a normative enterprise as well. On Tormey's view of what it is to have a right, the establishment of de facto rights does not enter the picture. For if the de facto situation changed, so that rational beings began to disrespect the rights of a given entity, the obligation to respect the interests of that entity would not change when the de facto element was no longer present. If all that Tormey cared to do was to establish that there were de facto rights for works of art, it would be irrelevant to appeal to the obligations that he thinks we have toward works of art; In fact, it is usually the case that in times of social conflict, when the de facto rights of individuals begin to disappear, that the appeal to rights as a valid moral claim in</page><page sequence="3">Do Works of Art Have Rights? the face of perhaps incurable injustice be- comes most conspicuous. II I will now consider a matter of general significance in understanding Tormey's posi- tion. I will discuss a contention that, if true, would have the force of a reductio ad absurdum argument against the claim that "art works are the bearers of a special class of rights." The argument is not, strictly speaking, a reductio ad absurdum, for a formal contradiction will not result; but there is something like a contradiction, i.e., an unacceptable consequence. Consider this: If works of art have rights according to Tormey's argument, then by virtue of that argument, parking meters, money, medicine, autographs of famous people (indeed anyone), sidewalks, clocks, and a virtual army of other non-art artifacts have rights as well. It could be said of them, indeed must be said of them, that they are also the bearers of a special class of rights. Since we would not want to attribute rights to these other artifacts there must be some- thing wrong with the argument that attrib- utes rights to art works.3 To do this I will briefly characterize the relevant elements in Tormey's case, a char- acterization which will aid in clarifying Tormey's case as well as the argument against it. Now in devising the comparison between art works and other artifacts it should be noted that it is not the task to show that we have obligations to non-art artifacts but only that it makes about as much sense to say we have an obligation to most artifacts as it does to say we have an obligation to art works, even if it makes little or no sense to say either. What we have under Tormey's analysis is a certain entity, E, a certain set of pre- scriptions, P, and the class of rational be- ings, R, for whom P is the content of their obligation to E. In addition, it will be use- ful to designate the class R,, a sub-class of the class of rational beings, for it is this class that is the recipient of aesthetic pain. There are at least three interesting things one can mean when one says that works of 71 art as works of art ought "to be treated in certain prescriptible ways by obligation bearers," and I will call them P1, P2, and P3 for future reference. P1 is the set of prescriptions by which one responds to a work of art in order to understand, appreciate, or interpret the work of art. It is not the case that there is necessarily a single way of understanding, appreciating, or interpreting works of art. And it may even be the case, as some hold, that there are equally legitimate contradic- tory assertions about works of art. However it is not the case that any way of under- standing, appreciating, or interpreting works of art will do; that there are ways in which one can violate every legitimate set of P1.4 P2 is the set of prescriptions that are per- tinent to the proper performing or present- ing of a work of art, such that, to use an example from Tormey, an "awkward" per- formance of the ballet Giselle, resulting in an incongruity between work and per- formance, would be a violation of P2. P3 is the set of prescriptions that is perti- nent to the physical mistreatment of a work of art as a work of art, that is, in such a way as to interfere with its aesthetic value. Throwing paint on a Mondrian or burning a Rauschenberg are examples of violations of P3. While an R's acting in accordance with some P1 is a necessary condition for aesthetic- pain consequences for R, only the violation of some P2 or P3 can result in aesthetic pain. It would seem then that only a viola- tion of a member of P2 or P3 can result in a breach of obligation toward a work of art. At least this is what Tormey wants to say. It ought to be noted, too, that relevant violation can result merely by breaching a member of P2 or P3 but not necessarily by breaching a member from each set. This is important at this point because for non- art artifacts it is most obviously the viola- tion of P3 that is contextually relevant. In fact Tormey recognizes that paintings, in- deed, all visual as opposed to performing arts, are not paradigmatically violated with respect to some P2 and therefore are not a source of aesthetic pain, as a result of a P2</page><page sequence="4">72 violation.5 Therefore P3 is needed, he feels, if aesthetic pain is to be comfortably applied to all the arts and not just the performing arts. How do we characterize the class R8? R, will consist of those beings who have a cer- tain appreciation for E. We can say that such beings value E, understand something about the nature of E, perhaps the way E ought to be treated if it is to retain those of its properties that are valued, and that the members of R, are sensitive to the abuse, mistreatment, marring, and destruc- tion of E, in such a way that they normally exhibit some form of avoidance behavior when this sort of incongruity occurs be- tween this negative treatment of E and the way E ought to be treated. Tormey, as was noted earlier, calls this class, at least with re- spect to art works, the perceptive experients. A point about R, might be of interest here. The size of R8, i.e., the number of members of which R8 consists, is irrelevant to Tormey's case. For example, we might imagine an R, whose constituency was very low, perhaps even only one or an R, that is presently a null set but was at one time not null. We might imagine for example an extremely esoteric form of electronic music, of which it can be said that at time t1, the class of perceptive experients con- sists of only two, a husband and wife team of composers, who have died at t2, but that at t3, some twenty years later R, consists of thousands of young enthusiasts. Which class then, is the class of obligation- bearers, R or RS? We will recall that Tormey tells us that obligation-bearers are "those - necessarily rational - beings from whom a respect can legitimately be required or ex- pected." Now it seems clear enough that the choice must be in favor of the larger class R. Indeed it is the class of those not a member of any R, upon whom these obligations even may need to be imposed, for it would seem that members of that sub-class of R are more likely to violate P2 or P3 than members of some R,. To the extent that there is an analogy here with human rights and obligations, that is like saying that it is not only those sensitive to GOLDB LATT the breachings of moral prescriptions that bear obligations to humans, but rather all persons are obligation-bearers, especially those who are insensitive to such breachings. What needs to be illustrated next is that Tormey has made a pulrported case for the attribution of rights to every valued arti- fact, not just works of art. And at one point in his paper, while ending his discussion of aesthetic pain, he says, "It is a commonly painful experience to observe the distortion or the debasing of any valued object . . ." Let us go through an imaginative exercise to see that this is so. Take the case of con- tact lenses. Contact lenses are objects of value. Analogous to the class R8 is the class R8,, the class of those who are apprecia- tive of the value of contact lenses and in- cludes among others, optometrists, contact lens wearers, and their friends and mothers. There are certain ways that one ought to treat contact lenses as contact lenses, e.g., soak them regularly, and certain ways in which one ought not treat them, e.g., scratch them. Thus we have for contact lenses a set of prescriptions, analogous to P3, which we can call P3,. Violations of P3, will result in some kind of avoidance be- havior for the class R,g. The uncomfortable result for members of Ri, we can call, analo- gous to aesthetic pain, optometric pain. The set of prescriptions one ought to follow to avoid optometric pain is also the content of the ways in which one can fulfill one's obligations to contact lenses (if one has such obligations) as well as the list of entitlements (if entitlements they be) that contact lenses have. Contact lenses, then, generate obligations upon the class R and corresponding to those obligations are a set of rights which we can call optometric rights. What we can argue for contact lenses we can argue in a similar way for a great num- ber of kinds of artifacts, or a great number of particular artifacts. And we will recall that we need not have more than one mem- ber of an R, in order to complete the analogy. This allows us to include objects that would ordinarily come under the head- ings of sentimental objects or personal</page><page sequence="5">Do Works of Art Have Rights? souvenirs: snapshots, letters, trophies, locks of hair, valentines, etc. as well as objects more generally valued. Thus it would seem that the case of rights for works of art, if a good case, has conse- quences well beyond the class of art objects. If we accept Tormey's case, then it is appro- priate to ascribe rights to most any artifact including works of art. It seems to me that we ought to reject such ascription, that when I look around me at a host of familiar objects, my stereo speakers, my rocking chair, my books, records, table, lamps, and so forth that those are not objects that have rights in a de facto sense nor are they ob- jects that ought to have rights. Nor am I sure what it would be like to have obliga- tions toward them. It would seem, there- fore, that the case has not been made for the claim that works of art have or ought to have rights of any kind, in particular aesthetic rights. I have not said that a special case, under special conceivable circumstances, might not be made for works of art to have rights, only that it has not been made by Tormey, for the cultural milieu, however amorphous, we can be said to share. However, the acceptability of the reductio tells us only that something is wrong, not what has gone wrong or why, and that must be the next task. In doing so I will focus attention upon points relevant in exploring the disanalogy between human rights and aesthetic rights for art works, which is a crucial consideration for Tormey's case. III It is always prima facie justified to at- tempt to interfere with or retard the viola- tion of the rights of persons. That is not true with respect to aesthetic rights, espe- cially where P2 is being violated. Consider Tormey's example of the awkward ballerina. My inference to prevent a violation of the rights of Giselle would, in most circum- stances, be rude and insensitive, not some- thing that is justified in most respects. In- deed, my encouragement of an amateur or 73 grade school production of a significant play, while sometimes a bad idea, is rarely, if ever, a breach of obligation and certainly never a breach of obligation to that play. It will be performed again under better circumstances. What is needed here is em- pathetic understanding, not justice. When we talk about someone having rights we mean among other things that that person is in the right, or at least not in the wrong, or potentially in thle right with respect to a certain standard in a certain circumstance. With respect to human rights, in cases where the exercise or manifestation of those rights are threatened or interfered with, that person is always in the right with respect to a certain standard. So that if I have a right to express my point of view and if a federal commission interferes with those rights, then unless there is good rea- son to think otherwise, I am in the right in this particular conflict.6 In the case of aesthetic rights it makes no sense to say that works of art are in the right or are not in the right. While it is true that obligations imply ought-statements, ought-statements do not necessarily imply obligations. I ought to wash my dishes as my sink is full and I've got none left, but I am not under an obliga- tion to do so. If I were to imagine special circumstances under which I would have an obligation to wash my dishes (neglected dishes spread diseases and people are com- ing over) my obligation would be a moral one, one to persons, myself, and others, and not to dishes. So while there is no trouble in agreeing with Tormey that works of art ought to be treated in certain ways, there is still room for disagreement about whether I have an obligation to treat them in those ways and especially about whether I have an obligation to them. Tormey grants that interests are not the same as entitlements, that entitlements are interests of a certain sort, interests that generate obligations, and it is as a result of the claim that rational beings have obligations (would we say aesthetic obligations?) to works of art that he says works of art have rights. Thus, the statement, "Rn ought to do X to E " where</page><page sequence="6">74 Ra is a rational being, X an action and E some entity, does not imply that E is en- titled to be treated in those ways, or, corre- spondingly, that Ra is bound to treat E in those ways, nor even the ontologically less risky claim that X is in the interest of E. Tormey's examples of entities that are insensate possessors of interests are not very helpful to his case. He cites nations and companies and to this we could add univer- sities, charities, clubs, and political parties. He also cites examples of a different sort, namely, roles, offices, and professions. But if the purpose of such citation is to draw an analogy between these examples and works of art, then it is important to point out that at its most crucial juncture of comparison the analogy breaks down. For each of the above examples there is an intimate con- nection between it and a sensate being that is not so for works of art. Ontologically, nations, for example, must at least be par- tially analyzed into persons, and some would hold that they can be analyzed entirely in terms of persons.7 Roles, offices, and pro- fessions, at least in paradigm cases, are such that the only candidates for fulfilling them are persons. It is because of their reducibility to or necessary substitution by persons that each of Tormey's examples can be said to be capable of acting. It is not unusual then that we can think of them as agents and therefore as entities that can exercise and violate the rights of others. It is then, not that works of art are akin to companies and nations in that they are insensate beings that is significant, but that they are im- portantly unlike them in that while corpo- rations and nations are capable of action, works of art are not; even when, like Calder's mobiles and Moholy-Nagy's motorized sculpture, they are capable of movement. There is a further rights-relevant differ- ence between the way we treat works of art and the way we treat persons that is difficult to appraise philosophically, and that difference is this: we don't say that works of art have rights, yet we say that persons have rights. "The rights of Beetho- ven's Eroica Symphony were respected last night," "This court finds that the rights of GOLDBLATT Death of a Salesman, had not been vio- lated," are at best locutions that we, as speakers of the English language, do not use. One philosophical motivation for Tor- mey's analysis is what he feels is the ex- planatory power of his contention. He says, ".. . I shall be arguing that there are some irreducible facts about our aesthetic experience and our transactions with art works that can be adequately accounted for only if we recognize that art works are tacitly held to be de facto bearers of certain rights." (My emphasis.) Tormey seems espe- cially interested in the "fact" that we talk about the work as violated and not persons, although he does not feel the need to ex- plain that we do not talk about the rights of the work itself. He says, "It is the work itself that is affronted, distorted, deformed, maligned, insulted, or done violence to- not the artist, the performer, or the public, even though their interests may suffer and their rights also be infringed as a result of the mistreatment of the art work." What is most puzzling about this last contention is that here Tormey has rendered superfluous his introduction of the concept of aesthetic pain. For it seems explanation enough to say that when we talk about the violation of works of art we mean that we are violat- ing the sets P2 or P3, the ways in which works of art are to be treated if they are to retain their aesthetic merit. But if there are obligations and rights they are the obli- gations to and the rights of class R,, those sensitive to aesthetic pain, that are at stake. In short, Tormey has helped to explain why locutions about violating art works are not about violations of rights of art works, but rather elliptical expressions for saying some things about art works and some about per- sons. It seems to me that this is an ex- tremely plausible account, one that does away with the contention that the rights of art works are the only explanation of these facts, the contention which Tormey holds. IV This section will argue that to say that persons have rights is to advocate a proposal</page><page sequence="7">Do Works of Art Have Rights? and that the moving of concepts from one domain of language to another cannot be done by fiat alone. These points are made to show the inadequacy of Tormey's ac- count at particular foci in his argument but there is no pretense here in the space below of having exhaustively solved or even faced the large number of deep philosophi- cal problems lurking in their waters. What I want to say about works of art and rights is that works of art do not have rights. My reason, however, is not because I deny that art works ought to be treated in certain ways. I believe that. It is because the domain of application for our concepts of entitlements, obligations, and rights is (and ought to be) the domain of social be- ings. And with that application comes a set of attitudes, characters, gestalts, expecta- tions, points of view, roles, protocols, and so forth, somewhat akin to those that come along with a certain use of the expression "person." Indeed, it is easy to see how the concept of rights functions in an explana- tory capacity to make and preserve the dis- tinction between things and persons. To apply rights to another conceptual system, namely artifacts, is to give it another mean- ing tantamount to asking for a set of con- ceptual changes that I am not at all sure I am capable of making. One cannot hold, in isolation from our form of life, that works of art have or ought to be granted rights, without also asking for radical transformations in our form of life itself. To assert that persons have rights is not solely to make an empirical discovery. To assert that persons have rights is to advocate an institutional proposal for social justice. It is to endorse a point of view of which rights is one conceptual link in a larger chain of social concepts. To say that works of art have rights is also to advocate a proposal, but one whose actualization is somewhat more problematic to understand. What it would seem to call for is a world in which certain artifacts not only ought to be treated in certain ways but are to be understood roughly as per- sons. And it seems that Tormey has ac- knowledged the necessity of this conceptual switch and does not find it problematic. 75 He says: "Art works, no more than persons, are fully interchangeable entities, and it is their logical similarity with respect to their identity that may account for our treating art works as quasi-persons, and thus, in accordance with Kantian injunc- tions, for our apparent willingness to re- gard them as endowed with rights." This last, however revealing of a question- begging attitude toward the problem at hand, is difficult to assess. Let us turn to the expression "quasi-person." While there is no doubt that art works have a special status among artifacts, it is extremely mis- leading to claim that we have a willingness to treat works of art as quasi-persons and extremely doubtful that a case can be made that we ought to treat works of art like persons or as "quasi-persons." The prefix "quasi" implies more than the symmetrical relationship resemblance. Forks are not quasi-fingers, nor fingers quasi-forks. We need take care to note that the establish- ment of common ways of treatment between analogy and analogue does not imply a sufficiency for treating one as the other, especially when it is understood that there is a manifold of ways in which persons treat persons. It would not take much to show in what ways art works and persons are not alike. Sticking only with Tormey's use of the Kantian injunctions, specifically the third formulation of the categorical imperative, we find an overriding difference: the condi- tion of autonomy. Perhaps we could say with Tormey that to the extent that works of art are quasi-persons we do have quasi- obligations toward them. But that is not saying very much at all. V What has happened in purportedly ascrib- ing rights to works of art can be described as a case of metaphorical transference; to say that works of art have rights is to speak metaphorically. Now the subject of meta- phor is one that deserves more attention than can be given here. But a few fast comments seem in order. We have with</page><page sequence="8">76 rights and works of art two essential ele- ments of metaphor: some degree of analogy and a suggestion to see things in a new way. Some metaphors disappear quickly from the linguistic scene. Others yet remain and take on new literal meanings. Sometimes this result is innocent enough: we know that certain sharp silverware doesn't taste tangy and that sharp cheese won't cut the flesh. But some can be dangerous and some morally repulsive. Calling a grown woman a "girl," for example, is to make a metaphor. It might be used to pick out features like, immatur- ity, need for protection, inability to do cer- tain things alone.8 The making of a meta- phor is not always morally neutral and I suggest that it is not in the case of rights and works of art. It helps foster a tendency, that though naive is somewhat seductive, especially in a civilization where objects already have a fetish-like status that in many contexts overrides the concerns of living things. A rejection of the use of the rights metaphor can help prevent the water- ing down of the concept of obligation, and the expanding of our concerns to pseudo- obligations. While its acceptance, I think, aids a cause that hardly needs an ally. VI I have tried then to show the kinds of difficulties that one encounters when trying to make a case for the ascription of rights to art works; that if we know what it is to have obligations to people, it does not follow that we also know what it is to have obligations to works of art, that something new is called for. That to say that a person has a right is to advocate a proposal and to deny that art works have rights is like countering a proposal of a very different sort. Thus Tormey's argument, if a good one, would result in a world in which per- sons had obligations towards most any arti- facts and one in which most any artifacts had rights, a world very different from our own. Taken as a suggestive metaphor there is not good reason to believe that suggestion worth adopting. GOLDBLATT 1'Alan Tormey, "Aesthetic Rights," The Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism (Winter 1973), 163-170. All quotations by Tormey will be from this paper. 2 Since de facto rights can be justified or un- justified, and since the term de jure is apt to be misleading, at least in this context, I am using the expression justified rights to refer to rights that the holder is justified in having whether or not those rights are ever protected or otherwise recognized. Similarly, I will be using the expres- sion justified obligation, to distinguish obligations from de facto obligations and from those that are legitimized by law only. The underlining will in- dicate this special use. The inappropriateness of contrasting expressions like "natural rights," "hu- man rights," for the context of artifacts should be obvious. 3I have chosen the class of artifacts rather than the broader class of objects to avoid any problem of attributing anthropomorphic purposes to natural objects. In the case of attributing purposes to artifacts the anthropomorphism is blatant but for- tunately uncontroversial. In the case of artifacts we can feel free to say that whatever purposes they have, they are purposes imposed upon them by rational beings who are responsible for their com- ing into being, and/or their use. 4 While P1 is often not made explicit, and often not needed to be made explicit, that there are comfortable contexts for the explicity of Pi, can be seen from the following account: In this century in music, in theater, in literature, in painting, sculpture, and film there has often been something enigmatic about an innovative art object, as if one who confronts it for the first time is somehow unprepared. In this respect the artist can be under- stood as a sensual, perceptual, and conceptual radi- cal. Indeed it is often those works that can be considered "breakthroughs" or pioneers in the his- tory of art that serve as paradigms for years to come for other works that may be more subtle or refined than it, but usually not more original or historically important. One may not know what features to pick out for study and would either be unable to comment significantly when asked or may put forth an entirely incorrect interpretation. While the obstacles for understanding may differ, one who is well versed in the arts until that point may be as disadvantaged as the complete novice, perhaps more so. In such cases one who does un- derstand can help to bring one who does not to a position of understanding or appreciation by offering certain prescriptions to follow, e.g., by shifting attention from an irrelevant aspect to a relevant one. Such prescriptions may be directives for understanding the general class of art works, e.g., painting; for understanding the particular genre, e.g., Cubism; for understanding the particu- lar object, e.g., Les Demoiselles d'Avignon; or for combinations of them all. 6 However it does seem in keeping with Tormey's intentions to hold that a black and white repro-</page><page sequence="9">Do Works of Art Have Rights? duction of say a Rothko, or a comic strip size re- production of a Lichenstein meet the requirements for initiators of aesthetic pain. 8 As Wasserstrom puts it: . . (I)f a person has a right to something, he (an properly cite that right as the justifica- tion for having acted in accordance with or in the exercise of that right. If a person has acted so as to exercise his right, he has, with- out more ado, acted rightly-at least prima facie. To exercise one's right is to act in a way that gives appreciable assurance of immunity from criticism.

Only human beings, as biological entities, exist and have interests; but, given their development and training as competent agents of this or that cul- tural sort, they learn to divide their efforts spon- taneously between their own personal interests and the doctrinally projected "interests" of purely fictitious (but not for that reason unimportant) entities.
