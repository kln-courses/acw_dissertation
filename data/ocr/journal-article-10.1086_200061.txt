B. Tylor developedin his 1871masterwork Primitive Culture, is one of an- Relational Epistemology1 thropology’s earliest concepts, if not the first.2 The in-tellectual genealogy of central debates in the field goes back to it. Anthropology textbooks continue to intro- duce it as a basic notion, for example, as ‘‘the belief that by Nurit Bird-David inside ordinary visible, tangible bodies there is nor- mally invisible, normally intangible being: the soul . . . each culture [having] its own distinctive animistic be- ings and its own specific elaboration of the soul con- cept’’ (Harris 1983:186). Encyclopedias of anthropology ‘‘Animism’’ is projected in the literature as simple religion and a commonly present it, for instance, as ‘‘religious beliefs failed epistemology, to a large extent because it has hitherto been viewed from modernist perspectives.

Animism, a 19th-century representation of an ethnographically re- searchable practice particularly conspicuous among in- digenous peoples but by no means limited to them, is depicted by them all as an ‘‘object’’ in-the-world.
