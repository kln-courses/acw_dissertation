<plain_text><page sequence="1">Letters For Want of a Word Dear Editor: An article in the March 24, 1995, edition of Science reports on the dis- covery of a master gene that governs eye development. The gene or varia- tions of this gene are found in such diverse organisms as insects, mollusks (squid) and mammals (humans). The implications of this discovery are that this master gene must have been es- tablished very early in evolution, per- haps as early as 500 million years ago, and was passed to these various groups as they evolved. It should not be too difficult to ac- cept the analogous idea that genes related to behavior (that increase sur- vival rates) such as aggression, kin- ship bonding, self preservation, threat displays, etc. also evolved early and are common in many animal groups. A few weeks ago I let my three-year- old granddaughter out of the car and turned to close the door. She took off across the parking lot into oncoming traffic. Without thinking, I yelled and ran after her, completely oblivious of traffic. It was an interesting reaction, strictly instinctive; an inherited re- sponse geared to survival of the spe- cies. She was not hurt (and, by chance, neither was I). In writing a friend, I wanted an adjective to describe how I shared this reaction of protecting close kin with many other species. I wrote, "My re- action was ?; I reacted as many other animals would." I could have used the word altruistic, relating my response to the altruistic gene, first proposed by William Hamilton in 1968, but I wanted to encompass a broader idea. My primitive response was linked to behavior commonly shared by many species of many diverse groups. The genes for such basic responses, just like the gene for eye development, must have evolved early in the history of evolution. Random House Unabridged Dictio- nary, 2nd ed., offered two words, atavistic (atavism) and zoomorphic (zoomorphism). Atavistic came close, but was off the mark. Atavism: la) The reappearance in an individual of char- acteristics of some remote ancestor that have been absent in intervening generations. lb) An individual embod- ying such an earlier type; a throwback. Atavism emphasizes the unusual or surprising reappearance of ancestral traits, like a human born with a tail or hairiness that completely covers the body. My reaction was no throwback, no surprise. It was as common as salt. Neither of the two definitions of zoomorphism were applicable since they refer not to behavioral traits but to resemblances of gods or humans to animal forms. May I offer a new word, anthropo- zooic; a term relating human to animal. Anthropozooism: An inherited human trait or traits thought to be, or ac- cepted as, shared with other animal species (e.g. pair bonding, aggression, territorial defense, etc.). Anthropozooic is the best I can come up with. If you can think of a better word, that's great-but we need a new word. So now I can complete my sentence: "My reaction was anthropozooic; I reacted as many other animals would." Think what this will mean to count- less students who get the dreaded comment "anthropomorphic" for dar- ing to attribute human traits to ani- mals in a sentence such as, "The chim- panzee died of grief." Is grief recognized by science as a solely hu- man response? I don't think so. (Nei- ther is depression. Prosac was first tried on monkeys in various stages of depression before it was given to hu- mans.) The student could counter, "Grief is anthropozooic. It is a trait we share with many other animals." Surely it's time that we recognize the work of scientists such as Lorenz, Goodall, Fosse, Wilson and dozens of others who have studied the behavior and social organization of species as diverse as geese, chimpanzees and ants, and found an astonishing num- ber of common traits. Although anthro- pomorphic is a useful word, perhaps it is overused. We should perhaps spend less time suggesting, rightly or wrongly, that some animal traits approach human characteristics and more time empha- sizing the fact that many of our human traits are anthropozooic, having arisen early in evolution and therefore shared with many other animal spe- cies.
