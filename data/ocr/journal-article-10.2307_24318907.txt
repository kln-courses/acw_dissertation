THE CITY OF BOOKS</page><page sequence="2">EDITORIAL R, Alberto RUY SANCHEZ „ich and suggestive, it feels like a work of fiction: a city within a fortress within a city. Rippling, concentric circles of words full of strength and urbanity. The Ciudad de los Libros, or City of Books—in Mexico City's La Ciudadela, once a fortress—is a kind of synthetic image loaded with meaning, like a hieroglyph, an icon in a codex, or an ideo gram. Deciphering it requires understanding its different parts and seeing how they allow meanings to cross-pol linate. f How magnificent for a library to be called a city rather than a paradise—which sounds more poetic, and which is an image so vividly described by Borges in his blindness—or then again, a collection of memories—per haps familiar yet dour and uninspiring. It is an auspicious name because it refers to plans, initiatives and politics. The image of a city conjures up a desire for people to come together, for everyone to gather in a public space. This may not erase our differences, but for that special moment which is reading, we are all equal. Whether rich or poor, famous or not-so famous, powerful or defenseless, we all stand before a public library bookshelf like birds roaming around a square, pecking at the same crumbs, splashing in the same drinking fountain, before flying away again, each following our own path. A city also lets us readers as-passersby to welcome the unexpected on our wander ings: an adventure could be waiting for us around any corner. Every city, experienced to the fullest, is a journey into the unknown, f The fortress that contains this library of libraries also acts as a metaphor for the fortitude of those who collected these books, figures of mighty intel lect who, each in their own way, transformed their sur roundings. Their power largely came from their libraries, from the act of creating them as a second skin, as another body that they nurtured. A body of books infused with their soul or, if you prefer, their mind. A body inhabited, a body possessed. J These exceptional twentieth-century Mexicans lived side-by-side with their books, day by day, their entire lives. Their libraries are powerful bodies, and all of us, whether we are furtive or systematic readers, can perhaps take advantage of their force, cell by cell, book by book. It would be hard to reconstitute these creations. Instead we must construct ourselves with this wealth of exceptional words, a resource that we would find difficult to access without this City of Books. Some essential mag ic—in the sense of the awe-inspiring multiplication of the possible and the real—exists in this transfer of strength from those bodies of words to our own. Books are intrin sically powerful or magic, especially if they have been col lected with passion over a creative, reflexive and obsessive life. They are like loaded dice, giving favorable odds. Each reading is a bet where everyone wins, f In this issue of Artes de México we offer a carefully reasoned and reason able decipherment of this ideogram of concentric circles. A preliminary reading involves recognizing the insightful cultural policy inherent in the project, as well as five pas sionate librarians and a historic building transformed by talent, with artworks that further enhance users' aesthetic experience. We have also included texts by writers who are formidable readers, in order to demonstrate the type of unexpected flashes that books can spark within us. The fascinating poem that can simply be a catalogue of books of a culture observed with curiosity from a creative dis tance; the story of a living library contained in a single book collected by someone who has been dispossessed of all material goods; an astonishing love story told through the simplest material things mentioned in books which nonetheless lead to unique moments and meanings in the mind of a poet. Indeed, this happens each day to hun dreds of readers who mix together dreams and words, life and memory. And we give the final word to a writer who is one of today's foremost thinkers on reading. He shares his ideas on what a public library needs to be, considering in particular this extremely generous act of turning pri vate book collections into public ones, a challenge and a gift which we as humble readers are beneficiaries of today. J To create a city, to become a city, is to create readers, to become readers ourselves. We continue to foster this na tion's strength by recognizing that Mexico's finest qualities come from its reflexive creativity, inscribed in a passion for books and born of books. Translated by Quentin Pope. A CITY AS UNIVERSE Th||l|prari Alberto MANGUEL library always holds the implicit notion of a certain individual or collective identity. But what defines that identity exactly? A national library, unlike someone's pri vate library, must obviously claim to house most of the works produced by the nation in question, and give citi zens access to all its collections. But for it to fully embody that identity, for it to be, in a sense, its emblematic image, it must surely possess something else, something that al lows its readers to recognize in it an illuminating duplic ity: it must be conservative but always expanding; rooted in the past but always translating that past into a future; a local yet de-localized center; a focused and eclectic ar chive; a microcosm and a macrocosm all under one roof. So how can a library achieve this type of unique univer sality? f Let us seek an example in Rome after the barbar ian invasions, f Legend, and perhaps history, tells us that at the end of the seventh century, Pope Gregory I, later given the overblown sobriquet The Great, decreed that no pagan book should enter the libraries of the Christian church; works by Livy in particular were banned because, for reasons unbeknown to us, the pope had a special aver 74 Alberto RUY SÁNCHEZ Quentin Pope. Alberto MANGUEL</page><page sequence="3">sion towards them. Believing it preferable to lose a few volumes of the true faith than to preserve entire shelves of diabolical works, Pope Gregory ordered that the old Palatine Library, located next to Apollo's Temple and founded by emperor Augustus in the first century, be burnt to the ground, f While the learned ashes of Livy and other impious authors floated above a Rome virtu ally in ruins, in a remote corner of the Roman Empire, the Archbishop of Seville, a certain Isidore, continued to expand his generous library with the works of authors from a variety of creeds. Over the door, he had the fol lowing words inscribed: "Here you may find all kinds of books, both sacred and profane." For the erudite linguist, this was the definition of a "library." f Time metes out its own justice. Gregory the (supposedly) Great now lies under the dome of Saint Peters in Rome and his epitaph proclaims him as the eminently bureaucratic "consul of God," divesting him of any intellectual weight. The read erly soul of Isidore, meanwhile, is one of the loving flames that Dante describes in the fourth sphere of his Paradiso, dealing with prudence, and his physical presence, in the form of a marble sculpture by José Alcoverro y Amorós, keeps watch over the entrance to the National Library of Spain, f Perhaps because history is a literary genre, major events conform to stylistic laws and syntactical regula tions. Our tragedies and comedies have their heroes and villains, their memorable dialogues and symbolic acts. With painstaking—and occasionally unsuccessful—artis tic effort, we construct our societies and institutions and over time, as happens in our memory with literary works, our actions are summed up in a just a few notable para graphs. And so it is with our ambitions and enterprises, our foundations and destructions, our endings and new beginnings. Our cities, like our books and artworks, trea sure meanings that their authors are often unaware of and symbols that, sometimes unwittingly, are arcane and yet universal. The architecture of a city emblematizes its his tory, and every society can claim as its own the epitaph that the architect Sir Christopher Wren composed for his father's grave in Westminster Cathedral: "Si monumen tum requerís, circumspice," "If you seek his monument, look around you." TWO EXAMPLES • "Economic crisis" is a phrase much bandied about these days, so it is worth recalling that in ancient medi eval tradition, usury was branded as being tantamount to murder. "You have no right to charge interest," Saint Ambrose tells usurers of yesterday and of today, "except to the person you have the right to kill." In our twenty-first century cities, usury takes the material form of emblemat ic towers that assert their Babylonian ambition like fangs pointing up to the sky. Towers and fangs: this is just how Dante depicts usury when he calls it the "old wolf," more ferocious than any other beast, pouncing on its victims. • For Ambrose, as for Isidore, intellectual pursuits—the opposite of usury since they give more than what is asked of them—are represented in medieval emblems not as towers that collapse but as upright columns: the Seven Pillars of Wisdom which, according to the Book of Proverbs, were carved by Wisdom "for her own house." These emblems are usually found on the neoclassical fa cades of traditional libraries—houses of wisdom if they ever were any. Some might call these facades authoritari an, stern, hierarchical, cold, imposing, lofty. Yes indeed, others would say, because the seven values of Wisdom are not chance, ease, superficiality, brevity, blind violence, triviality or pedestrianism, but rather intelligence, medi tation, profoundness, difficulty, reason, and what is al most eternal. Though usurers might have us believe oth erwise, reading is not a trivial task. 5 Neither is it an in consequential occupation. From their beginnings, over five millennia ago, readers have grown in the shadow of censors and politicians. The former believe, despite count less examples proving the contrary, that one can erase the past, put blinkers on the present, ransack the future, wipe out an idea after it has been expressed, and literally efface the words of shared memory. The latter think that, by de forming or devaluing the act of reading, they can trans form readers into mere consumers, weakening their pow ers of reflection and their critical faculties, a pre-requisite for blind consumption. And they may achieve their aim, but only temporarily, because both endeavors are ulti mately useless. However, this does show the authorities' extraordinary faith in the power of reading: the power to choose, to reason, to question, to transform, to remember, and to imagine better worlds, f Perhaps it is this convic tion—more keenly felt by enemies of reading than by readers themselves—which leads us to create, in every place we settle, places for reading. Obviously I am refer ring here to societies with a writing tradition. Oral civili zations have a different relationship to words, one that is equally effective and powerful but with different concepts of time and space. Societies with a history of books, in which memory is entrusted to written texts, use reading to set up a dialogue with the past. In oral traditions, this relationship is continuous, passing from mouth to mouth without any other time than that of the narration itself. The notion of space also changes: in oral societies, narra tors inhabit the space of their listeners and everything that is narrated belongs to that space. In societies using the written word, the library, although it exists in a specific place, offers a universal geography for its readers, since the written word has no borders. "Bulattal has brought me your message," says a letter written in Mesopotamia in the early-seventeenth century BCE, and sent from the Zagros Mountains to a reader in the town of Shemshara. "Your words have given me great pleasure. I had the feeling that you and I had met and embraced." The words read con verted this reader into a magical traveler, miraculously transported to the location of his absent friend. 5 This borderless geography created by the written word chooses the library as its central space. Our universe is defined by our point of view: despite Copernicus, we still imagine that galaxies revolve around our own lost little corner of the cosmos in which we happen to find ourselves. And so too our libraries: random centers of our universe. The seven seas and six continents overlap on the shelves of these symbolic buildings, along with all the constellations, suns and darkness, a vastness that sits on the desk of each reader and is summed up in a few lines of the text she or he is reading. The universal library does not exist, unless every library is universal, f Since time immemorial, or at least since Cain was forced to move to new pastures as his 75</page><page sequence="4">brother Abel had done, we have brought along our words with us—our books, our libraries—on our pilgrimages. Spain, as heir to Isidore of Seville (to his intellectual tal ents as well as to his anti-Semitism and other prejudices), cast his long shadow over the adventure of the conquest that others might call an invasion. Literate and illiterate soldiers that emigrated to the new continent took with them not only European mythology, from sirens and am azons to Christ the Redeemer suffering on a cross, but also the books that formed a memoir and a lexicon for these mythologies. It is moving to read in the chronicle of Christopher Columbus's first voyage that, upon seeing some manatees, the explorer believed he had seen "three mermaids who leapt high out of the sea, but," the admiral adds faithfully, "they were not as beautiful as in the paint ings." It is also moving to know that it was important for these men to bring along their books to these unknown lands. Pedro de Mendoza, founder of my native Buenos Aires, carried various volumes with him: "seven medium sized books bound in black leather," "a book by Erasmus," also of medium size and also bound in the same leather, a Petrarch, "a little golden book that says Virgil in it" and "a book that is a Bridia bound in parchment." It appears that de Bridia was a thirteenth-century historian who wrote a chronicle of the Tartars. If this is so, Pedro de Mendoza, on founding his city, desired the presence of thinkers who followed a religion other than his own (Erasmus), poets of other languages and countries (Petrarch and Virgil) and fellow explorers of a far north, distant from his far south. This is a roundabout way of saying that, for Pedro de Mendoza, a contemporary of Alonso Quijano, the intel lectual world was one, or in other words, that personal ventures must have a universal component. In any case, it is important to recognize that his impulse was to give the new city the foundations of a transported library and thus to ensure for himself a form of immortality by associa tion. J A form of immortality: perhaps this is what drives us, in societies of written words, to be literary nomads. Our endless migrations are accompanied by readings; we pack books into our baggage of exile; as we move to new pastures we travel with our cattle, stores, seeds, weapons, and our libraries too. The Mesopotamian peoples took sandstone tablets to their new settlements to communi cate the teaching of their laws and magical rites. The Egyptian kings created libraries in the most remote cities of their realms and inscribed "clinic of the soul" on their lintels, according to Diodorus Siculus who saw the majes tic ruins various centuries after they had been abandoned. In the fifth century bce, the young Alicibiades, visiting a far-off community during his voyage around the Greek colonies, punched a teacher in the nose when he did not find a single copy of Homer in his school, judging the man to have been in dereliction of his intellectual duty. One hundred years later, Alexander the Great, perhaps mind ful that the vanquished also have voices, always went on his campaigns with a copy of The Iliad. In the tenth cen tury, Abdul Kassam Ismael, Grand Vizier of Persia, in or der always to feel at home, took his library containing 117,000 books loaded on the back of 400 camels trained to walk so the volumes would remain in alphabetical or der. Exiles have long sought consolation in their books because these, as Marguerite Yourcenar would say, were their homeland. They could be numerous or just one. Prospero, in The Tempest, went into exile with his magical library, his source of power. Nabokov pined for his be loved Russia and was faithful to it with a Russian diction ary in his pocket. Gwendolen Fairfax, in The Importance of Being Earnest, states, "I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train." In this sense, every library is migratory. Every library is the cumulus of other libraries that have come to it along an infinite number of paths, like memories, tro phies, reliquaries, spoils of war—works that are stolen, chosen, chased, indispensable, rescued. 5 I would like to end with one of the most poignant stories I know and that somehow encapsulates everything I most value and love in these strange creatures that we call libraries. It is told by scholar Maria Rosa Menocal in the last chapter of her wonderful book on Spain's three cultures, The Ornament of the World, 5 On August 25, 1992, the Serbian army de liberately bombarded the National Library of Sarajevo, destroying over one million books and more than one hundred thousand valuable manuscripts. One of the few treasures that could be rescued was a famous illuminated Hebrew manuscript, known as the Sarajevo Haggadah, created in Spain at the end of the thirteenth or the begin ning of the fourteenth century. This book has survived not one but a whole series of catastrophes. The first was the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, exactly five centuries before the bombardment of the library in Sarajevo. Some pious reader, forced to abandon his beloved native Spain, had taken the Haggadah with him and, along with other Sephardic Jews, sought refuge in a certain city of the Ottoman Empire where, centuries later, in 1914, the arch duke Franz Ferdinand would be assassinated. A couple of decades later, during World War II, the Haggadah was saved once again, this time by a Muslim librarian from Sarajevo, who hid it in order to protect it from the Nazi tyrants bent on burning every Jewish book. J The follow ing story took place some seven years after the Serbian attack on Sarajevo, in the spring of 1999. Among the thousands of Muslims (or "ethnic Albanians" as they were called) expelled from Kosovo by the Serbs, there was a woman who carried with her, for sentimental reasons, be cause it had belonged to her father, a piece of paper writ ten in Hebrew script—a language she did not know. Herded together with her compatriots from the other side of the Macedonian border, the woman decided to show the paper to members of the Jewish community in the town where they had camped. It was a magical moment. The paper turned out to be a document granted by the government of Israel to the librarian who had not only saved the Sarajevo Haggadah but also provided shelter in his house to Yugoslavian Jews during the Nazi atrocities. The daughter of the man who had been a hero during the Second World War had herself been the victim of another barbarous act. With her identity revealed, she was rescued from the refugee camp and taken with her family to Israel where she was welcomed by a man who hugged her with tears in his eyes. He was the grown-up son of one of the Jews whose life had been saved by the Muslim librarian. "My father did what he did out of the goodness of his heart, not to receive something in return," said the wom an. "Now, fifty years later, this act has somehow been re ciprocated. It's come full circle." 5 This full circle is the one drawn by a library, beyond its walls, beyond the time of its 76</page><page sequence="5">construction, beyond its shelves and its books, for all those living at a given time and place, for readers but also for others: for those who do not go to the library, or for those, like Gregory "the Great," who denigrate it, or those, like Isidore, who nourish and expand it. For everyone. As Borges used to say, a library is just one of the names that we give the universe. Translated by Quentin Pope. rum h &lt; JUSTO SIERRA CITY OF LETTERS Writers' Libraries Wh Rafael VARGAS I hat inspires someone to create a library? Plenty of explanations are possible, yet the only crucial one is in fact very simple: the love of reading, f A nine-year-old boy finds that he now has twelve or fifteen books. Not books that the school gives him or asks him to buy. But his own ones. He chose one in a bookstore. He saved for two months to buy one. It was his birthday present. A friend lent it to him and shortly afterwards moved house—no one knows where he went. J And now they are his faithful companions: the Brazilian Saci, depicted by Monteiro Lo batos pen; Chingachgook, last of the Mohicans; Edmond Dantés, Count of Monte Cristo; el Zarco, always weighed down with silver, the scourge of Yautepec. He spends some of his day with them. They are his friends, f By the age of eighteen, the books have multiplied exponentially. If he were to list them, they wouldn't fit in a pocket ad dress book. They are constantly coming and going. Some disappear, others arrive. Just like people do. Now at thir ty-six, almost without realizing it, he has a library and a defined taste for a certain type of book. His books now resemble him, and he resembles his books—a semblance he will keep over the years. II A love of books develops very quickly and without plan ning. One book leads to another. They are always pleasant company. You want them all around you: a library is like a type of party, f And once the library becomes the cor nerstone of your life—once your work is based on the pleasure of reading—it takes on a life of its own. It starts spreading around your house. Books inhabit the living room, din ing room, bedrooms, corridors, kitchen, bathrooms... In fact, anyplace that is sheltered from the wind, the sun and the rain becomes a bookcase. Books climb onto tables and desks, they sit on sofas and armchairs, they come out from under carpets; mercilessly, they crush their compan ions. J Surely this was how Antonio Castro Leal, José Luis Martínez, Ali Chumacero, Jaime García Terrés, Carlos Monsiváis (names given in chronological order by date of birth, from oldest to youngest) created their librar ies—which are now brought together in the library called the Biblioteca de México "José Vasconcelos" to create an extraordinary literary archive, f The pleasure of reading turned all these men into writers, and writing unavoid ably turned them into what people call "voracious," "insa tiable" and "unstoppable" readers. The world of books can be powerfully tantalizing. A keen reader always wants to read every book out there: everything on science and po etry, everything on philosophy and history. Every single travel journal and geographic treatise. An impossible, ab surd, Faustian desire. You must settle for a tiny fraction. Tend to a small patch of garden, f Michel de Montaigne's library consisted of only a few hundred books; we do not know exactly how many. But we do know that they were enough to give him an acuity that most of us would be glad to have today, f Like Seneca, Montaigne condemned lack of self-control in regards to knowledge. He was aware that rather than reading a lot of books, it was more impor tant to read good books, excellent books. And to read them properly. In the words of the author of The Essays— it is not about what books teach us, but about how they make us exercise our minds, analyze and develop ideas, f However, ever since the printing press made massive print runs possible and books became more or less affordable, book lovers have found it hard to control their urge to acquire—money permitting—vast numbers of books. Al most any eighteenth-century man of letters would have had two or three times as many books as Montaigne. J To day Montaigne himself could not resist the temptation to keep several thousand tomes up in his tower. We can now access a truly massive, universal array of classical works of literature as never before. Ill In Mexico—as in Latin America in general—non-solip sistic writers will be obliged to build up large libraries over time if they wish to know where they stand and to appreciate the previous and current work of their peers. The reason is simple: public libraries in Mexico are usually inadequate. Limited acquisition budgets create huge holes in their collections, even in terms of domestic national publications. And the problem is worse still for import ed books: Mexico generally receives few copies of books printed in Spain and Latin America and these almost al ways end up in private hands, f The budgetary problem is compounded by the absence of a coherent strategy. And by the lack of continuity. A library is not merely a stack of books. It needs to be given direction. Otherwise it grows like a weed. The idea is to design a garden. 5 José Luis Martinez has just such a library: a garden carefully culti vated over seven decades. No one has given it better praise than Gabriel Zaid, who defines its virtue and uniqueness: 77 Rafael VARGAS</page><page sequence="6">No other library of Mexican literature can com pete with that of José Luis Martinez in terms of breadth and logic. Not even the National Library, which has the benefit of being the legal depository of all books published in Mexico and of being locat ed in the National University where literary research is carried out.[...] I can say this because some years ago I set about reading all the Mexican poetry that I had not yet read. In order to read out-of-print books, I became a regu lar visitor of the National Library in San Agustín and of the Periodicals and Newspaper Library [Hemero teca Nacional] on del Carmen Street, and I discov ered their limitations. Later, when I discovered José Luis Martinez's library, I was astonished that a single person had been able to create a far better collection. In fact, it is well known that Martinez's library, consisting of over 75,000 volumes, holds the most comprehensive collection of Mexican literature (including "splendid in digenous literature," as he liked to describe it) of all public and private libraries. This is confirmed by historian Ro drigo Martínez Baracs, also an expert on books, in his La biblioteca de mi padre (My Father's Library). This book gives a brief and engaging account of how his father José Luis formed his vast library, and also describes the vari ous collections within it: literature, history, art, reference works, philosophy, and periodical publications—one of the richest veins within the collection. (It should be noted that although José Luis Martinez's collection largely fo cused on Mexico, his concerns were clearly also univer sal). f If only such a story existed for every library created by our men of letters. A tribute paid by a son to his father, La Biblioteca is as special as its subject and sketches out an intellectual biography that, for myriad reasons, deserves to be expanded. IV A remarkable amount of information is available on José Luis Martinez's library. Fortunately, Martinez himself wrote a couple of extensive memoirs-cum-essays: Mis li bros (My Books), developed from a lecture he gave at the Academia Mexicana de la Lengua in 2006, and Bibliofilia (Bibliophilia). These document his pleasure for reading, his clear passion for knowledge and his desire to under stand the world, f On the other hand, little is known about the library that Antonio Castro Leal, the essayist, novelist and poet, began to create around 1911. This was the year he started teaching at the National Preparatory School, where he met many of the friends with whom in 1916 he would establish the Sociedad de Conferencias y Conciertos, the precursor of the famous group of the Siete Sabios, or "seven wise men," in which Antonio Cas tro played a prominent role. 5 Over a period of seventy years, Castro Leal collected around 50,000 volumes. As with José Luis Martinez, Leal's collection predominantly centers on Mexican literature—his main area of interest since he was eighteen years old when he co-edited Las cien mejores poesías (líricas) mexicanas (The Best 100 Mexican [Lyrical] Poems) with Manuel Toussaint and Al berto Vázquez del Mercado. In 1914, the same year as this book was published, he started teaching literature at the National Preparatory School, f Castro possibly formed many of his ideas on the importance of books and librar ies during his brief period as José Vasconcelos's private secretary in 1920, shortly before being appointed first sec retary of the Mexican legation in Chile, where the poet Enrique González Martínez held the post of plenipoten tiary minister, f Chile was to be the first of Castro's eight diplomatic postings (not continuous but punctuated by various returns to Mexico, the longest being from 1934 to 1949); he would later have posts in Santiago, Washington, Paris, London, Madrid, Warsaw and Amsterdam. He fin ished back in Paris where he was Ambassador for Mexico's Mission to unesco between 1949 and 1952. J His library (a pleasure to explore since it was opened to the public in two rooms of La Ciudadela) obviously reflects the periods he spent residing in these cities where he met many of the authors he admired, such as Gabriela Mistral and Pablo Neruda; André Malraux and Paul Valéry; and George Bernard Shaw (some of whose shorter works he had translated when he was seventeen years old for Julio Torri and Agustín Loera y Chávez's famous Cultura collection). These books and many others include dedications from their authors: in total there are over 1,400 autographed volumes here, f His collections in French and English are particularly important and together account for almost a third of his library—including one of the largest number of books held in any public or private library in Mexico by and about Shakespeare (Castro himself wrote a long and erudite essay on the Bard's tragedies).

Lazius had died the previous year and was gener ally held to be fatuous, a pseudo-intellectual and a pur loiner of documents from monasteries and libraries, f At first glance the oil painting seems to show the bust of a figure in a solemn pose, but we can then see it is noth ing more than a pile of books, some feather dusters and keys stacked in front of a curtain, f Yet with the passing of time (the world forgot about Arcimboldo and he was only rediscovered in the twentieth century by the Surrealists) and removed from its historical context, the paintings sa tirical purpose was lost: what was originally an attack on intellectual falsity is now usually considered an allegory of the reader and, as such, we can bring it up here and refer to the popular saying: "we are what we eat." f We are, in fact, everything that we perceive through any of the five senses, everything that we do, the objects we use, every thing we admire, everything that we desire. For those of us who are compulsive readers, books become an exten sion of life just as life becomes an extension of books, f Writers are inevitably identified by their books: those they write, of course, but also those they own. The library left behind by the scholar paints one the most accurate por traits of its creator. VI If not every book, I have read at least dozens, hundreds, a thousand, and I'm not saying this out of vanity, quite the contrary: after so many oceans of letters in my veins I am burdened by duties and have barely the right to wonder politely how many silent hours remain before we can see the real fruit, the pristine echoes of reading quickly seasoned by the dawn. "Sazón del alba" is the title of this poem that Jaime Garcia Terrés probably wrote around 1980 when he was fifty-six years old. He must surely have written it deep within his library, gazing at the shelves filled with books and with Mallarmes famous verse echoing in his head. It could now serve well as a type of portal leading into the gentle space where that same library opens out to welcome readers while protecting its charges, f Compared with the adjacent libraries of José Luis Martinez Antonio Castro Leal, this one is noticeably smaller, if that is the right way to describe a collection consisting of "only" 20,000 volumes, f What explains the difference? We could venture that, at a certain juncture in his life, Martinez, tormented by his love of liter ature but also by a parallel passion for history, saw the need to develop his collections beyond his own personal taste, beyond his immediate needs for information. So he decid ed that he must bring to completion what his sets of books required of him. And it is possible that Castro, fascinated by the past ever since he was a young boy, thanks to his friendship with Pedro Henríquez Ureña (who insisted that he, and Reyes, should delve into and reappraise Juan Ruiz de Alarcóns work), may have made a similar resolution, f A different perspective is needed for García Terrés' library. Firstly, it combines books inherited from both sides of his book-loving family. His paternal grandfather, the historian Genaro García, was director of the National Preparatory School and Mexico's National Library; his father, Trinidad Garcia, while not a bibliophile, was a well-read lawyer who left his son Jaime some his most cherished volumes. On his mother's side, his grandfather José Terrés was a lead ing physician and a respected teacher of medicine, f For someone with this ancestry, it is perhaps unsurprising that Terrés should have written his first book—Panorama de la crítica en México—when he was still just seventeen, as a re sult of which he soon developed a friendship with Alfonso Reyes, f (As it happens, Reyes played an instrumental role in the forming of the libraries which are now gathered to gether in La Ciudadela. Not only because he was the first Mexican writer who showed what was involved in putting together a large-scale and high-quality book collection, but also because he was the intellectual and moral mentor— and a close friend—of Martinez, Castro Leal, García Terrés and Ali Chumacero, whose library we will discuss below.) 5 That does not mean García Terrés inherited thousands of books. A year after Genaro Garcías premature death in 1920, his private library was sold to the University of Texas in Austin by his widow, so she could provide for her eleven children. (That collection provided the foundations for the extraordinary Nettie Lee Benson Latin American Collec tion, one of the richest source of works and archive materi als on Mexico and Latin America.) The young Jaime did, however, receive an invaluable lesson on the appreciation of books, f More than a bibliophile's collection, Garcia Ter réss library was that of a poet, meant for work, and indeed poetry dominates the pages of these thousands of books. Terrés had very refined interests and was able to read in six languages (French, English, Italian, German, Greek and, of course, Spanish), and he also had a passion for science and esoteric topics, as well as national and international politics, f García Terrés was director of the Biblioteca de México "José Vasconcelos" for six years. Now his personal library forms a permanent part of it. VII "When I got home after work," says Ali Chumacero, quoted by Ramón Córdoba in Pastor de la palabra (The Shepherd of the Word, 2004), "I returned to my library which is fairly robust, fairly violent, fairly large, and I car ried on working with books throughout the afternoon and into the night..." y Ali Chumacero also has a poets book collection. And one of legendary proportions, with over 46 000 volumes. As a collection of Mexican litera ture, it is said to rival José Luis Martinez's library in size. The winner of this contest will only be revealed once it has been fully set up. Ali said that he had read it all and that he had enjoyed it. He was proud of it, without being boastful. ("If I were to tell you what I had then you'd ask to borrow it," he joked). Houseguests would sit down to chat and 79</page><page sequence="8">have a drink, with part of the impressive library acting as a backdrop. Very occasionally, if the conversation took that direction, AH would go over to find a book and read aloud a paragraph or some verses, y Luis Chumacera, his eldest son, an avid reader and a skilled narrator, would be the ideal author for a book akin to that written by Rodrigo Martínez, y The fifth collection acquired by the National Council for Culture and the Arts to create a major liter ary collection in Biblioteca de México "José Vasconcelos" comes from Carlos Monsiváis, a tireless reader ever since his childhood days—which were certainly "peculiar" when compared to the Mexican norm. He describes them himself in a quick-fire self-interview in "Viaje al corazón de Monsiváis," Chapter Two of his autobiography: Q.: Tell us briefly about your childhood. A.: No street soccer for me, never any play ground games, or touch football, or "Can Carlos come with us for a hike in El Ajusco, ma'am?" No marbles at all. Instead, pornography: Monsiváis, pupil at Six A, proposes a new library.. And he was still peculiar in 1963 when Octavio Paz wrote: Monsiváis intrigues me: he is neither a novelist nor an essayist but a chronicler, yet his extraor dinary prose combines rather than dissolve these genres. A new language is born with Monsiváis, the language of a street-wise kid from Mexico City, a smart kid who has read all the books and all the comics and seen all the movies. Monsiváis: a new literary genre. Monsiváis's library, with its estimated 25,000 volumes, is as unique and varied as the man himself. It included all kinds of books (on art, literature, social sciences, music, politics, history), all kinds of magazines from all around the world. Over the years it became a jungle that devel oped a life of its own and one that only he knew how to get around, y At the far southern end, to the left of the en trance, was his desk, a type of clearing in the forest, if you could call it that, because its surface was piled as high with papers, books and newspapers as everywhere else. This was Monsiváis' refuge and nothing interrupted him here, except for the constant ringing of the telephone, an inop portune guest, or a soothing visit from one of his cats... VIII Once all these magnificent libraries have been set up and backed up digitally, the next steps are to conserve them, ensuring their safekeeping but without turning them into decorative objects. They must also be expanded, y At some point in their lives, Martinez, Castro Leal, García Terrés, Chumacera and Monsiváis doubtlessly saw their libraries become a project that they embraced, in the knowledge that their remaining years would only suffice to organize them so that others could benefit from them and contin ue their cultivation. Let us celebrate the fact that this has now become possible, y Ultimately the vocation for any private library is to become a public one. ¿0 Translated by Quentin Pope. SPRAWLING CITY iiiiiiiuil^ Aurelio ASIAIN I n English, they're called homeless, and so in Spanish we inelegantly call them roofless, sin techo. But strictly speaking, with their berths made from cardboard walls and blue tarps—the same blue tarps that are spread out on the grass in early April to contemplate the cherry trees—the dispossessed who take shelter under the bridg es of the Kamo River want for neither homes nor posses sions, though they do want for a mailing address. They are not vagrants: they roam the city to earn a living, but return home every evening. Obviously, few of them have bank accounts, but most do own some cooking imple ments, tools, flowerpots, small libraries. Many are collec tors. Foreign currency, whimsical bottles, shoes without mates, magazines, pieces of paper bearing notes written by strangers. They discover these objects by keeping their eyes to the ground, but they don't collect them to sell them, nor even out of a desire to amass more possessions; rather, it is perhaps out of a need for order. The objects encapsulate a calling, and perhaps hold a key. In any case, they are something to hold onto. These people store their treasures in their homes like one keeps a charm in one's pocket, y Noda barely has a home—a house without sto ries next to the river—but she carries her treasure in her pocket. She has only one book that she has read from be ginning to end who knows how many times; she knows it back to front, but peruses it every day, because it seems to grow bigger. Whenever she has a spare moment, she sits down and reads a few lines or a few pages. So a door may open in what had been a continuous string of words, and what had been advancing in a straight line may take an abrupt turn, and then something, or someone, may appear at that junction: perhaps a passage from another book read years ago, but now a vague memory. A question insinuates itself into the clear and solid line. Noda lifts her eyes and gazes at a cloud or at a tree, or at the birds on the river, or she shuts her eyes to feel the wind.

Everything proposed by the person who amassed it. A library is an extended and eloquent portrait. We learn about the owner from its volumes and its catalogue, from the covers of books and the notes written on their pages, from how the books are ordered and from the witnesses that have been forgot ten or voluntarily confined to certain pages of certain edi tions. This is why buying a given number of books isn't the same thing as acquiring a library. A library is memory, the map for the construction of a point of view, whereas indi vidual books are simply disconnected words. The director of the National Council for Culture and the Arts (Conacul ta), Consuelo Sáizar, was well aware of this when she set out to continue Vasconcelos' dream by creating the Ciu dad de los Libros, or City of Books, a project which, in the words of Sáizar herself, provides a glimpse of the living knowledge of the twentieth century. "By not acquiring or preserving the great li braries of the nineteenth century in Mexico, we have lost them. With this proj ect, we hope to prevent the same thing from happening to the collections of the past century. This was the mo ment to do it. There was not going to be a second chance." 5 The adventure began in 2008. On instructions from President Calderón, an ac quisition was made of the collection of the diplomat, editor, writer and academic José Luis Martinez. This scholar had conceived of his personal library as an essential part of his body of work. With the exhaustive passion of a collector, he amassed close to 70,000 volumes, attesting to his thoroughness; this bibliophile indeed ac quired complete collections of books and the back issues of the most important magazines, as well as entire ar chives of some of the newspaper supplements that have left a mark on our country, f Sáizar comments, "I was fa miliar with José Luis Martinez's library because he was a very generous man. His collection was semi-open to the public: you could always consult it. And he liked explain ing how he had gone about creating it. The fact of the mat ter is that there is a whole history underlying the volumes making up each personal library. What place was it given in the owner's home? How did its roots spread as the number of volumes increased? Which topics, languages and types of books did the owner decide to purchase? How were they classified? A library is a map showing the route taken by a person's thinking. And the City of Books, which combines the intellectual itineraries of five essen tial scholars of the twentieth-century, shows how these exceptional figures created, through their books, their own points of view. This project is conceived in order to give a complete reflection twentieth-century Mexican thought. The tour begins chronologically with Antonio Castro Leal's library. The later period is covered by the li braries of José Luis Martinez, Jaime García Terrés and Ali Chumacero, and finally, the cycle is closed with Carlos Monsiváis's collection, f The idea for the City of Books came about gradually. When Consuelo Sáizar took over as the president of Conaculta, the collection of José Luis Martinez was in the process of being catalogued by the Department of Libraries, though it had not yet been de termined where it would be stored. Sáizar saw that the best option was clearly the old building at La Ciudadela which had been inaugurated as a library in 1946 by Jaime Torres Bodet, the then secretary of education, and by José Vasconcelos, the library's first director, f Jorge Luis Borg es—an obligatory reference in all matters related to books—imagined that "Paradise will be a kind of library." Like Alberto Manguel and other illustrious people who have been bewitched by libraries, he showed us that they can hold a universe. Added to their labyrinthine nature, this must have put a lot of pressure on any builder of libraries: it cannot be a sim ple matter to conceive the building that will contain one. Several architects joined forces to build the City of Books. The first was Alejan dro Sánchez, who had also built the San Luis Potosí Center for the Arts. In Sái zar's words, "He seemed from the outset like a man who had a good understand ing of eighteenth-century buildings, an architect ca pable of respecting the surroundings and contrib uting innovations." Sánchez was in charge of conceiving a master plan for the majes tic building, as well as the design of the galleries that would hold the José Luis Martinez collection, f Spiraling over this paradisiacal space that features two stories of natural oak bookshelves, we find an installation by the artist Betsabeé Romero: a series of airplanes set to release books as if part of a food drop. Since the legendary library of Alexandria—which in addition to books contained a museum, a zoo, gardens, a meeting room and a kind of research institute—libraries have been imbued with the combined enchantment of books and art. In these uni verses, we often don't know whether the sense of vertigo arises from our encounter with an apparently infinite wis dom, from the rapture that the works produce in us, or from the eloquent confluence of the two. And yet some people have taken this proposal even further. For exam ple, the art historian Aby Warburg wanted his library to be a creative space—a "generator" that bore a closer re semblance to a Kunstkammer (cabinet of curiosities or &lt; Dr. Lakra. Untitled, 2012 (Detail). 8i Consuelo Sáizar Guerrero Gabriela OLMOS &lt; Dr. Lakra. Untitled, 2012 (Detail).</page><page sequence="10">cabinet of wonder) than to a museum. The City of Books emerged as one of those exceptional spaces. "I had seen Betsabeé's works using airplanes," states Sáizar, "so I invited her to install some of them here. I was thinking perhaps three or four of them, but her creative genius led her to make an artwork that is both ethereal and forceful, using books, book titles and authors' names, thus honor ing José Luis Martinez's dual vocation as a diplomat and as a great reader." J I wonder if Betsabeé Romero's Little Airplanes fly out of their spiral formation at night to roam the library's aisles. I wonder whether they scan the anno tated cards that this booklover often inserted into his editions in order to avoid writing in the margins. I won der if they noticed that viceregal book which Martinez affirmed may contain an unknown text by Sor Juana, f When the José Luis Martinez Library project was just get ting off the ground, the City of Books was beginning to emerge as if from a dream to establish its existence in real life. Such are bibliographic passions: once they have put down roots, they spread into every ambit of the possible, every emotional terrain, into the spaces of desire and of creative imag ination. As passionate about books as she is about architecture or technol ogy, Sáizar heeded the urgent demand behind that dream and decided to make it a reality. At that point, she in vited the architect Bernardo Gómez Pi mienta to join the adventure. And so Gómez Pimienta, along with Alejandro Sánchez, created a mas ter plan for this city of books, "with a dual em phasis on respecting the building and giving it a new expression, but always with great respect for the intervention done by Abraham Zabludovsky in 1988." f An advisory council was formed at that time, with the participation of José G. Moreno de Alba, Ernesto de la Peña, Eduardo Matos Moctezuma, Sabina Berman, Guadalupe Curiel Defosse, Joaquín Diez Cañedo, Enrique Florescano, Javier Gar ciadiego, Margo Glantz, Enrique Krauze, Jaime Labastida, Miguel Limón, Alfonso de Maria y Campos, Arturo Mencha ca, Estela Morales Campos, Louise Noelle, Adolfo Rodríguez Gallardo, Teresa Vicencio Alvarez, Eduardo Lizalde, Roberto Vázquez, Fernando Alvarez del Castillo and Consuelo Sáizar. 5 "Nearly anyone who becomes involved in the world of books, even surreptitiously, can identify the legendary li braries of the twentieth century," Sáizar goes on to say. The effort to acquire the collection of Antonio Castro Leal began soon after the Ciudad de Libros was conceived. Dean of the unam, director of the Palace of Fine Arts, a diplomat and a scholar, Castro Leal amassed a library that built a bridge between Mexico and Spain, as well as to France and Great Britain. Castro Leal's collection attests to the fact that only a library can contain the entire world and several other worlds within a limited space at one and the same time. 5 Bernardo Gómez Pimienta was in charge of the architectural project to refurbish the galleries that house this collection. In the process, he paid several visits to the former home of this man whose library, like so many others, could inspire withdrawal, an introspective mood. The architect was able to reproduce this same ef fect in the City of Books through a combination of light and dark woods, with led lighting bright enough to allow comfortable reading. Withdrawal and illumination: the medieval monks who were such aficionados of reading would no doubt have resorted to poisoning if it had helped them achieve such a fortunate combination, f Alejandra Zermeño created the artwork that inhabits the Castro Leal Library. The human figures in it adopt the postures of The Three Methods of Creation: Observation, Reflection and Projection. What captivated Sáizar about the work was the fact that "the figures break with the solemnity of the library and also play with the notion that one con stantly feels watched." I suppose the day will come when readers and books alike will become used to this playful vigilance. I imagine that some of the library's volumes have already be gun a flirtation with those beings: perhaps by now the books have se ductively offered their pages so the sculptures might inhabit them— like the characters of Serbian writer Goran Petrovic who watch each other, meet, fall in love, ponder things, become pro jections of one another, and live the best of their possible lives within the pages of a book. 5 The third library to join the City of Books was that of the editor, poet and diplomat Jaime Garcia Terrés: a collection of nearly 20,000 carefully selected volumes. García Terrés was not obsessed by ac quiring complete collections and did not require any material unrelated to his intellectual pursuits, so his private collection is carefully selected and focuses on spe cific topics such as literature and psychoanalysis. It also includes a number of dictionaries. 5 Saidee Springall and José Castillo were the architects behind this space, which combines the sobriety and elegance that came so natu rally to García Terrés, and the intimacy communicated by one detail that caught the attention of his widow, Celia Chávez, and his son, Alonso García Terrés: a corner that contains his favorite books, made possible by his family who understood his idea of paradise and how he found small pieces of paradise within such a vast bibliographic garden. 5 The Jaime García Terrés Library at the City of Books features an installation by Perla Krauze entitled Suspended Time, with which the artist "has infused this space with colors and resins that become the focal point of the place they beautify," according to Sáizar. With this piece that hangs from the ceiling, Krauze may have in tended to evoke a poem by Octavio Paz (translated by Eliot Weinberger): "Each drop of water / a fixed eye / the 82</page><page sequence="11">weight of enormous beauty / on each open eye / Reality suspended / on the stalk of time / beauty weighs nothing / Peaceful reflection / time and beauty are the same / light and water // Gaze that sustains the loveliness / time en chanted in a gaze / world weightless." Or perhaps she is only alluding to the time out of time that is poetry, or the time free of the yoke of seconds, minutes and hours which is experienced by any reader who gives him or herself over entirely to the seduction of the library, f Ali Chu maceras collection at the City of Books also presents an affectionate portrait of this extraordinary poet. Consuelo Sáizar tells me that Ali had worked, as she had, in the Fondo de Cultura Económica, as had José Luis Martínez and Jaime García Terrés, albeit at different times. Alí Chu macera, Sáizar adds, "was a man with an expansive per sonality, and he literally devoted his life to books. When he moved into his house in San Miguel Chapultepec, there was a tree in the patio. As the library grew, so did the house, until it had surrounded and contained the tree. Jorge Calvillo is the architect in charge of the galleries that will house this collection. He's the son of a very dear friend of Alí Chumaceras, so he experienced firsthand the ex pansion of the house that wound up welcoming in the tree, and he wanted to revisit that idea in the library, which also has a very interesting ventilation system." J Perhaps Calvillo envisions that readers will show the same humility with which Socrates's students absorbed the wis dom that the philosopher transmitted to them at the base of a tree when they approach this paradise that also fea tures a tree at its center, though its fruits are not forbidden. This garden of letters is also inhabited by a "muse," in Chu maceras words—a bust that the sculptor Luis Ortiz Monasterio once gave to the poet. J The writer Carlos Monsiváis left a profound mark on the City of Books He was a close friend of Consuelo Sáizars, and they talked about the scope of such an intellectually ambitious proj ect: "Carlos used to say that there had been three great cultural achievements during the twentieth century," Sái zar recalls. "The creation of the Ministry of Public Education and the establishment of an autonomous university; the foundation of the Fondo de Cultura Económica and of the Department of Cultural Diffusion at the National Autonomous University of Mexico; and the creation of the television channels Canal 11 and Canal 22. He said that it was time to begin planning our great cultural achieve ments of the twenty-first century, and that acquiring, preserving and digitizing book collections was the first step." The process of digitizing the volumes contained in the City of Books has already begun. And though this is a long-term project, as is often the case with bibliographic passions, substantial progress has already been made, f Carlos Monsiváis's library is the fifth and final collection to be integrated into the City of Books, and it is a wonderful complement to the other four. In Sáizars words, "Monsiváis defined himself as the first Mexican-born American. He was voracious when it came to American literature and art. He was a man very much aware of the social movements of the time, which is reflected in his bibliographic approach. He had a keen interest in the major artistic, photographic and pictorial movements of the twentieth-century and a great passion for music, art and hardboiled fiction." f Monsiváis's close friend Javier Sánchez was in charge of the architectural project for the library of this great chron icler of Mexico's capital city. He had also designed the Museo del Estanquillo at Monsiváis's request, so it seemed only natural for him to be commissioned to adapt the gal leries that would house the writer's collection. Sáizar points out that Sánchez's project "respects two almost in separable characteristics of Carlos: chaos and his love for this city. In this library we will be able to see the skyscrap ers, but the arrangement of the books will appear chaotic, something that is very much in the spirit of Carlos." f Thus, it seems that the Monsiváis library at the City of Books will display during the day that which Alberto Manguel experienced in his own library each night: books returning to the primordial chaos, to that fertile disorder that is the hotbed of all possible worlds. J To instill life into this space, Francisco Toledo designed a floor that de picts Carlos Monsiváis's cats as well as bookshelves on which rest the Bible next to his books about cats. The journalist Braulio Peralta has stated that "this is the mural Toledo had never made." f City of books, universe-city, game-city, city of light, city without time, city from which all possible worlds are born, word-city: this project attests to the influence that dreams can have when it comes to books. Sáizar emphasizes that the dream right now is to construct memories for the future of Mexico: the memory of sound at the Fonoteca Nacional, of images at the Cineteca, and of words at the City of Books, fulfilling the dream that José Vasconcelos had not finished making reality. While he was sketching out a program for the then-nascent Min istry of Public Education, Vasconcelos wrote that he had told Alvaro Obregón that "What this country needs is to start reading the Iliad" And so he conceived a Ministry whose work focused on schools, the fine arts and libraries. And he was emphatic about the need to establish a na tional library in "the best building in the country: one that rivals the Cathedral and the National Palace," going on to describe a kind of temple that would foster the amassment of knowledge, f This is how the City of Books emerged, "in order to preserve the treasures of the world's printing presses," to quote Vasconcelos once again. Moreover, it reveals to us the mental maps of five pillars of twentieth century Mexican culture, it urges us to inquire into their intellectual pursuits, and it also provides us with lists of suggested reading for the young people of today. We can consider ourselves well served if just one of the visitors to this library of libraries is infected with the madness expe rienced by Alonso Quijano when his brain became inflamed by reading: "He became so absorbed in his books that he spent his nights from sunset to sunrise, and his days from dawn to dark, poring over them; and with so little sleep and so much reading his mind withered and he lost his wits. His fancy grew full of what he used to read about in his books, enchantments, quarrels, battles, challenges, wounds, seductions, loves, agonies, and all sorts of im possible nonsense; and it so possessed his mind that the whole fabric of invention and fancy he read of was true, that to him no history in the world had more reality in it." And the fact is, the only way to trace a new and better path for this country is to allow power to fall into the hands of that creative imagination which can only be born of an unrestrained and delirious passion for books and reading, ¿ft Translated by Michelle Suderman. 83</page><page sequence="12">CITY IN FLUX PLANNING AND CONSTRUCTION The Bourbon Reforms, dictated and executed by the Spanish crown in New Spain, mainly during the second half of the eighteenth century, set up, among other things, a government-controlled tobacco monopoly or estanco, similar to those already established in Peru, New Granada and parts of Europe. Since 1761, the crown urgently need ed to control the harvesting, manufacturing, sales and taxation of this burgeoning industry that was creating handsome profits. This estanco was officially established by royal decree in 1763. It proved detrimental to many small-scale tobacco growers and some middlemen whose business depended on free trade: the former because they were forced to adapt to the harsh conditions imposed by the government bureaucrats, and the latter because they became gradually marginalized, f We know that an initial factory was set up in 1769 on the street then called Cade na—now Venustiano Carranza—in Mexico City, and it soon reached capacity. Other factories opened in Puebla, Orizaba, Queretaro and Guadalajara, as well as another one in the north of the capital, on the road to Queretaro in a district called La Lagunilla. Even this could not cope with demand. Hence a decision was taken to build a single, large construction for both factories just outside the center of the city; in 1783, 7,000 men and women were employed at the two existing factories. J Charles III of Spain had already approved the construction of the Royal Tobacco Factory in 1776. However, the order was never carried out. Histo rian Sonia Lombardo wrote that two projects existed be tween 1791 and 1792 to meet this demand. The first was by an engineer called Manuel Agustín Mascaré, and the second by an architect called Antonio González Ve lázquez, who had arrived in New Spain as director of the San Carlos Academy in 1786. The San Fernando Academy in Madrid rejected Mascaros proposal, of which we have no details, and raised objections to the one submitted by González Velázquez, who was instructed to make correc tions. 5 González Velázquez's proposal is held in the Gen eral Archive of the Indies in Seville. It stands out for the rational layout and symmetry of the proposed building; its neo-classical style was unsurprising given its authors background. Other aspects worth mentioning include its large size: it would occupy an entire city block with fa cades on all four sides. Around its perimeter were a series of galleries (where the cigarettes would be manufactured or the tobacco leafs rolled into cigars), with a number of smaller rooms attached to each. An adjoining corridor would act as an entrance to each of these rooms and in the middle a large square courtyard would be used to dry the leaves upon their delivery to the factory. In the center of the open space would be the cernidor or shredder (where the tobacco would be blended), with a Greek-cross floor plan, leading onto a series of arcades dividing up the large patio into four smaller ones, f A former ejido plot of land owned by the Atlampa indigenous community was cho sen for the new factory, in the southwest, near the aque duct that ran from the Chapultepec springs toward the capital, and which was beginning to feel the pressure of urban growth at that spot. The plans and the record of the complaint filed by the owners are kept at Mexico's General 84 CiudficLela The City of Books |||{the m ARK lliilt IME A, AN Xavier GUZMÁN URBIOLA . need must exist before a building is made, a need that must be met once construction is complete. The decision to create this particular building was the Spanish mon archy's imperious craving to control tobacco distribution in the richest of its American possessions, and to have a place to manufacture cigarettes as well as to monopolize their production and sale. And by filling the royal coffers, the Spanish crown could then finance its colonial policies and its European wars. 5 But what happens when original needs are superseded by new ones? Public and private buildings almost always have to adapt to various events and changing fortunes. The best ones have been able to make this adjustment, with varying degrees of success, due to their versatility and life history. These structures have evolved and matured over the years, sometimes suf fering mutilations, but in each case their walls tell stories about their lives. &gt; Cayetano Basave.

In 1793, the viceroy, the Marquis of Branciforte, dis covered that, without the definitive plans, the engineer Miguel Constanzó had begun construction work on the factory. Constanzó was another native Spaniard, who at that time already had relevant experience after having built three factories: the mint (Casa de Moneda), and two gunpowder factories, one in Santa Fe and the other in Chapultepec. Branciforte also discovered that the archi tect Ignacio Castera, as the city's chief contractor or Mae stro Mayor, had bought various plots of land in the same area and especially in the wetlands in the area between the urbanized part of the city and Atlampa. Alongside what were now his lands, Castera proceeded straight away to open up a large avenue that would later be called Paseo de la Independencia (now Bucareli), Paseo Nuevo (now Victoria), as well as the street that has been known as Re villagigedo ever since. He even built his own house in the same area. Castera therefore controlled the city's expan sion toward the parcels of land where he held real estate interests: the area bordering the Atlampa ejido. Thus the factory played a role in that game of chess surrounding the nerve center benefiting from the new roads. Castera became a wealthy man. It was never revealed whether Re villagigedo also had a stake in these interests together with Castera, nor do we know the extent of Constanzó's involvement, but it would seem naive to look at the vari ous facts ignoring the context. In any event, Branciforte suspended Constanzó's construction works until a defi nite approval of the plans and budgets. By then, progress had already been made on the factory's foundations. The construction's developers exerted intense pressure. How could the city's expansion be held in check if avenues and streets were already usable? How could the construction work on the building be prevented when it was necessary for the profitable estanco that justified its very existence? It was necessary to give at least an appearance of legality and pretend not to be acting on decisions taken by indi viduals based on their private interests and whose influence was brought to bear on matters as public as those concern ing the city itself. The struggle soon ended. Building work on the factory was resumed in 1796, but everything seems to suggest that progress was halting. In 1804 work once again recommenced, this time with greater urgency, and was finally concluded in 1807. 5 Constanzó made several major changes to the plans drawn up by González Ve lázquez. He transformed the cernidor into an area with a rectangular footprint and with fewer entrances; he em phasized the separation of the large courtyard into four smaller ones, encircled around its perimeter by an ar cade; he increased the number of small courtyards to eleven (five along the central east-west axis and three on each of the east-west axes that were connected to the north and south entrances), and he preserved the layout of the walled spaces with their four orientations but scrapped the small rooms attached to each one. J How ever, despite the sacrifice imposed on the Atlampa indig enous community and the huge sums of money invested, the effort of architects and engineers and the work of countless laborers and craftsmen, the building only oper ated as the Royal Tobacco Factory for barely eight years— until 1815. f And yet we know little about this building, even with its exceptional urban presence. To complement the information recorded by José María Marroquí, Manu el Toussaint, Sonia Lombardo and Guillermo Tovar de Teresa, we can now add archive documents found in vari ous libraries (in addition to those mentioned above: the Department of Historic Monuments' Archive of the Na tional Institute of Anthropology and History [inah], the Military History Archive, to give two examples), as well as information obtained during the restoration work and from various perforations, f In 1979, Sonia Lombardo re ceived authorization from Adrián Brun, then director of the School of Handcrafts, to make a perforation in the courtyard annex just south of the cernidor. She concluded that the series of vaults found formed part of the founda tions and, given that documents attest to the existence of at least two springs on the plot, it was reasonable to think that the area was unstable and would need this prepara tory infrastructure work to raise the building up and thus prevent its total, partial and/or asymmetrical subsidence. However, upon visiting this perforation today, it would appear that the layout, slopes, channels and narrow ducts formed part of a drainage system, and that the vaults were the building's foundations. However, further perforations were made in 2010: two in the central-east gallery and an other one in the northwest area. Each revealed a system of vaults similar to those found in 1979, supporting the con struction through continuous load bearing. Unfortunate ly it has proved impossible to dredge any of them in order to examine their contact with the earth on their lower sec tions (this is the big question), and to conclude whether they are indeed foundations, a drainage system, a means to control damp and therefore keep the tobacco dry, or a combination of the above. If a system of vaults exists be neath the entire building, as appears to be the case, this huge mass of masonry would clearly explain the exorbi tant cost of its construction, the recorded expense of mov ing vast quantities earth, and the continuous delays to the project. It would also account for how the building has withstood the subsidence that has posed an endemic problem for Mexico City for over 200 years, even with Line 2 of the metro built right on its eastern edge, and Line 1 to its south, only slightly further away—both con structed from 1967-1970. The hidden structure under La Ciudadela is an engineering work that must be preserved. It is evidently of great importance, not just as a foundation for the building but as the witness and proof of Mexico's history of construction and also because it has yet to be fully explored or understood. 5 Stone masonry was used as the building material and construction system, with a balanced combination (tezontle or volcanic stone was mainly used for the walls, given its light weight; docu ments in the agnm draw attention to the peculiarity of this material sourced from the Peñón, but also heavy ba salt was used for the foundations), mixed with sand-based mortar and especially lime for the foundation and walls. Acquiring lime was a real challenge and involved the ar chitects Constanzó, Castera, the city's top builders, and even several viceroys. It suited the indigenous producers to smuggle it into the city without declaring it at the gates in order to secure a higher price for it, while for the archi tects it made more sense to buy it at the source, thus sav ing them 200% or more. Much was written about this 85</page><page sequence="14">topic. And so, again, this interesting story is spiced up by the efficient use of lime in the building. Therefore it is worth understanding the manufacturing, curing pro cesses and usage to rescue these processes today. J A ma sonry wall has always been built using boards, string guides and a plumb line. Every original wall in La Ciud adela measures a minimum of one vara castellana (0.84 centimeters), but many others exist in various materials and sizes from subsequent refurbishments. Wooden crates were used to transport the prepared lime and ma terials for the aggregates and for the finishes. The exter nal and internal walls were plastered to protect them from both outside seepage and from the damp subsoil, and were further strengthened with solid stone founda tions and large overhangs. The paving was finished with black recinto stone—porous for the flooring exposed to the elements, and impermeable for the overhangs and cornerstones. The original roof system used beams, tiles and bricks. Almost all the wood came from Contadero, specifically the woods on Cerro de las Cruces. A won derful letter is kept at the agnm, signed by Manuel Tolsá, explaining the care needed when obtaining the wood—it could well have been written by an environmentalist to day This is not merely a curious fact but once again re fers to the overwhelming presence of history in the pres ent. f La Ciudadelas rational, neoclassical style is very much of its time and what you would expect from a building planned by the Director of the Academy of San Carlos. "Chiluca" stone was used to achieve this effect, and can be found in all the door frames (in the interiors and exteriors), windows, cornices, entablatures, capitals and columns, pilasters and arches of the arcades in the interior courtyards. The ashlars for each of these con struction elements were cut and worked using tradition al methods and superb stone masonry techniques. The cantera and basalt stone were extracted from Peñón Vie jo. Forged or wrought iron protects the buildings exteri or windows. Many of the construction materials were transported all the way to the construction site in canoes, using the branches and tributaries of the Acequia Real, a water channel that was still navigable in that period, f There are other interesting facts about the construction. While El Pocito de La Villa was constructed by architect Francisco de Guerrero y Torres between 1777 and 1791 with alms and without hurry over a fourteen year period using the traditional system of guilds, almost in parallel the Royal Tobacco Factory used piecework contracts, ad ministrative supervision and with supplies delivered as punctually as possible. This shows another aspect of the neoclassical: the rationality was not just in outward ap pearance but involved efficiency and economy in the ac tual construction process; the delays to the building work were due to other factors, proved by the fact that once work resumed in 1804 the building just took three years to be completed. 5 Conceived as a modern and hy gienic factory, the building also became the first manu facturing center in New Spain to use what we now call the "production line" method. As such, a series of spaces and architectural solutions were devised to rationalize the process; as described by Marroquí, the bushels of to bacco, mainly from Veracruz and Compostela, were brought in through the south door and so this was logi cally also where the accounts and treasury departments were located. The raw material was then classified accord ing to its quality, condition and level of moisture on its arrival, and taken either to the storerooms or the court yards for drying. Then it was collected at the cernidor, where it was shredded and made into different blends, before being taken to the courtyards where, each in sepa rate areas, the men and women made cigarettes, or rolled and twisted the leaves for cigars. Men worked in the two south courtyards (for this was also where they unloaded the tobacco), and the women worked in the north court yards. The paper stores for cigarette manufacturing were adjacent. And on that same site, a little to the north, the products were tied up or packaged, and then taken through the central north door toward the plaza where a detailed inventory of production was carried out by the accounting, control and record-keeping departments, be fore the shipment went out. THE BUILDING'S USES AND THE EVENTS THAT TOOK PLACE THERE The former factory, once its original purpose was forgot ten, became a military prison. This was where José María Morelos was imprisoned for a month, between his trial at the Inquisition building and his transfer to the town of Ecatepec where he faced a firing squad. These events motivated Carlos Maria de Bustamante to write a curious little book in 1825: Historia militar del general don José María Morelos. Then La Ciudadela—thus baptized for being a safe enclave for Mexico City—was transformed into an arsenal and military barracks, because during that same year a large consignment of arms arrived that the government had purchased in Europe thanks to the in famous and disastrous loans taken out with the Barclays and B. A. Goldschmidt &amp; Co., negotiated in London by Francisco de Borja Migoni. With this new use, the court yards needed to be tiled because otherwise the artillery units struggled to pull their cannons in an emergency. Other changes included a new perimeter protection ditch, guard towers, and the addition of rooms to the interiors. Those who occupied the rooms (such as the barracks commander in around 1830) complained of damp due to the canals and ditch flanking the building. 5 However, over the course of the nineteenth century, La Ciudadela changed from being a protective enclave for the city to the preferred venue for staging coups against the established authority in turn and its headquarters in the capitals center. As a barracks and arsenal it was ideally located to protect, or to attack, the nearby National Palace. Manuel Rivera 86</page><page sequence="15">Cambas documented all the attempted coups, revolutions and military uprisings for which the building served as a backdrop. This was where General Gabriel Valencia strengthened his position between December 1844 and January 1845, before betraying President José Joaquín de Herrera and supporting General Mariano Paredes. But Paredes's moment of triumph was short-lived: as soon as he supposedly tried to sally forth and defend the Repub lic, shortly after the Mexican-American War broke out, General Mariano Salas issued a proclamation—again, in La Ciudadela—in support of the 1824 constitution and backing General Antonio López de Santa Annas return. Many other such events took place: even President Benito Juárez had to put down one such uprising in 1871, after which he ordered the closure and removal of the arsenal that had previously been kept there, f By transforming the building into an armory, the courtyards were roofed with well-ventilated metal structures that provide ample natural light for the carpentry workshops, tanneries, ov ens and lathes. During the regime of Porfirio Díaz, a cast iron watchtower was erected in the southwest part of the building, where it still stands today. Also during this final period, an Artillery Museum was created in the northwest section of the complex; it was photographed by Guiller mo Kahlo, and the prints are kept in the inah s National Photograph Library (Fototeca Nacional), f Some years later, Generals Félix Díaz and Manuel Mondragón, hav ing failed in their attempted coup on the National Palace, used La Ciudadela to build up their power in February 1913. And it was there, shortly afterwards, opposite the north entrance, they killed Gustavo Madero, brother of the president of the Republic. While Felix Diaz observed the unruly soldiers who sung El pagaré, Madero—experi encing a frightful psychological regression—began shout ing at his mother and begging for mercy. Not content with the blood bath, the crowd then shot the governor, Adolfo Bassó, as punishment for his loyalty to Francisco I. Made ro, the constitutional president. Bassó, true to his roots in the navy, raised his gaze to seek Ursa Major as he took the bullets. Alfonso Taracena, Manuel Márquez Sterling and Friedrich Katz are just some of the authors who have written about various events during the so-called Decena Trágica, or the Ten Tragic Days. *¡ The most significant change made to the building during the second half of the twentieth century began with José Vasconcelos's return to Mexico. He had gone into exile following his defeat at the 1929 elections, and returned in 1939. Between 1941 and 1947 he was director of the Biblioteca Nacional and be tween 1945 and 1959 he was founder and director of the Biblioteca de México at La Ciudadela. For this undertak ing, Vasconcelos was only given the northwest section of the building: the rest of the complex remained the head quarters of the army and the police. His offices were at the highest point of the building, where the Artillery Mu seum had once been, and the large reading room was its adjoining courtyard. The director immediately commis sioned Angel Zárraga to decorate it with a series of four murals, only the first of which was completed due to the artists death. Within a short span of time, Vasconcelos, who was a "despotic" director of the library in the opin ion of José Joaquín Blanco, made it one of the best in the country. The reasons for this success include its budget allocation and—as Vasconcelos himself mentioned dur ing the library's inauguration—its policy of continuous acquisitions, its subscriptions to specialist magazines, its inclusion of recovered and donated collections—for in stance the collection of the then-recently deceased An tonio Caso, the Palafox Collection of clerical documents, and a collection that had disappeared and then resurfaced as the Social Sciences Library. All these formed the li brary's Fondo Reservado or Reserves Collection. Another curious fact is that Vasconcelos had nowhere to house his sisters, and pondered letting them use the gallery in the building's west wing, looking out onto Tresguerras Street. This situation was reported by the Ahumada Vasconcelos brothers, who went to visit their aunts, and then to their grandfather's office, and while one door in the reading room led to the women's home, the one next to it led to the director's office, f Between 1987 and 1988, the archi tect Abraham Zabludovsky undertook a major overhaul of La Ciudadela, one that could even be called question able. Nevertheless, this rehabilitation work doubled the space given over to collections, services and consultation rooms, turning the library into a public space well loved by the surrounding community. Not just the preserve for learned readers, the library also attracts flocks of children who come to do their homework; blind people, since it has a specially designed space for them; elderly locals who come here to read the newspapers; and even passers-by who walk through the building and find somewhere to rest or to read a book or a magazine. THE MARKS OF TIME AND THE "CITY OF BOOKS" The building's walls bear witness to the work carried out in its interior, as well as the various events that have left their mark on them—signs of its life and times. The carved ashlars in both the inside and outside of the doorframes, those visible on the facades with exposed columns (some made of a single block) and topped with superbly crafted pediments, show or reveal several marks, scratches, nicks and impacts. These are exciting finds, because the curb stones failed to protect these walls that were marked by the covered wagons that once transported tobacco. It is equal ly astonishing to walk around the building and find the stone walls pockmarked by bullets, shrapnel and artillery fire. In the quiet of an afternoon, these marks are powerful enough to conjure up in your mind the cannon blasts that created them. A section of the stone plaque commemorat ing the building's inauguration in 1807 is conspicuously absent, something memorably described by the architect Isaac Broid when he noticed the missing piece while work ing on the Centro de la Imagen (1993-1994); his testimony played a vital role in ensuring that these marks, scratches and signs of life have been preserved. 5 During his afore mentioned speech at the inauguration of the Biblioteca de México, Vasconcelos made special mention of the "gen erous agreement" between the sep and the president of the Republic, Manuel Avila Camacho, which enabled the inclusion of Antonio Casos personal library. This imme diately encouraged owners of libraries to donate them to a solvent, professionally run and serious library such as that just opened. Since then, many collections of docu ments and books have enriched the library'scollection. 87</page><page sequence="16">Already during the Vasconcelos period, the Fondo Reser vado was bolstered with the addition of the collections of Carlos Basave, Enrique Olavarría y Ferrari, and part of the library created by Joaquín Garcia Icazbalceta. And under Jaime García Terrés' directorship, Javier Icaza and Jesús Reyes Heroles' libraries were added, thus further expand ing the Fondo Reservado. Yet Vasconcelos's aspirations were only revived, with the same or greater intensity, in 2010. That year, architect Alejandro Sánchez began work adapting an area to house José Luis Martinez's library in a couple of spaces in the north-west of the building. The re sult was a success: a crisp, direct join between two spaces in an intervention that was clearly modern yet respected the historic building. Spaces were included, not just for consultation and reading, but for exhibitions and featur ing artwork by Betsabeé Romero who created a number of friendly looking model planes circling up toward the ceiling. With such a resounding triumph, the building was given a new vocation. From being a large, versatile neighborhood library, it would now hold a series of pri vate libraries built up by various iconic twentieth-century authors and bibliophiles, f To bring this idea to fruition, a master plan was drawn up by the architects Bernardo Gó mez Pimienta and Alejandro Sánchez himself. They tried but failed to dismantle the four massive umbrellas that the architect Abraham Zabludovsky had built over the court yards. They did, however, manage to make them a little more transparent. Recovering the original courtyards re quired rehabilitating the drainage system and re-leveling the floors, whose staggering was absurd. If the factory's original levels were the same as they are now, then the intervention was correct, but if the many different levels responded to adaptations done over time to ensure the buildings use, then it was mistaken. Some projects cannot be judged at the time of their completion. The truth will out in the next rainy season. Gómez Pimienta and Sán chez have made smart decisions, such as demolishing an intervention as overbearing as Zabludovsky's offices in the center of the cernidor, a space now used for a cafeteria, f The role of the inah, the federal government agency re sponsible for supervising regulations to protect buildings classified as "historic," in this case was subject to politi cal changes. Perhaps this explains why Gabriel Mérigo, the person in charge of the painstaking and professional restoration of the building, an approach that should have been taken throughout the entire intervention, even the master plan, was not allowed to continue his work. 5 An announcement has been made that, as part of the master plan, the general reference room, the children's library and the theater will all be completed or renovated by Bernardo Gómez Pimienta and Alejandro Sánchez. And the exten sion to the Centro de le Imagen will be led by architect Isaac Broid, and the office area on the side of Tresguerras and Tolsá streets will be planned by the architect Tatiana Bilbao, f The following is a list of the new or renovated li braries and spaces in La Ciudadela which have either been completed or on which work is about to begin. Antonio Castro Leal's library planned by Gómez Pimienta himself, occupies two spaces in the north part of the building. This well-crafted intervention on the old building is forceful, modern and elegant; the form of the join between the two spaces, the penetration of light directly from the skylight, the glinting reflection from the balustrades at its upper part, the indirect light that illuminates the book spines, and the palette of dark colors chosen, complementing the book bindings, defines the entire space. The architect worked together with the artist Alejandra Sermeño, who created a series of enigmatic and intriguing volumetric silhouettes in bright colors. Jaime García Terrés' library, by architect José Castillo, fits into a single space in the north-west area. This well-designed library is exceptional for how it straightforwardly houses one enclosure within another; the shelving system has been well thought out and is elegantly raised up from the floor. In this case, the architect decided to place a latticework structure to filter the light pouring in through the skylight. However, the lighting behind the bookshelves is unsatisfactory. The art ist Perla Krauze contributed to this area with a mobile that hangs from the latticework. Javier Sánchez Corral is the architect for Carlos Monsiváis's library which will occupy a floor space in the northwest area; the blueprint will be based on two principles of the original library: chaos and its owner's relationship with the city. As such it will be a space with a variety of unexpected routes, using light colors and a rug with feline motifs designed by Francisco Toledo. Finally, Ali Chumacero's library by the architect Jorge Calvillo Unna will take up two galleries in the north west area. It will include a small tree inside to mirror the one that existed in the library's original location on Gelati Street in the San Miguel Chapultepec neighborhood, as well as a sculpture by Luis Ortiz Monasterio, which was also there for many years. J Today, La Ciudadela has a more noble purpose than ever and establishes a dialogue with its history like the lines on the palm of its hand. We wish that the building may contain an infinite number of libraries (always respecting the building itself) and that the books are counted in numbers as large as the infinite stars that governor Adolfo Bassó saw as he faced the firing squad.

ENTRE LIBROS por Alfonso Reyes EL COLEGIO DE MÉXICO 88</page><page sequence="17">A CITY RESTORED Library of L IBRARIES 1 Interview with Bernardo Gómez Pimienta Magali TERCERO I n 1997,1 received a call from the poet and essayist Jai me Moreno Villarreal on behalf of the magazine Revista Biblioteca de México, asking me to interview the owners of four of the finest libraries in the country. And so, I had the pleasure of talking to José Luis Martinez, Carlos Mon siváis, Elias Trabulse and Fernando del Paso. The time I spent with each of them was very enlightening. I met with the writer and historian José Luis Martinez (1918-2007) one rainy Thursday from eight in the evening until three in the morning. His austere home was not the type of resi dence usually seen in Polanco, but rather an extraordinary library with hundreds upon hundreds of books distribut ed throughout the houses six or seven rooms. There was scarcely space left in which to live, and it was beautiful to watch the elderly scholar as he inspected the books in his Gallimard collection. Around the same period I called José Emilio Pacheco, whose library is almost mythical, and he very courteously explained that he didn't grant in terviews, but that in his house there were even books piled all over the floor, f The same description could have been applied to a house on San Simón Street, a few blocks from the Portales metro station. This was the home of Carlos Monsiváis (1937-2010), whose library will also form part of the Ciudad de los Libros, or City of Books. Visitors would enter there amid cats, books, magazines, paintings, papers and Mexican crafts. There were books on his bed, the chair, the night table and the dresser. He observed this domestic scene with a Cheshire cat grin, and like that character from Alice in Wonderland, he disappeared and reappeared in the most unexpected places. J "Look at this. There's barely room for me," boasted the chronicler whose work I had begun reading as a teenager thanks to the copy of Amor perdido we had had at my family's home. As we walked through his house, I remembered that the first interview of my professional career had been with Mon siváis in a café, and that before recording it, he had led me over to introduce me to some friends of his, Spanish exiles who owned a frame shop on Morelos Street in cen tral Mexico City. At the end of the interview that summer of 1997, he gave me a small crucifix woven out of palm leaves. I wasn't surprised because he was a self-confessed Bible-reader. That was the second of three conversations I had with Monsiváis, but it was the best one because I saw and heard wonders. Elias Trabulse (1942) received me in a study filled with antiques and incunabula from colo nial times. The novelist Fernando del Paso (1935) did not have his library in Mexico City, so we talked at a café near his apartment on the former Chilpancingo traffic circle, near Insurgentes Avenue, f That year, I learned something about the beauty of a library that is formed with passion. And I confirmed this impression last August as I explored two of the libraries that will be contained in the City of Books, currently under construction at the Biblioteca de México "José Vasconcelos" at La Ciudadela. In the first case, the José Luis Martínez Library, my guide was Miguel Bañuelos, for whom the greatest asset of Martinez's col lection is its selection of notable works from the late nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. The public will have access to Martinez's 73,500 books and periodicals on Mexican and universal literature, history and art. The sec ond library is that of Antonio Castro Leal (1896-1981), the attorney, writer and diplomat from San Luis Potosí whose collection includes works about literature and his tory, as well as music and dance. "Castro Leal's library is the great unknown," Javier Castrejón told me, "because he was a man from another century, and had the intel lectual distance of Mexican scholars of the time." J The latter collection includes about 40 000 books and nearly 10 000 documents. I interviewed the architect Bernardo Gómez-Pimienta (1960), who was commissioned not only to build Castro Leal's library, but also to collaborate with the architect Alejandro Sánchez to design a master plan for the architectural intervention of the library at La Ciudadela. Gómez-Pimienta explained that it set up a dia logue among three lexicons: contemporary elements, the restoration of Abraham Zabludovsky s architectural inter vention of the 1980s, and the recovery of the building's eighteenth-century style. LA CIUDADELA AND THE PUBLIC Honored in 1998 with the Mies van der Rohe Award for Latin American Architecture, among other international awards, Bernardo Gómez-Pimientas works include the Casa mty in San Pedro Garza García, Nuevo León, the Casa Francia n on the site of the first French Embassy in Mexico, the Aerospace Pavilion that will be built for the cfe Technology Center, and the Hotel Anticavilla in Cuernavaca, Morelos. When I ask my first question, his expression reveals some surprise: Artes de México: How will this project affect La Ciudadela's primary public—young people from junior high and high school who go there to do homework? Will the library's in tent change substantially when it is adapted to contain the personal collections of writers and book-lovers? Bernardo Gómez-Pimienta: This type of public is very important and this intervention will lead to an over all improvement [of library facilities]. La Ciudadela is given intensive use by the local population. In fact, I have a very revealing anecdote: at some point during the pro cess I was told that one student's mother was not at all convinced by the project and wanted to speak to me. I was asked to present the project to her. I agreed, and sixty parents arrived saying that they were not in agreement. One very pedantic man commented, "How can you shut down such a large building for six months? Please keep it open." I responded that we were not just giving it a paint job; there was going to be digging, trenches, dust, noise. This was just too dangerous, even for the adults. Finally, the mothers silenced this man, saying, "It will be a nui sance for the time being, but in the end it will improve all our lives. Let them do their job." And that's the truth. Local residents make a lot of use out of this space which will be a library of libraries. Blind people come here, and people who come to read the want ads in newspapers; people who work around the metro station [Balderas] come to tour the building: the street vendors hawking pirated videos, and the couples dancing danzón in the square. In the general reference section, people from the neighborhood will be able to work on assignments or read Octavio Paz. 89 Bernardo Gómez Pimienta Magali TERCERO</page><page sequence="18">AM: Will the City of Books truly become the "great cul tural achievement of the twenty-first century," as Carlos Monsiváis told Consuelo Sáizar, the director of the Na tional Council for the Arts [Conaculta] when the project was still in the making? BGP: "Monsi" was entirely correct. The project has many positive aspects. We're restoring the courtyards as court yards. We're salvaging an abandoned building from the eighteenth century, and that in itself is wonderful, but we're also salvaging the intervention that Zabludovsky did in the 1980s. His domes were blocked off after twenty five years, and we're going to return to his original vision. The third goal—acquiring a number of private book col lections—is fundamental. Just to achieve that is already sensational. We're going to include five libraries at La Ciu dadela, one next to the other. This is great for researchers. The entire collection is being digitalized to make it more accessible to the public. AM: What did the groundwork for the renovation's mas ter plan entail? BGP: Given that the building occupies a three-hectare area, several aspects were taken into consideration. First, we needed to get a good understanding of the building's various functions and then programmatically reorganize those different functions. Secondly, we had to restore the north-south and perimetral flows, because the building was divided and there was no means of access between the different sections. There was no way to pass from one courtyard to another, and we exposed them all so we could understand not only the movement among the different spaces but also how they worked together. The building sometimes flooded and it was a mess. Both the interior plumbing and the sewer systems of the entire zone were full of mud and garbage. 5 We discovered a sewer along Enrico Martinez. It's a pipe two meters in diameter that dates back to the Porfirio Díaz era, and over half of its diameter was completely clogged. Also, the street vendors by the Metrobús had poured grease and cement into it. We couldn't unblock it in short sections, so we had to dredge five kilometers of the sewer system. The public bathrooms were almost the only ones within a five-kilometer area. As for the electricity, the residents had installed their own haphazard electrical connections to the grid. It was a miracle the building hadn't exploded. We used low consumption lights and installed wireless Internet. Then we presented a proposal for digital intercommunication. The infrastructure was extremely important: cleaning up patchwork repairs, redoing finishes, as part of an overall project where the floor levels were staggered. We've re moved any material that didn't form part of the original structure and we're recoating the entire building. All this is a way of eliminating obstacles. Any one of us could have tripped and fallen with so many ramps around. BRAILLE AND AUDIO FOR THE BLIND Gómez-Pimienta also spoke of the new volcanic stone floor that is a common element among the spaces and thus provides unity. A few days after the interview, I no ticed some grooves at the exit from the José Luis Martinez Library, designed to guide the canes of blind visitors, as well as tactile signs that can be read with a cane. This sec tion will contain not only books in Braille but also audio books, given that Braille writing tends to wear down. The entire building contains tactile indicators for the visually impaired. The space, which measures 170 square meters, has aged well despite subsidence along a sixty-meter span, though this is not detectable by the human eye. As my interlocutor added, "You realize it floods because water has the bad habit of spreading horizontally. The building was first erected outside city limits, and its walls are two meters thick, except at the top where they are one meter thick." AM: How are you planning to distribute areas other than the bibliographic collections, such as bookstores, the chil dren's library, the theater and so forth? por JUAN JOSE ARREOLA letras mexicanas FONDO DE CULTURA ECONOMICA BGP: We're locating other facilities near the north en trance. There will be two bookstores there: an Educal store for adults and one for children. There used to be a small theater, which has now been moved to one corner so people can access it from inside the building and leave through an independent exit at the end of the show. It con tains an artwork by Dr. Lakra. The seats are on movable tiers to accommodate different forms of staging. There will be dressing and rehearsal rooms, and a grid over the stage to allow for the safe mounting of stage sets. J The children's bookstore will have an independent entrance from Enrico Martinez Street. I should point out that this is not a daycare but rather a bookstore where parents can accompany their children to help them acquire a taste for reading through the use of new technology. We're open ing up more courtyards as play areas for children. We've invited the artist Magali Lara to contribute a piece. She remarked that children are always looking at the ground, 90</page><page sequence="19">so that's where her artwork will be. We've created exhi bition galleries and computer rooms with about seventy computers that are available to the public. One courtyard is being adapted as a reading area: people can borrow books and read them right there. Each of the four main courtyards has a unique function, such as the writers' patio, which will be used for book launches and lectures. Another courtyard will house the newspaper library of the Fondo Reservado [the collection of the library's most important documents] and will also be used to screen movies in the evenings. The fourth courtyard is for library employees. By connecting the building's different areas, fewer employees will be needed. AM: You were also talking about the building's geographi cal center... BGP: We've refurbished the tobacco shredder at the middle of the building, and now it acts as a geographical center. In order to restore the walls, we had to demolish the roofs that had been added to the courtyards over the years. We also wanted to let in more light and create a microclimate. Isaac Broid, who was in charge of the in tervention done at the Centro de la Imagen in the 1990s, is working there again: the idea is to connect that museum with the City of Books. The design of the whole building is meant to be environmentally sustainable and use very lit tle energy. We studied how the foundations were built and found that some of the crawl spaces were flooded, right at Balderas where there used to be an irrigation ditch. So we have water there, while the area along Enrico Martinez is dryer. This is the first time that an eighteenth-century building has been adapted to twenty-first-century envi ronmental parameters. We're also redoing the facades. The exterior coating was removed at some point, and the walls began absorbing a lot of moisture. We've redone the exterior finish with quicklime and prickly pear sap, just like in the eighteenth century. The facade will be red. The exterior landscaping is being redone. There were dead or dying trees, shrubs and plants, and the roots of healthy trees adjacent to the building were accelerating its de terioration. All the bathrooms were concentrated at the north entrance, so now we're splitting them up. There are several core groupings to make everything much more ef ficient so people don't have to cross the whole building. We're employing virtually indestructible materials, given that the spaces will be very high-traffic areas. Everything is above standard, and that's important. Finally, there are plans to include a coffee shop. GALLERIES FOR FIFTY THOUSAND BOOKS AM: You were in charge of the Antonio Castro Leal Li brary, which opened last March. BGP: That's right. Alejandro Sánchez had the José Luis Martinez Library and I had the Castro Leal Library. Some of the libraries are reference rooms with one or two gal leries. They all feature a work of art, and the general ref erence section features four galleries and four artworks. The Castro Leal Library has two galleries holding about 50,000 books. I had the great fortune to visit Castro Leal's home in Coyoacán. I visited it with his daughter Marcia. And there I saw the bookcases—which were empty by then—made of dark brown wood, lining all the walls from floor to ceiling. I revisited those two elements, but in the galleries of La Ciudadela, their structural order was tied to the Catalan vault which features metal joists every me ter and a half. The first step was to understand that struc tural rhythm. So the joists provided us with the library's basic order. We couldn't touch the original walls. Separate from the walls, the library has a concealed metal struc ture. Bookcases measuring nearly three meters wide ex tend across every two vault segments, f Behind all this we installed ventilation and electrical wiring so they would be hidden from view. There is a kilometer of shelves to hold 50,000 volumes, and each shelf has a light to make the spines of the books the focal point of the library. Each book spine is illuminated so it glows, so to speak. We wanted it all to be as bright as possible, because the floor is light-colored wood and the glass and leather furniture is white. There are four main spaces. The first is where the library employees work, ensuring that no books are stolen and so forth. Then we have an area where people can work in groups of three or four, as well as long tables for indi vidual researchers. In the fourth area, there are couches with low tables so people can work in a more casual fash ion. We were fortunate to be able to design couches and tables in different sizes because that's something else we do at our office. This gives you a very interesting perspec tive: it begins with the object you touch and then contin ues with the place where you work. It's a comprehensive approach. J When I visited the library, Javier Castrejón showed me the dual play of lights that allows you to see the bookshelves in different ways. Since the books are go ing to be digitized, there will be very little need to consult them directly. I'm not sure I like that, but it guarantees the safety of each volume. In the section containing books with dedications, he showed me one that Juan José Arreóla had signed: "For Don Antonio Castro Leal, a reader to whom I am indebted. Juan José Arreóla. November 14,1952." AM: To conclude, Bernardo: what was the main challenge in creating the Antonio Castro Leal Library? BGM: One of the many complications that arise, especial ly with old buildings, is that even though we have blue prints, every time we dig, we find foundations we didn't know existed. So we've had to make many adaptations to the project. Restoration means to do well by a building, to understand it. And that takes a long time, f Gómez Pimienta grows more animated as he speaks: "We control the humidity. We were able to get rid of the labels because we're going to use a digital reader, and the books are much cleaner. We've organized them the same way Castro Leal did; in other words, by country: France, Spain, England and others, because he was a diplomat. There are also per sonal objects such as diplomas and awards, so people will know who the owner of that library was. He was the dean of the National Autonomous University of Mexico at the age of thirty-one, he founded the Faculty of Economy, and then he was the director of the Fine Arts Institute. To gether with other figures, he established the group known as the Siete Sabios [Seven Scholars], which gave rise to the Ateneo. It was very important to collaborate with him in some manner to create a library in the style of the twenty first century." f And this appears to have been the case: it was necessary to understand who Castro Leal was in order to transpose the spirit of his library to the City of Books. * Translated by Michelle Suderman. 9i</page><page sequence="20">A POSSIBLE CITY The Cloud Bookcase $ Eliot WEINBERGER S Absorption of Solar and Lunar Essences by Anonymous (fourth century) Alchemy of the Purple Coil by Anonymous (twelfth century) A treatise on sexuality.

CITY OF ART Santiago ESPINOSA DE LOS MONTEROS F or centuries, libraries have been the personal temples of the people who created them. They contain events, oc currences, profound thoughts and connections that hark back to the time when they were created. Everything about libraries seems designed to form an army of com batants against amnesia who, at the slightest provocation, hurl in our faces the very words we were about to forget. Thus, libraries act as arsenals of words placed alongside one another until they number in the millions. And all this in the personal spaces of the strategists of thought who assembled them, f Patiently, one by one, Antonio Castro Leal, Jaime García Terrés, Carlos Monsiváis, José Luis Martínez and Alí Chumacero added the different books they had appropriated to their personal libraries. The explosive charge of each of these books was tempo rarily neutralized inside their homes. Now, those volumes have been given a new home that will allow each library to remain intact, but also connected to the collections amassed by four other remarkable personalities, f Contemporary works of art have been pro duced for each of the five libraries that now form part of the Ciudad de los Libros or City of Books. These pieces are parallel cre ations rather than illustra tions of the different libraries. And far from using predictable narratives to address the monumental task that was the formation of these collec tions, the works of art created ex profeso for these newly constructed spaces tend to rely on quotation, f For in stance, for the José Luis Martinez Library, Betsabeé Romero fashioned eighteen airplanes flying in spirals overhead. On their "fuselage" are the names of some of the authors represented in the library, such as Gabriel García Márquez, Pablo Neruda, José Martí and Marcel Proust. Beneath the airplanes' wings, in strangely dynam ic stillness, we read the titles of great works such as Cosmic Canticle (Ernesto Cardenal), Our America (José Martí), The Prisoner (Marcel Proust) and Where the Air is Clear (Carlos Fuentes), among many others, f Their only visible cargo is a bundle of books hanging on a kind of swing from each tin sculpture, as if they were about to be dropped like emergency rations into zones suffering from a literary famine. None of the bundles have been let loose yet—perhaps this is not the chosen spot, f Hanging from the ceiling of the Jaime García Terrés Library we find Per la Krauzes work Suspended Time. An artist with a well established body of work, here she presents a shower of stones made from subtly colored resins which, despite their weight, fall gently upon the library's reading area. Although there are no beams of light trained directly on them, their translucent appearance lends them a delicate brilliance that brings to mind a space of tranquility, f They are all different sizes and colors, and are placed ran domly to show either their edges or their front. Krauze thus successfully links her piece to the books whose sizes and covers also make up a catalogue of diversities. We are alerted to the work's presence by a gentle spinning move ment as the air is stirred by a visitor walking by or turning the pages of a book, f Three pieces make up Alejandra Zermeño's Three Methods of Creation: Observation, Reflec tion and Projection. These life-size anthropomorphic fig ures welcome us to different areas of the Antonio Castro Leal Library. One of them, Observation, in red and stand ing near the railing of a bridge, watches us with all its in evitable corpulence. *, In another area, the figure of a young man in blue kneels on the ground while lovingly holding his arms around his torso as if embracing himself. This is Reflection. Finally, a slender young woman in pink projects herself upward while at the same time decon structing herself to give way to the creative act; she repre sents Projection, f The children's section is one of the key areas in the City of Books. Magali Lara was the artist in vited to participate here, and she generated a large corpus of pieces whose dimensions and references to childhood combine to create a welcoming environment with flashes of the colors that marked her early years, f The carpet fea tures the blues and golds that inhabit her memories of the Blue Mosque in Istanbul, which had a profound influence on her. Other drawings conceived in tones of gray and black will adorn the walls, and though they are mostly symmetrical in nature, they are designed to generate mo ments of relaxation in the manner of a mandala. J Laure ana Toledo and Minerva Cuevas share the space of the reserves collection. With her piece Rearview, Toledo breaks through the inner/outer barrier by using images projected from inside the library into the gardens and vice versa. Inside, real-time images of the gardens are project ed onto the books. Another projector in the gardens al lows those on the outside to observe people consulting the books within the library. 5 Minerva Cuevas carries out a direct intervention on the reserves collection shelves with her pieces Victory Series and Tragic Series. These make di rect and precise reference to the emblematic building of La Ciudadela, whose presence is felt in the bronze cast ings that she fabricated for the piece. They act as book ends like the ones often seen in home libraries, and which have taken many different forms over past eras. J Vicente Rojo is a visual artist from the generation known as La Ruptura, and his career has been closely linked to the world of publishing. Large Primitive Scene is a painting that contains the evocations of the famed graphic design er who determined the appearance of countless books and periodicals in Mexico and around the world. 5 In this piece, chromatically repetitive elements emulate the slight differences between the different bookcases, drawing our attention to the signs guiding us to the volume we seek. Sixty paintings make up a single large canvas, and no two sections are alike. They vary in the solution proposed but share a similar structure and form, complemented by its opposite. 5 The Carlos Monsiváis Library contains a work by the chronicler's close friend, Francisco Toledo. This is one of the most playful and uninhibited works of art in the City of Books. This textile recreates bookshelves that hold volumes arranged without any apparent order. Some bear titles: Monsiváis's books El estado laico y sus malque rientes and Apocalipstick, the Bible, of course, and next to it, Puss in Boots. These are some of the books that Toledo thought belonged in Monsiváis's library. 5 To the right of this piece we see a life-size silhouette of "Monsi" walking toward the left, where one of his many cats awaits him alongside the inevitable figure of a Mexican wrestler. In this evocative work, this great chronicler's dynamic and 94 Santiago ESPINOSA DE LOS MONTEROS y View of the Antonio Castro Leal Library, designed by Bernardo Gómez Pimienta.</page><page sequence="23">most accurate representations of folk culture become hi eratic presences that have become frozen in place (not without a healthy dose of humor). 5 One of the most am bitious pieces in Dr. Lakra's body of work is on display at the City of Books. Made up of seven panels, the mural in the theater alludes to the bibliographic references which have marked this artists life: the fantastic monsters of Abraham Ortelius's atlas, the cover of Aurelio Baldor's Al gebra, scenes from Oriental tales and Mexican cinema, and important cultural figures with deformed faces. After the fashion of many colonial altarpieces, Dr. Lakra has in cluded a medallion bearing the date the piece was created and the first names of his assistants. Completing the com position, we see some men fighting to the death against an enraged whale while a female silhouette dances on a hill top: what remains in the end is the enjoyment and cele bration of images. J The inclusion of works of visual art in a space devoted to bibliographic activities establishes an enriching and fruitful dialogue. By avoiding the use of the obligatory literary quotations and the predictable parade of great authors, each work has established its own ap proach. And to our benefit, they now meet in this space as a clear contribution to the encounter of disciplines. Critique: It is one of the most complete buildings of its period and is in the so-called Neoclassic style, but unlike other buildings in this same style it is joyful and graceful. There are limited examples of this style, and therefore preserving it is of great interest. There have been several attempts to destroy it and only its good luck has managed to save it from ruin. Thus Marroquí tells us "a thousand projects have been conceived for this building, for it seems that our people and our Government are bothered by good things, and until now it has been spared more or less complete transformations and even saved from total demolition, still standing and destined to be a weapons factory."
