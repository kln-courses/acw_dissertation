Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2013, xxxv + 654 pp., $45.00 (hb) In a recently discovered 1960 lecture, given at the University of Chicago Hillel House entitled "Introduction to Maimonides' The Guide of the Perplexed," Leo Strauss states that an awareness of the political horizon in which Maimonides lived, thought, and wrote "compels us to make an entirely new beginning, which is in fact identical with Maimonides' own beginning. That beginning consists in not taking philosophy for granted.. .Philosophy must be understood as in need of justifying itself before a higher or a prephilosophical tribunal" (Leo Strauss on Maimonides, hereafter: M, p. 434). If Maimonides allows readers a new beginning with respect to an understanding of philosophy, and if Strauss allows readers a similarly new beginning concerning Maimonides' thought, then surely Kenneth Hart Green's two impressive new volumes allow readers an analogous beginning concerning the thought of Leo Strauss as it pertains to the question of revealed Law and reason—or, as Strauss put it, "Jerusalem and Athens." Does this comparison place too much importance, or too heavy a burden, on Green's work? I believe it does not, and this for the following reason: From his early Jew and Philosopher: The Return to Maimonides in the Jewish Thought of Leo Strauss (SUNY Press, 1993) to his two new volumes, Green has argued in sustained fashion for the central importance of Maimonides to the thought of Strauss.

Instead, revealed Law and reason enact a continuous dialectical tension that, while sometimes resulting in violence, also gave rise to Western civiliza tion. Figures like Maimonides and Strauss are interesting insofar as they provide a lens through which to view these two poles of the West. They are also interesting insofar as they show how the two poles can (in the words of Leora Batnitzky) be coordinated. This becomes especially important given the recent publication of Strauss's correspon dence in which readers encounter enigmatic statements to the effect that Maimonides was not a Jew in his belief (Leo Strauss and the Rediscovery of Maimonides, hereafter: RM, p. 108). Rather than take this simply as evidence of Strauss's atheism, Green inter prets it as an instance of the aforementioned dialectic: "It is obvious from everything we know about Maimonides that he was evidently a Jew in the beliefs which, enacted as law, he definitely himself followed, and indeed which he 'legislated,' or rather reit erated and organized, as law code. But he chose to follow them because he had reasons to so choose. Those reasons relate to the fact that the truth did not always reside in the beliefs; instead, this truth may rather reside in the function which those beliefs performed. This is to say, they serve a true or necessary purpose of sustaining Jewish life and its specific teachings, just as one may apply those same moral and religious truths to human life or traditions in general. Hence it is no surprise that although Mai monides defended Jewish law and even Jewish dogma, reason is always to be followed first, as Strauss reminds his readers, if reason teaches a truth that is genuinely known, whatever may appear to have been commanded by law, and even while what has been commanded is still binding" (RM, p. 108). Differently stated, Strauss is correct in holding that Maimonides adherence to Jewish law and dogma is not passive, let alone slavish, but rather the result of a political-philosophical enterprise. The political, thus, forms the horizon for the dialogue between 'Jerusalem' and 'Athens.' Maimonides is the only figure about which Strauss wrote from the beginning of his philosophical career to the very end. Strauss, over time, altered not only his views about Maimonides but also the way he presented those views. His early writings seem to present Maimonides as a genuine follower of "speculative theology" (kalam) while his middle and later writings (after the re-orientation towards political philosophy and the need to "write between the lines" in the 1930s) present Maimonides—in differing degrees of explicitness—as a medieval political philosopher in the tradition of al Farabi and Averröes. These later writings can be especially rough going for students of Strauss and Maimonides insofar as Strauss covers massive tracts of historical, philosophical and theological land without providing many clear road maps. One of the signal virtues of Leo Strauss on Maimonides: The Complete Writings is the astoundingly voluminous scholarly apparatus that Green has placed in the notes (e.g., M: 556n 11 and M: 559nl9). For the first time, readers have access to bibliographic references to, and translations of, texts only alluded to, or mentioned in passing, by Strauss, including scriptural texts, but also those of Joseph Albo, Isaac Abravanel, al-Farabi, Ibn Tibbon, Sa'adiya Gaon, to name only a few. Further, in the two new pieces (a recent translation of Strauss's 1931 lecture "Cohen and Maimonides" as well as the 1960 Hillel House lecture on Maimonides), the editorial apparatus reaches the â Springer</page><page sequence="3">Int J Philos Relig (2014) 75:73-76 75 level of a critical edition. In short, these two books establish, beyond any doubt, the importance of Maimonides for Strauss's thought. Where Leo Strauss on Maimonides is marked by its systematic completeness (as much as, in any event, can reasonably be expected from one volume), Leo Strauss and the Rediscovery of Maimonides gives a more spacious and open-ended presen tation of the Strauss-Maimonides relation; as a companion volume, it surveys the forest in which the trees presented in the former volume reside. This does not at all mean that the volume lacks a scholarly approach—in his introduction, Green has pro vided readers with a detailed listing of the published correspondence relevant for an understanding of Strauss's relation to Maimonides (RM, p. 180nl7). Rather, Green's companion study also exemplifies the break with a reductively historicist approach that, for Green, is one of the hallmarks of Strauss's thought (in the form of what Seth Benardete once called "transhistorical history of philosophy")—that is, he (1) dis plays thematic kinships between Strauss and seemingly unlikely figures such as Hegel concerning the relation of history to "the literary" (RM, p. 113) and Kierkegaard con cerning the "literary guises" of authors (RM, p. 32), (2) provides glimpses into depth of the historical transmission of Maimonides, e.g., through figures as diverse as Petrus Cunaeus, Grotius, Leibniz, Lessing, and Maimon (RM, p. 151) as well as (3) argues in favor of the view expressed by Strauss that Maimonides' Guide was in fact a Jewish book dealing with philosophy by means of a contrast with a contemporary, the Jewish poet/philosopher Ibn Gabirol, who chose to write about philosophy in a non-Jewish manner (RM, pp. 34-35). Perhaps most significantly, Green shows how, on Strauss's account, Maimonides the thinker can "make sense" of his own activity as a thinker in a way that figures constricted by the determinist assumptions of modern historicism cannot: "[in a modern context] a bold thinker arises who invents an original system of thought, often to improve the human situation, but who is unable to explain him self on the basis of his own thought in his activity as a thinker. Thus, for the typical modern thinker this determinism that recurs in most modern systems reveals a fatal if unwitting flaw of blindness about what it might seem to imply about human nature if man is undoubtedly a thinking being" (RM, p. 9). Differently stated, if human nature is not simply reducible to historical context, the originality of thought can be premised on human freedom. It is this intellectual freedom that, above all else, characterizes Strauss's Maimonides and Green's Strauss. The only question I would raise with respect to Green's account of Strauss—and this signals perhaps more a difference of emphasis than substance—concerns his (to my mind) most daring and provocative statement. Green closes his editorial introduction as follows: Let me conclude with a religious thought which is not entirely foreign to either "the great eagle" or to the modern scholar who perhaps most closely watched him in flight. The Messiah is the hope—proclaimed as not unreasonable by Mai monides, and as a matter eminently worthy of serious consideration by Strauss— that some day this harmony may be fully achieved, while not doing away with the very fundamental tension which both acknowledged for so long as history is not yet completely redeemed. If pursued together in actuality, i.e., Maimonides' hope and Strauss's consideration, they promise something—through the very Springer</page><page sequence="4">76 Int J Philos Relig (2014) 75:73-76 struggle rather than by the fulfillment alone—that enriches human life and that, strengthened by the common search for the one truth, brings it ever closer to this noble goal (M, p. 87). What makes this passage daring and provocative is its suggestion that Strauss con siders both (1) a rationalist form of Jewish messianism and (2) the "tensed harmony" of Jerusalem and Athens to be possible. This suggestion will surely frustrate Straus sians of the extreme "East Coast" persuasion. My question is somewhat different. It is certainly the case that Strauss views Jerusalem and Athens to be both fundamen tal related to one another and necessarily so. It is also true that Strauss affirms the value of both Jerusalem and Athens (although, on my reading, his own relation to Judaism seems to have occurred just over the "border" in the periphery of Athens). I wonder, however, if Strauss's intellectual career isn't also—and in an equally explicit manner-—an account of the limits of both Jerusalem and Athens. This view is given its most precise articulation in his "Restatement on Xenophon's Hiero (contained in What is Political Philosophy? And Other Studies [University Of Chicago Press, 1988]). In that essay, Strauss both draws a connection between the philosopher's extreme detachment from the everyday world (p. 122) with that of the tyrant on the one hand as well as diagnoses the problem of sectarianism—which problem equally affects philosophy and religion—as the overwhelming of fundamental questions by one's "subjective certainty" on the other. Put differently, Strauss can be understood as articulating both the limits of philosophical knowledge and of faith-based certainty. This acknowledgment of limits is certainly in keeping with Maimonides' Guide, the entire first book of which is an explication of the equivocal character of scriptural terms dealing with the divine. In this respect, one might speak of Strauss's project as adhering to the Maimonidean construal of the ban on images as a critique of anthro pomorphic representation of the divine. Insofar as Strauss construes both Jerusalem and Athens as responses to the "theological-political problem" concerning the most just polity or society, this construal of the ban on images/anthropomorphism assumes the character of a critique of political idolatry—i.e., neither Jerusalem nor Athens can achieve the best polity or society when they are allowed to reign unchecked. If my reading is correct, then this aspect of Strauss's thought can be said to exhibit a (perhaps paradoxical) kinship with the thought of another Weimar Jewish émigré— Theodor Adorno. Writing about the activity of philosophy "after Auschwitz," Adorno construes the ban on images first and foremost as both a theoretical and practical limi tation on the attempt to determine the complexity of human being, understood socially or otherwise. While his language and approach differs vastly from Adorno's, I believe that it is not incorrect to understand Strauss's manifold references to the "mystery of being" as gesturing toward the same dangers of "tyrannical" rationality and unguided "sectarianism." I believe that the picture of Strauss and his Maimonides, illustrated by Green's work, certainly accords a space for the issue of these limits. The ultimate question is whether Strauss's thought manifests the hope that Green suggests. That these two exciting volumes help raise, without prematurely answering, this fundamental question shows that Green's project is faithful to Strauss's profound insights into philosophy as a way of life.
