<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM JAMES ON OVERBELIEFS' AND LIVE OPTIONS' JOHN H. WHITTAKER IntJPhilRel 14: 203-216 (1983). Â©1983 Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, The Hague. Printed in the Netherlands. Louisiana State University What William James said of other philosophies is particularly true of his own: it expresses the moral character of its author and it sanctions his deepest sentiments about life. That is why some of James's readers are so unsympathetic in their judg- ment of his work; they lack the moral and religious impulses which his pragmatism enshrines. Others are more forgiving; they share these impulses and feel at home in the attempt to rationalize them. Perhaps I should say at the ouset, therefore, that I am a sympathizer. I would not want to shield his philosophy from criticism, but in re-examining James's thinking I would rather err on the side of generosity. In James's recurrent discussions of reason and faith, for example, one finds more than enough to question. When he suggests that religious beliefs might be self- certifying, or that "faith in a fact can help [to] create that fact," then one must object.1 That line of defense threatens to dissolve the cognitive significance of re- ligious claims in a bath of relativism. Yet when James simply describes faith claims and the kind of judgment which they require, then one can admire his insight. Religious teachings, he says, are really 'overbeliefs.; and their credibility depends on the 'electric connection' which they make with our needs and sensibilities. Only those beliefs which elicit our passions come alive, and only 'living options' inspire faith. There is wisdom as well as charm in these appealing phrases, but little clarity. James never elaborated the insights which lay behind their use, and subsequent philosophers have never bothered to make up the lack. So whatever philosophical insights lay in the use of such terms have yet to be developed. I James did not invent the term 'overblief.' He borrowed it from Matthew Arnold,2 who in turn had borrowed it from Goethe.3 Indeed, the term Aberglaube has a long history; and like other such terms, its meaning has varied. By Aberglauben Goethe apparently meant little more than superstitions. But when Arnold adopted the term, he left behind its pejorative connotations. A berglauben - or 'extra-beliefs,' as 203</page><page sequence="2">204 he called them - can degenerate into superstitions, but only when they are mis- understood. These beliefs originate as poetic expressions designed to convey some sense of 'the eternal not ourselves.' Their meaning resides in the workings of imagi- nation, not in arbitrary imaginings but in a higher poetry evoked by deeply stirring religious experiences. Yet what comes forth from experience and imagination as poetry hardens into dogma when it is taken over by people who lack the religious feelings which it reflects. Then extra -beliefs, being misconstrued as metaphysical language, produce the 'popular science' of supernatural theism.4 When James adopted the term (preferring to translate it as 'overblief ), he too tried to rid it of negative overtones. Yet he did so in a quite different way. He was more interested in philosophical ideas than in poetic effusions, and so he expanded his use of the term to include beliefs which were the product of the intellect as well as the imagination. But more importantly, he viewed overbeliefs in thoroughly practical terms. Overbeliefs, he said, 'build out' a person's religious thoughts in ways congruent with his vital needs.5 Whatever their source in intellect or imagination may be, such beliefs maintain themselves in the conduct of life. They are the means by which the intimations of experience are transmuted into an articulate faith and discharged in activity. They enable a person to live, to make use of his experience in the pursuit of a meaningful existence. No one who seeks a spiritual life can do without them. Indeed, the ideas which arouse spiritual excitement in an individual are "essential to that individual's religion; - which is as much as to say that over- beliefs in various directions are absolutely indispensable, and that we should treat them with tenderness and tolerance so long as they are not intolerant themselves."6 The difference between James and Arnold on this point may seem slight; James puts a greater stress on overbeliefs and conduct while Arnold speaks of extra- beliefs and experience. But this difference belies a deeper concern for the reason- ableness of faith claims on James's part, and it prefaces his account of their justi- fication. He did not believe that the 'deliverances of direct religious experience' could ever be confirmed, either by the experience itself or by abstract reflection.7 For the appeal to experience in defense of religious claims always takes one in a circle. The significance which one derives from an experience depends on the be- liefs through which it is understood; and if this understanding is to be shared, the beliefs which provide it must also be shared. Thus, the resort to religiously defined experiences always begs the question of their proper interpretation. James knew this, and his use of the term 'overbelief reflected the difficulty. Overbeliefs reach beyond the bounds of mere description and carry the believer over into the un- certain realm of interpretation. For that reason, they also overstep the limits of fully adjudicable arguments. No independent evidence can be found to settle the question of their truth or falsity. They require another kind of justification. That other kind of justification, of course, is pragmatic. Yet there would be no need for a pragmatic rationale here if there were not a class of beliefs which exceed the range of all other means of adjudication. The members of this class include not only religious beliefs but evaluative claims of every sort, inasmuch as they all go beyond verifiable matters of natural fact. The logical positivists thought that such</page><page sequence="3">205 claims needed no justification, since they were not proper assertions to begin with. But James thought that they were of central importance in human life, and his entire philosophical output revolved in greater or lesser circles about them. For the matters with which overbeliefs deal are inescapable questions about the good- ness and the value and the meaning of our lives. Such questions determine the dis- position of our lives by bringing our thoughts and activities under some over- riding conception of how things stand in human life cosmically conceived, and of what, if anything, makes life worth living. When these questions are raised, the evidence which we gather in other fields of inquiry loses its logical power to guide us, leaving us without objectively telling means of judgment. Yet to live one needs to address such concerns. One has to find some perspective in which a lifetime's experience can be evaluatively understood and practically managed. That, once again, is where overbeliefs come in. In building out the range of our judgments beyond the limits of scientific inquiry, overbeliefs build in the practical implications which do not reside in lesser beliefs. They introduce the concepts need- ed to encompass one's experience is a teleological perspective, thereby giving the be- liever's thinking a dispositional component. Overbeliefs, in other words, function as truths to live by; and this gives them their peculiarly practical rationale. Or at least, it opens them to the possibility of a practical justification. For being advanced as truths to live by, overbeliefs must be tested in the same way - by living by them. Much of James's pragmatic theory of truth is designed to show that this kind of practical testing is not as suspect as it seems. Any good hypothesis, he says, must bear implications beyond the immediate phenomena which it is meant to explain; and this is just as true of religious hypotheses as it is of any other. Hypotheses must represent the world in ways which force new expectations and practical adjust- ments on those who believe in them. Otherwise, the question of their truth or falsity will collapse into an unmanageable muddle, for they will be both pointless and untestable. Thus, if it takes overbeliefs to yield the necessary practical implica- tions in relation to our spiritual concerns, one need not worry over the impossi- bility of justifying these beliefs on scientific grounds. The practical expectations which they dictate are of a different sort than those of science. They have another kind of value, and to that extent another kind of verification. If they prove to be existentially, or spiritually capacitating, that is reason enough for them to be maintained.8 In any case, overbeliefs are neither superstitions nor poetic effusions, since their credibility depends more on the conduct which follows from them than on the ex- periences or fears which underlie them. This much seems clear. Yet the logical details of James's account are still far from clear. When he suggests that overbe- liefs help to maintain a state of faith as an active disposition, one wonders if over- beliefs have anything more than a psychological role to play in shaping religious attitudes and in motivating religious behavior. One wonders, that is, whether over- beliefs need to be truth claims at all. Perhaps they need not have any cognitive function to serve as truths to live by. This last question is made all the more urgent by the disturbing similarity</page><page sequence="4">206 which James's discussion of overbeliefs bears to R.B. Braithwaite's treatment of religious claims. According to Braithwaite's well-known view, religious teachings serve as psychological aids in reinforcing primary moral and conative dispositions.9 The figurative language and story-like features of these teachings strength the be- liever's intentions by fixing in his mind the practical point of his faith. Braithwaite even draws on James's own source, Matthew Arnold, to illustrate the point. By picturing God as a magnified and improved 'Lord Shaftsbury,' and by picturing Jesus as a younger Lord Shaftsbury who dies for the sake of those who have of- fended his father, Christians may find it easier to understand and to pursue an un- selfish life.10 But this has nothing to do with the truth or falsity of such a picture, or even with the picture being used to portray a possible truth. The intention to lead an unselfish life constitutes the essence of faith here, while the pictorial over- beliefs used to express this faith simply aid in the fulfillment of this intention. And given this as the only function of overbeliefs, their justification depends en- tirely on their effectiveness in promoting an active life of faith. Their value has no relation to their truth or falsity, since they might play effective psychological roles without having any cognitive significance at all. They might be pure poetry, so to speak - as long as believers find them useful in the conduct of the life which they intend. James's emphasis on the practical side of religious belief, like Braithwaite's, leads directly to pragmatic appeals in their defense. Yet it is quite clear from other things which James says that he would not have shared Braithwaite's non-cognitive analysis of religious assertions. A religion of overbeliefs is not only a psychological affair of attitude and conduct but a "postulator of new facts as well. The world interpreted religiously is not the materialistic world over again with an altered ex- pression; it must have, over and above the altered expression, a natural constitu- tion different at some point from that which a materialistic world would have."11 The difficulty, of course, is to see how overbeliefs could postulate new facts without being subject to the same canons of judgment which govern scientific claims, or 'underbeliefs.' In one sense, overbeliefs must go beyond matters of natural fact in order to institute judgments of value and cosmic purpose, but in another sense they cannot go beyond all matters of fact without losing their con- nection with truth and falsity. They must represent the world in such a way that the peculiar facts which they posit entail some teleological implications for our existence. And these facts must not belong to any ordinary means of scientific discovery or empirical confirmation. They must belong to a higher order to truths, so that the would-be believer must overstep the bounds of all other factual inquiries to arrive at them. This, I think, comes as close as one can get to James's concep- tion of overbeliefs. The question is: can his view withstand a cognitive analysis? II This issue at stake here is still the justification of religious claims, for the plausi-</page><page sequence="5">207 bility of James's pragmatism depends on the logical status assigned to the beliefs in question. If they have no cognitive significance, then appeals to their utility should be unobjectionable. But if they are genuine truth claims, as James insists, then their pragmatic defense is bound to provoke complaints. Useful beliefs can turn out to be false. Can overbeliefs, though, turn out to be false? Having proved themselves as truths to live by, could they ever be falsified? Again, it depends on what one means by 'overbeliefs.' If these beliefs require pragmatic rationales because of a circum- stantial lack of evidence, the logical possibility that they might be overturned by new evidence cannot be discounted. As long as independent evidence of some kind is appropriate and pragmatic considerations arise only in default of that evidence, the practical value of a belief can never testify to its truth. It can only excuse 3. believer for maintaining a useful belief in the absence of rational grounds. If the pragmatic justification of overbeliefs is to make any sense, therefore, these beliefs must not overreach the available evidence by accident. They must by their very nature overreach the telling power of all independently gathered evidence. Of course, if they are truth claims to begin with, they must be open to the logical possibility of being false. But they need not be demonstratively true or false, either by empirical means or by another other means; for there is no rule of logic which requires every truth claim to be demonstrable. To be appropriately governed by considerations of utility, overbeliefs must be truth claims of an entire- ly different, indemonstrable sort. At this level of analysis, however, James offers no help. He does say that 'our passional nature' should not be allowed to decide a question of truth and falsity unless that question is irresolvable on intellectual grounds.12 Yet he doesn't explain what it is about faith claims, or overbeliefs in general, which makes them so imper- vious to objective adjudication. Nor does he explain how pragmatic considerations could Verify' religious beliefs without providing telling evidence after all. Perhaps he thought that pragmatic 'evidence' was objective in the sense of providing war- ranted inferences about the truth or falsity of the beliefs in question, but subjec- tive in the sense that a believer has to make a personal commitment of faith to get at this evidence. On the near side of a leap of faith, such evidence might not be available; but on the far side, the man who acts in accordance with faith might dis- cover the evidence which he needs to justify it. But then, what would prevent this evidence from being made public? None of these difficulties would matter if James had been willing to accept a non-cognitivist account of overbeliefs. If he had not insisted on there being reli- gious facts to be discovered by faith, the whole rude machinery of his pragmatism would run smoothly. Once this wrench is thrown in, however, the logical works begin to clank and stall. Instead of independent logical grounds for religious claims, we get excuses for leaps of faith; and instead of an unambiguous theory of verifica- tion, we get an odd blend of empirical and practical confirmation. I do not want to minimize these problems; they are severe. But much of James's machinery will run, I think, with some modern adjustments.</page><page sequence="6">208 First, the reason why religious beliefs are generally untestable - why they are 'overbeliefs' - needs to be more carefully explained. Second, the sense in which the pragmatic utility of a belief might be said to 'justify' it, needs to be more sharp- ly distinguished from the kind of justification which overbeliefs, by definition, can- not have. Then the whole issue of the truth and possible justification of religious claims can be re-examined in a more helpful light. To make these adjustments, one has to start with the logical status of overbeliefs. That is still the key. Overbeliefs, I think, should be defined as supervenient claims, or as assertions which bear a supervenient relation to factual evidence.13 Overbeliefs supervene such evidence in much the same way in which judgments of value go beyond judgments of facts. Judgments of value represent a new species of judgment. Not only do they have commendatory and prescriptive aspects which are lacking in purely descriptive assertions, but they also come under a new set of standards and principles. Without these new standards and principles to discipline value judgments and to provide for a consistent application of evaluative terms, meaningful evaluations could not be made. Moral inquiries could not be rationally conducted. Aesthetic criticisms could not be framed. No normatively significant appraisals would be possible at all. Yet the supervenient claims which establish the necessary standards, thereby making evaluative judgments possible, depend on some underlying judgments of fact. If I describe an acquaintance as a good friend, for example, I must take this appraisal in view of various independently ascertainable characteristics - he is reliable, willing to share his time, sympathetic, and so on. The enumeration of these features does not in itself constitute a value judgment; for before any evaluative judgment can be passed, such characteristics have to be raised from mere descrip- tions to definitive marks of that which make a person a good friend. And that is where a new species of judgment comes in: judgments of value 'go beyond' des- criptions of fact because they introduce or presuppose the definitive standards and ideals for another level of interpretation. But these higher-level claims could not function as they do without a lower-level set of facts to interpret.14 Religious assertions possess the same logical feature. They too go beyond a mere description of that which is given in experience, and they too affect our disposi- tions by commending their objects. Yet they commend their objects in peculiar ways, not simply as things which are good or right but as things which are meaning- ful enough to sustain all other hopes and passions, all doomed in one way or an- other by finitude and failure. They do this because they provide an ideally de- fined perspective in which the point or purpose of everything else - the given facts of nature, the unpredictable ways of fate, the ceaseless struggles of history, and the unattainable aims of morality - can be encompassed and submitted to reflection. Religious beliefs, in fact, are the most supervenient of all beliefs, since everything which we might discover on prevenient levels of judgments leaves ultimate ques- tions of purpose and worth unanswered. To face such ultimate questions one has to enter into a wider sphere of teleological reflection framed by some distinctive set of concepts and principles. And one needs beliefs for that purpose, beliefs to carry one's thinking over into another realm of judgment.</page><page sequence="7">209 Much of this is implicit in James's remarks about overbeliefs. As a psychologist he described the religious experiences which people have; but that provided only a prevenient foundation of descriptive data, devoid of any higher implications about that which makes such experiences meaningful or worth having. Similarly, he knew that these experiences had to be submitted to higher forms of interpreta- tion before they could inform one's spiritual disposition and be discharged in ac- tivity. Consequently, James ventured his own overbelief to escape the limitations of psychology and pass on to the philosophy of religion. He said that the world of our present consciousness, corresponding to the natural world and to all we know about it, is part of a wider consciousness through which saving experiences may come.15 That, according to James, is the most rudimentary of all religious beliefs. I am not sure that he is right about that; the belief in 'saving experiences' may be too specific to count as the most generic religious belief. Yet it is an overbelief, for it lays the foundation for the search for 'saving knowledge.' It postulates a realm in which a sense of purpose or lasting worth might be discovered, and in so doing it vouches for the possibility of extending our judgments into a new arena, a 'wider world of consciousness.' The belief in a creator God does much the same thing. By portraying the world as the handiwork of a deity, this overbelief suggests that whatever exists has a pur- pose, that it is neither worthless nor arbitrary. Moreover, by describing the source of this purpose in anthropomorphic terms, the doctrine of divine creation defines the categories in which the search for life's meaning is to be sought and carried out. Our purpose is to do the 'will of God.' We are made for 'fellowship' with him. As his 'children' our happiness is to be found in reverence and obedience. Here a whole system of teleological thinking opens up across the logical bridge of an overbelief. The role of overbeliefs in opening up supervenient dimensions of judgment sug- gests a sort of Kantian strategy for their defense. Overbeliefs might be justified as the necessary conditions for making ultimate judgments of meaning or purpose. That is not exactly a pragmatic argument, but it reflects the peculiar logic of those beliefs whose function it is to institute supervenient forms of interpretation. The only trouble with this line of defense is that religious interpretations of experience are founded on a variety of overbeliefs, and there is no obvious reason to suppose that any of the resultant systems of judgment are reallly needed. People have emo- tional needs and personal anxieties which lead them to question the meaning of their lives and the point of their sufferings, and so religious beliefs are needed in one sense, a psychological sense. But this does not guarantee the existence of any religious truths or the possibility of any religious cognition. Perhaps religious inter- pretations of experience are arbitrarily imposed on it. Once this suspicion is aroused, the attempt to justify particular religious beliefs dissolves into the attempt to justify them as a class; and that, in turn, dissolves into the attempt to show that teleologically significant accounts of the world are mandated by reason or by experience. Much of James can be read as if this were his overriding aim. When he suggests that religious assertions might be justified by</page><page sequence="8">210 their own kind of utility, he need not be read as if he meant to provide a blue- print for defending any specific religious claims. He might better be read as if he meant to argue only for the general possibility of religious understanding, or for the cognitive relation which religious claims in general bear to the world. The practical benefits of holding certain religious beliefs, in other words, do not have to be construed as direct evidence for their truth. Instead of treating the capa- citating effect of a belief as the definitive criterion of its truth, one could regard this effect merely as a symptom of its dependent relation to reality. The practical benefits of a belief, that is, might provide a weak case for its truth, insofar as they are consistent with it; but they need not provide the warranted inference that the belief must be true. The inference from the practical effects of a belief to its truth or falsity is never that strong. Yet it might be strong enough to justify the weaker assumption that truth is at stake in matters of faith. This, after all, is an assumption which we regularly make in other fields of inquiry; we expect our cognitive ad- vances to be reflected in practical accomplishments or increased capacities, and we take these gains as symptomatic of the fact that the understanding which we seek in these inquiries is genuine understanding. From time to time our particular beliefs have to be revised or replaced; but as long as we make some practical progress in connection with the revision of our beliefs, we may believe that we are involved in the pursuit of truth and not simply building conceptual castles in the air. Why shouldn't the same be true in the case of religion? What, in the end, are all our verifications but experiences that agree with more or less isolated systems of ideas (conceptual systems) that our minds have framed? But why in the name of common sense need we assume that only one system of ideas can be true? The obvious outcome of our total ex- perience is that the world can be handled according to many systems of ideas, and is so handled by different men, and will each time give some characterist- ic kind of pro fit... Science gives to all of us telegraphy, electric lighting, and diagnosis, and succeeds in preventing and curing a certain amount of disease. Religion... gives to some of us serenity, moral poise, and happiness, and pre- vents certain forms of disease as well as science does...Evidently, then, the science and the religion are both of them genuine keys for unlocking the world's treasure house to him who can use either of them practically.16 The fact that science gives us telegraphy and electric lighting does not prove that its working hypotheses are true. It is logically possible that such accomplishments might be achieved by adhering to false beliefs. The same can certainly be said of religion; its successes could easily be due to the influence of false beliefs, just as its critics have always maintained. Nothing about the truth or falsity of scientific or religious beliefs follows from a description of the practical benefits of their application. So if one expects everything said in defense of such beliefs to under- write direct inferences about their truth, then pragmatic appeals are bound to be disappointing. Yet we are generally willing to accept the achievements of science as some sort of evidence for scientific claims, and the reason for this is that we are willing to</page><page sequence="9">211 accept the logically prior assumption that technological progress would not be pos- sible without at least some measure of true understanding. Given that assumption, the technological accomplishments of science provide indirect evidence for its working hypotheses. These hypotheses must be true in part, or to some degree, even though we cannot say exactly wherein the truth of a useful set of hypotheses lies. Revisions of some kind will almost surely be needed as science progresses. Why not say the same of religion? Why shouldn't spiritual achievements also depend on some measure of true understanding? The relationship between our understanding and our capacities should be the same in this case as it is in any other case. To acknowledge this point one need not endorse all pragmatic arguments for belief, for the 'profits' returned by a religion would still not tell us which of its be- liefs are true, or partially true, or definitely untrue. The practical benefits of a reli- gious system of thought do not testify that precisely to the truth it contains. Yet these benefits do suggest that there is an upper story of religious understanding to be unlocked in the 'treasure house' of our experience. As long as the mastery of various religious principles can be correlated with some measure of personal or spiritual progress, with increased capacities for living, it can be assumed that re- ligious interpretations of experience aim at a genuine form of understanding. All that one needs to show here is that understanding is capacitating, and then the bur- den of proof will fall on those who think that supervenient forms of understanding are arbitrarily imposed on experience. Whether these last two revisions in James's pragmatism can withstand criticism in the long run, I don't know. But they are plausible enough to restore an impor- tant presumption, badly shaken by positivistic philosophy. For by interpreting overbeliefs as the founding postulates of supervenient forms of judgment, and by claiming only loose pragmatic evidence for an overbeliefs relation to reality, reli- gion might be assigned a place among the many systems of ideas needed to handle the world in thought. The questions which experience raises in connection with the private concerns of individuals cannot be dismissed simply because they prove to be intractable on one or another prevenient level of inquiry (empirical science, for example). These are genuine questions which deserve an answer; and "it is only by acknowledging them as genuine questions, and living in the sphere which they open up, that we become profound."17 Skeptics, of course, may continue to think that people get out of their religious experiences only what they read into them; but that still requires an argument. And such an argument will be hard to find in an analysis of experience itself. 'Experience' is too rich to be reduced to strictly impersonal elements and too manifold to be confined to only one form of inter- pretation.18 Ill If all this seems like a weak apology for religious belief, that is not because the arguments themselves are so weak but because they are so general. At best James</page><page sequence="10">212 overcomes only the most sweeping, categorical, objections to religious belief, leaving every particular objection to particular doctrines completely untouched. Moreover, even if one grants to general arguments that our experience calls for some form of supervenient religious (teleological) interpretation, one still must face the fact that we are confronted with a bewildering variety of overbeliefs, all of which extend beyond the reach of evidence in prior domains of inquiry. The pragmatic value of these beliefs does not solve the problem. Pragmatic evidence, being indirect, is never that clear-cut. We need more guidance than pragmatic ap- peals can provide, therefore, in knowing where to turn for the teleological under- standing of life which we seek. James was plainly aware of this difficulty, and he tried to solve it in 'The Will to Believe.' In that essay, however, none of the considerations which he adduces in defense of "our right to adopt a believing attitude in religious matter" removes the gap between the evidence which we have at our disposal - including pragmatic evidence - and the conclusions which we are asked to draw. Most of the reasons which he gives in support of religious belief, as I said before, are actually excuses for taking leaps of faith without compelling grounds or absolutely reliable guides. We are forced to make de facto religious choices no matter what we do, the issues are too momentous to ignore, and we have little to gain but much to lose by being skeptical - all these are rationales for accepting religious claims (overbeliefs) without the necessary grounds to justify them.19 From the perspective of one who is troubled by the plurality of overbeliefs, these 'reasons' for faith must seem like poor substitutes for rational evidence. For they still do not tell the potential believer how to assess one religious belief vis-a- vis another. Yet there is something else in James's essay which does do this. In taking the risks of faith, he says, one must begin with living options. This at first seems to be another negative requirement, designed only to pare down the range of possible choices in matters of faith. But the more one thinks about what en- livens a religious belief, or any other supervenient claim, the more one realizes that evidence and formal criteria are not the only factors which play a rightful role in the formation of reasonable convictions. The factors which promote understanding and appreciation prior to belief - those which bring it alive as a personally appeal- ing possibility - are just as important in reasonable judgment as prior evidence and considerations of consistency or coherence. Indeed, when more telling reasons for affirming a belief are unavailable, as they always are when overbeliefs are at stake, these other factors are the most important of all. They are the only ones which can eliminate blindness and arbitrariness in matters of faith. The liveliness or deadness of religious options depends on one's relation to the beliefs at issue. Dead options, as James says, "make no electric connection" with us. They refuse to "scintillate" with credibility. Live options are just the reverse; they evoke tendencies already within us, drawing us toward them and making us willing to act in accordance with them. This tendency to act in accordance with an overbelief, when it has grown sufficiently strong, actually constitutes belief; so that the same factors which bring religious teachings to life also inspire conviction.</page><page sequence="11">213 As long as this enlivening is not impaired by intellectual obstacles (a big 'if), it simply turns into faith.20 Yet what exactly establishes the "electric connection" between a person and his overbeliefs? James barely even hints at an answer; but if overbeliefs are to be un- derstood as supervenient claims, a rudimentary answer should not be hard to sug- gest. Inasmuch as overbeliefs "build out" one's thinking by instituting supervenient dimensions of interpretation, the potential believer must feel the need for some higher form of reflection. He must recognize some aspects of his experience, that is, as hauntingly opaque - impervious to familiar forms of explanation and yet nonetheless in need of explanation. And this felt need, moreover, must be an affect of thought, or a conceptual need, not simply an emotional matter. Otherwise the faith through which such a need is met would not involve beliefs in any essential way. This means that the would-be believer needs to be able to raise questions about his experience, and yet these questions need not be so articulate that they presume any particular form of an answer. Indeed, that is why the questions with which religious belief begins are typically so inchoate. "What is the meaning of my life?" "Why was I born?" "Why is there anything rather than nothing?" "Why must we live, only to suffer and then to die?" Questions like these reflect the need to interpret the life we're given, to hold it in view as something acceptable', and yet they do not anticipate any particular form of response, as if the only way to find meaning in life would be by showing, for example, that it serves the purpose of a supernatural being. That represents only one kind of interpretation, not the only kind. One wants to make sense of the given facts of experience in trying to formu- late religious questions, but there is no way of knowing in advance what this sense amounts to. All that one can say is that the answers to our half-articulate questions about life's meaning, if these questions have answers, must yield some kind of sig- nificance . Those who labor under existential, or spiritual, concerns cannot be more specific about the meaning which they seek to discover, therefore, without drawing on some network of rudimentary concepts and beliefs to define them. Thus, the most basic teachings of a religion provide not only the means to address existential concerns, but also the means to articulate them. And that is where overbeliefs make, or fail to make, an "electric connection" with the potential believer. Before they provide answers, they give one a "handle" on his concerns. They disclose a perspective in which judgments of ulterior meaning and purpose become possible; and that in itself, completely apart from any particular conclusion which one might come to about the meaning of his own life, quickens belief. Hence a Christian might have no idea what purpose his life is to serve in God's plan; but the belief that there is a God who has a plan, that this God created all things for a purpose, and that every creature therefore has a valuable role to play in creation tells him, in principle, that he too has a purpose. Similarly, the Hindu may have no idea how he spent his previous existence; but the belief that he has had a previous existence, and that his present life is the just and natural consequence of his previous life, tells him that his individual fate makes sense, no matter how arbitrary it might</page><page sequence="12">214 seem. Here the overbeliefs which open up the possibility of supervenient forms of teleological explanation do not answer the potential believer's questions about the meaning of his particular life, but they vouch for its meaning. When one sees how his concerns can be encompassed and articulated in a system of thought which does that, the system begins to come alive as a viable option. That which quickens the tendency to adopt an overbelief, in other words, is an appreciative understanding of its point. The point of a religious belief is the force which it carries as a governing principle for a given system of interpretation. Since religious beliefs have a role to play in framing the most supervenient forms of teleological reflection, they also have a point. Yet this aspect of a beliefs mean- ing is not always apparent from the words used to formulate the belief, so that be- lief can degenerate into a pointless form of mere assent when the affirmation of a religious principle goes unaccompanied by the dispositional changes involved in bringing one's existential concerns under a new rubric of interpretation. Then one accepts a teaching but doesn't conform to it because he doesn't know how it is supposed to rule his reflection. Such pointless believing commonly occurs where there are social and familial pressures to hold certain beliefs, but it is rare where there are no such pressures. And the reason that it is rare is that pointless beliefs, or beliefs whose point is not appreciated, are not apt to be affirmed. If this obser- vation seems too innocuous to celebrate, one should remember that people often resist religious claims because they do not see any point in holding them. They simply do not see what is to be gained by conforming their thinking to the pattern of higher reflection which these beliefs define, and so they do not appreciate the promise which they bear as the means of reducing the brute facts of experience to some sort of acceptable view. If they did see a point in the overbeliefs urged upon them, they would have a reason to believe in them - not a logical ground for belief but a motive of sorts, an incentive which draws them toward a given system of thought by connecting its implications with their concerns. Once this connec- tion is made, the current of possibility begins to run through an overbelief, en- hancing its appeal. Of course, one might not act on the basis of such an appreciative understanding alone. One might well resist the appeal of the liveliest religious options for all sorts of intellectual reasons. But that is not the issue here; the intellectual difficulties of religious belief are too familiar to need rehearsing. The important thing to realize is that an appreciative understanding of the point of a religious belief, or of any supervenient principle, can be a properly motivating factor in its adoption. To be sure, this factor must give way whenever reasons of a stronger sort - e.g., conside- rations of consistency - are urged against a belief. But in the absence of such stronger reasons, the liveliness of one's religious options can be allowed to elicit as much faith as reason can bear. There is nothing irrational about that. We need reasons of this weaker variety to incite us with the promise of greater understand- ing and to give our purely critical faculties something to screen. "Reason," after all, does not always generate our beliefs. When overbeliefs are at issue and whole new orders of interpretation hang in the balance, something else</page><page sequence="13">215 precedes ratiocination and reason operates merely as a restraint. It operates as a restraint because the whole machinery of evidence, criteria, and argument which takes shape in one domain of judgment is powerless to define the foundations for another realm of judgment. So when supervenient forms of interpretation are needed to bring the facts of our experience into some higher evaluative perspective, there is nothing for the critically trained intellect to do other than to wait upon prior tendencies, ripened by spiritual concerns and quickened by teachings which promise a new way of making sense out of old perplexities. As these tendencies begin to move on in religious directions, reasoning of a critical sort will be needed to prevent religious enthusiasms from countenancing incoherent claims. Yet when the development of religious belief has proceeded that far, the potential believer no longer stands in the predicament of having to choose from a multitude of equivalent possibilities. For religious options do not all come alive at once. One is usually more disposed toward one form of belief than another, so that reason comes into play in a focused role as advocate, and as critic, of those teachings whose point we appreciate. This account of overbeliefs and live options still does not tell one what to be- lieve, but that should not be expected from a philosophical analysis of faith claims and their rationale. James wanted only to enliven the general possibility of reli- gious belief by defending them against the charge that they could only be blindly, irrationally, adopted. His reasons are still worth examining, both for those who are sympathetic to religious overbeliefs and for those who are not. NOTES 1.
