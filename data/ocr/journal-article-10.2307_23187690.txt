In August 2007, a whalebone mask was excavated from a 3,000-year-old settlement site in the eastern Aleutian Islands, Alaska. Although wooden masks are ethnographically com mon and well-documented from most other regions of coastal Alaska, examples made from bone or other materials are quite rare. The uses and significance of prehistoric masks are difficult to ascertain. Russians, the first Europeans to visit the Aleutian Islands, recorded ritual and ceremo nial use of masks by indigenous inhabitants during the latter half of the eighteenth century. Cer emonial mask use is also known from related cultures, especially Yup'ik and Inupiat Eskimos as well as Sugpiaq peoples (Kodiak Islanders). This investigation describes the Amaknak mask and the circumstances of its discovery, and draws on comparative material from local and neighbor ing regions for analysis and interpretation of the mask. Although conclusions remain specula tive, the Amaknak mask likely offers a glimpse at prehistoric Aleutian ritual and spiritual life. Introduction Eighteenth-century inhabitants of the Aleutian chain were the first Alaskan Natives to come into contact with Europeans (Russians), and subse quent interactions deeply changed Aleut indige nous ways of life. While eighteenth and nineteenth century explorers left basic descriptions of sub sistence and social organization (i.e., Merck 1980; Sauer 1802; Veniaminov [1840]1984), many ele ments of traditional Aleut lifeways remain elusive. For instance, little is now known of pre-contact re ligious and ceremonial practices, including those that involved masks. Knowledge of Aleut masks is therefore based on a small number of ethnographic objects and accounts, and even fewer archaeologi cal finds. The most recent discovery of a prehistoric Aleut mask occurred during excavations in 2007 at the Amaknak Bridge site (UNL-050), on Amaknak Island in the eastern Aleutians (Fig. 1). The Amaknak Bridge Site Mask The prehistoric settlement at the Amaknak Bridge site was located on a bedrock knoll overlooking Amaknak Channel, which lies to the north and east, separating Amaknak Island from Unalaska Island. The site was discovered during the Sec ond World War and was first excavated in 1977 by Glenn Bacon of the University of Alaska Museum. Excavations in 2000 and 2003 led by Richard Knecht of the Museum of the Aleutians and Rich ard Davis of Bryn Mawr College uncovered vari ous parts of the site, and further investigations in 2006 and 2007, led by Michael Yarborough, exca Jason S.

The site is significant for the stone-walled semi-subterranean houses and elaborate hearth complexes found there, as well as for the extensive collections of both lithic and bone artifacts that have been recovered. The settlement has been dated by an array of 26 radiocarbon dates from charcoal samples collected between 1977 and 2007, with results ranging from 3470 ± 70 B.P. to 2450 ± 40 B.P. (3922-3565 cal B.P. to 2618-2358 cal B.P.) (Yarborough et al. 2010:52). Site occupa tion therefore occurred during the Mid-Holocene period of global cooling known as the Neoglacial, which lasted from approximately 4,700 to 2,500 years ago. Faunal analysis indicates that subsis tence was almost entirely marine-based, with ex tensive utilization of fish, seabirds, and sea mam mals (Crockford et al. 2005). Artifacts, structures, and faunal remains from the site have been in terpreted as evidence of cultural change and ad aptation to colder climate conditions during the Neoglacial (Crockford and Frederick 2007:701; Knecht and Davis 2005, 2008:76). Structure archi tecture in particular, but also large numbers of elab orate objects of personal adornment (mainly la brets), as well as complex burials at the site, all provide evidence for technological innovation and increased social stratification during this period of Aleutian prehistory. During the final season of excavations at the Amaknak Bridge site in 2007, a bone mask was un earthed. The surviving portion of the mask was found in two fragments near the stone wall of an incomplete structure or dwelling. The mask frag ments were excavated from the structure's outer side, in an area of dense midden consisting pri marily of mixed faunal material such as clam shells, fishbones, and crushed urchin. Although no direct dating of the fragments themselves was undertaken, they were closely overlain by struc tures containing charcoal dated to 3030 ± 40 B.P. (Cal B.C. 1410-1190) and 3020 ± 70 B.P. (Cal B.C. 1425-1055) (Beta-233534, Beta-233532), dat ing the mask itself to at least 3,000 calendar years of age. The mask is currently housed at the Mu seum of the Aleutians in Dutch Harbor, Alaska (UNL050-17961-2). The mask was carved from a single verte bra; the vesicular structure of the bone is consis tent with whale. No speciation was attempted. The bone is quite porous and in places appears to have been stained with red ocher. The two fragments of the mask fit together and depict the forehead, the left eye, the bridge of the nose, both brow ridges, and a portion of the right eye of a realistic hu man face (Figs. 2 and 3). The eyes are oblong and pointed towards the outside of the face, and the eye-holes are perforated completely through the mask. The eyes are outlined by ridges in high re lief. The mask's surviving length is 10.5 cm, and the width is 10.2 cm. The back of the mask is hol lowed. No obvious means of attachment is appar ent (i.e., a mouthpiece or holes for suspension).</page><page sequence="3">Arctic Anthropology Figure 2. Whalebone mask excavated from the Amaknak Bridge site (UNL050 17961-2, Museum of the Aleutians). Photograph by Edward P. Arthur. Based on the dimensions of the surviving frag ments, the total dimensions of the complete mask are estimated at approximately 19 cm high by 16 cm wide. The archaeological context in which the mask was recovered gives little or no indication of the reasons for its manufacture and use. A wider survey of mask use in neighboring Alaska Native cultures may help to elucidate the cultural sig nificance of the Amaknak find. Geographic and chronological variability of mask use undoubt edly existed, but the overall spiritual and cultural meaning has likely maintained its larger regional integrity. The following survey contains historical descriptions of mask use, as well as comparative ethnographic and archaeological material from the Aleutians, Kodiak Archipelago, Western Alaska, and the North American Arctic. The Ethnographic Record Masks have been recorded in late prehistoric and contact-period contexts from the Aleutian Islands, the Alaska Peninsula, and the Kodiak archipelago (Black 2003:66; Desson 1995; Ray 1981). Masks are also known from the Yup'ik and Inupiaq cul tures north of the Aleut region on the Bering Sea and Arctic Ocean. In all these cultures, masks have played a significant role in ritual and ceremo nial performance as well as shamanistic activities (Fienup-Riordan 1987, 1996; Fitzhugh and Kaplan 1982; Ray 1967:6). They have been an integral ele ment of religion and society, inseparable from the overall complex of story, song, and dance that per meated most of the Arctic and North Pacific native cultures: Masks, taken as a whole, represented the complete range of Alaskan Eskimo cosmology, consisting of good and bad mythological beings that created man, his livelihood, and his ceremonies or, con versely, tried to destroy them; of deities, espe cially the sun and moon, which controlled certain aspects of men's lives; and of an array of spirits that could be manipulated for various purposes. Most religious masks belong to this last category, which can be subdivided further into masks that represent spirits of animals and inanimate objects, guardian spirits and shaman's tutelaries (helping</page><page sequence="4">Rogers and Anichtchenko: A Whalebone Mask from Amaknak Island 0 Whalebone Mask 49-UNL-050 (Amaknak Bridge Site) Figure 3. Schematic drawing of the Amaknak mask. spirits), and records of shaman's journeys to the spiritual world. (Ray 1967:6-7) In Yup'ik culture, for instance, masks were an essential part of the shaman's regalia, espe cially when presiding over major festivals and cer emonies. The theatrical aspect of these perfor mances was greatly enhanced by masks, figures, costumes, and emblems (Fitzhugh and Kaplan 1982:194). Masks often represented powerful spir its and projected complex symbolism. Although each mask was unique, the product of individ ual vision, there was continuity through the vari ous elements of iconography The ringed center as well the oft-used circle and dot motif have been explained as a ".. . metaphor for, and a means to achieve, a dynamic movement between worlds, be it spiritual cycling, supernatural vision, or social transformation" (Fienup-Riordan 1987:44). Despite the repeated use of common iconographic features, the interpretation of a given mask is often difficult or impossible without knowing the story, song, or event for which it was created. After the ceremo nies, often just a single performance, masks were burned, buried, or simply discarded, their ceremo nial energy exhausted (Fienup-Riordan 1996:94). Destruction of masks may also reflect a need for protection from these powerful (even dangerous) objects that facilitate travel between the human and spirit worlds. Yup'ik and Inupiaq masks were generally made of spruce or cottonwood driftwood and rarely of skin (Ray 1967:52). Ray (1967:75) suggests that the creation of large wooden masks only became widespread in these cultures after iron tools became widely available. Masks are also known from the Aleutian Is lands, although evidence is scarcer than in Yup'ik regions. Russians, the first Europeans to visit the Aleutian chain, observed mask use by the indige nous inhabitants. Contact-period Aleutian masks</page><page sequence="5">Arctic Anthropology were made and utilized for ceremonial purposes, often in the context of feasting, shamanistic perfor mances, or burial practices. For example, the Rus sian Orthodox priest Yakov Netsvetov, who served in the Atka District of Russian America (the west ern and central Aleutians) from 1828 to 1844, made the following remarks about local rituals: It was the business of the shamans to call the spirits and indicate which of them is to be revered and whose aid is to be invoked, etc. The spiritol ogy of the Atkans was extensive; they believed in the spirits of birds and fishes and other animals; of the sun, the sky and other inanimate creation, thinking that spirits exist within these. As the in tercourse with the spirits was solely the province of the shamans, the latter represented such spirits in the way they were able or wanted to, in the form of masks and visages. Such masks were yet seen by the writer of this account himself. (Black 2003:67) Another Russian priest, Ivan Veniaminov, re corded his observations of masked Atkan festi vals: "The festivals consisted usually in theatrical representations, accompanied by songs and drum music. On such occasions masks were used, false faces, and also various hunting weapons and other equipment, depending on the subject of the repre sentations conveyed by the dancers" (Veniaminov [1840] 1984:371). Veniaminov also documented mask use in ceremonies on Unalaska Island, where settlements took it in turns to present theatrical performances held in honor of guests invited from neighboring villages. The entire population of a village was usually involved in the ceremonies. Performers "... wore different masks and acted out anything they imagined; for instance a battle, a victory, and peace, taking of animals, and so on. During the entire performance, drum playing and songs never stopped, just changed according to the kind of the play [being presented]. Such per formances lasted several days, generally until all their prepared plays were finished" (Veniaminov [1840]1984:201). Natives of Unalaska reportedly also danced in the nude, wearing masks representing various sea animals. The masks were often ritually de stroyed following the performance: "The feasts concluded, the masks and drums are broken to pieces, or deposited in caverns among the rocks, and never afterwards used" (Coxe 1787:230). Members of the 1788 Russian scientific expedition to Siberia and Alaska wrote that Aleut masks fig ured especially prominently in winter and spring festivals. These masks were generally made the previous autumn (Merck 1980). Mask use was also connected with divination: We observe among them sufficient marks of such a religion, as might be expected from people in their situation . . . they have fortune-tellers em ployed by them at their festivals. These persons pretend to fortel events by the information of the Kugans or Daemons. In their divinations they put on wooden masks, made in the form in which they say the Kugan appeared to them; they then dance with violent motions, beating at the same time drums covered with fish skins. (Coxe 1787:217) Mask use was often treated with suspicion by the Russian church: "The priest (from Unalaska) upon hearing that some of our gentlemen had seen a cave where many carved masks were deposited, went and burnt them all. Not satisfied with this, he threatened the natives for worshiping idols" (Sauer 1802:160). As Orthodox Christianity be came prevalent within the Aleut population, the practices associated with mask use gradually died out. In 1840, Veniaminov ([1840]1984:229) wrote: "... as soon as they adopted Christianity, they abandoned shamanism and all signs of it such as false faces and masks which they used in dances and shamanistic seances." Comparative Material Few physical examples of Aleut masks have sur vived to the present day. Those that have are made either of wood or, more rarely, of whalebone. No ivory masks are known from the Aleut regions, but ivory maskettes and composite ivory masks have been found in the Canadian Arctic and Western Alaska (cf., Helmer 1986; McGhee 1996). Wooden, bone, and ivory masks will be examined as com parative material which may aid with the interpre tation of the Amaknak Bridge site mask. Wooden Masks Most surviving Aleut masks are fashioned from wood. All wooden Aleut masks can be divided into two groups according to their age, style, and whether or not they were intended to be worn. The first group (those not intended to be worn) consists of one nearly complete mask and three fragments found during excavations in the "Mask Cave" on Kagamil Island in 1948. The fragments were excavated from the lower levels of a burial; mummified remains had been collected from the same cave in 1936-1938. Radiocarbon dated to ca. 1690 B.P. (260 A.D.) (Bank 1953:44; Black 2003:70), these artifacts are most likely the oldest of the known Aleut wooden masks. To the degree to which the fragmentary remains allow interpre tation, all these masks belong to the same stylis tic type, with characteristic eyebrow relief, thin noses, and perforated eye-holes. Attachment holes and mouth grips are absent, suggesting that these masks were never intended to be worn. The second, more numerous group consists of masks with grotesque features and exaggerated noses and lips, greatly contrasting in style with the Kagamil masks described above. Unlike the</page><page sequence="6">Rogers and Anichtchenko: A Whalebone Mask from Amaknak Island Kagamil masks, the masks from the second group lack perforated eyeholes; the wearer rather looked out through holes in the nostrils. Not only do the two groups differ in stylistic elements, but also in functionality: the mouth grips and head sup port indicate that the masks from the second group were meant to be worn. The largest single collection of such masks is housed in the Chateau Musee in Boulogne-sur Mer, France, brought there by the French scien tist Alphonse Pinart, who traveled to the Aleutian Islands and the Kodiak Archipelago in 1871 and 1872. The Pinart Collection contains 15 wooden masks and mask fragments taken from a labyrin thine series of caves on Unga Island (Shumagin Islands group) (Fig. 4). These masks depict hu man faces with distorted features that might bear transcendental meaning, such as human-animal transformation or evocation of spirit-helpers. The masks and related artifacts were associated with human skeletal remains from four individuals, and Pinart surmised that the Unga cave was the burial place of whale-hunters. This conclusion was sup ported by Black (2003:80), who believed that the masks and other objects in the caves were associ ated with a whalers' cult, and that the masks "rep resented killer whales or, better said, men trans formed into killer whales." Two wooden masks collected by Captain II larion Arkhimandritov from Atka Island around 1848, now at the Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography (Kunstkamera) in St. Petersburg, Rus sia (Avdeev 1959), and 12 wooden masks (now scattered among various collections) obtained by Ted Bank from a cave on Tigalda Island in 1912 were also meant to be worn. Dating of all the above examples is lacking or ambiguous, although likely to be around or prior to the time of Euro pean contact. In addition to the surviving masks, there are also ethnographic drawings of wooden masks from the Aleutians. The main source is Gavril Sarychev, who in the 1790s recorded 15 "wooden dance masks" at Unalaska. The masks vary in style, ma terials, and the degree of realism of the depiction of the faces. Illustrations show features such as ear pendants, a headdress of feathers, and labrets with attached beads (Dall 1884:Figs. 71,72). Whalebone Masks Wooden masks are significantly more numerous than those made of whalebone. Whalebone masks are known from only four locations: Amaknak and Umnak islands (Eastern Aleutians), and from the Izembek Lagoon and Port Moller areas of the Alaska Peninsula (Fig. 5). All Aleut whalebone masks were collected from archaeological sites. In 1937 physical anthropologist Ales Hrdlicka excavated a whalebone mask from the Chaluka site on Umnak Island. The Chaluka mask is at the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of Natural History (Catalogue number A390539). The mask's features are relatively crude, with close-set eyes, the nose in relief, and a down-turned mouth. A wide knob at the top of the head may have served as an attachment point for suspension by a cord. The mask has not been dated, although the lower levels of this site date to approximately 4000 B.P. (Aigner 1978:14). Two more whalebone mask fragments are known from Amaknak Island, both collected by Naval officer and amateur archaeologist Alvin Cahn during the Second World War. Their fea tures are pecked or gouged rather than cleanly carved, and one is slashed with deep incisions. Both are at the American Museum of Natural His tory, New York (Catalogue numbers 60.2-4905, and 60.2-4865], Other whalebone masks are known from the Alaska Peninsula. Two "ceremonial" bone masks were excavated at the Hot Springs Village site (near Port Moller) in 1928 by the Stoll-McCracken Arctic Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History (Weyer 1930). The masks measure approximately 16 cm high by 12 cm wide. Weyer assumed that both masks were made from whale mandibles. One (60.01-5833) is round, with flar ing nostrils and a grimacing mouth (Fig. 6). De Laguna (1934:218) considered these facial features to be reminiscent of nineteenth century wooden masks from Point Hope and King Island. The sec ond mask (60.1-5834) is oval with a pointed head, large round eyes, and an open mouth with carved lips and tongue. The mouth has human teeth inset in both the upper and lower jaws (Fig. 7). Although not in direct association with a burial, this mask was uncovered "... a foot or so below some human leg bones, and about two feet below a human jaw bone" (Weyer 1930:260). The stratigraphic proximity does suggest a connec tion between the masks and the human remains. Dating is uncertain, although Workman (1966) dated charcoal samples from corresponding lev els of the Hot Springs site to between 2500 and 3000 B.P. A third whalebone mask from the Hot Springs Village site was excavated in 1977 by a team from Hokkaido University (Okada, Okada, and Kotani 1979, 1984) (Fig. 8). The discovery lo cation was near the trenches excavated by Weyer in 1928, in an area "remarkably rich in artifacts and remains." The piece, 20.5 cm high by 13.5 cm wide, is in fairly good condition and appears un broken. The head's shape is oval with a pointed top, similar to Weyer's second mask. Facial fea tures consist of oblong eyes, round nostrils, and an open mouth turned up at the right corner, rather unlike the two other Hot Springs Village masks. The mask excavated by the Okadas was</page><page sequence="7">72 ArC"CA«"""P0l0gy4S:1 u Figure 4. Wooden mask fragment from burial cave on Unga Island (989-2-003).

(Cal B.C. 1455-1015) and 3100 ± 40 B.P. (Cal B.C. 1445-1265) (Masch ner 2008:175). The other masks from the Alaska Peninsula come from Izembek, on the Bering Sea coast. In 1981, a local fisherman found a whalebone mask eroding from a beachside shell midden. This mask, now on loan to the Anchorage Museum, is somewhat deteriorated and is missing its mouth and chin. The surviving portion (Fig. 9) measures 16 cm in height and 15 cm in width. Rounded cheeks are apparent, and the eyes are outlined by raised ridges similar to those of the Amaknak mask. The mask's interior is hollowed. Shell col lected from the midden in which the mask was found was dated to 2990 ± 110 B.P. (Cal B.C. 1455—920) (O'Leary 2007:130). A second mask is known from the Izembek area, although it is now in a private collection and provenience is unclear (Black 2003:72). The second Izembek mask's size and features are very similar to those of the one excavated by the Okadas at Hot Springs Village (Okada, Okada, and Kotani 1979, 1984). Ivory Masks Another form of mask, while separated chronolog ically and geographically from the Amaknak find, is important to acknowledge. These are compos ite ivory masks of the Ipiutak culture, dating to ca. 1500 B.P., known only from three (or possibly four) examples, all from the Chukchi coast of northwest ern Alaska. These masks are made from numerous pieces of ivory held together with pegs or fastened with sinew. The assembled pieces form a general ized human face, while carvings on the ivory it self show composite interpenetrating zoomor phic images. The composite masks all come from burial contexts and are undoubtedly mortuary par aphernalia (cf., Larsen and Rainey 1948:137; Ma son 2009a, 2009b). Constructional and stylistic features of the Ipiutak masks are so clearly and vis ibly different from the Aleut examples that while temporal proximity requires acknowledgment, fur ther analogies are extremely questionable. Due to the general paucity of mask finds, in terpretations of the significance of these objects are various and often speculative. Prevalent explana tions for mask manufacture and use are presented below. Interpretations of Aleut Masks The most influential modern interpretation of Aleut masks was put forth by Lydia Black (2003:66), who asserted that they were used ritually to transform the wearer into a representation or incarnation of beings outside the human sphere, but with power to affect events in the human world. This interpreta tion points to broad similarities between Aleut and Eskimo cultures in two inseparable spheres: spiri tuality and daily life. More specific explanations of different mask types have also been attempted.</page><page sequence="9">74 Arctic Anthropology 48:1 Figure 6.

Whalebone mask from the Hot Springs Village site, exca vated in 1977 by Hokkaido University (adapted from Okada et al. 1984). Based on the relatively small size of the mask recovered at Chaluka, Hrdlicka (1945:464) as sumed that this category of mask was intended for children. Black (2003:71) disagreed, and classified all the whalebone masks as death masks represent ing the spirit or soul of the deceased. According to ethnographic information provided by informants from Umnak Island, this type of mask would be ritually placed in a grave with a corpse. The burial party also wore masks, which were broken at the end of the ceremony, and the pieces left at the gravesite. Black asserted that a lack of any obvi ous attachment mechanism (apertures for string or rods) indicates that these masks could not be worn, and were therefore placed unbroken on the dead person's chest. Herbert Maschner put forth another interpre tation, suggesting that these masks were worn on a cord around the neck, lying against the chest. Evi dence for this assertion is "a carved groove around the outline, behind the face" on well-preserved samples, as well as Norton culture sculptures that show faces on the chests of ivory figurines (Masch ner 2008:176). The mask recovered by the Okadas at Hot Springs Village is indeed circumscribed by a groove around the edge (Fig. 8). Black (2003:74) suggested that such grooving originally held hair. Neither the examples from Amaknak, Izembek, Chaluka, nor the earlier Port Moller masks feature grooving at any location. Another source of interpretation comes from the extensive research done on contact-period Aleut hunting visors and other headgear. Hats, masks, and visors constituted an integral part of the reciprocal village performances, as well as sa cred hunting rites. Sergei Ivanov (1930) argued that Aleut headgear was not only a masterful creative and artistic tradition, but had a symbolic function and was closely related to ritual zoomorphic head masks of the Pacific Northwest coast (cf. Black 1991). Roza Liapunova (1996:233) asserted that the Aleuts had no everyday hats, but that all headgear was intended either for hunting or for ceremonial/ festive functions. In her view, the hunting visor is a zoomorphic representation of a guardian spirit or animal protector, specifically a water bird such as a sea-duck. Black (1991:13), building on the work of Ivanov, proposed that all hunting headgear was essentially a mask which transformed the wearer into a mighty hunter, simultaneously endowing him with supernatural vision and hiding his hu man identity. Visors and other headgear were thus functionally equivalent to masks and had the same transformative capacity.</page><page sequence="12">Rogers and Anichtchenko: A Whalebone Mask from Amaknak Island 10 cm Figure 9.

These analyses are based on ethnographic observations of Aleut rituals recorded in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. There are no ethnographic descriptions of bone masks, and it is difficult to say to what degree the inter pretation of wooden masks from late pre-contact and contact period can be applied to archaeologi cal bone masks. The time factor is likely more im portant than the construction material, as the ca. 1,700-year-old wooden Kagamil masks with their perforated eye-holes are more similar in style (and possibly function) to the bone masks than are the contact-period wooden masks. The somewhat ambiguous context of the Amaknak mask complicates the interpretation of this object. Although not in direct association with burials, many internments were present at the site and had potentially been disturbed in antiquity, their contents strewn. Anthropomorphic represen tations of any sort are rare in the Aleutians during this period (ca. 2000-3000 years B.P.), and only three other objects with recognizable human vis ages (an ivory pendant and two bone pins) were recovered from the Amaknak site. The extreme rarity of human representation (and particularly masks) suggests that, at least during the period in question, they were special and outside the realm of everyday life.</page><page sequence="13">78 Arctic Anthropology 48:1 Conclusions The uses, functions, and meanings of prehistoric Aleut masks remain poorly understood. The small number of known examples (and lack of recovery from consistent undisturbed contexts) has resulted in speculative and widely differing interpretations of mask functions. Comparative ethnographic ma terials, however, do suggest that masks played a significant role in ceremonial performances, fu neral rites, and other rituals. Analyzing the en tire complex of finds, it is important to note both the rather narrow chronological timeframe, as well as the fairly extensive geographic distribution of whalebone masks from the Eastern Aleutians to the Alaska Peninsula. This broad geographic dis tribution suggests mutual influences and connec tions, and perhaps even ritual and social conti nuity along a wide fringe of the southern Bering Sea ca. 2800-3300 B.P. (also hinted at by other forms of material culture and behavioral pattern ing, cf., Dumond 2001, 2008). The complex of ar chaeological material represented by the Amaknak mask as well as other whalebone masks discussed above strongly suggests cultural unity and simi larity of belief and ritual practices stretching from the Aleutian chain to the eastern Alaska Penin sula during the 3rd millennium B.P. Further re search may clarify the degree and extent of this connection. Acknowledgments.
