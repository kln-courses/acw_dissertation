MORE, USDA Forest Service, Northeastern Forest Experiment Station, Amrn herst, MA 01003 Abstract: Many of today's children first come in contact with wildlife through the medium of children's books. Because these books are sold through the marketplace, the number of books about a specific animal may be a general indicator of that animal's popularity, i.e., the more popular an animal, the greater the number of books written about it. Using a comprehensive index of titles, I categorized children's stories about animals. More than 60% of the animals mentioned in the titles were mammals; birds accounted for an additional 18%. Publishers target books about mammals at the youngest age groups. These findings raise several interesting points about wildlife preferences and anthropomorphism. I grew up with Buster Bear, Reddy Fox, Old Mrs. Crow, and Winnie-the- Pooh. Today's children, though more so- phisticated in many ways, still delight in many of these same characters and books. Not surprisingly, books about wildlife or that feature wildlife characters make up one of the largest, most popular cate- gories of children's literature. They may also provide an interesting and useful in- dicator of wildlife preferences in our so- ciety. Recent studies have used question- naires to survey people about their wild- life preferences (Bart 1972, Dagg 1970, Dawson et al. 1978, and Fazio and Belli 1977). Although these studies have pro- vided direct information about prefer- ences, there are 2 important limitations inherent in this method. First, it is im- possible to have people rate every pos- sible animal, so some subset of species must be arbitrarily chosen. Second, pref- erences as expressed on questionnaires do not always correspond well to peo- ple's actual behavior-what people say they like is one thing; what they are will- ing to pay for is another. As an indicator of wildlife preferences, the frequency with which an animal is represented in children's books is not subject to these limitations. Because the entire animal kingdom is represented, 274 people have the opportunity to express all their preferences in actions on the open market-if you do not like snakes, you do not buy books about them; in- stead, you buy a book about an animal you do like. Thus, when an animal is pop- ular, there should be a large number of books available about it. Conversely, when an animal is less popular, there should be fewer books about it on the market. In this paper, I present the results of a study of the frequency with which var- ious animals were represented in chil- dren's books and the average age of chil- dren for whom publishers considered these books appropriate. METHODS To investigate animal themes in children's liter- ature, I searched the title index of Children's Books in Print (Xerox Corporation 1972). Each title that included the name of a specific animal (or that con- tained a related word such as "animal," "mammal," or "wildlife") was recorded. Occasionally, a book that had virtually nothing to do with animals was encountered-for example, a story about the Baltimore Orioles baseball team. These books were excluded from the analysis. However, I also excluded obvious animal stories such as Bambi, The Yearling, and Black Beauty because no animal is mentioned in the title. Finally, each title was accompanied by a range of school grades for which the publishers felt the book was best suited (i.e., preschool, grades 5-8, grades 10-12, etc.). These grade ranges were converted to their age counterparts and the mid-point of that</page><page sequence="2">WILDLIFE PREFERENCES AND CHILDREN'S BOOKS * More 275 Table 1.

Thus, a book considered ap- propriate for kindergarten through third grade would be transposed to ages 5-8 with a mid-point of 6.5 years. By averaging these mid-points, the mean age of readers of books about a specific animal or class of animals was obtained. Since these mea- surements were taken for every book within the population, statistical tests were not performed; any difference between means is a true difference for this population. Individual animals were grouped by scientific classification. The entire animal kingdom was cov- ered, so there was no distinction between domestic animals and wildlife. ANIMALS IN BOOKS Of 40,250 children's books in print in 1972, 5,326 (13.2%) had 1 or more ani- mals listed in the title. This figure prob- ably underestimates the total number of books about animals because of the lim- itations mentioned previously. More- over, had I coded the remaining chil- dren's books by category (e.g., sports and adventure), I probably would have found that animal stories are the most popular category. Of the books that could be grouped by class, 62.3% were about mammals (Table 1), and 17.9% were about birds. This overwhelming dominance is clear evi- dence of the popularity of these classes. Within the class Mammalia, books about carnivores predominated, account- ing for more than 45% of the total (N = 1,405). The next most popular mammals were the orders Perissodactyla (N = 495), Artiodactyla (N = 401), and Rodentia (N = 274). Ducks and geese (Anseriformes) were the most common birds (N = 175) and perching birds were the next most com- mon (Passeriformes, N = 112). Turtles (N = 67) were the most common reptiles and frogs (N = 77) were the most com- mon amphibians. Most books about fish were general rather than dealing with specific orders, genera, or species. For arthropods, books about the order Hy- menoptera (N = 109) were the most com- mon, followed by books about butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera, N = 67). The 25 most popular animals at the genus level are listed in Table 2. Most children are first exposed to ver- tebrates, then arthropods and mollusks, based on the publisher's intended age group (Table 1). The highest average age of readers was associated with inverte- brates such as protozoa, sponges, and cor- al. For vertebrates, the lowest mean age of readers (8.6) was associated with mam- mals, indicating that most children begin to learn about the animal kingdom through them. At the order level, the low- est mean age was associated with Eden- tata (/, = 6.3); the next highest mean ages were associated with Lagomorpha (A = 6.8), Tubulidentata (a = 7.0), and Roden- tia (Ix = 7.6). At the genus level, the mam- mals most likely to be encountered at an early age (that is, those with 10 or more books about them) are hippos (6.7 years), rabbits (6.8), porcupines (6.9), squirrels (7.0), and bears (7.2).</page><page sequence="3">276 Wildl.

DISCUSSION My analysis raises a number of inter- esting questions. First, the hypothesis that these data show wildlife preferences should be examined further. When the frequency data for this study and from actual surveys of wildlife preferences are compared, the results are mixed. For ex- ample, preference surveys of urban resi- dents indicate greater preference for birds than mammals (Dagg 1970, 1973, Dawson et al. 1978). This may be due, in part, to nuisance problems associated with many urban mammals. In a more ru- ral setting, Idaho nonconsumptive wild- life users expressed greatest preference for deer and bear-2 of the most com- monly occurring animals found in chil- dren's books (Fazio and Belli 1977). Sim- ilarly, Bart (1972) found that horses and dogs-the 2 animals found most fre- quently in children's books (Table 2)- topped his list of preferred species. Sev- eral other animals listed in Table 2 were also high on Bart's popularity list. I conclude that the frequency with which an animal appears in children's lit- erature is a positive but imperfect indi- cation of wildlife preference. Although this frequency does not substitute for di- rect information on preferences, it does provide an interesting crosscheck against which these studies can be compared. If we assume that the number of books about a given animal is a good indicator of societal preference, we still must ex-</page><page sequence="4">WILDLIFE PREFERENCES AND CHILDREN'S BOOKS M More 277 plain why mammals and birds predomi- nate. One possible explanation is biolog- ical-as a mammal, man may be better able to identify with other mammals than with other classes. We have shared phys- iological characteristics-warm blood, hair, and nursing young. Also, other mammals have always been a prime source of food, clothing, and material for shelter. It seems natural that we should strive to interest our children in mam- mals at an early age. In the context of evo- lution, animals of other classes may have been of relatively less importance to us. This could explain why mammals ac- count for so large and varied a portion of children's books, and also why they were associated with the lowest mean age. While our biological heritage may ac- count for many of our preferences for wildlife at a general level, the actual number of books about a particular species also reflects current socio-cultur- al trends. A popular television show or movie (e.g., Jaws) may heighten public interest in a particular species, and this interest may eventually be reflected in children's books. In fact, it should be pos- sible to monitor trends in wildlife pref- erences by periodic examinations of the frequency with which specific animals appear in children's books. The content of children's books is also of great importance to wildlife biologists. With more and more children growing up in large cities, children's books may be an increasingly important influence on people's beliefs about, and preference for wildlife (More 1977). Although a sys- tematic examination of story content is beyond the scope of this study, it is in- teresting to speculate about it, especially in relation to the findings about age. For instance, it is evident that publishers aim books about some animals to younger children and others to older children (Tables 1 and 2). In general, more ver- tebrates-especially mammals-are aimed at younger children than are ar- thropods, mollusks, and other inverte- brates. At the same time, specialists in children's reading habits have noted that younger children, particularly those younger than age 9, prefer stories with highly anthropomorphized characters (Arbuthnot 1957, 1969, Jan 1973). This may have implications for many wildlife- related programs, for example, the use of DDT. Although this insecticide had dev- astating effects on populations of bene- ficial insects and soil invertebrates, the general public did not seem concerned until biologists pointed out the adverse effects of DDT on bird populations. This lack of concern may reflect greater an- thropomorphism of birds than of insects and invertebrates. As another example, the bear is one of the most popular animals in children's literature. Because bears are introduced to children in the younger age groups, it seems likely that bears will be highly an- thropomorphized. This may be the cause of some of the people/bear problems cur- rently faced by wildlife managers (Bryan and Jansson 1973). Similar examples can be found wherever people interact with wildlife. CONCLUSIONS The children's books discussed here actually reflect a range of public tastes extending far beyond children them- selves. For example, the books are writ- ten by adults and probably reflect their animal preferences. These books pass through a series of editors and publishers who are keenly interested in current pub- lic tastes. Finally, they may be purchased by a broad spectrum of people-by adults for children, at the instigation of chil-</page><page sequence="5">278 Wildl. Soc. Bull. 7(4) 1979 dren, or perhaps by the children them- selves. Thus, these books both condition future preferences and reflect the current popularity of individual animals. This study shows that mammals and birds are the most popular animals in books for children and they account for over 80% of all children's books about animals. Mammals are the most finely differentiated of the classes with the greatest number of individual species represented in the books. Mammals also tend to be introduced to children at an earlier age than are members of other classes. The list of the 25 most common ani- mals in children's books is somewhat sur- prising in its scope, containing such di- verse creatures as lions and mice, ants and whales. Speculation about why these animals are so popular could be almost limitless; inventive readers may enjoy supplying their own explanations. Future research should continue to monitor trends in wildlife preferences, both directly by questionnaire surveys and indirectly with techniques such as those presented in this study. Also, since animal books comprise a major portion of all children's literature, we must begin examining story content and its relation- ship to anthropomorphism. At what age does anthropomorphism develop and how is it related to the content of chil- dren's books? Do books bring anthropo- morphism about or do children simply pass through a developmental stage when they prefer anthropomorphic books? At what age do children pass be- yond this stage? Until we can answer these and related questions more explic- itly, wildlife professionals should work closely with information and education specialists to ensure that children devel- op accurate images of animals.
