BERNARDIN DE SAINT-PIERRE (I737-i814), rmoralist, aesthete, and biologist, was born in the thn new and busy port of Havre in the midst of exotic influences. Trained as an engineer, he found himself temperamentally disqualified for the administrative contacts of the government . service. He vagabonded through Holland, Poland, and Germany, and was made Inspector of Fortifications by CATHERINE THE GREAT at St. Petersburg. Failing here he retuirned to France where his importunities led to his reinstatement, on condition that he enter the colonial service. Fortunately for his future career, he was detailed to the Ile de France (1768-1770) where he was surrounded by the vegetation of the tropics and familiarized himself with the wealth and variety of marine life of the tropical seas. Even more significant was his intimate association with M. PIERRE POIVRE, the governor of the island, and his intellectually brilliant young wife. POIVRE as missionary and explorer had travelled extensively in China and Indo-China, and had become deeply interested in the introduction and acclimatization of tropical plants into the colonies of France with a view of freeing his native land from the Dutch monopoly of the East Indian trade. The botanical opportunities thus afforded in Mauritius were later supplemented in France by his brief (I792) service as Intendant at the Jardin des Plantes and his later herborizations and excursions about Paris with ROUSSEAUIJ His Voyage G l'lle de F'rance (1773), Etudes de la Nature (1784), and Paul et Virginie (1790), had won him such renown that he was chosen to fill the. administrative post held by BUFFON; but his more scientific colleagues at the Jardin opposed him, and the infelicities of his tempera- ment unfitted him for the responsibilities of the position. The dominant philosophy of SAINT-PIERRE was a beneficent providence underlying all nature. His interpretations were anthropocentric, but he was far more analytical than the herbalists, and a keener observer than the naturalists who had preceded him. He was not an encyclopedist, a systematist, nor an anatomist. Professor ROULE awwards to him the distirnction of a biologist because of his penetrating generalizations, some of which are surprisingly modern in. their implications or content. His observations in natural history are pervaded by. the idea of the interrelations of organisms, i.e. of ecology. He keenly perceived the</page><page sequence="2">266 Isis, xxIiI) I phenomena of adaptation. Although his interpretation was at times ludicrously anthropocentric, he nevertheless anticipated DARWIN in apprehending the survival values of mimicry, symbiosis, and protective resemblances. His observations on colonial corals led him to the formulation of ideas anticipatory alike of the cell theory, and the organismal concept in its more recent formulations. He anticipated the promorphology of HAECKEL in his appreciation of bilateral symmetry and the major axis, and formulated the interrelations of the floating life of the sea before HENSEN invented the term plankton. His seriated chains of mollusks suggest orthogenesis, and his harmonies are comparable to the correlations of CUVIER, and the finaliue harmonique of CLAUDE BERNARD. His anthropomorphism led to his interest in the distribution of plants and to the concept of a scientific phytogeography. It also led him to propose the utilization of predatory insects and parasitic diseases for the destruction of insect enemies of crops-the first formulation of the idea of biological control. SAINT-PIERRE was thus not only a man of letters and a philosopher, but an initiator of many ideas of modern biology. May I i, 1934. CHARLES A. KOFOID.</page></plain_text>
