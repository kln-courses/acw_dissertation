<plain_text><page sequence="1">LANGUAGE, GOD AND EVIL This paper is an attempt to enucleate some basic assumptions of the free will defence by constructing a formal base language ex- pressing, albeit minimally, some of the relevant concepts, and consider- ing some possible extensions of this language. The paper is intended to be a contribution to what we might call "theological dialectic" - the reasoned evaluation of disputation between theologian and atheologian through the isolation of basic commitmentstores common to both disputants, and location and analysis of points of disagree- ment.1 The object of the paper is simply a clear statement of the key assumptions involved, and not settlement of the dispute. The former goal, while less ambitious in itself, is clearly a necessary condition of a rational approach to the latter. Before constructing the language, I try to set out, in a very simplified form, the argument from evil and the free will defence. The problem of evil may be set very simply, and I think elegantly, through this argument. 2 Every existent state of affairs proceeds from God. Evil exists. Therefore, evil proceeds from God. The problem is that any adequate theology seems committed to acceptance of both premises and rejection of the conclusion, despite the validity of the argument. The two main responses or theodicies are the free will defence and what amounts to rejection of the second premise, the doctrine that evil is merely a lack (lacuna) . A more powerful and more usual formulation is achieved through modifying the first premise by citing God not specifically as the agent of every actual state of affairs, but as a being who could have prevented the 1 Vide C.

Every existent state of affairs could have been prevented from existing by God. Evil exists. Therefore, evil could have been prevented from existing by God. As before, while the argument is uncontestably valid, and an ade- quate theology seems committed to acceptance of both premises, the conclusion is theologically troublesome. It seems to imply that God is not wholly good, insofar as we would expect a wholly good being to prevent evil if he could. 3 And any reasonably adequate theology would seem committed to the goodness of God. To put it Hume's way, the existence of evil seems to imply an inconsistency between divine benevolence and omnipotence. 4 The advantage of posing the problem of evil in this oversimplified dual format is that it imposes a clear structure on the main force of the argument, and will thereby serve to sharpen the response of the free will defender to it. The free will defence can now be clearly seen as, in its essentials, a dual response to either of the arguments above. 5 First, and most obviously, the free will defence is a qualified accept- ance of the conclusion. It is true, argues the free will defender, that evil proceeds from God, or could have been prevented by God. God could have created an evil-free universe, it is conceded, but he could have done so only by eliminating an amount of good in the universe outweighing the goodness of the removed evil. So conceived, an evil- free universe would be an insipid place, inhabited by automaton-like beings, entirely acking in the virtues associated with creative responses to adversity such as heroism, ingenuity and self-sacrifice. 6 Whether the actual world is better or worse than an evil-free universe is a matter that can be settled only by thought-experiment, by trying to construct a picture of a possible world that corresponds as closely as possible to 3 J.

One thing to clearly observe is that the beings in such a world could still be free. That is, they could still sometimes have a range of options open to them. But the evil options would always be excluded. These possible persons might not be free to do evil. But they would still presumably be able occasionally to choose among non-evil-tending options. 7 Never- theless, argues the free will defender, such a world would sacrifice an amount of good that outweighs the excluded evil. Thus the ques- tion is raised whether God could create a world in which men freely decline to sin. 8 But the free will defence, we said, is a dual response, and it has an- other distinct aspect. In pursuing his argument, the free will defender often implicitly deviates from the first premise. For in conceding that everything proceeds from God, he seems to concede that there is only one really effective agency in the universe, thus leaving no room for human agency or freedom of action. Or to put the problem in terms of the second formulation, a completely and fully omnipotent agency operative in the universe excludes the possibility of any free agents not identical with itself. 9 It is possible to locate the problem in a more exact form. Even though it is not possible to unproblematically characterize the concept of an omnipotent agent exactly, 10 we can say of any agent initially that if he is omnipotent it should be possible for him to bring about any unactualized contingent state of affairs. Oa z&gt; (Vp) (M*Sap) Here we use r5a p1 to represent "a brings it about that p obtains/' Actions, thus represented, are said to be relatively possible when the description of the action in question is consistent v/ith the set of scientific laws and the relevant antecedent conditions. n To say that an action is possible, as symbolized by the expression rM* 6a p1 is equivalent to saying that the agent controls the state of affairs p, 7 Vide St. Anselm, De Libertate Arbitrii, Ch.

We shall consider two areas in which this language could in- terestingly be extended by adoption of further axioms. These project- ed areas of extension correspond to the two pivotal loci of dispute between theologian and atheologian relative to the problem of evil as outlined above. The first problem is the free will defender's ambivalent stance to- ward the first premise of the argument from evil. On one side, the free will defender appears committed to the premise that God is omnipotent, but the definition of omnipotence must not be so strong as to rule out the possibility of human free will in some form. This problem can be introduced through the notion of a control stalemate. 17 If an agent a has the power to bring it about that p, and another agent b (a =£ b) has the power to bring it about that ~p, then one agent or the other must have merely an illusory power. If I have the power to make this piece of chalk move from position pi to p2 and you have the power to make it remain stationary at pi, then one of us must delude himself that he has such a power. For at a given time, either the chalk is stationary at pi or not. There is no third alternative. And if you really have the power to make it remain at pi, and exer- cise that power, then my ostensible option of moving it is foreclosed at that time, and it follows that I did not have the power to move it at that specific time. Thus as long as power is relativized to a specific state of affairs occurring at a definite time-interval, if a controls p at t, then there can be no b (b =*= a) who controls ~p at t. a ^ b 3 (M*5apD - M* 5b - p) We might call this the Power Stalemate Principle. This principle appears to be independent from (A M* 5 1) and (A M* 6 2) in System M* 6 (though we cannot prove this in the absence of a 16 For discussion of the axioms for 6, see Frederic B. Fitch, "A Logical Analysis of Some Value Concepts," Journal of Symbolic Logic, 28 (June 1963), 135-142. The axioms for M* are discussed by Anthony Kenny in "Freedom, Spontaneity and Indifference," Essays on Freedom of Action, ed, Ted Honderich (London and Boston: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1973), 89-104. The notion of indirect agency is discussed in Douglas Walton, "Logical Form and Agency", Philosoph- ical Studies, forthcoming. 17 See also Douglas Walton, "Modalities in the Free Will Defence," Religious Studies, 10 (September 1974), 325-331.</page><page sequence="7">160 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION semantics for M* 6) , and it therefore constitutes one way in which M* 5 might be significantly extended. The problem that this principle poses for the free will defender is easy to see. Assume that each state of affairs in the universe is such that God can either bring it about or not (omnipotent) . It follows that a given human agent, a, never has the power to bring about any event at all. For assume that a has the power to bring it about that p at t. M* 5a p Then it follows by the Power Stalemate Principle that every indi- vidual b, not identical with a, lacks the power to bring about ~p at t. But by hypothesis, this is false, since there is at least one individual, God, who has the power to bring about ~p at t. In the extended System M* 8, it seems impossible to maintain divine omnipotence and human freedom without contradiction. The problem generally is that human freedom must be meshed within divine control. God's almighty power must be characterized in such a way that it leaves room within its sphere of operation for other free agencies. The possibility of a power stalemate shows the need for interpreting 'omnipotence5 in the first premise of the argument from evil in such a way as to prevent premature collapse of the free will defense. The question of how an eternal deity interacts with the world as we know it is thus posed. Does God act specifically and individually, or is divine action more indirect, more vicarious and somehow more subtle in its operation ? 18 Does God control specific states of affairs, or is it rather anthropomorphic and trivial to conceive of God as a "super-agent" basically modelled on the notion of a human agent ? Often theology seems to prefer the idiom of creation - God created the universe, he programmed it, so to speak, but he does not, nor does he need to, interfere in its daily operation. The notions of action and control seem inadequate or perhaps even inapposite here. As stan- dardly conceived , control is relative to scientific laws and antecedent conditions, 19 and it seems theologically inadequate to think of God thus bound. Through these traditional problems, we are led to our second problem that faces the free will defender. This problem is also 18 See William Wainwright, "Freedom and Omnipotence," Nous, 2 (1968), 293-301, and Alvin Plantinga, The Nature of Necessity (Oxford: Oxford Uni- versity Press, 1974), p. 190. 19 Vide Myles Brand, op. at., note 10.</page><page sequence="8">LANGUAGE, GOD AND EVIL 161 to some extent mirrored in problematic possible extensions to the language M* 5. The free will defender can counter the argument from evil by replying that God cannot bring it about that man freely declines to sin. Whether I sin is up to me, and God does not exercise control over my option, even though he is in some sense omnipotent. Thus it is not possible for God to create a world wherein evil options exist and yet men freely always avoid them. 20 The principle appealed to here can be formulated in M* 5 as follows. 5a 5b p =&gt; ~ M* 5b ~ p where a 3= b To paraphrase: if a brings it about that b brings it about that p, then b does not control his bringing it about that ~p. In other words, if a brings it about that b does p, b does not do p freely. We miprht call this possible extension of M* 5 Plantinga's First Principle. 21 The question it raises, that of the interpretation of iterated 5-operators in M*5, is not unproblematic. But insofar as we can make intuitive sense of expressions like 'a brought it about that b brought it about that p,' Plantinga's Principle seems generally reasonable as an extension to M*5. What is questionable is the application of this principle to the problem of evil. For, as we saw above, it seems theologically aberrant to speak as though human agency is commonly, or perhaps ever, a direct result of divine agency. Rather God actualizes a world in which human agents play their roles. God brings about a state of affairs q such that if q obtains a given human agent brings it about that p. In Plantinga's Second Principle, 22 the antecedent is weakened, thus making it a stronger principle than the first. 5a 5b p =) ~ M* 5b ~ p To paraphrase: if a indirectly brings it about that b (directly) brings it about that p, then b does not do p freely. Or, to produce an equiva- lent by substitution of the definition of 5, [5a q &amp; 5a (q 3 5b p) ] =&gt; M* 5b ~ p 20 See Alvin Plantinga, "Which Worlds Could God Have Created ?" The Jour- nal of Philosophy, LXX (October 1973), 539-552. 21 Vide Plantinga, op. at., m note 18, 5421. 22 Plantinga, op. at., in note 18, 54311.</page><page sequence="9">162 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL FOR PHILOSOPHY OF RELIGION If a brings about a state of affairs q such that if q obtains b brings it about that p, then b does not freely do p. An example: if God brings about a state of affairs q such that if q obtains I sin, then I do not sin freely. How reasonable this principle is appears to be quite contro- versial. It seems that incompatibilists like Plantinga are more friendly to it than compatibilists like Flew. 23 We could not prove independence without a semantics for M* 8, but either of Plantinga's Principles, taken separately, would appear to be independent from the previous set, if considered as axioms additional to those we have considered in M* 8. The second principle is stronger, implying the less contro- versial first one, while the converse implication does not obtain. What is needed, in order to resolve the issue of the reasonableness of these two principles is not more of the familiar polemical arguments of theologian contra atheologian, but an examination of the logical consequences of adjoining the principles to the base language M* 8. Some of these consequences may turn out to be quite surprising to compatibilist and incompatibilist alike. What is needed generally in this area is a clear statement of the assumptions involved rather than speculations based on the nebulous intuitive notions of omnipotence, freedom and action. Possible-worlds semantics 24 is an essential part of the language of action, control and omnipotence, but by itself a se- mantical approach is not an adequate substitute for an explicit syn- tactical account of religious language. The expressions, sentences, axioms and rules of religious discourse relative to the problem of evil must be set out clearly so that the basic assumptions can be agreed upon as a preliminary to extending the zones of agreement between theologian and atheologian with the ultimate aim of clearly isolating and stating the real points of disagreement. Only then can religious symbolism be raised to the level of theology, can religious rhetoric be raised to the level of rational dialectic.
