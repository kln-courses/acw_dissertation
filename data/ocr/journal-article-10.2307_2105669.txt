<plain_text><page sequence="1">DISCUSSION MUST GODS MADDEN MADDEN? Professor Edward H. Madden has in recent years been spending much wit and energy on attempts to show that naturalism is a vastly more rational position than any form of theism. The questions I wish to raise here concern his two papers in this journal, "The Many Faces of Evil" (henceforth M.F.E.), and "On the Difficulty of Evading the Problem of Evil" (henceforth D.E.P.E.).' Both these articles deserve careful reading by philosophers of religion. Indeed, several of Madden's attacks on the inferential cheating and closed-mindedness of some of our era's leading religious thinkers should be welcomed by fair-minded theists, skeptics and atheists alike. I hope he will come to agree, however, that several of his own arguments are not good enough either; hence that an in- sistence on their improvement or rejection should be welcomed by fair- minded atheists, skeptics and theists alike. Question L. Would Madden say that he is capable- of dispassionately considering this question of natural theology: "Are all or many of the events which we tend to attribute to inanimate nature really due to some hidden and unbelievably powerful personal agency or agents?" 2 Madden writes in D.E.P.E. "A feeling for the depth and pervasiveness of evil is so great in some people that Christianity is not even a live hypothesis for them. They can stand gratuitous evil if it comes from a naturalistic world that knows neither good nor evil or comes from a genuinely evil world, but they could not bear to hear from any provi- dential source whatever that it is not really gratuitous evil after all - that there is some point to it." 3 Some such tyranny of wrath and resent- ment over reason and relevantly detached reflection seems too often to underlie Madden's own standpoint. In M.F.E. he lengthily quotes and 1 Edward H. Madden, "The Many Faces of Evil," PPR, Vol. XXIV (1964), pp. 481-492; Edward H. Madden and Peter H. Hare, "On the Difficulty of Evading the Problem of Evil," PPR, Vol. XXVIII (1967) pp. 58-69. For purposes of economy I shall treat Professors Madden and Hare as one substance, Madden, being two persons in one unholy binity. 2 Cf.

Madden writes as if meditation on the claim would induce a "profound feeling" that settles the matter. "The price that is paid for ultimate harmony is too great, ultimate harmony is not worth its cost in human misery." This claim he seems to maintain against the possible existence (not just the gentlemanliness) of any divine causal agency or agents. Any somewhat well-meaning God, or god, it seems - even a limited deity - 5 must madden because of the evil in the (pos- sibly) very limited amount of world Madden knows. Must any possible deity with a possible grain of benevolence madden Madden into cock- sure ontological rejection? If not, what kind, apart from a purely evil one, does he allow at the least to be a faint possibility? It is in dubious logical taste to ask the theist to take the naturalist's case seriously, if the naturalist is too agitated by evil 6 to take any theistic speculation seriously other than pure diabolism. Question II. Do not a great many of Madden's claims about God and Evil presuppose incorrectly that some kind of formal or logical incon- sistency has been established between theistically indispensable proposi- tions about God and Evil? At M.F.E., page 481, Madden tells us he will explain how all the most important of theist's "alleged solutions" to the problem of evil break down. He winds up: "I shall be explicit enough about the other alleged solutions also so that it should be quite clear why I think none of them succeeds. I shall conclude, then, that the problem of evil is insoluble and that this insolubility is a sufficient reason for not believing in any type of theistic God whatever." A year before M.F.E. was published 1 Professor Nelson Pike had pointed out in print that there is no formal or logical inconsistency among these three propositions which he takes to be put forward by Hume's Philo, as an inconsistent triad: 4M.F.E., pp. 488-489. 5 Cf. Madden's "Evil and the Concept of a Limited God," Philosophical Studies, Vol. XVIII (1967), pp. 65-70. 6 Cf. Madden's words at M.F.E., page 487, about himself in a froth when of- fered a dim defence of Buchenwald. That the defence offered by the particular individual was dim does not show that far greater good could not come even from such tragic evil. 7 Nelson Pike, "Hume on Evil," Philosophical Review, Vol. LXXII (1963); reprinted in Pike's anthology God and Evil (Englewood Cliffs, 1964) at pp. 85-102.</page><page sequence="3">MUST GODS MADDEN MADDEN? 453 (1) The world contains instances of suffering. (2) God exists - and is omnipotent and omniscient. (3) God exists - and is perfectly good. (p. 87) To produce genuine logical strain among these three beliefs we need already to be sure that some such proposition as the following is true. (6) An omniscient and omnipotent being would have no morally suf- ficiently reason for allowing instances of suffering. (p. 89) To make Pike's argument about Philo tighter we need to add "and perfectly good" after "omnipotent" in (6). To make Pike fully relevant to Madden, insofar as Madden is arguing against all "omni-" -labelling theists,8 we need perhaps simply to replace "suffering" in (1) and (6) by "physical and moral evil." Insofar as Madden is tilting at what he calls "any type of theistic god whatever," we have such a vague, poly- morphous set of possibles on our hands that it is very hard to be sure what would or would not be relevant. If Madden really wants to attack all possible theists he must argue among other things that the following propositions are logically incompatible. (A) All or many of the events we tend to attribute to inanimate nature are due to some unbelievably powerful personal agency or agents, interested in our lives. (B) Among and behind the different sorts of events we experience there are cases of physical and moral evil. Clearly (A) and (B) are not prima facie logically incompatible, nor does it even strike me as improbable or hard to believe that both could be true together. For Madden to have any chance of an argument we must narrow down the field very severely and rather arbitrarily of what qualifies as "any theistic god whatever." To do this we add: (C) There is at least one such unbelievably, powerful personal agent that is worthy of men's worship. But here again a form of Pike's point is sorely applicable. In order to produce a rational tension between beliefs in (A), (B), and (C), we need to be sure of. some things like these: (D) A being worthy of worship could have no morally sufficient reason for allowing any moral or physical evil. (E) A being worthy of worship would necessarily be able and be forced by his very nature ever successfully to prevent the existence of any-thing whose existence he would have no morally sufficient reason for allowing. 8 I.e., supporters of a God who is omniscient, omnipotent, all good, etc.</page><page sequence="4">454 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH It may be possible to prove (D) and (E) but at any rate Madden has not done so. Nor does it appear to me likely that he can do so or that anyone can - not even if one stipulates that the relevant sort of "theistic god" is to be purely of the omniscient and omnipotent variety.9 The greater the god the harder it is for us to judge his possible reasons! Madden might reply, if one may go by the opening paragraph of M.F.E., that the onus is on the theist to spell out a solution to the problem of evil. But is it really self-evident that any such onus is on the theist? Madden thinks so because he thinks the "omni-" -labelling theist must admit that he is prima facie in trouble about "logical compatibility," must admit "the existence, prima facie at least, of gratuitous evil." But the upshot of the Pikean and neo-Pikean arguments which we considered is that skeptics who insist on such 'musts' and also theists who allow these to be foisted on themselves are (prima facie at least!) the victims of a serious logical error. Madden writes at D.E.P.E., page 62: "The problem of prima facie gratuitous evil is clearly not a problem forced upon theism from an external frame of reference that has different con- cepts of evidence and reasonableness. It is a problem wholly indigenous to the religious frame of reference and requires a re-examination of basic concepts within that system." But the proper answer to this sort of question begging is a series of questions. What sorts of theism are really vulnerable to any such problem? Does it follow that because some theists think themselves vulnerable they all really are vulnerable? For where, where is the formal contradiction? Does it follow that, because the existence of evil is part of some religious frameworks of reference, a frightful philosophical problem about evil besets any rational believer in any sort of god? Is it not likely that many of the theists who think themselves so beset have been backsliding out of that frame of reference in one or both of two alien directions - to wit (a), dabbling too deep in impersonal Hellenistic abstractions of perfections 10 that fit ill with the concept of a god as a personal agent (b), drifting into extremes of anthropomorphism whence it seems that if an ordinary human being could have no morally sufficient reason for allowing something, then no personal agent whatsoever could have one? Thus one type of intelligent theist might say that within his religious frame of reference talk of "the problem of evil" is misleading. There 9 Cf. Pike, pp. 88-89 and pp. 98-99; also A.

(It does not follow that he would be callous if his approach should be of a detached intellectual kind.) He might for example, want to achieve a relative advance in under- standing why a powerful and worship-worthy God would create or tolerate this kind of world. He might wish through argument to relieve people like Madden and Ivan K. of their obsessive feeling that the world must be too bad for there to be any worship-worthy God or gods. He might add the following sorts of questions for Madden which I sketch but briefly. Question Ill. If certain physical and moral evils appear gratuitous to some naturalists, are not all or most of them, as Plato seems to hold in Republic, Book X, easily explainable by reference to a doctrine about transmigration and free-will? 11 Question IV. Whatever the defects and sufferings of actually or poten- tially rational persons who exist, do not their very existence and possibili- ties offer strong prima facie evidence that there is at least one benevolent cosmic person at work? Question V. Whatever the failings of many theistic institutions and spokesmen - which are perhaps what really madden Madden most - is it not the case that many believers 12 and theistically inclined agnostics are just as reasonable, tolerant, democratic, socially concerned, empiri- cally minded, etc., as the wiser sorts of skeptics and atheists? And cannot many more theists, agnostics, skeptics and atheists be improved in these directions through philosophers' showing that there are unlikely to be any knockdown arguments either way? Cannot this be so, although reasonable discussion and fruitful disagreements about God and gods remain possible? JOHN KING-FARLOW.
