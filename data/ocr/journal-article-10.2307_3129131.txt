HAHN, Secretary-Treasurer (Wayne A. R. Leys, of the Committee on Auditing, reported that as of May 5, 1950 the "accounts are in good order and are reconciled with bank balance and checks on hand.") D. W. Gotshalk was elected president by acclamation. For Vice-President the Nominating Committee nominated Richard McKeon, Philip B. Rice, and W. H. Werkmeister; and Richard McKeon was elected to this office. According to the rules adopted in 1948, he will succeed to the presidency a year hence. Lewis E. Hahn was nominated for Secretary-Treasurer and was elected. Van Meter Ames was nominated for member of the Executive Committee and was elected. The Division voted to continue to cooperate with the Committee on In- formation (Vacancies and Available Personnel) and authorized payment of its share toward the expenses of the Committee. The Division voted to continue the Newsletter for another year under the editorship of Willis Moore and voted its thanks to Professor Moore for the fine job done this year. After hearing the report of the Publications Committee, the Division voted to accept the Executive Committee recommendations that the Division pledge to pay to the revolving fund of the Publications Committee $100 when and as funds permit. In connection with publications, it should be noted that hence- forth the Proceedings are to be published separately rather than in the Philos- ophical Review and that members should check to make sure that their respec- tive university libraries receive copies of them. After a good deal of discussion, the Division voted to support in principle the plan approved by the Eastern Division last December for reorganizing the American Philosophical Association but expressed the hope that a reorganiza- tion proposal on which all three divisions can agree can be worked out. In view of the fact that next year Northwestern University is celebrating its centennial, the Division voted to accept its invitation to meet there May 3, 4, and 5, 1951. The Division voted to welcome the newly organized Western Conference on the Teaching of Philosophy to meet at the same place and to assist it in securing facilities for a meeting a little ahead of our regular meetings. The Southwestern Philosophical Conference application for divisional status was tabled for further study of the mutual advantages and disadvantages for the Western Division and the Conference of making such a change. The following memorial notices were presented: DeWitt Henry Parker, 1885-1949.

Although his last years were spent in Palo Alto, California, where he was still active in promoting the cause of philosophy and the social sciences both through correspondence with influential people and by means of articles in popular magazines, his life work must be identified with the Middle West and specifically with Iowa. Born on a farm in New Hampshire in 1857, Professor Patrick gained acquaintance with the Middle West during four years of undergraduate studies at the State University of Iowa. In these years (1874-8) the State University of Iowa was definitely a pioneering venture in higher education, and no doubt something of the challenge of bringing cultural stimulus and specifically of philosophical inquiry to students who had so little in the way of intellectual opportunity must have entered his blood at this time. After three years devoted to mining ventures in Colorado, Professor Patrick entered the Yale Divinity School. After three years of graduate study at Yale he entered Johns Hopkins University where he came under the influence of G. Stanley Hall, under whose guidance he received his Ph.D. in 1888. The year previous to this he had accepted a call to return to his Alma Mater as Professor and Head of the Department of Mental and Moral Science and Didactics, later to be known as the Department of Philosophy and Psychology. Thus we find even before the last decade of the nineteenth century that a psy- chological laboratory and a graduate seminar in psychology were introduced to Iowa through the leadership of G. T. W. Patrick. Although the work in psychology was later taken over by Carl E. Seashore, Patrick always retained interest in the subject, publishing books and articles showing a psychological bent almost to his last years. Moreover, Professor Patrick's scientific interests were not restricted to psychology. As those who have used his introductory textbook are aware, he was interested in exploring the relations of philosophy to science generally and advocated that the philosopher should keep in close touch with scientific developments. This was an innovation in the Middle West, where the traditional connection had been between philosophy and religion. His impress in this respect upon the development of philosophy at Iowa is still felt. Although the importance of Professor Patrick's writings is not to be underestimated (he was the author of seven books and the translator of another, as well as having some fifty-seven articles and reviews to his credit), it is as a teacher that he probably made his most lasting impression. Although it is more than twenty years since he was engaged in active teaching, evidences of his effectiveness in that capacity are still available at Iowa. Philosophy in the Middle West owes a great debt to the pioneering labors of G. T. W. Patrick. EVERETT W. HALL The following resolutions, which were approved in virtually the same form by the Eastern Division, were introduced and adopted by vote of the Western Division: 1. WHEREAS the democratic operation of our Association entails equality of treatment for all members, which is not provided by meetings at places where there is racial segregation; BsE IT RESOLVED THAT meetings of the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association not be held at colleges or universities where it is impossible to provide non- segregated accommodations. II. WHEREAS it is the professional responsibility of philosophy teachers to seek and teach the truth; and 96</page><page sequence="5">PROCEEDINGS WHEREAS there has been increasing pressure in many areas against minority or dissenting opinion; and WHEREAS this pressure operates in institutions of higher education to prevent free inquiry into unpopular opinions and to use of the criterion of conformity in judging teachers; and WHEREAS the development of uniformity of thought enforced by legal or economic penalties or intimidation would make it impossible for philosophers to fulfill their professional duties; BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association reaffirm the professional duty and the right of philosophers to examine and express their independent evaluation of any form of philosophical thought whatsoever, no matter what the bearings of that philosophy on controversial issues of social policy. III. WHEREAS the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Association by unani- mous vote adopted the following resolutions and instructed its secretary to transmit it to President Raymond B. Allen of the University of Washington: "That the members of the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Association express their con- fidence in the integrity, as man and teacher, of Professor Herbert J. Phillips of the Department of Philosophy of the University of Washington, and affirm their strong conviction that membership, or non-membership, in a legal political party is not itself sufficient grounds for determining fitness for academic employment." (Proceedings of the American Philosophical Association, 1948-49, pp. 477-78) BE IT RESOLVED THAT the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association endorses the principle that an individual teacher be judged in terms of his own actions and not in terms of the action of others. BE IT FURTHER RESOLVED THAT the Western Division of the American Philosophical Association call upon the University of Washington to reconsider its decision in the case of Professor Phillips in the light of this principle and of the expressed judgment of those of his professional colleagues best qualified to pass on his profsesional integrity. Last year the following resolutions were referred to the Executive Commit- tee for further study: (1) "The Executive Committee is directed to receive in- formation regarding cases of alleged violation of academic freedom, and to be of such assistance as possible in helping members to retain their positions or to secure new positions"; and (2) as a substitute for (1), "The Executive Com- mittee is empowered to investigate any cases of violation of academic freedom, to cooperate with other organizations in making such investigations, and to report facts and recommendations to the division." After making a study of these resolutions and noting that the Eastern Division had voted down a motion to set up an investigating committee on Academic Freedom, the Executive Com- mittee reported that constituting itself a clearing house or investigating com- mittee under these circumstances would constitute an unnecessary duplication of the activities of the American Association of University Professors and might embarrass the latter to our mutual disadvantage. It therefore reported that, though it favored offering such assistance as it could to members under attack on the score of academic freedom, it seemed inadvisable at present to set itself up as an investigating committee. The division voted to accept the report. The following resolution was adopted by unanimous vote: "Be it resolved that the Western Division express and record its deep appreciation of the hos- pitality of the University of Minnesota on the occasion of the forty-eighth meet- ing of the division, and that the division further express and record its appre- ciation of the work of the local committee on arrangements."
