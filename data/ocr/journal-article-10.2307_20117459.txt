<plain_text><page sequence="1">MIRIAM FRANCHELLA LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE: HEYTING'S REFLECTIONS ON SOLIPSISM ABSTRACT. This paper presents the content of the unpublished notes that the Dutch mathematician Arend Hey ting wrote in different periods of his life on solipsism and that are preserved in Heyting's archive at the University of Amsterdam. Most of the notes are quoted here and translated into English. Their study shows the originality of Heyting's reflections on a subject that was typical of his master, L. E. J. Brouwer, the father of intuitionism. Arend Heyting is well known, not only for his own contributions to intu itionism, but also for his expository efforts to make Brouwer's ideas more accessible and more widely known. His construction of an intuitionistic formal system is said to have drawn the attention of mathematicians away from the essential core of intuitionism, towards a merely formal aspect, and Heyting regretted this consequence. Nevertheless, his contribution to intuitionism was not just an explanation or continuation of Brouwer's work but a reappraisal based on the revision of its content: Brouwer approached the subject from a mystical point of view, which considered staying in the inner Self as the only possibility for man to achieve happiness. Hence, he condemned all moves towards the outer world, including mathematics, since it was considered to be a science and language and both of these are directed outwards. In order to "save" mathematics from this ethical point of view, Brouwer redefined it as a languageless activity which has to be developed entirely within the Self; on this basis he established that mathe matical entities are mental constructions and that "true" means "evident", "constructable in the mind". Furthermore, he maintained that mathematics has to avoid the use of symbolic language in its expressions, since commu nicating implies persuading and symbolic language is too "cold" for this aim. Heyting, on the other hand, tried to convince other mathematicians of the acceptability of Brouwerian intuitionism by separating its mystic philosophy (seen as bizarre) from its basic concepts for mathematics. He asserted that the latter simply based mathematics on human abilities and that, therefore, their admissibility is clearly understandable and can be grasped by anybody. The practice of intuitionistic mathematics does not require any choice in favour of one philosophy or another. This approach Synthese 105:207-251,1995. ? 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers. Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">208 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA is very different from Brouwer's. Furthermore, Heyting, by continuing his reflection on the role of language, established that Brouwer's strong rejection of the use of symbolic language was just a question of taste and did not touch the essence of his intuitionistic position. Only the fact that mathematics is a mental activity which does not need language for its development, that language serves merely to communicate (that is to persuade other people) and hence needs emotional means in order to reach its aim, is intrinsic to the intuitionistic position. He then modified this opinion, realised that a languageless mathematics is an idealisation, and concluded that the three foundational schools could no longer maintain their proposals in their absolute form, as they have revealed themselves to be parts of what is called mathematics. It is possible to discover this same attitude of Heyting towards re evaluating previous changes in the notes he wrote on solipsism, preserved in his archive in Amsterdam. Here, as in the above mentioned cases, Heyting defends a subject typical of Brouwer, but he makes it precise and completely redefines it. His characteristic modifications are marked by and based on his deep belief in co-operation and communication between the human beings. The subject of solipsism had been considered many times by Brouwer and was in a sense typical of his closed personality; it was also one of his most problematic ideas. When he was seventeen, on the occasion of his profession of faith, he had began by saying that there is no reality outside consciousness and that images are the only true existing phenomena, and they come from God. However, this position was not adopted in Leven, kunst en mystiek: he did not write either that God provides him with the images or that his own self is the only reality. Later, in 1948, he specified the theoretical impossibility for a person to be sure of the existence of other "minds". Namely - as Heyting himself in his 1968 summary of Brouwer's thought wrote - a "mind" is a perception of sensations (and not a perception of perceptions of sensations). If a knowledge of other minds were admitted, a mind of second order, which perceives perceptions of sensations, would have to be introduced. This would imply the existence in each person of an infinite chain of minds of higher orders. Furthermore, each person would perceive also the perception that another person has of the mind of a third person, and so on. These forms of "regressio ad infinitum" are nonsense for Brouwer. He also adds that the plurality of minds would have as a consequence the ascribing of a mind to animals as well. The result is a theoretical solipsism, which led Brouwer to the conclusion that there can be no exchange of thought. Yet, this position was mitigated by his affirmation that: "Only through the sensation of the</page><page sequence="3">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 209 other's soul sometimes a deeper approach is experienced". It seemed as if Brouwer had only a theoretical solipsism, which was accompanied by a "living" experience of other people. However, this theoretical solipsism was reinforced by the idea of the great difficulty of communication and threw a shadow over Brouwer's work, because they were hard to accept. Heyting underlined that this aspect was absolutely irrelevant for intu itionistic mathematics, but in the last years of his life he reconsidered solip sism. There is no explicit reference to Brouwer, not even to Griss' idealism, with which he was also surely familiar: all of this had been "absorbed" by Heyting and formed the background for his reflections. Their outcome is a series of notes, written in some notebooks (and hence following a time sequence), which are collected in his archive in Amsterdam under the code "Ex". Description of the Material The following describes the material on which this is strictly based; the description follows the inventory of the Heyting Nachlass made by A. S. Troelstra. Group F. Philosophical notes (Filosofische Aantekeningen) Ordering of the material. The material has been written on paper of variable size and provenience, e.g., on the reverse sides of announcements of the Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen, course notes, sheets from a diary, exercise books etc. The tools of writing are varied as well: stylo, pencil, ballpoint, a fineline felttip-pen. Most of the material was found in a red wrapper which bore the inscription "Filosofie". The material of this wrapper is divided into groups F1/18. What has been grouped together was found held together by a paperclip, a common wrapper, or represents an exercise book, or formed a single group because the sheets were quite obviously part of a single sequence. Fl-1/6. 6 folio sheets, written in ink, on the backs of hectographed exercises. Presumably dating from the period 1930-1940. F2. A single lined leaf with on both sides writing in rather faint pencil. Presumably also from the period 1930-1940. Heading: (definitie) begrip "gewaarwording". F3-1/5. Five pages numbered with a red pencil top left, numbers encircled, with a heading "Solipsism" on the first page. The first page is dated 22-VI-1978, on the last page a date 26-VI-1978 occurs. In blue ballpoint on the backs of announcements, letters; paper not lined. F4-1/6. Six sheets, numbered A1-A6 at the bottom in blue ballpoint. The first five are small lined sheets from a notebook, the last is a lined leaf from a larger notebook. The text is written in blue and black ballpoint and pencil. They bear headings in blue "Alg. Pol." (we are not certain of the reading of this heading) the first bears a date 25-VI-1978, the third and fourth 15-VI-1978, the sixth 31 -V-1978. F5. An exercise book with lined sheets and a brown cover. The notes have dates in the margin and run from 4-VII-1978 till 21-3-1980. F6-1/13. Some sheets of which the first bears the heading "Over solipsisme". Presumably written in preparation of a talk on the "filosofiedag"to be held at the Centrale Interfaculteit,</page><page sequence="4">210 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA Erasmus Universiteit Rotterdam, 20-IX-1980. In the invitation for the "f?losofiedag"it is stated that every participant announcing a talk is obliged to prepare an abstract of at least 150, at most 200 words for a programme booklet. The talks had a maximum duration of 20 minutes. The sheets come from lined notebooks, the back contains letters from students, notes for courses etc. The text is written with a fine felttip-pen. The first page is marked zero. The two pages marked PI, P2 are obviously intended as abstract for the meeting. In the margin "100", "200" to keep track of the number of words used. The fourth page is headed "Noten", a fifth page contains a reference only. Then follow three pages numbered I, II, III in top right. A final leaf is headed "Angst voor solipsisme" bears a red " 1 " top left, and looks like the beginning of an essay on the theme, but contains only four lines. F6-11 till F6-13 is the invitation to the "filosofiedag". F7-1/12. Two sheets from a diary marked FI, F2, containing some notes in blue ballpoint under 7-9 May, 14-15 May (not the date of the notes!). Then follow ten sheets numbered top left, written on blue ballpoint, the first on a piece of yellowed paper, the others on the backs of announcements. The first of these starts with: "zie agenda 7-15 mei". F8-1/33. Papers collected in a wrapper with inscription "Genummerde Aantekeningen". There are a wrapper plus 32 sheets, numbered in black at the top left: 1/6, 7A/B, 8, 9A/D, 10A/E, 10F1, 10F2, 10G/J, 11, 12, 13A/B, 14/19. Paper in various sizes, sometimes from lined notebooks, backs of various announcements etc. Text in blue ballpoint. F9-1/9. A group of sheets starting with a narrow strip of paper (part of the back of a calendar leaf), followed by some sheets with notes on the transition from experience to science/mathematics. The notes refer, via dates, to F5. The narrow strip is not numbered, then follow, numbered in back, encircled, top right 1, 2, 3, 31, 4,41, 5, 6. The paper of 1-5 is lined notebook paper, the backs of which have been used before; the last leaf is the back of a printed letter, unlined. The text is written with a fine felttip pen. F10. A single leaf "Uitbreiding van de betekenis van bestaan", dated 21-VII-1979. Blue ballpoint, back of an announcement of the KNAW. Fll-1/8. Eight sheets the first of which has a heading "Over het woord bestaan". These notes are written on the back of announcements of the KNAW, and must be of a date later than 2-V-1980 since this is the date on the back of one of the sheets. They are written in blue ballpoint on the backs of announcements etc., and marked in the top right "Bestaan 1, 2,..., 8". F12. Exercisebook representing a list of contents integrating F5 and F8. F13. A single leaf with an excerpt from a publication of Dijksterhuis (on the back of an announcement of a colloquium of 7-1-1980). Blue ballpoint. F14-1/2. Two sheets from a small-size lined writingbloc, in blue ballpoint, with excerpts from Malcolm, 'Wittgenstein on the Nature of Mind', W. P. Oliver, 'A Sober Look at Solipsism', J.

Gallie, 'Solipsistic and Social Theories of Meaning'. Five pages on three sheets of a lined notebook, numbered 1-5 top right, black ballpoint. F17-1/13. A bundle of sheets in a wrapper marked "Literatuur". Most of these are marked with a black "L". There is a summary of J. L. Austin, How to do Things With Words, and a number of other sheets where Heyting wrote down titles and authors of relevant publica tions. F18-1/3. A typed summary of Russell, Human Knowledge (three pages).</page><page sequence="5">LIKE A BEE ON A W1NDOWPANE 211 Not in the wrapper marked "Filosofie": F19-1/3. Xerox copy of three pages in English, under the heading "Does an external world exist?" Written by Heyting for his daughter-in-law, Mrs Heyting-Johnson, after a philo sophical discussion in September 1979. F20. Typed transcript of Fl/19. F21. A lined exercisebook with brown covers, containing miscellaneous remarks on math ematics, philosophy, abstracts of novels, etc. First there is a sketch of his general ideas on the subject: a three-page summary, but containing a complete description of his fundamental ideas. It is followed by many disparate refinements and further reflections. After writing them down, Heyting looked for the literature on the subject (the only authors he had mentioned had been Descartes and Heraclitus); and each new book brought with it some further references, which he often transcribed. There are many notes referring to his readings: comments on opinions different from his own, and justifications supporting his opinions. There are also some interrupted drafts of articles on the subject and many attempts at ordering his notes according to the main themes concerning the subject. It is therefore possible to reconstruct his thought along the lines that he himself suggested, enriched and completed through his reflections on the literature. 1. A FIRST SURVEY At the very beginning he specifically states that all knowledge is relative, because we do not experience individual things originally, but the pure content of consciousness which is - both for human beings and for all other animals - a total indefiniteness: not even the Self is distinguished from the rest of existence. This content is more or less rich according to the level of the animal on the scale of evolutionary development. An animal of a lower level has very few impulses to govern. It can live simply by means of a mechanism of automatic, instinctive response to them. On the contrary, in man consciousness is so rich, intricate and intense that he could not survive if he experienced it for a long time. Therefore, man needs some form of protection in order to survive. Hence, Heyting believes in this case that animals have no individuated Self and justifies their difference from man by the fact that the man has a richer content of consciousness to "dominate". (However, it is only from the study of lower animals that we can infer what the content of consciousness is: an amorphous mass.) This produces too strong an emotion: therefore, it has to give way to a lot of weaker ones. Still, the strong emotion, the ?xtasis, is a very good basis on which to go on living: one would like to enjoy forever that extraordinary sensation of beauty and harmony. Once it is no longer present, a substitute</page><page sequence="6">212 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA for it has to be found, a new source of strength, which can be found in reason. It is very important to know something about the content of pure con sciousness, because the first certain departure point for all our knowledge is what happens within us: this is Descartes' lesson. In this sense, Heyting specifies the "cogito, ergo sum": the "cogito" is the totality of conscious ness, its entire life (reasonings, emotions, sensations). It is very difficult to "hear" its voice, to "see" its vision, because it is "covered" by habits. It is surely the case, for example, that we introduce into it spatialization and/or temporalization so as to put some order in it. We can guess that there is no spatialization in pure consciousness, because we also have sen sations, like hunger, thirst, taste and smell, which do not have anything to do with spatialization. Or, to be more precise, most human sensations do not. Furthermore, lower animals do not have any kind of spatialization at all; namely, even in order to move oneself, spatialization is not necessary, i.e., it does not either presuppose or imply a consciousness of space, but just a sensation of some change in one's own body: There is a large group of experiences and perceptions, which have nothing to do with the concept of space; among them there are all moods and also perceptions like hunger, taste, smell, etc. A being which does not have any concept of space at all could live despite this; it would he able to be successful or unsuccessful; it could share with humans pain, trouble, happiness, in brief, all feelings. Its instinct would make it carry out the necessary movements in order to take care of the needs of the body without having to represent besides a movement in space. It seems to me, this is the image that we should have of life of the animals of lower levels. One cannot suppose that a polyp, which spreads its tentacles to catch a fish, has a representation of space besides. At most, there are in one way or another links between the need for food, which the creature feels, the stimulus caused by the proximity of a fish, and the contraction of certain muscles during the spread of its tentacles. In higher animals with further needs, the representation of space becomes a more and more indispensable tool in the struggle for existence, and in mammals and birds it is without doubt present to a great extent. Still, they all receive (as men do) their impressions firstly in a non-spatial form. (Fl.l)1 The concept of "movement of one's own body" is independent from the concept of space. It presupposes only perceptions, which the contraction of our muscles gives to us. (F1.2 footnote)2 As for time, Heyting writes: A similar analysis as that which we applied to space can also be applied to time; it is left to the reader as an exercise. (F1.2)3 Pure consciousness, without space and time, is very difficult to explain, because we have to use our daily categories for our description, and these are affected by the fundamental characteristic that is imposed upon con sciousness: individualisation (see later). Therefore, by using them, we can</page><page sequence="7">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 213 only reach an approximate knowledge of the content of pure consciousness, we can only give some hints of it, depriving our consciousness of what we believe to be the structures added to it. Heyting uses a nice metaphor: the content of consciousness is like a very precious, delicate and fragile cloth with a wonderful picture on it: one can see and enjoy it just a moment, then it has to be covered by a heavy, resistant coat of paint, otherwise it disappears (to translate the metaphor: man would loose his life): It is as if I were a fine cloth, but covered by a thick coat of paint so that only coarse folds remain visible. If I manage to remove the coat of paint, the design comes to light, and it is an indescribable design. You cannot define anything finer; its lines have no importance; its development is in itself nothing: still there is in it all the force of the world, all beauty and all emotion. Only its surface is touched by the paint; under the latter it preserves all its beauty. But why cannot it exist out of its covered state? As soon as it is removed, contact with the outer world makes it change its shape and loose its colours so that I speedily cover it again in order to save it from vanishing. (F1.4)4 "Prior" to spatialisation and temporalisation, individualisation takes place: sensations are separated from each other and are distinguished from the Self. Heyting calls the human capacity to keep things separate "reason", while this capacity had been called "intellect" by the idealist tradition and also in Brouwer's papers. The fact that "thinking" means "isolating uni ties" had already been mentioned by Heyting in his previous writings: it was put forward in 1935 (Mathematische Grundlagenforschung. Intuition ismus. Beweistheorie) as a reason why thought in general is mathematical. Namely, "isolating unities" is the essence and origin of all intuitionistic mathematics. Once objects are identified, they need to be linked. This is where spa tialization and temporalization come in, for they are kinds of ordering. The most frequent is temporalization, which permits us to remember: since consciousness knows only the present, rememberings are actual sensa tions which we ourselves place in a past time. As for space, since some representations of sight and taste allow themselves to be inserted in a three dimensional frame and this "works" with respect to surviving, reason tries to generalise this frame. Since also this generalisation works, reason goes on applying it. This is the origin of the procedure of scientific induction. At the end of this initial survey, a methodological remark is called for: as Heyting himself later recognised Methodological remark. One is allowed to use as arguments insights obtained by approximation and also results from the sciences (F5 p. 19)5 he proceeded through reasoning by approximation and by using results from the sciences. He would stick to this method in the following notes,</page><page sequence="8">214 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA where he quotes a lot from books on psychology grounded in biology, neurology, etc. In this way he put together in an original way themes from traditional idealism and biology. Let us now consider his notes further. Firstly, the main large theme: solipsism. He surveys many definitions of solipsism: (1) He read the definitions of solipsism present in Kuiper's Encyclo pedia and quoted only one of them. Namely, Kuiper defined solipsism in general as any doctrine attaching prime importance to the Self. Then he distinguished between three kinds, according to the type of relevance attributed to the self: (a) "egoism" = self-seeking; (b) "reality solipsism" = the Self is all reality; (c) "knowledge solipsism" = the Self is the source of our knowledge. Heyting reported the definition: "The whole world consists only of my representations". Then he presented: (2) a definition of Popper's: "There is also a queer egocentric version of behaviourism which allows consciousness only to the ego: only to oneself, but not to anybody else: a psychistic form of solipsism" (F5 p. 52); (3) an observation by Mountcastle - quoted by Popper-Eccles - that leads to solipsism: "Each of us lives in the universe - the prison - of his own brain . . .". (F5 p. 51). In this respect, Heyting quotes elsewhere (F5 p. 56) a similar idea by Krech and Crutchfield: everybody has his own world, because the "world" is experience, and it depends on our brain, our nervous system and our environment (see later 'Hotel World'); (4) Berkeley's form of solipsism: we know only our ideas (F5 p. 54: he refers to 1.221 of Berkeley's 'Dialogues Between Hylas and Phylonous' and remarks: 'Fine Description of Solipsism');6 (5) Jan Mithoff's attempt to make solipsism more comprehensible by comparing it with autism; (6) Oliver's paper 'A Sober Look at Solipsism' (F 16.3), where the author explains why Descartes' "privacy postulate" leads to solipsism. "Privacy postulate" means: "All that I believe to exist in a world external to myself is actually produced by myself, as dreams are". This postulate had been introduced by Descartes to guarantee himself against mistakes. Yet, a solipsistic conclusion from this premiss can be avoided only by saying that it would go against natural human tendencies to believe in certain things (in an external world). Still, the privacy postulate had been introduced precisely against natural human tendencies to believe in certain</page><page sequence="9">LIKE A BEE ON A W1NDOWPANE 215 things which are mistakes. Therefore, there is no way to avoid solipsism by taking this postulate as one's starting point. (7) Gallie's 'Solipsistic and Social Theory of Meaning', where the author had explained how an incorrect interpretation of analytical psy chology can lead to a solipsistic theory of meaning. Gallie's arguments do not touch directly on analytical psychology, but on the "theory of imagina tion" that it presupposes. According to this theory, we also think by means of images, similar to the absent object and which predispose us to think and behaviour as if it were present. Gallie notes that this theory overlooks the characteristic asymmetry of this likeness-relation: something is present and something is not. This asymmetry always appears in the following four counterexamples to the theory: (1) memory (what kind of images can we have of events that we never saw?); (2) certain properties implied or excluded by the characteristics of a geometrical figure; (3) contradictori ness of a proposition (it gives place not to a delusion, but to a correction: how can we have an image of it?); (4) agreement on the meaning of a sym bol. In fact, our thinking is helped by words, and not only by images, and our thoughts presuppose social reality. Namely, we improve ourselves and we put questions. We usually think of "public objects" (objects which any body could experience). We can communicate, since we describe a "public situation", we explain the modalities of the "experience" and put the stress on a particular sensation (helped by analogy). Then we check the reception of a message by observing the discourses and behaviour of others. [It is interesting to note the fact that Gallie's reference to contradictoriness not as a "delusion" but as a "correction" concerns Brouwer's thought on nega tion. Namely, the latter had defined negation as a construction that ends with a contradiction, a construction that can no longer be continued. Gallie underlines (not directly but from a theoretical point of view) that it is not a disappointment that takes place in the case of contradiction, but rather a correction. Heyting remarks on this observation: How can the imagist theory explain negation? Contradictory images would then have to be thought of within a system, which is considered in itself. But this gives only a feeling of dissatisfaction and no correction of the original image (This is seriousl) [A symbol (as its etymology implies) is essentially a "corrigible" or "reviseable".! (F 16.2)7 (8) Oliver's distinction between "natural solipsism" (= autism and schizophrenia) and "philosophical solipsism". The former is authentic, lived, but absolutely non-analysable, by definition. Although he calls it a hypothesis, it is not a hypothesis in the true sense. Namely, it cannot be called a "hypothesis", as it is something that cannot be verifiable. In fact, anything can be verified either by experience or a priori. It cannot be verified on the basis of experience, because any experience, considered</page><page sequence="10">216 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA external, would confute it automatically; it cannot be proved a priori, i.e., by means of logic, since one cannot even say which kind of logic should be used. Namely, what would be considered a "logic", i.e., a convincing way of reasoning, would be that which is felt "convincing" with respect to oneself. (9) Russell's four possible expressions of solipsism, presented by him in his Human Knowledge (F18.1): (a) dogmatic: "there is nothing beyond data"; (b) sceptic: "one cannot know anything beyond data"; (c) drastic: "everything consists in the following (what I perceive and remember)"; (d) less drastic: "I accept everything that is present in my spirit according both to pure reason and to orthodox psychology; hence also unconscious perceptions". Heyting remarks that these last two positions are expressions of a certain fear of solipsism that many philosophers have. Nuchelmans also presents a form of this fear: Fear of solipsism. Nuchelmans, 'Survey of Analytical Philosophy', (p. 144; F6.8)8 Namely, considering the analytical philosophy of the Vienna circle, he points out that it contains a problem. Since it grounds language in atomical expressions and these on direct perceptions of one's own consciousness, it leads to solipsism, which renders communication impossible. It is this fear that - according to Heyting - sometimes leads philosophers to draw a caricature of solipsism. An example is Russell himself. Summing up his Human Knowledge, Heyting notes that Russell, despite his fear of solip sism, puts at the centre of his theory of knowledge the concept of "belief': a datum is something which we spontaneously believe, and knowledge is an interrelated system of beliefs. This is, for Heyting, a caricature of solipsism, and leads to the impossibility of understanding on what grounds Russell is able to affirm that all these beliefs refer to an external world: Summary. Russell gives a very valuable analysis of the formation of concepts, particularly in the sciences. Still, he remains in two minds concerning the interpretation of the external world. On one side he reduces everything to beliefs in his mind, on the other he supposes that a "belief" is grounded in something outside of it. It remains unclear what precisely is meant by this. The starting point is solipsistic but, after a caricatural form of solipsism has been rejected, it is not clear what is to take its place. (F18.2)9</page><page sequence="11">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 217 2. SOLIPSISM BETWEEN PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY By opposing himself to these kinds of philosophers, Heyting points out that we are naturally led to the belief that we know primarily and for cer tain only our own representations. We have to accept this fact and find a correct theoretical position for it in philosophy. According to his idea described above that this fact is the basis for all knowledge, Heyting shares Jan Mithoff 's idea that solipsism has to remain at the very beginning of philosophy ("solipsism gives prolegomena to any philosophy"). Further more, when he underlines that sentences referring to inner experiences are prior to sentences referring to events, he reports Mannoury's difference between "ik-taal" and "het-taal": The question about the meaning of "existence" is linked to the distinction between "I language" and "he-language" (Mannoury): I can say: "There is a churchtower" or "I see a churchtower". The sense of the latter is a sensation in which the interpretation is included. (F5p.31)10 who was the first to present this distinction. Although the first step of philosophy lies in consciousness, Heyting denies that psychology could help philosophy. The reason is that psychol ogy is already a science, and therefore presupposes the existence of an outside reality. Furthermore, what are considered psychological regulari ties depend only on the culture in which one lives. Finally, the objects of psychology are isolated perceptions and their relations to each other: Psychology searches for the kind of linking between isolated perceptions and their relations to the rest of the content of consciousness. (F8.14)11 Also an analysis of the "unconscious" is not required by philosophy, because "all unconscious knowledge exists only in theory12" (F5 p. 25), since nobody experiences it (F5 p. 26): Two meanings of "I": I have a tootache (1) I have got a match-box (2) In (1) "I" and "conscious" are equivalent, in (2) they are not. (My thought: the same difference exists between conscious and unconscious feelings; the latter exist only theoretically.)13 Instead, Heyting recommends the use of introspection. He states that he had reread a remark of his where he had observed that just as iron is necessary to do research on iron, so the concept of natural numbers is necessary to do research on natural numbers. This remark is useful in that it allows him to present an analogy. Namely, for the same reason, thought (^introspection)</page><page sequence="12">218 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA is necessary to do research on thought, and without any danger of falling into a vicious circle. It can be said that philosophy is grounded in empirical data, if introspection is considered in this way. (F5 p. 26): In a note of 30.08.36 I read 'In order to do research into iron, iron tools are necessary; similarly, the concept of "natural number" is necessary for research into natural numbers. This is no vicious circle in either case, since the natural numbers as building blocks is something different from natural numbers as a concept". Can one say something like that about research into thought by means of thought (introspection)?14 3. IS SOLIPSISM A BELIEF OR A THEORY? Saying that philosophy has to begin with solipsism, is completely different from affirming either "to believe" in solipsism or that solipsism is a theory. Belief in solipsism makes the very manifestation of one's own opinion impossible: namely, communicating something presupposes the existence of an addressee. Also, if a solipsist says "thinking of an outer world is an illusion", he is wrong (and does not express solipsism correctly), because it presupposes at least that we know what an outer world is (or would be): The expression: "thinking of an outer world is an illusion" is not a good expression of solipsism, since it presupposes that there should exist an outer would, or at least that we know what it means. (F8.32)15 As for solipsism, in F8.16 he quotes Wittgenstein: Namely, when the solipsist indeed affirms that only he exists, and nothing besides, then it is effectively possible to carry his theory ad absurdum. (Wittg. 58)16 Heyting also gives a quote from Wittgenstein (through Moore) along these lines: "If a Solipsist says that he has something which another hasn't, he is absurd and is making the very mistake of putting the two statements (T have a toothache' and 'He has a toothache') on the same level". (F.5 p. 26)17 This affirmation of the Solipsist would consist of a production of grammatical nonsense. Even if one affirms solipsism epistemologically, one cannot believe in it, one cannot live according to it. Heyting notes that "theoretical solipsism" is related to daily life as metalanguage is to language: it is obvious that confusing the two leads to contradiction. It may be with this in mind that he underlined and transcribed Moore's quote "... the mistaken opinion that a man sincerely believes that if a thing is doubtful he must doubt it" (F5 p. 22).18 In this connection, Heyting also refers to a quote from Aster about Plato, where the latter puts the question as to whether there is a change in life if somebody becomes more conscious.</page><page sequence="13">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 219 4. THE CONCEPT OF TRUTH On the other hand, according to Heyting, a "theory" requires always a real ity relative to which one can check the truths of the theory: also sceptics presuppose a reality which they cannot know. As Heyting was an intuition ist and accepted the traditional definition of truth, we can suppose on the one hand that he considered mental data as "reality", and, on the other hand, that he believed that truth was traditionally defined as correspondence to a (generic) "reality" (and not specifically to a reality outside men). This theory of truth is - according to him - what distinguishes Popper from Kuhn, whose work is however a refinement of Popper's: One can consider Kuhn's work as an elaboration and a refinement of Popper's. If there is a contrast, then it consists in Popper's realistic consideration that defines truth as accordance of a proposition with facts. According to Kuhn, also facts change during revolutions, or at least the meaning of the terms used. (F5 p.40)19 As for truth, it is also interesting to note that in 8.13 Heyting writes about our conviction of correctness (juistheidsovertuiging), which we have not only about the outer world but also about every one of our assertions (that we suppose true): Truth The conviction of correctness is not limited to the material outer world. I say: "Klaas is a villain", and I mean that it is so. The question whether the outer world really exists, or that I just think it, is meaningless. I think it: that is all that I know.20 There is an inner feeling that assures us that we are right: it may be the same that is required by intuitionism to recognise a piece of evidence. As will be seen at the end of these considerations, these ideas of Heyting do not prevent him from believing that truth is relative, since all distinctions are relative and artificial. In this sense, Heyting affirms that mathematics is the origin of the "lies of discreteness" (F2), just because truth is pure consciousness and this is not individualised: First: furthermore, there is nothing "determinate", "sharp" to be found in it; perceptions flow into each other and do not have an individuality of their own. If we still presuppose determinacy, speak of separate "things", and allow everything to happen in space and time, it is necessary for us to replace the content of our consciousness - consciously or unconsciously - by something else: in other words, we have to act a falsehood, a lie (the lie of the discrete).21 He also remarks that mathematics has nothing to do with experience: this is the novel discovery of the last century - the other is the discovery that traditional physics is not suitable for studying either very small things or very big things (F9.6):</page><page sequence="14">220 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA Brief survey There is a gradual changing of the ordering, which I spontaneously bring into my direct experience, according to scientific principles, with the aim of ordering as much as possible of human experience into a system. The role of mathematical concepts, although present from the beginning, continuously increases during this development. In the last century [two important developments made their appearance]: (1). mathematics [has] freed itself from its link with experience: [it considers the building of autonomous structures as one of its tasks, which experimental science may possibly use] (2). experimental science [has] learnt to see that structures which are best fitted to our direct experience are not sufficient for the domain of both very big and very small things.22 As to the relativity of truth, he reports an observation by Popper (which was already known in philosophy, for instance in Blaise Pascal): there can be no definitive explanation of anything, because every explanation is based on some postulates, which are accepted as such, as ungrounded. In particular, very big questions, like that concerning our existence, can have no definitive answer. (F5 p. 30: "p. 554. Popper about incompleteness of any explanation, also the explanation of 'existence' ".23 As for expla nation, he reports Popper's definition without any comment: for Popper "explanation" means "logical deductions from a general law". (F5 p. 39: p. 349 'What is Explanation?'.24) He tries to give a meaning himself to the word "explanation" (F8.5) and produces two possibilities: Scientific meaning: integrating into an extended structure. Vague meaning: making comprehensible. This often includes an anthropomorphism. For instance: one realises that a bee collects honey in order to feed larvae in the hive. (beehive=frill)25 In this respect, Heyting does not share Popper's definition of "not scientific" = "metaphysic" as a theory which cannot be falsified: "scientific" is for him simply a theory that has relations with science. However, he states that also for Popper the main ideas of these "metaphysical hypotheses" are considered useful in order to obtain a picture of the world which gives suggestions about directions of research (F5 p. 28: "p. 442 Popper about metaphysical hypotheses"26). 5. FROM THE CONTENT OF CONSCIOUSNESS TOWARDS THE OUTER WORLD - FIRST STEP: OTHER PERSONS EXIST The content of consciousness in itself is described sometimes as "thought", sometimes as "cogito" (the two terms are distinguished). In other places he finds the term "cogitatur" more adequate, since there is not as yet any "sub ject" in consciousness. This term had been previously introduced by Griss, Lichtenberg and Russell among others. Heyting reports Moore's quote of Russell about Descartes: "What Descartes should profess to know is not T</page><page sequence="15">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 221 think' but 'there is thinking' " (F5 p. 22). Furthermore, he shows himself familiar with Lichtenberg^ terminology in writing notes on Moore. This latter says that Lichtenberg would have used the expression "cogitatur", and Heyting remarked "It's true!". However, the final expression is "It lives", pointing out that there is as yet no subject and the whole life of consciousness has been considered. If we verify the content of our consciousness, we realise at first that we perceive that other persons exist. Despite this perception, the true solipsist continues in her/his belief, since she/he doubts she/he has constructed it her/himself. The solipsist sees other men, but she/he cannot reach them. Therefore, she/he can be described as a bee on a window-pane (F5 p. 1). Instead, Heyting says that we have to believe in our perceptions, because it is very natural for us to do so. By focusing on our perceptions of other persons, we note that we perceive others as minds and not as bodies. Namely, another person first has contact with us through an exchange of thoughts and through this contact we enrich ourselves: therefore we conclude that other people have a life of feelings and thoughts like our own. This is a sort of logical opposition to Brouwer's 1948 theory: instead of affirming "there are no minds, hence there is no exchange of thought", he says: "There is some exchange of thought, hence there are other minds". However, we must remember that also Brouwer had talked about the possibility of sometimes experiencing others' souls: only, he could not "reach" them theoretically. This is on the part of Heyting a form of argument by analogy about other minds. Usually, an analogy is made between forms of behaviour, leading to the conclusion that other minds exist (see, for instance, Wisdom's Other Minds, which he quotes). Heyting's analogy, on the contrary, is based on the enrichment that we obtain for ourselves and from the outside. He quotes three ways by which one can know the minds of other people: John Wisdom, Other Minds. Oxford 1965. Symposium: other minds (pp. 206-244) Three ideas of "knowing other minds": 1. In usual language: knowing something from certain data; 2. By telepathy. 3. In the same way in which we know our own mind. The third way is really impossible. (F14.1)28 The fact that other people have a mind analogous to our own allows communication: In the fellow-man feeling a representation is contained of a life of feelings and thoughts analogous to mine. Only this makes communication possible. (F6.6)29</page><page sequence="16">222 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA His belief in the spiritual enrichment through other people was typical of Heyting. Since the very beginning of his work in popularising intuition ism, he had written that he wanted to reconcile formalists and intuitionists because collaboration between mathematicians is absolutely necessary to the development of mathematics. He really believed in the possibility and positive nature of collaboration. His writing style, always so clear and attractive, reflects his deep conviction in dialogue, in having a spiritual exchange. In these notes, he also underlines the influence that other people have even in the formation of the image we have of ourselves. Heyting finds in Mithoff support for this opinion: in talking about autistic children, Mithoff asserts they they cannot have a correct idea of themselves, because they are so deeply shut into their own world. However, it is also impor tant to consider further Heyting's remark, which is a logical consequence of spiritual enrichment through spiritual intimacy: strictly speaking, the hypothesis that other people have emotions similar to ours can be affirmed only about the members of our social group, although the mass media are continuously enlarging the concept of social groups: First approximation. I am in the centre of things. There is no sharp distinction between my body and my mind (There is little difference between "I think", "I run", "I am angry", etc.): I find myself in a world of material things, which I perceive. By means of memories I enlarge it to things not directly perceivable. about which I suppose that they exist also if I do not perceive them. Among these things there are other men, about whom I suppose that they have thoughts and feelings analogous to mine. SeeC. The latter holds only for men of my own group. Not long ago workers were considered by the rich as completely different beings, and nowadays many people still think and feel the same about black people. The mass media continuously make groups larger. (F8.10)30 Spiritual contact is the source of our certainty about the existence of other minds. But also the fact that we feel friendship or hate cannot be negated: It is very difficult to free oneself from the thought that there exists an outer world, and to arrive at the idea that this thought is something which is in myself. The same holds for the relationships of friendship and hate. (F5 p. I)31 Heyting was struck by the concept of "identification" between persons as stated by Krech and Crutchfield: it is a common psychological fact that people who live together or frequent each other often consider positive or negative what is useful or dangerous for the other. He underlines in their book also the observations about 'Hotel World' (F5 p. 56: 'Hotel World'):32 each person lives in her/his world as if she/he lived shut up in a hotel room, and knocked on the wall, taking for granted that other</page><page sequence="17">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 223 persons have her/his same meanings and codes. This testifies to our natural belief in the existence of other people, but is sometimes also a cause of misunderstanding: when we ignore the differences between ourselves and others. In particular, everybody has a personal psychological world: what is important for her/him; how many differences between things or persons she/he is able to notice; how open her/his opinions are; how many "regions" she/he has at her/his disposal; how much space she/he has in them; whether she/he is in the middle or at the margins. The assertion that we perceive other people first as minds and only later, if they actually strike us physically, as bodies, is the reverse of that of Griss (and of all those who infer the existence of other minds by comparing their behaviour with that of others). Namely, he started from the evidence of other bodies (as objects among others), recognised in them a behaviour like his own, then through a spiritual intimacy inferred that they also have a mind. Heyting reverses the order: we first experience a spiritual contact and then a corporal one. The fact that we attribute a body to these minds, however, means that spirits and bodies cannot be separated: 8. Spirit and matter are not separate; my fellow-men appear to me also materially. (F3.2)33 The fact that we are intimately sure of the existence of other minds by a form of "empathy" gives rise to the problem that we cannot be sure that animals have consciousness. In this regard he quotes the second Popper Eccles dialogue [where they do not reach an agreement on the question (F5 p. 28)]: 25.1.79. Popper + Eccles, dialogue II. It is difficult to give a clear sense to the question about consciousness of animals. I perceive my own consciousness and I know that of other men by a form of sympathy, but I cannot have any representation of consciousness in other beings. I know consciousness only from introspection. In order to know if a dog has consciousness, I should be able to put myself in his place.34 In this dialogue, consciousness of one's own death is considered a criterion by which to judge whether an animal has self-consciousness or not. Later, Popper35 reconsidered the theme of death, and specified that the possibility of eternal life would frighten him. In particular, he would find eternal life as a state of semi-ghost a terrible prospect. He believed that it is precisely death which gives meaning to life, which gives it value. Heyting refers to this opinion and underlines it. 6. SECOND STEP: THE OUTER WORLD EXISTS We also have another kind of certainty: that the outer world exists. It is no more than a certainty; we cannot prove the existence of the world,</page><page sequence="18">224 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA because this would require that we knew what it is: we would already have to possess a representation of it. Heyting adds that Moore's proof (which consisted of raising his hands) has to be considered from this point of view: A proof of the existence of the outer world will necessarily include a vicious circle, because it begins with the supposition that "outer world" means something, and that concept includes in itself that of existence. Analysing Moore's proof from this point of view. However, Moore felt that a proof was necessary. (F5 p. 16)36 In this sense he criticises naive realism (in particular that of Russell), because it presupposes that we know what an "autonomous" existence of objects means. However, he remarks that every philosophy oscillates between solipsism and naive realism. It is wrong to affirm that "an outer world exists" means "we order sensations in that form", since (1) not all of spiritual life refers to an outer world (hence, not all our sensations are ordered in that form); (2) by saying "we", we presuppose other people, therefore presuppose what we want to show: 31.5.78 "An outer world exists". Does it mean more than the fact that we order our perceptions in the form of an outer world? This appears to be efficacious. On the basis of the theory of evolution one may suppose that it was precisely through evolution that we got to this method of ordering. This consideration is one-sided and contains a petitio principii. It is one-sided, since it is far from the truth that our spiritual life is related to an outer world. The petitio principii consists in "we". Our fellow-human has a very special place in our spiritual life. (F4.6)37 We believe in the existence of the outer world, because it is one of the representations that we have in our consciousness. Certainty (or surety) is mixed with a sense of challenge and threat in the same feeling, and this feeling is interpreted by us as a sign of the existence of the outer world: (4) Content of consciousness, moment of life, life of thoughts and feelings? Each word suggests an unintended interpretation. There is no trace either of space or of time. Very complicated and unordered. There are no distinct data in Russell's sense. What matters is the experience of the repre sentation of the outer world. Some complexes of perceptions are coloured in a certain way, are coupled with a feeling, which I call "feeling of the environment"; it contains a feeling of safety but also a threat and a challenge to act. What this feeling awakes in me I interpret as a sign of the outer world, as placed outside of myself. (F6.5)38 It is this certainty which was called a 'Lebensform, etwas Tierisches' by Wittgenstein in his '?ber Gewissheit' (F4.5).</page><page sequence="19">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 225 7. A MODEL OF THE WORLD This certainty is characterised by the fact that one does not expect sudden changes in reality, but only gradual variations. We construct a certain general idea (a model) of the world that produces certain expectations, and we believe that this is reality. This "model" (or "system") is "less fixed than the Kantian": But the further question: "Do objects also exist when I do not perceive them?" lies at another level. It asks for the system, within which we order all our perceptions. This system is fixed in its main lines, but much less fixed than Kant thought. In our daily life we know neither a Euclidean space nor a homogeneous time. (F8.25)39 Heyting also quotes Mannoury on this topic. Namely, the fact that men behave according to a structure of expectations and memories was a subject dear to Mannoury, and this structure is the very model at issue. Belief in the model is reinforced by society: Why am I convinced of the existence of Japan? Well, because I have been taught so at school and I imagine that some men there perceive things as I myself perceive my environment. Here intersubjectivity is going to play a big role. (F7.11-12)40 Society is determinant in preserving self-identity in general (F5 p. 56: 'Identification. Interesting for the concept 'other men").41 He also remarks that it is impossible for him to free himself from what he had learnt at school (F12 p. 1: "16.9.78. It is difficult for me to free myself from the theories I learnt at school").42 The model is what allows us to distinguish between dreams/phantasy and reality: what does not fit into this model is not real. Heyting adds Popper's observation that we easily forget dreams because they do not fit into the structure of the world that the Self possesses (F12 p. 1 : "16.9.78 Phantasy and dream versus reality").43 As we can see, the usual psycho analytic assertion about the filter with which consciousness selects data is used here to prove that there is a structure which we impose upon pure consciousness. (As for dreams, note that Heyting quotes Moore's criti cism of Russell's objection to the possibility of distinguishing between dream and reality. Russell had said that during a dream we remember facts that never happened. Moore replied to the objection by affirming that it is a problem of wrongly reporting the facts. Namely, it hinges on our saying: "We remembered" instead of specifying: "We dreamt of remem bering". Heyting observes that Moore confused a dream and the report of a dream: what was important for Russell was the fact that sometimes, that is during a dream, we believe in something unreal.) As for the difference between phantasy and reality, Heyting quotes Krech and Crutchfield on the difference between perceptions, which are present, and images, from</page><page sequence="20">226 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA the memory and created. People have different way of forming images and images with different degrees of intensity. In general, images are less vivid but more fluid (one can combine them as one likes). Still, we are not always able to distinguish between images and perceptions. (F5 p. 56, "368. Distinction between perception and image".)44 The existence of the model also explains why after-images are not conceived as spatial objects: because they do not fit into the model: 27.10.78 In connection with G. E. Moore, Proof of an external world. Why is an after-image not a spatial object? Moore says: because another person cannot see it. I say: because it does not fit into the organisation of our experience. (F5 p. 22)45 (Moore had written about after-images in order to criticise Kant's idea of outer world as "met with in space", underlining that after-images and double-images are not met with in space, but just present in space.) Popper's model corresponds to what Heyting calls the ordering of the world. Yet, it is interesting to observe that Popper had underlined that our expectations have to be conceived as something r?visable. They exist only to be submitted to further proofs, and we are sure that, sooner or later, they will be shown to be incorrect and require modifications to the theory. In this sense, Popper stated that no belief in "uniformity of nature" can exist and hence Hume's position, which bases induction on a belief in repetition in nature, is wrong: we must not wait for confirmations, but we have to be ready to change our ideas. However, he admitted that he, as a person, believes in induction (but not as a philosopher). Heyting remarks that in this way Popper had not explained induction: 28.2.80 Popper's solution of Hume's paradox says nothing. The question remains the same: Why does the theory that explains past experience best also explain future experience best? (F5 p. 37)46 Heyting reports Hume's argument in defence of induction: both babies and animals have it. Namely, they learn from experience by generalising. Hey ting distinguishes (F5 p. 31) between this direct "psychological" induction and scientific induction: Direct, psychological induction, which Hume attributes to habits, is different from scientific induction. The latter participates in the systematic order of experiences.47 In F 18.1 he mentions Russell's explanation of induction, which is the same that he proposed at the beginning of his notes: induction is used since our survival depends on it, and it is something spontaneous and unconscious: Scientific deduction rests on induction. Induction cannot be proved. If one tries to formulate it logically, one always arrives at assertions which are false in many cases. Induction is a</page><page sequence="21">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 227 habit, which belongs to the adaptation to the environment, on which biological survival is dependent. Generalisation as a habit of expectation originates at a lower level than that of conscious thought.48 This "model" explains why we believe in the existence of an object even when we do not perceive it. However, Heyting mentions Berkeley's solu tion to this question: God thinks the objects when we do not perceive them. Furthermore, by reading Dijksterhuis' 'De mechanisering van het wereldbeeld', he learns that St. Augustinus had already described Plato's ideas as thoughts of God: 101. Already Augustinus considered Plato's ideas as God's thoughts, of which things are incomplete realisations. (F13)49 Heyting finds this solution as complex as the question itself. Heyting also writes that the question has no meaning at all: we have this belief, because it is simpler: c. Do things exist also when I do not see them? It is a meaningless question. We make our theory so that this holds, because this is the simplest. (F9.3)50 We say that something exists, when we have this certainty and the things fit into our model of life. Heyting maintains that we directly see a tree, for example we do not see first some "symptoms" that reason then collects together: It may also be an object, which presents itself to me as placed outside of me. I do not conclude this by means of reason on the basis of given data; on the contrary, it is the direct, unreasoned way of observing things. I do not first perceive differently coloured patches and conclude from this that a tree exists, no, I directly perceive a tree and I realise that there is the tree: I perceive it as existent. This awareness of existence consists in a certain coloration of my perception, in a feeling that accompanies it and which I want to call "feeling of being genuine". This feeling of being genuine is thus what I mean by "existence" in the first place. (F7.4-5)51 In this connection, he quotes Berkeley's theory that things are only com plexes of sensations that we summarise into a single word 242. Phil, express himself more or less like this: My senses are affected; there must be something which affects them, but this cannot be anything else than the complex of perceptions of the thing, which is summarised in one word. (F5 p. 54)52 but he does not comment on it. At the very beginning he had affirmed that "body" is a collection of impressions that reason collects together Now reason sets to work. It links these impressions and the former similar ones, which it has already been able to unify into impressions of sight. In the past, after certain movements, similar impressions were followed by touch perceptions, of which reason has again been</page><page sequence="22">228 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA able to collect some under the concept "body". Reason concludes from this that also in this case we could obtain the touch perceptions after certain movements, hence that there exist bodies. And again on the basis of preceding experiences one arrives at the representation of the kind and shape of bodies; the representation consists of imaginary sight and touch perceptions. (F1.5)53 Instead, here Heyting talks of Popper's disagreement with Russell's asser tion against realism that we do not see a stone, but just the effects of the stone upon us. Heyting adds a reason in favour of Popper: speaking of effects presupposes an external reality (of the stone), hence it presupposes the realism it wants to eliminate: 3.12.79 Popper O.K. page 65. The criticism of Russell is correct. Namely, I do not perceive the effects of the stone on myself; this wording presupposes the existence of the stone. (F5 p. 34)54 In order to express that it is a mental activity which puts things "out of the mind", Heyting looks for a word and suggests (with a question mark) "Objective". However, he remarks that our creation of the world is accomplished by a sensation of "correctness": One has to assume as basic the concept of "put outside of me". To find a suitable word. Objective? It has to express the spiritual activity of "putting outside of myself". I shape the world, that which is put outside? This spiritual activity is linked to very strong feelings of correctness. This is again a basic datum, which requires a specific term. (F8.11)55 However, Heyting underlines once again that objects are relative: in par ticular, he remarks on Berkeley's comment about the relativity of the concept of "sameness" (F5 p.54: "240-241. Philonous proves the relativ ity of 'sameness' ").56 Heyting finds traces of this opinion also in Popper and in Krech/Crutchfield. In Objective Knowledge Popper affirmed that there is no "direct experience", but that all our perceptions are somehow pre-oriented: also our sense-organs make their own selection on the given data, because they consider (^transmit) some aspects only of these data. In Unended Quest Popper stated that sense-organs "interpret" data accord ing to a certain way of adaptation: for instance viewing with both eyes interprets distances (F5.22: "About the natural organisation of perception see Popper, Unended Quest ?32 and note 22.3).57 In this regard, Heyting quotes Popper-Eccles about the fact that the meaning of a visual signal seems to be prior to its physical interpretation. As an example, they men tion reading: when we read, we pay attention to the meaning and not to the shape of words. Heyting specifies: Popper-Eccles 481, footnote. When reading, 'The meaning of a word may have priority over its spelling".</page><page sequence="23">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 229 An argument in favour of this is that I often read another word instead of that which is written, because I suppose a certain meaning. (F5 p. 30)58 Popper also said that we cannot speak of "pure experience", because all experience depends on our theorizing (F5 p. 34: "p. 74 under (3). This is an interesting remark about our direct experience"):59 Heyting appre ciates this remark as well as Popper's distinction between perception and observation, according to which observation requires an initial problem, is planned and prepared, although somehow even perceptions presuppose expectation, since we live in a general structure of expectations about the world. Heyting quotes Krech and Crutchfield, where they underline that perception is directed towards "catching" the object, instead of the stimu lus: perception tries to select patterns and not single stimuli (F5 p. 56: "p. 4. 'Separated stimuli' are abstractions").60 A further reference to Krech Crutchfield's book is where they clearly express the idea that our body is made in such a way that it perceives structured data (F5 p. 56: "p. 22. We simultaneously perceive the whole and the part. Structure"):61 perception is organised, selective, and all perceptions are linked to each other within a cognitive structure. The authors present a survey of the organised nature of perceptions: grouping according to continuity, likeness, "good shape", possibility to go on, symmetry, closure, common direction. Each "whole" is conceived as made up of interrelated parts. Thus, we have neither the "tabula rasa" (indication of Popper's pages, where he himself criticises the 'theory of common sense', that is the theory of tabula rasa: F12 p. 5 "pp. 65-66 Criticism of common sense")62 nor "Protokolls?tze" in the proper sense. If one wants to give them a meaning, the only possibility is to consider them as a form of experience where attention is concen trated on a certain particular impression. Also in F8.2 he writes: "It is a misunderstanding that a direct datum can be expressed in 'Protokoll satze' ",63 8. THE SELF Another consequence is that Hume's definition of the Self as a sheaf of sensations is not valid: the Self is not passive, but is active (it is activity) and programs the brain (it is not a part of it) which controls the entire nervous system (Heyting underlines the role of the brain considered here). The Self is a problem-solver: it draws attention to the most relevant things and decides. Heyting also refers to Popper's remark that James's theory of the "stream of consciousness" (=way of linking our subjective experiences) comes from a passive way of observing mind, but in reality it is the state in which we observes ourselves and try to do nothing. Therefore, since we</page><page sequence="24">230 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA make an effort, also in this case we are not being passive (F5 p. 30: "p. 517. Good remark of Popper's about the 'stream of consciousness' ").64 Heyting also quotes Krech and Crutchfield on the stream of consciousness (F5 p. 56: "James' Stream"), where they agree with this concept, since no image is stable in mind but all follow each other continuously. He himself uses this term to characterise consciousness. He says that The content of my consciousness is at each moment enormously complicated. It contains countless sight and hearing perceptions, representations of distances and spatial shapes, feelings of wonder, shock, fear, dislike or happiness, memories, word-images, expectations, etc. It is meaningless to ask whether I indeed experience all this at the same time. The exchange of one impression for another happens very fast (fleeting melody: we perceive each note separately, because we can reproduce the melody). What I become conscious of, is a continuous stream of quickly changing impressions. (F5 pp. 2-3)65 Heyting quotes Popper-Eccles who emphasise that we have the idea of our "Self" as something enduring and that this is useful in order to understand ourselves. (They identify Self and Ego.) It is the possibility of recalling at any moment a fact from the past that determines the continuity of the Self: latent memories, the unconscious, can be recalled into consciousness. This is what Heyting meant when he affirmed In ?38 the debate on the unconscious is interesting, in particular the possibility of making unconscious things conscious. Memory plays a role here. (F5 p. 52)66 Heyting also quotes the definition of "Self " given by Krech and Crutchfield (F5 p. 56: "p. 201 and the following. The concept of Self):61 the Self is an organised and enduring perception. It is a perception that develops and may change considerably. Better, it is an integrated process of perception, emotion and thought. It is different from the "Ego", a term that they use only in Freud's technical-psychoanalytic meaning. The Self is like an onion: it has many layers, some of which are considered more central or better (if they give rise to success), others less central or worse (if they prevent success). The noblest aspects of the Self constitute the "ideal of the Self", which are sometimes not its essential core. In F8.15 he asks "Is it possible to speak about feelings distinguished from the whole of consciousness, without first thinking of an entity?"68 In this regard, his reading of Popper and Eccles's book with Eccles's extremely precise description of the brain led him to have doubts about the possibility that it could be the product of random mutations selected by nature; yet, he read in the same book - a few pages later - the fact that other mammals (like monkeys) have a mechanism of viewing partly similar to man's. This reinforced Heyting's belief in the evolutive hypothesis: 4.1.79 The description of the structure of the brain by Eccles makes again the possibility doubtful that it may have arisen by accidental mutations.</page><page sequence="25">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 231 I see an argument for the evolutive hypothesis in the way in which sight impressions are interpreted. (E2, ? 10, F5 p. 28)69 9. ASPECTS OF THE WORLD The certainty of the existence of an outer world presupposes the existence of other people, because certainty of the existence of the outer world means that we are sure that anybody standing where we are would see what we are now seeing (note that also in this case the relationship with other men is through agreement). Spatial representation is always present in the sensations of one's own body: it is impossible to separate one's own pain from its localisation: 22.11. The body causes me some problems. I feel pain in my big toe. It is impossible to free the feeling of pain from its localisation: as far as my own body is concerned, the representation of an outer world comes first. (F5 p. 24)70 The representation of the outer world is spatialised. A "spatialised world" means a world that is conceived as having three dimensions: objects are at distances from each other, stand in position with respect to each other. Heyting observes that this has nothing to do with Euclidean space, because the latter is "added" by our culture since it works: it is a generalisation of the space-experience - primitive spatial representations were nearer to the naive representation: The ancient representation of the world as limited by the sphere of fixed stars was nearer to the naive representation of space. (Fl 1.2)71 One can wonder at the difference between a product of nature and a product of culture. In both cases something becomes a habit since it works. But in the first case the habit is universal, in the second it is restricted to a group of men. There are no spatial representations without qualities. This is a further ground for the fact that space does not exist per se; and in this regard Heyting quotes a passage from Berkeley's 'Dialogue between Hylas and Philonous': 4.9. Philonous argues that extension (space) cannot be conceived without qualities (176). Therefore, space does not exist in itself. (F5 p. 15)72 As for time, he remarks that it is conceived as homogeneous (F9.2 - see above). He also observes that after one's own death, subjective time no longer exists. Then he puts the question: how can there be time after the material world disappears? But he himself realises that this is a pseudo question</page><page sequence="26">232 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA p. 556. Life after death and eternity. After my death my time will no longer exist. Objective time is a theoretical construction, in which I do not live, also not in a later life. Does that time still pass if the material world disappears? (This is a pseudo-question). (F5 p. 30)73 In addition to objects, emotions, feelings, etc. also exist. The difference between the two kinds of existence is the same as that between "object and predicate (=accidens)": "I experience the world not only as existent but as existent-as-it-is" (FIO).74 There is no difference between primary and secondary qualities in experience: it is added later in theories. When we have non-spatialised sensations, we consider them as inner sensations. This is a first criterion for distinguishing between inner and outer sensations. A further difference between "inner" sensations (like pain, sorrow and love) and sensations about the outer world is that only the latter are shared by other people ("When I was in love with a girl, I did not suppose that everybody was" - F19.3).75 In Fl 1.7 he notes, however, that there is something common between the feeling of pain and that of an outer world: they both exert violence upon us: I. Pain, falling in love, rage "are there". A similarity with the feeling of an outer world is the resistance which these perceptions oppose to the will. Yet, this existence is experienced as clearly different from that of the outer world.76 Furthermore, The feeling of being genuine and the fellow-man feeling are the basis of the distinction be tween matter and spirit. (F3.1 )77 This distinction is made by us and, hence, requires "reflection": The distinction between body and mind is not given initially. I experience my body, my thought and perceptions as a whole. Already for distinguishing between feelings of the body like pain on the one hand and thought on the other, reflection is necessary. (F8.20)78 However, it is impossible to distinguish sharply between our body and mind: there is little difference between "I think", "I run", "I am angry" (F8.10 - see above). The "I" lies in the middle. The "I" is in a world of material things which the "I" perceives. 10. ABSTRACTION Until now we have looked at the belief in the external world. In F8.9 Hey ting maintains (with respect to a quotation from Russell's The Problems of Philosophy) that our belief in an external world is direct and works without</page><page sequence="27">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 233 our being conscious of it. Instead, when we introduce the concept of an outer world, we have to use abstraction: 24. Of course it is not by argument that we originally come by our belief in an independent external world. We find this belief ready in ourselves as soon as we begin to reflect. [But this belief is not something abstract; it is bound to a given situation and functions within this situation, without our being conscious of it. The concept of an "outer world" is already a product of reflection.]79 Therefore, Heyting presents this first ordering: content of consciousness; other minds; outer world; abstraction. Later, he comes back to the subject and affirms: Every man lives in different worlds, corresponding to different levels of language. At each level there exist other things for him, and the word "existence" is used with a different meaning. (1) the immediate environment. Within this, people. (2) representations of the environment and where I can go from there. The levels partially melt into each other. They overlap each other. (3) memories of environments, where I have been before (here the concept of other men plays a role). (4) communications from other people (only at this stage the distinction dream/reality can be made clearly). (5) space-relations among represented environments. (6) syst?matisation of these relations by means of maps and globes. (7) fitting of all structures into a spatial generalisation reaching till infinity. (8) astronomy. (9) microscopically small objects. ( 10) theoretical physics. Particles of a second fraction exist. Here "existence" has all become "fitting into the theory". (F11.5)80 As for abstraction present in the definition of existing things, Heyting specifies that: 3.10.78. Each of our abstract concepts begins with something simple and evident. So does "'existence'": First there are the objects of my direct environment, which exist; last there are stars and mesons. How many steps are there between these and how does the concept change as it passes from one to the other? God, real numbers and large cardinal numbers are at the top of such steps. At which step do the rules for the existential quantifier hold? (F5 p. 20)81 This scale is very similar to the one he had proposed himself in 1947 as "scales of evidence". Namely, replying to Griss' criticism of Brouwerian negation, he admitted that the latter is not completely evident because it refers to hypothetical constructions, and he also added a list of other intu itionist concepts which involved hypothetical, and hence "not completely evident", constructions. Among them he included choice sequences (which are used to define intuitionist real numbers) and large cardinals. Hence,</page><page sequence="28">234 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA what in those papers were called "degrees of evidence" are considered here as "degrees of abstraction", where abstraction is regarded as a decrease of "Anschauung", i.e., a decrease of evidence: As for God, in Fl 1.7 he writes that: II. Gods and spirits, what we call superstitions. This belief is primitive science. One tries to explain phenomena which are not understood by analogy with everyday experiences.82 He comes back to the subject many times. In particular, he reports de Pater's opinion on the functions of the proofs of God's existence (in particular that by St. Anselmus: St. Anselmus emphasised that the idea of an entity is conceivable such that it is impossible to think of another entity which is more perfect - Latin "maius". Its existence is one kind of perfection, therefore this entity must really exist, otherwise there would be another one more perfect): W. A. de Pater, Taalanalytische perspectieven op godsdienst en kunst. - Filosofie en Kultuur. Disclosure = passage to a limit The "I" can only be known by self-disclosure God can be known only by disclosure. Functions of proofs of God's existence: 1. They are technical tools to bring about disclosure. 2. They give us clues on the logical behaviour of the word "God". [The former coincides with the inspiration which comes from croyance] [also by using metaphors]. A miracle is a miracle for the believer only; for others it is only an unexplained phenomenon. (F8.4)83 First, de Pater defined "disclosure" as a passage to limit (transcending experience - in the case of God, transcending the experience of the whole world - by starting from it). An example is the definition of a circle as a regular polygon with infinitely many sides. Then he explained the two functions of the proofs: (1) technical systems to stimulate a (cosmic) disclosure; (2) clues for using the word "God", in order to build theology. Heyting also quotes (with an exclamation mark) Berkeley's proof of God's existence as a mind which perceives ideas when we do not (see later). A further reference to the long-standing problems connected with the Anselmian proof is by Nuchelmans. Heyting simply reports the fact that Nuchelmans deals with Moore's opposition to the idea that existence is a property. Nuchelmans considered this position so as to emphasise how an analysis of language can solve an old question, i.e., how one can infer the existence of something (God) from its definition. Heyting recalls that Moore had realised that "to exist" is not a predicate by considering the differences between the three following couples of expressions:</page><page sequence="29">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 235 (1) "tame tigers roar" and "tame tigers exist". The first expression has three possible meanings: "all tame tigers roar"; "most tame tigers roar"; "some tame tigers roar". The second expression has only one: "some tame tigers exist". (2) "some tame tigers do not roar" and "some tame tigers do not exist". The first expression has a meaning, the second does not. (3) "some tame tigers roar" and "some tame tigers exist". In order to check if they are true, the first one requires that something exists and that it roars; the second one requires only that something exists. 11. WHAT IS COMMON TO HUMAN BEINGS Animals have a representation of the outer world similar to ours: only, they do not form a further abstract structure as human beings do. Levels of abstraction are typical of human beings, but most of them stop at the fifth level: Not every man goes through phases 1-10. Most of them do not go further than 5. (Fl 1.7)84 Therefore it can be said that abstraction (culture) is what is common to all men. In this sense he shares Popper's distinction between worlds 1, 2 and 3 as respectively the outer world (physical world), the world of mental states, the world of the contents of thought, but he modifies the order (2, 3, 1). He finds that Popper's conception of "human knowledge" as artefact in world 3 is clarifying. [... ] There are feelings and thoughts, which clearly are only mine. There are also thoughts, which I consider as common to other men. These belong to world 3. (F5 p. 39)85 As for the question whether we build Popper's world 2 ourselves, Heyting finds a contradiction in Popper where he affirms that there is an evolving "passage" to world 2 which presupposes that world 2 already exists without men (F5 p. 30: "p. 518. It seems as if world 2 existed before men, but this cannot be. This seems in contradiction with Popper's philosophy"). Hey ting also recalls a justification by Popper for mental objects to be considered as real things: they act on world 1 by way of world 2 experiences: On p. 39 interaction with world 1 is called a criterion for reality. (F5 p. 52)86 - for instance, a scientific theory through its applications may change the face of the earth. (Heyting affirms that "on p. 79 it is clearly said what 'real' means for worlds 2 and 3",87 but in fact Popper explains only</page><page sequence="30">236 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA what "real" means in case of world 3.) He also underlines that Popper here explains how our representation of the world breaks down: theory - problem (alternatively, understanding of the problem from a book: world 2 about world 3) - solution - its expression (choice of one of the possible expressions) - discussion and experiments - applications. Heyting suggests that we try to interpret psychologically the idea of world 3. Heyting reports Popper's clear distinction between subjective world (world 2) and objective world (world 3): At the end (p. 132) a distinction is made between subjective (world 2) and objective knowledge. (F5 p. 52)88 The gradual passage towards the sciences enlarges and refines spatial/time ordering; in this, cooperation is indispensable: I try to expand and refine this ordering. Gradual passage to the sciences. (Here "we" is essential.) (F6.7)89 Continuing with abstraction, one finds single schemata: Every man possesses many schemata more or less linked to each other (mathematical systems projected over one's own spiritual life). Development consists (among other things) in making more links between these schemata. (F8.33)90 12. CAUSALITY In F9.3 he notes that "causality already enters on step 3"91 of the scale proposed above. In F9.4 he observes that: causality is initially an extension of the concept of an action directed to a goal, something anthropomorphical.92 About this subject, Heyting begins with stating that the assertion that every change requires a cause is untenable: The concept of causality. "every change has a cause". Untenable. Mathematisation by means of differential equations. The situation of the world at a certain moment determines that of the future (F5 p. 38).93 Then he reports Popper's definition (without any comment): there is a log ical link between cause and effect within a theory. Finally, he gives Rus sell's definition in an abstract of Human Knowledge. He explains Russell's description of the development of the concept of cause, and then admits that Russell's conceptual analysis is valid (F18.2: "Summarising. Russell</page><page sequence="31">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 237 gives a very worthwhile analysis of the formation of concepts, above all in science").94 At the very beginning, one (also animals) perceives A and unconsciously expects B. The second step is that one believes: "There is A, then B comes". The third step is that one believes the general rule: "A is a sign for B". The passage from the second to the third step is through induction. 13. LOGIC The reflections reviewed above lead to very important consequences where logic is concerned. Namely, Heyting affirms that it is wrong to identify thought and logical thought. Firstly, everyday language is not logical. Only artificial languages are, but these are not relevant to philosophy. However, in general one can say that what concerns language is irrelevant for studying thought, since language serves to communicate but not to think. Here Heyting is again very close to Brouwer's opinions while in opposition to Mannoury, who maintained that logical rules are derived from grammatical ones (they are the constants present in all languages). On the other hand, according to Heyting one cannot even define logic as "necessary thought", as expressing something which is always true: truth is usually relative and doubtful, therefore it is an unfounded speculation to assume that plain statements of facts exist. As a consequence, also the possibility of considering the law of excluded middle as valid at least for simple straightforward statements of facts fails (F.18): In common thought, truth is always relative and questionable. It could be thought that the disjunction "true or false" holds for plain statements of facts, but it is an unfounded speculation that such statements exist.95 As for the subject of "logic", we also find a quotation by Heyting of Krech and Crutchfield, where they maintain that logic is not the registration of thought as this usually proceeds in a natural way, but logic imposes rules upon all thought. Namely, part of thought directly obeys logical laws, while it sometimes uses a "psychological logic", i.e., it lets itself be influenced by context (by apparent similarities, for example). 14. LANGUAGE The theme of language is then reconsidered in these notes several times, and there are some surprises. It had been a central point of interest and reflection in Heyting's scientific life. In his very first publications, where he presented his formalisation of intuitionist logic and mathematics, he</page><page sequence="32">238 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA affirmed that he shared the main opinions of his teacher about this sub ject: that mathematics is a languageless mental activity and logic is a transcription of the regularities present in the expressions of mathematics. Later, he affirmed that mathematics proceeds aided by language. Finally, he inferred from this fact the necessity of a new way to put the question of the foundations of mathematics. The latter implied a change of perspective in this field - as it stated the impossibility of an absolute foundation of mathematics by either of the three schools and affirmed the fact that each of their proposals simply expresses one of the aspects hidden and mixed in traditional mathematics - so one would think that he would have been completely sure of his opinion. On the contrary, Heyting comes back to the subject in these notes and shares Brouwer's opinion that communicating means influencing: Language serves to influence others. If I say: "The assertion that there is an outer world has no clear meaning", then I want to induce others to reflect on their belief in an outer world. Relations with other people play a special role, next to the idea of an outside world. (F8.24)96 He also refers to Austin's book How to do things with words, by emphasiz ing the fact that the author lists some uses of language (the performative ones) which are not communicative, and for which there is no meaning in asking whether these assertions are true or not (F17.4): J. L. Austin, How to do things with words. It indicates different ways of the use of language in which there is no communication, such that a sentence is not either correct or incorrect. Examples: to love, ceremonies like marriage. Such a sentence may be "unhappy" (unsuccessful?) in any case. "I promise that..." cannot be either right or not, but more or less successful. (Insincere, impossible to fulfil). A. calls such sentences "performative". There is a close link between information and action; this holds also for language expres sions. P. 144: "It is essential to realise that 'true' and 'false', like 'free' and 'unfree', do not stand for simple at all; but only for a general dimension of being a right or proper thing to say as opposed to a wrong thing, in these circumstances, to this audience, for these purposes and with these intentions". Finally, A gives a list of words, which are used in different ways of language (1 ) verdictives (judging) (2) exercitives (exercising power) (3) commissives (committing oneself) (4) behabitives (social behaviour) (5) expositives (ordering conversation)97 He reflects again on the role of language in thought and notes the interest of a chapter by Krech and Crutchfield about language. They explain that</page><page sequence="33">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 239 there are two opposite views about it: one in favour of and another against the indispensability of language for thinking. They underline that exper imental data do not give a definitive answer to the question. A phase of "silent thought" can be found in little children, where both grammar and vocabulary seem to have almost no role in thinking. They play a role only in communicating: nevertheless, the more affinity and sympathy there are between speaker and addressee, the less rules and modifications are applied in the discourse (this was already an idea of Brouwer's). However, it must be admitted that sometimes, when trying to express a thought in words, one notices that one had not really completed the thought, although one believed one had. Therefore, the two authors suggested an intermediate answer to the question: language is very useful for thought (F12 p. 6: "the whole section about language is important").98 In F8.17 Heyting affirms that language is only or "at least principally" useful for social relations: hence, it is not fundamental We must distinguish between the personal life of a man and his social links, although the former strongly depend on the latter. Personal life is the only direct datum and relations to others are a part of it. Language has only - at least principally - links with social relations and so it is not fundamental. (F8.17)99 Heyting also mentions Popper's opinion about language: it is useful for world 3 to become objective and therefore criticisable. Heyting also asks himself what kind of language is to be used in order to describe introspection: What kind of language must I use in describing introspection? Poetic language? In any case, I come up against a difficulty like that of a poet who wants to express his "most individual emotions". (F5 p. 39)100 He finds interesting Popper's observation that languages contain theories in themselves (F5 p. 52). This was already an idea of the Signifie circle, but Heyting does not mention this fact. He also refers to Wittgenstein's famous final observation (in his Tractatus) and replies that it is, however, not always possible to express all that we know It is not right to say that we can say all that we know. From experience it appears that you can know quite well how to go to a certain place, but finds it difficult to explain it. (F8.17)101 He also observes that to analyse language by using language is a vicious circle. For all cases of vicious circles, Heyting suggests the method of pro gressively moving nearer and nearer. Therefore, he distinguishes different steps on a scale and uses the higher to speak for the lower: reflections on a lower level are formulated in the higher:</page><page sequence="34">240 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA Fellow-men-language. 7.1 assume that they also perceive the same world as I do, and I accept their communications about existing things. 8. Here begins the role of language. Reflecting on language, one encounters a vicious circle, because the result of the reflection is again expressed by language. The circle can be interrupted only by means of the method of progressively moving nearer and nearer. Different steps of the scale are distinguished. The reflection on a consideration expressed in language is formulated at a following language level. (F8.12)102 15. PHILOSOPHY Language is also reconsidered as far as philosophy is concerned. As for language in philosophy, in F8.7 Heyting lists three kinds of languages: daily language, which is suitable for daily life (daily life usually does not often need reflection: Heyting remarks that we mostly react instinctive ly during the day) and hence not to express deep reflections; scientific language which differs from daily language, because of its stricter organ isation; poetical language, which uses a great deal of metaphors since it aims to express emotions and feelings. He considers it obvious why phi losophy cannot use scientific language (=formalised, symbolic language). Therefore, since philosophy has to provide truths, but only after much reflection, it has to use a somehow modified daily language: The greatest difficulty for philosophy consists in the lack of a philosophical language. Daily language suits the needs of daily life, where reflection is more a nuisance than useful. Science has developed its own language, which differs from daily language mainly in its much stricter organisation. Poetic language, on the contrary, is in general less linked to fixed rules than daily language, and uses many more metaphors. When reading a scientific treatise, the most important question is whether what is affirmed in it is true; when reading poetry, this will not be the first question asked, and if one does, then one is conscious that the word "true" is used in another sense. One asks oneself whether feelings are adequately expressed. Philosophy agrees with science in this respect, that philosophy in general claims that its assertions are true, but this concept of truth has to do with a domain which is far removed from daily life and, therefore, daily language is not suitable. Still, the use of language in philosophy starts from daily language, to which technical terms are added and metaphorical expressions characteristic for each philosopher. (F8.8)103 The existence of special terms defined within a specific philosophical system, already introduced in 1947 ("Taal en teken in de wiskunde") to show that it is completely normal for metaphysical systems to define new specific terms, assumes here a major role: it introduces an apparent difference between systems. Namely, according to Heyting, philosophy has always considered the same problems and given the same answers;</page><page sequence="35">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 241 however, its practitioners did not notice this fact since they spoke different languages. This is a form of one-sideness. Therefore, Heyting affirms that philosophers should never write histories of philosophy, because they interpret the ideas of others from their own point of view. On the other hand, he mentions "secondary philosophy", defined as the translation from the terminology of one particular philosophy to another. In these notes Heyting tries many times to find further "definitions", better "meanings" of philosophy. As we have already recalled, in Heyting's published papers we find the opinion that philosophy is the analysis (the consciousness) of the work of mathematicians (1958) and a theory of value (1968). In F5 p. 28 he lists two possibilities of definition: (1) as a synopsis of sciences (through metaphysical hypotheses or mystical intuition); (2) as a bridge between the conscious life and science: Philosophy can take two positions: 1. It can accept all existent sciences and arts and construct a system upon them by trying to make a synthesis. This can happen through quasi-scientific (metaphysical) hypotheses, or through a more or less mystic vision. Most important systems consist of a combination of the two methods. 2. It can try to throw a bridge between our immediate conscious life and the sciences. This happens more or less in analytical philosophy. (F5 pp. 28-29)1(M Later (F8.27), he goes on to say that one of the partial tasks of philosophy is to give a theory of sensations: One of the aims of philosophy consists in giving a connected theory of perceptions. In doing this, philosophy is necessarily falsified, but the existing shapes and theory of knowledge are far too rough (to work out).105 In F8.7 - in what may have been the beginning of an article on solipsism - he gave as a meaning of philosophy what he had found in Kuiper's Encyclopedia: Philosophy embraces all reflection on human thought and behaviour, all questions about their meaning and content.l06 but he also states that In what follows certain concrete philosophical questions will be discussed, without the need for a general definition of philosophy.107 In F8.14 he says that reflection on thought and the sciences in general is typical for philosophy: Thinking begins with the following: I direct my attention to a certain perception, which in this way becomes created, and isolated in the content of my consciousness. Is this psychology? This view leads to contradiction, at least to a vicious circle.</page><page sequence="36">242 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA Namely, psychology as a science starts with perceived facts and perception of these facts already has the above-given character. The above assertion does not belong to a science, but to the reflection on thought in general and on science in particular. This reflection is a feature of philosophy.108 However, since knowledge is relative, no meaning exists. Hence, it is useless to ask whether a certain philosophy is true or not: Two philosophers do not agree. How can this happen? Both are clever and have reflected deeply on the specific question. It must be that they use words with different meanings, and since the meaning of a word can be determined only by the use made of it, the difference in meaning must be determined by the individual's work. This is an important task of secondary philosophy. Instead of two philosophers one can also study the work of one in this way! (F8.19)109 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I am very indebted to Prof. A. S. Troelstra who suggested this subject to me, made the material of Heyting's archive available to me and read carefully all the drafts of my paper. NOTES 1 Er is echter een gro?te groep ondervindingen en gewaarwordingen, die niets met het ruimtebegrip te maken hebben; daaronder vallen alle gemoedstoestanden, en ook gewaar wordingen als honger, smaak, reuk, enz. Een wezen, dat het ruimtebegrip in't geheel niet had, zou desondanks kunnen leven; het zou gelukking en ongelukking kunnen zijn; pijn, smart, vreugde, kortom alle gevoelens met de menschen kunnen deelen. Zijn instinct zou hem de noodige bewegingen doen maken om in zijn lichamelijke behoeften te voorzien zonder dat het zieh daarbij een beweging in de ruimte behoeft voor te stellen. Mij dunkt, dit is het beeld dat wij ons moeten vormen van het leven der lagere dieren. Het is niet aan te nemen dat een polyp, die een vangarm uitstrekt om een visch te grijpen, daarbij een ruimtevoorstelling heeft. Hoogstens is er op een of andere wijze verband tusschen het gevoel van voedselbehoefte, dat het dier heeft, den prikkel door de nabijheid van de visch veroorzaakt, en de contractie van zekere spiercellen bij het uitsteken van den vangarm. Bij de hoogere dieren met hun meerdere behoeften wordt de ruimtevoorstelling als middel in de strijd om het bestaan steeds meer onmisbaar, en bij zoogdieren en vogels is zij dan ook zonder twijfel in vrij hooge mate aanwezig. Toch ontvangen allen, zelfs de mensch, hun indrukken allereerst in nietruimtelijken vorm. Prof. Troelstra pointed out that the notes F 1.1 and F 1.2 are much older than all the others. A first sign of this is the ink; another reason is the spelling used by Heyting. Since the Dutch spelling was officially changed in 1947, these notes presumably have been written before that date. The essential content of these notes agrees with the contents of the more recent ones, still their style is more poetical, according to the mystical tradition, which can also be found in Brouwer's Leven, kunst en mystiek.</page><page sequence="37">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 243 2 Het begrip "beweging van ons lichaam is onafhankelijk" van het ruimte begrip. Het veronderstelt slechts de gewaarwordingen, die de contracties van onze Spieren ons geven. 3 Een dergelijke analyse als wij hier op de ruimte toegepast hebben laat zieh ook op den tijd toepassen; dit zij den lezer ter oefening aanbevolen. 4 Het is mij alsof ik een fijn weefsel ben, maar bedekt met een dikke verflaag, zoodat alleen de grove plooiingen zichtbaar blijven. Waar het mij lukt de laag te verwijderen, komt het patroon voor den dag, en het is een onbeschrijflijk patroon.

Contradictoire beeiden zouden dan gedacht moeten worden in een systeem, dat op zichzelf beschouwd wordt.

[A symbol (as its etymology implies) is essentially a "corrigible" or "reviseable"]. 8 Angst voor solipsisme. Nuchelmans, Overzicht van de analytische wijsbegeerte. 9 Samenvatting. Russell geeft een zeer waardevolle analyse van de begripsvorming, vooral in de wetenschap. Het blijft echter op twee gedachten hinken wat betreft de interpretatie van de buitenwereld. Enerzijds herleidt hij alles tot "beliefs" in zijn geest, anderzijds neemt hij an dat een "belief" slaat op iets buken hem. Het blijft onduidelijk wat hiermee precies bedoeld wordt. Het uitgangspunt is solipsistisch, maar nadat een karikaturale vorm van het solipsisme verworpen is, wordt het niet duidelijk wat er voor in de plaats komt. 10 De vraag naar de betekenis van "bestaan" hangt samen met de onderscheiding tussen ik-taak en het-taal (Mannoury): Ik kan zeggen: "Daar staat een kerktoren" of "Ik zie een kerktoren". Het laatste in de zin van een waarneming, waarin de interpretatie vervat is. 11 De psychologie onderzoekt de aard en samenstelling van de geisoleerde pereeptie en haar relaties met de rest van de bewustzijnsinhoud. 12 Alle onbewuste kennis bestaat alleen in th?orie. Voor de kennistheorie is het onbewuste irrelevant. 13 Twee betekenissen van "I": I have a tootache (1); I have got a match-box (2). In (1) zijn "I" en "conscious" equivalent, in (2) niet. (Mijn gedachte: Hetzelfde verschil bestaat tussen bewuste en onbewuste gevoelens; de laatste bestaan alleen theoretisch.) 14 In een aantekening van 30.8.36 lees ik "Om ijzer te onderzoeken, zijn ijzeren instrumenten nodig; eveneens voor het onderzoeken van natuurlijke getallen het begrip "natuurlijk getal": Dit is in geen van beide gevallen een vicieuze cirkel, want het nat. get. als bouwsteen is iets anders dan het nat. get. als vormsel. . .". Kan men iets dergelijks zeggen over het onderzoek van het denken door middel van denken (introspectie)? 15 De uitspraak: "de gedachte aan een buitenwereld is een illusie" is geen goede uitdrukking van het solipsisme, want hij onderstelt dat er een buitenwereld zou kunnen zijn, althans dat wij weten wat dat betekent. 16 Als de solipsist inderdaad beweert, dat hij alleen bestaat en verder niets, dan is zijn th?orie inderdaad gemakkelijk ad absurdum te voeren (Wittgenstein 58).</page><page sequence="38">244 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA 17 Already in English in the text. 18 Already in English in the text. 19 Men kan het werk van Kuhn opvatten als een uitwerking en verfijning van dat van Popper. Als er een tegenstelling is, dan ligt die in de realistische opvatting van Popper, die waarheid definieert als overeenstemming van een propositie met de feiten. Volgens Kuhn veranderen bij een revolutie ook de feiten, of althans de betekenis van de gebruikte termen. 20 Waarheid. De juistheidsovertuiging beperkt zieh niet tot de stoffelijke buitenwereld. Ik zeg: "Klaas is een schurk", en meen dat dit zo is. De vraag of de buitenwereld er nu echt is of dat ik ze alleen maar denk, is zinloos. Ik denk ze, dat is het enige, wat ik weet. 21 Eerst: verder is er niets "bepaalds", "scherps" in te vinden: de gewaarwordingen gaan vloeiend in elkaar over en hebben geen eigen individualiteit. Wanneer wij nu toch bepaaldheid aannemen. over afzonderlijke "dingen" spreken en alle gebeuren in ruimte en tijd zieh laten afspelen, is het noodzakelijk dat wij onze bewustzijnsinhoud bewust of onbewust door iets anders vervangen, met andere woorden een onwaarheid, een leugen begaan. (de leugen van het discrete). 22 Kort overzicht. Er is een geleidelijke overgang van de ordering, die ik spontaan in mijn directe ervaring aanbreng, naar de pogingen van de wetenschap, zoveel mogelijk menselijke ervaring in een systeem te ordenen. De rol van wiskundige begrippen, hoewel van het begin af aanwezig, neemt in deze ontwikkeling steeds toe. In de laatste eeuw [hebben zieh twee belangrijke ontwikkelin gen voorgedaan] heeft de 1.

Er is weinig onderscheid tussen "Ik denk", "Ik loop", "Ik ben boos", enz. Ik bevind mij in een wereld van stoffelijke dingen, die ik waarneem. Door herinneringen breid ik die uit tot niet direct waarneembare dingen, waarvan ik aanneem dat zij er ook zijn als ik ze niet waarneem. Onder de dingen bevinden zieh andere mensen, waarvan ik aanneem dat zij analoge gedachten en gevoelens hebben als ik.</page><page sequence="39">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 245 Zie C. Dit laatste geldt alleen voor mensen van mijn eigen groep. Nog niet lang geleden werden arbeiders door de rijken als heel andere wezens beschouwden nu denken en voelen velen nog zo over negers. De communicatiemiddelen maken de groepen steeds groter. 31 Het is erg moeilijk, zieh los te maken van de gedachte, dat er echt een buitenwereld is, en tot het inzicht te komen dat deze gedachte ook iets in mijzelf is. Hetzelfde geldt voor de banden van vriendschap en haat. 32 Original in English. 33 Geest en stof zijn niet gescheiden; de medemens verschijnt mij ook stoffelijk. 34 Popper and Eccles, dialogue IL Het is moeilijk, aan de vraag naar het bewustzijn van dieren, een duidelijke zin te geven. Ik neem mijn eigen bewustzijn waar en uit een vorm van sympathie ken ik dat van andere mensen, maar ik kan geen voorstelling hebben van bewustzijn in andere wezens. Ik ken bewustzijn alleen uit innerlijke waarneming. Om te weten of een hond bewustzijn heeft, zou ik mij in die hond moeten kunnen verplaatsen. 35 Most of the quotes of Popper's works refer to his Objective Knowledge, while only a few of them refer to his Unended Quest. I will specify this latter case exclusively. 36 Een bewijs voor het bestaan van een buitenwereld moet een vicieuze cirkel bevatten, want het gaat uit van de onderstelling dat "buitenwereld" iets betekent, en dat begrip sluit het bestaan er van in. Het bewijs van Moore uit dit gezichtspunt ontleden. In ieder geval vond Moore een bewijs nodig. 37 "Er bestaat een buitenwereld". Betekent dit iets meer dan dat wij onze waarnemingen in de vorm van een buitenwereld ordenen? Dit blijkt doeltreffend. Op grond van de evolutieleer mag men aannemen dat wij juist daardoor tot die wijze van ordenen zijn gekomen. Deze beschouwing is eenzijdig en bevat een petitio principii. Eenzijdig omdat lang niet ons hele geestelijk even op een buitenwereld betrokken is. De petitio principii ligt in "wij". De medemens heeft een heel sp?ciale plaats in ons geestesleven. 38 Bewustzijnsinhoud,levensmoment, gedachten-en gevoelsleven? Ieder woord suggereert een niet bedoelde interpretatie. Er is geen sprake van ruimte of tijd. Zeer ingewikkeld en onoverzichtelijk. Er zijn geen afzonderlijke data in de zin van Russell. Het komt aan op de beleving van de voorstelling van een buitenwereld. Sommige gewaarwordingscomplexen zijn op een bepaalde wijze gekleurd, gaan gepaard met een gevoel dat ik omgevingsgevoel noem; het houdt een gevoel van veiligheid in maar tevens een bedreiging en een uitdaging tot handelen. Wat dit gevoel in mij opwekt, interpreteer ik als teken van een buitenwereld, als buken mij geplaatst. 39 Maar het meerdere: 'bestaan de voorwerpen ook als ik ze niet waarneem?' ligt op een ander plan. Het vraagt naar het systeem, waarin wij al onze gewaarwordingen ordenen. Dit systeem ligt in grote lijnen vast, maar veel minder vast dan Kant dacht. In het dagelijks leven kennen wij noch een Euklidische ruimte, noch een homogene tijd. 40 Waarom ben ik overtuigd dat Japan bestaat? Wei, omdat het mij op school verteld is en omdat ik mij voorstel dat sommige mensen de dingen daar waarnemen zoals ik mijn omgeving waarneem. Hier gaat de intersubjectiviteit een grote rol speien. 41 Identification. Belangrijk voor begrip medemens. 42 Voor mij is het moeilijk, mij vrij te maken van op school geleerde theorie?n.</page><page sequence="40">246 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA 43 Fantasie en droom tegenover werkelijkheid. 44 Onderscheid tussen percept and (sic!) image. 45 Naar aanleiding van G.E. Moore, Proof of an external world. Waarom is een nabeeld geen ruimtelijk voorwerp? Moore zegt: omdat een ander het niet kan zien. Ik zeg: omdat het niet past in de organisatie van onze ervaring. 46 Popper's oplossing van Hume's paradox zegt niets. De vraag blijft dezelfde: Waarom is de th?orie die de vroegere ervaring het beste verklaart ook de beste voor toekomstige ervaring? 47 De directe, psychologische, inductie, die Hume aan gewoonte toeschrijft, is verschillend van de wetenschappelijke inductie. De laatste maakt deel uit van de systematische ordening van de ervaring. 48 De wetenschappelijke gevolgtrekking berust op inductie. Inductie kan niet bewezen worden. Als men probeert ze logisch te formuleren komt men altijd tot uitspraken, die in vele gevallen fout zijn. Inductie is een gewoonte, die behoort tot de aanpassing aan de omgeving, waarvan biologisch overleven afhankelijk is. Generalisatie als een gewoonte van verwachting ontstaat op een lager nivo dan dat van bewust denken. 49 101. Reeds Augustinus beschouwde de idee?n van Plato als gedachten van God, waarvan de dingen onvolkomen verwezenlijkingen zijn. 30 c. Zijn de dingen er ook als ik ze niet zie? Zinloze vraag. Wij maken onze th?orie zo dat dit geldt, want dit is het eenvoudigst. 51 Het kan ook een ding zijn dat zieh aan mij voordoet als buiten mij geplaatst. Hiertoe besluit ik niet door redenering op grond van bepaalde gegevens, integendeel, het is de directe, onberedeneerde wijze van opvatting van het ding. Ik neem niet eerst verschillend gekleurde vlekken waar en maak daaruit op dat er een boom staat, neen, ik neem direct een boom waar en ik besef dat die boom er is, ik neem hem waar als bestaande. Dit bestaansbe sef bestaat in een bepaalde kleuring van de waarneming, in een begeleidend gevoel dat ik "echtsheidsgevoel" wil noemen. Dit echtheidsgevoel is dus in eerste instantie wat ik bedoel met "bestaan". 52 Phil, redeneert ongeveer zo: Mijn zintuigen worden aangedaan; er moet iets zijn dat ze aandoet, maar dit kan niets anders zijn dan het complex waarnemingen van het ding, dat in een woord samengevat wordt. 53 Nu komt het verstand in werking. Het legt verband tusschen deze indrukken en vroegere dergelijke, die het al heeft weten te vereenigen als gezichtsindrukken. Vroeger zijn op dergelijke indrukken na zekere bewegingen tastgewaarwordingen gevolgd, waarvan het verstand er alweer eenige tot het begrip "lichaam" heeft weten te vereenigen. Het besluit daaruit, dat ook in dit geval na zekere bewegingen wij die tastgewaarwordingen zouden krijgen, dat er dus lichamen zijn. En alweer op grond van vroegere ervaringen komt het tot een voorstelling van den aard en den vorm van die lichamen; die voorstelling bestaat uit denkbeeidige gezichts- en tastgewaarwordingen. 54 De kritiek op Russell is juist. Inderdaad, ik neem niet het effect van de steen op mijzelf waar; deze formulering onderstelt het bestaan van de steen. 55 Men moet het begrip van het "buiten mij gestelde" wel als fundamenteel aanvaar den. Hiervoor een woord bedenken. Objectief? Het moet de geestelijke activiteit van het "buiten mij stellen" uitdrukken. Ik schep die wereld, Het buitengestelde? Deze geestelijke activiteit is met zeer Sterke juistheidsgevoelens verbunden. Dat is ook weer een funda menteel gegeven, dat een eigen woord vereist. 56 Philonous betoogt de relativiteit van "hetzelfde". 57 Zie over natuurlijke organisatie van de waarneming Popper, Unended Quest, ?31 en noot 22.3.</page><page sequence="41">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 247 58 Popper and Eccles 481, voetnoot. When reading, "the meaning of a word may have priority over its spelling". Een argument hiervoor is dat ik dikwijls een ander woord lees dan er Staat, omdat ik een bepaalde beteke nis vermoed. 59 biz. 74 onder (3). Dit is een belangrijke opmerking over onze directe ervaring. 60 De "afzonderlijke stimuli" zijn abstracties. 61 Wij nemen tegelijk geheel en delen waar. Struktuur. 62 Kritiek op common sense. 63 Met is een misverstand, dat het direct gegevene in protocolzinnen uitgedrukt kan worden. 64 Goede opmerking van Popper over de "stream of consciousness". 65 Mijn bewustzijnsinhoud is op ieder ogenblik enorm ingewikkeld. Hij bevat talloze gezichts- en gehoorwaarnemingen, voorstellingen van afstanden en ruimtelijke vormen, gevoelens van bewondering, schrik, vrees, afkeer of vreugde, herinneringen, woordbeelden, verwachtingen, enz. Het heeft geen zin te vragen of ik dat inderdaad allemaal tegelijk ervaar. De wisseling van indrukken gaat ontzaglijk snel (vlugge m?lodie, wij nemen elke noot apart waar, want wij kunnen de m?lodie reproduceren). Wat mij bewust wordt is een continue stroom van snel wisselende indrukken. 66 In ?38 is de discussie over het onbewuste belangrijk, vooral de mogelijkheid om onbe wuste zaken bewust te maken. Herinnering speelt hier een rol. 67 Met begrip Zelf. 68 Kan men over gevoelens spreken, losgemaakt uit het geheel van het bewustzijn, zonder eerst een entit? it te denken? 69 De beschrijving van de struktuur van de hersens door Eccles doet weer twijfelen aan de mogelijkheid dat deze door toevallige mutaties kan zijn ontstaan. Een argument voor de evolutiehypothese zie ik in de wijze waarop de gezichtsindrukken worden ge?nterpreteerd. 70 Het lichaam geeft mij moeilijkheden. Ik voel pijn in mijn grote teen. Het is onmogelijk het pijngevoel los te maken van zijn localisatie: Wat het eigen lichaam betreft is de voorstelling van een buitenwereld primair. 71 De antieke voorstelling van de wereld als begrensd door de bol der vaste sierren, stond dichter bij die naieve ruimtevoorstelling. 72 Philonous betoogt dat uitbreiding (extension) (ruimte) niet gedacht kan worden zonder qualities (176). Daarom bestaat ruimte niet op zichzelf. 73 Leven na de dood en eeuwigheid - Na mijn dood is mijn tijd er niet meer. De objectieve tijd is een theoretische constructie, waarin ik niet leef, ook niet in een later leven. Gaat die tijd door als de hele materi?le wereld vergaat? (Dit is een schijnvraag.) 74 Ik ervaar de wereld niet alleen als zijnde, maar ook als zo-zijnde. 75 Original in English. 76 Pijn, verliefdheid, woede "zijn er". Overeenkomst met het buitenwereldgevoel is de weerstand die deze gewaarwordingen bieden aan de wil. Toch wordt dit bestaan ervaren als duidelijk verschillend van dat van de buitenwereld. 77 Echtheidsgevoel en medemens-gevoel liggen ten grondslag aan de scheiding tussen materie en geest. 78 De scheiding van lichaam en geest is niet primair gegeven. Ik beleef mijn lichaam en mijn denken en waarnemen als een geheel. Voor de scheiding tussen lichamelijke gevoelens als pijn enerzijds en denken anderzijds is reeds reflectie nodig. 79 First paragraph: original in English. [Maar dit geloof is niet iets abstracts; het is gebonden aan een gegeven situatie en functioneert daarin, zonder ons bewust te worden.

In elk van die werelden bestaan voor hen andere dingen en wordt het woord "bestaan" in andere zin gebruikt. (1) De directe omgeving. Personen daarin. (2) Voorstelling van omgeving en waarheen ik mij van hier uit kan begeven. De trappen gaan gedeeltelijk in elkaar over. Zij overlappen elkaar. (3) Herinneringsbeelden van omgevingen, waar ik mij vroeger heb bevonden. Hier speelt het begrip van medemensen een rol. (4) Mededelin gen van anderen.

Eerst zijn het de voorwerpen uit mijn direkte omgeving, die bestaan; tenslotte zijn het sierren en mesons. Hoewel trappen liggen daartussen en hoe ver?ndert het begrip bij zijn tocht daarlangs? God, re?le getallen en hoge kardinaalgetallen staan bovenaan zulke trappen. Op welke trap gelden de logische regels voor de existentiequantor? 82 II. Goden en geesten, wat wij bijgeloof noemen. Dit geloof is primitieve wetenschap. Men tracht onbegrepen verschijnselen te verklaren in analogie met dagelijkse ervaringen. 83 Disclosure=limietovergang.

Zij geven ons wenken m.b.t. het logische gedrag van het woord "God", [le valt samen met de inspiratie, die van croyance uitgaat]. [ook met het gebruik van metaforen]. Een wonder is alleen een wonder voor de gelovige, voor anderen is het alleen een onverklaard verschijnsel. 84 Niet ieder mens doorloopt die fasen 1-10. De meesten komen niet verder dan 5. 85 Popper's opvatting van "human knowledge" als artefact in wereld 3 is verhelderend. [... ] Er zijn gevoelens en gedachten die duidelijk alleen van mijzelf zijn. Er zijn ook gedachten die ik als gemeenschappelijk met medemensen beschouw. Deze behoren tot wereld 3. 86 Op biz. 39 wordt interactie met wereld 1 als crit?rium voor realiteit genoemd. 87 Op biz. 79 wordt duidelijk gezegd wat real betekent in Worlds 2 en 3. 88 Aan het slot (biz. 132) wordt de subjectieve (world 2) kennis onderscheiden van objec tieve (world 3) kennis. 89 Ik poog deze ordening uit te breiden en te verfijnen. Geleidelijke overgang naar weten schap. (Hierbij is wij essentieel). 90 Ieder mens bezit een groot aantal min of meer met elkaar verbonden schema's (wiskundi ge Systemen geprojecteerd op zijn geestesleven). Ontwikkeling bestaat o.a. in het brengen van meer verband tussen die schema's. 91 Causaliteit treedt reeds op in trap 3. 92 Causaliteit is eerst een uitbreiding van het begrip van doelgericht handelen, iets anthro pomorfs. 93 Het causaliteitsbegrip."ledere verandering heeft een oorzaak". Onhoudbaar. Mathema tisering door differentiaalvergelijkingen. De toestand van de wereld op zeker ogenblik bepaalt die voor de toekomst. 94 Samenvatting. Russell geeft een zeer waardevolle analyse van de begripsvorming, vooral in de wetenschap. 95 Waarheid is in het gewone denken altijd betrekkelijk en betwijfelbaar. Men zou kunnen denken dat de disjunctie waar v onwaar voor enkelvoudige uitspraken geldt, maar het is een ongegronde speculatie dat er zulke uitspraken zijn.</page><page sequence="43">LIKE A BEE ON A WINDOWPANE 249 96 Taal dient om anderen te be?nvloeden. Als ik zeg: "De bewering dat er een buitenwereld is, heeft geen duidelijke zin", dan wil ik anderen over hun geloof aan een buitenwereld aan het denken zetten. De relaties met andere mensen spelen een sp?ciale roi naast de voorstelling van de buitenwereld. 97 Geeft verschillende wijzen van taalgebruik aan, waarin geen mededeling wordt gedaan, zodat een zin niet of juist, of onjuist is. Voorbeelden: Beloven, riten zoals bij een huwelijk. Zo'n zin kan "unhappy" (mislukt?) zijn op allerlei manieren. "Ik beloof dat..." kan niet juist of onjuist zijn. we min of meer geslaagd. (Onoprecht, onmogelijk te volbrengen.) A. noemt zullen zinnen "performative". Er is een nauw verband tussen informatie en handeling; dit geldt ook voor taaluitingen. The rest of the quote was originally in English till the word "finally" in our transla tion: Tenslotte geeft A. een lijst van woorden die in verschillende soorten taal gebruikt wor den: (1) verdictives (oordelen), (2) exercitives (macht uitoefenen), (3) commissives (zieh verbinden), (4) behabitives (sociaal gedrag), (5) expositives (regelen gesprek). 98 Het heele hoofdstuk over taal is belangrijk. 99 Men moet onderscheiden tussen het persoonlijke leven van een mens en zijn sociale bindingen, ook al is het eerste sterk afhankelijk van de laatste. Het persoonlijk leven is het enige direct gegevene en de relaties tot anderen zijn daarvan een deel. De taal heeft alleen, althans in hoofdzaak, betrekking op de sociale relaties en is dus niet fundamenteel. 100 Wet voor taal moet ik voor de beschrijving van introspectie gebruiken? Dichterlijke taal? In ieder geval sta ik hier tegenover een dergelijke moeilijkheid als een dichter die zijn "allerindividuelste emotie" in woorden wil uitdrukken. 101 Het is niet juist dat wij alies wat wij weten ook kunnen zeggen. Uit ervaring blijkt dat jemand heel goed weet hoe hij naar een bepaalde plaats moet gaan, maar het moeilijk uit kan leggen. 102 Medemens - Taal. 7. Ik neem aan, dat zij dezelfde wereld waarnemen als ik en aanvaard hun mededelingen over bestaande dingen. 8. Hier begint de rol van de taal. Bij reflectie op de taal komt men in een vicieuze cirkel terecht, omdat het resultaat van de reflectie weer in taal uitgedrukt wordt. Die cirkel kan alleen verbroken worden door de m?thode der opeen volgende benaderingen. Verschillende taaltrappen worden onderscheiden. De reflectie op een in taal uitgedrukte beschouwing wordt in een volgende taaltrap geformuleerd. 103 De grootste moeilijkheid voor de filosofie bestaat in het ontbreken van een filosofi sche taal. De omgangstaal is aangepast aan de behoeften van het dagelijkse leven, waarin reflectie eerder lastig dan nuttig is. De wetenschap heeft een eigen taal ontwikkeld, die zieh van de omgangstaal voornamelijk onderscheidt door een veel strictere organisatie. Dichterlijke taal daarentegen is in het algemeen veel minder aan vaste regels gebonden dan de omgangstaal en maakt veel meer gebruik van metaforen. Bij het lezen van een wetenschappelijke verhandeling is de belangrijkste vraag of het waar is wat daarin beweerd wordt; bij het lezen van een gedieht zal men zieh deze vraag niet in de eerste plaats stellen en als men het we doet, dan is men zieh bewust dat men het woord "waar" in een andere zin dan de gewone gebruikt. Man vraagt zieh af, of gevoelens adequaat zijn uitgedrukt. Wijsbegeerte stemt hierin met wetenschap overeen, dat ze in het algemeen de pretentie heeft, dat haar beweringen waar zijn, maar dit waarheidsbegrip heeft betrekking op een gebied dat ver van het dagelijkse leven af ligt en waarvoor de omgangstaal ongeschikt is. Toch gaat het taalgebruik van de wijsbegeerte uit van de omgangstaal, die aangevuld wordt met technische termen en een voor iedere filosoof karakteristieke beeldspraak. 104 Filosofie kan zieh op twee manieren opstellen: 1. Zij kan alle bestaande wetenschap en kunst aanvaarden en daar een systeem bovenop bouwen, in een poging tot synth?se. Dit</page><page sequence="44">250 MIRIAM FRANCHELLA kan nog weer door quasi-wetenschappelijke (metafysische) hypothesen, of door een min of meer mystieke aanschouwing. De meeste grote Systemen bestaan in een onontwarbare combinatie van die twee methoden. 2. Zij kan trachten, een brug te leggen tussen ons directe bewustzijnsleven en de wetenschap. Dit gebeurt min of meer in de analytische filosofie. 105 Een van de doeleinden van de filosofie bestaat hierin, een samenhangende th?orie van de waarneming te geven. Hierbij wordt ze noodzakelijk vervalst, maar de bestaande vormen en kennistheorie zijn veel te grof. (uit te werken!) 106 Filosofie omvat alle reflectie op menselijk denken en handelen, aile vragen naar zin en inhoud daarvan. 107 In het volgende zullen bepaalde concrete filosofische vragen ter sprake komen, zonder dat daarvoor een algemene definitie van filosofie nodig is. 108 Denken begint met het volgende: Ik rieht mijn aandacht op een bepaalde perceptie, die daardoor geschapen en in mijn bewustzijnsinhoud ge?soleerd wordt. Is dit psychologie? Deze opvatting voert tot tegenspraak, althans tot een vicieuze cirkel. De psychologie als wetenschap gaat namelijk uit van waargenomen feiten en de waarneming daarvan heeft reeds het hierboven aangegeven karakter. De bovenstaande bewering behoort niet tot een wetenschap, maar tot de reflectie op denken in het algemeen en op wetenschap in het bijzonder. Deze reflectie is een kenmerk van filosofie. 109 Twee filosofen zijn het oneens. Hoe kan dat? Beide zijn intelligent en hebben het vraagstuk diep doordacht. Het moet dus wel zo zijn dat zij de woorden in verschillende betekenis gebruiken, en daar de betekenis van een woord alleen opgemaakt kan worden uit het gebruik dat er van gemaakt wordt, moet bet betekenisverschil uit hun werk op te maken zijn. Dit is een belangrijke taak van de secundaire filosofie. In plaats van twee filosofen kan men ook het werk van 1 filosoof zo bestuderen!
