<plain_text><page sequence="1">Artificial Intelligence and Philosoohy of Science1 Reasoning by Analogy in Theory Construction Lindley Darden University of Maryland, College Park 1. Introduction As a historian and philosopher of science, I am interested in the process of the construction of new scientific theories. The hypothesis to be explored in this paper is that analogies may play an important role in the generation of new ideas that are built into new theories. In order to make clear the locus of my discussion, I would like to present an over-simplified view of the levels of organization of scientific knowledge. The three levels are the following: data, empirical generalizations, and explanatory theories. At the lowest level of generality are the data, particular statements about particular facts. For example, if we consider data from genetics, in a cross between a yellow pea plant and a green pea plant, all the peas of the first generation of hybrids are yellow; if the hybrids are self-fertilized, the second hybrid generation has a ratio of three yellow peas to one green pea. The ratio of three yellow to one green is a datum of genetics. For the present, I wish to ignore any possible influence of prior theory on the data here discussed. Next, we have the empirical generalization which can be obtained by looking for regular patterns in the data; for example, the empirical law that in the second hybrid generation, the ratio of dominants to recessives is 3:1. Empirical laws contain no new concepts that cannot be completely specified in terms of the data; a "dominant" trait simply is that trait that appears in the hybrid. However, explanatory theories have new concepts, not found in the data and empirical generalizations, which serve in the explanation of those data and laws. For example, the concept of the gene is built into the theory of the gene which serves to explain the 3:1 ratios by postulating the segregation of genes in the formation of germ cells.

What can philosophers hope to understand about this process of the construction of new scientific theories? A prevailing view has been that the discovery of new theories is a matter of the individual psychology of the scientists, that there is no "logic of discovery". Karl Popper (1934) is a prominent proponent of this view and Carl Hempel (1966, p.114) argued that there can be no mechanical rules for producing the novel concepts found in theories. Although N. R. Hanson (1961) attempted to provide a logic of discovery, which he called "retroductive reasoning", he merely hinted at the way plausible hypotheses actually could be constructed. Philosophers are unlikely to find, as Hanson realized, an infallible logic of discovery. Instead, our task should be to find patterns of reasoning that can, with some measure of reliability, provide plausible hypotheses worthy of testing. One idea that Hanson mentions, but does not develop in detail, is that analogies may be useful in discovery. A series of questions need to be answered if we are going to understand how analogies function in theory construction. These questions are: 1) What is an analogy? 2) Are there types of analogies? 3) How do we find analogies? 4) How do we distinguish good from bad analogies? 5) How do we use analogies to construct scientific theories? 6) How can we test a proposed pattern of reasoning by analogy to see if it is adequate for constructing plausible hypotheses? I will not be able to completely answer all of these questions in this paper, but I want to begin the task. I will be drawing on literature from the fields of philosophy of science and artificial intelligence (for short AI). The field of AI has advanced to a point that it now holds the promise of providing important concepts and methods relevant to philosophy of science. Some of the problems being investigated by AI include: How is knowledge to be represented so that it can be used for various tasks, such as reasoning by an expert? What are the features of reasoning by analogy and how could such reasoning be implemented in a computer? What are the relations among general, abstract concepts and more specific instances of them? What heuristic rules can aid the solution of certain problems? Only a small portion of AI work has been specifically concerned with problems of discovery in science; nonetheless, many of the concepts and methods can be applied to scientific knowledge and reasoning. Furthermore, AI systems in the future may provide the means of testing proposed patterns of reasoning in discovery to see</page><page sequence="3">149 if they indeed can yield plausible hypotheses in a field of science. 2. Methods of Theory Construction The philosopher of science who has dealt most extensively with these questions is Mary Hesse in her book Models and Analozies in Scienca (1966). Hesse's key points are best illustrated by one of her examples. (See Fig. 1) She compares sound waves and light waves. The properties which are similar she designates as the positive analogy; the dissimilar properties constitute the negative analogy; the neutral analogy involves the properties of the analogue which may or may not be present in the subject field. In her example, the properties of light are the subject of investigation. Light has properties that are similar to properties of sound waves and the neutral analogy of a medium for the waves to travel in provided a plausible, but subsequently disproved, hypothesis about the existence of the ether. The horizontal relations between the analogue and the subject are usually those of similarity, although occasionally specific properties may be identical. The vertical relations among properties of the analogue should be, according to Hesse, causal relations, in the weak sense of a "tendency to co-occurrence." (Hesse 1966, p.77). Hesse indicates that the analogue may be important, not only in the original stages of theory construction, but also later: if the theory faces anomalies, the neutral analogy may be exploitable for further theory construction. Hesse's representation scheme of lining up properties of the analogue and subject is much like frame-structured representation schemas used in AI systems. (Minsky 1975; Thagard forthcoming) One could construct a frame for sound waves with slots for the properties of sound waves, such as travels in a medium, and values for the slots, with the slot "medium" having the value "air". Another frame could be constructed for light. Hesse's form of representation has the disadvantage that it does not make clear what the causal interconnections are between which properties. Also, I have found it difficult, in some actual historical cases, to decide whether a given property is an example of positive, negative or neutral analogy. But Hesse's method of theory construction by analogy may be a productive one for humans to use when adequately similar analogues can be found. Hesse does not tell us what we are to do when postulated causal connections fail, such as her own example of the postulation of the ether as a medium for light waves. The physicist Robert Oppenheimer, in an insightful paper of 1956, that Hesse does not cite in her 1966 book, discussed the role of analogies in discovering new theories. Analyzing the stages in the construction of the wave theory of light, Oppenheimer proposed that scientists came to the study of light phenomena with past experience of the nature of waves. But when the postulated medium for light waves was not found, it forced scientists to revise their previous view of necessary connections, to sever the notion of a wave from that of a medium. Thus, a failed portion of</page><page sequence="4">150 Figure 1.

From Hesse and Oppenheimer we can extract two methods of theory construction by analogy: look for a relevantly similar analogue and exploit the neutral analogy; if this process fails, consider severing connections between properties that were previously thought to be necessary connections. But these methods are limited if a relevantly similar analogy cannot be found, or if the severing of what we thought were causally correlated properties is not sufficient for the construction of a theory. Little discussed in the analogy literature is the possibility of using more than one analogue, in a piecemeal or modular way, to construct a new theory out of old, but previously unrelated, pieces. (This is an additional method of analogical reasoning that I will discuss and illustrate in the structure of the theory of natural selection.) Piecemeal theory construction using more than one analogy gives meaning to the cliche that creativity may result from putting old ideas together in new ways. Thus far, we have been considering an analogy as a relation between two similar analogues. An alternative analysis of what an analogy is provides us with a fourth method of theory construction. Mary Hesse, in addition to characterizing an analogy as a direct mapping between a subject and its analogue based on the similar properties, also mentioned formal analogies in which two things share only the same uninterpreted mathematical formalism. Michael Genesereth is a computer scientist who developed a partially implemented AI system called ANALOG to find and use analogies. Genesereth's system was based on an alternative analysis of what an analogy is. According to Genesereth, "many analogies are best understood as statements that the situations being compared share a common abstraction." (Genesereth 1980, p.208). Genesereth's abstractions are not merely Hesse's formal analogies, since Genesereth's abstractions may have more semantic content than an uninterpreted formalism. He gave an example: "when one asserts that the organization chart of a corporation is like a tree or like the taxonomy of animals in biology, what he is saying is that they are all hierarchies. With this view, the problem of understanding an analogy becomes one of recognizing the shared abstraction." (Genesereth 1980, p.208). (Prior AI discussion of analogy as a shared abstraction can be found in Kling, 1971; VanLehn and Brown 1980.) Genesereth shares a view explicitly discussed by the psychologist Dedre Gentner in an excellent paper entitled "The Structure of Analogical Models in Science," (1980) in which she argued that the relations between the analogue and the subject are those of identity rather than similarity, but identity at an abstract level. When Hesse mentioned that in some cases the relations between the directly mapped properties are those of identity rather than similarity, those are identity relations at the specific, not the abstract, level. Diagrams of interpretations of analogy via Hesse's direct mapping vs. Genesereth's shared abstraction are in Figure 2.</page><page sequence="6">152 Conceptually what is the relation between similarity and identity? Hesse does not provide one, but Genesereth's analysis suggests that two things are similar if, on some analysis into component properties, some of the properties are identical, while others are not identical. If this analysis is correct, then direct mapping between similar things would be decomposable into identity and difference mappings between abstracted components. Thus, one way Hesse's and Genesereth's interpretations would differ, if I am right here, is on whether the negative and neutral analogies are specified (in direct mapping) or whether only the positive analogy is represented as identity at an abstract level. (I will explore the idea of reducing similarity to identity and difference relations as we look at the Darwinian case study.) The idea of analogy as shared abstraction supplies another method of theory construction: Explicitly devise abstractions of theories or other things that might serve as analogues in theory construction. In the first stages of theory construction, search through the set of abstractions to see if an appropriate one (according to some criterion) is found. If so, then instantiate it for the case in hand. If a single abstraction is inadequate, then try to use more than one piecemeal. If piecemeal construction fails, then fall back on direct mapping to one or more specific analogues. The shared abstraction vs. direct mapping methods have various advantages and disadvantages. For computer systems, identity matches are trivial, similarity very difficult. Since the shared abstraction has a limited number of identity matches required, then it will be better. However, the shared abstraction method requires that an adequate abstraction be constructed; any given theory or object may be analyzable into numerous different abstractions. Criteria for abstraction construction would have to be devised. In both direct mapping and use of abstractions, criteria have to be devised for choosing the relevant analogue or abstraction. Direct mapping has the advantage of having the neutral analogy, perhaps even previously unexplored neutral analogy, available for further steps of theory construction. (We will see an excellent example of this use of neutral analogy in the Darwin case.) 3. Case Study: Darwinian Natural Selection Charles Darwin used numerous analogies in his scientific writings. In his exposition of the theory of natural selection, which he published in the Origin .f Species in 1859, he gave prominence to the analogy to artificial selection. Historians studying Darwin's notebooks during the original construction of the theory of natural selection have found that Darwin originally rejectd this analogy, because, among other reasons, he did not see how selection could be applied in nature. (David Kohn, personal communication). Knowledge from another source, namely Malthus's Essay on Po,ulationg provided Darwin with the mechanism of selection in nature--struggle for existence in overpopulated conditions.</page><page sequence="7">153 After arriving at the mechanism of natural selection, Darwin was able to make use of the analogy to artificial selection. Thus, Darwin's theory was not constructed using a single analogy, but has piecemeal relations to knowledge from two other areas. The actual steps that Darwin went through in constructing his theory of natural selection are more complicated than the structure discussed here. This analysis aims only at making clear the piecemeal conceptual relations presented by Darwin in the Orizin among domestic selection, natural selection, and Malthus's ideas. The relations between the components of domestic selection and natural selection can be analyzed, I will argue, into relations of identity and difference. The relations between Malthus's conclusion about human populations and a component of Darwin's theory is that of generalization: Darwin generalized to all of natural populations what Malthus had proposed for humans. Figure 3 shows the structure of the interrelations among domestic selection, natural selection and Malthus's ideas. Darwin argued that the inherited variability found in domesticated animals and plants was much like that found in nature. He needed variations that would be passed on to offspring as the raw material for species change. However, he argued that domestic forms showed "greater variability", (Darwin 1859, p.71), which I interpret to mean that the range of variants was greater. On this point of difference Darwin said: "When we look to the individuals of the same variety or subvariety of our older cultivated plants and animals, one of the first points which strikes us is, that they generally differ much more from each other, than do individuals of any one species or variety in a state of nature." (Darwin 1859, p.71). Darwin had little understanding of the causes of variation, which genetics was later to supply, but he argued that the causes of variation in nature and in domestic stocks were likely to be of the same type. Thus, evidence of the existence of variability found in domesticated stocks provided evidence for the existence of variability in nature. This portion of the analogy is actually stronger than "mere analogy": it provides inductive evidence for the existence of the kind of variability that Darwin's theory of natural selection required. The relations between variability in domestication and in nature are thus those of identity of class but difference in quantity. Presumably Hesse would say that the relation between variability in the two cases is that of similarity, but this analysis shows that similarity can be reduced to identity and difference by a decomposition into the properties being compared. Of selection Darwin said in his Autobiography: "I soon perceived that selection was the keystone of man's success in making useful races of animals and plants. But how selection could be applied to organisms living in a state of nature remained for some time a</page><page sequence="8">154 Figure 3.

(Darwin 1876, p.42). In Figure 3, I show the relations between domestic selection and what is occurring in nature to be that of a positive match at the abstracted level of some mechanism of selection operating in the two cases. But there is a negative match on the agent of selection and the criterion of selection. Darwin knew that the agent of selection had to differ in nature since human breeders could not be the agents. Also, the criterion for selection had to be such that it produced forms not adapted to human purposes but adapted to natural environments. The result of domestic selection is the origin of new varieties adapted to human purposes. By the time he wrote the Origin, Darwin took such varieties to be nascent species. Consequently, the existence of a mechanism to produce such new forms in domestic selection provided weak evidence that some similar mechanism might be operating in nature. In his Autobiograghy Darwin said: "In October 1838 ...I happened to read Malthus on Populat and being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which everywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of animals and plants, it at once struck me that under these circumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved and unfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new species. Here, then, I had at last got a theory by which to work..." (Darwin 1876, pp.42-43). The relations between Darwin's theory and Malthus's ideas are shown in Figure 3. Malthus was discussing population phenomena. At a high level of abstraction, this matches Darwin's concern with populations. But Darwin, in contrast to Malthus, was concerned with variants in a population. Malthus's major concern was to show that human populations would soon outstrip their food supply, since humans' rate of increase was greater than their ability to bring agricultural lands into cultivation. Malthus mentions, in passing, that in "the animal and vegetable kingdoms", more seeds are produced than nature has room for. (Malthus 1798, pp.71-72). Darwin generalized this to an incessant "struggle for existence" through-out nature. Thus, the relation of struggle for existence to Malthus's key idea is stronger than analogical: it is the relation of inductive generalizaion since Darwin generalized the struggle for existence from humans to all species. This analysis shows the piecemeal relations of Darwin's theory of natural selection to the analogy to domestic selection and to Malthus's ideas. The relations among the components can be analyzed into identity and difference at various levels of abstraction as well as generalization-specialization. The Darwinian case provides an excellent example of the way the analogy can be exploited in further theory construction to account for a seeming anomaly, a role that Hesse argued analogies play.</page><page sequence="10">156 Darwin was concerned with the problem of neuter insects. He said that this problem "at first appeared... insuperable, and actually fatal to my whole theory." (Darwin 1859, p.257). Since neuter insects do not reproduce, how can the characteristic of being neuter be passed on to succeeding generations; in other words, how can natural selection operate on the character of being neuter? Darwin went back to domestic selection to solve this problem. He said: "...a well-flavoured vegetable is cooked, and the individual is destroyed; but the horticulturist sows seeds of the same stock, and confidently expects to get nearly the same variety... ."I (Darwin 1859, p.258). Darwin gave several other examples from domestic breeding and then applied the principle to insects. An individual is selected from the stock that has the "tendency to produce sterile offspring" (Darwin 1859, p.259) along with fertile offspring. Thus, Darwin once again appealed to domestic selection for an additional stage of theory construction. The detailed analogue is here seen as having the advantage of possessing additional properties, not considered in the original act of theory construction, that can be used in anomaly resolution. 4. Abstract Form of Selection Theories Once Darwin had constructed the theory of natural selection he established a new type of scientific theory. Although Darwin did not do so, we may consider one way of abstracting the components of selection theories: I. An array of variants is generated. II. Selection of a subset of variants occurs. III. After selection, the pool of variants is different. Each of these abstract components can be instantiated in different ways. Some of the different possible instantiations yield alternative evolutionary theories that have actually been proposed historically. For (I), the generator or the cause of the variants will determine the number of variants, the number of different types of variants, how much each variant differs from another. Different evolutionary theories have differed in their claims about such properties of the variants. Darwin proposed numerous small variations, which he called "individual differences", as the most important type of variation that natural selection acts on. Hugo de Vries, in his Mutation Theory (1901-1903), proposed an alternative to Darwinian natural selection by proposing that large scale mutations occurred that could give rise to a new species in a single generation. Thus, the selection step played a minor role in de Vries's theory, serving merely to eliminate the least advantageous species. Mendelian genetics did not support de Vries's claim for the existence of such large scale mutations. Additional alternatives to small variants are still being</page><page sequence="11">157 proposed. Stephen Gould (1977) recently suggested that large scale changes in developmental timing may be more important in evolutionary change than small scale point mutations. According to Gould, humans have many properties of baby apes: maybe a large scale change kept our ancestors from reaching ape maturity. Selection would still operate on such developmental changes. Thus, Gould's views differ from Darwin's with respect to (I), the generation of the variants. There is a temporal relation between steps I, II and III. If step I yields certain types of variants, then step II may be unnecessary. For example, if the generator of variants had the capacity to produce only adapted variants, then the subsequent step of selection would not be necessary in either domestic or natural selection. If the second step is not needed, then the theory proposed is not a selection theory. Compare, for instance, so-called Lamarckian evolution, (Lamarck's theory was actually more complex): characters that are acquired as a result of an adaptation to an environment during the life of an individual are passed on to offspring. In such a theory, the generator of variants eliminates the need for selection. Mendelian genetics has provided no evidence for such a mechanism for the inheritance of acquired characters. Although it failed, such a so-called Lamarokian theory represents, nonetheless, an alternative type of theory to the selection type: a good analogy to human activity would be not domestic selection but human tool-making. Fashioning a tool to fit a need is analogous to an organism developing a characteristic in response to an environmental demand. The criteria that would have operated in the selection process have been incorporated into the mechanism of generation of variants; the need for the selective step is eliminated. Thus, when faced with a problem of explaining the origin of new adapted somethings, either of two abstractions can be evoked: the selection type or the tool-fashioning type. (Note at a metalevel: we have also found a way of obtaining a new abstraction: certain instantiations of parts of one abstraction may produce a new type of theory which obviates the need for the rest of the abstraction to be instantiated. A new abstraction with the tool-fashioning nature of the generator of the variants can be constructed; the new abstraction is no longer a selection theory abstraction.) For step II, the selection mechanism has subproperties which include the agent of selection (that sounds a bit anthropomorphic; perhaps a more neutral term can be found) and the criteria on the basis of which some variants are selected. Contemporary controversies about evolutionary mechanisms between neutralists (see King and Jukes 1969) and selectionists have focused on whether variants can become fixed in a population as a result of random processes rather than selection of adapted variants. Though random drift results in the pool of variants differing in succeeding generations, that pool does not share a set of characteristics as a result of a selective process. Thus, if there is no criterion for</page><page sequence="12">158 choosing among the variants (i.e., no step II) and those that survive do so because of random processes, then the theory is not a selection theory. (Note at a metalevel: once again we can construct a new abstraction by varying a step of the original abstraction. This time step II is altered.) Step III, a different array of variants, is the product of a causal mechanism operating to produce a different state of affairs at a subsequent time. In domestic and natural selection, the most important temporal dimension is the next generation of organisms; thus variability that is passed from parent to offspring, i.e., inherited variability, is the only variability important for selection. But in the abstraction of selection theories, no requirement for different generations is included. I have chosen to express the components sufficiently abstractly so that they apply to additional theories that do not include different generations of organisms but only a different pool of variants at a later time. The abstraction could be formulated at a lower level and include transmission of selected characteristics to a subsequent generation; but fewer theories would be instances of the lower level abstraction. If steps I-III, considered as a temporal process, begin a second time, with the pool of variants (or their descendants) produced by the previous run as the starting point, then selection continues in the same direction. If the criterion of selection changes (as in environmental changes), then the direction shifts. Since the generator of variants and the criterion of selection can change independently (though they may not necessarily do so in biological evolution), the range of variants produced is potentially very large. 5. Examples of Selection Theories A surprising number of different theories are specializations of the abstract type of selection theory given in steps I-III. A biological theory that fits this type beautifully is Jerne's (1955) natural selection theory of antibody formation, subsequently modified by Burnet (1957) to the theory of clonal selection for the production of antibodies. The problem is to explain how the body forms antibodies that are able to deactivate large numbers of invading foreign substances, called antigens, while not attacking the body's own substances. Jerne, in reflecting on the reasoning he used in the formation of the theory, said: "three mechanisms must be assumed: (1) a random mechanism for ensuring the limited synthesis of antibody molecules possessing all possible combining sites, in the absence of antigen, (2) a purging mechanism for repressing the synthesis of such antibody molecules that happen to fit auto-antigens, and (3) a selective mechanism for promoting the synthesis of those antibody molecules that make the best fit to any antigen entering the animal." (Jerne 1966, p.301). Jerne's theory may be expressed in our steps I-III. Jerne proposed (I) a mechanism for producing a random array</page><page sequence="13">159 of antibodies, (II) both negative selection to eliminate antibodies against bodily substances and positive selection for production of antibodies that fit an invading antigen, with the (III) result that the random array of antibodies is altered to a non-random array. Jerne's theory proposed that natural antibodies circulating through-out the body would attach to an antigen, carry it to a phagocytic cell and cause that cell to produce more antibodies like the selected one. (Jerne 1955, p.849). Although Burnet endorsed much of Jerne's theory, he objected to the mechanism of production of antibodies and proposed an alternative at the level of the cell rather than the molecule. Burnet said: the "major objection is the absence of any precedent for, and the intrinsic unlikelihood of the suggestion, that a molecule of partially denatured antibody could stimulate a cell into which it had been taken to produce a series of replicas of the molecule... It would be more satisfactory if the replicating elements essential to any such theory were cellular in character Lk initio rather than extracellular protein which can replicate only when taken into an appropriate cell... .[this idea is developed here] from what might be called the 'clonal' point of view." (Burnet 1957, p.67). Burnet proposed that the mechanism of variation was somatic mutation, namely changes within cells of the body. The selective mechanism operated by molecules on the cell surface recognizing antigens. After a type of cell recognized an antigen, it would be stimulated to reproduce into a clone of its type. Of this theory Burnet said: "Such a point of view is basically an attempt to apply the concept of population genetics to the clones of mesenchymal cells within the body." (Burnet 1957, p.68). Thus, Burnet explicitly appealed to the analogy between mutation with natural selection and his theory of somatic mutation and clonal selection. Burnet argued against a prior theory of antibody formation that was of the tool-fashioning type. (Burnet 1957, p.67). The template theory of antibody formation proposed that the body fashions an antibody on the invading antigen which serves as the template. The Jerne-Burnet selection theory, not the template theory, was subsequently confirmed and expanded. (Golub 1981). A number of other theories can be seen as selection theories. Additional historical research will be required to determine whether direct mapping to Darwin's theory of natural selection, use of the abstract type of selection theories, or other methods of theory construction played a historical role in the construction of these theories. Here I will merely call attention to the fact that their structure fits that of the abstraction for selection theories. Darwin in Th&amp; Power of Movement in Plants (1881) explained, for example, the coiling of a pea tendril around a wire as a result of natural complete circular movement of tendril being altered (selected) after encountering an object, so that subsequent movement was in the direction of the wire. The variant pool was complete</page><page sequence="14">160 circular movement, the object encountered provided the selective agent in that direction, and the altered pool was the subsequent movement only in that direction. (Ghiselin 1969, p.196). Operant conditioning works by selectively reinforcing some behaviors out of an original array to alter the subsequent behavior. The rat in a maze, for example, engages in random movements. Those in the direction of a food bar are reinforced, until the rat learns to move non-randomly. The original array of variants is thus random movement. Humans are the agents of selection, in the experimental case, and the criterion for selection is movement toward the food bar. The altered array of variants is the movement after the reinforcement. Memory plays the role of heredity in supplying the altered pool of variants on which subsequent selection steps act. Various attempts to apply selection theories to social phenomena have been made as far back as social Darwinism in the nineteenth century and as recently as sociobiology in the last few years. Whether the mechanism for producing and transmitting types of social behavior is genetic or environmental has been hotly debated. A final type of selection theory, that may be of more interest to philosophers, is that of evolutionary epistemology. Stephen Toulmin in Human Understanding argued for a view of the development of knowledge as a result of "a dual process of conceptual variation and intellectual selection." (1972, p.200). Neither Toulmin nor others within this epistemological tradition have had much to say about the mechanism for the production of new concepts. I have been arguing that use of analogical reasoning may provide a means of constrained generation of plausible new ideas that then may be selected according to the criteria scientists use for justifying theories. Whether selection-type theories or tool-fashioning theories will ultimately be of use in understanding the growth of knowledge remains to be seen. Recursive self-reference is proving to be a powerful technique in artificial intelligence. Having now come full-circle to my starting point, namely a discussion of the way analogies may be used as a mechanism to generate new ideas, it is no doubt time to stop. 6. Conclusion In conclusion, I would like to suggest that AI and philosophy of science can work together in coming to understand the heuristics in discovery or patterns of reasoning in theory construction. AI is sometimes called experimental epistemology, and I believe it holds the promise of making philosophy of science an experimental discipline. If a pattern of reasoning can be built into an AI system that can construct plausible hypotheses, then that would serve as an experimental test of the pattern. Philosophers will have to be much more precise and detailed in their specifications of patterns of reasoning if those patterns are to be implemented in AI systems.</page><page sequence="15">161 Of the methods of theory construction that I have discussed, the one that will probably be easiest to implement is theory construction by shared abstraction. Philosophers of science and people in AI could cooperate in finding types of theoies, such as the selection type and tool-fashioning type that I have mentioned. Also, they could work together in developing criteria for when a particular type is to be evoked and instantiated in a particular problem domain. The method that holds the greatest promise for producing something new or creative is the piecemeal construction using more than one analogue. New ideas often result from putting old ideas together in new ways. The implementation of piecemeal theory construction seems harder to me, but potentially very exciting. On this optimistic note for future interfield interactions, let me close. Notez I would like to thank students in my seminars on analogical reasoning at the Computer Science Department at Stanford and the Philosophy Department at Maryland for their many helpful comments on the ideas in this paper. Also helpful were comments I received at the Philosophy Departments of Vassar and American University and the Computer Science Department at Rutgers, where I presented earlier drafts. I especially thank Bruce Buchanan, Russell Greiner, Lars Rodseth, Richard Kellar, David Kohn, Louis Steinberg, and Marcia Kraft for specific comments and suggestions. I appreciate the time and space provided for research and writing over the last two years by sabbatical leave and a General Research Board Grant from University of Maryland, a visiting scholar position with the Heuristic Programming Project at Stanford, a guest account on the SUMEX-AIM computing facility, a research fellowship from the American Council of Learned Societies, and a visiting scholar position at the Department of History of Science at Harvard.</page><page sequence="16">162 Figure 4.
