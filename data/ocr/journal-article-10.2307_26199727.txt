Presented to Ralph Pinder- Wilson Edited by Warwick Ball and Len Harrow (London: Melisende, 2002), 259 pp. Price PB £25.00. ISBN 1-901764-12-5. This volume is a timely Festschrift for Ralph Pinder-Wilson, an extraordinarily knowledgeable scholar of Islamic art, but—more than that—a friend and guide over many years to large numbers of colleagues and students. After serving in the Indian army and graduating from Christ Church, Oxford, where he read Arabic and Persian, Ralph Pinder-Wilson entered the British Museum's Department of Oriental Antiquities, where he continued to curate the Museum's Islamic collection until 1976. In that year he became Director of the British Institute of Afghan Studies in Kabul. During his British Museum days, he took part in a number of archaeological projects: Harran with David Storm Rice (1959), Siraf with David Whitehouse (1966), and Fustat with George Scanlon (their combined book, Fustat Glass of the Early Islamic Period was published in 2001). But many of us remember those excavations particularly for his unique role in creating the social climate of the excavation teams, a role that brought encouragement to individuals and harmony among its members. For one academic year (1967-8) Ralph Pinder-Wilson held a Fellowship at All Souls College, Oxford, and I have happy personal memories of him and others of us being entertained by Richard and Sophie Walzer, who (supported by Samuel Stern), used to hold court in their house in north Oxford, surrounded by their remarkable collection of paintings. The atmosphere was a curious mixture of warm hospitality and scholarly erudition, and it was good to have Pinder-Wilson's unpretentious friendly presence when the conversation became too highbrow for the lowbrow among us! In the Introduction, Warwick Ball has compiled some delightful personal reflections by contributors to the book and by others, which show just how much Pinder-Wilson is appreciated and loved by those around him. The articles in this volume well reflect his broad interests. There is a major group on the architecture of Afghanistan and neighbouring areas: 'The Towers of Ghur: A Ghurid "Maginot Line"?' by Warwick Ball; 'The Pillar and the Pictures: An Interpretation of the "Diwan-i Khass" at Fathpur Sikri' by Barbara Brend; 'Between Ghazna and Delhi: Lahore and its Lost manara' by Barry Flood; 'The Ghurid Tomb at Herat' by Robert Hillenbrand; and 'The Tomb of Ghiyath al-Din at Tughluqabad: Pise Architecture of Afghanistan Translated into Stone in Delhi' by Mehrdad and Natalie Shokoohy. These make the book a significant source for anyone interested in the Islamic architecture of the area. Also in the field of architecture is Paddy Baker's 'A Mirror on the Soul: Persian Architectural Glass'. Then there is a wide sweep of articles on Islamic minor arts, which remind us of Pinder-Wilson's own contributions to scholarship, especially in his magnificent article on the Reliquary of St Petroc, and others on metalwork.

There are also articles reflecting Pinder-Wilson's interest in painting, inscriptions, and sculpture: 'Fragments of Drawing and Paintings from Fustat' by Edmond de Unger; 'The Sculptures of the Pre-Islamic Haram at Mecca' by Geoffrey King; 'The Rabatak Inscription and the Nameless Kushan King' by David MacDowall; 'Pem Nem: A 16th Century Dakani Manuscript' by David Matthews; 'Princes and Heroes of Bandar-i Taheri—A Late Qajar Fort and the Shahnameb' by Jennifer Scarce; 'A Manuscript of Mir-'Ali al-katib: A Poem on the Duties of Prayer' by Annemarie Schimmel; and 'The Illustrations of Baghdad 282 in the Topkapi Sarayi Library in Istanbul' by Eleanor Sims. Three further articles, on ethnography, complete the volume: 'The Armenians of Kabul and Afghanistan' by Jonathan Lee; 'The Ethnogenesis of the Pashtuns' by Willem Vogelsang; and 'Echoes in a Landscape: Western Afghanistan in 1989' by Bruce Wannell. Sadly, no bibliography of Ralph Pinder-Wilson's own contributions to scholarship is included in the volume, but otherwise it is a valuable publication. Its emphasis on Afghanistan is unusual, and is itself a reminder of how little we know about Afghan material culture in Islamic times. Its major strength is perhaps its group of architectural studies. I was particularly fascinated by Warwick Ball's discussion of the fortifications of the Ghurid kingdom, and the 'passing literary reference' to a Ghaznavid manara in Lahore discussed by Barry Flood. But there are other fascinating articles here too, not least 'Beasts that Roared', which suggests that the Pisa Griffin and other such metal statues may once have emitted frightening sounds. Whether these were to impress ambassadorial visitors, or amuse the ruler's boon companions, is uncertain, but it is sad in a way that the Walzers did not have one for their soirees\ James Allan School of Oriental and African Studies</page></plain_text>
