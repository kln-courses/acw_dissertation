<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS MILLIN BAY: A LATE NEOLITHIC CAIRN IN CO. DOWN. By A. E. P. Collins and D. M. Waterman. Archaeological Research Publications (Northern Ireland), No. 4, Pp. 84; 19 plates and 16 line illustrations. Belfast, H.M. Stationery Office, 1955. 18s. THis is a first-class monograph descriptive of a first-class excavation of a most remarkable site. The Millin Bay cairn, with its contained burial chamber, ancillary burials and enclosing walls is in itself unique, though the authors are able to define something of its position in the known series of chambered tombs of the British Isles. The site was full of surprises, and the detailed presentation of all its features in the present volume constitutes an important contribution to prehistoric archaeology. The oval cairn, which before excavation showed no features save for a few projecting stones, was found to have been built on top of a stretch of earlier stone wall, of quite unknown purpose, but suggestive of some form of land division in arable or pasture. Within a double revetment of orthostats the cairn contained a long stone cist constructed in an elongated pit: within the inner enclosing wall was also an empty square cist, and in the space between the outer revetment wall and the large orthostats which were set round the base of the mound were a further eight cists, four containing cremated bones. A few other scattered cremated bone deposits were also found. The central long cist contained the re-buried bones of at least 16 individuals. No grave-goods were found, but flints including a piece of a polished axe, and sherds of a bowl of the Loughcrew type of Neolithic pottery were found in primary contexts. Over thirty of the stones used in the construction of the features within the cairn, and loose within it, had pecked or incised patterns upon them.</page><page sequence="2">142 REVIEWS Typologically, the authors assign this monument to a place somewhere within the culture represented by the Clyde-Carlingford chambered tombs of Ulster and adjacent regions, and probably this is as far as we can go at present. The placing of the long cist in a sunken pit, however, is something peculiar, and one can hardly help thinking of the similar construction of French gallery-graves in the Paris Basin, and less frequently elsewhere, and of the Scandinavian 'long cists' of the Late Neolithic, similarly set in pits. The stones decorated with incised patterns at Millin Bay might be connected with the use of this technique at Lyles Hill and elsewhere, but the pecked designs are degenerate versions oi patterns within the Boyne Culture repertoire, some (e.g. no. 8) still preserving the remnants of an anthropomorphic design. The pottery, too, would be appropriate to a Boyne Culture setting. The burial rites were studied in some detail, notably by Dr. W. R. M. Morton and Dr. J. H. Scott, who examined the bones in situ as well as in the laboratory, and who contribute a valuable study forming Part II of the report under review. One of the most fascinating points is the evidence of re-burial after the complete decay of the flesh from the bodies afforded by teeth which had been replaced in the sockets from which they had fallen, but replaced wrongly. This precise observation could only have been made in circumstances in which an anatomist could examine the material during excavation-a moral to all of us. The Millin Bay monument clearly combines features from more than one Late Neolithic tradition, and not least interesting is the presence of cremation burial. The authors discuss this at some length, and the writer of this review is delighted to find their views in accordance with those he was forming as a result of a quite separate line of enquiry. There seems no doubt that we must recognise the emergence, in Late Neolithic times in the British Isles, of a tradition of grouping burnt burials into what we can only call cremation-cemeteries, within a mound or in the open. Such cremation-cemeteries run without a break into the Bronze Age, side-by-side with the intrusive tradition of single-grave burial associated with Beaker and allied cultures, and in our Middle Bronze Age become, side-by-side with cremated burial under a mound, the dominant funerary rite. The distribution of such Bronze Age cremation-cemeteries falls mainly within the Highland Zone of Britain, and in Ireland: many have been relegated to the Late Bronze Age in the past, on the grounds of a pottery typology based on Abercromby which will not in fact bear critical examination. We must be prepared for the early appearance of the cremation rite, and for cremation - cemeteries, and similarly for the early appearance of pot types such as that represented by the cordoned urn, indistinguishable in essential features from Class II ware at Lough Gur. Millin Bay gives us yet another cremation-cemetery in a Late Neolithic context. The production and presentation of this report is in the very highest traditions of British archaeology. In Mr. Waterman we have one of the finest and most sensitive draughtsmen in the archaeological field, who can produce an accurate and informative plan or section which is also a work of art, and in Mr. Collins a skilled and perceptive photographer. These matters of visual presentation are not to be under-rated; a clear and economically written text must go side-by-side with an equal lucidity of illustration. In the Millin Bay report we have both. STUART PIGGOTT.</page></plain_text>
