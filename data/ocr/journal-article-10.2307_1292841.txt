<plain_text><page sequence="1">something to interest every biologist, not only for plant pathologists, but also for specialists in such related sciences as genetics, physiology, and biochemistry; and indeed, there is much for young students of biology. The book has an important place in the literature of plant pathology and of other biological sciences. Carefully, and to a degree philosophically, it de- velops the history of plant pathology and projects its future. The book is in ten parts. Each part is devoted to a major division of the science. Most of the book-parts two through ten-contains the papers pre- sented before the nine symposia of the Anniversary meeting. There are six papers on physiology, seven on genet- ics, seven on fungicides and the chem- istry of fungicides, six on fungi, five on nematology, eight on the structure and the multiplication of viruses, and five on epidemiology. The authors of these papers are among the most distinguished in their own fields. For example, G. J. M. van der Kerk, of the Institute for Organic Chemistry, The Netherlands, con- tributes a paper on the "Chemical Structure and Fungicidal Activity of Dithiocarbamic Acid Derivatives," and Gerhard Schramm, of the Max Planck Institute for Virus Research, Germany, discusses "The Role of the Nucleic Acid in the Infection with Tobacco Mosaic Virus." It is significant that these two con- tributors came from foreign lands. Twenty-one of the 44 papers included in the symposia were presented by scientists brought here from England, Australia, South Africa, Germany, The Netherlands, Honduras, Mexico, and Canada. Part One of the Golden Jubilee vol- ume contains the seven major ad- dresses concerned with the history and development of plant pathology. Again, the prestige of the authors and the quality of their papers are outstanding. E. C. Stakman of the University of Minnesota relates plant pathology to the world's scientific and social development; John A. Stevenson of the United States Department of Agriculture traces the development of the science in North America; and J. G. Harrar of the Rockefeller Foun- dation discusses an international ap- proach to the study and control of plant diseases. Other contributors to this section are S. E. A. McCallan and George L. McNew of the Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Re- search, J. C. Walker of the University of Wisconsin, and James G. Horsfall of the Connecticut Agricultural Ex- periment Station. All in all, "Plant Pathology" reflects much credit on the various commit- tees of the Society that were respon- sible for the presentation and publi- cation of these papers, the contents of which point to the significant role of biological sciences in the future of mankind. The editors and publisher should be complimented on the production of this book which not only is very read- able but also is handsomely bound in gold. Paul R. Miller, Crops Research Division, U. S.

Were an ichthyologist to see the title of this handsome book before he saw the volume itself, there is a good chance that he would consider it no further. Obviously not even a work many times this size could treat ex- haustively with all tropical fishes, let alone those known to be suited for en- joyment in aquaria. Nevertheless, the choice and extent of the information included in this substantial volume are most satisfying, even to a pro- fessional fish biologist. The offering is furthermore greatly enriched by more than three hundred photographs, (by Brian Barrett) including more than a hundred excellently reproduced in color. The value of the illustrations is strongly enhanced by the prevalent inclusion of both sexes, with their careful designation. In capsule form, these plates offer one of the richest displays of sexual dimorphism in the animal world. Nearly a third of "All about tropical fish" is an aquarist's vade mecum. Ob- vious care was taken, however, not only to provide instructions for build- ing, setting up, and maintaining aquaria, but also to creating under- standing of an aquarium as an eco- system. Indeed, the first thirteen chap- ters are a skilful digest of information on the physiological ecology of fishes and the manipulation of an aquarium environment to meet the needs of finny inhabitants chosen for it. Chapter titles encompass the follow- ing subjects: choice, setting, and maintenance of aquaria; aquarium limnology; dietetics of aquarium fishes; enemies, diseases, and humane treatment of animals; aquatic plants; biology of fishes; freshwater tropical aquarium fishes of more than twenty families; miscellaneous tropical ma- rines. The chapter on "Kindness and cruel- ties" is really quaint in its naivete, although to some readers it may be annoyingly anthropomorphic. For example, "bullies abound in the fish world, as they do elsewhere" and "few aquarists realize the terror instilled into their pets by unskilled catching." Disposal of aquarium fish by flushing them down the toilet is regarded as "extremely cruel"!. Although this work was obviously aimed at aquarists, it contains much of value for the student and the re- searcher in ichthyology as well as for teachers of ichthyology and behavioral biology. Considering the profusion of fishes (estimates of species numbers go as high as 40,000), relatively little information exists concerning most of them. Exceptions to this are most common among the food and game species and, as the present work so ably demonstrates, in the many aquarium kinds. In this book, there is a wealth of comparative, guideline information on such diverse subjects as courtship, nurture in relation to fecundity, gestation period, territori- ality, genetics, change of habits with life history stage, principles of ani- mal coloration (including sexual dichromatism), thermal and chemical preferenda, and space and nutritional requirements. It is a worthy addition to a field of literature long dominated in the English language by the works of Innes (e.g., "Exotic Aquarium Fishes"), and Stoye ("Tropical Fishes for the Home Their Care and Propa- gation"). Much of the observational and experimental data included are firsthand experiences and are addi- tions in fact to the knowledge of the groups represented. K. F.

(1959) $5.50. *Function of the Human Body. AR- THUR C. GUYTON. 584 pp., illus. W. B. Saunders Company, Philadel- phia, Pa. (1959). These two college texts represent a field of biology teaching which on the secondary school level has been usurped by the non-biology oriented teacher, and the same trend is now appearing in the colleges. The Turner book is a standard col- lege health text of long standing in its latest revision. There is still an emphasis on human anatomy with some physiology included. Each chap- ter seems to begin with an anatomical treatment followed by its health as- pects. There is an interesting appen- dix explaining common prefixes and suffixes found in medicine. Also, there is a long and extensive treatment of common diseases included as an appendix. AIBS Bulletin * April 1960 47</page></plain_text>
