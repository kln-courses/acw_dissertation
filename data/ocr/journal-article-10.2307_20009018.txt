VALONE Department of Philosophy, Bellarmine College, Louisville, KY 40205 Theodore W. Adorno, Against epistemology: A metacritique, trans, by Willis Domingo. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press, 1983. This series of reflections is written in Adorno's characteristically intense and concrete style and harbors thematics and strands of thought that weave a fuller picture than first appears. This essay, selected from manuscripts written soon after his emigration to England, is Adorno's attempt to show how epistemology betrays experience. The author employs Husserl's work as a model in his anticipation of the movement announcing the end of epistemolo? gy. Adorno is not bashful in his considerations of Husserl, placing in a critical light Husserl's assurances that pure phenomenology is not epistemology. Moreover, he restricts himself to Husserl's published texts with a decided preference for the earlier work. Adorno regards Husserl's later phenomenology as a betrayal, a form of philosophical treason wherein he slips into a modified Neo-Kan tianism. The essay addresses the antinomy within the Husserlian search for a pure beginning, a presuppositionless start. The issue is not what the content of the final ground is but the very concept and legitimacy of such a foundation. This philosophical compulsion must be identified and broken. Adorno argues that the search for a first and fundamental principle involves antinomy. Every first principle must be uni? versal and contains abstraction in it. The first, as a concept, is always mediated and therefore not the first. The principle, how? ever, must guarantee completeness; it is regarded as all-encom? passing. The method necessary to carry on this Husserlian project separates itself from what it intends to provide access. It does this by posing itself as the model and absolute. What appears here epistemologically is at the same time socially the split between mental and physical labor.</page><page sequence="2">88 This project, in Adorno's estimation, is self-defeating. The com? pulsion for certainty labors under its own self-destruction. For such an epistemology, truth is persistence. Yet, as Adorno points out, it is a fallacy to model truth on what persists rather than what perishes. The historical is removed as integral to consciousness. The new ontology is abstract and a renewal of idealism and false consciousness. The aura of the concrete attaches itself to the concept for subjectively mediated determinations are credited to whatever completely lacks the subjective, as qualities of its being-in-itself. The phenomenological intuition of essences is portrayed as if every individual concept had an unshakeable essence without reference to the others and their constellations. Here the illusion of concretization is maintained. Finally, the concept of the first also collapses that of the ab? solutely new which phenomenology advocates but without issuing new themes. Thus, the fantasy and illusion of the genuinely new is preserved through a dialectics that preserves the old. Adorno announces it is now time for last philosophy, a praxis of phi? losophy and not merely a philosophy of praxis. Within this framework and perspective of regarding phenome? nology and its epistemological model as antinomy-producing, Adorno embarks on a critique of some specific thematics within Husserlian phenomenology that exemplify more concretely the general points he is making. These thematics include: a critique of logical absolutism; species and intention; epistemological con? cepts in dialectic; and essence and pure ego. Adorno's deconstruction Adorno begins his critique of Husserl's logical absolutism (Chapter 1) by pointing to the contradiction between philosophy and the sciences, already implicit in Aristotle but explicit since Descartes. On the one hand, philosophy seeks to think the unconditioned and to transcend the accepted existence of the sciences. Yet, on the other hand, philosophy takes science as the model. So it either enters the arena of science only to become absorbed by them or to so separate itself that it becomes ineffective and power? less. So either ph?osophy tears itself from the division of labor, and therefore becomes impotent or obsolete with respect to existing productive forces, or as a science it becomes a mere imitation, losing its proper project at its most crucial point, at the juncture of critique. Absorbed by science, philosophy becomes subject to the form of organization of science. Captured by the cult of methodology it abides by the rules and functions of scientific</page><page sequence="3">89 organization of knowledge and loses sight of its own object and goal. Adorno identifies Husserl's attempt to break the "spell of reification" by addressing philosophically "the things in them? selves" as a project in harmony with science. Husserl, at once, sub? mits science to philosophical critique and acknowledges it as the ideal of ph?osophy. The author is aware that Husserl does see that practice and association are essential and not accidental moments of every logical accompUshment. But Husserl seeks to derive practice and association from "imprinted" law-likeness of logical form. Adorno sees this reification of logic as a forgetfulness of its grounds and thereby undermining a genuine ontology. Adorno identifies contingency as the enemy of Husserl, to be driven out of his program for a first philosophy that would ground all. He sees Husserl proceeding according to the dictum that if the facts do not obey ideas, all the worse for the facts. In this fear Husserl overestimates the arbitrariness of the life of consciousness no less than its opposite number, the being-in-itself of the laws of thought. Hidden in the very concept of objectivity is the concept from which it draws its very model, the concept of an object, the world. The truth and objectivity of absolutism is but a chimera, a reflection, of the grounds and process of truth. It is an illusion passed off as unconditional truth and being. Husserl's absolutistic doctrine of logic is related to his doctrine of intentions and it is to this that Adorno turns in Chapter 2. In this latter doctrine the notion of isolated "lived experiences" was developed and corresponded to the equally isolated "unreal" sense impUcates meant by the act. Husserl interprets the act directed to the 'abstract moment' of content as the intuition of the species. But, as Adorno points out, any perception experienced as self-identical, for instance any particular red perceived, is not already the species, that is, the species red. The model for Husserl's construction of essence is the assumption of an act sense which is solid in itself, unvarying and free of dynamics. The mechanism of Husserlian ontology is isola? tion, the very scientific-classificatory technique which Husserl's opposes. Adorno claims that Husserl overcomes the paradox of deriving and obtaining the unconditional from the givenness of factual states-of-affairs by conferring immediacy upon subjective media? tion and giving to thought the illusion of a straightforward aware? ness (unmediated) of states-of-affairs. There is only a semblence of the dialectical process of thought and the mediation of con? cept, object, meaning, and states-of-affairs. He overcomes the paradox by abstracting from the very states-of-affairs he posits as his starting point.</page><page sequence="4">90 Even with regard to Husserl's notion of eidetic variation, it is not a multiplicity of individuals that is required for the constitu? tion of the eidos of the object. Rather, for any single individual, the consciousness of the essence which pervades it comes through the free activity of fantasy or fiction. Adorno claims that Husserl goes far beyond received idealism. To claim that something could stand in for the infinity of its possibilities is hardly possible for anything material. The author's critique of the Husserlian notion of intentionality has disclosed its abolition of the dialectical process of thought. This epistemological fissure is the topic of the third chapter. Here Adorno argues that the apparent novelty and impartiality embedded in the phenomenological dictum "to the things them? selves!" arises from an epistemological norm. It attributes the substance of cognition to what is supposed to exist without the supplement of thought. This epistemological slight of hand actual? ly cloaks a positivistic norm. It seeks a disclosure of the givenness and immediacy of experience without encountering the complexi? ties of mediating processes of consciousness. Instead it posits structures of pure consciousness that are not really descriptions of conscious and cognitive processes. Husserl attributes immediate givenness to what is meant when, in fact, everything meant is mediated by meaning. The conclusion of a truly dialectical logic is forbidden to Husserl, that is, a logic that maintains as well as negates the concept of the immediate. Husserl must give even the "pre-given lived experiences" and the "datum of Uved experience" the status of an entity in itself. Husserl is forgetful of the fact that all reflection on lived expe? riences is mediated through the concept of reflection. His talk and reference to reflection on lived experiences presupposes the reifi? cation of the concept of givenness. Phenomenology, thereby, loses any possibility of its being a force for critique in the face of this absolutely given independent of one's own work, yet not to be presupposed. Adorno recognizes, however, that Husserl did touch upon the temporal and progressive character of meaning constitution and truth claims, where va?dity is tied to genesis and the content of this genesis and its processes. Pushed to its fullness of insight, truth in this latter conception becomes reciprocal dependence, the mutual production of subject and object. The dialectical character of knowing would be retrieved. Yet the search for the given phenomenologically is in vain. This is so, for analysis constantly finds itself confronting struc? tures that transcend such givenness. Husserl never reflects on the process that effects mediation. Blindness to the process of production, says Adorno, lures him into taking the product as</page><page sequence="5">91 given. Social forces govern this reification and abstraction. "Al? ready with Husserl is evident, in the most inner cells of episte? mology, that fetishization of the currently existing, which in the era of overproduction extends, with the simultaneous fettering of the forces of production, over the total social consciousness (p. 141)." In light of his thoroughgoing treatment of perception and pas? sivity in Husserl's epistemology, Adorno points to an additional antinomy. Despite the object's pure self-givenness and immediate givenness, it is distinct from and mediated by the 'act.' This is possible only if the object is present in itself before all critical analysis. There is, increasingly, in the doctrine of intentionality, an alienation of the subjectively intended object from what in? tends or thinks. Adorno is harsh and pointed in his critique. He draws out what he sees as the sociology and social theory of Husserl. He claims that the known has value for phenomenology only in its inhumani? ty, in a forgetfulness of humans and human existence. ... Phenomenology mercilessly sequesters meaning and inten? tion (Meinen und Meinung) from those who mean and intend ; it sequesters the given from the giver and feels its objectivity all the more fundamentally secured, the more it forgets exis? tence (p. 221). Self-evidence, which is an illusion, is possible because the subjective moment, the phenomenologically pure ego, and the objective moment, the eidetically reduced concepts, are equally sealed off against facticity and are regarded as sufficient unto themselves. The ontology embedded in phenomenology is idealis? tic and deprives that ontology from contact with the very grounds of its sense and meaning, concrete evidence. In his movement to the final chapter, where he attends to the issues of essence and pure ego in Husserlian epistemology, Adorno is fair to Husserl. He criticizes Husserl's successors both for relegating him to the backrooms of intellectual history after pillaging his thought of ideas and for unfairly and incorrectly approaching him for concepts he did not hold. But despite the recognition of these intellectual injustices the author proceeds with his own critique. Husserl did not provide the material analyses nor an adequate articulation of the theory of essential insight that one would expect from such a key con? cept. His treatment of this in Ideas I and Logical Investigations are cursory. The ideal of Husserlian philosophy is one of absolute security based on the model of private property. This security is caught in the reduction of essences to the world of consciousness.</page><page sequence="6">92 The paradox and antinomies of ideaUstic phenomenology could only be sublated if consciousness were to finally rule over being. But idealism asserts the grounded as founded in consciousness and not in the material historical conditions and relations among selves. Constructive reflections This is a very difficult work to read because it is comprised mainly of notes and its contents are pregnant with unclarified meaning and nuances. This is compUcated by the akeady difficult style of Adorno. He tends to avoid technical jargon but his style some? times inhibits ready comprehension even to those well versed in the traditions involved and the work cited. The choice of lan? guage and style was practically a moral decision for Adorno and his rather abrupt sentence structure and use of anthropomorphic predicates reflect his conviction that concepts have a Ufe linked to society and independent of any individual mind and their logical status at a given time. Yet, as the translator writes: "Ador? no's style is certainly far from limpid, but only those who have trouble reading anything at all make clarity their highest value (p. 237)." The kind of approach and style he uses, a type of philosophical skirmishing where he attacks with vigor and philosophical acumen specific points in Husserl, is extremely effective. While Adorno attends to and makes his readers focus on specific points, one never loses sight of the total picture. He continually, but in an undistracting way, keeps the larger picture in front of us: the demise of epistemology and the problems it is riddled with as a result of contemporary social relations. It is clearly a work unto itself. Yet it leaves one hungry for a clear statement and resitu ating of the issues and questions regarding consciousness, knowing, objectivity, etc. The end of traditional and idealist epistemology can hardly be identified with the end of all epistemology. Clearly, Adorno's work is primarily a critique and, at times, a diatribe against epistemology. Yet one would hope and would want to see a constructive side to this project. What, is anything, would be a constructive and constitutive account of knowledge and its formations? While I cannot do fuU justice to the question of a constructive response to Adorno's critique, some tempering of his position is in order. In doing so, a few substantive issues will be addressed and an outline is offered of what a positive and constructive ap? proach would hope to be. First of all, there is a good deal to be said in favor of Adorno's</page><page sequence="7">93 interpretation of Husserlian phenomenology as idealistic. Ideas I at first glance is not idealistic for it preserves the distinction be? tween being and pure consciousness. But the original position changes in the course of the work. Reality is defined as some? thing only intended 'and beyond that as nothing' (p. 91) and by extending the essence of consciousness into the noematic sphere. When phenomenology moves from the description of particular regions of consciousness and phenomena to a discussion of the basic nature of all consciousness and phenomena the idealist tendency surfaces. This jeopardizes the contrary yet basic Hus? serlian notion of the self-consistency and independence of the concrete. Yet it is doubtful that Husserl finally let the absolute character of consciousness eclipse the importance of the con? crete and the presence of other subjects and things. Husserl seems to move between the view of consciousness as possessing an ab? solute position vis-?-vis contents that are relative and the view that consciousness and its acts are correlates of objectivities, which would not give consciousness an absolute position. Much of Husserl's work has idealistic overtones especially his later writings. Nonetheless, this strain in his thought should not lead us to overlook the distinctive character of Husserl's way of doing philosophy. It seems that Husserl, especiaUy in Ideas I, does encompass all of Being as the Being of consciousness. Even if we interpret what Husserl means by Being as the Being of meaning then Being is encompassed by meaning. This ignores the methodological assumptions appearing in the use of phenomenology as a method ? the meaning the world has for us, and our thought and experi? ence have for us bring a sense of existence. Each event, experience, or object is meant as existing in some way. So good phenomenolo? gy will in effect consider the existential sense each world has for us whUe we attend to that world. The phenomenologist can and should ask: What kind of exis? tence is disclosed? What is the existential status of the objects which are experienced by us in each of our worlds? What is the existential sense of the world for us? If the world is inteUigible and meaningful, as the phenome? nologist would have it, then this metaphysical assumption throws phenomenology into a dilemma. How can the phenomenologist claim that the world is pre-scientifically and pre-philosophically meaningful since there is no possibility to speak about reality in the strong sense of the term. This strong sense asserts that there are entities which are meaningful independent of any and all human consciousness. Phenomenology seems driven back to an idealism. Phenomenology appears to reject the possibility of</page><page sequence="8">94 reality without humans. There is some phenomenologically oriented ph?osophy, including parts of Husserl's work, which warrants this criticism. Phenomenology's avoidance of the "real? ism" of a world-in-itself and its shrinking from an idealism of a world-as-content-of-the-subject is fundamentally a sound posi? tion. Phenomenology does not speak of things as they are in themselves but as they are related to us in terms of meaning. Meaning must be seen in its relationship to humans, for it is through human consciousness alone that meaning can appear. "Realism" in the strong sense tends to reduce all being and its meaning to "brute reaUty" and to the "in-itself." The represen? tational concept of knowing is the epistemological consequence of making the distinction between truth in-itself and "truth as a human possession." Yet if what is meaningful and true reveals itself in the human, grasp of it, then it makes little sense to speak of "truth-in-itself." It would be a mistake, however, to claim that phenomenology rejects a reaUstic consciousness of reality simply because it rejects the representational reaUsm of the natural attitude. Once seen as intentional, consciousness no longer needs to be treated in either the framework of idealism ox realism. As a being directed-toward, consciousness is not a container, within which or outside of which the world is present. If we must insist on using the terminology of inside/outside, the world as outside consciousness can only be known as outside in and through con? sciousness, and consciousness as inside can only be experienced as that process through which the world outside is disclosed. Objections to phenomenology that claim that there is a world without humans presuppose the very subjectivity which they claim is not present in their claim. In speaking and disclosing meaning, we are not the masters of meaning; we do not create meaning, for we create no being. For the phenomenologist, the term "is" has meaning and reaUy says something only in affir? mation. In affirmation being manifests itself as being present, as being-for-the-subject. Nevertheless, Adorno is correct in pointing to the paradoxical character of Husserl's conception of philosophy. The reification of logic and ph?osophy takes place because it is an abstraction from the very facticity whose essential structures it is meant to clarify and thereby effectively separating the content of science from its essential structures. Moreover, Adorno has, as a result of his reflections, raised a serious question about the doctrine of essences. Has ambiguity and does ambiguity exhibit itself to such an extent that there are no universal eidetic patterns, only groups of things character? ized by family resemblances? Again, it is not possible to reopen</page><page sequence="9">95 the Pandora's Box of essentialism. But I would like to suggest an alternative interpretation of the Husserlian notion of essence and also suggest, taking my cue from Adorno, resituating the basis for epistemological work. Our experience of the Ufe-world and the Ufe-world that is experienced is neither totally unambiguous nor totally present at any one moment. However, essence is a structure of the life-world and consciousness which makes it possible for any particular "what" or "that" to be known. Essences are idealizations of typicalities within the Ufe-world. Conceived in this way essences are not merely discovered through the method of eidetic variation. They are constituted through a process of idealization. Essences are dialectically related to empirical prototypes. Essences, then, are not conditions for the possibility of empirical types. Rather, they fuUy exp?cate the impUcit rationality pre-formed in the empirical types. However, this reconsideration of the doctrine of essences also calls for reconsidering the grounds for an epistemology. The point is to resituate epistemological considerations on the levels of sociahty and action, employing these as the paradigms of knowl? edge rather than perception. Instead of the individual constituting his or her universe of meaning, consciousness emerges in a situa? tion where meaning is akeady constituted. Given the primordiahty of intersubjectivity, of a world already given as common to aU, the philosopher as well as the person in the natural attitude are provided an access to the social which may not itself be given conceptuaUy but is nonetheless the pos? sibility for articulating processes of reasoning and meaning-con? stitution. The primordial sociahty is both a givenness and a mak? ing, a givenness that allows us to find it as shareable. The person in the natural attitude and the philosopher could not hope to know anything of the world, history, and society unless the very basis of social experience was a mutuality, a sharing, an experience of the "We." The constitution and discovery of meaning (whether on the level of action in the natural attitude or the theoretical praxis of the philosopher) and the objective conditions of sociali? ty are possible not because each of us always creates the meaning, conditions, or consequences of our actions (conditions and conse? quences of which we may not even be aware), but because they are essentiaUy social acts, shareable, and constituted in and through the intentional activities of a community of conscious beings. Experience of the social world as a continuous reality is based not only on our conceptualizations of it but also on the pre conceptual givenness and non-conceptual acceptance that the social world will continue to be as we experience it and that I as well as others will continue to be as we experience them.</page><page sequence="10">96 This givenness and acceptance of the world as social and thus shareable does not make the world pub?c and meaningful be? cause we beUeve or accept it as so, rather our beUef and accep? tance of the "We" aUows us to find the world already meaning? ful and social. As consciousness o/the world wh?e a consciousness in it, human subjectivity finds itself as already social, directed toward the other than itself. Consciousness of the world we are in allows us to recognize that what we become conscious of as participants in society and the life-world as well as students of both is disclosed to us in virtue of the fact that our consciousness is already in a social world, in a world experienced by those in it as shareable and common. Clearly, we would be equally remiss in ignoring Adorno's insights, as we would be in accepting the demise of epistemology, anticipated in his reflections. It is worth pursuing the point about the grounds of an epistemology being torn out from under itself. But this alienation is rooted to a great extent in ignoring the need for the mutually necessary tasks of epistemology, ontology and metaphysics. It is no wonder that epistemology has appeared to be in a death march, for it has been torn from any possible grounds of the Uved experiences and contexts that would define, shape, and materia?ze the conditions of knowing. This does not mean that all is lost. The self-absorb tion reflected in ph?osophy since Descartes has, on the positive side, furnished analyses both fruit? ful and necessary in reveaUng the processes of consciousness, the unconscious, self-deception, and, as a result, enriched our under? standing of the role of the knower in the knowing process. But contemporary ph?osophy tends to begin with epistemology and not the metaphysics and ontology that the Western ph?osophical world has either discouraged, ignored, or out and out denied as meaningful. The need to return to the originary experiences of human activity and consciousness encompasses the need to return to those aspects of the ph?osophical enterprise that pertain to these originary experiences. We must continually make efforts to articulate the sense and importance of metaphysics, ontology, and, perhaps even more centrally, a ph?osophical anthropology worth its name. Only by bu?ding a new ph?osophical ethos can we hope to ac compUsh the task of renewing these needed ph?osophical efforts and, in the long run, achieve the analyses, dialogue, as well as the social change needed and favored by the critiques and critics of the traditions since Greece. If we return to the still valid findings and conclusions of phenomenology, and place them in this new and wider framework of an ontology, metaphysics, and epis? temology which correct, expand, and refound its orientation, then phenomenology can continue to contribute to the telos of reason.</page><page sequence="11">97 References Husserl, E.
