<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mirbeau's Hedgehog Christopher D. Lloyd Unflatteringly, it is the primitive insectivores, represented by the hedgehogs, which are the ancestors of the modern pri mates (which includes monkeys, apes and man). Stephen Walker, Animal Thought} Small mammals and their links with humankind fascinated Octave Mirbeau (1848-1917), as the long extract printed immediately after this article shows. A reader previously unfamiliar with this author's work is likely to react to this contribution to hedgehog lore with a mixture of amusement, surprise and irritation or bewilderment. Two possible guides to interpretation can be found in other, later texts. A chapter of La 628-E8 (1907) is called 'La Faune des routes' and tells us about the creatures encountered along the roadside as the narrator journeys through Northern Europe in his motor car. He comments: "J'ai, pour les animaux, une tendresse de neurasthénique et de misanthrope. Leurs souf frances me font horreur" (274).2 Nonetheless, the motor car invariably brings death and destruction to most animals that cross its path. And in the first chapter of Dingo (1913), when the narrator receives a mysteri ous parcel that turns out to contain the eponymous antipodean canid, he remarks: "J'ai l'horreur des mystifications et je manque de l'esprit qu'il faut pour en rire" (15). It would be a mistake to overintellectualize Mirbeau and to present him as a writer of coruscating paradoxes and ironies, when in fact he was essentially a journalist who wrote directly and forcefully, avoid ing stylistic obscurities. Nevertheless, he had a quirky and quixotic imagination, and considerable fondness for rapid changes of rhetorical tone and ideological position. His contradictions may make his en gagement rather suspect, but they are continually engaging. The narra tor of La 628-E8 professes horror at animals' suffering, and then pro ceeds to recount with considerable detail and relish the number of dogs he has managed to run over. The horror of mystification expressed in Dingo is itself a mystifying denial, since the whole book is written in a fantaisiste manner, immediately switching for example to a parody of scientific taxonomies and evolutionary theories that offer reductive explanations for civilized customs. One is at first surprised to learn too that many of the events presented as part social documentary, part au tobiography are entirely fabricated. Moreover, Mirbeau may never 149</page><page sequence="2">150 Nineteenth-Century French Studies have owned a dingo at all; nor indeed may he have actually written a sizeable part of the novel himself. Thus we are presented with a whole series of mystifications, of which this is perhaps the ultimate mystifi cation. One needs to proceed, then, in a spirit of light-hearted caution. The narrator of La 628-E8 categorizes himself as a "misanthrope," suggest ing in other words that his affection for animals is set against a corre sponding dislike for the human species. He is also a "neurasthénique," with all its slightly sinister and mysterious fin-de-siècle connotations of neurotic obsession and physiological morbidity. The hedgehog story, I should add, is taken from the beginning of Les 21 Jours d'un neurasthénique (1901). Mirbeau's mammals may be observed with ten derness, but they usually come—often literally—to a sticky end. What I want to show about Mirbeau through some examples of his fauna falls into three areas, which commentators who perceive him as a polemical journalist with anarchist leanings tend to overlook. First of all, Mirbeau is a great humorist, contributing memorably to a genre that flourished around 1900. Secondly, his fascination with the natural world (he was a keen amateur botanist), with the conflict between men and beasts, or man and the beast, between frustrated idealism and ago nized materialism, obviously links him to Zola and naturalism as a lit erary movement, and in a wider context to post-Darwinian worldviews. Thirdly, his constant shifting towards allegorizing and the absurd sug gests that Mirbeau, despite his obvious limitations in range, looks ahead of some of his better known contemporaries towards a more avant-gardist, expressionist sort of writing that permits him to escape the shackles of nineteenth-century realism and anticipate the innova tions of say Kafka or Ionesco. In the first instance, however, we should return to the hedgehog and give it a closer inspection. After all, any literary author demands to be measured by the concrete effect of his words on the page. The narrator of Les 21 Jours d'un neurasthénique has ended up in a town in the Pyrenees where he is supposedly taking a cure. He tells us he is called Georges Vasseur. His friend Dr Triceps, a scientist of some repute, now works in the local lunatic asylum. The hedgehog episode, however, takes place earlier (in 1899) and in another location, two years after Triceps' discovery that "la pauvreté était une névrose" and that incest is the means to regenerate the race (61). What are we to make of this narrator who discovers the hibernating insectivore as he stands on the threshold of the twentieth century? His preliminary rhetorical ques tions ("Dieu sait pourquoi?," "quoi?," "est-ce ainsi qu'il faut dire?," 61) are themselves pointers to the arbitrariness of his story, or any fiction, and an invitation to observe the proceedings with detached skepticism.</page><page sequence="3">Christopher D. Lloyd 151 Even the narrator will fail to weep for his deceased hedgehog. Mirbeau's use of similes, in particular, is the source of sardonic humor: analogies are made with other species that are inappropriately ap propriate. In other words, the apparent discrepancy between the hedgehog and what it's compared to usually contains a pointed message about human or animal behavior. Thus we are told that the hedgehog is "fort 'débrouillard,'" well able to look out for himself (until inter fered with by man, that is) and find a comfortable niche, unlike the "vulgaires purotins," the destitute rejects from human society who fre quently have walk-on parts in Mirbeau's fiction (62). The narrator shifts as the fancy takes him between veiled mockery of scientific terminology and procedures and an equally mocking claim to zoological technique and knowledge. He wonders whether "morphology" is the correct term, although later uses the word "etiolated" and draws attention to his "oeil exercé d'étiologue" (62) that can diagnose anaemia at a glance. (He spends most of the book anatomizing grotesque specimens of humanity, it should be said.) He is able to awaken the animal "progressivement, au moyen de passes sa vantes" (62), a "tour de passe-passe" that with its accelerated and un specified dexterity suggests a stage magician. Later he asserts boldly that he has empirical proof that hedgehogs purr, challenging natural ists to disbelieve him by emphasizing this discovery in its own brief paragraph. The aroused hedgehog, of course, stretches like a cat. No doubt it is a truism that anyone who writes about animals, at least in a literary medium, is likely to be accused of anthropomorphism. Mirbeau's attribution of human characteristics to his hedgehog is jok ingly obvious (it takes to strong drink "comme un vieux capitaine," 64), but it may be noted that such qualities fit into a rather wider pattern, which essentially contrasts domesticity with a state of nature. The hedgehog, when partly tamed, is like a cat; later on it has become still more civilized, "comme un chien'"(63) and greets its master with a com bination of canine and feline behavior (recognizing him like a dog, turn ings its spikes into "un pelage de chat" that invites caresses, 63). But the call of the wild can still be heard. It defends its food fero ciously, "comme un tigre sur sa proie" (63), and is set loose in the woods to satisfy its nocturnal lusts. All its appetites are awakened, and it no longer resembles the etiolated lettuce to which it was compared when found in its initial vegetative state. Indeed, like the feckless and unfor tunate protagonists of that classic naturalist text L'Assommoir (1877), the hedgehog is brought down by physiological excess and lack of moral restraint—by alcoholism, gluttony and sex. For Mirbeau too, these are the evils of a nature irremediably perverted by the hyper trophic demands of civilization. The hedgehog's prodigious appetite</page><page sequence="4">152 Nineteenth-Century French Studies and uncouth table manners may be a source of fun (it takes to potatoes, grapes, rabbit, milk, coffee and finally the demon drink, greedily de manding a taste of every dish, and collapsing in glutted stupefaction over its plate at the end of the meal), but it pays a puritanical price for its indulgences and ends up as an alcoholic wreck ("Cas rare chez les hérissons," 65). In this sense, the hedgehog is a prototypical naturalist hero: if it is spared the alcoholic Coupeau's famous death dance in L'Assommoir, it finishes more like the actor Ginginet in Huysmans' Marthe (1876), whom we also leave as a corpse being sliced up on the dissecting table for another demonstration of "l'intoxication alcoolique complète" (65). Mirbeau works in a more overtly comic mode, and reverses the habitual image of man reduced to the state of animal (Zola's Gervaise dies like a dog in a kennel-like enclosure). Here, on the contrary, the dubious process of domestication has almost brought the hedgehog to fully human status. A brief note of sentimental lyricism is introduced as the hedgehog's "regard presque humain" offers a despairing glimpse of life's impenetrable mysteries, but the prevailing burlesque tone is re stored when its death rattle is compared, appropriately, to the gur gling noise of an emptying bottle and it expires in rather an orgasmic fashion (a series of violent spasms, after which it becomes "flasque," "comme un chiffon," a contrast to its earlier "virile" drinking habits and nocturnal forays to satisfy "d'étranges préoccupations," 64, 65). Might one not indeed just dismiss this piece as a burlesque fantasy? Perhaps so, but in that case one would also have to dismiss Mirbeau as a writer worth taking seriously, since the story typifies both his comic manner and underlying moral preoccupations. A more pointed and less dismissive question would be to ask whether the fact that Mirbeau por trays a hedgehog, specifically, is significant (could Flaubert's parrot be replaced by Flaubert's budgerigar?). An initial impression might be that this fictional hero, with its omnivorous appetite, dog-like behav ior, and doubtful sexual habits, bears little resemblance to any real hedgehog one might meet. When the editor of an edition of Lamartine's Premières Méditations tells us that "L'Isolement" was inspired by the landscape around Milly and wonders if "un admirateur de Lamartine pourrait tirer profit d'une excursion sur la montagne du Craz,"3 we are likely to regard this sort of urge to find documentary correspondences as pedantically irrelevant. Unlike Zola, besides, Mirbeau never professed to be writing "procès-verbaux" (unmediated reports on reality), and retorted to the journalist Jules Huret's enquiry about the waning popularity of naturalism: "Le naturalisme? Mais je m'en fiche!"4 This riposte is again, however, at least in part a mystifying boutade. Like Zola, Mirbeau was throughout his career preoccupied by</page><page sequence="5">Christopher D. Lloyd 153 "la question sociale," or social questions, and with settling a score with the establishment. His writing for the theatre, seen from the other end of the twentieth century, seems in particular to fall into the easily rec ognizable category of naturalist thesis-drama (the exploitation of workers and orphans, the corruption of big business in Les Mauvais Bergers, Le Foyer, and Les Affaires sont les affaires, for example). In this sense, documentary authenticity was important to him, as it was in much of his journalistic writing. But Mirbeau actually starts to become most interesting when he moves less predictably from document to fic tionalizing, from autobiographical reminiscing to fanciful invention (thus La 628-E8 and Les 21 Jours belong to no obvious literary category). If only to help define these boundaries more clearly, it is useful to check the facts about hedgehogs. Unexpectedly perhaps, the study of a scientific monograph on Erinaceus europaeus adds quite considerably to one's understanding of Mirbeau's text. My main source is the English translation of a book by Konrad Herter.5 Here we learn that the hedge hog is probably the most familiar (wild) mammal in Europe, and appears in countless folk tales, often as a rather tricky character. It has about 16,000 spines, which can be erected or laid flat. When Mirbeau uses the verb "darder" about the hedgehog, it is unclear whether he is erroneously assuming that the animal can launch its spines like mis siles, or simply employing the verb to mean "dresser," to erect a defen sive barrier. Nonetheless, most of his observations about the hedgehog, even those that appear purely fanciful, are actually correct. Hedgehogs are nocturnal, solitary animals, often living under hedges. They can be tamed, trained to respond to sounds, and captive hedgehogs are able to identify the smell of their keeper, or his shoes. Indoor hedgehogs would choose a warm spot for hibernation, such as a radia tor or stove. To arouse a hedgehog from hibernation takes several hours. Awakening causes disturbance of metabolic processes and great hunger. Though classified as insectivores, "Hedgehogs eat practically any liv ing creature that they can catch" (39). Captive hedgehogs prefer fish "whether raw, boiled or kippered" (39); they also eat milk, soaked bread, boiled potatoes, rice, fruit, custard and small amounts of choco late, many hedgehogs gorging themselves on their favorite food (though others are abstemious). Not only that, but according to Herter, "Hedgehogs are great drinkers." Disappointingly, however, he adds "especially of pure water" (40). A detail that escaped Mirbeau and that no doubt would have ap pealed to him is that, for practical reasons, "The penis of the hedgehog is disproportionately long and it can enter the vagina without any dan ger of her spines damaging his underparts" (47). A hedgehog giving birth is described as "purring and squeaking" (48). The belief that</page><page sequence="6">154 Nineteenth-Century French Studies hedgehogs can milk cows (by dangling from their udders) is folkloric, as are accounts of them transporting wind fallen fruit impaled on their spines. This brief summary indicates that Mirbeau himself, despite his comic, hyperbolic manner, still obeys the naturalists' rules of empirical observation and literary verisimilitude and avoids folklore or fable, at least in the case of Les 21 Jours. In the wider context of his writing, this is less apparent. Even here, it is partly a question of how one defines a fable, of the point at which allegorical interpretation takes over from the concrete reality of an observed situation. Flaubert's parrot (in "Un Coeur simple") is, so to speak, polymorphous—both living and stuffed animal, domestic companion and exotic reminder of a loved one lost in foreign parts, and also final symbol of the Holy Ghost. So too, on a less ambitious scale, is the hedgehog—a comic figure, a domesticated insec tivore that is abused by the narrator and Dr. Triceps, but also a typical example of the individual who succumbs to the destructive effect of in stinct perverted by civilization (like the hero of the earlier novel Sébastien Roch (1890), for instance). Kafka's specific debt to Mirbeau's novel Le Jardin des supplices has been noted by several commentators.6 In many ways, it is a lot more in teresting to read Mirbeau, or other texts anterior to Kafka, retrospec tively in the light of Kafka's own enigmatic fables, where animals suf fering from existential anguish often play a leading role. Mirbeau pub lished an allegorical tale called "La Vache tachetée" in 1898 about a man called "Jacques Errant" who has spent a year in solitary confine ment for no reason. Like Kafka's Josef K. he believes naively in justice and therefore in the probability of his own guilt, thinking that "suspendu à la terreur d'un procès dont j'ignore la cause, [il] faut que j'aie commis, sans m'en douter, un bien grand crime' (Contes cruels, 2: 379). Finally he is exposed to the dazzling light of the courtroom (unlike Kafka's petitioner in the section of The Trial sometimes called "Before the Law," who waits in vain to be exposed to this radiance) and is sen tenced to "cinquante années de bagne" for the offence of owning a spotted cow. Mirbeau's specific target in this parable was evidently the Dreyfus Affair (the spotted cow as an arbitrary sign of infamy is equiv alent to being a Jewish officer), although the obsessive and fruitless ra tiocination of Kafka's submissive characters that is anticipated in this tale makes us think that a more compelling moral is that life is a "cauchemar, [...] pareille à un conte d'Edgar Poë réalisé"; "Et la plus grande folie est de chercher une raison aux choses," a message delivered by Mirbeau himself in a story of 1890 whose title consists simply of a question mark (Contes cruels, 1: 156,157).</page><page sequence="7">Christopher D. Lloyd 155 To return, for the last time, to hedgehogs, before looking at Mirbeau's treatment of other animals, it is interesting to discover in Grimm's Fairy Tales7 two stories that contain premonitory echoes of both Kafka and Mirbeau. In the fascinating and delightful "Hans the Hedgehog," Hans starts life with some of the disadvantages of Gregor Samsa in "The Metamorphosis." Desperate for an heir, his father rashly says he would be happy to beget a hedgehog. But when Hans is duly born half boy, half hedgehog, he is left to lie "behind the stove for eight years, and his father was tired of him and thought: 'If he would but die!'" (498), a situation that encapsulates the anti-Oedipal scenario of Kafka's story of the son-insect destroyed by a rejuvenated father. However, Hans has more spunk than the enfeebled protagonists of fin-de-siècle literature and rides off to the forest on a cock, where he plays the bagpipes and becomes a successful swineherd. Finally he marries the second king's daughter and becomes a normal man (the first king's daughter pays for her father's broken promise by being stripped and pierced by his spikes, after which she is "disgraced for the rest of her life," 501). It is worth noting, given the reflections on the status of the negro on the evolutionary and socio-political scale in the works of Mirbeau and his contemporaries (a general in Les 21 Jours uses their hides for wallpaper), that Hans passes through a transitional stage as a black in his transformation from hedgehog to man. The second story, "The Hare and the Hedgehog," is a reworking of the more familiar fable about the contest between the hare and the tor toise. Here the hedgehog shares the taste of Mirbeau's protagonists, since he bets the hare "A golden louis-d'or and a bottle of brandy" (761) that he will be the victor. The hedgehog does in fact win the race by judicious cheating (his wife doubles up for him on the finishing line), and the hare drops dead from exhaustion. Mirbeau's comment in a later chapter of Les 21 Jours that the hedgehog reveals an "étonnante rou blardise" and a "merveilleuse ingéniosité [...] dans la lutte pour la vie" (136) points very aptly to the moral of this tale. At this point, the nar rator of Les 21 Jours is about to reveal another important scientific dis covery that he has recently made (previous discoveries included "l'ambulation chez les végétaux" and "l'autocriminologie de l'araignée" (136) and aroused furious resentment in the scientific com munity). This turns out to be a prolonged combat between a hedgehog and a viper, which the hedgehog wins. (In fact, such deadly encounters have been attested by naturalists.) Readers of Mirbeau will of course recall that the voracious hedge hogs of Les 21 Jours have a companion in his previous and better known novel Le Journal d'une femme de chambre (1900). Célestine's neighbor is the omnivorous Captain Mauger, who is described as having "une tête</page><page sequence="8">156 Nineteenth-Century French Studies de carpe" (105). His method of dealing with an unfamiliar creature is to eat it (flowers, insects, worms and snakes all contribute to his diet). He has a pet ferret called Kléber. When Célestine makes the "diabolic" suggestion that he eat Kléber, principle forces him to agree and he kills him on the spot ("Tu m'en feras une gibelotte, ce soir!" 109). A week later, Célestine discovers Mauger taming a hedgehog he calls Bourbaki (like Kléber, a famous general, who died a few years before the book was published). Like its master, this creature is also om nivorous; and like its successor in Les 21 Jours it too dies "d'une conges tion pulmonaire, pour avoir bu trop de cognac" (225) (as does Captain Mauger's servant-mistress Rose). Following the practice of Maupassant, Mirbeau was notorious for re-using the same material in different places. Jean-François Nivet has shown in tabular form the sources of the forty-six stories that make up Les 21 Jours. The hedgehog episodes derive from newspaper stories published in Le Journal in March and April 1896, entitled "Un peu de science" and "Lettre ouverte à Alphonse Allais."8 The ferret first appears in "Puvisse Déchavane" in L'Echo de Paris, 23 May 1893 (Contes cruels 1: 393f.). The reference to Allais and the fragmentary composition of Mirbeau's later books both merit further comment. But to remain with the subject of his fauna, before opening the discussion on to such wider issues, it is interesting to compare the bestiary of the novel Le Journal d'une femme de chambre with Buñuel's film inspired bv Mirbeau's text. With their penchant for black humor, narrative disrupted by surreal anecdotes, Roman Catholic priests, unconventional sex, and small ani mals, Mirbeau and Bunuel may seem to have been made for each other. Certainly, Buñuel's version is far more successful than Renoir's sani tized Hollywood adaptation, where most of the bizarreries and nasti ness of the characters are sacrificed to a conventional moral ending (the wicked Joseph gets his just desserts). Some modifications to events in the book in the Buñuel film seem justified or at least insignificant. Thus the character M. Rabour is not only a boot fetishist, but also likes to shoot butterflies. The ducks that Joseph tortures in the book become geese in the film. There is a close-up of swarming ants, presumably be cause this is the director's trademark. In the novel, there is an explicit description of the corpse of the murdered child Claire, whose wander ing in the woods is left unmotivated. In the film, she is said to be col lecting snails. A shot of three snails crawling over her splayed legs brought objections from the censor, although Marcel Martin claims that this image is "d'une tendresse, d'une pitié infinies."9 As it happens, Buñuel's fixation on snails and ants is shared by Mirbeau, even if they are neglected in Le Journal d'une femme de cham bre. Chapter twenty of Les 21 Jours contains a macabre story about a cul</page><page sequence="9">Christopher D. Lloyd 157 tivator of sea snails, who discovers that his mollusks thrive best when fed on human flesh. Predictably perhaps, in his obsession "il devint farouche, ainsi qu'une bête" (300) and ends up as a victim of his own snails: man becomes beast, and beast eats man, as nature reverses the normal pattern of culture.10 The disenchanted hero of Sébastien Roch (1890) spends his days watching an ants' nest, perceiving in this "une énorme histoire sociale qu'il serait autrement intéressant d'apprendre que les luttes de la République athénienne" (278). Natural history su persedes man-centered political history (recalling Flaubert's dictum that "l'histoire d'un pou peut être plus belle que celle d'Alexandre").11 It is at this point that Mirbeau and Buftuel diverge. In the novel, the servant Célestine is morally repelled but sexually enthralled by the monstrous Joseph, who is a violent anti-Semite and probable child murderer. Eventually she helps him despoil their employers and they set up a café in Cherbourg where they proceed to exploit their own ser vants. There can be little doubt that Buftuel betrayed the overriding sense of sadomasochistic complicity that infuses the novel by effec tively purifying the heroine (played by a tight-lipped Jeanne Moreau) and changing her relationship with the other characters. In the film, Célestine actually plants a shoe nail belonging to Joseph at the scene of the murder, in an unsuccessful attempt to incriminate him. He escapes justice, however, and establishes the café with another woman of obvi ously dubious virtue. Now Célestine achieves her own promotion to the ranks of the petite bourgeoisie by marrying Captain Mauger. Although he throws out his servant Rose to replace her with Célestine, he too is made into a more palatable character: his omnivorous eating habits are suppressed, and he becomes a bohemian eccentric who enjoys baiting the stiff-necked neighbors for whom Célestine works. Mauger in the novel is a "grotesque et sinistre fantoche" (282), and Célestine turns down his proposal in favor of Joseph. In the film, grotesque or evil characteristics are rather schematically transferred to easily identifiable political or class enemies (such as the fascistic Joseph and his friend the sacristan, or sexually perverse members of the bourgeoisie like Rabour and Monteil). As Marcel Martin remarks, "Tout cela n'a rien à voir avec une psychologie tératologique"; on the contrary, "c'est une vision sociale."12 The slaughter of innocents is observed without sadism, whether they are the child, the butterflies or the geese. Martin's observations seem intended to vindicate Buñuel from charges of pornographic voyeurism and give him an ideological clean bill of health. Unwittingly, he emphasizes the differences between Buftuel and his source. In Les 21 Jours, Mirbeau's narrator tells us he de lights in the mad, the bad and the monstrous. His writing comes to life when he alights upon a "dernier spécimen d'humanité téra</page><page sequence="10">158 Nineteenth-Century French Studies tologique'"(81) and is able to entrap it with a caricatural verve that at its best achieves a manic, fantastical inventiveness. Visiting the lu natic asylum where Dr Triceps is employed, the narrator remarks: "Le regard des fous m'effraie par la possibilité d'une contagion" (66). He meets an inmate who has had his name stolen and thinks he's a charac ter in Balzac; a tailor made off with his thought, which resembled a butterfly. In the outside world, we are shown a marquise followed more predictably by "tous les échantillons de l'animalité humaine" (117). Mirbeau's bestiary reminds us of his overwhelming obsession with the Sadeian immorality of nature, an obsession that throws up (or rather constantly regurgitates) two paradoxes. One is the uneasy dualism that sets nature against culture, staking an imperialistic claim for the uniqueness of the human species while simultaneously accepting scien tific theories that place man within a nature governed by evolutionary forces. The other is more particular to Mirbeau: he plays the role of the libertarian anarchist who abhors cruelty and oppression with some conviction, yet his books endlessly recycle tales of horror with joyful gusto, so that he appears as much to celebrate as to condemn man or na ture's skill in inventing atrocities. General Archinard, who appears in a mock interview (a genre that Mirbeau frequently uses in his journalism to deride the hypocrisies and pretensions of contemporary figures) in chapter nine of Les 21 Jours fa vors the recycling of negroes' hides as wallpaper, as has already been mentioned. Is this Swiftian satire of colonialist atrocities, or something rather more equivocal? "Je ne connais qu'un moyen de civiliser les gens, c'est de les tuer," he remarks (115). Civilization accelerates the normal processes of nature so that the terminus of civilized or natural life, death, is reached with an absurd rapidity. The useless molecules, "la matière inerte," of the blacks, are reassembled into something more economically or aesthetically useful; the same could be done with white criminals ("Du cuir de criminel, [...] il n'y a pas au-dessus," 116), but the General rejects the suggestion of dyeing them black to appease public opinion in France. Is the message of these grisly stories, whether they are about hedgehogs or blacks ("presque des bêtes," 115), that culture perverts na ture's laws, or rather that it takes them to an extreme but logical con clusion? Clara, the "fée des charniers" of Le Jardin des supplices (1899), defines monsters as superior beings who exist "au-dessus des mensonges sociaux, dans la resplendissante et divine immoralité des choses" (225). Are the inhibitions of social morality then no more than ideological lies meant to hide from the individual the reality of what Mirbeau calls throughout his work "la loi éternelle du Meurtre" (L'Abbé Jules, 146)? Society, it would seem, is a monstrous carbuncle on the face of na</page><page sequence="11">Christopher D. Lloyd 159 ture that hastens nature's destructive work while simultaneously thwarting the individual's chances of short-term fulfillment. Mirbeau's parables constantly retell the same story and suggest a mix ture of moral revulsion and nihilistic delight at this discovery. In La 628-E8 he reminds us with stridently naturalistic scatological rhetoric that human love and genius are bound to the imperatives of a con stantly degenerating physical organism. "Constipé, le divin Platon de vient aussitôt une brute quinteuse et stupide. L'intestin commande au cerveau ..." (262). This message is displeasing, less perhaps because it suggests an ab surdist pessimism than because it often seems tritely reductive and also curiously at odds with Mirbeau's own social campaigning, motivated presumably by a more positive ethic. In the chapter called "La Faune des routes" in La 628-E8, he presents a series of pseudo-fables stemming from observation of various animals and their similarities with mankind. If donkeys are men in their independence and courage, men are all too often merely horses, timorous and servile imbeciles. Travelling through the Netherlands, the narrator and his chauffeur attempt to find the residence of Descartes. Needless to say, the unlettered inhabi tants have never heard of the famous philosopher, and direct them to the lunatic asylum, a hotel, the cemetery or a house that displays Spinoza's slippers and lenses. This leads the narrator to recall Descartes's radical separation of men from beasts, and La Fontaine's re fusal to accept a purely mechanistic conception of animals. But the nar rator wonders: Qui fut pour elles plus sévère? Le savant qui leur refusait rigoureusement l'intelligence, même la sensibilité, ou le plus charmant de nos poètes, que leur spectacle émerveilla, mais qui ne leur fit parler que la langue de nos vices et de notre sottise?(290) Mirbeau's most extended exploration of animal characters is his last completed novel, Dingo. This is a much more overtly allegorical piece of work than the rather more anecdotal fragments that have been dis cussed so far. As a result, his complaint about La Fontaine's anthropo morphism might easily be turned against his own text. This is not neces sarily a criticism: animals in fables and fairy stories by definition speak the language of human vices and virtues. The question is rather whether they say interesting things. Marcel Aymé notes that a critic of his charming book, Les Contes du chat perché, observed with obtuse sagacity that if animals could talk, they certainly wouldn't talk like the animals in Aymé's stories. Anthropomorphism, besides, is not all that easy to define. When Aymé's heroines Delphine and Marinette</page><page sequence="12">160 Nineteenth-Century French Studies reproach the wolf for eating lamb, he retorts that they eat lamb all the time.13 Carnivores are still carnivores, even if some of them use knives and forks. Not only do men and animals share certain behavioral traits, but also perhaps certain moral characteristics. Konrad Lorenz notes that "domestic dogs have been selected by man for properties which in hu man society are regarded as virtues." The dog fulfils the Christian command to love one's neighbor as oneself, or at least one's master, rather better than most men, and shows a behavioral awareness of guilt that might be called bad conscience. Lorenz's pet dingo, however, lacked this sort of inhibition. He asserts that the dingo "is a domestic dog gone feral," although in fact there is no concrete evidence for this.14 The origins of the dingo (how it got to Australia, whether it was a true wild dog or partly domesticated) remain obscure; it can enjoy a limited symbiosis with man, although it cannot be fully tamed. Mirbeau had two dogs he successively called Dingo. Whether they were really Australian dingoes is unclear and perhaps less important than the fact that the hero of the novel is certainly a wild canid who finds himself living in Western civilization and a vehicle for his cre ator's by now habitual reflections on its limitations. If man is an uncer tain hybrid, neither ape nor angel, so too is Dingo, who is "ni chien, ni loup" (20), suspended between domesticity and the wild. In this sense, it may seem that to accuse Mirbeau of anthropomorphism (the attribu tion of human qualities to superior or inferior beings) is doubly inappro priate, if we are meant to accept a truly evolutionary conception of both man and beast: human nature is not radically separate from other species; all are subject to the same materialist determinisms. In fact, Mirbeau introduces evolutionary theories from the beginning of the novel, but the intention is obviously to parody the pretensions and arbi trariness of scientific taxonomies: "Rien n'est immuable. Tel qui était poisson jadis est devenu oiseau; tel qui fut singe est aujourd'hui pape, roi, ministre, général ou philosophe" (19).13 Similarly, the causal chain is stretched to absurdly reductive lengths: "Herbert Spencer, en juillet 1873, découvrit dans la danse du scalp des Fijiens l'origine de la musique, du drame, et même de la biographie" (23). At the same time, however, Dingo is the free spirit untrammeled by the discontents and inhibitions of civilization. He is a natural enemy of the brutish peasantry and their domesticated livestock, but also of lawyers and soldiers, since he is endowed with an anarchist's disdain for property and the established hierarchy. Nonetheless, he is undy ingly loyal to the narrator, although he himself appears as a member of the ruling, possessing classes with a sentimental attachment to the underdog. Mirbeau's contemporary Jack London has been accused of an</page><page sequence="13">Christopher D. Lloyd 161 thropomorphizing animals to an absurd extent in the famous dog stories like The Call of the Wild that were published in the decade before Dingo (1913). If London is saved by the "presentational immediacy" of his fiction, which makes him "an artist of violent action,"16 Mirbeau falters partly because he is unable to give Dingo a convincing canine personality, even an anthropomorphized one. As he says in chapter eleven, "Dingo n'était ni un chien ni un homme" (217-18). Instead he tends to become a pretext that justifies a succession of anecdotal or alle gorical episodes mainly based on his escapades. The fragmentary composition of Mirbeau's later books has always struck his critics. His recent biographers Michel and Nivet point out that he was physically unable to complete Dingo and passed the task on to Léon Werth, who wrote the last three chapters (including the eleventh chapter set in Paris, just quoted, which is one of the most lively).17 Whether Léon Werth had a free hand in this exercise or not remains unclear. In his declining years, Mirbeau was surrounded by a quarrelsome entourage that engaged in mutual recriminations about the master's wishes. The novel Un gentilhomme was never finished and the jingoistic "Testament politique" published on his death in 1917 is often said to be a forgery concocted by his wife and her associates. A conventional (and perhaps justifiable) response to the hybrid works that Mirbeau published in the early years of the twentieth cen tury is simply to reject them as of little lasting interest. Thus Reg Carr finds what he calls the three novels Le Journal d'une femme de cham bre, Les 21 Jours and La 628-E8 to be "inferior in literary quality to most of his previous work."18 Personally, I find them superior to the more conventional early novels, precisely because of their diversity, perver sity and unconventional blending of fact and fiction. Julian Barnes's well-received novel Flaubert's Parrot (1984) cleverly blends fictional biography, literary scholarship and academic spoof around that cen tral, proliferating psittacine figure. The fictional hero Braithwaite is used to deflate critical pomposities and to settle the hash of a real-life monstre sacré like Enid Starkie. Mirbeau does the same thing to Paul Bourget in Le Journal d'une femme de chambre.™ Mirbeau's humor is no respecter of persons, animals or literary conventions. It is often offen sive and distasteful, but also provocative and inventive, the glue that holds together the loose-fitting framework of his disrupted narratives. In his recent Anthologie de l'humour noir 1900, Jean-Claude Carrière observes: "De 1880 à 1910, la France a connu la plus grande épidémie de rire de son histoire." Mirbeau clearly helped spread this epidemic, although curiously his work does not feature in this book (even though Carrière wrote the script for Le Journal d'une femme de chambre). Carrière also wisely notes: "C'est une entreprise des plus saugrenues que</page><page sequence="14">162 Nineteenth-Century French Studies d'essayer de définir l'humour." Definitions of humor are certainly no laughing matter, but Carrière comments suggestively that the sort of black humor that fascinated Mirbeau and his contemporaries "consiste à rire de la mort."20 A concluding example of Mirbeau's black humor might be his one-act play, appropriately entitled L'Epidémie and per formed at the Théâtre Antoine in 1898. The ubiquitous Dr. Triceps, who diagnosed neurosis as the universal cause of all ills in Les 21 Jours, also appears in this rather grating com edy, the plot of which is loosely derived from Ibsen's An Enemy of the People, since it is about a town council's deliberations on how to contain a typhoid epidemic that threatens its prosperity. The satire is pre dictable: the representatives of the people remain unperturbed while the victims are only soldiers in the local barracks. But the death of a bourgeois, a superior species, "vénérable, gras, rose, heureux," is more disturbing. "Son ventre faisait envie aux pauvres" (18); death should respect the social hierarchy. More interesting than the grotesquely ego tistical characters are the occasional absurdities and automatisms of gesture and language that push the play in the direction of Ionesco. But Mirbeau remains a naturalist, here as elsewhere. Zola offered a defini tion of naturalism as "le retour à la nature, l'esprit scientifique porté dans toutes nos connaissances."21 Mirbeau's skepticism about the limita tions of the scientific spirit is exemplified by a character like Triceps, whose deterministic fatalism is simply a hypocritical guise for leaving the iniquities of the social order undisturbed. In Dingo a triple-chinned, porcine vet appears who asserts that rabies is a disease invented by the Pasteur Institute to keep it in business (chapter eleven). Science or its practitioners can cast darkness as well as light, perpetuate rather than dispel mystification. Mirbeau shares the disillusioned pessimism of those late nineteenth-century writers who found man's reinsertion in nature to be a mixture of comedy and catastrophe. David Baguley de fines naturalism in a telling phrase as "the genre of the human genre, a body of literature that views man generically, as a (threatened) species."22 He quotes the Goncourt brothers' caustic definition of human reproduction: "L'homme pisse l'enfant et la femme le chie."23 In Mirbeau's novel Sébastien Roch (1890), the eternal monotony and degrading inevitability of the biological cycle are conveyed in a less excremental but equally typical phrase: "c'était l'époque où les couples amoureux et enlacés promenaient leurs ruts dans les champs" (340). Elsewhere, we find similar images typical of the lugubrious zoological vision of naturalist authors: a hideous prostitute compared to a toad, a weak-willed protagonist to a "silencieux insecte," France itself to an "immense faisanderie," which is despoiled by greedy predators.24</page><page sequence="15">Christopher D. Lloyd 163 Fortunately, Mirbeau's vision of the natural world is not limited to such dispiriting and familiar metaphors. He wrote a story about his passion for flowers called "Le Concombre fugitif," where he remarks: "Les fleurs me sont des amies 'silencieuses et violentes,' et fidèles. [...] Mais je n'aime pas les fleurs bêtes."25 The fleeing cucumber, a sort of vegetable Albertine, makes a brief flashing appearance in the last sen tence of the story, but returns explosively, spitting its seeds at would-be captors in a sequel, called "Explosif et baladeur"; this story is dedi cated to Alphonse Allais and turns into an encomium of his comic talent. The peripatetic cucumber is obviously better equipped for survival than the alcoholic hedgehog; so too is a literary manner that sees the ad vantages of disrupting the earthbound subject matter and conventions of naturalist writing. In a famous essay on Tolstoy's conception of history, Isaiah Berlin quotes an ancient Greek proverb that says: "The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing."26 Whatever the value of his distinction between supposedly centripetal and centrifugal writers, we might well accept that Mirbeau did not know many tricks. For all that he was married to Alice Regnault, the widow of a certain Jules Renard and reputedly a foxy lady, Mirbeau was no doubt a hedgehog. In some versions of the fabled race, the contest is between fox and hedgehog, for they are the two most cunning animals. Once again, it is the hedgehog who wins. Mirbeau may well have been a prickly customer, with a fairly short-sighted vision and range; but his barbs retain their sharp ness and help guarantee his survival. University of Durham School of Modem European Languages Elvet Riverside, New Elvet DH1 3JT, England APPENDIX Un jour que j'étais descendu à la cave,—Dieu sait pourquoi, par exem ple?—je trouvai, au fond d'une vieille boîte d'épicerie, sous une couche épaisse de petit foin, dit d'emballage, je trouvai... quoi? ... un hérisson. Roulé en boule, il dormait de ce profond, de cet effrayant sommeil hivernal, dont les sa vants ne nous ont point encore expliqué la morphologie—est-ce ainsi qu'il faut dire? La présence, dans une boîte d'épicerie, de cet animal, ne m'étonna pas autrement. Le hérisson est un quadrupède calculateur et fort "débrouillard." Au lieu de chercher, pour l'hiver, un peu confortable abri sous un dangereux et aléatoire tas de feuilles ou dans le trou d'un vieil arbre mort, celui-ci avait jugé</page><page sequence="16">164 Nineteenth-Century French Studies qu'il serait plus au chaud et plus tranquille dans une cave. Notez, en outre, que, par un raffinement de confortable, il avait choisi, pour l'hivernage, cette boîte d'épicerie, parce qu'elle était placée contre le mur, à un endroit précis où passe le tuyau du calorifère. Je reconnus bien là un des trucs familiers aux hérissons, qui ne sont pas assez stupides pour se laisser mourir de froid, comme de vul gaires purotins. L'animal, réveillé par moi progressivement au moyen de passes savantes, ne parut pas non plus s'étonner outre mesure de la présence, dans la cave, d'un homme qui l'examinait indiscrètement, penché sur sa boîte. Il se déroula lentement, s'allongea peu à peu, avec des mouvements prudents, se dressa sur ses pattes basses, et s'étira comme fait un chat, en grattant le sol de ses ongles. Chose extraordinaire: quand je le soulevai et le pris dans ma main, non seule ment il ne se roula pas en boule, mais il ne darda pas un seul de ses piquants et ne fronça point les plis barbelés de son petit crâne. Au contraire, à la façon dont il groïnait et faisait claquer sa mâchoire, à la façon aussi dont son nez far fouilleur frémissait, je vis qu'il exprimait de la joie, de la confiance et... de l'appétit. Pauvre petit diable! Il était pâle et, pour ainsi dire, étiolé, à la manière des salades qui sont restées longtemps dans un lieu obscur. Ses yeux, très noirs, brillaient de l'étrange éclat qu'ont les yeux des chlorotiques, et ses paupières humides, légèrement suintantes, révélaient à mon oeil exercé d'étiologue une anémie avancée. Je le montai dans la cuisine, et, tout de suite, il nous stupéfia par sa familiarité et ses aises d'être chez soi. Il reniflait comme un affamé vers les fricots qui mijotaient doucement sur le feu, et ses narines humaient, avec d'impératives délices, les odeurs de sauces qui passaient. Je lui offris d'abord du lait, et il le but avidement. Ensuite, je lui présentai un morceau de viande, sur laquelle, dès qu'il l'eut flairé, il se précipita vorace ment, comme un tigre sur sa proie. Les deux pattes de devant croisées sur la viande, en signe de possession définitive, il la déchiqueta, de coin, en grognant, et son petit oeil noir s'allumait de lueurs féroces. De menues lanières rouges pendaient à sa mâchoire, et son groin se barbouillait de sauce. En quelques secondes, la viande fut engloutie. Une pomme de terre eut le même sort; une grappe de raisin disparut aussitôt qu'offerte. Il avala une tasse de café, à grandes gorgées retentissantes ... Après quoi, repu, il se laissa tomber dans son assiette, et s'endormit. Le lendemain, le hérisson était apprivoisé comme un chien. Dès que j'entrais dans la pièce où je lui avais fait une litière bien chaude, il marquait une joie excessive, venait à moi, et n'était heureux que lorsque je l'avais pris. Alors, caressant, ses piquants si bien couchés sur son dos qu'ils étaient doux ainsi qu'un pelage de chat, il poussait de petits cris sourds qui devinrent, en peu de temps, continus, monotones et endormeurs comme un ronronnement. Oui, il faut que les naturalistes le sachent, ce hérisson ronronnait. Comme il m'amusait beaucoup et que je commençais à l'aimer, je l'avais admis à l'honneur de ma table. On lui mettait une assiette à côté de la mienne, et il mangeait de tout, exprimant par de comiques colères son mécontement, quand il voyait emporter un plat dont il n'avait rien goûté. Jamais je n'ai connu</page><page sequence="17">Christopher D. Lloyd 165 une personne aussi facile à nourrir. Viande, légumes, conserves, entremets, fruits, il n'était pas un mets qu'il refusât de manger. Mais il avait une préférence pour le lapin. Il le humait de loin. Ces jours-là, il devenait fou; et on ne pouvait le rassasier. Il eut trois indigestions de lapin dont il faillit mourir, la pauvre bête, et auxquelles je dus opposer des remèdes énergiques et de solides purgations. Le malheur voulut que, par faiblesse, par perversité, peut-être, je l'accoutumasse aux boissons alcooliques. Quand il y eut goûté, il se refusa, avec un entêtement colérique, à en boire d'autres. Chaque jour, il avalait son verre de fine champagne, comme un homme. Il n'en éprouvait aucune gêne, aucun trouble, aucune ivresse. Buveur solide, il "portait la boisson," comme un vieux capitaine. Il prit aussi l'habitude de l'absinthe, et parut s'en trouver bien. Son pelage avait foncé, ses yeux ne pleuraient plus, toute trace d'anémie avait disparu. Et, quelque fois, je surprenais dans son regard, d'étranges préoccupa tions, et comme des lueurs de luxure. Certain qu'il rentrerait à son gite, par les belles nuits chaudes je le lâchais dans le bois, à l'aventure, et le matin, dès l'aube, il était là, près de la porte, attendant qu'on lui ouvrit. Presque tout le jour, il dormait d'un sommeil de plomb, réparant ainsi ses débauches nocturnes. Un matin, je le trouvai étendu sur sa litière. Il ne se leva pas à mon ap proche. Je l'appelai. Il ne bougea pas. Je le pris dans ma main; il était froid. Pourtant, il respirait encore ... Oh! son petit oeil, et le regard qu'il me lança, qu'il eut encore la force de me lancer, jamais je ne l'oublierai... ce regard presque humain, où il y avait de l'étonnement, de la tristesse, et tant de choses mystérieuses et profondes que j'aurais voulu comprendre ... Il respirait en core .. . Une sorte de petit râle, pareil au glouglou d'une bouteille qui se vide ... puis deux secousses, un spasme, un cri, encore un spasme... Il était mort. Je faillis pleurer... Je le considérai bêtement dans ma main. Il ne portait aucune trace de vio lence sur son corps, flasque, maintenant, comme un chiffon; aucun symptôme apparent de maladie ne se révélait. La veille, il n'était point sorti dans le bois, et, le soir, il avait bu joyeusement son verre de fine champagne. De quoi donc était-il mort? Pouquoi cette soudaineté? J'envoyai le cadavre à Triceps qui l'auto-psia. Et voici le petit mot bref que, trois jours après, je reçus: Cher ami, Intoxication alcoolique complète. Est mort de la pneumonie des buveurs. Cas rare chez les hérissons. A toi. ALEXIS TRICEPS.
