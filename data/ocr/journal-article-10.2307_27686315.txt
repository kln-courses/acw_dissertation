<plain_text><page sequence="1">Heinz Happ: Hyle. Studien zum Aristotelischen Materie-Begriff. Berlin: De Gruyter 1971. XV, 953 S. This is an intelligent, instructive, and stimulating book. Although the present reviewer believes that Happ's definition of his topic is fundamen tally misconceived and that his principal conclusion is mistaken, there is no doubt that the careful exposition, the extremely thorough and judicious gathering of material and sifting of earlier views, together with a critical reflection on the problems of interpretation involved, will make this a very valuable book for anyone working on Aristotle's conceptual scheme or, more generally, on Greek philosophy of nature. In the first place H. gives a masterful summary of the modern scholarly tradition insofar as it concerns Aristotle's concept of matter, and concerning his metaphysics as a whole. In the second place he offers a new view of the problem situation within which Aristotle set to work, a view based upon the reconstruction by Kr?mer and Gaiser of the cunwritten doctrines&gt; of Plato and the early Academy. In this controversial area (and elsewhere also) H. has largely succeeded in his aim of permitting that ?auch Forscher, die</page><page sequence="2">646 Ch. H. Kahn: Happ, Hyle ganz anderer Meinung als der Verfasser sind, sich aus dem vorgelegten Quellenbefund ein eigenes Bild der Sachlage machen k?nnen? (VII). H. denies the existence of a T?bingen school cpledged to the common dogma of the esoteric Plato'. The opinions advanced are based on evidence rather than authority. They are based, of course, upon a certain view of the evidence. But it is one of this book's merits to remind us that the evidence is always seen from some point of view, that no inquiry can be carried on without presuppositions, since the facts (or the texts) never speak for themselves. This methodical reflection on the interaction between our own philosophical assump tions and our interpretation of ancient philosophy begins in the very first pages of the book, with a review of the nineteenth century literature. Hertling and Baeumker, and many others since, criticize Aristotle's conception of matter on the grounds that it reflects an anthropomorphic view of nature as acting like a human craftsman. H. responds by taking up Aristotle's own point of view, which regards art and nature as two expressions of a single rational structure. What is at issue in this modern criticism is nothing less than Cartesian dualism with its mechanistic view of nature, a dualism which implies that art and nature must be contrasted as mind versus matter, intelligent human enterprise versus blind and lifeless necessity. For Aristotle, on the other hand, the basic structure of nature and the structure of the human mind or vou? is one and the same. Only if one takes for granted the modern dichotomy in its radical form can one reasonally speak of Aristotle transferring1 or projecting' the concepts of art onto nature as onto an alien domain. This oversized book consists of eight chapters, four of which have the scope and dimensions of independent monographs. These are: 2. Matter in the Early Academy (196 pp.); 4- tcXtj&amp;o? as Principle of Matter in Metaphysics T/K (163 pp.); 7- Matter and Knowledge: Aristotle's Doctrine of Abstraction (119 pp.); an&lt;3 tne concluding chapter 8, 'Die Hyle als Seinsprinzip5 (130 pp.). What follows is a skeletal outline of the contents and the principal opinions defended, together with some indication of what seems most problematic in H.'s treatment. The first chapter contains the survey of previous literature on the topic and defines cthe standpoint of the present work5. The historical approach is that of a revisionist Jaegerian. H. follows Jaeger, and some of his own colleagues at T?bingen, in seeing a close doctrinal connection between Aristotle's philosophy and that of Plato in his later or even his middle period. At times he suggests that (outside of the philosophy of mathe matics) there may be no difference of principle at all between Aristotle and Plato rightly understood (e. g. p. 53 : ?da? . . . Aristoteles trotz seiner Platon-Kritik . . . sachlich genau dasselbe wie Piaton meint, n?mlich die objektive* Vorgegebenheit des idealen Seins?). In particular, both philoso phers are dualists of much the same sort, with the Indefinite Dyad playing the role of matter for Plato. On the other hand, like most scholars of the younger generation H. has abandoned the Jaegerian game of reconstruct ing Aristotle's 'development5. He rightly recognizes that attempts to separate out chronological strata within the extant works are generally arbitrary and unconvincing, and that there is no evidence for radical change in Aristotle's outlook of the sort that Jaeger imagined, e. g. no change from Platonist to empiricist (56-58). This introductory chapter also formulates the central thesis of the book: that we must</page><page sequence="3">Ch. H. Kahn: Happ, Hyle 647 sharply distinguish between Matter as a first principle (apx*), Seinsprinzip) and cthe manifestations of this principle which are found in particular levels of being5 (Seinsschichten) (17). It is this ultimate principle of cpure matter5 that serves as root or ground for all the varieties of matter including the prime matter of the elements ; and it is this principle, together with its counterpart the principle of cpure form5, that constitutes the dynamic dualism of Aristotle's system (26). The author is particularly concerned to clarify the philosophical status of Aristotelian vovjT? (including the principle of Matter) by steering between the treacherous reefs of Realism and extreme Idealism in order to guarantee ?den von Piaton herkommenden Geistcharakter des aristotelischen Philosophierens? (51). H.'s philosophie point of view is defined by reference to neo-Kantianism and its various neo-Hegelian or neo Scholastic alternatives; he shows little familiarity with Husserl and none with Frege, Russell, Wittgenstein and what would from the English-speaking point of view be described as the mainstream of twentieth-century philosophy. The result is a somewhat old-fashioned view of what constitutes a philosophical system. But the statement of this view is extremely clear, and thus the reader can easily discount it if he so chooses. The second chapter, on matter in the early Academy, rests heavily upon the reconstruction of the De Bono and Plato's unwritten doctrines, and this raises too many problems for discussion here. H. reads the evi dence from Theophrastus Met. 6a24~bi as showing that Plato derived the Place-Receptacle of the Timaeus from the 'second principle5 of the De Bono (11 if), and in general he denies that the dialogues tell us anything about Plato's concept of matter that we could not have dis covered from the treatise On the Good (94). The chapter is the longest in the book, and with good reason: the reconstructed Platonic system of two principles serves as a guide, and also as a confirmation, for the interpretation of Aristotle's own system.1 The detailed interpretation of Aristotle begins in chapter 3 with the doctrine of matter as substrate (uTcoxeifxsvov) of opposites. This chapter is, surprisingly, the shortest in the book (32 pp.), and it contains no analysis of the concept of utuox?L[jL?vov as such, for example in the Categories5 where the term uAy) never appears but where ?toxs?jjisvov provides the basic reference point for Aristotle's theory of predication. H.'s rendering of ?ttox??u.?Vov as 'Substrat' reflects a deliberate decision to avoid the literal translation 'Subjekt' as misleading (279 n. 5), but it has the unfortunate effect of denying any essential connection between ?tuoxsiu.svov as matter in Physics A and U7rox??u.?vov as subject of attributes in the Categories. This makes it difficult to understand why Aristotle should say in Met. Z 3 that if ouaioc is understood as i)7rox??[X?vov for categorial determination it ends by being identified with matter. In another context H. discusses this passage from Met. Z 3 in detail and cites important and generally neglected parallels which show that Aristotle repeatedly refers to ulr? as the ultimate subject of predication (666). It is characteristic that H. should treat this evidence only in connection with Aristotle's theory of knowledge and not relate it 1 As a guide: it is ?a priori sicher, da? Aristoteles seine Hyle aus dem zweiten Prinzip der Akademie herausentwickelt hat? (260). As a confirmation: ?Ein zus?tz licher Blick auf das platonisch-akademische 'zweite Prinzip5 und dessen Abwand lungen macht die Einheit des aristotelischen Hyleprinzips ?ber jeden Zweifel gewi?? (32). Similar remarks on pp. 804. 807 f, etc.</page><page sequence="4">648 Ch. H. Kahn: Happ, Hyle in any way to the analysis of change given in Physics A. He has as it were systematically severed the connections between Aristotle's subject-attribute analysis of predication and the substrate-form analysis of change by his own terminological decision to render tj7tox?L[X?vov as 'Subjekt* in the one case and as 'Substrat' in the other. As far as I can see, H. nowhere tries to overcome this arbitrary dichotomy. Thus, although he care fully observes that in Physics A the 'substrate' of change is typically a cfully determin ate particular substance, e. g. man' (298), he does not mention the fact that this is also the paradigm subject for pr?dicat on in the Categories. But this common paradigm guarantees the unity of the concept expressed by ?7tox?L(ji?vov in each case. Hence H. misses the crucial clue to understanding Aristotle's concept of matter as an 'analogical* concept based upon, and implicition, the subject-attribute analysis of predication. As a result, he speaks misleadingly of the ?Doppelbedeutung von 'Substrat'?, on the grounds that the term denotes ?zweierlei diametral Verschiedenes?: the fully determi nate substance, and the indeterminate matter (284). But Aristotle's concept of matter is created precisely by the extension of his U7uox??[X?Vov-xaT7)yopo?(ji?vov analysis to the case where the substantial form is the predicated determination. The term u7tox?L[jl?vov is not ambiguous here: it expresses a single analogical concept. H. first analyzes the triadic scheme of Physics A - Form, Privation, Substrate - and remarks, correctly, that the concept of substrate here is essentially the same as that of material cause in Physics B and Met. A (290). He then discusses, under the title aprima materia?, the substrate of the elements as expounded above all in De Gen. Corr. B. 1, and shows that this is simply the lowest substrate5 reached by applying the triadic analysis to the most basic case of change, the genesis of the elements out of one another. The chapter ends with the insistence that prima materia as substrate for the elementary opposites must not be identified with the universal principle of Matter as such: prima materia is limited to the sublunar world and does not even extend to the aither. This last thesis is developed at length in chapter 5, cThe demarcation of the triadic scheme from above5. The aither must have matter of an entirely different sort, since it is not subject to sublunar opposites such as light and heavy, dry and wet. Its matter is a special kind of uXyj to7uxy) (or uXv] 7to&amp;?v 7uoi), the capacity to move from place to place but only in an eternal circular motion. Hence even this 'local matter5 is not identical with the capacity of sublunar bodies for change of place, since the latter capacity includes the possibility of standing still or moving in a straight line (502). This chapter includes a number of important comments on the hierarchical and ideological ordering of Aristotle's cosmos and on the religious significance for him of the radical immortality5 of celestial phenomena. Chapter 6 completes the account of matter in Aristotle's cosmology by dealing with what H. calls cthe demarcation of the triadic scheme from cbelow55. The concept of materia prima is lacking both in the biological writings and in Meteorol?gica IV. Leaving aside the disputed question of authenticity, H. shows that the element doctrine of Meteorol?gica IV is characterized by two distinct tendencies, one that correlates the four opposites pairwise with the four elements (i. e. the canonical view of De Gen. Corr., except for the absence here of an underlying substrate), and another tendency that ignores the elements and divides the opposite</page><page sequence="5">Ch. H. Kahn: Happ, Hyle 649 qualities into two groups: the active (hot and cold) and the passive (wet and dry). The second tendency is traced back to Presocratic physics and medicine (525-9. 535 f, etc.). This more traditional scheme of active and passive powers is also conspicuous in the biological writings. H. interprets the absence of prima materia here as showing that the triadic scheme is open 'from below5, but he recognizes that the more archaic system of opposites is not incompatible with the triadic analysis and that it is in fact integrated within the over-all ontological 'pyramid5 of Aristotle's cosmos (557). Chapter 7 deals with the fascinating topic of abstraction or concept formation, as an answer to the question how matter is knowable. The chapter is particularly rich in new ideas and careful documentation, de signed to exhibit abstraction in Aristotle as a kind of via negativa for attaining cognition of Matter as the ?absolut amorphesSeinsprinzip?(56o). The interpretation follows an almost neo-Platonic tendency to unify what seems disparate and to reconcile Aristotle's doctrines with those of Plato. Thus the rcp?? sv doctrine of Tocal meaning5 in Met. T 2 is presented as a integral part of the upward movement of knowledge cto the first principles5, to the Unmoved Mover; this is the positive complement for the negative process of atpxipeGic, or Subtracting5 the inessential features of one's subject matter (658f). At moments, as when one reads that human know ledge cgrasps the grounds of being for what is given'outside5 by turning inward and actualizing its own a priori contents5 (80; cf. 807), we wonder whether this is really Aristotle's teaching - or Plato's? or Augustine's? In this survey I have passed over the central chapter 4, entitled c7ikr?^oc als Materie-Prinzip in Metaphysik T/K5, because here more than elsewhere H.'s discussion goes far beyond the topic of matter as such. The first and larger section of the chapter (310-420) deals with the much-debated question of the object of Aristotle's metaphysics and the connection bet ween the various parts of what Aristotle calls cfirst philosophy5. H. offers what is perhaps the best case yet presented for the systematic unity of Aristotle's Metaphysics. Although he takes full account of the work of Jaeger, Merlan, and many others, he reaches a conclusion which is, after all, not very different in principle from that of Aquinas (as H. himself notes, 399 n. 431). H. recognizes four components of First Philosophy which are inseparably interwoven in the text of the Metaphysics as it stands, and which therefore cannot plausibly be explained as belonging to different periods in Aristotle's development. These are 1) ontology, or the doctrine of being qua being according to the categories, 2) cousiology5, or the doctrine of substances of different grades - perishable or sublunar, eternal celestial bodies, Unmoved Mover, 3) theology, or the doctrine of Unmoved Mover as such, and 4) inquiry into first principles or apyui (326). The accidental modes of being are connected with the being of substance by way of Trpo? sv unity; the grades of substance are connected together by the unity of a hierarchical and ideological series (Reihe, ?cps?yj?), abundantly illustrated by Academic parallels ; theology is the study of the</page><page sequence="6">650 Ch. H. Kahn: Happ, Hyle ts?o? or highest member of this series, which can be known only by proceeding upwards from the lower members. Hence ctheology5 begins with the ontology of perishable substance in Z-H-?, just as the proofs of the Unmoved Mover in A (and in Physics 0) begin with an account of natural generation and celestial rotation. Finally, the doctrine of universal causes and principles is scarcely distinguishable from the interconnections between the different grades of substance, seen now in descending order: the Prime Mover is the first cause, and 'universal because first5. Thus it is a mistake to read Z-H-0 as a study of perishable substances as such: ontology in that sense would be physics (E 1, 1026a 27-32). A causal account of generation and corruption necessarily depends upon explana tory principles that are, in fact, higher grades of substance (cf. De Gen. Corr. B. 10-11). The highest substance (or highest grade) is the final and efficient cause of all motion and change, indirectly governing the sublunar processes of generation and corruption by its direct influence on the motion of the eternal stars. I find this reconstruction of the systematic unity of Aristotle's Meta physics wholly convincing, and I would like to believe that (standing as it does upon the work of Patzig, D?carie, Reale, and others, 326) it represents a definitive solution to the old problems provoked by the patchwork appearance of the treatises and by the apparent conflict between the descriptions of First Philosophy as ontology and as theology. This general assent to H.'s position on the unity of the Metaphysics is not intended to exclude scepticism or disagreement on particular points. One fascinating suggestion, which for the moment I can neither accept nor reject, is H.'s interpretation of the formula to ov fj ov as indicating not only the study of categorial being by reference to substance but also the study of all substances in the light of their causal dependence upon First Substance (385-404, esp. 391). I suspect that H.'s claim is essentially correct - that the definition of First Philosophy in T 1 looks back to A 1-2 as well as forward to E 1 and A, and that to study 'being qua being' means to study all beings in their connection with the ultimate ?pxh cupon which depend the heavens and the nature of things' (A 7, 1072 *&gt; 14). But some of H.'s remarks in this connection seem to me confused and confusing. He systematically distorts the logical concept of Trpo? sv unity (as developed in T 2) by speaking abusively of the ?Pros-hen-Aufstieg zum G?ttlichen? in connection with the movement of metaphysical analysis from natural substances 'upwards' towards the First Cause (391 and often; cf. 324, where the highest substance is ?Zielpunkt des Pros-hen?). Here again we see the weakness of PL's grasp of the Categories. There is no reason to speak of a difference of meaning (Sinn) or an ambiguity (Vielfachbedeutung) in the concept of ouata simply because it applies to three radically different species of substance. 'Being' (ov) is ambiguous and requires a theory of Trpo? sv unity because there is of course no common ysvo? for the different categories. But although o?aioc as a y?vo? is wide and diverse, it is a ysvo? nonetheless. Hence the application of the term 'substance' to an animal, to the sun, and to the First Mover is no more ambiguous than the application of 'animal' to a man, an octopus, and an earthworm. In each case the term o?a?oc indicates an individual entity of a determinate sort (toSs ti) capable of existing by itself (^wpLGTOv). In virtue of this common character, substances are so called xa&lt;fr' sv or univocally, and no doctrine of Trpo? sv is required for the unity of the concept of o?oioc. In effect, H.'s construal of the phrase Trpo? sv in grammatical connection with expressions for striving and for motion upwards is neo-Platonic rather than Aristotelian. The doctrine of T 2 is a doctrine of Trpo? sv Xsyscr-frou.</page><page sequence="7">Ch. H. Kahn: Happ, Hyle 651 Another point, of little importance in itself but of some consequence for the doctrine of matter, is H.'s description of the Prime Mover not only as final and efficient cause but also as formal cause, and indeed as creine Form* (420, and passim). Now Aristotle does say that the highest substance is 'without matter', but he does not describe it as form, nor would it be meaningful for him to do so. (What would it be the form of?) Instead, its being is simply lv?py?ia. H.'s frequent reference to his two principles as 'pure form' and cpure matter' is another example of the quasi-Platonic rhetoric that is characteristic of this book, and that tends to distort an otherwise accurate account of Aristotle's own concepts. Less convincing is the attempt in the second part of chapter 4 (421-72) to extract a universal principle of Matter from Aristotle's curious use of the Academic GUG-uoiyioti in F 2 where all the opposites, arranged in two columns, are said to be 'reduced5 or 'referred5 to the One and the Many. H.'s discussion is probably the best commentary we have on this puzzling section of the Metaphysics (which, as Alexander tells us, reflects both the De Bono and a lost Aristotelian treatise on the opposites). What fails to carry conviction is H.'s identification of the One with the Unmoved Mover and hence, by implication, his identification of the Many with the alleged Aristotelian principle of pure matter and pure potentiality (470 f and the diagram on 445; cf. the more complex diagrams on 700f). H. recognizes, in effect, the dubious nature of these identifications, since he claims that his central thesis concerning the principle of pure Matter is essentially independent of the controversial interpretation of V 2 (472). On what, then, does this thesis depend for its credibility? In Met. Z 3 H. finds a reference to the 'universal and highest matter principle5 in Aristotle's description of matter as 'what is said per se (xocfr' ocutyjv) to be neither something (tl) nor so much (nocrov) nor anything else by which being is determined5 (1029a 20). For reasons which are not entirely clear, H. wishes to distinguish the concept of matter mentioned here both from the generalized subject of change in Physics A and also from materia prima, the specialized subject of elemental change (662-6). But again he claims that the recognition of a distinct universal principle of matter behind all the specific types does not depend upon the proposed inter pretation of Met. Z 3, but is established by the overall evidence (666). This evidence is collected in the final chapter 8. I here summarize H.'s principal evidence, and give my objections to his conclusion in each case. 1. Since the matter of perishable substances and of celestial bodies are said to be cthe same in y?vo?' (De Gen. Corr. B 9, 335 a 29), and since this suggests a unity closer than sameness by ?vocXoy?a, there must be something that binds together the sublunar and celestial principles of matter (679-93). But the answer to this is given by H. himself (680): in both cases the material cause represents a) a Substrate' or subject for change, and b) the 8?vau.ic to be other than it is at any given moment. We have, in short, the ?t:ox?lu.?vov of Physics A, more fully analyzed here by its connection with the concept of Sovocu-i?, a connection which is suggested in a programatic way in Physics A (191fr 27-29). 2. The unity of causes by proportion or 'analogy' in A 4-5 requires a irpo? lv relation to a ?Hyle im Ursinn?, a principle of pure matter beyond the matter of physical bodies (685). As I have argued above (p. 650), this represents a serious confusion be tween the nrpo? ?v and ?vaXoy?a relations among items in different categories, on the</page><page sequence="8">652 Ch. H. Kahn: Happ, Hyle one hand, and the hierarchical ranking (Reihe) of substances on the other. An Aristotelian series does normally have a first and last term, and the series of substances stretches from a topmost member, which is pure Act without matter, downwards to a lowest member in prima materia, the infra-substantial potency for the elemental opposites; which potency, when informed by these opposites, is constituted as the elementary bodies. But there is no need in such a series for a Tupo? sv focus or 'con vergence' on some principle that lies outside the series itself. Nor in the case of an ?vaXoy?a, a proportional relation of the form 'A stands to B as C stands to D', is there any reference whatsoever to a unity or concept that would be distinct both from the relationship so defined and from the terms which compose it. 3. In addition to the privileged \fkr\ totuixy) of the heavens, which is not a subject for opposites, there is the motionless \iki\ voyjtt] for geometric forms, and also the logical or conceptual oXyj for definitions, i. e. the genus as matter for the species-forms. The concept of uXv) is thus generalized beyond opposites, beyond change, and even beyond corporeal extension. For H. this generalization points to an ultimate s? o?, a principle of matter that can only be designated as 'pure possibility' (698). But the answer to this has already been given under 1 and 2. The same structural parallelism that justifies Aristotle's original extension of the concept of utuoxsl(jlsvov, from 1) a substan tial subject for attributes to 2) a material substrate for substantial form, will justify his further extensions of the concept of matter to 3) the unchanging matter of eternal bodies and celestial motion, 4) geometric 'space' as the substrate for geometric forms, and 5) the genus as 'logical' substrate for species-forms. It is probably correct to say that this generalization by ?vaXoy?a is based (from Aristotle's point of view) upon an objectively given subject-attribute, substrate-form, or potency-act structure that pervades all reality, except that of the Unmoved Mover. But there is no justification whatsoever for inferring that this structure requires a Tupo? sv relation to a single, universal principle of pure possibility. The general statement of the potency-act relation is explicitly analogical (at ? 6, 1048 a 30- &amp; 9), just as is the general definition or elucidation of the matter-form pairing (Physics A 7, 191 a 8-13).x The latter passage says of matter, as ?tuoxs^svy) cp?aic 'known by ?vaXoy?a', that it is 'one ?px^, but it is not one and not a being in the way of some definite thing (o?/ outco [jtia o?cra o?Ss outco? ?v ?)? t? t?Ss tl)\ For Aristotle there can be no single principle of pure poten tiality as a counterpart to the Unmoved Mover as pure actuality, precisely because the latter is, and the former is not, a substance: a definite independent entity or individual, /copiCTTov xai toSs ti. In the last analysis, H.'s reconstruction of Aristotelian dualism falls victim to the criticism that Aristotle himself levelled against the Platonists : they erred not in their concern with the opposites but in their neglect of the prior concept of substance {T 2, 1004 *&gt; 8-10). Because of this error in its central thesis, H.'s book cannot be regarded as the classical treatment of its topic, which in many respects it deserves to be. For the book does provide decisive clarification, and in some cases definitive solutions, to important and difficult problems. Even those readers who cannot accept the author's thesis will warmly welcome this book as a major contribution to Aristotelian scholarship. University of Pennsylvania Charles H. Kahn 1 If one looks for a formula that isolates what is common in the various cases covered by the 'analogy', one can point to a) the concept of a substrate or subject for determinations, and b) the possibility for the same subject to be determined in more than one way. The first concept relies on the second for its elucidation, i. e. the concept of ijTuoxsipLsvov cannot be fully articulated without introducing the concept of Suva^i?. H. himself notes the essential role of these two concepts in discussing the farthest extension of the notion of matter, as a single genus to be determined by alternative species-forms (640: ?Vergleichspunkte sind f?r ihn &lt;sc. Aristoteles) einmal der Substratbegriff . . . zum andern der M?glichkeitsbegriff?).</page></plain_text>
