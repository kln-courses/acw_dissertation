<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE UNIVERSE OF ANDRI MASSON BY JOHN ALFORD SINCE the COLLEGE ART JOURNAL commenced publication in November 1941, a series of articles on "modern art" has been published, debating first the question of what place the study of contemporary art should be given in the curricula of college art departments, and more recently the nature and value of "modern art" itself. M. Masson's recent book, Anatomy of My Universe,' in the course of forty-six pages of drawings and commentaries illus- trates more of the points in debate than any other single work of my acquaintance. M. Masson, however, does not provide a text-book of theory. He does not even provide a consecutive exposition of any coherent system of ideas. He acts in the specifically private, intuitive and aesthetic manner to which we have come to limit the word art. The words of his own prologue read pretentiously in English, but the printed version is safer to give than a reinterpretation: "This graphic world is a universe that I create. It is composed of images that fill my expectation, signified by the sheet of white paper. Whence come these imagined forms? They come from my impassioned meditation, an attitude that poses an object, even in its first movement when it seems to be completely sunk in the undetermined. But soon, as in the process of dream- inducing hallucination, or after a first stage composed uniquely of vertical schemes, there appear forms already plastic like dreams and this meditative disposition calls up forgotten sensations, buried dreams. It is their polymorphous play that I orchestrate in their becoming. "But to what has this gushing forth of different elements responded? It has responded to the call of desire. "The dream is not content to compensate desires dead from inanition, it may also give life to what is cold and abstract in our waking thought." M. Masson's images are, in fact, the obvious products and sym- bols of thinking in terms of universals as well as images of "for- gotten sensations, buried dreams." If they are not what M. Coo- 1Andr6 Masson, Anatomy of My Universe, 34 pl., and text. New York, 1943, Curt Valentin. $6.oo. 42</page><page sequence="2">maraswamy demands that all art should be, "injunctive, moving us to do this or that," they are at least "speculative, that is, referent of the activity to its principle" (C.A.J., II, 4; pp. 123-4). The fantasy of the drawings is governed by certain easily definable pre-occupations. All are biomorphs; that is, images of living forms. Indeed, the great majority are anthropomorphs. But the forms themselves are composed of different sorts of constituents, and the dominant imaginative urge is to break down the divisions between intellectually distinguished categories. The titles of the first chapter, and of the first two plates are: "The Demon of Analogy," "The Fraternity of the Natural Kingdoms," and "The Unity of the Cosmos." The first plate consists of a series of slight drawings of bodies and heads, in which a pseudo-geometric diagram suggests at the same time a human figure and, in part, a bird, and in another part the shoot of a plant; while other sketches merge a skull and plant ramification, a flint and a snake's head, and so on. "The Unity of the Cosmos" takes this not unfamiliar process to more complex development. The merging of linear and solid geometry, anthropomorph, biomorph, geomorph and skeuomorph (artefact form) here, and in many later plates, achieves a richness and intensity of imaginative integration unsurpassed within my ac- quaintance in the art of this epoch. This recognition and trans- cendence of categories in a drama in which all forms participate, is the dominant characteristic of the book, and of an imaginative "universe" which M. Masson shares in kind with many of the most "creative" of his older contemporaries; it is hardly necessary to elaborate a list of names. To Picasso and to Dali he owes, I think, a specific debt, though both his commentaries and his images sug- gest a more systematically trained intelligence than that of Picasso, while his imaginative realization is usually in a different class from Dali's insensitive and pedantically laborious technique. In this freedom of imagination M. Masson has long allied himself with the ultra "romantics" of Surrealist sort, and the alliance is further illustrated in the Freudian themes of many of these draw- ings. But the reference to categories, the deliberate process of syn- thesis and transcendence, and the expression of an essential condi- tion of metamorphosis and flux, suggest a sympathetic acquaintance with modern philosophies the aim of which is to supply an intel- lectual sanction for the intuition of universal organic process which the empirical and analytical methods of science have so drastically disfavoured. 43</page><page sequence="3">M. Masson is not, however, a philosopher; he is an artist with philosophic interests. He does not "describe the universe which man, on the basis of rational thought, accepts as surrounding him," but expresses "the kind of world by which he feels himself sur- rounded" (Joachim Weyl, "Science and Abstract Art," C.A.J., II, 2; p. 43). Moreover, his first sympathy is clearly not with contemporary thought at all, but with the neo-Platonic syncretism or philosophic amalgam of the early Renaissance. If in the sayings of Cezanne about the geometric structure of nature, "the physicist will hear Galileo speak" rather than a mathematician or physicist of the modern world (Weyl, loc. cit., p. 44), in the drawings and commen- taries of Masson the reader-spectator will find a reflection of the semi-philosophic, semi-magical universe of Pico della Mirandola, with whose famous panegyric from the dissertation "On the Dignity of Man" M. Masson, in fact, concludes his own book. But whereas Pico's universe was one of radiant expectation, M. Masson's ap- pears to be one of tragic conflict and frustration. It would seem to me perverse to pretend that art of this nature is not moral in implication. The fact that there is no direct "injunc- tion, moving us to do this or that," that no one is the more likely to commit rape or murder this evening for having witnessed the violent atrocities of M. Masson's biomorphic kitchen furniture this morning, does not preclude the possibility of a change of intellectual and moral direction from an acquaintance with such forms of expression and with their philosophic and cultural implications. The reply to Mr. Coomaraswamy's demand for a censorship of art is not (of course) that artistic expressions have no bearing on the conduct of affairs, but that the history of cultural censorship shows the inherent and too often disastrous dangers of culturally suppres- sive institutions. M. Masson's art is already an intellectual and emo- tional protest. In so far as his reactions are unique and peculiar they are of little public account. In so far as they are symptomatic of a cultural condition of social kind they deserve serious analytical attention over and beyond their achievement of imaginative realiza- tion; but-with curious and envious respect for the experiences of Mr. Goldwater (C.A.J., I, 4; pp. 90-93) and Mr. Schmeckebier (C.A.J., I, 3; PP- 76-8o0)-not by freshmen. For my part, in a fairly extensive experience, I have never met a group of freshmen with whom a serious discussion, as distinguished from the exchange of superficial and evasive remarks, about char- 44</page><page sequence="4">acteristically modern art (surrealism and the various phases of non- representationalism) has seemed imperative from their standpoint or profitable from mine. Simply by reason of its cultural specialization, such art is not accessible without special preparation. Dr. Mead's remarks about the sectionalism of modern culture (C.A.J., II, 4; P. 120o) are very relevant at this point, and in addition, there are the questions whether and why special preparation is justified to that end. (Samuel Cauman, "The Great Moderns-A Reappraisal," C.A.J., II, 4; PP. 103-lo9). These are not questions to be shirked if they arise in the incidental intercourse of student and teacher. In my own introductory course, in fact, I make reference to, and illustrate the existence of, such culturally specialized art while an analysis is in progress of the basic sensory and formal elements of visual imagination and technical expression inherent in the material arts. What is then under examination is the sensory and formal nature of the material arts as such, not the art of any special historical culture. Later in the same course the use of these elements in the expression of social purpose is also illustrated in relation to some of the major phases of the western cultural tradition. But for reasons already stated, a very minor position is given in this context to the cultural significance of the contemporary figurative arts. Those who major in fine art, or whose interest survives to a senior year, return eventually to the "modern" field, with as good an understanding of the historical, sociological and philosophical nature of its problems, as well as of aesthetic quality, as we can ensure by enlisting the active co-operation of other specialized departments. But even here we start the session-in accordance with the views of Mr. Goldwater (op. cit., p. 92)-with a review of the disintegration of the Renaissance classical tradition and of the rise of romanticism and of mechanical science. For such students M. Masson's universe will be generally intel- ligible in kind, whatever personal attitude is taken to his art. Indeed, his art may well seem the clearest available statement of the intellectual-aesthetic problem. How his universe is to be made in- telligible without such a preparation (again, whatever attitude is taken to his art) or how such a preparation can effectively be made in the course of a freshman year, I have not yet understood but may perhaps yet come to understand. There is, of course, much art of today which ignores M. Masson's universe: art which does not depart essentially from that of one or other of the various phases of the long humanistic and vitalistic 45</page><page sequence="5">traditions. But this is not what I suppose the protagonists of the introductory course in "modern art" to have in mind. If it is, then the private aesthetic enjoyment of such art is surely best cultivated by a correlative study of its greater prototypes. The tragedy of contem- porary figurative art is that it excels only in the expression of, or remotest flight from, fundamental discords such as those of M. Masson's universe.
