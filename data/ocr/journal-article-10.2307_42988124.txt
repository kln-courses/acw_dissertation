<plain_text><page sequence="1">Do Students Accept Anthropomorphic and Teleological Formulations as Scientific Explanations? E. Jungwirth Although we are again and again compelled by the high degree of complexity of organic events deliberately to simplify . . . and although It is advisable to use language illustratively in the explanation of such connections, still we must always be aware of the dangers which this involves. It is perhaps more difficult in biology than in the other natural sciences to be popular with- out being misleading. [7] How what immune Mainx are calls high school "illustrative and university circumlocutions" students to ? what Mainx calls "illustrative circumlocutions" ? Ghiselin says, "Such notions as the apparent purposefulness (of living organisms) are merely pseudo-problems to those fully aware of picture-thinking." [1] Are our students fully aware? That the use of analogies and metaphors in science teaching is prevalent needs no documentation. Teachers' use of such "verbal teaching aids" stems from the belief that their target populations of students are sufficiently mature and sophisticated to realize the intrinsic content and the philosophical implications of their teachers' "pictorial lan- guage," and that they can recognize an analogy for what it is and not accept it as an identity. Two types of "illustrative circumlocutions" will be dealt with in this paper: anthropomorphic explanations (i.e., attributing human thoughts or feelings to other living things) and the use of teleological formulations (i.e., design, purpose, or utility as explanation of any natural phenome- non). It will be assumed that neither are intended by teachers to be taken literally, and that the very use of such formulations is frowned upon by science education special- ists. This "official position" of the latter has been docu- mented in another study. [5] Discussion of the teleology /anthropomorphism problem in biology teaching (to be termed T/A problem or formula- tion from here on) with teachers and writing-team members has enabled this author to rank his discussants on a con- tinuum ranging from complete unawareness of the existence of the problem (both philosophical and pedagogical), through philosophical awareness coupled with unawareness, or even denial, of a teaching problem ("only complete fools can fail to see through the analogy or metaphor") , to awareness of both the philosophical and the pedagogical problems. The purpose of this study was to examine how readily biology students' accept T/A formulations as scientific ex- planations or descriptions, or, in effect, to ascertain whether This is an abridged version of a report presented to the Central Re- search Fund of The Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Interested readers can obtain the full report and the tests described from the author, Prof. Ehud Jungwirth, P. O. Box 12, Rehovot, Israel. the teachers' use of "pictorial language" is taken at face value by their students. Procedure In order to ascertain whether pupils do under- stand the concepts of T and A and reject them as unsuitable for use in scientific explanations or descriptions of biological phenomena, it was decided to proceed on two levels: 1. To present the students with a series of statements to accept or reject in a specific hypothetical situation, giving a reason for each decision. The students were not told what kind of concept was relevant in the test situation. The situations called thus for spontaneous student reactions (their recognition and rejection of T/A formulations mas- querading as scientific explanations or descriptions) . Three tests were constructed for this purpose (Test on Understanding the Language of Science (TULS) Forms A-C), since it was recognized that students might function in a different manner when presented with logically equal but outwardly dissimilar tasks. [3, 6] Several tests were thus required for crossvalidation (multiple diagnosis) . Form A required respondents to read 20 biological propo- sitions, 5 of them factual or causal statements and the rest T and A formulations, and to decide which of them they might want to use when writing an examination paper on the topic encountered. Reasons for choice (or rejection) were required. Form B required respondents to read the same 20 propo- sitions as in Form A and to state whether the T and /or A formulations (not identified as such, of course) were scien- tifically equal to the parallel factual or causal statements. Reasons for non-equivalence were required. Form C required respondents to read 20 propositions and to state whether they were suitable for inclusion in a school biology text as scientific explanation of the stated phe- nomena. This test contained five propositions each relating to man (as an organism), animals, and plants, and another five relating to man as a social being (where T/A explana- tions are in order). The last category was, however, not scored. Reasons for rejection were required. It was hy- pothesized that students' empathy with man (as organism), animals, and plants in descending order would be paralleled by their measure of willingness to accept T/A formulations. 2. Whereas in Forms A-C the onus of discovering what kind of concept to apply (philosophical or biological) rested with the students, in Form D respondents' attention was directed to propositions labelled "unscientific."

Furthermore, while Forms A-C served as instruments in the analytical mode only, Form D was to serve as an instrument in the constructive mode as well, requiring a synthesis, i.e., the formulation of the com- mon denominator of a series of statements labelled "un- scientific" (T and A separately) . The first and second trial versions of the TULS battery were administered to limited samples of Israeli tenth and twelfth grade students in order to obtain feedback informa- tion on reactions to both test content and test format. Much attention was paid to students' reasons for choice as indi- cators of misleading or insufficient instructions or item formulations. The third and final versions were administered during 1973-74 in Israel and 1974-75 (Forms A and B only) in Australia. Test populations It was decided to test for T/A acceptance at the following levels : 1. Toward the end of the tenth grade, since in Israel biology education for all terminates at that level. 2. Toward the end of the twelfth grade for college-bound students in "biological trend" classes approaching their matriculation. 3. Comparison groups of university students within the teacher education program for high school biology teachers. 4. Comparison groups of twelfth grade college-bound stu- dents of the "humanistic trend," whose science education had terminated with the tenth grade (Israel only) . Each form of TULS was administered to parallel samples of ten classes each at the tenth and twelfth grade levels, con- taining urban, rural, and agricultural schools in the same proportions and matched for teaching facilities and teacher and student populations. Form A only was administered to "humanistic trend" students, and Forms A and B only were used in Australia (where all schools were metropolitan) . It should be pointed out that no "comparative study" in the strict sense of that term was intended. The intention was solely to ascertain if the T/A syndrome was present in both countries and, if so, to what extent. The following numbers of students participated : Forms A B C D Total 10th grade (Israel) 220 306 273 287 1,086 " (Australia) 213 274 - - 487 12th grade (Israel) 129 189 191 180 689 " (Australia) 151 156 - - 307 12th grade (Israel) (Humanistic trend) 151 - - - 151 University (Israel) 39 22 41 34 131 " (Australia) 40 35 - - 75 Test Statistics (based on the Israeli population) Forms A B C D Reliability (K.R. 20) .85 .67 .92 .73 Correlation with IQa .26 - .05 .25 .19 aThe intelligence test used was the MILTA group Intelligence test, a local instrument developed at the School of Education of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Results The main findings will be given for each form of TULS separately. However, since - as will be seen - the results emerging from all forms were similar, only Form A results will be reported here in detail. Form A As is apparent from Table 1, a similar pattern emerges from all populations. The factual /causal statements, in pref- erence to T/A formulations, were by no means always the most attractive (except to the Israeli university students). Moreover, they were never the only choice for all respond- ents, and in many cases (not shown in Table 1) only for a minority. Very crude anthropomorphisms (e.g., plants "trying" or "being interested") were less popular, but their acceptance was by no means rare. However, more subtle A- statements (plants "manufacturing or dispatching" sub- stances) proved much more popular. T-statements were extremely popular (e.g., mutations "designed to provide," plants "developing features in order to"). Many students, at all levels, stated that such statements were preferable to "purely factual statements" because they included "the rea- sons why." Analyzing the reasons for choice of those accepting fac- tual/causal statements, it was found that only a minority of them (27 percent of the Israeli tenth graders and 45 percent of Israeli twelfth graders) had done so for explicit, or at least implied, T/A reasons. The data in Table 1 should thus be considered with this information in mind.

(The rest would use T and/or A formulations as well.)

Interschool and intraclass variabilities appear in Table 2. These results will be discussed later. Form B Here, the percentage of students who rejected the proposed equivalence of T or A formulations to factual statements was lower than the percentage who accepted this proposal - a situation analogous to that for Form A propositions. (See Table 3.) This was especially true of those students who mentioned T or A, either explicitly or by implication. Again, students were more likely to reject A-statements than T-statements, which were, in the main, regarded as equal in content to scientific (factual or causal) explanations or descriptions. The interschool variability here was even larger than on Form A, while intraclass ranges were of a similar spread.

From Table 4, it will be seen that: (1) Rejections of T/A formulations amounted to roughly 30 percent at both school levels, as compared with 60 to 70 percent at the university level. (2) Students' acceptance of T/A formula- tions was lowest for man, higher for plants, and highest for animals. The hypothesis stated in the description of Form C, above, must thus be rejected. As in Forms A and B, students' rejections of A were rela- tively frequent, but rejections of T were rare indeed. The raw material relating to twelfth grade Form C stu- dents was inadvertently destroyed during the author's ab- sence in Australia before tenth and twelfth grade differences had been analyzed. For the same reason, interschool and intraclass ranges could be computed for the tenth grade only. These were almost identical to those for Form A. Form D ( Israel only) This form was designed to test for T/A awareness in the constructive mode (as contrasted with the analytical modes of Forms A-C) and presented the students with situations labelled "unscientific." Results are given in Table 5. 1. A-scores were very much higher than T-scores (espe- cially in the tenth grade) , reinforcing the data obtained in Forms A-C. 2. The overall scores were indeed much higher than those obtained on Forms A-C. 3. There had been no significant improvement on A of twelfth over tenth grade students, but some improvement was shown on T. Interschool variability and intraclass ranges again paral- leled the findings on Forms A-C. Man Animals Plants 10th 12th Univ. 10th 12th Univ. 10th 12th Univ. 1.

Intel- ligence was not found to be a significant factor in this phenomenon, the proportion of variance accounted for by IQ-score correlations being negligible. The very large inter - school differences might, at first sight, be interpreted as the outcome of different measures of teacher emphasis regarding the imdesirability of T/A formulations in describing or ex- plaining biological phenomena. However, the very wide m¿raclass ranges would counterindicate such an interpreta- tion. They would imply, rather, the presence of wide within- class differences of the teachers' impact on their students in this respect. Thus, it would appear, by implication, that the teacher populations involved in this study did show a large measure of consensus regarding the T/A teaching problem. It should be pointed out that the study also uncovered an alarmingly distorted view of "evolution" and "adaptation." A "made-to-order" image of evolution (in T formulations) was readily accepted by the majority of the students, as were statements describing a sort of collusion between living organisms to develop in certain directions for specific pur- poses in order to meet certain, and presumably well-known by them, needs. Since scores on Form D were about twice as high on A and even higher on T than those on Forms A-C, it would appear that concept formation on T and A had stopped short of actual internalization, a large proportion of all popula- tions being unable to apply these concepts except when "pointed in the right direction," i.e. when told what kind of concepts were applicable in the situation. It is a well-known fact that children enter school "heavily burdened" with anthropomorphic interpretations of their environment. Indeed, "in the life of young children in in- dustrial cultures one of the principal functions of anthro- pomorphized animals is to serve as a medium for the trans- mission of values, and this function overshadows the real aspect of animals." [4] It is, therefore, interesting to note that the acceptance of A-notions related to animals (in Form C) was significantly higher than the acceptance of similar notions relating to man (as organism) and plants. One might be tempted to call this the "fairy tale syndrome." As for the almost total acceptance of T-explanations, the following quote from Hempel and Oppenheim might be relevant: "A teleological explanation tends to make us feel that we really 'understand' the phenomenon in question, because it is accounted for in terms of purposes, with which we are familiar. But it is important to distinguish here understanding in the psychological sense of empathie familiarity, from understanding in the theoretical, cognitive sense." [2] The inclination of the populations under dis- cussion to accept (or not to reject) T-formulations might thus be regarded as an outcome of the "empathie familiar- ity syndrome."

If such was the case with a select group of uni- versity students preparing to become teachers, the danger of a vicious circle becomes apparent. The data presented here should be useful in programs of pre- and in-service education of science teachers for the focusing of their attention on the existence, reality, and dimensions of the T/A teaching problem, especially in the teaching of biology. They should also be beneficial to text- book writers and others preparing material for the high school level. All such persons should not assume that T/A formulations are understood by students metaphorically or that students' T/A formulations are meant to be so under- stood, but rather that they "mirror faulty assumptions about the nature of the universe." [1] However, in the last analy- sis, it will be the teachers, with their day-to-day contact with the students, who will have the main responsibility. Their verbal formulations and their reactions to those of their students, both oral and written, will determine whether there will be a gradual elimination of the highly undesirable phenomenon exposed in this study. ■ References 1.
