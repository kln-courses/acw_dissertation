Wesleyan University 2006 ISSN: 0018-2656 THE INELUCTABLE LURE AND RISKS OF EXPERIENCE SONGS OF EXPERIENCE: MODERN AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN VARIATIONS ON A UNIVERSAL THEME. By Martin Jay. Berkeley: University of California Press, 2004. Pp. x, 431. Martin Jay introduces his masterful and ambitious study of the history of the con- cept of experience in modern thought by declaring: "'Experience,' it turns out, is a signifier that unleashes remarkable emotion in many who put special emphasis on it in their thought" (1). But why call the book Songs of Experience? Jay is aware of the apparent conceit in using this title of William Blake's poem cycle, but he intends it as an act of homage. "The temptation to borrow Blake's title is irresistible" because it perfectly fits his project: [M]y intention is not to provide yet another account of what "experience" really is or what it might be, but rather to understand why so many thinkers have felt compelled to do pre- cisely that. Many, if not all, have done so with an urgency and intensity that rarely accom- panies the attempt to define or explicate a concept. Theirs has been, I hope to show, as much "songs" of passion as sober analyses. At some times, these songs have been lyrical panegyrics, at others, elegiac laments, at still others, bitter denunciations, but they have almost always been deeply felt. (1) There is another reason why Jay speaks of "songs" in the plural. In narrating the history of a concept there is a strong temptation to impose coherence-perhaps more than the subject matter warrants. But throughout Jay seeks to balance the legitimate expectation of telling an intelligible story without tipping the balance to a forced coherence. There are conflicting and incompatible ways of conceiv- ing of experience, and there are different modalities of experience--epistemo- logical, religious, aesthetic, political, and so on. When Jay speaks of his experience of writing this book, he draws upon one of the German words that are translated as "experience," Erfahrung (frequently contrasted with Erlebnis). Jay notes that "Fahrt" (journey) is embedded in Erfahrung, a word that is also linked with the German word for danger (Gefahr). As we follow Jay on his journey, it is one that is filled with unexpected turns, risks, and dangers. At the conclusion of his Introduction he makes a frank admis- sion. "[T]he experience of writing Songs of Experience may lead me where I do not expect to go. You, the reader, will soon know how it will end: I, the author, am, at the moment of writing these words still eager to find out" (8). These words were written when he started his journey. In a footnote added six years later when he completed his manuscript, he writes: The normal convention of scholarly publication is to efface the traces of the process that produces the final result, a bit like covering over the brush strokes on what came to be</page><page sequence="2">262 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN called "licked canvases" of traditional painting. In so doing, however, what is produced is like the "secondary elaboration" Freud posited as one component of the dream work, in which the waking dreamer replaces the disorder of his nocturnal thoughts and feelings with a more coherent narrative. In so doing, he tacitly privileges a certain notion of expe- rience, one that provides retrospective coherence and closure in what was undergone at the time in a much more chaotic way. In fact, scholarly books strive to appear as if their arguments were concocted all at once without any reference to specificity of time and place of their actual genesis, what can be called their deitic particulars. But in so doing, they work to hide the experimental, uncertain character of their genesis, which is, after all, one of the alternative meanings of experience. (8) Jay does not want to hide his brush strokes, and in following the paths and byways that he takes in his journey, one has the sense that Jay did not know quite where his exploration would take him-or where it would end. But-to switch metaphors-there are recurrent themes that reappear throughout Jay's study. The book can even be read as a cumulative argument challenging what has become a fashionable skepticism and condemnation of the appeal to experience. With the so-called "linguistic turn," it has been argued, we ought to abandon the concept of experience altogether. "In fact, the unlamented 'demise of experience' became in some quarters almost conventional wisdom" (3). Giorgio Agamben, for example, speaks of the "destruction of experience" and has written a (premature?) obituary: The question of experience can be approached nowadays only with an acknowledgement that it is no longer accessible to us. For just as modern man has been deprived of his biog- raphy, his experience has likewise been expropriated. Indeed, his incapacity to have and communicate experiences is perhaps one of the few self-certainties to which he can lay claim.* Jay is not insensitive to the criticisms that have been advanced against the appeal to experience by thinkers such as Richard Rorty and Joan W. Scott. Scott claims that the belief that shared experiences serve as the ultimate ground of cul- tural differences "undermines any attempt to explore the impersonal processes that construct the subject in the first place" (3). Despite her adamant denial of any foundationalist authority to the term, Scott writes, experience is not a word we can do without, although given its usage to essentialize iden- tity and reify the subject, it is tempting to abandon it altogether. But experience is so much a part of everyday language, so imbricated in our narratives that it seems futile to argue for its expulsion .... Given the ubiquity of the term, it seems to me more useful to work with it, to analyze its operations and redefine its meaning. (3-4) Jay agrees that "experience is not a word we can do without." This is true despite (or rather because of) the fact that "experience" resists being managed and con- trolled. Experience is, as Jay's subtitle indicates, "a universal theme." I want to outline Jay's project in order to orient a more detailed discussion of the stages of his journey. He begins with a brief survey of the concept of experi- ence from the Greeks to Montaigne and Bacon. Jay uses John Dewey's reflec- tions about the neglect and denigration of experience in classical thought as a * Giorgio Agamben, Infancy &amp; History: Essays on the Destruction of Experience, transl. Liz Heron (London: Verso, 1993), 13.</page><page sequence="3">THE INELUCTABLE LURE AND RISKS OF EXPERIENCE 263 guide. Dewey claims that this denigration of experience "prevailed unto the sev- enteenth century and was based on a contempt for the imperfections of mere opinion, as opposed to the certainties of science." According to Dewey, for Plato and the tradition he engendered, experience meant "enslavement to the past, to custom. Experience was almost equivalent to established customs formed not by reason or under intelligent control but by repetition and blind rule of thumb" (13). Although Jay raises several serious objections to Dewey's broad generalization, he nevertheless acknowledges that "these caveats notwithstanding, it is still hard to deny a certain truth to Dewey's characterization of the relatively modest role played by experience, however defined, in mainstream classical thought" (17). Jay's adventure really begins with Montaigne and Bacon. He doesn't hide his admiration and affection for Montaigne. Montaigne's "remarkable contribution to the discourse on experience has become a standard against which many others have been compared and often found wanting" (23). Montaigne's exquisite sen- sibility may even be said to define one of the poles of the discourse about expe- rience--one that recurs periodically like a leitmotif throughout subsequent histo- ry. We find important affinities between Montaigne and phenomenologists such as Merleau-Ponty (who greatly admired Montaigne), hermeneuticists such as Gadamer, and even pragmatists such as James and Dewey. Montaigne's celebrated essays, written in the sixteenth century, read more like tentative experiments rather than settled dogmas. Reversing the traditional hierarchical privileging of timeless verities over transient appearances and tacitly rejecting the mystical quest for unity with the divine, Montaigne boldly asserted, "I do not portray being; I portray passing." Time, he understood, should not be measured against a putative eternal plenitude and found wanting; living in the moment was not inferior to living for eternity. Nor could imperfect memory serve to total- ize the entire story into a fully meaningful narrative at the end of the day, however much it might be worth probing for shards of the past. (24) Montaigne never attempts to define or "manage" the concept of experience- even in his famous essay "Of Experience." He proceeds by anecdote, illustration, comparison, passing remarks-a "method" intended to illustrate the untidiness, the diversity, and the transient character of experience. Experience is filled with paradoxes, ironies, and disappointments. Montaigne exhibits a remarkable seren- ity and balance in learning to live with uncertainty and doubt. Yet he finds sol- ace in a world of contradictions and ambiguities. Despite Montaigne's judicious humanistic wisdom, he was an "inadequate model for modern man at his most restless and ambitious.... [Modem thinkers] wanted to move out into the world and scrutinize it instead in the hope of finding new and reliable knowledge that would help master what had hitherto been outside of human control" (28). Bacon and Descartes exemplified this new spirit. They were distrustful of the variant of experience defended by Montaigne. They sought to transcend the prejudices of hoi polloi. Whereas Montaigne's approach was totalizing and dialectical, theirs was atomistic and reductive. "The 'quest for certainty' Dewey famously called the tradition that descended from Bacon and Descartes, a desire for knowledge that can transcend the framework out of which it emerges and earn from all rational men a justified confidence in its veracity" (31). "Experience" was now</page><page sequence="4">264 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN conceived and judged insofar as it contributes to (Bacon) or inhibits (Descartes) the project of advancing genuine knowledge of the world. Jay indicates four primary consequences of this new "fetish of method for the fortunes of 'experience"' (33): 1. identification of experience with verifiable experimentation, entailing a belief in the repeatability and public quality of expe- rience; 2. drawing a sharp distinction between the (idiosyncratic) psychological subject and the (universal) epistemological subject; 3. skepticism and disdain about history and so-called accumulated "past wisdom" achieved through expe- rience; and 4. replacement of the bodily learning derived from our senses by an appeal to allegedly more "objective" and "disinterested" instruments for evalu- ating experience. With this demand for a more objective, repeatable, and univer- salistic conception of experience, we find the beginnings of the dichotomy between the "merely" subjective and the "truly" objective that dominates and troubles so much of modem and contemporary thought. From this modem per- spective, with its demand for an objective, repeatable, verifiable account of expe- rience, Montaigne was viewed as "merely" indulging his "subjective" opinions and prejudices. The contrast between Montaigne, on one side, and Bacon and Descartes, on the other, sets the stage for Jay's narrative. Jay accepts a version of the Weberian thesis that "modernity has meant a differentiation of increasingly specialized value spheres" (38). Montaigne represents the attempt to develop an integrated and holistic conception of experience without forcing systematic unity upon experience. But with the advent of the new spirit represented by Bacon and Descartes, a more specialized conception of experience gains dominance. "The scientific version, based on a transcendental, disembodied, immortal species sub- ject located more in impartial instruments than fallible bodies, activated the ety- mological link . .. between experience and experiment, while suppressing the value of accumulated wisdom from the past" (38). Jay now follows this differentiation that modem thinkers relentlessly pursue. The epistemological understanding of experience became dominant in the eigh- teenth century. He traces the central debates about the cognitive understanding of experience in the works of Locke, Hume, and Kant. It is against this epistemo- logical background-frequently caricatured by subsequent thinkers--that the other modalities of experience are articulated. Jay explores the significance of experience in the moral and the religious realm (Schleiermacher, James, Otto, and Buber). He proceeds to art and aesthetic experience (from Kant to Dewey); political experience (Burke, Oakeshott, and the English Marxists); and historical experience (Dilthey, Collingwood, Scott, and Ankersmit). After this exploration of the different specialized modalities of experience, Jay turns to the attempts made by a wide range of thinkers in the last century to heal what they lamented as the ruptures of experience and generate or recover a more holistic alternative, restoring-at least to a certain extent-the outlook of Montaigne. Showing how that alter- native was premised on a radical critique of the Cartesian subject of modernity, produc- ing a seemingly paradoxical "experience without a subject," will be the task of our final chapters. (39)</page><page sequence="5">THE INELUCTABLE LURE AND RISKS OF EXPERIENCE 265 In this second part of his book, Jay explores the debate about experience in the American pragmatic tradition (James, Dewey, and Rorty); the lament about the crisis of experience (Benjamin and Adorno); and finally the poststructuralist reconstitution of experience (Bataille, Barthes, and Foucault). The range in these songs of experience is breathtaking. One would like to pause in order to listen more carefully for nuances and shadings before being rap- idly hurried on to the next cycle. We can, however, begin to discern the dynam- ic overarching structure of Jay's narrative. I would characterize his project as quasi-Hegelian-and the qualifying "quasi" is crucial. Unlike Hegel, Jay dis- claims any overall synthetic unity. There is no grand Aufhebung. Unlike Hegel, Jay does not want to suggest that each moment or stage in this development is somehow integrated into the next stage. But there is nevertheless a basic struc- ture that bears an affinity with Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit. With Montaigne we are introduced to a holistic conception of experience. Structurally, this is like Hegel's invocation of the na've holism of early Greek Sittlichkeit and culture. We cannot remain satisfied with this naive holism. There is a "necessity" to pass beyond it-and with this passing beyond, there is now a process of diremption, fragmentation, and specialization. We also come to see the one-sidedness of the different modalities of experience. In the twentieth century, a wide range of attempts is made "to heal what they lamented as the ruptures of experience and generate or recover a more holistic alternative .. . " (39). (The very language of "healing," "rupture," and "holism" owes a great to Hegel.) We, the readers, par- ticipate in this journey-as we do with Phenomenology of Spirit-a journey that Hegel calls Erfahrung. There is a further analogy with Hegel. Jay brings forth the "truth" that is implicit in the changing conceptions of experience--even when they are incompatible with each other. They are not "moments" or stages in a sin- gle dialectical process, but Jay enables us to appreciate the insights gleaned (as well as the limitations) as thinkers struggle to articulate what they take to be most vital about experience. It is not possible to do justice to the sheer diversity of thinkers and the ambi- tiousness of Jay's adventures. I will examine the highlights of a few of the spe- cialized modalities of experience that Jay explores, briefly indicating how prob- lems and tensions that arise in them are echoed in other modalities. I also want to examine his claim that in the twentieth century we find several attempts to overcome the fragmentation of experience in order to achieve a more holistic understanding of experience-"experience without a subject." I will conclude with some comments about the overall project. After outlining the plan of his journey Jay gives an account of the epistemologi- cal conception of experience that has dominated so much of philosophy since the eighteenth century. Focusing on Locke, Hume, and Kant makes good sense given their historical importance and their influence on subsequent philosophical think- ing. Jay avoids "textbook" presentations of these thinkers and presents the read- er with the divergent interpretations that have been debated in the scholarly lit- erature. For example, in his discussion of Hume he explores the conflict that has arisen between those who emphasize Hume's skepticism as opposed to those</page><page sequence="6">266 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN who read Hume as developing a robust naturalism. But overall there is little that is fresh and original in this discussion of the epistemological notion of experi- ence. It is familiar territory to those acquainted with the history of modern phi- losophy. One doesn't get a vivid sense about why the epistemological issues raised by Locke, Hume, and Kant have played such a dominant and persistent role in philosophy right up to current heated debates. It is almost as if Jay felt the necessity to get through this "song of experience" (there really isn't much "singing" here) in order to get on with what interests him much more-the modalities of experience that arose in reaction to the limitations of the epistemo- logical conception of experience. The song cycle about religious experience is much more interesting and dis- plays Jay's originality. The juxtaposition of Schleiermacher, William James, Rudolf Otto, and Martin Buber is insightful and provocative. Almost as soon as Kant published his critical philosophy, a lively debate broke out about the char- acter of religious experience. A standard complaint about the Kantian under- standing of religion is that Kant concentrates almost exclusively on the moral content of religion (Christianity) and seeks to confine "religion" within the lim- its of practical reason. Schleiermacher sought to bring forth the intensity and dis- tinctiveness of religious feeling and experience, which he sharply distinguished from morality. Combining an inheritance from Pietism and German Romanti- cism, Schleiermacher defends "the emotional intensity of religious experience, the heart instead of the head, inner conviction more than external obedience" against the "cultural despisers" of religion (92). The qualities of religious expe- rience that Schleiermacher highlights are further explored by James, Otto, and the young Buber. "Schleiermacher must thus be accounted one of the founding fathers of what became known as Lebensphilosophie later in the [nineteenth] century" (95). With this introduction of Lebensphilophie, we follow the tangled controversies that arose between advocates of Erlebnis-the living intense immediacy of experience-and those defenders of Erfahrung-experience as a journey and cumulative learning process that develops over time. What is espe- cially fascinating about this song cycle is the way in which Jay brings out an important tension--one that recurs in the other modalities of experience. There is the danger of becoming so enamored with the psychological and human qual- ities of religious experience that there is a neglect of the object of religious expe- rience-God. The Swiss theologian, Karl Barth, was one of the sharpest critics of "the anthropomorphic psychologism engendered by [Schleiermacher's] allegedly 'subjectivist' exaggeration of the importance of experience" (100). "For Barth, Schleiermacher had forgotten that 'in a meaningful statement about God, God can only be thought of as the subject and not the predicate"' (101). The more one emphasizes the subjective, psychological, or phenomenological aspects of religious experience, the more one faces the danger of downplaying or neglecting what this religious experience is supposed to be about-God. Otto sought to address this problem with his insistence that at the heart of religious experience is the precisely numinous quality of the "Wholly Other." Otto "sought to reestablish the integrity of the Other of experience, the God whose existence the theologians of crisis had claimed was compromised by Schleiermacher and</page><page sequence="7">THE INELUCTABLE LURE AND RISKS OF EXPERIENCE 267 his descendants" (111). But none of the defenders of the integrity and distinc- tiveness of religious experience ever preserved this tension to the satisfaction of their critics. Moreover, Jay shows us how this difficulty breaks out in the other specialized modes of experience-the difficulty of preserving the tension between the "subjective" qualities of experience and what this experience is sup- posed to be about. In philosophical parlance, this is the problem of intentionali- ty. Later in his study, Jay emphasizes this point: For as we have seen in the cases of cognitive, religious, aesthetic, and political experience, unless some sort of tension is preserved between the subject of experience and the object-whether it be nature, God, things of beauty, or political goals-there is a danger of losing precisely the very encounter with otherness and the moment of passivity that are so deeply embedded in the concept of experience in most of its guises. (221) There is also another reason why twentieth-century thinkers have been much more cautious about the very idea of religious experience (whether personal or collective). "The defense of authentic religious experience had to be waged on two fronts: against both the hollow 'formalism' of orthodox doctrine and the excessive 'enthusiasm' of delusional, false belief' (88). But in dealing with reli- gious experience one cannot simply ignore or dismiss the cognitive issues that are so essential for "orthodox doctrine." All religions-implicitly or explicitly- make cognitive claims. Furthermore, it is extraordinarily difficult to distinguish the "authentic" aspects of religious Erlebnis from an irrational "enthusiasm"- an enthusiasm that all too easily slides into fanaticism. There is a slippery slope from Lebensphilosophie to the cult of Erlerbensmystik. This is what discredited Buber's appeal to Erlebnis for such thinkers as Walter Benjamin and Gershom Scholem. Nevertheless, one should not underestimate the recurring attractive power (and dangers) of the appeal to religious experience-as we are witnessing today throughout the world. Just as defenders of religious experience (mistakenly) thought that they could distinguish religious experience from epistemological experience, the difficulties proved much greater in trying to distinguish religious experience from aesthetic experience. Many of the same impulses that led to attempts to isolate and defend the autonomy of religious experience were also the sources for the defense of the autonomy of aesthetic experience. As we follow the intricate trajectory of the several attempts to defend the autonomy of aesthetic experience and, ultimately, the sovereignty of aesthetic experience, we encounter once again problems of the failure to preserve the tension between aesthetic experience as subjective and personal and-to use Heidegger's phrase-the thingly aspect of the work of art. Jay concludes his song cycle about aesthetic experience with a discussion of John Dewey's Art as Experience. He sees Dewey as attempting to keep alive the tension between aesthetic experience and the work of art within a more balanced and holistic understanding of experience. (I will discuss this when I consider the second part of Jay's narrative.) "Politics and Experience" is one of the most illuminating of Jay's song cycles, and it illustrates the perplexities that break out in any attempt to give a satisfac- tory of account of experience. Jay opens his discussion by presenting the chal- lenges thrust in the face of those who seek to appeal to a politics of experience.</page><page sequence="8">268 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN "A politics of experience," warns an eminent feminist critic, "is inevitably a conservative politics." Rather than a check against ideology, adds a Marxist theorist, experience is "ide- ology's homeland." "Experience," observes a third commentator, was routinely elevated above "analysis" by defenders of "reactionary modernism" in Germany. (170) There has been a long tradition in which conservative thinkers have appealed to the funded wisdom of experience. They have been suspicious of abstraction, the appeal to universal principles-and to what is frequently called "rational- ism." There is an affinity between the way Burke characterizes experience and Montaigne's reflections on experience. The major difference between Montaigne and Burke is that Burke is writing after what he takes to be the excesses of Enlightenment rationalism with its demand for "imposing" universal princi- ples-even if this requires terror. We find echoes of the type of debate between Burke and his critics in the twentieth-century debate between Gadamer and Habermas. As a matter of empirical fact, there have been plenty of progressive and radi- cal thinkers throughout modern history who have appealed to experience. But there is another interpretation of the claim that a "politics of experience" is inher- ently conservative. Despite the intentions of progressive thinkers and radicals, the appeal to political experience "inadvertently produces conservative out- comes" (170). This accusation was debated with a special vehemence in the argu- ments of twentieth-century "English Marxists." Jay's representative of a twentieth-century conservative thinker who appeals to experience is Michael Oakeshott. Oakeshott started his career as a neo- Hegelian influenced by the tradition of British idealism. After the Second World War and the victory of the Labor Party, Oakeshott emerged as a vigorous critic of what he called "rationalism in politics." Rationalism, as he understood it, favors what is abstract and untested over the concrete wisdom of experience. Rationalism presents itself as enlightened, but it is politically dangerous; it is the source of most of the evils in modern and contemporary political life. Oakeshott attacks the tradition emanating from Bacon and Descartes because it instigated a pernicious faith in the "sovereignty of technique." His critique of "instrumental reason" echoes many of the same arguments that we find in the left thinkers of the Frankfurt School. It also bears a strong resemblance to Heidegger's critique of the Gestell (enframing). Raymond Williams and E. P. Thompson gave Oakeshott's notion of experience a radical turn. Thompson drew upon the idea of the radical political experience of the working class. Thompson's monumental The Making of the English Working Class not only transformed the writing of social history-as a "history from below"-but sought to "recover the lost expe- rience of those forgotten by history" (196). The new social histories of those defeated and forgotten by history-from slave narratives to subaltern histories- are largely indebted to the pioneering work of Thompson and the famous History Workshop founded in Oxford in 1967. Jay takes up the bitter fights that broke out between the "humanist" radical thinkers such as Williams and Thompson and the new younger theoretical gener- ation (Perry Anderson and Terry Eagleton) who were influenced by the struc- turalist Marxism of Althusser. The "humanists" were accused of being fuzzy-</page><page sequence="9">THE INELUCTABLE LURE AND RISKS OF EXPERIENCE 269 minded, "sentimental romantics," lacking analytic finesse and tough-minded the- oretical rigor. They failed to grasp the way in which the appeal to experience is essentially ideological and conservative. The response by Thompson was no less vigorous in his polemical attack on the "poverty of theory." Jay does a beautiful job of summarizing some of the key moves and counter-moves in this intense debate. It would be foolish to think of anyone as the clear victor in these heated battles. Williams and Thompson finally acknowledged some of the crucial ambi- guities in their appeals to political experience, and the grand theoretical claims advanced by those defending a new, rigorous, "scientific" Marxism simply col- lapsed. What can we learn from this battle over the politics of experience? First, appeals to experience-depending on context-can be used to "justify" conser- vative and progressive options. Second, there is a "truth" implicit in the claims of the defenders of political experience (whether right or left) that one can learn from the collective practical wisdom of accumulated experience. But there is also a "truth" in those who argue that so-called experience can involve deep ideolog- ical prejudices that need to be subjected to rigorous critique. There is a significant overlap between the issues that arise in dealing with the role of experience in politics and in history. Ironically-given Jay's talents as a superb intellectual historian-the chapter "History and Experience" is one of the least satisfactory. Historians want to know if there is anything distinctive about historical experience. "History" can refer to the writing or telling of history and what the writing of history is about-what happened in the past. Questions arise concerning the experience of the historian and how this experience does (or does not) influence the writing of history. What precisely does it mean to describe or recover the experience of the historical agents that one is writing about? Is this really possible? An anxiety has plagued historians since the nineteenth century. In what sense, if any, can the writing of history be objective? What does it mean to be "objective"? The new infatuation with "discourse analysis" threatens the very idea of objectivity by suggesting that there is no escape from the linguistic social construction of historical experience. The specter that hovers over all of this is the specter of an unconstrained relativism. Jay does touch on these issues, but in a way that is confusing and sometimes frustrating. It makes good sense to start with Dilthey, who raises virtually all of these issues. Dilthey wanted to do justice to the irreducible distinctiveness of his- torical experience and to show that history could achieve its own form of objec- tive knowledge. The "spirit" of Dilthey's approach to history and experience is conveyed in a famous passage from his Introduction to the Human Sciences. There is no real blood flowing in the veins of the knowing subject fabricated by Locke, Hume, and Kant, but only the diluted juice of reason as mere intellectual activity. But dealing with the whole man in history and psychology led me to take the whole man-in the multiplicity of his powers: this willing-feeling-perceiving being-as the basis for explaining knowledge and its concepts (such as outer world, time, substance, cause), even though, to be sure, knowledge appears to weave these concepts solely out of raw materi- al it gets from perceiving, imagining, and thinking. (225)</page><page sequence="10">270 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN It is the "living experience" (Erlebnis) of historical agents that Dilthey thinks is the proper subject matter of history, and the task of the historian is to re-experi- ence past Erlebnis. The process by which the present historian enters into the experience of actors in the past is what Dilthey called "re-experiencing" (Nacherleben) or less frequently "re-creation" (Nachbilden), which goes beyond mere emotional empathy (Einfiihlung). "A thorough understanding of historical development is first achieved," Dilthey wrote, "when the course of events is re-experienced in imagination at the deepest points where the move- ment forward takes place." (230) But what precisely does it mean to "re-experience" or "recreate" the experience of past actors? Is this really possible? And how is the historian's own experience related to this project? Although Dilthey valiantly struggled with these issues, he never satisfactorily resolved them. Instead of systematically following the ways in which the issues raised by Dilthey were debated, Jay skips to a consideration of Collingwood. Collingwood was critical of what he took to be Dilthey's attempt to ground history in the psy- chology of historical agents (which is actually a distortion of Dilthey's project). In answering the question "of what can there be historical knowledge?" Collingwood explicitly tells us "of that which can be re-enacted in the historian's mind. In the first place, this must be experience. Of that which is not experience but the object of experience, there can be no history" (236). But for all of Collingwood's insight, he fails to give a clear account of what is involved in re- enactment. I have already indicated that Scott is one of Jay's representatives of those who critique the appeal to experience from the perspective of the (French) "linguistic turn." For Scott the appeal to experience is never innocent. Experience is not prior to language but is itself actively constituted by language and discourse. In her 1991 essay, "The Evidence of Experience," Scott sought to deconstruct and expose the hidden ideological assumptions in the appeal to experience by histo- rians, especially in dealing with issues of gender. Experience is not a founda- tional given, but rather "a constructed category." In short, experience as both the object of historical inquiry and something possessed by the contemporary historian seeking to re-experience or re-enact the past was inevitably mediated by precisely those linguistic and structural relations its celebrants sought to bracket. Only a radical resistance to any essentializing of categories like experience, which had to be understood as a contested rather than a discursive term, could restore a political dimension to historical inquiry. (251) Scott raises difficult issues for historians who still appeal to experience- whether it is the experience of the agents that they study or their own experience. After her "deconstruction" of experience, she fails to clarify just how this intractable concept is to be reconstructed. I have sought to convey a sense of the some of the primary issues and recur- ring motifs in the isolation of the different modalities of experience-epistemo- logical, religious, aesthetic, political, and historical. This specialization is not to be undervalued because it demands a greater specificity and articulation of the</page><page sequence="11">THE INELUCTABLE LURE AND RISKS OF EXPERIENCE 271 multiple meanings of experience. We have seen how difficult it is to separate these different modalities of experience-how they constantly "spill over" and implicate each other. Although there continue to be refinements and debates con- cerning them, Jay claims that something new has happened in the twentieth cen- tury-a "yearning" to overcome this modalization and fragmentation of experi- ence: It was perhaps only in the twentieth century that the chorus grew to encompass thinkers from many, often different, traditions-philosophical and political. Hoping to recapture a more robust, intense, and all-encompassing notion of experience-whether it be called "authentic" or "essential," or "pure" or "inner"-they sought to reverse the process of dif- ferentiation. Often betraying a sense of nostalgia for what had purportedly been lost by modalization, they hoped to make whole what had been torn asunder, reinvigorating a common lifeworld that had relinquished its coherent meaning with a development of sub- cultures of expertise. (263) At a very abstract level, one can see Jay's point. Yet when we turn to details of Jay's final three chapters where he describes several attempts to "recapture a more robust, intense, all-encompassing notion of experience," one seriously wonders whether we find anything that qualifies as an "all-encompassing notion of experience." In the three song cycles that he examines, it turns out that it is only the American pragmatic thinkers who self-consciously attempted to devel- op a new holistic conception of experience. Jay's recovery of the importance of the American pragmatic tradition's contri- bution to the understanding of experience is a significant achievement. This is a tradition that has been so badly caricatured that it is a pleasure to read Jay's sen- sitive and insightful discussion. He understands that at the heart of pragmatism is a rethinking and reconstruction of experience-one that does full justice to the cognitive, scientific, religious, aesthetic, political, and historical dimensions of experience. We have already noted the importance of William James in the song cycle of religious experience. Jay sees Dewey as seeking to restore some balance to some of the wild extremes taken in the trajectory of the discussion of aesthet- ic experience in the aftermath of Kant. There is a rhythm internal to "having an experience"-a rhythm in which there is a felt difficulty, a rupture, a tension that needs to be overcome and resolved. If this tension is successfully resolved then there is a new integrated wholeness-a consummation that Dewey calls the aes- thetic moment in experience. There is no ultimate finality here---only a continu- ous dynamic rhythm. Aesthetic experience is not a special genre or realm of experience. The aesthetic dimension is a pervasive quality of experience, and this quality can potentially characterize any experience-including scientific inquiry and practical activity. Dewey's conception of experience shows the traces of a Hegelian conception of Erfahrung. Dewey's distinctive understanding of experi- ence can be viewed as a naturalization and pluralization of Hegelian Erfahrung. Dewey was particularly sensitive to overcoming the rigid dichotomy of subject and object that has plagued so much of modemrn thought. The very distinction of subject and object is a changing, dynamic, functional distinction that arises with- in experience itself. Consequently, experience is never "merely" subjective. Experience as the transaction of an agent-patient with its environment is always involved with an "objective" world. Dewey and James integrate the passive, suf-</page><page sequence="12">272 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN fering, undergoing dimension of experience and the active, experimental sense of experience. Agency and pathos (undergoing) are inextricably connected. The pragmatists self-consciously integrate the differing conceptions of experience represented by Montaigne and Bacon. Montaigne and the pragmatists emphasize the ineradicable contingency and uncertainty of experience. They criticize the substitution of overly rationalized abstractions for the concrete untidiness of con- crete experience-the tendency to substitute epistemological abstractions for the dynamic "muchness" of concrete experience. Furthermore, Dewey emphasizes the political significance of experience and democratizes experience. He brings art and aesthetic experience back to the context of the everyday life of ordinary people. He argues that in the modem world much of our experience fluctuates between the extremes of excessive flaccidity or excessive rigidity. Dewey advo- cates a social and political ideal in which all experience becomes enriched, and funded with emotional and cognitive meaning. Consequently his moral and polit- ical ideal is also aesthetic. Even Dewey's reinterpretation of religious experience is compatible with this moral, political, and aesthetic conception of experience. The classical pragmatists' understanding of experience fits Jay's description of "a more robust, intense, and all-encompassing notion of experience." The adjec- tives "cognitive," "religious," "aesthetic," "political," "historical" do not name different types or genres of experience. Rather they name pervasive qualities and characteristics of a unified experience. When we turn to Jay's discussion of Benjamin and Adorno we seem to be in an entirely different world from the one inhabited by the pragmatists. For the most part, Benjamin and Adorno were completely ignorant of the work of the pragmatists. The "official" line of the first generation of the Frankfurt School was that pragmatism was little more than an American version of a discredited positivism. Benjamin and Adorno are preoccupied with the "crisis of experi- ence"-the loss of "real" experience. Jay's analysis of Benjamin is a tour de force. With great deftness, subtlety, and nuance he follows the complex twists and turns of Benjamin's reflection on experience from his earliest writings through the posthumous Arcades Project: From [the] humble origins in what he took to be his own earliest experiences, rather than from any systematic philosophical inquiry into the meaning of the term, grew what might well be called the most complex and lyrical song of experience in the long history we have been following in this book. Alternating between utopian hope and elegiac despair, com- bining theological impulses with materialist analysis, Benjamin's ruminations on the cri- sis of experience went beyond anything we have encountered in our previous discussions. Sharing with the American pragmatists, whose work he never seems to have directly known, a desire to overcome the modalization of experience into its component parts and heal the split between subject and object, Benjamin infused that desire with a messianic intensity that was absent from William James and John Dewey. And knowing first-hand the rupture of cultural continuity produced by the First World War, exile, and the threat of Fascist victory, he registered the crisis of experience in the modern world with a saturnine bleakness spared his sunnier American counterparts. (314) It is difficult to see that Benjamin and Adomrno are elaborating an "all-encom- passing notion of experience." Benjamin kept returning to, extending, and cri- tiquing Kant (just as Adorno did with Hegel), but there is scarcely any serious con-</page><page sequence="13">THE INELUCTABLE LURE AND RISKS OF EXPERIENCE 273 cern with integrating the scientific, experimental dimensions of experience into their understanding of experience. For all their lyricism and intensity, there is lit- tle in Benjamin or Adorno that shows that they had any deep understanding of the complex cognitive dimensions of experience that played such a significant role in the development of modem science. They are open to the criticism that their con- ceptions of experience are as one-sided as any of its earlier modalizations. This is even more evident in the thinkers that Jay considers in his final song of experience, "The Poststructuralist Reconstitution of Experience." Jay chal- lenges the fashionable claim that with the linguistic turn--especially as repre- sented by French structuralism and poststructuralism-we must rid ourselves altogether of any vestiges of the "humanistic" concept of experience. Lyotard, Agamben, and Derrida (especially in his early writings) are critical of the con- cept of experience and the very idea of a subject who has experiences-a notion tainted by metaphysical humanism. But when we look more closely, there is con- siderably more complexity. Bataille, Barthes, Foucault (and even Derrida) recon- stitute the meaning of experience after the linguistic turn-without recourse to a centered subject. Bataille speaks of "inner experience." We might normally con- strue "inner experience" as some form of intense "subjective" experience. But paradoxically, it means something radically different in Bataille, the "willingness to live life as a radical experiment, involving the body as well as the mind, risk- ing danger in the quest for a certain version of redemption" (370). Bataille is obsessed with extremes: suffering, pain, ecstasy, rapture, and self-immolation. Inner experience is the experience of transgressing all limits. Foucault takes up this theme of transgression. In his "Preface to Transgression" Foucault hewed closely to Bataille's elaboration of an "inner experience" that paradoxically opens to "the outside," experience that exceeds vir- tually all traditional acceptations of the word, moving it into a realm of ecstatic self-denial that culminates in sexual excess, madness, and the limit-experience that is death. (393- 394) There are also tensions between this concern with limit-experiences and with his project of writing a genealogy and "history of truth." Foucault gives a suc- cinct characterization of his complicated project concerning experience in one of his late interviews: I have taken pains to understand how man had reduced some of his limit-experiences to objects of knowledge (connaissance): madness, death, crime. Here, if you like, the themes of George Bataille may be recognized, reconsidered from the point of view (optique) of a collective history, that of the West and its knowledge (savoir). The relationship between limit-experiences and the history of truth: I am more or less imprisoned or wrapped up in this tangle of problems. (399) Jay does show just how central the concept of experience is for these French thinkers with their fascination with limit-experiences and transgression, but his claim that they were engaged in the project of elaborating a new "all-encom- passing" holistic conception of experience is unpersuasive. I doubt whether Montaigne would have even recognized what Bataille and Foucault mean by</page><page sequence="14">274 RICHARD J. BERNSTEIN "inner experience." Their emphasis on extremes, limits, and transgression is anti- thetical to the spirit of his serene and balanced understanding of experience. It is time to step back and assess this complicated and fascinating journey. There is no other study that seeks to be as comprehensive and as exhaustive. Jay has a rare ability to treat the most varied ideas with subtlety, delicacy, and hermeneu- tical generosity. It is a stunning achievement. And yet, it is not completely satis- fying, in part because of its ambitiousness. Jay covers too much ground. For all its alleged comprehensiveness, one comes away with a sense of radical incom- pleteness. For example, when Jay explores the modalization of experience, he focuses his attention on religious, aesthetic, political, and historical experience as the specialized conceptions of experience. No one can doubt the importance of these songs of experience. But one can imagine a very different history that fore- grounds changing conceptions of social, economic, or legal experience. When Jay explores aesthetic experience, he is concerned primarily with the way in which philosophers think about aesthetic experience and art and not (with a few occasional exceptions) with the ways in which poets, novelists, and painters think about experience. (Except for a few incidental remarks, he does not even explain what Blake means by experience.) The lack of any sustained discussion of Freud and psychoanalysis is also a serious omission. Of course, there are lim- its to what is humanly possible to examine in a single book. But Jay's principle of selection is never entirely clear-what gets discussed and what gets omitted. And this indicates some other oddities. Jay is not writing a history of philosophy, but an intellectual history of variations on the theme of experience in modem European thought. Still, one wonders why Wittgenstein-and indeed the entire tradition of twentieth-century Anglo-American analytic philosophy-is so slighted. Or why Husserl-the founder of twentieth-century phenomenology- plays only a marginal role in this history. At other times, Jay's choice of figures seems idiosyncratic. F. R. Ankersmit is a provocative theorist who seeks to rethink the concept of historical experience in light of poststructuralist and post- modern ideas, but he hardly seems to be a central figure in the debates about his- tory and experience that have concerned most contemporary historians. There is another difficulty in Jay's seeking to be so comprehensive. Paradoxically, there is too little history here. In his introduction, Jay announces: "Our main cast of characters will be large and diverse enough to make any sus- tained attempt to contextualize the origin and development of their individual ideas practically impossible." Jay pays a heavy price for this limitation. By neglecting this historical contextualization, we do not have a concrete sense of what historical factors shaped the thinking of this large cast of characters. Occasionally-for example, in his discussion of Schleiermacher and Benjamin-when Jay does contextualize the origin and development of their thinking, we come away with a much thicker and more vivid sense of their think- ing about experience. Intellectual historians are confronted with opposing dan- gers. There is the danger of reductionism, of oversimplifying ideas to the extreme and attempting to account for them by appealing to non-intellectual historical</page><page sequence="15">THE INELUCTABLE LURE AND RISKS OF EXPERIENCE 275 variables in a gross and unconvincing manner. This is not a danger that even tempts Jay. But there is the opposite danger of abstracting ideas from the thick- ness of history-social, political, and cultural history. Jay is certainly aware of this danger. By dealing with such a large cast of characters, he has to sacrifice historical thick description for conceptual analysis. I also think there are problems with the overall historical structure of Jay's nar- rative--one that begins by evoking a holistic conception of experience in Montaigne; pursues the modalization and fragmentation that is characteristic of so much nineteenth-century thought; and culminates with the "yearning" to adumbrate a reconstructed holistic conception of experience in the twentieth cen- tury. As Jay himself indicates, Hegel, who already at the beginning of the nine- teenth century had a deep sense of the fragmentation of experience and charac- terized modernity as a era of fragmentation and diremption, sought to develop an ambitious, all-encompassing conception of Erfahrung. In short, we find the yearning for holism at the same time that we find the modalization of experience. Fragmentation seems just as prominent in the twentieth century as it was in ear- lier times-perhaps even more so. Despite the brilliance and originality of Benjamin, Adorno, Bataille, Barthes, and Foucault, I do not see them developing a new holistic understanding of experience. I do not think they can be character- ized as seeking to "generate or recover a more holistic alternative, restoring-at least to a certain extent-the views of Montaigne" (39). At the beginning of his book, Jay declares: " 'Experience,' of all the words in the philosophic vocabulary, is the most difficult to manage;' warns Michael Oakeshott ... ." Jay discovered just how difficult it is to manage "experience"- perhaps this is the significance of his remarks about not hiding the brush strokes. A skeptical reader might come away with the feeling that "experience" is not only difficult to manage but that it is a signifier that can take on the most diverse, idiosyncratic, and incompatible meanings. Consequently, it may be best to drop the term altogether. But there is another moral to be drawn from these songs of experience-the moral that Jay wants us to draw (and which I share). Despite the protean quality of "experience" and the ways in which it has taken on so many different shapes, there is something about this signifier that gives it a power, a lure, an intensity that makes it irresistible. The talk about its demise is premature. Like the return of the repressed, experience has a dynamic power of returning in ever-new guises. It may very well be that fragmentation, modalization, and the yearning for integration and holism are concurrent phenomena of modernity. Nevertheless, we cannot escape appealing to experience (in one of its multiple and dynamic shapes) in our irrepressible attempts to make sense of our being-in- the-world. RICHARD J.
