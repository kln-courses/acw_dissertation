<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Literary Approach to the Bible and Its Characters in Yefet ben 'Eli,s Commentary on the Book of Genesis: An Example of Competing Females in the Story of Abraham Marzena Zawanowska 1. Introduction The emergence of the Karaite movement, some time in the ninth century C.E., brought about a momentous change in the Jewish approach to biblical studies. Rejecting the whole corpus of rabbinic exegesis, the early Karaite exegetes faced the challenge of filling anew the vacuum thus created. Yet this process could by no means be called creatio ex nihilo\ it was, on the contrary, a most creative receptivity—a far-reaching reshaping and profound renewal of old traditions accumulated throughout centuries around the Holy Scripture, rather than its ultimate rejection. For the common core— the Bible—remained intact, albeit the approach to that core changed: omission of the "fence" of the Oral Torah (which in the rabbinic tradition constituted the only "gate" to the written one) gave direct access to the source. Consequently, characteristic of the formative period of the Karaite movement was a dialectical tension between renewal and continuity, typical of every new historical movement. Furthermore, from the very beginning Karaism was exposed to various influences— internal Jewish as well as external Muslim and Christian (mainly Syrian) ones. Consequently, Karaite hermeneutics constitutes one outcome of a fruitful encounter between diverse ideas and intellectual trends of that time, and for a number of centuries Karaite exegetes served as intermediaries between various schools of Jewish exegesis as well as between distinct monotheistic cultures.1 One of the most prominent and prolific Karaite commentators was Yefet ben 'Eli 1 For more on Karaite exegesis see Daniel Frank, "Karaite Exegesis,1' in Hebrew Bible/Old Testament: The History of its Interpretation (ed.

He lived at the turn of the tenth and eleventh centuries in Jerusalem, where he wrote an extensive commentary on the entire Bible in Judeo-Arabic. His aim was to create a kind of summa of the existing Karaite exegesis. Nonetheless his work goes far beyond summarizing, for Yefet ultimately appears as a great innovator in the field of hermeneutics. He introduced numerous changes in the form of biblical commentary (a paradigm of threefold structure, containing the original Hebrew text, interlinear translation into Arabic and commentary sensu stricto), as well as its content (utilizing three major foci, on historical, grammatical, and literary aspects, for a mainly literal-contextual analysis of the biblical text).2 Within the confines of the literary focus, the novelty of Yefet's hermeneutic undertaking manifests itself in his general perception of the Bible as a literary text, deserving literary analysis.3 This literary approach to Scripture is given voice at various levels of his commentary. First, it is already reflected in specific terminology drawn from Arabic literary analysis and liberally used by Yefet, to describe the Bible and its parts (for instance: קצה, נץ, פצל, כתאב, קרינה etc.) In addition, Yefet's attention is drawn to the literary character of the Bible in its formal aspects, in terms of both its manners of expression and style (עלי סביל/עלי טריק), and its general features of structure and composition (אכ'תצאר, זיאדה, אצ'אפה, רג'ע, נסק, etc.). Consequently, he is trying to reconstruct the literary process standing behind the final edition of the Bible as a book. Furthermore, when analysing the content of Scripture Yefet distinguishes, either directly or indirectly, three main literary features addressed by modem literary criticism: the role of the author-redactor or compiler-editor (מדרון), who is responsible for the intentional ordering and final edition of the Bible, and who to a Jewish-Arabic Literary Contacts at the Beginning of the Tenth Century (Tel-Aviv: Ha-Kibbutz ha-Meuhad, 1988 [Hebrew]).

Accordingly Yefet uses a wide range of verbs to describe his literary undertaking (4.(יתקדם, יכ'תסר, ימסק the narrative or plot of the story, provided with precisely defined (by Yefet) borders (א1ל אלפצל/אכ'ו־ אלפצל), as well as containing its principal parts such as introduction or exposition (צדד, מקדמה, אסתפתאח), and ending (/תמאם אלפצל כ'תם אלפצל). the protagonist (I mean here Yefef s understanding of biblical characters and their behaviour and not the literary concept of the protagonist, which he does not develop). The simple fact that Yefet pays attention to these three elements indicates that his approach is by and large a literary one, and as such it anticipates not only the later Spanish school of exegesis, but also modern biblical studies.5 Finally, Yefet attempts to analyse and interpret Scripture not only in the light of philosophical concepts and theological doctrines as elaborated by different religious "schools of thought" of the time such as mu 'tazilah (אלועד ואלועיד, אלפתץ' אלעקלייה ואלסמעייה, אלאמר ואלנהי), or by paying special attention to issues concerning religious law, halakhah (אלשריעה, דין ישראל, חקות הגוים), but also as if the biblical text were a secular literary text.6 To achieve this aim he makes extensive use of knowledge from various domains of secular studies, such as history, geography, linguistics (grammar), rhetoric, etc. 2. Hominis ficti In this paper I would like to discuss one aspect of the innovations introduced by Yefet within the context of his literary focus of interpretation, namely his perceptions of biblical personages as literary characters {hominis ficti). My approach differs from the research undertaken hitherto in that it emphasizes Yefefs deep psychological For a detailed description and analysis of the concept of the biblical narrator (al-mudawwin) see Meira Polliack, "The Karaite Conception of the Biblical Narrator (Mudawwin)," in Encyclopedia of Midrash (ed. Jacob Neusner and Alan J. Avery-Peck; Leiden: Brill, 2005), 350-74; idem, "The Voice of the Narrator and the Voice of the Characters." This is not to imply that Yefet should be classed as a precursor of modem literary theory, but merely to note the similarities between his categories of literary analysis and modem ones. On Karaite adaptation of Muslim philosophy see Haggai Ben-Shammai, "Kaläm in Medieval Jewish Philosophy," in History of Jewish Philosophy (ed. Daniel Frank and Oliver Leaman; London: Routledge, 1997), 115-48; idem, "Major Trends in Karaite Philosophy and Polemics in the Tenth and Eleventh Centuries," in Polliack, Karaite Judaism, 339-62, and the bibliography there. [71*]</page><page sequence="4">Marzena Zawanowska conception of biblical characters, which in my opinion stems from the exegete's unprecedented literary consciousness. The choice to scrutinize Yefet's literary approach to the Bible through the prism of hominis ficti is based on two premises: the portrait of such characters to a large extent depends on the interpreter, especially in such a "selectively silent"7 and succinct text as the Bible, where "the decisive points of the narrative alone are emphasized, what lies between is nonexistent; time and place are undefined and call for interpretation; thoughts and feeling remain unexpressed, are only suggested by the silence and the fragmentary speeches."8 according to literary criticism, the homo fictus "constitutes a driving force of the plot by determining its course and internal organization."9 Subsequently, the purpose of this analysis would be to check whether is it possible to see in Yefet a pioneer of the literary understanding of the biblical protagonists as genuine literary characters (towards "round character"). Or perhaps he should rather be seen as a successor to the rabbis' more idealized conceptions of these characters as eponyms or monodimensional icons10 used and abused in polemics (towards "flat character").11 In order to pursue this inquiry, I have chosen from amongst diverse biblical characters those protagonists who have most been exposed to tendentious interpretation, being frequently elevated by rabbinic tradition to the status of symbols or archetypes, devoid of ambiguity in thoughts and deeds. From amongst a varied selection of biblical stories about patriarchs I have chosen to focus on the story of Abraham, for under the historical circumstances in which Yefet wrote his magnum opus this story in particular ran the risk of being subject to stereotypical readings, be they apologetic Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative (New York: Basic Books, 1981), 115.

Since this paper is not focused on the concept of protagonist as such, 1 have limited myself to using one general definition of it, but I am fully aware of the existence of various different studies and approaches. There are numerous examples of Sarah and Hagar construed as symbolical figures in polemics, beginning with Philo, for whom they represented Scripture and Philosophy, and the Christian Paul, who interpreted them as allegory of the old and new covenants (Gal 4:21-32). Later Christian commentators followed in his footsteps, whereas Jewish commentators tended to perceive their allegorical relation as referring to the competition between Judaism and Islam. In literary criticism, "flat characters" are simplified and static: they neither undergo emotional changes, nor evolve over time. As opposed to these, "round characters" are more complex and dynamic: they change and develop over the course of a narrative. [72♦]</page><page sequence="5">Yefet ben 'Eli's Literary Approach to the Bible or polemical. Last but not least, taking into account that rabbinic commentaries tended to underestimate the role played by female protagonists in biblical narrative, too often reducing them to a "flat" and expressionless background for male actions, I decided to scrutinize Yefet's perception of the two main female protagonists in the story of Abraham, namely Sarah and Hagar. For the purpose of demonstrating Yefet's innovative approach to biblical protagonists in general, as exemplified by his perception of these two female protagonists in particular, I will focus on his interpretation of three different aspects which inter alia determine their characters, namely: motives for behaviour, reactions to various stimuli,12 and type of personality—passive or active, dynamic and capable of changing or static and invariable. Moreover, since the type of a literary protagonist and its features to some extent depend on his/her characterization,131 will briefly note the different methods of characterization used by Yefet. My analysis will be based on the critical edition and English translation of several chapters14 of Yefet's commentary on the Book of Genesis,15 which I am preparing as part of my Ph.D. dissertation. The examples cited below are but a small sampling of the available material which could be used to illustrate Yefet's treatment of character.16 The midrashic portrait of Sarai/Sarah and Hagar in this paper is mainly drawn from Bereshit Rabbah 45.1-10." It is widely accepted in literary criticism to judge the protagonist by his motives alone; even so I have decided to add the criterion of reaction to stimuli as a pertinent factor for the analysis of Yefet's perception of the biblical heroes, because in his commentary Yefet endeavours not only to reconstruct motives for the behaviour of biblical heroes, but also to provide an explanation for their reactions to stimuli. There are various ways to characterize the literary protagonist. The most basic distinction is between: direct characterization (statements by the narrator) and indirect characterization (report of the protagonist's actions, description of his/her appearance, comments of other heroes, direct speech or internal monologue). Chapters 15-18 and selected passages from chapters 12, 13, 21, 22, 25. The basic manuscripts used for this edition are: SP IOS B22, and B21, but I have also drawn on passages from B51, B217, B218. Subsequently, I compared these manuscripts with numerous manuscripts from all the major European and Russian collections housed in Berlin, Paris, London, Cambridge, and St. Petersburg. Translations of all the passages from Yefet's commentary on Genesis are my own. To translate the citations from the Hebrew Bible into English, I used the King James Version, albeit in somewhat modified form. In all the quoted passages, I have bolded the citations from the Hebrew Bible and italicized the text most relevant to our discussion. 1 have also consulted different Hebrew and English adaptation of midrashic stories, such as: Chaim Nachman Bialik and Yehoshua Hana Ravnitzky, Book of Legends: Legends from the Talmud and Midrash (Tel Aviv: Dvir, 2000 [Hebrew]); Louis Ginzberg, Legends of the Jews (7 vols.; Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1968). [73*</page><page sequence="6">Marzena Zawanowska 3. Examples 3.1. Motives for behaviour Tracing Yefet's understanding of motivations which determine the behaviour of selected biblical characters, as well as verifying their plausibility, particularly in relation to psychology, but also in terms of biology, sociology, and history, may provide insights into his perception of the literary protagonist in general. 3.1.1. Hagar So Sarai was entrusted to do so [i.e., to judge and punish Hagar] and she chastised her as needed; but it is not proper for us to say that Sarai oppressed her by abuse, because the angel said to Hagar "and let her [Sarai] abuse you" (Gen 16:9). And the meaning of abuse (is that) she scolded and punished her; and he [i.e., the author-redactor] explained it by the word "abuse" according to what entered Hagar's heart concerning this matter. For her heart became too haughty, and when she [Hagar] saw that Abram had returned the command over her to her mistress, there was nobody to rely on, so she ran away; for two reasons: First because of the haughtiness that seized her, so that she did not regard submission to her mistress as proper. And second because she thought that if she became angry and ran away, Abram would depart and send to look for her; and he would accept her (back) and censure her mistress for what she had done. (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:6) And he informed (us about) the reason why she [Hagar] went (away) from him [Ishmael] and said: "for she said, let me not see the death of the child." And (it was) as if she saw him writhing with thirst and on the point of death, so her heart could not bear to see him in that state.... And he [ie., the author-redactor] repeated (the phrase) so she sat down opposite to inform (us) that she wept when she sat down there, but she did not weep in front of the child though her heart was broken. And her weeping had (several) reasons: 1) She (was) separated from Abraham and his wealth; 2) The child was separated from the wealth of his father as well as the rest of the splendid promises; 3) She had departed, after being expelled, without either the willingness to or possibility of return; 4) Most difficult for her was the thirst that afflicted the child and (the fact that he was) on the point of death. (Yefet's commentary on Gen 21:16) In both fragments, Yefet's clarification describing the motives for Hagar's behaviour seems highly plausible from the psychological point of view. Having easily conceived and given birth to Abram's son, Hagar could have become proud of her motherhood and contemptuous towards her barren mistress. As the mother of Abram's only child, she might have felt like his genuine wife, and not obliged to obey Sarai; consequently, [74*]</page><page sequence="7">Yefet ben 'Eli's Literary Approach to the Bible it is possible that she expected Abram to follow her into the desert. Also, Hagar's affliction at seeing her son's suffering is highly plausible in terms of the bonds of affection between a mother and her son. In the midrash, Hagar is embittered and bears a grudge against God for not having fulfilled the promises concerning Abram's offspring, for in her opinion they referred to Ishmael. Furthermore, instead of praying to God, she "addresses her supplications to the idols of her youth.'"8 Yet in Yefet's endeavour to reduce Hagar's affliction (apparently evoked by harsh treatment) to the sphere of her feelings, it is possible to discern a slight apologetic tone, clearing Sarai of any guilt and making Hagar's punishment perfectly just. The method of characterization used here consists of statements on the part of the omniscient narrator that report the inner thoughts and feelings of the protagonist. 3.1.2. Sarai/Sarah When Sarai ascertained that it was indispensable for Abram to have offspring, who would inherit the Land of Canaan, (and) as she knew that the barrenness was in her and not in Abram, she, may peace be upon her, did not permit herself to refrain him from (taking another) wife so that he might have offspring. She did not want a divorce, but out of her kindness and faith she turned to him and made him a request to take her slave-girl in order to have offspring who would be counted as hers [Sarai's]; as she said: "it may be that I shall obtain children by her" (Gen 16:2). (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:1) Her words, "God has prevented me from bearing children" (Gen 16:2) introduce19 the giving of Hagar (to Abram). Their meaning is that if she were not barren, she would not have needed to make the request "go in to my slave-girl" (Gen 16:2). From her words "God has prevented me" we leam that she was certain of her barrenness and that she attributed this fact to the Master of the Universe, which indicates the power of her faith. She did not lose her faith during all of her stay in the Land of Haran (whose inhabitants) are Sabians,20 and attribute such actions to the stars. (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:3) According to Yefet, Sarai's conduct is calculated and her motives, as presented in both extracts, are most rational; they result from sober evaluation of the objective circumstances and logical deduction as to what should be done to change the current situation. In the midrash, by contrast, Sarai's decision is said to be dictated by the See Ginsberg, Legends of the Jews, 1:265. Literally: "constitute an introduction (אסתפתאח)." Sabians—in Jewish and Muslim tradition these are the inhabitants of the Land of Haran. The term is frequently used in both religions to designate idolaters and is often set in opposition to the monotheist Abraham. See Sarah Stroumsa, Freethinkers of Medieval Islam: Ibn al-Räwandi, Abu Bakr al-Räzi and Their Impact on Islamic Thought (Leiden: Brill, 1999), 162 ff. [75*]</page><page sequence="8">Marzena Zawanowska feelings of blame for Abram's childlessness, whereas Abram acceded to Sarai's proposal only when instructed to do so by the Holy Spirit.21 The reasons Yefet gives for Sarai's behaviour are plausible; nevertheless, they also appear idealized to some extent, and as such they might possibly be ascribed to a flat literary character, as well. Yefet depicts Sarai as the perfect wife, devoid of any trace of selfishness, entirely focused on her husband and his needs, willing to help him in fulfilling God's promise. Moreover, she is described as a perfectly pious woman of strong faith, having full confidence in God and his judgement, never losing her faith even while sojourning in the midst of the heathen. Yefet's method of characterization in this passage consists of objective reporting by the omniscient narrator, to describe the motives of the protagonist. 3.2. Reactions to stimuli In defining how Yefet perceives biblical heroes it is also useful to observe their reactions to external circumstances and to determine whether or not it is possible to classify these as plausible within the framework of common human reactions. 3.2.1. Hagar When Sarai saw Hagar's behaviour, she expected that Abram would disapprove of it; for when Hagar realized that she had conceived, she became great in her own eyes. She despised her mistress [Sarai], particularly when she heard God's promises to Abram and conceived the idea that they referred to her [Hagar's] offspring. She [Sarai] could not address her (even) with regard to the child, so she wanted Abram to disapprove of this and send her [Hagar] back to her [Sarai] until she [Hagar] would return to her previous behaviour. (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:5) And her question, "Have I also seen (God)?" means "Is it possible (that) I have indeed seen an angel of God22 speaking with me after he had seen me when I was running away under the worst conditions?" And her saying "also" (means) in addition to the kindness of God towards her [Hagar] when she (was) with Sarai and Abram. And it is also said that she thanked the Master of the Universe for returning her to the house of her master saying: 'Is it not really the main (thing that I) came back "after he had seen me" (when I was) Ber. Rab. 45:2. In this apologetic comment, Yefet strenuously tries to clear the Bible of any anthropomorphic tendencies. According to Yefet's interpretation Hagar saw an angel of God: "Is it possible (that) I have indeed seen an angel of God?" and not God himself as Scripture states: "Have I also seen God?" [76*]</page><page sequence="9">Yefet ben 'Eli's Literary Approach to the Bible running away on my own?' And (she) was saying these words after coming back to her mistress. (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:13) In the first extract Hagar's reaction to the pregnancy, namely, haughtiness and disdain towards barren Sarai, can be easily explained in psychological terms, and we have already noticed Yefet's penchant for psychological enquiry in the previous section. Nevertheless Hagar's reaction to God's announcement in the second extract seems rather improbable, if we take into account that Sarai had "abused" her to the point that she decided to run away. It might be that this part of Yefet's commentary reflects his apologetic endeavour to diminish Sarai's guilt and to justify her cruel behaviour towards Hagar. Therefore he depicts Hagar's improper attitude as the only cause of her "affliction," by stressing the fact that she had willfully run away from her mistress, for no other reason than pride; a situation curbed only by the angel's order to return and submit to Sarai. Yefet uses two methods of characterization here: straightforward description of the situation, and quotation of the protagonist's thoughts. 3.2.2. Sarai/Sarah And when she [Sarai] did not see Abram disapproving of this, she said to him: "May my anger be on you!" meaning by this "the injustice which came to me through Hagar is because of you, for she turned against me because of you." And she also said, "she [Hagar] wanted this injustice, which is happening to me. You must put an end to it, for she opposed me because of you and she is unable to tum against you and you must put an end to it... . I am not unjust towards her, for she is aggressive towards me and you should condemn it. And if you do not condemn her (behaviour), undoubtedly God will judge between you and me." (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:5) And (we should) not say that Sarah, may peace be upon her, did not believe in the deeds of God and His miracles or that He is capable of accomplishing anything that He wishes. But rather, when she heard (the messenger 's) speech, she was momentarily overcome by (the sort of emotions) that enter the human heart; as when one hears things which contradict the usual course of events, and pleasure or fright temporarily possesses them. And that (is) the normal reaction of most people, but when (they) return to (calm) reflection, they believe in the deeds of God and in His promise, and what fell upon their hearts at the first moment (is subsequently) withdrawn from them... . When Sarah heard that from the messenger, she denied her astonishment and said "I did not laugh." And the Scripture informs (us) that she denied (her laughter) for the fear of the messenger (which) had entered her heart, as it is said, "for she was afraid." (Yefet's commentary on Gen 18:15) [77*]</page><page sequence="10">Marzena Zawanowska In the first fragment, Yefet provides us with a description of a very human and psychologically probable reaction on Sarah's part, far from idealized. Her response to Hagar's boasting behaviour was anger, self-justification, and—to some extent— jealousy, desire for revenge, and an impulse to shift the blame to Abram. It was Sarai who had decided to marry Abram to one of her slave-girls and she who had chosen the wife for him. Yet, when the situation got out of her control, she turned to her husband in complaint and reproach, requesting him to intervene and accusing him of causing her affliction, notwithstanding the fact that Hagar was her "property," not his. In the midrash Sarai neither loses her temper, nor holds a grudge against Abram; rather, she is consistently "particularly tender" towards Hagar and simply feels sorrow at being treated so unjustly by her. In addition, she expresses her hope that Abram would take her part not, God forbid, to take revenge on Hagar, but to "restore peace to the household."23 In general, the midrash tends to idealize Sarai by underscoring her unusual qualities, such as devotion to Abram, patience towards Hagar, and piety. For instance, she is said to understand her sterility as a punishment from God for having temporarily left the Land of Israel (to escape the famine).24 In the second extract, the exegete explains Sarah's reaction to the announcement concerning the birth of Isaac as a common human reaction to unusual and unexpected events, manifesting itself by fear and bewilderment. Such an explanation of a biblical character's behaviour shows Yefet's deep psychological consciousness. The method of characterization used in this passage is that of reporting the vivid dialogue between protagonists. 3.3. Types of personality Another way of determining whether Yefet perceives a given protagonist as a genuine and "round" literary character or idealistic hero is to find out if the character is an active and dynamic hero who changes over time, or rather a passive and static one, invariably the same (whether good or bad). 3.3.3. Hagar It was mentioned that her name was Hagar, so we know that every time this name is mentioned it indicates Sarai's slave-girl. It is possible that she had other slave-girls apart from Hagar, but she chose her when she noticed her [Hagars] faith and reverence for her [Sarai], If she [Hagar] had not been 23 See Ginsberg, Legends of the Jews, 1:238. 24 See Ber. Rab. 45:2-3. For an English version see Ginsberg, Legends of the Jews, 1:237, and consult the further bibliography there. [78*</page><page sequence="11">Yefet ben 'Eli's Literary Approach to the Bible extremely religious, Abram would not have been pleased with her [Hagar] and she [Sarai] would not have chosen her for Abram. What shows us her [Hagar's] reverence for her [Sarai] are the words, "and when she saw that she had conceived, she looked with contempt at her mistress" (Gen 16:4). This indicates that the disdain started with the pregnancy. If the disdain had existed before the pregnancy, why did she [Sarai] mention it along with the pregnancy when she said to Abram, "May my anger be upon you" (Gen 16:5)? (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:1) And his statement: "she looked with contempt at her mistress" means that she [Hagar] changed her highly respectful behaviour, full of attentiveness and reverence, towards her mistress, from the way she was accustomed to behaving before the conception. And this was the deterioration indicated by Sarai's words. (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:4) In both samples Hagar is depicted by Yefet as the more dynamic and evolving protagonist. Initially, her virtues are underlined—she is said to be "extremely religious" and "lull of attentiveness and reverence for her mistress." Therefore Sarai chose her to be the mother of Abram's offspring. Yet, after the conception, Hagar entirely changed her behaviour in general and her attitude towards Sarai in particular; which, as we have noted, could certainly be justified from a psychological point of view. Having easily conceived, she was proud of her pregnancy, "became great in her own eyes," and began to conduct herself in a lofty manner. Haughty and certain of her superiority, she disdained her barren mistress. In both descriptions, slight polemical overtones are given expression, for in consequence of stressing Hagar's abrupt change, her punishment seems well-deserved. In the midrash Hagar is chosen, above all, because she is a king's daughter, and not so much for her own merits.25 In addition, she is depicted as a thoroughly wicked and ungrateful person, constantly laughing at Sarai and accusing her of causing her own sterility, which, in Hagar's opinion, fell upon Sarai as a punishment from God.26 In these passages, characterization proceeds by means of straightforward statements on the part of the narrator, describing the evolution of the protagonist. 3.3.2. Sarai/Sarah And her [Sarai] saying "go in to my slave-girl" is in the style of a request to him [Abram], for she knows that out of his affection for her he will bow to her wish and give her what she wants.... When he agreed with her, she married him to Hagar. (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:3) 25 Ber.Rab. 45:1. 26 Ber.Rab.A5A. [79*]</page><page sequence="12">Marzena Zawanowska Sarai 's words were in the style of informing Abram, so that he should put an end to Hagar 's injustice. And it is possible that Abram did not know anything about it, and when he heard of her complaint, it (was) hard for him; and he said to her: " What made it necessary for you to let me know about it and expect from me to correct her, for she is your slave-girl and your property? You are more entitled to condemn her, for she is your property and if I condemn her, I would cause her reverence for you to cease; here, she is in your hands, do with her as you wish." And although he had this meaning in mind, his words, "what is good in your opinion," indicate that he knew that she would do what should be done and relied on her judgment and her reason; for it is not the way of the righteous to see the injustice and not disapprove of it. (Yefet's commentary on Gen 16:6) In the above passages, Yefet describes Sarai as a changing protagonist by documenting the way her feelings and attitudes change gradually over time. At first, Sarai appears as a strong and active character, determined and taking important decisions concerning Abram's offspring into her own hands. For it is Sarai who takes the initiative to give her slave-girl to Abram, "so that he might have offspring," and it is Sarai who decides which slave-girl will be most suitable for this purpose. Deciding about many important things on her own, she hardly consults her husband and seems perfectly satisfied with his mere approval. However, when the situation seems to get out of her control, she turns to Abram in complaint and reproach, requesting him to interfere and accusing him of being the cause of her affliction, regardless of the fact that Hagar was her "property," not his. This extract also presents an interesting example of Abram's submission to his wife and his unquestioning passivity. Yefet states explicitly that Sarai married Abram to Hagar, and subsequently, as Yefet reports, even when asked for aid, he refrained from any action. (This is rather surprising if we take into account the fact that, in general, medieval Jewish exegetes tended to disregard the role of female characters in the biblical story.) In the midrash Abram also accedes to her proposal, nonetheless he himself takes Hagar and marries her. In this passage, the method of characterization is that of objective description by the narrator. All in all, both women—Sarai/Sarah and Hagar—are depicted in Yefet's commentary as very active and determined persons, to a large degree themselves deciding their own futures. This description differs from Yefet's perception of Abram/Abraham, who sometimes seems to be sketched as more passive, to the extent that he disappears in the shadow of his two competing women. Moreover, in the majority of cases the women's attitudes, behaviour, motivations, feelings and reactions are described and interpreted by Yefet, so as to give the characters realistic psychological depth.

Conclusions Yefet's project of a comprehensive commentary, intended to give a rational, literal and contextual interpretation of Scripture, is based on careful linguistic (grammatical as well as lexical) consideration of the Hebrew source. Consequently, in contrast to the rabbinic "atomizing" tendency to elaborate complex midrashim on small fragments of the text in isolation from the context, Yefet systematically follows the biblical text, verse by verse, provides the translation of each verse separately, and interprets it in relation to the broader story (the Bible as sui ipsus interpret). His unusual faithfiilness to the sacred text was expressed in the methodological statement: "Our method is to follow the biblical text and to act in accordance with what obligates the Holy Scripture"(27.(פסבילנא אן נתבע אלנץ ונעמל עלי מא יוג'בה אלנץ אלכרים Unlike midrashic readers of the Bible, Yefet neither tries to trace the esoteric, deep or didactic-moralistic dimension of the text, nor does he over-interpret by forcing the text to mean something more than it says in its exoteric layer. Moreover, as opposed to the rabbis, he seems to recognize the literary integrity of the Bible, presumably by assuming the cohesive unity of the text and its coherent narrative continuity. In addition, whereas midrashic thought strives for a certain mythicization28 or sanctification of reality, in which human deeds are evaluated—receive approval or condemnation—by God through miracles, the Holy Spirit, or a divine voice (רוח 29,(הקודש, בת קול Yefet's description does its best to be objective, irrespective of potential divine judgment as well as his own subjective evaluation. Apparently he limits himself to interpreting only those motives and feelings which are described or suggested by the text. Furthermore, in his interpretation of people's behaviour he takes into account psychological probability and draws his conclusions on the basis of a literal-contextual reading of the text, rather than accepted a priori evaluations of For the critical edition of the passage containing this statement see Haggai ben-Shammai, Efrat Batat, Sagit Butbul, David Sklare, Sarah Stroumsa, Judaeo-Arabic Manuscripts in the Firkovitch Collections: A Sample Catalogue (Jerusalem: Ben-Zvi Institute for the Study of Jewish Communities in the East, 2000), 141 [Judaeo-Arabic original], and 179 [Hebrew translation]. For the analysis of this statement see Meira Polliack, The Karaite Tradition of Arabic Bible Translation (Leiden: Brill, 1997), 37-45. The term "mythicization of reality" is used here to mean the attribution of certain fantastic features to the reality presented in sacred biblical history, as well as involvement of supernatural (divine) powers in this reality for the purpose of clarifying the incomprehensible, making and justifying the values, expressing and codifying religious beliefs, etc. For instance, as we have noted above, Abram acceded to Sarai's proposal to take Hagar as his "wife" under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit (Ber. Rab. 45:2). In addition, other rabbinic commentaries on the book of Genesis provide us with multiple examples of divine intervention in the life of the protagonists, aiming, for example, to confirm by miracles Sarai's wonderful conception (e.g., her unusually abundant lactation), or to prove Abram's fatherhood (e.g., Isaac's surprising resemblance to his father; b. B. Metsia 87a). [81*]</page><page sequence="14">Marzena Zawanowska biblical protagonists. He rarely attempts to justify or "acquit" them. In this respect, his perceptions of biblical protagonists contrast glaringly with the typical midrashic technique of idealizing Jewish patriarchs, sometimes taken to extremes.30 Only in a few instances, usually in the framework of polemics (plausibly fed by cultural bias or midrashic tradition), are stereotypical views given expression by means of apologetic descriptions of biblical protagonists and their actions. Most frequently, however, Yefet sketches a deep and complex portrait of the protagonists by presenting them as fully developed, multifaceted and dynamic agents of narrated history, developing over time and constantly evolving, ambiguous in their behaviour and ambivalent in their feelings. By doing so, he appears not only as a perspicacious literary critic, but also as a gifted psychologist trying to interpret the motivations, intentions, reactions and attitudes of biblical protagonists, whom in all likelihood he perceives as mere literary characters, within the confines of psychological probability and with dutiful respect to the wider context,31 as well to as the historical background of the narrative.32 (Nota bene: Keeping a balance between the characteristic and the typical, while those two qualities remain in dialectical relation where "the characteristic emphasizes the typical and the typical stresses the characteristic,"33 is a feature of the modem literary conception of the protagonist!). As for his methods of characterization, Yefet artfully varies in his means of presenting his characters. Far from being committed to one monolithic technique, he determinedly experiments with different methods of description—direct as well as indirect—shifting from dry statements about certain protagonists to reports illustrated with vivid dialogues. It seems plausible to accept as a working hypothesis that this unusually deep psychological perception of biblical protagonists on Yefet's part might be attributed We find numerous examples of rabbinic idealization of the biblical characters under discussion in Bereshit Rabbah (Ber. Rab. 45) and other midrashim, where Sarai is depicted as extraordinarily indulgent, patient and benevolent towards contemptuous Hagar, and where Abram is perfectly pious (e.g., attributing the fact that they were deprived of children to the sin of not dwelling in the Land of Israel; b. Yebamot 64a; t. Yebamot 8:4; y. Yebamot 6-7), understanding of Sarai's troubles, and just in judging Hagar. On Yefet's understanding of the concept of קרינה ("context") and his use of it as an exegetical principle see Yoram Erder, "The Approach of the Karaite Yefet ben 'Eli to Moral Problems in the Light of his Commentary on Exodus 3, 21-22," Sfunot 22 (1999): 323-24. Despite Yefet's numerous efforts to outline a "true" historical background for the interpreted biblical story or event, he sometimes apparently falls victim to anachronistic explanations, and seems to project the customs of his own time into the biblical past. For instance, while commenting on Gen 18:10, he states: "it is not permissible according to good manners (אדב) and religious law (דין) for a strange man to speak to a married woman, but rather (it should be done) through the mediator. And since Abraham, her [Sarah's] patron (ואלי) was present, (the messenger) directed to him the words, though their purpose was for Sarah." Glowinski et al., Outline, 331. [82*]</page><page sequence="15">Yefet ben 'Eli's Literary Approach to the Bible to two factors: Firstly, the Karaite movement's direct return to and firm commitment to the biblical text which intrinsically includes the potential awareness of the psychological richness of its protagonists. For "the biblical tale, through the most rigorous economy of means, leads us again and again to ponder complexities of motive and ambiguities of character because these are essential aspects of its vision of man, created by God, enjoying or suffering all the consequences of human freedom."34 Secondly, this perception could also be ascribed to Yefet's conception of the Bible as a text, although undoubtedly inspired by God, nevertheless written by a human author-redactor, in human conventional language, and as such open to elucidation with the aid of conventional tools. Consequently, his analysis of the text does not stray from its literary-contextual framework, for the interpretation is deeply rooted in the context of the text and can by no means evolve independently, as repeatedly took place in the rabbinic derash.15 34 Robert Alter, Art of Biblical Narrative, 22. Also: "The underlying biblical conception of character (...) in fact has greater affinity with dominant modem notions" (129). 35 Albeit sporadically, Yefet also recognizes the possibility of nonliteral interpretation, but he limits this to the sphere of actualization, which he applies exclusively to selected books or passages of intrinsic eschatological orientation or those that have a long allegorical tradition of interpretation (e.g. Minor Prophets, Song of Songs etc.). For a discussion of the problem of actualization in Yefefs commentaries, as well as the centrality of the rational, literal and contextual dimension in his exegetical approach see a comprehensive article by Meira Polliack, "On the Question of the Pesher's Influence on Karaite Exegesis," in Fifty Years of Dead Sea Scrolls Research: Studies in Memory of Jacob Licht (ed.
